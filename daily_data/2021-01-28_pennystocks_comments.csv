Gamestop (GME) and (AMC) are two failing companies who's stocks got a bump in the market due to some recent good, but ultimately inconsequential news. That jump caused large multi-billion dollar short-selling hedge funds to short GME and AMC stock with the assumption that they'd continue to fall after their bumps.

(Short selling is when someone borrows shares at a higher price then sells it with the assumption that they can buy the shares again later (1/29) at a cheaper price, give those shares back and then pocket the difference.)

This is where we the people (FB, Reddit, Twitter..) come in to ruin their day.

A bunch of us agree to flood AND HOLD! the stock with unexpected new money, causing the stock price to rise instead of fall. This causes the short sellers to lose money because they are going to have to give back those borrowed shares in the future (1/29).

As the short sellers watch the stock rise alomg with their losses, they start folding one by one and buying the stock in order to give the shares back and close their position. Buying those shares causes the stock to rise which in turn puts MORE pressure on the short sellers and more of them have to buy more shares... This is called a SHORT SQUEEZE.

On Friday (1/29), time will be up for many of the short sellers. They'll have to close out their positions by buying stock which will cause AMC and GameStop to sky rocket.

That is why you BUY NOW (apply pressure and start your investment) and HOLD. Because every person that sells is relieving the pressure and reducing the billions of dollars the hedge funds will owe us, the little guys.

183,GME,I agree with most of what you have said. However I still want to play devils advocate to a degree. Before I do though you are right that the majority of short selling is unethical. I’ve been laughing all day at these retail guys squeezing all those big funds. These big funds have been running stocks down for years and years. They all gang up and in mass short sell companies and drive them way below a fair market  valuation. This hurts lots of longs. Somewhere some how there needs to be balance/regulation in the short selling game. I don’t think it should be removed completely though. We need a little ying in our yang. If we did not have short selling we would wind up with much larger pumps. The same assholes that are driving companies below a fair market valuation would be pushing others way above a fair market valuation. Then when they were all way ahead they would dump and leave bag holders that would never have a chance of getting out from under those bags. We see this in the market already but it would be way worse. Don’t believe me?? GME will be your first example here very very soon. Short selling keeps a lot of the crazy Pumps In check and brings things back to reality. If it was regulated correctly it could do a better job than it is currently doing. But... once you start slapping on regulations where does it stop. Once you cap short selling whose to say they don’t start capping large price increases ? China does this already.

Short selling is a little bit more complex than how you are laying out. An ethical use of it would be to “short” a stock which is exactly what a lot of investors actually did with GME but only it was on its increase (P&D) instead of the decrease. This model is used ethically by a lot of investors across the globe. Short selling a stock through a brokerage is the brokerage let’s say extending you 10,000 stocks at (example) $10 and if those stocks drop to $8 and you sell the 10,000 back to the brokerage for the market value of $8 you have realized a profit of the difference. In most cases investors or firms short-selling a stock it’s betting on the short term direction of the stock to decline in value (ex. Shorting GME on Monday after the sell off) This is not investment advice. Please do your own research before opening a position in a particular stock.",0.037,0.85,0.112,0.9073

Its more about how pissy they're getting about the public thwarting their little schemes. They absolutely LOVE penny dipping the shit out of the public's pockets till its dry to the point of handouts or straight up homelessness but as soon as the public show a hint of organized finger pointing or even playing the same game they are all of sudden they're foaming at the mouth with ""THIS IS ABSOLUTELY IRRESPONSIBLE!!!, THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD BLAHBLAHBLAH!!""",0.062,0.839,0.099,0.6789

203,GME,The hedge funds likely didn’t have stakes in GME before this and they likely planned to short the stock. In order to get out of a short position you have to buy out the stocks plus the inflated value which is why they were enraged at GME going up. Shorting a stock is as useful an investment tool as options trading as well as leveraging inverse investments such as gold during market downturns. It’s legit and in turn can actually lead to a positive result for the share (depending on multiple factors). But what reddit investors did was in no way illegal and I have been following the story quite closely it’s pretty remarkable to see these things occur!,0.063,0.783,0.153,0.9013

As I said, about 80% of the float is Short Interest: [https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/SNDL/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/SNDL/short-interest/)

Also, we're heading into a Reflation Trade environment (profit cycle and inflation cycle are both accelerating). In this environment high Beta small cap stocks with high short interest stocks absolutely rip. By far the best set up ever and we're seeing it today in the markets, and even over the last several weeks...

Given that Base Effects compare against Q1 and Q2 slowdown/lockdowns, the economic acceleration that we'll see over the next couple of month will be insane. Given that weed sector is heating up given Democrat wave, SNDL is a perfect way to play it from a factor exposure 🚀🚀",0.015,0.834,0.151,0.975

The company has done several strategic acquisitions in North America, Europe, and Asia. They added 12 retail locations in airports and a casino, several fashion brands and manufacturing facilities, and a revolutionary software that they started licensing to major retailers. Expected revenue for 2021 will be in the millions of dollars. Oasis Capital just increased their investment in the company by 96.51% this last Monday. This is the institution that owns 9.99% of JAGX, a stock that recently exploded.

Recent Acquisitions: 12 ReTech, Bluwire, RedWire, Rune NYC, Emotion Apparel, 12 Fashion, 12 Retail Corp, 12 Europe AG, 12 Japan, 12 Hong Kong. This includes retail locations in 11 airports and 1 casino, which increased revenue in 2019 by 1,654%.

Through their software division, they've created a next-gen shopping tech to serve the retail sector. The software is being implemented in the company's retail stores. This serves as a proof of concept to license the software to other merchants across the globe. Soon after the software's launch, in 2019, they signed a deal with Jelmoli, one of Zurich’s most prestigious retailers and Switzerland’s biggest premium department store.  
Announcement of large retailer deal: apnews.com/press-release/pr-globenewswire/200ae164eadec9194fb314ce9ae4a830

Lastly, they have a Fashion division, which creates and sells fashionable apparel under the Rune NYC, Social Sunday, Emotion Fashion & Lexi-Lu brands. This includes manufacturing facilities in Las Vegas and Hong Kong. The subsidiaries are expected to increase their gross margins by shifting production to the Red Wire Group manufacturing operation. Also, the existing sales channels from each subsidiary will be used to introduce products from the other brands . This will increase revenue by millions of dollars.

Through their software division, they've created a next-gen shopping tech to serve the retail sector. The software is being implemented in the company's retail stores. This serves as a proof of concept to license the software to other merchants across the globe. Soon after the software's launch, in 2019, they signed a deal with Jelmoli, one of Zurich’s most prestigious retailers and Switzerland’s biggest premium department store.  
Announcement of large retailer deal: apnews.com/press-release/pr-globenewswire/200ae164eadec9194fb314ce9ae4a830

Lastly, they have a Fashion division, which creates and sells fashionable apparel under the Rune NYC, Social Sunday, Emotion Fashion & Lexi-Lu brands. This includes manufacturing facilities in Las Vegas and Hong Kong. The subsidiaries are expected to increase their gross margins by shifting production to the Red Wire Group manufacturing operation. Also, the existing sales channels from each subsidiary will be used to introduce products from the other brands . This will increase revenue by millions of dollars.

This is just some quick DD that I compiled. The stock appears to be extremely undervalued. After all the acquisitions and developments that occurred in 2019, the company was supposed to explode in 2020. However, as we recover from the pandemic and private investors start noticing the company, the stock price should increase substantially. Retail stores started reopening in the 3rd quarter of 2020. Also, as I mentioned earlier, institutions such as Oasis Capital are already noticing and betting on their success. I believe you will agree that the current share price and market cap is laughable!!

Theory on Interactive Brokers and GME

IB doesn't give sh%t about protecting Wall Street. They made their business undercutting everyone with game changing technology with low prices. They cater to professionals and take the attitude ""we're not here to judge, you want to trade it, have at it. So I think when they said they wouldn't allow customers to buy GME, they're actually concerned about their own exposure.

727,AMC,"**FULL ARTICLE BELOW:**

Nasdaq CEO **Adena Friedman** suggested Wednesday that her exchange could halt trading activity for stocks to enable investors to “recalibrate” in the event they were targeted by internet users.

She made the comment in a Morning interview with CNBC’s **Joe Kernen,** speaking in reference to price surges inspired by Reddit users. Members of the website’s “WallStreetBets” forum caused stock prices to surge to obscene heights this week for companies including GameStop and AMC Theatres.

“I think that, in general, when we evaluate how we would manage through a situation where you see a significant run-up in a stock not based on news, not based on fundamentals — what we do is we do have technology that evaluates social media chatter. **If we see a significant rise in the chatter on social media channels … we also match that up against unusual trading activity, \[and\] potentially halt that stock to allow ourselves to investigate the situation, to be able to engage with the company, and to give investors a chance to recalibrate their positions.”**

GameStop, as well as AMC Theatres, appear on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) rather than on the Nasdaq, leaving Friedman powerless to influence this week’s events. But some regulators have called on the NYSE to halt trading for at least GameStop, including Massachusetts’ top securities regulator, who said the robust investment activity wasn’t “rational.”

“There’s no rational basis for this run-up,” he added. “And it’s not just a run-up, it’s also run down. It’s extremely erratic.

728,CEO,"**FULL ARTICLE BELOW:**

Nasdaq CEO **Adena Friedman** suggested Wednesday that her exchange could halt trading activity for stocks to enable investors to “recalibrate” in the event they were targeted by internet users.

She made the comment in a Morning interview with CNBC’s **Joe Kernen,** speaking in reference to price surges inspired by Reddit users. Members of the website’s “WallStreetBets” forum caused stock prices to surge to obscene heights this week for companies including GameStop and AMC Theatres.

“I think that, in general, when we evaluate how we would manage through a situation where you see a significant run-up in a stock not based on news, not based on fundamentals — what we do is we do have technology that evaluates social media chatter. **If we see a significant rise in the chatter on social media channels … we also match that up against unusual trading activity, \[and\] potentially halt that stock to allow ourselves to investigate the situation, to be able to engage with the company, and to give investors a chance to recalibrate their positions.”**

GameStop, as well as AMC Theatres, appear on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) rather than on the Nasdaq, leaving Friedman powerless to influence this week’s events. But some regulators have called on the NYSE to halt trading for at least GameStop, including Massachusetts’ top securities regulator, who said the robust investment activity wasn’t “rational.”

“I really think at this point it calls upon the regulators, in this case, the New York Stock Exchange, to consider simply suspending it for a month and stop trading it,” Massachusetts Commonwealth Secretary **William Galvin** said in a statement to *Barron’s*. “These small and unsophisticated investors are probably going to get hurt by this.

As I said, about 80% of the float is Short Interest: [https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/SNDL/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/SNDL/short-interest/)

Also, we're heading into a Reflation Trade environment (profit cycle and inflation cycle are both accelerating). In this environment high Beta small cap stocks with high short interest stocks absolutely rip. By far the best set up ever and we're seeing it today in the markets, and even over the last several weeks...

The Q India, QYOU Media Inc.'s Hindi language youth-oriented channel now available in and on over 650 million homes and devices in India, has further expanded its monetization efforts with early January integrations for social brands via influencer marketing. New clients include Policy Bazaar, Groww, AIMA and Pullman Aerocity. These Influencer Marketing alliances, representing a separate and unique revenue stream going forward, have quickly booked in early January a total of $40K with an expanding pipeline of engagements in negotiation. The Influencer Marketing segment of The Q India business is separate from and in addition to the recently announced $200K in television ad campaigns booked in January as the company embarks on executing its monetization plans for 2021.
Brands are increasingly turning to Influencer Marketing campaigns to reach younger audiences. Hindu Business Line estimates advertising revenues in India to reach over $10 Billion USD. The company estimates that Influencer Marketing revenue represents approximately 10% of this total. Krishna Menon, CRO of The Q India commented, ""In early 2021 we have added new influencer marketing clients during the monetization phase of our strategy. The Q India is uniquely positioned as a content brand featuring programming exclusively created by social influencers. This unique business strategy is contributing to the company's rapid growth in viewership as these influencers promote their own content on The Q. Consequently, The Q is positioned to offer Influencer Marketing campaigns more optimally than any other television brand"".
The Q India channel, originally launched in July 2017 has experienced rapid growth in late 2020 and early 2021 after the company invested for three and a half years in a strategy of programming the best digital and social content in India and achieving mass distribution across television, OTT and mobile platforms. The company recently announced the beginning of ad sales with premium clients tied to rising viewership on its linear television channel. The Influencer Marketing segment of the business represents a new revenue segment with significant growth potential given the relationships held with key digital social stars combined with their desire to promote further via all three distribution channels available to The Q India. Additional new advertising and influencer marketing partnerships are expected to launch throughout the quarter.
Curt Marvis, CEO and Co-Founder of QYOU Media added, ""As social video becomes more entrenched in people's lives and takes on more functional uses beyond entertainment, such as e-commerce and shopping, the role of influencers is set to grow. When e-commerce and social video converge, influencers will become increasingly vital intermediaries, helping to connect brands with consumers in highly resonant, authentic ways that can deliver immediate returns"".

I'll admit, I don't know a whole lot about this company, and while they project a nice IRR at 58%, I can confidently say that there are better resource companies located directly in Europe, which I think are significantly better speculations. 

Exploratory miners are speculative plays, so I'm not sure how you determined that this company is undervalued, which you wrote in your other post. To date, this company has completed no development. Their production timeframe might be several years away, and they'll likely incur some dilution until then.
