7,GME," Well, that's really what we call fluctuations. It's a feature of the stock market, not a bug. So yes, you should stop watching the price movement all the time. It's like a couple walking a dog. The couple knows where they're going but not the dog. The couple moves in a predictable, linear manner. Whereas the excited dog will tend to move left and right in a more unpredictable manner. But no matter how much the dog moves, it will always be anchored to the movement of the couple. In the end, over a longer distance, the dog is really moving along a linear path as much as it moved left and right.

The problem with most people is that they focus too much on the dog, rather than the couple. They care more about how the dog is moving when they should really care more about the couple. If you are strongly convinced that the couple is moving in the right direction, then why do you care in which way the dog moves?

Predicting the couple's movement is what Roaring Kitty is basically trying to do and that comes from fundamental analysis and his understanding of the business. He's a value investor and he knows the company like GME inside and out. He's analysing the couple.

Whereas some folks here (or tards, apes, or whatever you call yourselves), may be focusing too much on the dog and that's no way to invest in a sustainable manner. It's easy to tell if you are couple watcher or a dog watcher. If you're a couple watcher, you wouldn't care about volatility, and you wouldn't feel emotional about it. You wouldn't bat an eye when your position goes up or down 20% to 30%.",DerpyNerdy,115,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m2cbs1/my_portfolio_this_week/gqj0izn/,0.045,0.825,0.13,0.9818

130,GME," 🚀🚀🚀 [Good Morning Everyone!!!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WufKsOhkTL8) 🚀🚀🚀

🚀🚀🚀🚀 GME is on the SSR list through the end of the week 🚀🚀🚀🚀

**Tl;dr for Apes** 

🐻🐻🐻 📉 📉 📉 yesterday cause 🚯🚯🚯 for today. GME free to 🚀🚀🚀 safe today.

**[Click Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m237es/gme_megathread_part_2_for_march_10_2021/gqgy59k/) for yesterday's commentary.**

If you held on yesterday, you are true apes. The SHITers lunch time attack dropped the price nearly 150 points before reverting back into positive territory hitting 7 halts along the way. This was truly a desperate attempt to try and contain the 🚀 from reaching the 🌕. I believe that GME was in the middle of a compounding Gamma Squeeze which was why they fired the nuke. 

What this means though is that GME is officially on the [Short Sale Restrictions List](http://puu.sh/Hoaui/d57dde33ba.png). This list can be found [HERE](https://www.nyse.com/markets/nyse-arca/notices), navigating to short sale restrictions, hitting current, and accessing the latest file.

**ELI5 Short Sale Restrictions**

When a stock drops 10% from where it ended the previous day, it goes on the Short Sale Restrictions list.

When you short a stock, you can sell it for a price below it's current price. Do this multiple times in quick succession, and you can trick people into thinking the price has dropped. 

The restriction means that you can only sell a short at a price HIGHER than it's current price. This means that you can't use short sales to artificially lower the stock price.

GME just got a star and is mostly invincible from short attacks today. This is a power play for GME and will give it mostly unrestricted access to appreciate naturally. GME can continue to make huge gains without fear of a manipulated attack. 

**What do you mean by mostly invincible?**

1) People can still naturally sell GME. Since so many held on after the attack yesterday, I don't foresee this being an issue today.

2) Only GME is restricted. There are other stocks that have GME in their portfolios that can still be shorted. I honestly don't know how this works well enough to explain it properly, but from my limited understanding, I don't believe these will have a major impact. Obviously if I'm wrong, I'm sure someone will correct me in the replies.

**8:30 Pre-Market Update**

GME ended yesterday at 265. Current GME pre-market price has been hanging around 250. Before anyone panics, realize most Apes don't trade pre-market. Once the market opens, we'll have a much better understanding of GME's trajectory today.

Yesterday Closing Price: 265.00

Current Pre-Market Price: 250.96

**9:41 Updates**

GME has been hovering around it's premarket price so far. I believe if GME hits -10% at some point today, it will go into tomorrow's SSR as well. If itit does that this morning and then skyrockets, the SHITers will have no way to stopping deep OTM options to become ITM tomorrow. 

Current price: 242.52

**9:51 Update**

Wow. GME went down 10% before starting a climb back up. If I understand the SSR rule correctly, GME now has 12 and a half hours of uninterrupted 🚀🚀🚀 time. If there is sufficient buy pressure, the SHITers won't be able to stop GMEs ascent. This might have been been best case scenario for GME. We'll see what happens throughout the day.

Current price: 246.93

**10:03 Update**

We have liftoff 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Current price: 272.00

**10:15 Update**

GME seems to have had a small engine issue and is hovering around 268.

Current price: 269.37

**10:43 Update**

This update is coming just as GME broke 275. The volatility  seems to have been just natural volatility. Don't fear the large swings as GME is still recovering from it's large shock yesterday. The gamma squeeze from yesterday seems to have been eliminated. An upward swing at this point will need to come from natural buying pressure until GME reaches its next gamma squeeze threshold. We'll see if this current rise is an actual indication of strength or just more volatility.

Current price: 276

**11:12 Update**

GME has been hovering around 272 though it did drop a bit since the start of my update. Still no major events have happened since opening bell. 

People have mentioned that shorts available are at 850,000. With the nuke fired yesterday, I don't want to speculate when exactly those were closed. What matters is whether that number goes up today. 

I am speculating, but I feel like there might be a tactic where SHIT 1 borrows shorts, sell them at a higher price to SHIT 2 who accumulates actual shares. SHIT two then waits for a low volume moment and tries to fabricate an attack with actual shares. It's essentially adding an extra step to the process, but they risk forcing a catalyst by selling the short at a higher price. That might explain why 50,000 shorts were borrowed today. I have no idea if this is A) plausible or B) legal, but I'll keep an eye out in case we have strange drops. So far though, it just seems like general volatility.

Current price: 266.46

-do nothing at work.

-stare at the GME ticker and whisper to myself “Go go go go” as it slowly goes up.

-come into the GME megathread for some sweet confirmation bias.

-rinse, repeat.

146,GME," Alright, since I got a 3-day ban for saying “ret@ard” in the title of my last post, I will keep the WSB talk to a minimum here. We all know that the attack yesterday was shorts being injected into the market in a massive volume. We were able to recover and stay around 250-260 range WHICH IS FUCKING PHENOMENAL, but what can we expect today? Well according [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME) they only have 150,000 more shares to short. We don’t know how many they used yesterday to plummet the price, but we do know that they don’t have much more to do so with. Furthermore, according to [http://finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=14%3A0P000002CH&sdkVersion=2.59.0](http://finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=14%3A0P000002CH&sdkVersion=2.59.0) the short percent of float is still 52%. We backed them into a corner, and they are using every tactic they have left to scare off paper hands. Me personally, I held from 400 to 40 so I WILL BE HOLDING, and if my wife’s boyfriend says its okay, I WILL BE BUYING MORE AT THE DIP THAT WILL SURE COME TODAY. We are in the endgame and their shot yesterday made it more than obvious boys, make sure you save some of your tendies for your date with Plotkin’s wife.

220,DD," Please help to inform your fellow apes on what exactly SSR is so they don’t fall for dirty tricks.

TLDR: Remember apes, even though GME is now on SSR they can short the stock on an uptick! Stay strong, ignore the fuckery and hold the line! 

——

Usually the hedgies can short a stock at any time they want. Yesterday they had a small, short lived victory and GME dropped more than 10% (how’d that work out for ya Melvin?) which means it has been placed on SSR (Short Sale Restriction) 

This means that if the price is already going down, they are not allowed to short it. However, if the price is going up, they are allowed to continue their shenanigans.

My thoughts on this is that lunchtime yesterday was a test.

If they’re sat on the shorts that went from iBorrowDesk yesterday (right now they have more potential ammo), then they may try to drive the price down every time it starts going up. They may still have a lot of ammo left in the bank. 

Now if every time the price goes up it starts to tank immediately afterwards, that could cause people to panic and think everyone is selling off their stock which would then cause people to sell, driving the price lower and hitting stop losses continuing the drop.

If I was a Melvin, and I was trying to drive the price down, I would short just enough to drop it each time it goes up and then wait to see if that was enough, if not, throw more at it the next time it goes up until I ran out of ammo. I would probably even let it spike to scare people into thinking that the top has been hit.

This could be an especially effective tactic for them if people don’t realise that SSR does not stop them from shorting completely!

Ape may be retarded, but ape not dumb. Ignore the bullshit that is bound to unfold over the next 24/48 hours. If you have read the DD and been following this for a while, you know just how fucked they are.

275,DD," The question I have is that this author seems dead set that the shorts have all covered their positions down...that may be, but I’ve read some persuasive DD that the volume numbers just don’t support the sort of volume needed to cover all the short interest. 

If this is a pure gamma squeeze, then an artificial drop like today could potential break the cycle and send the prices back down. However, if the DD is correct and the short interest of 29% or whatever is inaccurate, then the squeeze is still on so long as enough folks hold and support the price.

277,GME," So in a gamma swarm there is no short positions, as those are hedged options. Hedged option writing means the writer profits whether the stock goes up or down, it is just the profits are limited by the spread. 800 dollar options are set to expire on 3-19. Which is a fair amount of profit for anyone hedging. What this could mean ultimately is that HF spun the tactic. They saw everyone buying the stock and holding it. The thing is, they don’t expect that anyone would buy a share at 1000 plus. They know that GME holders have no exit plan, so they expect certain people to be holding the bag. Whether that be RI or the DTCC is yet to be seen.

It’s just so easy to get emotionally invested and it just feels like a place as big as Forbes should be reputable. Then I realized I remembered them printing some SHADY ASS UNTRUE SHIT at least once a week over the slow(ish) 3 week long climb we seen since mid to end of February (to get people to stop buying GME is ALWAYS the goal whether it be a distraction or an outright statement that GME is a bad bet). 

The view good from here tho. And if nothing else fuck the man. 

My conclusion: the hedgies holding shorts have CONNECTIONS AT FORBES. either that or someone is getting paid on the side. 

No matter WHAT, we can see clearly that Forbes is NOT on The side of DIAMOND HANDED AUTISTS historically speaking.

While they do add a few legitimate facts in their story, the predictions are the shady part. 

Personally I think they’re strategy is to sprinkle in market predictions that they know are illegitimate (and also based on the idea that shorts have been covered, which they haven’t, (it’s cheaper to lie about that and hope it influences the market) because of the increase in short bets that happened weeks ago due to conventional beliefs about what happens when a stock rises and falls the way GME has.

Despite the volume of trades, the prices are so high that there’s no way anyone covered those without us noticing on the slow, I’m betting that shit would bankrupt their asses.

Every article or anti GME statement by news networks and printed articles shows us those fucks quivering like lil bitches. Like why else talk about it in the news. They’d probably be better off shutting up. It always makes me feel like I’m on the side that’s gettin *LOTS OF TENDIES* when I see those articles.

291,GME," >I skimmed it but how many times did they mention the shorts have covered?

They said the following about the shorts:

1. Short volume was greatly reduced in January, apparently (this was vague) by forced covering during the spike and by controlled covering right after.
2. The shorted positions in January got all the publicity, but the activity with Call Options was perhaps just as important or even more important. (This part seemed evasive to me. Based on their analysis, Call Options probably didn't *cause* the short squeeze, but they ensured that it got out of control.)
3. While it is true, as many have said, that Reddit crowds couldn't really wrangle a short squeeze by themselves when the industry investors have such deep pockets...
4. ...Reddit crowds *could* massively influence the Call Option mechanics, even in the absence of an imminent short squeeze. This caused the ""surprising"" resurgence that we see now.

&#x200B;

**tl;dr** seems to be, **""Reddit doesn't have the leverage to get into a Shorts war but it does have the leverage for a Call Options war and this has caught the real investors by surprise.""**

But...

Does that even make sense? Are large crowds of WSB users buying Call Options? I bought some GME because of all of this, but I don't even know WTF a Call Options **is.** And did u/DeepFuckingValue talk about Call Options at all? Maybe I missed it because I don't understand the subject, but I didn't hear it, which is suspicious.

You're reading this as though the guy is complaining about the tactic or criticizing the approach to winning a trade against a cornered counterparty? It really seems more like he is being complimentary of the tactic. If you read the entire paragraph as opposed to the snippet you quoted, this becomes clear:

>The GME event is in fact the result of a process that is hyper-rational. It is based on highly accurate calculations of specific outcomes which possess a much higher degree of certainty than is the case for normal investment decisions. There is no “madness of crowds” here. It is a premeditated, predatory take-down of a cornered and defenseless counterparty.

He is saying plainly that the predatory take-down is hyper-rational and based on a logical approach. Cornering a defenseless counterparty is simply intelligent in aiming to be on the winning side of a trade. It's a compliment.

336,GME," Options trading gives you more leverage per dollar than simply purchasing a stock. Essentially, if you purchase a call option and the stock price doesn't increase by the expiration date, the option expires worthless. So unlike purchasing a stock, you lose money by ""default"", in exchange for a much higher profit margin if the stock rises significantly above the current price compared to a traditional long position. In fact, the increase in leverage is so great that none of this would have happened without it. Retail traders on their own simply don't have enough capital to cause a short squeeze by buying the stock, but options allow you to have an effect on several times more shares than you otherwise would be able to.

341,GME," So I got drunk and watched like 30 youtube videos because I have adhd and hyperfocus is a thing.  You're basically correct but you left out a few things that are important.  First, if you buy a contract and do NOT have enough money in your account when that contract expires in the money (meaning that the strike price is less than the share price) then your contract will automatically exercise and that means you're going to be buying those shares with margin.  Basically, you're borrowing a shitload of money from your broker to buy the shares.  Now if you were only doing that for like 5 minutes because you were going to sell immediately then that's cool, but the reality in that scenario is that the order executes after hours on Friday, and then you're bag-holding until Monday at open when you'd better hope to fuck that the share price is still higher than what you paid on Friday and you can cover your margin (plus any interest for those like 3 days or whatever it actually is).  That's how that one dude accidentally made like $120k on here that one time; he happened to luck out and the price went up on Monday when he sold the shares he had.  


Next, when you sell the contract there has to be someone to buy it so there has to be liquidity in the market or you're fucked.  Some dumbass n00b in r/thetagang who doesn't actually understand shit can write a contract for $5k on GME and you can buy it because you're retarded, but unless some other retard wants to buy your contract when you go to sell it then you're fucked bag-holding the option to bag-hold.  You need to understand liquidity which is where options volume starts to be a thing.  


Last, the additional ""other shit"" is the extrinsic value of the contract.  Hang on, I need to go grab another beer.  
Ok, got another beer.  Anyway, extrinsic value is like in that movie Dumb and Dumber when Jim Carrey is trying to shoot his shot and he's like ""so you mean like 1 in 1000 then?""  When he says that, there's a chance and 1 in 1000 sucks but it's still non-zero so that's worth something.  When what's-her-name replied ""more like 1 in 1000000"" and Jim Carrey is like ""so you mean there's a chance?""  That's Theta, which is the thing that says how fucked you are over time if you buy an option.  Sure, your strike price is way above the share price but the contract hasn't expired yet and the stock is stupid-volatile, so if the 🚀 happens to take off in the next 5 minutes then you still score, so there is very much a chance and that ""chance"" is determined (sort of) by a combination of the IV, delta, and to some extent vega.  Basically, the ""chance"" is still a chance so the option's value is the value of the stonk (intrinsic value) plus the value of whatever the market thinks that ""chance"" is worth (extrinsic value).    


So now fast forward to when Jim Carrey discovers that what's-her-name is married and he's like ""what ever happened to 1 in 1000000?""  That's what happens the moment the option expires.  Now there's no chance, so that extra possibility of actually making money is precisely zero.  The process of going from 1 in 1000 to 1 in 1000000 to ""she's married"" is theta decay, and it works almost exactly like Jim Carrey trying to get with Lauren Holly (I just looked the movie up on imbd) right up until she says she's married.  Still, the WHOLE POINT of having an option is that extra value, and ""extrinsic value"" if you will, that is the 1 in 100000 chance that it will expire in the money that has NOTHING to do with the price of the stonk.  If you buy an option, you need to understand the extrinsic value.  If you sell an option, you NEED to understand extrinsic value and theta decay or you're going to be both retarded and fucked over when that option gets close to expiration because someone else will now take your shares and you won't have money to buy more shares which is as paper hands as it gets.  If you don't understand these things, then go watch youtube videos of other apes explaining options to apes so that apes can sell options to apes and even if apes lose shares, other apes gain shares so apes still win because apes strong together.  


Now for all of you retards out there who bought a call, you did a thing called ""buy to open"" on that option.  To get rid of it and take your gains to buy more shares you need to ""sell to close"" on an option that's the same strike price and expiration as the option you bought.  Go to where you bought the option and click ""sell"" this time (you may be unfamiliar with this button but in this context it's ok) and make sure you pick the same date and strike price as when you bought the option.

And he's got all the ""news"" talking heads saying his Reddit name on morning television.  They are trying to make him out to be some shady character, and he couldn't be more pleasant of a person.

375,AT," I appreciate your time and effort putting together this DD, unfortunately there's one major criticism I have with it. When looking at the 1 day charts, you can see the pattern emerge that resembles the sockeye salmon AT FIRST GLANCE. However, if you get real close and use extra green colored crayons, you'll actually see that the pattern more closely replicates A CHINOOK SALMON PATTERN. The fundamentals are the same, but I am unsure if the detailed analysis will still work mathematically, so I'd appreciate some feedback and insight.

Furthermore, there are a few variables that may need to be taken into consideration. First, we must consider the concept of seasonality. If the salmon were in season, it may be likely that they are traveling upstream naturally as opposed to downstream. In addition, we would see a significant increase in impregnated salmon, thus our roe index would drastically increase. The roe index is INDIRECTLY related to the stock's MACD.

Lastly, I'd like to point out a potential fallacy in your logic, as we end up in an impasse. You see, following the classic bear-trap stockeye salmon trend, there's a fatal flaw. Stockeye salmon also attract the eyes of another feral beast. The cat. And who do we know is not a cat? DFV. So logically, this type of movement would attract a cat as well as a bear. Given that DFV is, in fact, not a cat, following this logic, he should not be attracted to this stock movement. BUT HE IS! His Twitter activity within the past few days has increased far more since the emergence of this nautical trend. Moving forward from here, I think you bring up many valid points, but it may be risky to incorporate the fish ladder attack in the off chance that the the F in DFV actually stands for feline.",IkeaMicrowave,8,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m2huy9/technical_analysis_of_todays_gme_movement/gqjdlzz/,0.062,0.842,0.096,0.8777

482,IP," Because some of you are actually interested, here are some additional details on how to run this.

I am using the Philips Hue Bridge, but with some additional work this should be feasible for other systems, as well. The script itself is written in Python. Save the content to some file, e.g. [gme.py](https://gme.py) and install the dependencies using pip or pipenv, e.g `pipenv install phue yahoo_fin pydub`

Continuing using Pipenv you could run `pipenv shell` followed by `python gme.py` which should start this annoying mess.

Of course you need to update the IP of your Hue Bridge and you need to provide audio files and update the paths accordingly. You can also disable the audio ""feature"" by setting `AUDIO = False`

489,IP," Quick tutorial for Windows:

First you need to install WSL: https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/ubuntu-on-windows#1-overview

Open WSL and you'll get a prompt like user@computer:~$

Then we install python3 and pip. You'll need to enter your windows password:

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt install python3 python3-pip

Next we set up pipenv:

    sudo pip3 install pipenv

Then set up the env like u/Babumts has (pydub is only used in his code):

    sudo pipenv install phue yahoo_fin pydub
    pipenv shell

So that sets up all of the environment that we need. Next we want to paste the script into a file to run. With python this can be tricky because the white space matters in python and sometimes pasting messes it up. You'll want everything to be in the correct tab that we've got in the python code above. For example, flush left is no tab, then the code block like the one starting with 'price' is one tab over, then the contents of the if statements are two tabs etc. So to do this we can use nano:

    nano gme.py

Paste the code, fix it, then to save type 'Ctrl-X Y'. Note, for the first time you run, you need to fix the IP address to the IP address of your hue hub and you need to remove the # before the connect() command. Press the button on your hub, run the code, then you can put the # back in front of connect(). You just need it the first time to tell your hub that this is a valid device. 

To run the code just type:

490,API," Maybe? What are you trying to do? There's no ""right"" or ""wrong"" language to work with in a general sense -- they each have their pros and cons.

C is **very hard** to learn, but it's the core of the software world. Proper autists can write unbeatably fast and concise code in C. The rest of us tards write shitty code that usually manages to work while pissing leaked memory everywhere. Most other languages have features or syntax that are similar to or directly shared from C, and if not, the concepts are still similar enough to apply when learning another language.

Python is C-ish in syntax, but much easier and forgiving. If you write something stupid, the interpreter can generally keep your code safe anyway (or tell you to suck less and refuse to run your shitty code). It's a scripting language, meaning you don't have to compile it to run, which is nice when trying to work stuff out. There's amazing tools out there, like Jupyter, which give entirely new ways to approach code compared to the tools for C. It's *EASY*, just read the code in the grandparent post.

If you're well down the road to becoming an autist with C, I encourage you to stay on that path. Python will be a walk in the park when you're ready. As a bonus on that path, the standard Python interpreter is written in C and has a well-documented API. This allows you to have code written in C that performs at C's speed, but natively works with your Python code and can manipulate Python objects.

If you're not very far into learning C, Python might be a good choice to accelerate your education. You can focus more on building things than learning how to manage memory and pointers. Javascript is painful, but the ecosystem for it is enormous and it's ubiquitous. Check out golang as well.

🚀🚀🚀🚀 GME is on the SSR list through the end of the week 🚀🚀🚀🚀

**Tl;dr for Apes** 

🐻🐻🐻 📉 📉 📉 yesterday cause 🚯🚯🚯 for today. GME free to 🚀🚀🚀 safe today.

**[Click Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m237es/gme_megathread_part_2_for_march_10_2021/gqgy59k/) for yesterday's commentary.**

If you held on yesterday, you are true apes. The SHITers lunch time attack dropped the price nearly 150 points before reverting back into positive territory hitting 7 halts along the way. This was truly a desperate attempt to try and contain the 🚀 from reaching the 🌕. I believe that GME was in the middle of a compounding Gamma Squeeze which was why they fired the nuke. 

What this means though is that GME is officially on the [Short Sale Restrictions List](http://puu.sh/Hoaui/d57dde33ba.png). This list can be found [HERE](https://www.nyse.com/markets/nyse-arca/notices), navigating to short sale restrictions, hitting current, and accessing the latest file.

**ELI5 Short Sale Restrictions**

When a stock drops 10% from where it ended the previous day, it goes on the Short Sale Restrictions list.

When you short a stock, you can sell it for a price below it's current price. Do this multiple times in quick succession, and you can trick people into thinking the price has dropped. 

The restriction means that you can only sell a short at a price HIGHER than it's current price. This means that you can't use short sales to artificially lower the stock price.

GME just got a star and is mostly invincible from short attacks today. This is a power play for GME and will give it mostly unrestricted access to appreciate naturally. GME can continue to make huge gains without fear of a manipulated attack. 

**What do you mean by mostly invincible?**

1) People can still naturally sell GME. Since so many held on after the attack yesterday, I don't foresee this being an issue today.

2) Only GME is restricted. There are other stocks that have GME in their portfolios that can still be shorted. I honestly don't know how this works well enough to explain it properly, but from my limited understanding, I don't believe these will have a major impact. Obviously if I'm wrong, I'm sure someone will correct me in the replies.

**8:30 Pre-Market Update**

GME ended yesterday at 265. Current GME pre-market price has been hanging around 250. Before anyone panics, realize most Apes don't trade pre-market. Once the market opens, we'll have a much better understanding of GME's trajectory today.

Yesterday Closing Price: 265.00

Current Pre-Market Price: 250.96

**9:41 Updates**

GME has been hovering around it's premarket price so far. I believe if GME hits -10% at some point today, it will go into tomorrow's SSR as well. If itit does that this morning and then skyrockets, the SHITers will have no way to stopping deep OTM options to become ITM tomorrow. 

Current price: 242.52

**9:51 Update**

Wow. GME went down 10% before starting a climb back up. If I understand the SSR rule correctly, GME now has 12 and a half hours of uninterrupted 🚀🚀🚀 time. If there is sufficient buy pressure, the SHITers won't be able to stop GMEs ascent. This might have been been best case scenario for GME. We'll see what happens throughout the day.

Current price: 246.93

**10:03 Update**

We have liftoff 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Current price: 272.00

**10:15 Update**

GME seems to have had a small engine issue and is hovering around 268.

Current price: 269.37

**10:43 Update**

This update is coming just as GME broke 275. The volatility  seems to have been just natural volatility. Don't fear the large swings as GME is still recovering from it's large shock yesterday. The gamma squeeze from yesterday seems to have been eliminated. An upward swing at this point will need to come from natural buying pressure until GME reaches its next gamma squeeze threshold. We'll see if this current rise is an actual indication of strength or just more volatility.

Current price: 276

**11:12 Update**

GME has been hovering around 272 though it did drop a bit since the start of my update. Still no major events have happened since opening bell. 

People have mentioned that shorts available are at 850,000. With the nuke fired yesterday, I don't want to speculate when exactly those were closed. What matters is whether that number goes up today. 

I am speculating, but I feel like there might be a tactic where SHIT 1 borrows shorts, sell them at a higher price to SHIT 2 who accumulates actual shares. SHIT two then waits for a low volume moment and tries to fabricate an attack with actual shares. It's essentially adding an extra step to the process, but they risk forcing a catalyst by selling the short at a higher price. That might explain why 50,000 shorts were borrowed today. I have no idea if this is A) plausible or B) legal, but I'll keep an eye out in case we have strange drops. So far though, it just seems like general volatility.

Current price: 266.46

**12:33 Update**

Someone answer me this - if GME is on the short sale restrictions list, how come people are able to borrow shares? According to IBorrowDesk, the short availability went down from 850,000 to 800,000. The price also happens to fall during that time as well. Isn't this supposed to be restricted? This seems like a traditional lunch hour attack, but it seems like some people didn't get the memo that you're not supposed to do that.

I'm on lunch, so I'll be doing more research on this, but this seems fishy to me.

Current price: 255.64

**12:45 Update**

Let me clarify my earlier update. I understand that short selling is not restricted. I also understand that you can still short, however it must be at a higher price than it's current price. 

By selling a short at a higher than current price, how can that end up lowering the price? GME has already hit the -10% threshold to be on the SSR list tomorrow. They can't do a traditional short attack until Monday at the earliest. I don't understand why they don't wait until Monday to borrow shares.

Someone borrowed 50,000 shares right before the price took a downturn into the Red. This happened right before lunch. Attacks during lunch are not uncommon. SHITs do this so that when those working look at their portfolio during lunch and see it's gone down, they panic attack.

I have no problem with the price being negative right now. The volatility we saw seemed normal. However, right before noon, GME was climbing up towards 265. The price has then been on a downward trajectory and the shorts available went down by 50,000. If GME was not on the SSR, I would chalk this to a normal short attack. I just want to understand how they pulled this off with the SSR restriction in place. The issue is that with the SSR in place, people might assume that this is a natural selling push, not a manipulated attack.

What's the point of the SSR if it doesn't prevent these kinds of attacks from happening?

Shorts available: 800,000

Current price: 256.95

**1:11 Update**

GME is making it's way back up to where it's been hanging out most of the day, near yesterday's close. There has been no major shift as of yet. GME seems to be overall stable even with that possible attack earlier.

I'm still trying to figure out whether the shares borrowed earlier had an actual impact on the price of the stock. My conspiracy theory mind tells me that this might've been a test to see if they could still artificially lower the price. If we see a major sell off today or tomorrow alongside more shares borrowed, I'm willing to believe that the SHITers have found a way to circumvent the SSR.

Again, my worry is that the SHITers might make a future manipulated sell off seem like a natural sell off by claiming that they couldn't have done anything because of the SSR. 

Shorts available: 800,000

Current price: 256.86

**1:50 update**

Nothing new. Still hanging out around close to yesterday's close. Most of what we've seen has been general volatility. Don't be surprised if GME stays in this region for the rest of the day. There's no real upward momentum at the moment and buy/sell power has remained fairly balanced. I believe either news or a whale will be required for a major shift.

Reminder that there are still a ton of shorts that need to close. The SHITs are continuously paying interest until the shorts close.

Shorts available: 800,000

Current price: 261.93 

**2:40 Update**

No update with price. 50,000 shorts were opened. 

I've been so focused on GME regarding shorts that I didn't consider how other stocks may be a part of the equation. These shorts that are opened could be not to hurt GME, but rather to invest in other companies. 50,000 shares at 260 is $13,000,000. There may be people who believe they can invest that money elsewhere and make a % profit higher than the % loss they incur from buying back a higher GME price.

I wish there was a way that we can see where the money from shorts go.

Shorts available: 750,000

Current price: 257.94

Well that was boring. The most exciting thing happened right out of opening bell where GME triggered SSR for tomorrow as well. It's hung around yesterday close all day throug regular volatility. A small sell off at the end brought the stock to 255.77.

What is the plan for the future? How are they going to achieve that? And what steps are already being taken to transform the company?

I should have written you prior, but did not know for a certainty where to direct. I sincerely hope this letter I write will find it's way to you and your beloved mister. How I long to see his chiseled jaw rested gently against thine bosoms'! Oh glory!

You will doubtless have learned the details of the Great GME War before this reaches you. The losses of the 28th were dreadful. A mere fortnight prior one could not have imagined the tragedy that besieged us that day. Many a paper handed retard were smite from the field of battle, their voices silenced by the unrelenting march of the vindictive hedgies.

But on we marched, with our brothers in misery perched upon our sturdy shoulders. Despite our tiresome predicament, fortune smiles upon us as many a foreign retard and autist offered assistance in our endeavor. Twas much sought after since the hedgies sneakily thieved much of the ammunition in the early dawn. We shall persevere and hold our ground.

614,GME," 'We should see the GME short squeeze continuing': S3 Partners

“We should see the GME short squeeze continuing and more short covering in the stock as mark-to-market losses mount,” he told Yahoo Finance late Wednesday. “But as the stock continues its rapid climb, there will be short sellers waiting in the wings looking for entry points if this rally loses steam and GME’s stock price retraces.”

627,GME," i asked this same question today too, because i forgot, SRR just means they cant short it going down, they can only short it on up ticks, they can only suppress it and not attack it.

they really need this below 250 and 300 based on the options chain.

so this the best they need to do before it was gonna take off yesterday.

passed 300 and every 50 up, is just adding to the load and there is a giant load at 800, but i doubt we can get there this week. but this is why there is a theorized gamma this week, because we are ahead of the low load and we were way passed the 300 load before,

but remember them shorting is just digging them deeper and kicks it down the road. and they are fighting week to week, going deeper into shorts, with days left to FTD deadlines, QR reports, upward mometum in the entire market, and time running out for the DTCC rule, all while the stock is still positive day to day, so just hold and feel better about it all, (not financial advice)

**Edit**: To address your follow up, selling is selling, if in a moment selling volume is higher than buy volume then price goes down, from what i see is if a million shares sold at one price then it just goes down, right? like yesterday, they sold a ton of shorts all at once, looked like they just did in a load, im sure a good portion of that was done at one price as opposed to one after the other, because there are companies that sell shares for big players, to sell in pieces to get better prices and to keep bullish sentiment.

the hedgies wanted to sell at once to scare the momentum. but other hedgies, algorithms, day trader and bots are all trading around and yes just a few retailors sell but very few from what iv seen people on WSB DD surmise and definite barely a soul on this thread sold anything, which is why it bounces around.

but although they shorted 100,000 as of this update, the price has barely moved, the suppression doesnt just scare people, i presume  it messes with day trader and bots trying to swing profits, just a presumption, im happy for people to discuss this more. not to mention the etfs that are being shorted to attack GME, again,

this happening sitting at 250 is just juicy to me as opposed to 40.

**Edit 2**: something everyone should just remember, they will do whatever they can to scare everyone, and at any drop is scary, even for me, but knowing the facts that the hedgies are screwed, that we were right, and the media fuckery, i can stomach it, the facts haven't changed, a fuck load of us wouldnt just sell off with zero news and even news wouldn't budge a fuck load of us. there have been 3 giant event that were majorly unexplained until a day to days later. so knowing no one is fucking scared and everyone had faith in this, the forethought to hold and wait for a deeper analysis, im not scared by any of this shit, i know it sucks when the normie friends we all have sell and shit but they only have a share a piece or whatever, each of us on average have hundred and thousands and millions total and then some. i say ride the wave, dont set a true price for yourself, and just safely watch the chart for the actual  squeeze to happen and just keep your eyes and ears open and make good decisions. im holding for DFV and the people in poverty, cause they both deserve it.

Right in the middle of winding down a 10,000 ft mountain road the stock dropped. Next 30 minutes I had call of the void to yeet myself over that cliff, just like this lovely stock did.

BUT NO. I didn't. I held strong. Got myself a delicious breakfast burrito at the bottom with my RKT gains, and rest of the day I ate a nice burrito and ran through about 2 lighters worth of cigarettes as I calmed myself down from that amazing journey.

It's important to state I'm paying off a huge chunk of debt this month and I'm disciplined on that goal, taxes came back, both fed and state went immediately to the debt both checks.  The upcoming stimmie will do the same.  So in here with my limited $400 play money I skimmed off non market investments.  I watched my GME stalemate at $40 and paper handed.  That decision I regretted while doing it but not a few days later, I realized I had to revert that mistake and wash sell'd myself back in 1 share for $135.  Days later i upped my position averaging down with a single share but at $120.  Just days ago I sold off my FTEC at a minimal loss, it had been rising very slowly after tanking so it cost me about $3 to exit the position and land another GME share with the rest going bullish into VGAC.

908,VGAC," I got into this knowing as much as Jon Snow.  I had every intention on getting into stocks specifically I wanted a portfolio of positions on AMD TSM NVDA UMC, I wanted to go all in long on silicon manufacturers for starters.  Even my IRA was holding ETF called FTEC spread across the same sectors.  I bought 1 @ 95 end of Jan after squeeze 1.  That and 2x AMD was my entry into the market.  It's important to state I'm paying off a huge chunk of debt this month and I'm disciplined on that goal, taxes came back, both fed and state went immediately to the debt both checks.  The upcoming stimmie will do the same.  So in here with my limited $400 play money I skimmed off non market investments.  I watched my GME stalemate at $40 and paper handed.  That decision I regretted while doing it but not a few days later, I realized I had to revert that mistake and wash sell'd myself back in 1 share for $135.  Days later i upped my position averaging down with a single share but at $120.  Just days ago I sold off my FTEC at a minimal loss, it had been rising very slowly after tanking so it cost me about $3 to exit the position and land another GME share with the rest going bullish into VGAC. 

Cut to yesterday's big dipper event, by this time I was mentally prepared.  I had done tons of market research outside of reddit, I've read many DD post inside of reddit, and i realized the side the media was on and knew they were begging us to let them be.  So just seconds after my buddy holding bags at a 300+average messages me and says we came back for him boom.  In my timezone we're talking 11:45am.

""They"" is the problem with this thinking.


There are Hedge Funds playing GME from every which-way. There are probably more Long (""our side"") than Short at this point. We are riding the waves generated by their battle.


MAYBE the entity that dropped that massive short-bomb today thinks momentum will burn out fast enough that it'll be able to pick up the scraps or at least break even on the amount they owe.

MAYBE they drove the price down to buy a fuckton of calls for the eventual gamma.

970,GME," But it isn't one hedgie. Lots of different hedgies with different agendas. Apes can do what they want but buy and hold for the squeeze is not stupid either.

The short today was a low liquidity environment. Very clearly many/most MMs pulled their bids and the sellers went in. Show me another day where you have this level of price action on that small of volume? Usually 400,000 share candles will max out around $8-$9. During the short? $40+

Note that they tried hard on the short side:

1. when trading resumed after the halts both the bids and the offers were significantly below the halt, which is abnormal.
2. there were millions being thrown on the asks during the run up

If you calculate out the volume from during the drop and after, you'll find that the buy volume is much much larger than the sell volume - almost 3X.

Lastly, the open interest on calls for this week and next are huge. So many, in fact, that were GME to close above them all there aren't enough shares of GME in existence to fill those options. Forget the MOASS, this would be the MOAGS. So the MMs had to get the price down too.

Great DD.

Few questions for curious apes:

1. it needs to slowly run up to $772 per share so it can increase by 300% to get to $2314 and be a sustainable launch pad to $69420: did you get these numbers by backtracking from 69420? how did you get $772 and $2314?
2. The chart played out perfectly with the 3rd daily candle now sitting around the $260 area. The only difference is the chart has a **retarded doji** instead of a normal candlestick. This retarded doji now makes me think the squeeze potential is much higher & close to happening.  
pls explain significance of retarded doji- or even explain retarded doji to retarded ape.
3. This is why hedge funds are truly FUCKED because this was their only opportunity to try & trigger a sell-off to cover at a low price and they could only get it down to $180 :  
I suspect hedgies have more tricks up their sleeves- but certainly, they have not met HODLERS and do not know what to do- becoming very apparent.
4. **If you see another sharp drop again due to a short attack it is nothing to fear, I am only talking about how GME needs a steady uprise, it doesn't matter if it has sharp dips, they only make it easier for the stock to rise quicker.** : what is making it rise up so quick- before it took a lot longer- is it the high IV?
5. Can you throw some numbers on the 1st chart- because I reviewed your predictions and they are very accurate. Care to throw some more predictions so far as the where and when you predict the next dip. I had to get a new set of pants when it dipped today but i

1046,GME," It really is a psychological game, they are really trying to make us think that it’s a bad thing to buy this stock, regardless of what they’ve done.

I personally bought GME back in November because I believed the stock price would go up due to the PS5 launch so I bought it for $11 and when I saw that there was not enough stock for PS5 sales at the time, it made me sell for about a 10% gain at $12. Only recently I bought back in at $209 when I saw news about an e-commerce expansion, I genuinely see it as an attractive investment regardless of the short squeeze, so what wrong with that? They make it seem like it’s manipulation when loads of people buy a stock, which is absolute bs. But shorting a stock over 100% to artificially lower a price to try and bankrupt a company isn’t manipulation at all? It’s more than just manipulation actually, and when you realise the true nature of what they have done it makes you really want the short squeeze to happen for the good of the market & companies. It just makes it more of an attractive investment

Edit: I agree, I think they will try and artificially fake small squeezes to shake out paper hands, but we all know the heights this can go to. A $100 drop when the price is at $10000 per share is only a 1% decrease, it only seems like a big drop now since the price is only $260",Jasbeats,60,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m2b59r/gme_technical_analysis_from_a_retard_part_3_why_i/gqijr9c/,0.086,0.838,0.076,-0.3824

1155,GME," Very important: guys dont spend too much time on reddit and megathreads. 

Why? These threads can be very manipulating. 
I often find myself picking up the general consens of these threads. This goes up and down. Very often I have a good feeling about something then I go into this thread read tons of negative comments and immediately feel like okay I better should not do this and that. So, i am a retarded idiot and of course you would think lol who cares about what they write here, many people do, they sort by new and read every comment and get too emotionally invested in this. 

Even now, people here talk like GME is dead after a heavy attack from which it recovered after like 20 minutes. While I thought before ""wow we are on the same level after yesterday"" I read some discussion threads and immediately feel like I missed the chance of my life and regret my decisions. 

Tl;dr: trust your gut or good dds but dont trade dependend on comments in megathreads.",terektus,63,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m2not4/daily_discussion_thread_for_march_11_2021/gqkhvp1/,0.092,0.761,0.146,0.624
1156,BIG," For those new to whats happening:

70mil shares exist, 20 mil shares are institutional and untradeable. that 50mil left over (excluding naked shorts) is what is being fought over by the big guys.

The Short side is attacking the stock in a relatively smart way, getting it on the short restricted  list today rather than friday. If they can kill enough confidence, and fight a wall price at whatever undisclosed price they need it to stay below, friday when the Short Restriction is lifted they can attack even harder to shore up losses on options contracts for 3/12

What were are seeing is no doubt sell offs by BIG BIG money to crash price and recoup from the options market contracts. NOT HUGE RETAIL SELL OFF. We could never have this huge of an effect as what we are seeing today and and saw yesterday. were just smack dab in the middle of a battle between big boys with unfathomable money.

The upside is the Long Big Money is also likely waiting to see how much the short side is willing to let loose so they can buy it up. but timing is everything atm. that is why shorts were happy to see highs wednesday and no doubt planned for this to crash it wednesday. But, there is still many more moves to be made on both sides

This was a cold war. Its now a hot one. Defcon 5 friends

1366,GME," >How many stocks do we have as collectives?

There are estimates, but no way to really know. We do know that most of the GME stock is owned by people that can't easily sell. CEO/Gamestop of course owns a controlling interest. Large funds as well.

>How can we know that they'll have to eventually buy from us at our own set prices?

There are a few things that can force them to buy immediately. GME could call a shareholder meeting(which they will have to do when they hire their new CFO) or the clearing house could say ""No, fuck you. We're not holding the short anymore. Give us our stock, or we're not clearing any more trades for you.""

If that happens, the buying will be immediate, and fucking quick.


>Can't they find the stocks somewhere else and slowly cover (still losing a bunch of money) preventing the short squeeze?

They could, and probably have to some extent. The problem is that the easiest way to lower the price, is to short more stock. And that's what they've been doing. They've already shorted more GME stock than can be purchased on the market. Shorting more only digs the hole deeper. And, they are still on a time limit. They no longer have months and months. They likely have weeks at best to cover.",Klldarkness,26,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m2ts4q/explaining_it_like_youre_in_second_grade/gql75pg/,0.099,0.836,0.066,-0.7347

Trigger a massive sell off. Shit its probably just a couple funds trading between themselves at lower and lower rates.

Seeing the rapid bounce back just indicates how many people didn't paperhand and how institutions and individuals see the dip as a buy opportunity.

I’m Mexican and a friend of my invited me in December to a video call from a law firm in the US that deals with the whole NAFTA agreement and they were explaining to other law firms how to prepare their clients to the legalization of weed in Mexico. (It was supposed to happened back in December but they postponed)

So, big companies have already the eyes on Mexico to produce, process (not sure I’m using the correct word here), distribute and sell weed. 

Specially to Canada. 

it’s worth to note that Mexican internal consumption market has seen a HUGE increase on cannabis. Most of new generations are in favor of it and consume it. 

Also, drug cartels have been switching to other drugs (cocaine specially) it’s worth more and require less storage space, so it’s more redituable. 

Since some parts of the US started to legalize the weed and Canada, cartels have stopped or diminish the production and distribution, they have already adapted to this transition.

With that said, AMC converted $600M in debt to 44.4M shares on January 28th, the day after it squeezed up to ~$20 after being sub $5 all year. The following day, shares fell over 50% on news of the dilution, which killed the squeeze and hurt the shareholders who were bidding up the price.

The bonuses were announced February 28th and the CEO’s bonus was actually $3.75M.

1723,GME," 5% gain per day is unrealistic in a linear fashion like that (for 100 days, too many variables, news, social, interest rates, gov't moves, unemployment #'s, upcoming earnings report, expiring options etc). My point is your most likely looking at a drop to a certain resistance level. As of now technically that is around $200. When earnings come out on 3/23 after the market closes (it will begin moves up or down). My guess EPS will show negative for sure, but the driver will be +/-  for the analysts projected EPS and revenues. If either beats the analysts=moon time again, also betting Cohen posts on social before of after that will move this again.

Stock market or stocks, you can have a 1,000% gain but, it is usually measured over certain periods of time blocks (look at GME first run up, if you didn't exit in the green, it didn't matter you lost, till the 2nd run but, again you could still be a loser if you bought above the most recent high in the 1st run). That is the nature of the market, if you are a hodl mentality your betting long term, which could net big gains.

Also this is just already little over two months. I'll agree, after January I had consigned to buy down my CB. Dropped 252 CB down to 120 CB and then it spiked to 180. I went from fucking up my free funds entry to the market, to making a little scratch from it. I just got back in at the dip @ 1 for 175, cuz the other funds are tied up. It'll dip again though.

1729,GME," I don't really buy that argument, mainly because Blackrock isn't a single entity. If GME goes to 0 that's some VPs bonus out the door and possibly their job as well. Blackrock as a company may not care about losing a billion dollars in the drop today, but the fund manager who's bonus is based on performance sure as shit does. That being said, let's ignore all that though and just say we'll agree to disagree on whether Blackrock cares about losing that money. 

There are 10+ hedge funds that all have about a 5% or more stake in GameStop. Maverick Capital owns about 7% and controlls 15b in assets, Senvest owns 7% and has 3b assets under management.

Yeah that's what makes this so much more risky. Your stock depends on other people believe in short squeeze. Short interest burrowing fee is low and short interest is low based on public numbers during the run up (GME got shorted at a much much much much much lower price greater than the float). This time it looks more stable because it rose slowly right? But it's more dangerous as it rose due to people buying moreso than people shorting and covering. As to when you don't know. But if the huge instantaneous drop from someone selling a large order doesn't doesn't scare you I don't know what would.

This article was posted about 20 mins before the stock dropped. so how did they know? they went on to delete the article and repost it again at 12:43. i guess they realized soon after they fucked up and didn’t time it right.
