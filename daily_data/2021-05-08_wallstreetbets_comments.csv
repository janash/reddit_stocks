71,GME," I  think the basic fallacy that most make regarding GME short interest is assuming the cost basis of their shorts. Professionals move in and out  of short positions regularly, sometimes several times per day, if a stock has adequate movement. And they set stop losses.

A lot of the current short interest for GME was opened up north of $200 for example and they are sitting in a bowl of gravy right now. It's true in Jan a few sucker hedge funds got trapped by the low volume and couldn't get out but the short interest ratio is like half a day now. It's almost impossible for them to get trapped in a bad position.

There  is a lot of money to be made in GME trading just understand what the opposition is actually doing. They are not the static meme retards you expect. They are entirely different retards. :)",terrybmw335,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n79b4r/gme_amc_v_poor_ken/gxebn6x/,0.113,0.772,0.115,0.0633

At first it just looked like a community effort to save our beloved GME. Then I heard about the short squeeze and how robinhood stopped users from buying. It looked like the dirtiest trick I'd ever seen. It started plummeting and I thought it was over.

Then ya'll held at $50. And kept holding. I thought it would never rise again.

Then $350 came, the SEC committee met, and the links between Hedge Funds and Brokers had a spotlight.

For starters, if you don't count the cash infusion from their recent IPO, they actually have *fewer* assets in Q4 2020 than they did in Q4 2019.

They also made a loss -- a **bigger** loss in Q4 2020 compared to 2019 --at a time when home-buying is going *nuts*. The loss was 0.12c per share. *How* would that equate to being able to pay a dividend of $13 per share?

Finally, they have 425m in assets. If they could have paid a dividend of $13 per share, that money doesn't simply fucking disappear. It would be in their books as cash, or used to purchase assets, which would also be reflected in the books.

So, let's reflect:

* They only have 425m in assets

* That 425m was cash raised from a SPAC IPO

* They actually made a loss during the hottest home-buying market I've ever been alive for

* People on the Internet are lying about their fundamentals

2020 FY actual: $1.53 EPS also confirmed by UWMC investor relations.

333,AMC," Other theater chains did a much better job before and during Covid.  AMC has long leases on their theater locations instead of owning them, leaving huge liabilities to maintain in underperforming/unprofitable locations.  They took a long time, to figure out private theater rentals to bring in some income in areas that allowed it.  By me the AMC theaters stayed shut, when the Marcus cinemas opened for private party rentals, so a family could rent the whole place out for 100-200 bucks depending on day and movie.  Plus Marcus theaters here have beer on tap, and burgers that are fresh cooked and brought to you.  Renting out a whole theater for my family and out next door neighbors that we isolated with  was less expensive per person than pre pandemic and didn't have to deal with anyone we didn't know.  AMC by us has the same crap popcorn, candy, soda options it always has and took an extra 9 months to figure out that making some money is better Than nothing.",AcanthocephalaOk1042,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n7ahq5/uwmc_dont_be_fooled_my_friends/gxcc9ap/,0.038,0.888,0.074,0.7506

335,AMC," Yep, all i heard was horror stories from people trying to book a 'private' AMC movie, even recently. They couldn't even get out of their own way enough to rent entire fucking theatres for 150 bucks.

Theres also zero innovation or special thing about a movie theatre lately. Their biggest tech advancement in 20 years was being able to buy tickets and choose seats electronically. Even then it took them WAY to long to figure that out and they needed outside help like FANDANGO or whatever.

As the bubble started to burst, I put all my money in ""safe"" profitable tech stocks (Cisco, Oracle, Network Solutions and Intel). A month later the bottom fell out. It was a roller coaster ride, with enough ups to make you think it was coming back. My ""safe"" stocks lost a bundle. I rode two companies into the ground, and lost 90% on others. 

Today, Cisco and Oracle are worth less than they were 21 years ago. Despite consistent earnings increases, they never grew into those valuations.

We are obviously on the tail end of covid now in the US, and the roads are packed and people are eating out, but in my area there are vacant buildings left and right, companies and restaurants that pulled the plug and aren't coming back.

That means a lot of RNG.  Some electricity too, but RNG is going to get a huge chunk of that if that bill passes.  And it looks pretty clean when talking about pork.

460,AAPL," @u/Nrdrage I follow your picks for ideas. First one I shadowed you on was $ISRG. No hard feelings BTW. Anyhow:

BABA - 9/17 270C and 10/15 280C. Both down about 19% at the moment but this is a longer play so we'll see how it pays out. Not worried at the moment as I've seen red and green over the time I've held it.

AAPL - Totally forgot this was on your list but went long after the earning dip at $127 and sold a 6/18 120/125P credit spread. I think the long should be a good entry and I plan on doing the r/thetagang 50% profit move on the spread if this thing flatlines.

BB - I'm holding bags since January but it's a small portion of my portfolio so I'm going to pretend like it doesn't exist and check on it in  2023 or whenever we have flying cars.

CLOV - Couple weeks ago got in on a Thursday at 8 with a few thousand shares and got out the following Monday morning at 11 then watched it fall back to 9 that afternoon. Made me feel like a genius. Pure luck though.

PINS - got in long on an earnings play expecting a beat. Got beat by the fucking CEO saying sales were pulled forward. What a dick.

Keep it up brother! Also, love the snark as much as the picks.

Edit: just read your comments on GS in this post and remembered what you said previously (lol). I looked at the history and agreed with the DD but had a bad feeling considering the market currently defies the laws of physics and I feel like the calendar is off by a month or so.

PLTR / CLNE were my first try at options and while I knew there was volatility, i didn't realize it would be this crazy... i'm not sure if it's my broker (not in US), but whenever I set limit sells of my options, it could never sell for what I want, even though as I refresh last sell prices, I keep seeing the last prices that meet or exceed my limit... in the end i just sold at market. 

Being burned so bad at my first hand at options, might slow down a bit while I watch for entry with the BABA calls... maybe go for lower strikes to be safe. i definitely also don't have the same ability to be as agile with the scalping.... plus my broker has insane fees for options (almost $10 per option trade + $1 per contract)

CLNE bought shares at 11.18... doubled down at 9.8... was about to double down again at 8.9 but missed the bell... currently down 16%

CLNE June calls... down 75%... still a long way from June and thought about doubling down with June calls today since they were <$0.20 or perhaps at a lower strike.. but didn't execute.. hope i don't regret come monday

496,CAT," Just started following you this last week.  I was doing great last week and then got kicked in the teeth on Shop, Zm, Amzn etc.  Down about 23%.

Added some Clne positions will add more next week if it looks like it has found a bottom but down 50% on Sept $12s.

Jumped into Pltr $22C for May 14th and 21st.  Bleeding.  I should have put stoplosses on it but thought it would go up more the next day.  Saw the exit at about 15% gain but let it ride next day. Lesson learned, always stoploss to secure profit, minimize loss. Hoping for a solid Monday or I will have to cut losses.

Already been in Baba for a while running PMCC, going to expand position and be careful of how far otm the CC are in case it runs.

Same with Aapl.

545,SF," So, for me, when I'm looking at a stock, the first thing I look at is the story.  I want to invest in companies that I think are game changers (or, as some say, ""innovators"", or as SF hipsters say, ""disruptors"").  I want organizations that are doing something that nobody (or almost nobody) else is doing.   This is why I key into outlier companies in a sector like $NVTA, $CLNE, $BE, etc.   And I want to believe that they can execute that vision.  Which is why I don't fuck with companies like $QS or $FCEL or $NKLA, because I don't think they can ever actually make something.  Or at the very least, I want a company who's story has a lot of tailwinds.  I want to make sure the company is focused on being a company, not virtue signaling social causes that are just distractions.  This is also where I decide if the market agrees with me.  It doesn't matter if I'm right, if the market disagrees with me, the market is right where it counts (money).

&#x200B;

The second thing I do is look at Travelcenters of America.  I start with a daily and expand it out 6 months (used to be a year, but Covid Wall Street isn't useful data), then I go to a 10 minute chart, and I re-chart.  Then I take it down to a 4 and break it into segments.  Finally, I break 2 weeks down into 2 minute charts to confirm.

&#x200B;

THEN I look at the fundamentals.  I don't pay a lot of attention to traditional things like PE ratios, I don't go digging for ""catalysts"" or ""reasons"" why a stock increased in price.  Nobody ever looks for a reason why something dropped, so it always pisses me off when they ask why it will go up after a drop.  I do want to see cash on hand.  I want to see what the debt looks like.  I do care about multiples to a point.   If sentiment is illogically insane ($TSLA) I'll overlook it even if I dislike the company, but if it's too high ($UPST) I'll key in on it as a short play, even if I like the company.  I want to see if they have a dilution problem or an activist investor fucking things up.  I want to see their institutional hold percentage.  I want to see their customer base.

&#x200B;

If they pass all that, then I go into my wildcard stuff t hat doesn't matter to most people.  For one, I have a strict ""no asshole"" policy.  For example, my VC was an early investor into $SQ and I made the decision to liquidate us out of that when the stock was all the way down in the 40's, even though I knew it was going to go much further, simply because Jack Dorsey was the 2nd most vile person I've met in executive management, and I wanted nothing to do with him.  This is also why I'll only ever short $TWTR.  I would never do business with or invest in any company associated with Vlad, or Chamath, etc.  Then I want to see what analysts are covering the company, and I want to make sure these people aren't especially problematic (part of $CLNE's problem is I overlooked that Pavel from RJ was covering them).

&#x200B;

From there it's just a question of studying the charts, looking at volume and order flows, trying to understand how the machines trade the equity and how they behave, etc.  This is very much an art form and not really something I can make a runbook for.  It's very intuitive.  All this is also why I'm so good at catching bottoms, say buy into pain, and completely disregard the adage about not trying to catch a falling knife.

547,AI," There are a number of things, in my opinion

&#x200B;

First, completely disregard ""investor concerns about bond yields"" or ""fears about rate hikes"".  Those are red herrings.  For one, investors don't give a shit about bond yields (and Millennials/zoomers are too young to know this, but back when I first started angel investing near the turn of the century, bond yields were over 6%.  Contrarians will point out multiples were a lot lower back then, but the two aren't handcuffed).  For another, JPOW has been very adamant about the rate scheduling.  Any talk otherwise is just FUD and attempting to create a narrative to mask an activity.

&#x200B;

Second, President Harris's sabre rattling about making cap gains taxes over half of your profits in a lot of states, doing away with the 1031 real estate loophole, increasing corporate taxes, etc. DO cause markets to flee growth and into value/divi stocks.  It doesn't matter that the odds of any of it happening are slim, beating that drum can shake a market.  But people decided that fucking with the market is better than mean Tweets, so here we are.

Third, and this is a big one, hedge funds are leveraged to the tits - they've gone full retard because the SEC has reverted back to a feckless, toothless oversight board that doesn't enforce anything.  Bill Hwang was not an anomaly  He's just the first notable one that had the right series of events come up to force liquidation.  IPM in Sweden had a similar leverage that went tits up, and Sunshine had a similar problem, but not a lot of assets so it wasn't notable.  And the way these hedge funds are ""hedging"" their extremely leveraged positions is to short the ever loving fuck out of the market to try and make money both directions.  Notice how all of this got really weird after Hwang made international news.  That's because hedge funds that are cheating right under the SEC's nose didn't want to suffer the same fate, so adopted the maximum pain strategy.

Third, and this is another big one, it's the lockdown and stimmies.  The K-shaped recovery is real.  A lot of people have a lot of extra powder laying around, and they've decided, by and large, to put it to work for them.  People got stimmies and immediately tossed it into their bullshit ""free"" trading app.  The markets have never had so many retail investors in it before.  Which means there have never been more suckers tossing money into the market that Wall Street quants and algo coders are told to take all the money from.  It took them a while to figure out how to deal with this massive influx of cash into the markets, and you saw them really on their heels for a coujple of months, but they've figured out the game now.  The system of checks and balances is completely off the rails right now.  It used to be, IB's and HF's would shear the retail investors in an effort to slowly bleed them where possible, but not slaughter them so that they can't be sheared ever again.  Now there are so many people in the markets that they've just turned the machines to kill mode without any regard for how much damage their greed is causing or how much wealth they're just literally destroying (it's not even a transfer of wealth, per se, a lot of this money is just consumed into thin air).  These HFT's have been programmed to find any gaps in liquidity anywhere in the market and exploit them for maximum gain without any regard for the damage they do to other investors or even the underlying company.  This is why you're seeing completely illogical price action and movement lately.  It's the equivalent to a Vegas casino reprogramming all their slot machines to pay out 15% under the Nevada laws on payout floors because nobody will stop them.  The unmitigated greed is completely unrivaled right now, because these banks know the field won't be full of easy to kill food forever and if they don't do the killing, their competition will.  This is why tech stocks rallied today.  President Harris comes out and says more stimmy is needed.  So ""rotate into growth"" again to make it look affordable, get the rubes to line up and put their money in high flying stocks, then pull the rug and take their money all over again because of ""fears of inflation"" or ""concerns about re-opening"" or whatever other bullshit reason they can come up with.

&#x200B;

The solution to this last one, of course, is to both require IB's and HF's to report their short positions daily much like Cathie sends out her mailers about what she bought and to also implement a tax on HFT's based on how many trades they perform to make it unprofitable to literally destroy value a fraction of a penny at a time, but of course nobody in Washington is talking about that because their overlords don't like it.  So, this is an actual casino, and the roulette wheel is rigged.  Either accept that or don't play.

&#x200B;

One good thing is, since the machines control the markets (it's not ""investors""), that means they're operating based on a program, and you can sometimes find patterns in those programs to exploit them.

548,EOD," There are a number of things, in my opinion

&#x200B;

First, completely disregard ""investor concerns about bond yields"" or ""fears about rate hikes"".  Those are red herrings.  For one, investors don't give a shit about bond yields (and Millennials/zoomers are too young to know this, but back when I first started angel investing near the turn of the century, bond yields were over 6%.  Contrarians will point out multiples were a lot lower back then, but the two aren't handcuffed).  For another, JPOW has been very adamant about the rate scheduling.  Any talk otherwise is just FUD and attempting to create a narrative to mask an activity.

&#x200B;

Second, President Harris's sabre rattling about making cap gains taxes over half of your profits in a lot of states, doing away with the 1031 real estate loophole, increasing corporate taxes, etc. DO cause markets to flee growth and into value/divi stocks.  It doesn't matter that the odds of any of it happening are slim, beating that drum can shake a market.  But people decided that fucking with the market is better than mean Tweets, so here we are.

Third, and this is a big one, hedge funds are leveraged to the tits - they've gone full retard because the SEC has reverted back to a feckless, toothless oversight board that doesn't enforce anything.  Bill Hwang was not an anomaly  He's just the first notable one that had the right series of events come up to force liquidation.  IPM in Sweden had a similar leverage that went tits up, and Sunshine had a similar problem, but not a lot of assets so it wasn't notable.  And the way these hedge funds are ""hedging"" their extremely leveraged positions is to short the ever loving fuck out of the market to try and make money both directions.  Notice how all of this got really weird after Hwang made international news.  That's because hedge funds that are cheating right under the SEC's nose didn't want to suffer the same fate, so adopted the maximum pain strategy.

Third, and this is another big one, it's the lockdown and stimmies.  The K-shaped recovery is real.  A lot of people have a lot of extra powder laying around, and they've decided, by and large, to put it to work for them.  People got stimmies and immediately tossed it into their bullshit ""free"" trading app.  The markets have never had so many retail investors in it before.  Which means there have never been more suckers tossing money into the market that Wall Street quants and algo coders are told to take all the money from.  It took them a while to figure out how to deal with this massive influx of cash into the markets, and you saw them really on their heels for a coujple of months, but they've figured out the game now.  The system of checks and balances is completely off the rails right now.  It used to be, IB's and HF's would shear the retail investors in an effort to slowly bleed them where possible, but not slaughter them so that they can't be sheared ever again.  Now there are so many people in the markets that they've just turned the machines to kill mode without any regard for how much damage their greed is causing or how much wealth they're just literally destroying (it's not even a transfer of wealth, per se, a lot of this money is just consumed into thin air).  These HFT's have been programmed to find any gaps in liquidity anywhere in the market and exploit them for maximum gain without any regard for the damage they do to other investors or even the underlying company.  This is why you're seeing completely illogical price action and movement lately.  It's the equivalent to a Vegas casino reprogramming all their slot machines to pay out 15% under the Nevada laws on payout floors because nobody will stop them.  The unmitigated greed is completely unrivaled right now, because these banks know the field won't be full of easy to kill food forever and if they don't do the killing, their competition will.  This is why tech stocks rallied today.  President Harris comes out and says more stimmy is needed.  So ""rotate into growth"" again to make it look affordable, get the rubes to line up and put their money in high flying stocks, then pull the rug and take their money all over again because of ""fears of inflation"" or ""concerns about re-opening"" or whatever other bullshit reason they can come up with.

&#x200B;

The solution to this last one, of course, is to both require IB's and HF's to report their short positions daily much like Cathie sends out her mailers about what she bought and to also implement a tax on HFT's based on how many trades they perform to make it unprofitable to literally destroy value a fraction of a penny at a time, but of course nobody in Washington is talking about that because their overlords don't like it.  So, this is an actual casino, and the roulette wheel is rigged.  Either accept that or don't play.

&#x200B;

One good thing is, since the machines control the markets (it's not ""investors""), that means they're operating based on a program, and you can sometimes find patterns in those programs to exploit them.  People keep asking me how it is I found out about the JPOW diversity $SPY trick...it's simple, machines that are leveraging AI and trained to key in on certain words operate according to their program, and a pattern was detectable if you had a keen eye to see how they were programmed.

I might get murdered for this comment but I thought MVIS was a game changer and real innovator in that sense with their products and was drawn in by the DD on the MVIS sub. I work in automotive so understand what kind of benifits their lidar will make to autonomous driving so it resonated with me. The thing I didn't really consider for myself was the overall picture of their finicials and other factors you've mentioned above.

Luckily I unwound the majority of my position on the way down from the last run up and got my original investment back. It could have been a very painful loss if I didn't see one of you comments about a car costing more than their profits 😂 I think that was the eye opening moment! 

Suppose what I'm trying to say is that if I had some of your other points in my original analysis and if I hadn't been so niave with it in the first place I could have avoided the risk of blowing up my account. Going forward those points will help with any future trades so thankyou for that. 

Having first hand experience of meeting some of the management of these companies must be so useful to see what the companies culture and motivators are like from the top down. I wouldn't have even considered looking at the type of analysists covering companies before investing too as a bad egg could spoil any analysis that comes out. 

I'm interested in who you think is above Jack Dorsey on that list of vile people in management. I can guarantee you knowing that my old team leader Emma from working in a bar at uni is at the top of my list isn't very helpful 😂

583,CLNE," I've averaged down to 68 cents per CLNE June 18 13C. I just haven't had the powder to put in. June 18's a little over a month out, but with the current price action, I've become more skeptical. There just haven't been any buyers (until close to AH yesterday). I know it was just last Monday, but holding during this price action makes me feel like one of the Gibbons expecting an increase on a stock that's already had its day. I know, completely different; 1.20 just feels like wishful thinking to me now that I've seen the call go to 0.18 lol. 

On another note, I made some puts on AAL, made 26%. Went in on TSLA puts around 687 (later than you, I'm not your wizard level) and got out at 671 and 668. Timed it bad, but made a profit nonetheless. 
Kicking myself for not getting in on UPST at 117, but with how down I am in CLNE right now, I'm trying to avoid trading on FOMO. 
Waited on entering BABA, got in at 226, only slightly red there, not concerned.

587,VC," The reason the dicks like Dorsey, Bezos, Andrew Wilson and Paul Ricci stick out so much is because most leaders are, at their core, generally square deal types.  Like, after about 20 names, I start having to really think about shady leaders I've worked with, but I can list good dudes all day long.

&#x200B;

My favorite types to work with are engineers who really have no business being in charge of a company, because engineers make terrible executives - but they're usually really honest.  Nir Zuk comes immediately to mind.  Just an absolutely brilliant mind and I was thrilled to be able to get early VC into $PANW, and part of that was because I knew he realized he was going to have to cede control of the company to somebody else if he wanted it to be successful.

648,MA," Huh? That's not really a reply to what I've said. You did the same with the guy above who articulates my point much better.

I think clover will go up in the mid/long term with the MA age and expansion plan, but it's got a long hangover effect of spacmania and the seek insurance thing is a valid concern. I also think that since gme everything has become a ""omg short interest"" fiasco with people buying stocks expecting a repeat. It ain't going to happen every again, risk adjustment across the board already occurred (look at the jump in clov to 17).



So in summary, it is about making bets, but not about parroting useless shite like you have done. Buy shares if you think it'll go up, average down it it tanks post earnings.

Somebody mentioned SKLZ and last time I lost shorting it bcs of Cathie buying 2m of it in a day.

Looking more into it since she's been adding very heavily over the past few days, like insanely heavy. Cathie's holdings as of last night.

SKLZ = 8.2M (ARKW) + 12.8M (ARKK) = 21M. Shares float = 149.42M. % of float = 14%. Short % float = 30.34%

Other comparison is TDOC = 4M (ARKG) + 1.8M (ARKW) + 8.5M (ARKK) =14.3M. Shares Float = 153M. % of float = 9.34%. Short % Float = 11%

Cathie's trying to short squeeze SKLZ or something. borrow fee is 4.6% so probably not yet.

Choppy week upcoming with lots of growth earnings so I'd like to wait for that upside confirmation before making a play. If Cathie keeps buying this week it might break the 17 mark easily. At 14% shares float ownership it might be the highest percentage wise of ark holdings I've ever seen.

747,GME," No, this is a misconception and a very common one around here. High short % essentially means that hedge funds think the stock is shit atm, or highly overvalued, and therefore bring it down by shorting it and selling it. In almost all instances, a heavily shorted stock will go to the crapper and you should usually not touch it. 

The thing is, and this is very important, and what people in WSB are obsessed with for some reason, is that a heavily shorted stock can cause what is known as a short squeeze when something unexpected happens. For example with GME, its was extremely shorted, so when it went up hedges had to cover and pushed up the price even higher, which triggered even more stop losses, pushing the stop price higher, triggering more stop losses, pushing the stock price higher, etc etc.. it’s a chain reaction. 

This only happens very, very, very rarely and only when some huge news come out (that’s why GME is not going to squeeze again, everything that ahd to be said has been said), and most of the time a heavily shorted stock will go down hard and fast. If you believe in its fundamentals (I’m bullish on SKLLZ, you can use this huge dips to build a position for the long term, but be wary that it will probably keep going down in the short term after you buy it). Only do it if you are in for the long run.",DantehSparda,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n7vuls/sklz_that_killz_ur_puts/gxf9265/,0.063,0.917,0.02,-0.7796

Azure SQL db is also a nightmare - it doesn't scale disk, which is a lot of workload for everything that isn't transactional.

OK so what about SQL on a VM like the old days?
Complicated as fuck licensing models for SQL on a VM mean that not even Microsoft can sort it out. We have like 100 SQL servers which should be like millions of dollars for Microsoft - but the servers change sizes often so how the fuck can we license them per core?! So we just did what any shop would do - reached out to Microsoft support and requested sales teams to look at our environment and quote us on what we need. This was followed by an official Microsoft audit where the auditors were so confused they just basically took a giant spreadsheet from us, looked at it, and said - yep everything seems in line here!

772,GME," This really should be more on r/investing or r/stocks ,  but I'll fire off my observations, as I tend to still be pretty risk averse as well though I'm less so after hanging around here now for a while.   A couple sayings come to mind that may help: 

""Scared money don't make money""  - not sure where I heard this, but to some degree it's true.  I bet Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Papa Musk, etc were all laughed at for their ideas at one point and time.  Even Deep fucking value got laughed at HERE when he shared his initial thoughts on GME.  

""🐂 make money, 🌈🐻 make money (sometimes- not often) , 🐷 get slaughtered ""  

Not sure how that really relates to being risk averse or not, but I'm kinda retarded (hence being here) 

That said, it's a lot going to a casino, except that your chances can vary a bit more since you have more control over your own destiny.  The safe advice is to predetermine how much money you're willing to lose, and use that for any risky investments and nothing more.   

This is Wallstreetbets though, so you should probably just take your life savings,  take out a payday loan using your car as collateral, cash advance on your credit card, convince your parents to borrow from their retirement (lol boomers) and dump all of that into close expiring calls on something like ICLN or whatever other meme stock is near the top here.

For me it's more about the mechanics of what needs to be done.  
1. Get some early investors  
2. Build Hype - Create demand  
3. When it goes 🔥that is when the initial Supply is sold and Outside paper becomes Inside paper.

829,CC," I've made a ton on covered calls (used to be way OTM, but then started doing 10-20% OTM).  
Now, the premiums aren't that great (relatively speaking) and the moonshot seems closer than ever.

The low IV right now is not worth losing out on the massive gains.  
Counter-intuitive right? Usually, one would sell CC when IV is low.

Right now I'm just going to hold and be happy with any missed premiums going forward.
