Also, I am sure op is betting on sp 500 movement. Big balls. And earnings since the September expiry.  Taking advantage of sub 100 IV is smart too. I am doing the same.  


Also August could be the end of this naked short business seeing as how the fork of the en eff tea is closing later this month and gme having all illegit shares bought back to close these positions (maybe)

RSI is super oversold. Bollinger band is being touched. Ya. Stock can only go up.

Edit: I'm getting a shit load of comment notifications on my phone, and it looks like they are being deleted. Not sure why.  Sorry if I can't answer your questions.  Also, I believe that the price being flat as a board after opening is because Big money is playing the same game as OP and hoping for a flat line on premiums before they buy options. That's just a sexual fantasy of mine, so take it with a grain of salt and a dab of lube. (Came back to say looks like I was right. They lowered the premiums just before eod, bought options, and began throwing the volatility around)

The only company that failed to make decisions that matter is here: BB. Went from a giant to a turd.  


The fact is that QNX is likely not going to survive the automotive industry. Consumers are demanding better integration w/ their smartphone with their cars over security. This has been the trend since the past decade.  This is something that $GOOG can provide and not $BB.  


The fact it's been almost a decade with QNX and auto manufacturers are looking at other OSes (Android Automotive & AGL) should be a sign for $BB unless they want another '08 repeat of the iOS and Android becoming dominant smartphone OSes.

This has nothing to do with what I wrote, not sure why you're including it.

>Slide 22, shows how much of a benefit they are to other drug companies, and how more of them will want to utilize their service to find better drug targets to save $

I said this in my initial post, 23andme have data that may prove to be useful to other companies in their clinical trials. 
""23andme is an interesting company with access to an amount of data that no other biopharma company has. This has its own intrinsic value and adds some validity to the company itself.""

>Their subscriptions are likely beyond what you have estimated as they expect to close out the year 2022 at over 700,000. slide 37 and slide 44

They can project whatever subscription numbers they like, until they can produce that number it's all speculation. The slides you linked me show a year ending # of subscriptions to be 100,000. It's August, 3/4 of the way through the year and I stated they had 75,000 subscribers. Grab your calculator, what is 3/4 of 100,000?

>They are only losing a slight amount of money on each kit sold, they make that money back on deals with other drug manufacturers and subscriptions. They will likely be profitable before they have an active drug on the market. gross margin expected to increase quite a bit. slide 44

Look at the same slide you told me to look at and notice how the revenue is decreasing as time goes on. 

>""They make the money back on deals with other drug manufacturers and subscriptions."" 

Please link me to where 23andme has their name associated with a drug on the market. Oh wait, they don't have one. I'm not saying they will not in the future, but at this present moment and for the foreseeable future they will not have any association with a drug that is creating revenue. This is why I said this is a 5+ year hold, they need to get their name on something in order to turn a profit.

>They have very little expenses and are lower after the pandemic. expect a drop in cost for employees (most companies are doing salary adjustments for remote employees) and lower facility costs.

From the DNA testing kits this is probably true, I'm not going to fact check it because I can't be bothered. 

This is a company that was collecting data and selling DNA testing kits that is now moving toward becoming a biopharma company. They will continue to sell these kits but have shown us that they are selling less and less of them as time goes on. They have a subscription service that is projected to have 100k subscribers generating $3m in revenue for the year of 2021 and have offered us speculation that it will increase. 

This is a speculative long term (5+ year) hold that probably will pay off. The premise of my original post was this company is a long term hold, there are no catalysts in the near future that will propel this stock to the $18 it hit when it was first announced.

This one's a little more abrupt and it could create a new floor level in the low-100s for a bit, but the thing people need to understand is that the key to keeping this going is volume, and day over day the volume is dropping since 3 days ago.

RSI is returning to the center channel from the top for a couple of days. During the first 3 days of the run, AMD was keeping volume up with NASDAQ and today is dipped into a relative downward volume trend compared to the index, meaning that attention is shifting from the stock. Institutions will sell as retail investors continue to buy on hopium.

I feel that hopium, I do... I wrote that TA 2 weeks ago that called for this run based on shape, dynamics, and momentum and I got exactly what I wanted and then some, and I want that run to continue, but the run started at around $85 and had a 20 point expected duration based on the pattern, which I think was driven forward through sentiment on earnings and that could extend it a bit, but by how much?

Watch the volume tomorrow... that's going to tell the tale. If it starts to drop, the price can't be supported, and there'll be a sell-off.  


Having said that, even if volume decreases by 5 or 10% tomorrow, it's still really high compared to prior benchmarks for AMD. The run likely still has some life left in it.",Moist_Lunch_5075,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/owrrbp/16k_amd_against_the_grain_yolo_puts/h7itro8/,0.027,0.929,0.045,0.5029

1101,CRSR," Okay. The intelligent gambler in me, and the moderate.

Intelligent Gambler:

1) UWMC--> Dividend yield of 5.3%. Low payout ratio that's safe. Doing buybacks. Selling covered calls at 5 cents a pop for a .67% monthly with a strike near 100% over will generate you 1$ on a 7.5 cost basis roughly. That's 13.33% Annum. Could get more easily by selling 10's, 11's, or 12 monthlies for 15-25 cents.

2) ViacomCBS with a dividend of over 2.5% can net you roughly 1.1% per month selling calls a month away with a strike that is roughly 17.5% past your cost basis. Low payout ratio.

Both can increase their dividends safely.

Moderate Gambler:

1) SOFI, seems to stop at roughly 15$, and it has a perennially high IV. Buy commons and sell OTM calls.

2) Alight calls for Feb 2021 have a cost basis below the SPAC value or did relatively recent. They're still good value. I personally am preferential to the 7.5's. These seem to me like safe calls to print, but i've been shook by CRSR. 

3) Puts on Lucid. Been thinking of writing some DD on it. This doesn't seem like such a moderate gamble considering the date of the lock-ups.

1140,TSLA," To OP, I don't think anyone doubts the future of EV's.  However, in term of investing, people have been buying into EV stocks for years and at some point, valuation will come into play.  

To keep it short, you have to choose the ones that will win.  My guess is that many of the recent EV SPAC's won't be around in a few years.  TSLA is obviously a leader, but it is very expensive and more so if you factored out the emission credits it sold every quarter.  It is a cult stock and valuation doesn't really matter at this point, but it may eventually become a factor.  And when it does, it'd better make a lot more profits to justify the stock valuation.

I'd stay away from any Chinese stocks with all the political uncertainties at this point.
