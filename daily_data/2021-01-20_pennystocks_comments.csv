On their form  424B5, when they listed the company website, they listed the website of a different company, one that has a similar sounding name to their own. (www.translogsys.com).  I suppose it could just be a typo by the new management.

Then I looked up the Doug Cerny guy whose the chief development officer.  He's never bothered to update his linkedin with the fact he works at TLSS, even though he's been there nearly 2 years.  I sort of want to send him a message and just see he responds.  I'm sort of wondering if they are just using his name and this guy has no idea.

I also find it odd that their CEO, John Mercadante Jr., has no online presence what so ever.  Like no photos, linkedin, or anything. I suppose he's older (76) so maybe he just doesn't use technology.

I have 81 thousands shares at .021 and still believe this company is gonna fly but many assumptions are being made about where this company stands as far as the omentum device. When it is FDA approved this is going to do gangbusters but who knows when that will be.

However, it is my understanding that the MedRecycler will not be open until end of April at the earliest once the final approval process is complete, and may not be until the summer/July timeframe. What's happening at the end of this month is the beginning of the final approval process, which is supposed to take a few months (mid-April) as they have to give the public time to respond to the intent to license this facility. However, it certainly doesn't seem like this is something a few people in the public who are against this will be enough to stop it from happening. The need is too great, and the people in power and office want this to happen. Shekarchi literally just won re-election in November.

9days ago 1/11 which was the beginning of this latest upward trend you said AITX isn‚Äôt going to pay out for a good while.  https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/kuh8o7/which_penny_stock_to_put_2500_on/gisiv8k/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3 Today it peaked at .0777 which going by your post‚Äôs would have been a 42% gain for you if you bought at the absolute high of .0546 which I think you did, but let‚Äôs say you bought at .04 like you said in this post https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/kniym9/any_stocks_can_be_discussed_on_this/ghn00r6/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3 that would be a 69% gain for you today if you sold at the top or you‚Äôre a short trying to encourage negative sentiment. 

So if you bought at the top I‚Äôd suggest ride it out a bit longer.  It‚Äôs no fun buying a stock at the top on FOMO and watching it dip, but you‚Äôve already seen between a 40-50% gain today. You should of sold at the top .0777  or you‚Äôre a short trying to encourage negative sentiment. Looking at 2 week 15min chart it‚Äôs already formed a really nice looking cup, and now into the handle portion. This is a pretty bullish signal. If you want out I‚Äôd at least watch that play out. If you‚Äôre a short, I understand you got to do you, but here‚Äôs some DD on cup and handle patterns: https://school.stockcharts.com/doku.php?id=chart_analysis:chart_patterns:cup_with_handle_continuation it might help you plan your exit better than your entry.

So the other day, I saw on this subreddit DD of a stock that was going to do well. I am learning about shorts so I am taking a small amount of money (because I am sure there is a big learning curve) but I bought 2000 shares of CLWD @ .10 a share with the plan to sell them around.12

Currently, I am down 12 percent on this trade, isn't and the way it's looking, It might continue to fall. My question isn't so much about the stock CLWD but rather when should I count my losses and move to the next one. Should I take the 12 percent loss, or hold out where I can get my money back. 12 percent loss on 150 bucks isnt too bad but I am practicing like I am playing with big money.

They are also pivoting to be a big player in vaccine rollout and the government is practically going to write a blank check to get that done here soon. On top of all this they only have a fraction of the total sites completed and are getting better and better at rolling them out.

Very poor financials; operating expenses 6.4x that of gross profit. Operating profit -125 thousand. 

Net income -154k.

Operating expense 10x that of gross profit. 

operating income -17.5 mil. 

total assets at 35 mil of which 25.5 mil is goodwill and intangible assets. there's lots of controversy around the value of goodwill/intangible asset.

461,EV,"Tesla is a well diversified company, they are not just an automotive business.  Tesla is a clean energy business, which includes clean energy vehicles.  Clean energy is the Biden administration‚Äôs top priority and Tesla is arguably one of the largest companies in the space.  Additionally, while other companies are just getting started with the EV trend, tesla has a 12 year head start on them.  Furthermore, tesla has the best autonomous technology system.  It is also worth noting that the Biden administration is focused on putting America, our factories, and our workers to work in minimizing outsourcing production in an effort to make our economy stronger and more self-sufficient.  With that said, while Biden is trying to make our relationship with China better, and make importation easier, he is also giving incentives to have electronic vehicles made in the United States and purchased by us.  So to say that Tesla is going to start feeling pain might be true however there are many, many things that differentiates them from their competitors.  You have to keep in mind that your statement says the Chinese EVs Will start feeling the pain because they have more competition among other Chinese EV‚Äòs.  Also, tesla has a larger vehicle lineup than the Chinese EVs And they have their truck and quads coming out this year.",0.034,0.771,0.194,0.9861

My first penny stock gamble was LTUM.  Last fall when tesla was going crazy I decided to gamble on a small amount on a lithium company cause of batteries and all that.  First US based company I found was LTUM.  Threw a little in with no DD (and no understanding of how to do DD).  But you probably could have thrown money into any lithium project last fall and made money right now. LTUM literally hasn't done anything, no news, no catalysts, nothing, but their stock has tripled from .15 to .45.  They can't even go up to their Canadian lands right now because they can't cross the border due to covid lol.",0.061,0.881,0.058,0.3974
