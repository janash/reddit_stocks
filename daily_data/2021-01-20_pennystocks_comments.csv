No country would be dumb enough to intentionally unleash a virus into the world that also kills their own people, let alone a virus that selectively targets old people in a country that is governed by old people (look at the average age of China’s political leaders).

Trump got into office then 4 years later China is more powerful than ever. He fucked up.

Biden and Obama were putting together international trade agreements that exclude China to contain China. That’s the right way to do it.

Also, look at Trump’s deal with an Indonesian golf course (financed by Chinese loans), his secret Chinese bank account, Ivanka’s trademarks, and Trump telling Xi he thought the concentration camps were the right idea (while he was asking China for help to manufacture bullshit on the Democrats to help him win the election).

17,USA,">	China is flourishing while all the other countries are withering to death. 

Because they took drastic measures very early. And people followed them. There was no anti-mask movement, no conspiracy movement, no Qanon insanity. People just did what they government told them to do, and they handled the virus situation very very well. 

After the lockdown, the government was swift in determining which sectors could reopen and how quickly. They helped companies from all over the spectrum switch to making PPE and medical devices, and instituted a whole new governmental organization to inspect and certify all PPE going abroad. These companies made a killing. For the last 10 months 90% of PPE and medical devices are coming out of China. They had first mover’s advantage. 

Could have been the USA, but our government was to lo focused on how each individual could be enriched and not what was best for the country. We had a lame duck president who was more worried about his image rather than helping the country. The covid response was completely bungled by our government, and we became a global laughingstock. China didn’t do any of that - we did. A decent president in charge, and a solid/unified response as we’d see growth as well. We have the industry and the means, we just lacked the direction and desire. That’s 100% on our government, and you passing the blame on China is lazy and, frankly, stupid as fuck. 

>	Isn’t that a success operation? 

It’s a cultural difference you just don’t seem to understand. In China the people trust their government and do as they’re told. In the west, most citizens do not and do however they feel. In the US, we have a whole host of people that think everything is a conspiracy because their normal lives are so insignificant or uneventful that this makes them feel like they have a place in the world.

On their form  424B5, when they listed the company website, they listed the website of a different company, one that has a similar sounding name to their own. (www.translogsys.com).  I suppose it could just be a typo by the new management.

Then I looked up the Doug Cerny guy whose the chief development officer.  He's never bothered to update his linkedin with the fact he works at TLSS, even though he's been there nearly 2 years.  I sort of want to send him a message and just see he responds.  I'm sort of wondering if they are just using his name and this guy has no idea.  Which would be hilarious if that was the case, because the dude is a lawyer who specializes in small businesses, trademarks, and IP protection.

I also find it odd that their CEO, John Mercadante Jr., has no online presence what so ever.  Like no photos, linkedin, or anything. I suppose he's older (76) so maybe he just doesn't use technology.

However, it is my understanding that the MedRecycler will not be open until end of April at the earliest once the final approval process is complete, and may not be until the summer/July timeframe. What's happening at the end of this month is the beginning of the final approval process, which is supposed to take a few months (mid-April) as they have to give the public time to respond to the intent to license this facility. However, it certainly doesn't seem like this is something a few people in the public who are against this will be enough to stop it from happening. The need is too great, and the people in power and office want this to happen. Shekarchi literally just won re-election in November.

So if you bought at the top I’d suggest ride it out a bit longer.  It’s no fun buying a stock at the top on FOMO and watching it dip, but you’ve already seen between a 40-50% gain today. You should of sold at the top .0777  or you’re a short trying to encourage negative sentiment. Looking at 2 week 15min chart it’s already formed a really nice looking cup, and now into the handle portion. This is a pretty bullish signal. If you want out I’d at least watch that play out. If you’re a short, I understand you got to do you, but here’s some DD on cup and handle patterns: https://school.stockcharts.com/doku.php?id=chart_analysis:chart_patterns:cup_with_handle_continuation it might help you plan your exit better than your entry.

I think that is your best post yet.😂 Easy setup sorry!

Since your in law school and all per your post 12days ago  https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kscxjp/soam_i_crazy_or_did_this_guy_prove_the_stock/gifgc1x/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3 I’d like to suggest you get your story straight for your prosecution. 

The defense rest’s your Honor.

P.S. On a side note though. I do have a lot of respect for the fact that you’re going through law school. That’s a very hard major, and had been a dream of mine at a point years ago.

Very poor financials; operating expenses 6.4x that of gross profit. Operating profit -125 thousand. 

Net income -154k.

operating income -17.5 mil. 

total assets at 35 mil of which 25.5 mil is goodwill and intangible assets. there's lots of controversy around the value of goodwill/intangible asset.

They are also pivoting to be a big player in vaccine rollout and the government is practically going to write a blank check to get that done here soon. On top of all this they only have a fraction of the total sites completed and are getting better and better at rolling them out.

466,EV,"Tesla is a well diversified company, they are not just an automotive business.  Tesla is a clean energy business, which includes clean energy vehicles.  Clean energy is the Biden administration’s top priority and Tesla is arguably one of the largest companies in the space.  Additionally, while other companies are just getting started with the EV trend, tesla has a 12 year head start on them.  Furthermore, tesla has the best autonomous technology system.  It is also worth noting that the Biden administration is focused on putting America, our factories, and our workers to work in minimizing outsourcing production in an effort to make our economy stronger and more self-sufficient.  With that said, while Biden is trying to make our relationship with China better, and make importation easier, he is also giving incentives to have electronic vehicles made in the United States and purchased by us.  So to say that Tesla is going to start feeling pain might be true however there are many, many things that differentiates them from their competitors.  You have to keep in mind that your statement says the Chinese EVs Will start feeling the pain because they have more competition among other Chinese EV‘s.  Also, tesla has a larger vehicle lineup than the Chinese EVs And they have their truck and quads coming out this year.",0.034,0.771,0.194,0.9861

489,RM,"Very tough to say with all the variables at play... BUT there are a lot of us thinking it will hit a penny by the court date. We just need some steady volume and much like today it will keep climbing.

If the shares get cancelled Im thinking we will see a pretty immediate jump due to the SP being a function of Market Cap vs Shares Outstanding. Someone correct me if I wrong here, but let's say for example- if half the shares are cancelled then we see a jump in price of x2 - similar to a reverse split but you keep all your shares.

Personally I'm thinking we hit .01 - .02 by the court date and then depending on what the outcome is we either go back down (bad outcome) or we immediately start rocket engines...

Also, depending on the RM after the court date I'm thinking this has potential to make some serious runs.

Of course this is all speculation, but we're all here for that possibility right?

My first penny stock gamble was LTUM.  Last fall when tesla was going crazy I decided to gamble on a small amount on a lithium company cause of batteries and all that.  First US based company I found was LTUM.  Threw a little in with no DD (and no understanding of how to do DD).  But you probably could have thrown money into any lithium project last fall and made money right now. LTUM literally hasn't done anything, no news, no catalysts, nothing, but their stock has tripled from .15 to .45.
