185,PE,"Stock offerings will usually lower the share price as more shares are being issued. Imagine a pool of money is represented by 10 shares, if you suddenly increase this to 20 shares, each share will represent less money. Naturally, market forces will drive the share price down when these shares are issued. Then if investors feel that the PE ratio is too low (from the current EPS) this will suggest it's undervalued and will buy more shares, thus the share price will increase. But tbh no one really knows if the share price will increase/decrease (especially for these types of companies where the operating income is decreasing).

What about Metamaterial:

1.They are making invisible antenna for EV, 5G communication

2.They are developing a new solar cell, much more efficient (partnering with Lockheed I think).

3.They are making anti-fog glass, which can be used for Aerospace, or cars

4.They are making glass material for Augmented Reality.

5. New 52,000 sq ft facility.

6.Medical: they are doing a similar thing to NNOX. The medical device can get the glucose reading by capturing light, no need to punch bloody hold on your finger.

7. Maybe does not mean shit to somebody, but they have a lot of patents and many leadership positions have Ph.D. from well-known university (Caltech, USC, Queen's University, Loughborough University of Technology). These people have a strong connection in the industry.

Just for your info:

1.Quantumscape (QS) has a market cap at \~20B, used to be more than \~40B. QS has the same kind of strong technical leadership,  their research is the solid-state battery, **but the product will not be available until another 4-5 years.**

2.MVIS's cap is currently at \~1.0B. MVIS is still looking for industrial connections. Metamaterial already has many strong partnerships in electronics and aerospace.

3.Metamarial is currently at \~100M, and metamaterial's production is scaling up now.

224,ZOM,"Metamaterials wants to be listed which is why they are merging with $TRCH. If they were not merging, you would be right about everything you just mentioned. I am betting on future technology in 6 different sectors. After hearing pump/dump stock I exited FRSX/MVIS/UAVS/BLNK/IZEA/ZOM/MARA/RIOT/MOGO and literally many others when they were under 1$, they are all up 500% now. This time I have done my research and I am going long based on what metamaterials is working on and have worked on being a disruptive technology with major partners. Again it is entirely up to you if you want to invest or not. This is just free research.",0.022,0.935,0.043,0.3182

418,ATH,"> transmission is going down

From the ATH, yes. But we've seen this numerous times before a new ATH is reached. We aren't vaccinating people quickly enough to prevent reaching new highs again. To put it into perspective, we shutdown in March when we were hitting ~20,000 cases per day. We're currently hitting ~200,000 cases per day from a high of ~250,000 cases per day.

I'm playing devils advocate here, as I obviously hope that once the new administration is in charge, they'll start speeding up the vaccinations to a point where it could have a significant impact on the spread. But the current pace is said to have a timeline of 10 years before everyone who needs a vaccine, gets one. So you're banking on the new admin increasing distribution by an extremely significant amount to have everyone good to go over the next few months.

Not an expert, but surprised the company is going back to do more preclinical work.  They  need to spend $$ on human trials to meet the first part of the above criteria (As effective or safe).

I work for a company that sells and supports analyzers for vet clinics. ZOM will need to be spending like crazy to create a name for themselves in this market. Customers usually stick with the companies they are familiar with because such a large investment is not usually worth the return. First they have to have cash to purchase it, train their team and provide on going maintenance and buy cartridges/reagents to keep their machine running  - all of this on something that hasn’t been around (gamble). The best selling point in this industry is another customer’s reference on how well the analyzer performs - ZOM is new and doesn’t have this which is a huge disadvantage. Customers will usually 9/10 times pick a name they can trust. 

With all of this I still purchased ZOM, knowing it’s a long shot. Knowing they need to make good decisions on their production, sales and marketing teams.

So unique and special industry and with an increasing number of animals being cared for all AROUND THE WORLD, the product is be so sellable and affordable that every pet owner might just have those medical device. 

Also to add on, its CEO has bring many small companies in the past to allow companies stock price to become penny stock into $10+. 

Read more of my posts and others, u will 100% realise that ZOmedica will not only rise so high up, it may even become so high that it can emerge as the leader in its industry.

btw IDEXX is the lead in pet tech medical industry with stock price around $500.",0.0,0.892,0.108,0.9536

567,ZOM,"I think the USP is obvious.

For a vet to test for the various conditions would require multiple bulky machines from IDEXX in the clinic, which is impractical for alot of clinics. Whereas with TRUFORMA it is one single machine that will have the capability to test for multiple disease conditions in parallel and furthermore ZOM will expand the list of conditions that can be tested using TRUFORMA with further assay development and validation.

I will tell you now, if their reps came to our clinic and showed is promising results, a good price, and the ability to take the place of a couple different machines, we would have given serious consideration.

Or would you buy 1 single machine to test various conditions with a pipeline of assays in development for this machine to expand testing for additional disease conditions. This is much more cost effective, and saves space and potentially even the smallest of clinic can use this.

Additionally, while other companies are just getting started with the EV trend, tesla has a 12 year head start on them.  Furthermore, tesla has the best autonomous technology system.  It is also worth noting that the Biden administration is focused on putting America, our factories, and our workers to work in minimizing outsourcing production in an effort to make our economy stronger and more self-sufficient.  With that said, while Biden is trying to make our relationship with China better, and make importation easier, he is also giving incentives to have electronic vehicles made in the United States and purchased by us.  So to say that Tesla is going to start feeling pain might be true however there are many, many things that differentiates them from their competitors.
