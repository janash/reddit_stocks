42,OR," First - I am agnostic on your beloved stock.  I could care less because I’m not involved, if anything I do enjoy seeing retail succeed.

Second - what you just described is nonsense.  Have you ever even written out a crazy ass trade structure like that on paper?  Let’s use some round numbers to consider it:

$100 short ETF = $1.58 short Game Stonk
$98.42 invested to “offset”.  That gives us an effective short of .79% (less than 1%) per dollar. 

So now for every $198.42 invested I am short $1.58 Game.  So even if I was correct and I had a $200M gross short profit on using this batshit idea my net would be $3.15M (assuming zero fees OR borrowing costs which is also La La land crazy).  So I can lock up $200M for a $3.16M gain?  Or and hear me out now - $200M in 3 months treasuries at ~4.5% = $9M RISK FREE.

Why in the hell wouldn’t I just short the underlying?  As of Friday according to Fintel there are 1M shares available to short.

Some of the stuff you guys talk about - for example more shares being short than exist in the float - I can more easily believe happening.

Hell maybe someone does use a basket of stocks to short Game Stonk but I am 99% they aren’t using XRT.

I'm sure there are better places to look for this info, though I'm more of a macro investor in the physical metal, so please bear with my limited options knowledge.

Based on the above link, it looks like highest open interest is on the 5/19 monthly with a put/call OI ratio of 0.2. The following monthly is 0.59 & the preceding month is 0.72 on 4/21. The weekly expiring next week is 0.71. Highest OI for 5/19 is strike of $195. Highest OI for next week's option is strike of $185.

The timing of this higher OI seems to correlate with the debt limit increase/when the federal gov is expected to run out of funds if the limit is not increased.

Since they really aren't in the cell phone game anymore these patients aren't really useful...not because they actually patent some useful technology that they could get royalties from...but rather they are used as ammo in litigation from other companies.

106,FRC," I think you made a very good point indeed!  


As a retail investor, I have no inside information regarding to any companies. So here's my take on the possibility of GS swallowing FRC:

&#x200B;

I think GS is too busy dealing with its own problems, like the 1MDB scandal, the Archegos fiasco, and the SEC investigations. FRC is a well-run bank with a strong balance sheet and a loyal customer base. It doesn't need to sell itself to anyone, especially not to a greedy Wall Street giant like GS. 

&#x200B;

Besides, I don't think FRC would fit well with GS's culture. FRC is known for its community banking and wealth management services, while GS is known for its investment banking and trading activities. FRC is like a friendly neighbor who helps you with your finances, while GS is like a shark who wants to eat you alive. No offense to sharks.

&#x200B;

So in conclusion, I'd say it is very unlikely for GS or other big banks to swallow FRC, unless under catastrophic stress, and so far I did not see that happening in the near future.

108,CS," GS might not be the most likely, but they’ve spent six years(?) building up their Marcus consumer banking division in the interest of diversification. I bet they have spent more than the current market cap of FRC to do so, and achieved far less than swallowing FRC would yield them. I think the clientele of First Republic would be giddy to have a top class investment bank advising the wealth management division. Most large Wall Street investment banks have a retail banking division. 

You do know that FRC has retained the services of several advisors about potentially selling to another bank, issuing new shares, etc? They could end like SVB, they could end like CS. Both scenarios represent major risk to the value of common shares.

You know FRC is potentially facing several major lawsuits for potential misleading investors about the deposit flight and other statements that the executive management made during the collapse of SVB?

113,PLUS," Lowering rates PLUS turning Fed printer back on equals more billions for billionaires, higher inflation, higher housing costs, higher rents and risk free passive income for owners, and further contraction of the middle class. The best way to combat inflation while sparing the middle class and poor is to more aggressively do Quantitative Tightening but QE padded the bank accounts of billionaires doubling their wealth and they don’t want that. Also banks have completely and recklessly mismanaged risk again and with out more Fed QE the banking system could have collapsed. The Fed should have used QT as the primary tool to lower inflation as it would have taken trillions of QE out of the money supply. Too much money floating around was a big driver of inflation and asset bubbles including housing which has become unaffordable for younger middle class families in many part of the US and throughout the western world.  QT should have been the primary lever used to lower inflation while increasing interest rates at a much slower rate.  But instead the Fed took a hammer to the debtor class (the middle class and poors) while barely mentioning QT and barely made a dent in the Fed balance sheet before having to undo most of that again bailing out the banks.",Eastern_Ad_4441,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/122cs83/starwood_capital_ceo_barry_sternlicht_warns_of/jdr8ocb/,0.08,0.784,0.137,0.9587

""*My Walmart plan did not work last time so I have taken a break to rethink my strategy and have come back with a plan.

Do Diligence: Shorting SNAP, Projected profit: ~ $3 per share

Reasoning: - Snapchat is out, Tik tok is in. Nobody uses Snapchat to communicate anymore. All my friends send videos of Tik tok to me through my phone. - Snapchat lacks features. I am bored of the features snapchat provides. They need to innovate or be left behind. - Snapchat has too many boys. Everytime I open Snapchat I look at my quick add and it’s always bots. So many boys and it’s getting distracting. - Technical Analysis: everyone thinks snapchat is stable but it’s not actually. The stock price is not going up which means people don’t trust the company.
