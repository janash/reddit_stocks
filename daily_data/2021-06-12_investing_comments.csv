26,MLM," Most people are sleeping on this merger and once they realize it’s not a true MLM and BODY has huge growth potential it will blow up. A company that has been profitable for 22 years off workout DVDs and made 1 billion last year with 400M to spend from the merger is only getting started. 

People will continue to work out at home in addition to going back to the gym. Their new live interactive BODi workouts coming out in August or September will even further drive up the share price. People have accepted that they don’t need to got to work anymore with Zoom and Teams and can do it all at home. Soon they will accept that they don’t need to be at a gym anymore to get the same results and experience. 

I see this as not only a competitor to Peloton but something much more in the coming years with their original fitness content they produce and a more affordable MYX bike. 

Put that together with a great CEO and key investors and management team such as Kevin Mayer, who was CEO of TikToK and helped build Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+. I think you have a 10 bagger in less than a year.

32,BB," > In fact, employees and coaches are not allowed to have products on hand (shakeology) which is typical of a true MLM.

that is by far not the most typical trait of an MLM. it is the recruiting and commissions through your downline that makes it an MLM. not to mention that the hundreds of thousands of coaches they have are NON SALARIED. they earn only from commissions through their recruitments and through direct sales. not having to carry actual stock has nothing to do with it being an MLM or not.

>While it is true that BB coaches are incentivized to bring on other coaches and sell Shakeology, it is not mandatory. 

if by ""incentivized"" you mean ""predatory tactics to ramp up recruitments at any cost"", and by ""not mandatory"" you mean ""absolutely mandatory"". then sure.

47,MLP," Financial advisor here. ~~No K-1s if you hold them in an IRA~~ (see edit for clarity - leaving for posterity). But part of the benefit of utilizing an MLP is for taxes, and that's null with an IRA. Essentially, don't use them if you don't know what you're doing and don't have a good CPA (who you speak with ahead of time). If all you're looking for are returns and yield, there are far simpler instruments out there. And no, this isn't advice, just high level education.

Edit: As mentioned by other commenters, I want to correct myself to note that you CAN receive a K-1 from an IRA, in specific circumstances. But once again, it's somewhat pointless to do so due to the overlapping tax benefit issue, so I never actually have any clients who receive one.

48,MLP," From my understanding that is correct ; if holding an MLP inside an IRA you really do not need to report or file anything unless the UBI is over 1k.

However most people agree holing an MLP inside an IRA is kind of useless because there really is no advantage and if you get over 1k in UBI you still pay taxes; also I believe there are some tax write offs in some cases you wouldn't be able to take advantage of being in an IRA",SirGlass,6,/r/investing/comments/ny6zn7/taxes_for_mlps_and_cefs_inside_ira/h1imqvi/,0.076,0.845,0.079,0.086

73,IBKR," >brokerages let ordinary people subscribe to any HK IPO from no-name firms to big ones like Alibaba or Budweiser

That's pretty awesome. From my experience on the US side, I never see top tier offers. I bought my shares of Alibaba on the open market a few days after IPO. Last year, I had multiple brokers and only got a 1 offering the first 9 months of the year. It was for a pretty bad company too. 

IBKR hadn't offered me any HK listed IPOs even though I am subscribed to both US & HK ipos. This is the first time they have offered me any IPO. Maybe they separate or put additional restrictions by country?

On a different tangent. Do you recognize any of the company's digital investments? I don't know any of those companies, but if they had some more recognizable name like ZA bank or Mox then it would improve confidence in their ability to invest in companies. They mentioned Airstar bank which is a join venture between Xiaomi and AMTD Intl (the parent company). That is a name and is 1 of only 8 online banking licenses given by the government. Problem is AMTD Intl only owns a 10% stake in that and it hasn't even been reflected in their own stock prices. They seem to be pushing that AMTD Digtl's other investments can be integrated with it to provide an support or top-down Fin servicing like SoFi/Ally are trying to do stateside.",zxc123zxc123,1,/r/investing/comments/nxrqpa/ibkr_finally_offers_an_equity_ipo_amtd_digital/h1j8vlr/,0.028,0.838,0.135,0.9787

I’m 42 years old and have a family of six. I live in the United States. I make approx 90-100k a year, which doesn’t leave much to play with in the end (sad isn’t it). My goal is to make money for my retirement in the next 15-20 yrs, and also have money to help my kids if needed. I can handle some risks. I understand you gotta take risks to make big returns sometimes. But I like security. So maybe I’m like 40/60 risk/security. I currently am on Robinhood. I’ve spent about $1300 over the past couple months. I spent about $100 on each company I’ve invested in. Figured that was a good start and would diversify my holdings. And make it easier to see profit/loss. I have holdings in Fuelcell, Ford, Roblox, Virgin Galactic, Mind Medicine, Seelos, Senseonics, Tonix, Northern Oil and Gas, BlackBerry, WISH, UWM and PayPal. I’ve also invested about $800 in crypto. 
I’m wondering if my diversity is good?  Which platform do you think is most user-friendly?  Robinhood is pretty easy to navigate. Any up and coming stocks you recommend?

Now the price is around $ 50. I sold a few thousand shares at $ 49.9. If hedge funds do not manipulate the price below $ 40 next week, more than 400k options will go through. It will mean a gamma squeeze. So, then they have to bring the price down below $ 40. Does that mean that I can then in all probability buy back the shares I sold for $ 49? And then go pretty much plus. So either they do not get the price down and then it flies up when 40 million shares may need to be bought, or the price is below $ 40 and I can then go with about 8-10 dollars profit on the shares sold.

RETIREMENT: I deployed with my National Guard unit and put a bit of money towards my TSP. The TSP is nice because of the contribution matching and the fact that I never notice the missing money. Last I checked I have about 11k of value inside it with $900(?) from employer contributions. I’m back on drill status and putting 60% of my drill paychecks toward it. This is approximately $200 monthly with more from Annual training. In addition to this I started a ROTH IRA in 2020 while deployed and have $4,200 inside that.

I wanted to get opinions from strangers on the internet about my holdings. I am 20 years old and currently attending university. Additionally I am an E4 in the NG and employed part time at a grocery chain earning $15 hourly. I live at home still but plan to move back up to university next year.

RETIREMENT: I deployed with my National Guard unit and put a bit of money towards my TSP. The TSP is nice because of the contribution matching and the fact that I never notice the missing money. Last I checked I have about 11k of value inside it with $900(?) from employer contributions. I’m back on drill status and putting 60% of my drill paychecks toward it. This is approximately $200 monthly with more from Annual training. In addition to this I started a ROTH IRA in 2020 while deployed and have $4,200 inside that. I have to put another $5k in it for FY2021 to max it out, which is top priority now.

PORTFOLIO: Current value: 34.5k, 2.8k in unrealized gains. Pays 2.4k annually in dividends. I realize this is close to “yield chasing” and that I should aim to focus more on value. A year ago I had approximately 15k invested in F which wasn’t the smartest decision but I sold at 50% gains which net me a lot more money. I still hold about 1.5k in F. Larger positions I hold are T, ABBV, CRT, TWO, WBA, GSDB, DAL, NVDA, HUBS, CRM, These make up 15k. ETFs/Funds I hold are QYLD, RYLD, PDI, VNQ, and SWYJX. These make up 18.5k.

As far as my goals go I would like to hit 50k in net assets in my Schwab account. To do this I need to save another 10k. I am aiming to hit it by 2022 which is ambitious I know. It’s mostly a test to see how extreme I can get with saving and selling off stuff to downsize. If the market goes red of course it’s not going to be possible.

You may want to consider looking into some ETFs which will give you much better diversification and more stability.

If you’re sticking with individual stocks then I would recommend buying something else as opposed to doubling down. If you can buy the dip in U/PLTR then you can buy the dip in other companies.

However you probably do not have your price of options right, if the stock is at $20 and a put with a $30 strike should have a premium of over 1k as that is the intrinsic value.

120,GM," CNN already hyping up GM shareholder meeting on 6/14. Technicals point to a cup and handle breakout over the next four weeks. 

With this being a year where The CEO will face questions over the dividend reinstatement, she will quickly pivot the conversation to reinvesting free cash flow into EV and crushing Tesla and Ford. While Ford is well positioned, GM has the edge as there’s far more ability to invest without new debt or shareholder dilution.

121,SA," Vallourec SA (VLOWY) heavy short -1d oversold - is one of the several great candidates that made it through the screen. While there are numerous reasons why this stock is a great choice, here are the most vital ones:
Investors' growing interest in a stock is reflected in its recent price increase. A price change of 12.6% over the past four weeks positions the stock of this company well in this regard.
While any stock can see a spike in price for a short period, it takes a real momentum player to deliver positive returns for a longer time frame. VLOWY meets this criterion too, as the stock gained 12.5% over the past 12 weeks.

123,AMC," How to think next Friday June 18th  swing trade AMC with 400k+ call options ITM?

Now the price is around $ 50. I sold a few thousand shares at $ 49.9. If hedge funds do not manipulate the price below $ 40 next week, more than 400k options will go through. It will mean a gamma squeeze. So, then they have to bring the price down below $ 40. Does that mean that I can then in all probability buy back the shares I sold for $ 49? And then go pretty much plus. So either they do not get the price down and then it flies up when 40 million shares may need to be bought, or the price is below $ 40 and I can then go with about 8-10 dollars profit on the shares sold.

I use E*TRADE and have for years. No real problems and the customer service is amazing if you have questions/concerns. I’ve heard great things about TD Ameritrade but haven’t personally used. I also use Robinhood for my crazy speculative/small amount of crypto. Honestly don’t like that platform other than how easy they make it to purchase options.

Sectors to think about: cannabis and sports betting are inevitable in my opinion. Clean energy or more so companies that can actually figure out social responsibility(ESG) within investing. My guess is $100 spread within Amazon or apple(since you used those) would return a better value over time than finding that gem of a $1 stock. Hope it helps and good luck!

153,CPA," They are correct that he doesn’t pay tax till he sells the stock.  The way in which they are wrong is that his creation has created more tax revenue for cities, states, payroll taxes, and investment taxes ( everyone buying and selling Amazon stock) than almost any human alive.  His contribution to the tax base is larger than almost any human on the planet. 

The amount of tax revenue he has generated for the world is incalculable.  

If you vote to allow taxing unrecognized investment gains… you will create the e largest tax increase on the middle class in history.  Imagine paying tax on the value of your home each year based on what it’s worth?  Imagine starting a farm and as the price of land goes up paying taxes on that increase without any money to do so… the ideas they want to use to tax gains that aren’t realized will destroy every small business in America.  Just to get a valuation of your business costs about 10-15k if you hire a CPA.  When it’s required that you go and get an appraisal for your home each year snd then claim that gain… what do you think will happen to the cost of appraisals when the law requires you to get one? 

The whole idea being presented is financial illiteracy and it’s so poorly thought out it’s amazing.",BoochieShibbs,4,/r/investing/comments/nycgqt/why_does_npr_claim_stock_grants_arent_taxed/h1jm6g2/,0.044,0.839,0.117,0.9185

156,AAPL," >However when I look into the details of the option I see very little volume. Should I be worried about this?

Yes, it's better to trade options with high liquidity (e.g. ARKK instead of ARKX, although I understand here you are going for Space) and a low volume/liquidity option basically means you may not get what the option is ""worth"" when you're trying to sell it, because there's few buyers out there.  Your $20 LEAPs are $3.40 per contract, lets say you bought it and it went up to $5/contract, well since there are so few buyers and sellers you may struggle to find a buyer to pay $5 and need to drop your price. 

>Also, if my assumption is correct and the stock sees massive gains would I be stuck holding an option so I.T.M that I cant sell it? 

I don't know what you mean here; the deeper ITM the option, the more valuable it is, the more people are willing to pay.


>should I roll them every 6 months or so?


I think people do this but there is no right answer. Some people let their LEAPs expire worthless, others will roll 4-6 weeks out (when theta decay starts to become a large factor), some will close out the LEAP when it's up a certain percentage. Depends on you and your goals. 



I gotta say, if you're making a bet on Space tech, I'm not even sure LEAPs are the way to go, they are way too short term for Space. You might be better off just buying UFO or ARKX and sitting on the shares 30 years, and then learning trading LEAPs on SPY or AAPL or whatever",oarabbus,7,/r/investing/comments/nxwaw5/space_industry_leap_arkx/h1h78sw/,0.081,0.855,0.064,-0.4379

158,BFLY," If you’re interested in getting into true space plays, there’s a couple upcoming mergers: one is SpaceX’s most serious competitor, the other has Gates pushing money at it.

With the mergers you can purchase shares, warrants, or a combination of the two. Warrants act similar to LEAPS in that you are taking on greater risk/reward but have plenty of time to exercise or sell if it plays out.

Be very familiar with the risks though! Both with the mergers (like the strike price your warrant becomes profitable at) and the industry - profitable space companies might be years away.

Having good returns off warrants in the past (lucked out and timed BFLY really well), and being bullish on the underlying, I have a good stake in one of those mentioned above",cryptohick,3,/r/investing/comments/nxwaw5/space_industry_leap_arkx/h1hsy6y/,0.039,0.777,0.184,0.9643
