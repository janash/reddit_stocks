36,SQ," So I strongly disagree with your statement that SQ will only be successful with high network individuals. You’re missing a few important things here: 

1. You don’t need to solely rely on wealthy customers to continue to grow a business.. especially given the fact that SQ relies on transaction volumes which positions itself to benefit from lower income users since there are more of those therefore increasing volume 
2. wealthy clients pay on time so SQ/Afterpay wouldn’t benefit from that with late fees. Again; their target market will bring in increased revenue from late fee’s whereas this wouldn’t be as prevalent with high network individuals. 

Just because SQ isn’t capturing the wealthier end of clientele doesn’t mean it can’t in the future. And what if that’s not their goal? 

I think you may need to look deeper into SQ’s business model and what Wall Street looks for in their earnings since it seems like you’re missing some key info here.",Gotl0stinthesauce,12,/r/stocks/comments/owrcvf/sq_and_afterpay_please_dont_fall_for_it_seriously/h7idpm9/,0.061,0.789,0.15,0.9424

40,HUGE," So there's a lot to deconstruct from OP's arguments here. 

First of all, it's STUPID to look at the EBITDA multiple for Afterpay, given this company is fully allocated to growth in marketshare at the moment. It's a HUGE market and gaining market share now is critically more important than profit. It's the classic Amazon mistake, and why so many investors missed out on Amazon early on because 'their EBITDA' multiple was ridiculous. 

Secondly, Afterpay's global footprint is still just a smidgeon of what it could be, with a strong balance sheet, such as Square's. Capital to aggressively enter new markets will be an incredible asset to Afterpay. BNPL is capital intensive as an industry and definitely a limiting factor for expansion.

Thirdly, synergise with Square's payment platform. What if there is an incentive for Small businesses that use Square, to offer Afterpay over other BNPLs? Aside from strict exclusivity (which may be regulated out), there's no doubt that this could be a powerful partnership that could disrupt BNPLs and offer something that the other BNPLs cannot.

By the way I could’ve sworn I seen somebody just asked me about my option. And then I mean at the 270 and not the 370 no you saw that right the 370 square is capable of doing massive numbers in a very small amount of time I rode square from 125 to 3:50 in like two weeks so my monthly will print just fine. It’s actually probably put around one if I was to guess CNS yesterday I move like 30% move like $30 in a day $28 in a day some like that. I’m expecting Square in a lot of fin Tech block chain companies to do outstanding numbers right now at least over the next couple months. So at the beginning of this thing the square jumps off 30 bucks on one day I can simply just take the current share price and do a little bit of multiplication in a little bit of division and come up with a wide average yes $400. Don’t remind me if I’m wrong OK

I don’t know if it was your question or not I’m just putting it in here cause I know I sought to answer that though I’ll never be in that option that long I’m only interested in the equity move so I’m looking for a big push in one day you know as soon as it makes a big push to the upside the equity in the contracts gonna go through the roof and I’m gonna cash it out most likely I’ll cash it and I’ll wait for the pool back and then I’ll enter it again",EasyBeeTrader,2,/r/stocks/comments/owrcvf/sq_and_afterpay_please_dont_fall_for_it_seriously/h7kymc8/,0.035,0.863,0.102,0.9453

 of course I got plenty stocks it then I’m in for fundamentals or for technology or we would have you. But what I was speaking about is that the move from the options market or the stock market into the crypto market and trying to to trade that, as in a daytrading type environment or atmosphere. 

because crypto is a much more volatile moving asset and and even when you set a stop loss with crypto you get  stop out immediately.  I mean you ever tried to put a stop loss on the Bitcoin.  it’ll it’ll freefall to make the order. then it’ll it’ll roll back up again. which is kind of weird to me I don’t really understand that. 

I  been stopped out so many times and kept from making money that I don’t set my stop loss anymore.  I just have to watch it 24 seven and sometimes I pass out. I’ve been liquidated a couple times because of it because I’m I’m leveraging and I’m leveraging heavy at 10 X mostly because I’m not a rich guy and I’m trying to build my cryoto  portfolio before this next bull run takes off. 

 I wanna have a good foundation and so I’ve been going balls out. That saidI’ve since pulled back a little and  lowered my margin levels so that is more manageable. I was just speaking into the fact that crypto is a much different asset in the way that it moves and how it reacts to the market and I had to pay tuition  to figure that out LOL

I’m sure ur wondering why I have to use margin if I do well in options. The short answer of TDA took p personal vendetta out on me. Causing me to hemorrhage half I made in 5 days by refusing to let me close my positions due to a false “ fraud investigation “ Which never to turn up anything they didn’t have the rest of my money for 60 days in the same loophole and my daughter left to go live with her mother and I set my riches down after 27 years and decided I was going to hell I want to from now on.

I’ve been liquidated a couple times because of it because I’m I’m leveraging and I’m leveraging heavy at 10 X mostly because I’m not a rich guy and I’m trying to build my cryoto  portfolio before this next bull run takes off. 

 I wanna have a good foundation and so I’ve been going balls out. That saidI’ve since pulled back a little and  lowered my margin levels so that is more manageable. I was just speaking into the fact that crypto is a much different asset in the way that it moves and how it reacts to the market and I had to pay tuition  to figure that out LOL

I’m sure ur wondering why I have to use margin if I do well in options. The short answer of TDA took p personal vendetta out on me. Causing me to hemorrhage half I made in 5 days by refusing to let me close my positions due to a false “ fraud investigation “ Which never to turn up anything they didn’t have the rest of my money for 60 days in the same loophole and my daughter left to go live with her mother and I set my riches down after 27 years and decided I was going to hell I want to from now on.

Disagree. This is far to broad a comment to be correct.

Example: OVV did a reverse 5:1 split last year because they had significantly more shares outstanding than their peers due to deals settled in equity. Market cap was always comparable but share price never *seemed* to be due to the number of shares outstanding. The reverse split put them in a comparable situation to those they're measured against. 

Even if the share price went up 5x without the split, the situation wasn't comparable and, as a result, OVV suffered. They now no longer suffer from that issue.",Chucktholemew,10,/r/stocks/comments/ox2pi8/ge_made_me_shit_myself/h7kr0zt/,0.107,0.72,0.173,0.7574

I bought as soon as I learned that they supply chips in the PS5 and new Xbox, even when the chip shortage ends I think they’ll be in high demand for years. The Xilinx acquisition will do good things for the cloud side as well.

$TGT - Just look at their long term chart, favorite retail play. They are also one of my favorite places to shop, their app works great for pickup and delivery as well. 

$XPO/GXO- just recently split up it’s logistics from their trucking side of their business. I think both sides will have pretty great success. Mainly I just think they’re blowing up as I see their trucks literally everywhere in the PNW. On the trucking side they do LTL(less than truckload) which for example they made a lot of money picking up people’s recalled Peloton machines. They also own 212 million sq feet of warehouse space for the supply chain logistics side of their business. Not everyone knows this, but there are pretty tough shortages on warehouse space(even more so for cold space) these days with e commerce growing as much as it has.

Large organizations, including businesses, governments, and NGOs, are facing increasingly complex situations and overwhelmed by mass amounts of data located in disconnected systems.  

For leaders to make good decisions, they need to understand what is going on within their organizations, and that means finding some way to organize and visualize that data.  Organizations that cannot understand their situations will make bad decisions and experience massive inefficiencies or even failures in their operations. 

Palantir provides software platforms (Foundry and Gotham) that install into a client's computer systems, absorb data, and allow the client to organize and visualize that data.  This allows decision makers to do things like spot problems in supply chains, detect inefficiencies in production lines, or anticipate levels of opposition during military conflicts.

The ability to quickly detect, understand, and then remedy problems in complex scenarios is a critical competitive advantage.  Palantir has some interesting demo videos that show real world applications for their software.  One example is food distribution to hungry populations worldwide: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iisb3OclVEQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iisb3OclVEQ)

A moat in the industry with leading in many sectors? Expanding into streaming and eSPort? A recognizable name and respected?

Healthy margins at 27% in manufacturing, but looking at the sector, they should easily be able to reach the 40% margin in the next few years?

Something like 70% undervalued compared to competitors? About 70-80% upside to the analyst targets?

Cineplex pre-pandemic was an investors darling.  It used to have a strong dividend payout  and was worth $34/share just before the pandemic hit.

Theaters have been closed in Canada for the first six months of the year and began opening in mid June and are mostly all open as of late July (with very few restrictions).  With Canada keeping in more COVID restrictions than the US and a higher vaccination rate the chance of another large shutdown is unlikely.

Someone can clarify, but my question to you (or sharper minds in general) is 'how' or 'why' would a higher price possibly mean that institutions can fuck with the price less (rather than more).  It seems to me that a higher price would just mean retail loses more power to them proportionally.  Market Makers and other hedge funds can seemingly always set higher orders of magnitude to their options (and play hikinks to compound that).

I don't understand how increasing the price could do anything but be obstacles to entry and reduce the control for retail stock holders.

\[Off topic I have wacky theories about Amazon and hedge fund collusion that may be confirmation biasing my thinking...because it seems to be among or the stock MOST covetetted and controlled by institutions (of which Bezos was part of before starting it), while there is a very neat and traceable history of institutions doing all they can to invest heavy in Amazon and use any means necessary to bankrupt Amazon's competition.

There is no reason to over expose yourself to a single company. AMZN could attract anti-trust regulations in the future, they could have small price swings over major goverment contracts (ie. MSFT vs AMZN), brick and mortar stores (Target, Wal-Mart, etc..) might become more popular again...perhaps they better integrate a product into urban areas, etc...

258,IMO," As a newer trader stay away from options. Use a ""fake"" cash account to practice your options trading and don't risk it until you have a solid method figured out. There's a reason options trading can be very profitable, because there's a lot of risk and trillions of dollars from institutions with much better tools than you. Not worth the risk for you IMO.

I would DCA into some positions you still like and keep some cash on hand. Whether it be 70%, 50%, 30% etc. to buy the dips.

But if your strategy is to wait for a big dip, then stick to it. But there's a reason DCAing and holding is the king for retail investors. Historically, DCA + time in market >>> timing the market.

I saw a post a while ago on the difference of DCAing vs. buying the dips. You'd make relatively the same unless you time the dips perfectly, like within 5-10%. And timing those dips is impossible (unless you're an insider probably). S&P only had 2 major dips in recent history, 2008 and 2020, so the large profit dips are few and far between.",Zrocker04,2,/r/stocks/comments/ox0683/lets_assume_a_20_crash_happens_in_the_next_couple/h7kv34t/,0.007,0.855,0.138,0.9697

260,WM," 20% is a fairly firm down #.  Theres really no telling how sharp a sell-off would be.

Your not the only one holding cash and waiting, I have a few positions in the red that are holds, and a few from 2010 that would have to fall %300+.
   After a pullback try and gauge the public sentiment.  If a bottom forms and its not a sharp recovery you should have a list of companies that have low price but good value(offer something people need) also help if it in something you know or use yourself.  Put a percentage in as a bottom forms and cost average from there on the recovery.
   At this point inflation on any dip in excess of 6 months would have to be brought into consideration.  The gov for sure would try some sort of rescue, unfortunately.

My guess is that a  large drop will increase IV, meaning they're pricing in a move either way. So buying an option when IV increases is less profit once it rebounds I think. Don't take my word for it because I'm just typing this out to try to understand it myself. 

It might make sense to backtest that method. I would be interested to know if buying options at a dip would be more profitable than buying shares. Like in March of 2020. Or does IV pop and subside quickly enough for you to buy in 1-5 days after the dip, would that be more profitable or would buying at the bottom make more sense?

267,TV," I see this as a positive development. First, they are selling a chunk of the company, so they are getting money for it. That is a divestment.

But also, DirectTV is a good product if they turn into the streaming trend and not only compete with it. The cost of maintaining satellites is fixed no matter the amount of subscribers. Many people are wanting to cut cable costs, but are becoming overburdened at the added expense of buying too many streaming services to get everything they want. Even cable subscribers often want Netflix.

The pitfalls of using DSB over cable become less noticeable if you can stream content during bad weather in an integrated way. DSB could feasibly offer savings over cable, while allowing people to use streaming platforms without paying for 10 extra services to maintaining news, sports, and liked cable stations or paying for a streaming cable platform that doesn't offer much in savings and consumes internet bandwidth during peak prime-time hours at home.

I just see this as a good platform for more consumers to buy into cable-lite switching to streaming platforms, if they turn into it. They could attract more existing cable subscribers seeking to be 1/2 in streaming services and wanting some form of cable services for less.

DSB also has a good set of customers in rural areas that are lacking access to cable services and high-bandwidth internet services. They have a solid market in parts, if they can learn maintain other parts of other markets. AT&T also sell internet services and they have a direct interest in alleviating bandwidth problems caused by people streaming live TV content that can be broadcasted  in real time from satellites. They can make their internet service better by packaging DSB into a bundle for people to use with easy transitions between DSB and streaming.

319,PLTR," A lot of growth stocks that IPO'd since last fall now under their IPO price, in reality I think the IPO price was inflated by hype in all these stocks and influx of retail investors.

this really sets us up for grand illusion that growth has ""corrected"". in reality, growth is still headed towards its baseline, the run up in growth in late 2020 was an anomoly and is going to look similar to the clean energy boom and fall of 2008 (but not as severe and things should rebound more quickly)

Aside from the companies actually headed towards making money (Nio/Tesla), I'd expect most growth to continue to slowly push down from here for the next few years.  For those that believe in these stocks, I think DCA slowly over time is a good strategy, as these will head even lower in the next 1-3 years.  My strategy is long puts on growth stocks while DCA down slowly.

I feel bad for those invested in ARKK and ARKG - I expect these to continue to fall further and further to pre fall 2020 levels and remain there for a long, long, long time.

and bring on the downvotes, I keep getting them but growth keeps declining so...

Been in this stock at $6.8 since nov last year after it beat earnings and dropped, but unfortunately recoup my initial capital and sold most of my shares at 11.5$.

I think the big question for BGFV is how long it can sustain this profit level. If they show that they can sustain it through multiple quarters after COVID, share price should adjust so dividends stay around 3%, and PE should adjust to 7+, due to lower revenue growth. If interest rate goes up and inflation goes up, there should be more demand for high dividend low PE steady profits company. Also in the consumer spending so they probably have some room to pass on inflation cost to customer.

Another thing that could be a pro or a con : steady high short interest at around 25-30%. If WSB goes crazy again, BGFV might be a candidate for short squeeze pump.",Malamonga1,1,/r/stocks/comments/ox987d/thoughts_on_big_5_sporting_goods_bgfv_before/h7lgri8/,0.071,0.759,0.17,0.9644

527,IMO," Ya you could do something like 20% cash, 60-70% low risk etfs and 10-20% to use for more “risky” plays. For the riskier plays I’m liking Evs as the up and comers for the next 5-10 years. Stuff like nio and charge point. I’m also liking Jumia right now. Both charge point and jumia IMO are at good buys right now in the low twenties. 

Small is fine but as I mentioned you don’t want to be too weighted in any one thing. As it stands you have probably like 25% Microsoft and google with how heavily weighted both the spy and qqq are towards them. Both are very safe but never hurts to be prepared for the unknown.",Neebs369,2,/r/stocks/comments/owz3zd/portfolio_advice/h7jqbwx/,0.047,0.743,0.21,0.9593
528,IMO," S&P is the lowest risk. Tech is overinflated IMO based on the recent history of modern finance, so I’d not go too heavy on that. Emerging Markets investment fund with something like Investec or Blackrock might be a good one. It’s SME’s in BRICS nations for regions of new development. Housing, infrastructure and trade in up-coming middle class countries will beat tech stocks that are due a contraction rather than boom at this point. Invest in certainties like population growth and demographic change, not adding into a technological peak which is already overpumped. That’s my advice.

531,ABC," Yes and no to ""only perception of value"". You're a bit off the mark on some stuff.

Yes shares represent ownership in the company. In this example you are giving ABC company a valuation of One million USD. If at the time of this IPO your revenue is 750k then you'd have an extremely conservative valuation

Now let's say that factory did the company well and no one speculated on your company/no share holders sold so the share price is still at a $1 (this sort of thing is unrealistic irl).

The factory brings in another million in revenue. So now your company is extremely undervalued as the revenue far exceeds the valuation.

People start bidding to get their slice of your company with the share price going higher till someone is willing to sell and others are willing to buy in at that price to keep it there.

As your company grows so should the value of owning part of the company. It goes up partly based of what we call fundamentals and a bit of speculation where the company is going.

So you the individual want to grow your money and one way to do that is through ownership in companies that have growth opportunity and or stable financials that are passed to you (dividend s) based off of your stake in the company.",JustNotFatal,1,/r/stocks/comments/owygpf/why_would_anyone_want_to_purchase_stocks_in_the/h7j2fe4/,0.018,0.857,0.125,0.9677
