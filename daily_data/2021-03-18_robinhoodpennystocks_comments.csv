21,DD," I’m a fairly new investor. Very small account. I got into this stock at $1.34. No DD, no info, no quick turnaround. Here’s why...

1. It was cheap. It’s lowest point in many years. Last 5 years it’s been a consistent $8-11 stock. It took a shit when everything started shutting down (airlines).
2. They got new military contracts coming in. 
3. The airline industry is going to rebound eventually. 
4. More recently we have seen numerous airline engines catching fire and having problems. These are NOT RR engines and RR has already grabbed some of this business and is poised to grab more. 
5. They just got the exclusive contract to supply engines for a particular new model of Airbus planes. This also comes with maintenance contracts. 

With all of these factors, my semi-functional brain told me that there is a possibility this stock rebounds to $4 this summer as travel restrictions continue to loosen. And, there is potential for the company to crawl out of its debt hole if they continue to take bites out of their competitors business. It’s continued, methodical, slow climb up already has guys like me well into the green. It’s not unreasonable to throw a few bucks at this and sit on it for a while either, as they do pay a small dividend. 

Again... I’m new and I’m certainly not bragging. But, I’m in the green overall and this stock is one of the reasons why.

Did you miss the massive shift away from wide body aircraft to narrow body? RR has way too much tied up in A380 service contracts with their Trent 900. Long term growth relies on them developing a platform suitable for narrow body or pivoting away from commercial aviation. 

Basing a $15k bet off of ""chatter"" is a smooth brain move when there are already industry giants in the space they might be trying to diversify into. You cannot spin up industry dominance in something as saturated as clean energy in five years. No way.

41,MS," I think there may be upside to most auto manufacturers soon. Parts supplies are dwindling, and that will make new vehicles harder to get. That will drive prices up at retail, but I’m not sure how that will affect profits at the manufacturing level. Mazda and Toyota have both recently had their target prices doubled by Morgan Stanley, but their currently trading price is still greater than the target by about a dollar. 

Both are reported as underweight, and outlooks on both are cautious. Mazda beat earnings last quarter by a bit, and that seems to have buoyed them a little, but looking at the five year history, I’d say March is not the ideal time to buy a Japanese auto stock. Maybe June or July, and sell in September-December. 

The MS report mentioned that Mazda has recently done some cost cutting in their supply chain and that may help, but they are expected to lose money this year. They are 100% dependent on Toyota for ev development and supply, so it’s possible that if Toyota has a breakthrough, Mazda could benefit. For now, I see their stock prices linked, with Mazda trading at ~10% of Toyota’s price. So maybe it’s a cheap way to get in, but I don’t know that Mazda is going to wow anybody with something new and innovative that could drive that share price from 4-40 (Or 8-80 for MZDAF).",kamandi,1,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/m7pdk6/mazda_a_undervalued_stock_should_u_get_in_before/greshkc/,0.051,0.844,0.105,0.9476

43,ICE," This is from a consumer perspective, not an investor, but Mazda is heavily focused on maximizing ICE efficencieny.

The car could run on EITHER gas OR hydrogen fuel. Isn’t that wild! It’s the car to move us towards a greener planet! 

Well, they didn’t mass produce them. 
They put it on the shelf. 
That was fun.
