Basically, this thing can go either way.  It can recover if deposits return, in which case you may recover your money and possibly even make a decent profit.  But it can also go to zero through a take under fire sale in which equity is rendered worthless as well as possibly some bonds such as in the CS case.

Fourth, if you‚Äôre going to trade, then get off Robinhood and get on a real trading platform like Thinkorswim. IMHO, Robinhood‚Äôs a joke of a platform.

Lastly, healthy and sustainable trading is all about matching your risk tolerance with investment risk. And, it seems like you took on more risk than you wanted. So, de-risk your position with opposite positions until you have the appropriate amount of risk.",jojobeebo,6,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/120ak8d/please_help_i_have_not_slept_im_days_this_is/jdgqncs/,0.084,0.771,0.145,0.8818

48,FRC," I‚Äôd add that they have clearly tried to sell the bank to various other institutions, none of which have wanted to do so thus far. 

A bank is worth its assets (bonds, loans etc) minus its liabilities (mostly deposits). There‚Äôs a little bit of value in buildings, staff, brand, relationships, but generally that‚Äôs a rounding error. The equity is roughly the value of assets - liabilities. 

Both assets and liabilities are somewhere in the region of $150-200bio. The market cap of FRC is $2-3bio. Assets held in securities (treasuries, MBS etc) are easy to value and have gone down. Assets like a $250k mortgage to Joe Bloggs at 3% made in 2019 are harder to value but you can approximate a fall in value based on how rates have moved since and what you currently charge for the same mortgage. Clearly the mortgage book has fallen in value as well but harder to quantify. 

If assets are lower than liabilities then the bank is technically insolvent, but if deposits don‚Äôt all get pulled it might struggle along to some point in the future where loans get paid back and new loans are at higher interest rates and it creeps back to solvency. Rates can fall and assets can rise in value too. 

This is kind of where we probably are right now. The assets are lower than the liabilities so no one wants to buy it. The current value of the equity if it was sold/broken up/went into chapter 11 is therefore probably zero. 

But you can look at equity as a call option on the value of the company with a strike price at assets-liabilities. Your equity can only go to zero. If the bank survives and assets go back up your equity will have some positive value. 

So look at it this way, you don‚Äôt own a stock right now, you own a call option on First Republic‚Äôs balance sheet. YAY options. 

Right now there is a decent enough probability FRC goes to zero. But there‚Äôs clearly some scenario where in 6 months it‚Äôs trading $50+ or gets bought. 

If you like YOLOing everything into options, you‚Äôre right at home in WSB, and that‚Äôs what you‚Äôve done. Congrats you‚Äôre home!",cwep2,93,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/120ak8d/please_help_i_have_not_slept_im_days_this_is/jdgx86i/,0.071,0.724,0.205,0.9949

119,AI," Counter point: Without QE infinity everyone in the market would have lost a money. 

The fed has tried to real this back twice now, neither time made it very far and look at the results of trying each time. This isn't rocket surgery. Go back to '08, look at the big, and lasting moves in the Dow since. They nearly parallel changes in the Fed balance sheet.

So, why are institutions entrusted with so much money that is forced into the stock market? Because the Fed has continuously manipulated the bond market and interest rate into forcing those actions. This has given corporations insane valuations relative to earnings (the return) and allowed for cheap leveraging of their valuations as well. This has lead to all sorts of distortions in the market and the real economy (ie shit getting sold at a loss - which is value/capital destruction, but we're OK with that essentially thanks to free QE money). 

Also, the market is not a zero sum game with some winners and some losers. Specifically, individual actors (including investors that allocate their capital properly) can cause the growth they seek. While regards deploying their capital poorly do actually destroy it. QE has incentivized risker capital allocation and harmed real growth this way - ie more people propping up value destroying companies like Uber.

The ""real"" economy (highlight by OP) doesn't matter only as long as the Fed's shell game can continue, which might be a long time, but it is not forever. Ordinary people's production (which has been decreasing) and their spending power (also decreasing) matter to markets as well. If those things go down, so does the market absent distortions like QE.

So can QE just actually go on forever? Well, we have seen the answer is no. QE and federal government deficits funded ordinary people's lost production through COVID, now we have inflation. We're paying more to get less stuff done and less stuff of value made. QE creeped into the 'real' economy instead of just backing bank balance sheets and making corporate loans cheaper. More QE isn't going to solve this, its going to make it worse now. We need value destroying companies to die or value destroying portions of companies to close (ie, Facebook's dumb venture into the metaverse).

Your last paragraph is your own capitulation to this point. The liquidity you reference is only there thanks to the Fed actions. But they can't keep providing 'free' liquidity in a stagnated 'real' economy. In fact, inflation and higher rates are already breaking stuff. Yes, SVB is small in the seem of things, but that's just the canary in the coal mine. The problem is debt costs are rising and we have A LOT of debt. Paying off this debt and rising debt maintenance cost IS a liquidity trap. Its going to happen at the Fed, its going to happen to our Federal Government and national debt, it will happen at more banks, it will happen to corporations and it will happen to ordinary people.

As an investor, you can probably still find the diamonds in the rough, where despite essentially secular decline, you'll see growth (this is probably why NVDA has gone bonkers on the idea that AI will take over and ordinary people will be broke, but NVDA and other AI software generators will be rich!).

121,VERY," The hike is not what kicks shit in the nuts.  Rates staying  high for an extended time is what pulls the extra liquidity from the market.  That's when shit gets ugly or not.

If people thought the drop last fall was everything, they are in for a rough ride as rates stay high.  This is an entirely different market and businesses appear to be preparing for tough times by splurging like crazy and hiring tons of people.

This is usually not a good sign, but fuck maybe the printer gets turned back on.  I'm not psychic and the fed definitely does not inspire any faith in it's policies or conviction.  They're still a few percentage points below the effective inflation (which is basically what you need rates to get higher than to actually get inflation under control) and appear to be basically trying to pray it away. If interest rates are below 6% and yoy inflation is projected at 6%, it's still negative effective rates, just less negative.

153,MMM," You do realize these banks use their balance sheets for collateral? 

We're getting ready to seen a tsunami of withdrawals in the next 60 days once the  public's recognition of the fact takes hold that the FDIC can cover just 1.5% of all demand deposits.

Businesses, non profits, LLC, teaching institutions, and of course retirees holding above $250,000 with bank CD's all decide to seek saftey immediately.

Your going the see the folly of the decision to drop the reserve requirements to 0%. 

MMM does not calculate ""fear and greed"" in any of its theoretical assertions. It leaves out the nastiness of a capital collapse from consideration. It leaves out the brutality and fear of the counter parties in a financial transaction.

I've been there. I've experienced it first hand. This is the moment that all the undisciplined behavior by these banks is going to be discovered and brought to the light.

Banking and capital preservation needs a ""hard discipline"" to make sure capital allocation is accountable and controlled.

Otherwise (as you saw with Credit Suisse last weekend) executives run for cover and all the skills that were supposed to keep a collapse from happening... disappears.",DYTTIGAF,11,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/120143p/fed_balance_sheet/jdgpeww/,0.104,0.798,0.098,-0.0372

Every trading day for the last 1.5 years, I've hosted a community voice chat here on WallStreetBets here on Reddit, 8:30am Eastern to whenever.

On March 8th, Reddit announced they were shutting down the feature effective March 21st. You can find [the announcement here](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditTalk/comments/11m4ijn/sunsetting_reddit_talk/).

We drew incredible crowds. 6K peak concurrent listeners, nearly 2 million listeners. 42 minute average listen time.

It was a good time. From dressing up in banana suits for DOLE earnings to watching our fellow mods get suspended for running a talk called ""GANG BANG TIME"" (twice!!!). There was rarely a dull moment.

Tuesday was the last day for these Reddit Talks, but the community chat lives on in Discord. 

We've solved a lot of the problems we had on reddit. Now we have consistent notifications, easily editable emojis, smoother processes to bring people up as speakers.

I like the work you put in for your post. And while your statement isn't false, I also wouldn't agree that it's a fair assessment of VOO/SPY.

There is less diversification and overweight in tech RIGHT NOW. But the S&P500 top performers have changed throughout the years.

The point of indexes etfs and their fees is that they will automatically rotate and rebalance. Most businesses aren't successful. Even successful businesses don't always stocks that go up. Even those don't always have high ROI. Even if a business outperforms and returns higher ROI, it might only do so in a sector where it's peers are doing poorly.

***The overweight on the top performers in the SPY/VOO isn't a bug. It's the fucking feature.*** Some might need to realize this if they don't, but investors that actually real the prospectus before investing would know and buy because of it. It's overweight on tech right now because the market has deemed those as the best stocks. I know it's common on WSB to believe we're a bunch of special snowflakes that can outsmart the market but anyone with 101IQ would realize that the market is often much smarter than the average guy. Each of those companies have strong moats, high growth, strong balance sheets, strong revenue streams, high profits, return value to shareholders, etcetcetc

Ask yourself do you really want a higher % weight of SVB, SBNY, FRC, DISH, FOX, or NWS? No because they fucking suck. Look at the loss porn.  Even their smaller weights are too much because people who bought VOO/SPY had their SVB and SBNY basically go to 0. They should be fucking mad those were in there at all and glad they were saved by being overweight into MSFT & GOOG instead of those shits.

You wouldn't even want JPM, BAC, WFC, or C over the tech stocks. They are the ones getting BTFO and going back to pandemic lows. They are suffering low growth, locked into low rate bonds, have billions in unrealized losses, have the risk of bank runs or credit contagion, and are begging the government for bailouts . Fucking Apple? Has over $150B IN CASH RESERVES. You know how much fucking money that is? That was the money THE FUCKING US GOVERNMENT HAD TO PUT OUT TO BAIL OUT SVG AND SBNY. APPLE COULD HAVE BAILED THOSE FUCKS OUT BY ITSELF. THAT'S WHY THE MARKET IS BUYING APPLE AND PUSHING IT'S CAP UP. And Apple doesn't have that debt. Instead it has a strong revenue source.

Ask yourself do you really want a higher % weight of SVB, SBNY, FRC, DISH, FOX, or NWS? No because they fucking suck. Look at the loss porn.  Even their smaller weights are too much because people who bought VOO/SPY had their SVB and SBNY basically go to 0. They should be fucking mad those were in there at all and glad they were saved by being overweight into MSFT & GOOG instead of those shits.

You wouldn't even want JPM, BAC, WFC, or C over the tech stocks. They are the ones getting BTFO and going back to pandemic lows. They are suffering low growth, locked into low rate bonds, have billions in unrealized losses, have the risk of bank runs or credit contagion, and are begging the government for bailouts . Fucking Apple? Has over $150B IN CASH RESERVES. You know how much fucking money that is? That was the money THE FUCKING US GOVERNMENT HAD TO PUT OUT TO BAIL OUT SVG AND SBNY. APPLE COULD HAVE BAILED THOSE FUCKS OUT BY ITSELF. THAT'S WHY THE MARKET IS BUYING APPLE AND PUSHING IT'S CAP UP. And Apple doesn't have that debt. Instead it has a strong revenue source. 

Not really my job to tell you all what to do or think, but the great thing is that we can all make our own investments. Anyone who doesn't like the weighted S&P can go buy the equal weighted S&P or YOLO into 0DTE FRC.",zxc123zxc123,51,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/120lcdp/the_market_is_being_held_up_by_7_companies/jdidxi8/,0.116,0.738,0.145,0.9563

The most interesting scenario I could come up with from this situation is the following:

1. Warren Buffett takes Berkshire's entire cash position ($100B) and shorts QQQ. That alone would tank the market if it got out, but it's not good enough for a true doomsday scenario.
2. He sells his entire stake in AAPL, which causes the shift to begin.

464,AI, Honestly don't think Chinese companies are going to go into Generative AI. Too much political risk and not a focus of these companies. They're spending money on hardware and semiconductors with Baidu and Alibaba on RISC-V. At least for Chinese Companies there's not a compelling reason for them to do Generative AI other than it is the hot thing to do. All the government funding and priorities are in different sectors related to AI - specifically hardware.,TheCriticalAmerican,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1209a2k/baidu_is_faking_its_ai_and_only_developed_a/jdgcprm/,0.048,0.913,0.039,0.0603

468,AI," >fish flavor pork slivers

This is the actual dish btw. È±ºÈ¶ôËÇâ‰∏ù , ‰∏ù can also mean wire / threads. I've translated it to slivers because of the contextual clue of pork. So that AI generated an image of a fish with its meat in wire form. How about you google what is È±ºÈ¶ôËÇâ‰∏ù. Its one of the most common dish in chinese cuisine. Precisely because it gave multiple failed images, is why people are doubting that its made in china. Imaging your country's AI failing to recognized its national icons.

469,AI," ***So that AI generated an image of a fish with its meat in wire form.***

Which is *exactly* what the prompts asked.

Chinese uses a huge numbers of idioms which often mean something to totally  different  to the actual words. AI does *not* understand idioms and has no idea that È±ºÈ¶ôËÇâ‰∏ù is a meal.  So it takes the *literal* meaning of *individual* words and creates a fish made out of wire.

**Imaging your country's AI failing to recognized its national icons.**

513,IMO," Well my point was that it *was* better than the current system due to it not being subject to runaway inflation caused by quantitative easing.

I'm not arguing that it's a better currency (eg for use for day to day payments). 
I do think it's a better base asset than fiat currency though as it removes the human fallibility of ""let's print loads of money... Oh wait that broke something, hike interest rates... uh the banks are failing"".

An additional point is that the current system is quickly headed towards CBDCs (central bank digital currencies) and the elimination of cash. This would remove the current option of keeping your money under the mattress.
This means the if your bank fails (as they do every 10 years or so) you're just flat out of luck.

543,CPA," No you did not ""fall through the system."" In fact, ""the system"" is designed to trip people like you up in the very way you have acted, and to your serious detriment.

The IRS will just calculate your taxes for all the years you didn't file and send you a bill. The problem is they will count as ZERO the cost basis for all your trades, so even if you generated a capital loss, they will be showing a gain, using a cost basis of ZERO for each trade. This bill will likely be many, many times what you ever thought possible. At that point, you will have to hire a tax attorney and go to tax court to challenge the IRS's calculations. Your attorney will also be hiring a high priced CPA to redo all your back taxes. Should you succeed in challenging the IRS, the fees for the attorney and the CPA will be very large in addition to interest and penalties, even if you succeed.

My advice is seek out a professional CPA next week, preferably one who advertises their services as a registered agent with the IRS, these are a little more expensive but will save you money in the end. Good luck and hopefully you can file all your back taxes and get on with your life before it becomes a nightmare dealing with the IRS.
