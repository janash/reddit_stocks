7,GDP," Yeah and this seems like a bet on really high inflation. We have had the ideal conditions for runaway inflation for the past 10 years, and it never showed up. It's kind of puzzling and against economic theory that near zero interest for 10 years led to average 1.5% inflation!? 

Yes 2T is a lot but GDP is 20T in the us, and we are not even sure the fed can hit the 3% inflation target they have set. They talked about inflation on Marketplace with Kai and they arent really confident broad inflation is coming. Yes durable goods and industries that rely upon higher income consumers who survived the pandemic will probably be at or above 3% but there is no reason to believe everything is going to hit that or above as we slowly recover in the real economy.

I cant believe gold is going to double in the short run, even during the crash in March gold stayed pretty flat with equity prices. I think investing in beat down value companies without too much debt is the better play, but I'd love to be proven wrong because gold doing what op says would be pretty insane and interssting.",jpow_nudes,10,/r/investing/comments/lzqqu6/oh_what_a_setup_for_gold_bring_your_calculator/gq4q9ls/,0.084,0.731,0.185,0.9737

27,BP," I don't disagree, but it is too broad and hurts everything and everyone.  Taxes are a good way to disincentivize certain activities, but a better more targeted tax could disincentivize  the behavior you want to without all of the adverse effects.  


I think one important distinction would be to tax liquidity taking, without taxing providers of liquidities (market makers).  


I think the size (.1%) is also larger than it needs to be if the purpose is for HFTs.  If you bought and sold a stock just once per day, compounded that tax over 255 business days is a 29% tax.  HFTs are typically playing for much less than .1% as far as I'm aware.  


If you made this a 1 BP or 1/2 BP tax (.01%, .005%) on liquidity takers,  I'd be less against it.  I also think it's much smarter to start with a smaller tax than you think you might need and increase it as necessary, than to maybe overdo it and cause damage.",emc87,1,/r/investing/comments/lzt88b/financial_securities_transaction_taxes/gq4zoe9/,0.065,0.797,0.138,0.8762

Financial ( banks benefit from spreads) for example benefit from higher rates while fin tech like PayPal and SQ won’t because future earnings will be discounted and valuation will shrink, it’s just one example but if rates keep marching higher all the high growth money loosing 2020 winners will get slaughtered

32,IMO," The term ""value"" is an unfortunate classification. We're really talking about short duration vs long duration stocks. 

Short duration = low or negative growth expected, but the company is profitable *now*, as opposed to a growth stock that has most their profit potential in the future. An extreme example of short-duration is Corecivic - the company that puts Mexicans in cages. They pay a 20+% dividend but they also probably only have a few years left before they go out of business. 

SCV (small cap short duration) tends to have forward outperformance best when growth is being sold at an extreme premium. This is not unlike short vs long term bonds. 

As far as small cap value ETFs go, if you feel it's the right investment for you, at least get some sort of a quality screen as otherwise you're picking up a bunch of value traps. Vanguard's own VIOV fits the bill as the S&P 600 value index is in itself a quality screen. 

I hold some VIOV myself, but note that there are is value out there in growth stocks too, you just need to look in unconventional places. Traditional value metrics like Price/Cash Flow, Price/Book etc. works for some sectors, not for others. Public utilities for example IMO are the biggest value today, but they'll rarely turn up on value metrics as they always have poor Price/Cash Flow (the utility business typically has negative cash flow by design).",cr0ne,2,/r/investing/comments/lzias8/small_cap_value_vs_sp_500_3_5_and_10year_returns/gq3zqva/,0.06,0.757,0.183,0.9884

I am up 20% for the year so far, gained most in the last 2 weeks, my tactics were going against the trend and picking up undervalued stocks: XOM at 37, ET 6.75 and GEO 8.47 the latter still needs some time to cover but ET +20% and XOM +50% covers. 
I feel like now the trend due to inflation fear and bond yields rising goes against tech and growth stocks, and goes for energy, financials, industrials. Do you guys have any tips what stocks are disadvantaged now and are good value? I am looking at LMT which is undervalued according to DCF and DDM, but i ll probably wait for more correction and buy some tech. Any comments?

One big issue I could see is capping gains or suffer extra losses if the stock has a catalyst either positive or negative.

95,UK, Hi I'm 28 years old and live in the UK so i don't have access to Robinhood (not that I would wanna use it after recent events). Since trading212 is also not taking any new registrations i wanted to know what are peoples recommendations on alternatives to these two platforms for a beginner trader that's just starting out?

96,NOW," Not seeking “financial advice.” I’m looking for opinions as I love to learn before fully diving into anything I do in life after being burnt a few times on things that I thought would make me that bank! I’m a 23 year old. I’he recently treated the stock market (for the past 3 years of my life) as something to “get rich off of!” To say the least, I’ve probably made a combined 2k in 3 years. I’m someone who has always believed in having cash rather than having it in a bank (yes.. sadly I’m one of those that does not trust or believe in the bank). I do have physical investments such as silver and memorabilia. I am looking to get into real estate in the future and so on. 

I’m tired of trying the “get rich” strategies, seeing the market as a get rich strategy and ready to treat it as my retirement fund, savings account for future business opportunities & somewhere to grow wealth. My issue is.. where to even begin? My fear is the market “being in a bubble” and ready to explode and crash at any moment. The growing fear of inflation. So many issues. However, I’m tired of not putting extra cash I have to work. Seeing it sit there and grow less & less valuable. I want to start NOW building my wealth as many my age do not think too heavily into the stock market.

So brings me to this; where to start? Do i begin to focus on the “ETFs”. Do i look at specific sectors that are looking to grow over the years and pick specific stocks? Do i sit there and play the “investing” game as well as “options” game on the side? Are there other avenues to look into, such as “Crowdfunding” like fundrise? Is now even a good time to begin investing or are we set to see a huge market correction and stock market crash? 

Again, I’d like to see and hear opinions as this is the best way for me to learn. I’m not a hardcore conspiracy theorist, however, I do believe that a lot of info put out by these investing channels are to boost their own stocks. I just want to make sure I do this right so one day my family and I do not have to worry and stress about money like I saw my family do when times go rough.",soccerguy510,1,/r/investing/comments/lznoey/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gq3ek7h/,0.065,0.783,0.151,0.9883

108,NDLS," I think with EVs it really turned into a ""buy at any price"" mania where even things that are weak basically mooned. I think people have this notion that everyone will be driving an EV tomorrow. Eventually that will be more and more the case as mandates push more and more people towards buying EVs and prices come down, but that's not tomorrow. It's not realistic for everyone to be driving EVs tomorrow from an affordability standpoint and from an infrastructure standpoint (think about all of the condos/apartment buildings where there isn't an option right now unless you're running a very long extension cord out to a car in a lot.) Eventually there will be chargers put in, but it's not going to be overnight. With a hot theme, people can be long-term right but if they buy too much into hype, they can wind up holding the bag for a while when the hype cools off and things move back towards reality.

""Surely the EV industry is guaranteed""

I wouldn't consider anything guaranteed, but with EVs making cars isn't an easy business. Tesla has had a number of periods over the years where things looked questionable - Musk discussed that he tried to talk to Apple about a bailout/infrastructure at one point a few years. It's a difficult business - the list of auto bankruptcies in the US (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_defunct_automobile_manufacturers_of_the_United_States) is a very long one and includes Fisker, which...recently went public again via SPAC.

While a very different thing, the whole EV boom recently sort of feels in a way like the restaurant IPO boom of several years ago where people were looking for the next Chipotle. There were a lot of restaurants that went public - including NDLS (which Cramer once called ""Son of Chipotle""...yeah, no.) One of the names of that group - WING - has gone on to do very well. Some of them were bought up under or well under where they went public. Some are still trading under where they went public. Looking back years later, the % of things that actually did well in that restaurant IPO basket was pretty bad.

This period feels like people wanting the next Tesla. In a few years, I'll guess the same story plays out but probably a bit worse given the nature of the auto industry. You might get one or two success stories, a couple of deals (not necessarily at prices shareholders might like), some things that struggle and you're probably going to see some things that are added to that bankruptcy list.

So, I think a lot of EV stuff has been obliterated lately to the point where it's technically oversold and might bounce but I think it's telling people you can't have a whole portfolio of aggressive growth. If you want EV exposure, it's not ""buy all the EV plays"", it's ""what are the one or two best, highest quality ideas you have for that theme?"" ""What is a *reasonable* allocation to those plays?""

As for aggressive growth investing, being ""100% aggressive growth"" was the place to be last year (and then some - it was the best year for aggressive growth investing I can recall) but may not be the case so much this year. That's not to say ""abandon aggressive growth themes/names"" by any means, but I think if things improve people have to look for opportunities to/maybe make a little room in their portfolio for some ideas outside of hype/tech that benefit from that. Additionally, I think people have to look at their aggressive growth investments and focus more on the higher/highest quality ideas and move away a bit from more speculative bets.

As for speculative bets, not EV, but I think people have to look at something like Chamath selling all of his SPCE and go, ""maybe it's not the sure thing it seemed."" It never interested me at all, but it was so heavily hyped.  It may certainly bounce after how hard it has been sold off, but if the person who brought it public and hyped it has now sold out of it before it has even really got going....     Overall, just go through your holdings and really re-evaluate and focus on your best ideas.

126,DD," So, before I get into what strategy I would do, I'm going to recommend some educational resources for you incase you need them. So first is investor.gov, which has a great getting started section, aswell as being all round a great website for investing ""safe"", next is investopedia, which is like the Wikipedia for investing, but also as a great education section full of great articles. Finally the one I recommend the most is khan academy, which has some really spectacular videos on all things related to the stock market. Ok so now for my strategy, what I would do is split your money (not necessarily evenly) between three different stocks/ETFs, so the first one would be your stable stock/ETF, (example VOO)where you just set it and forget it. Next is your dividend one, where it should be sort of stable but with high dividends (example VYM), and now with your new found dividends I'd reinvest back into your stable and the following. The following is what usually is a individual stock, but could be an etf. So the following would be something that you really believe in, something that you think is undervalued and will grow. This doesn't necessarily have to be 100% safe, as you have your stable stock and to a extent your dividend stock to rely on. So an example would be Sony, which is a company I feel really passionate about on which I  made a DD that I can share if you would like. So , in summary, my strategy would be a very low risk etf, low risk dividend stock/etf and sort of risky stock/etf which you believe will grow faster than your stable and the market in general.

Ok so now for my strategy, what I would do is split your money (not necessarily evenly) between three different stocks/ETFs, so the first one would be your stable stock/ETF, (example VOO)where you just set it and forget it. Next is your dividend one, where it should be sort of stable but with high dividends (example VYM), and now with your new found dividends I'd reinvest back into your stable and the following. The following is what usually is a individual stock, but could be an etf. So the following would be something that you really believe in, something that you think is undervalued and will grow. This doesn't necessarily have to be 100% safe, as you have your stable stock and to a extent your dividend stock to rely on. So an example would be Sony, which is a company I feel really passionate about on which I  made a DD that I can share if you would like. So , in summary, my strategy would be a very low risk etf, low risk dividend stock/etf and sort of risky stock/etf which you believe will grow faster than your stable and the market in general.

128,GME," u/pamdathebear can you help me out with these questions:

I bought 30 GME shares in December 2020, then 35 more in January 2021, sold at a loss in early February 2021 then bought back in late February 2021 and now have a wash sale.

I'm not sure how does this work with taxes, and what would happen if I actually profited this time around and I bought options (calls) while having a wash sale",Seek_Adventur,1,/r/investing/comments/lznoey/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gq4vp4y/,0.057,0.846,0.097,0.4475
129,AAPL," I would recommend 100% VT if you are not at least 95% convinced that the fama-french factor model is a decent model.

Otherwise I would recommend a portfolio with the funds from Avantis.

139,DE," That's not really true in this case.  OP's post is also wrong, but for different reasons.  Of the 5 funds listed one is an index.  Three are managed by the Primecap group, and one is co-managed by Vanguard's quantitative equity group along with DE Shaw and LA Capital.  

So, the takeaway here is that Vanguard's quant-ish fund added this stock because it fit their models.  And the Primecap group, which has a great long term track record but has been somewhat mediocre over the last 2-3 years, is bullish on it.  But Vanguard's actual in house equity managers, which are mostly dogshit by the way, aren't a factor here.",MasterCookSwag,10,/r/investing/comments/lzw10m/vanguard_is_bullish_on_bb/gq4hgvk/,0.033,0.889,0.078,0.795
