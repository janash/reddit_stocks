28,MSGS," HOFV:

* CEO worked at Disney for 13+ years.  This is great experience for someone building a Disney type resort centered around American Football

* Recently partnered with Dolphin Entertainment to work on NFTs for Hall of Fame football players and NFL players

* Launching a fantasy football league this week with big announcements coming on March 30th.

* Getting into sports betting with their fantasy league.  CEO has not said who they may be partnering with but expect a big name, maybe DraftKings

Price speculation - NFTs are very real and we've seen examples of TKAT and other stocks how parabolic the price movement can be.  Expect anywhere from $20 to $50$ in the near future just based on NFT hype.

If you are long term on this, you can expect a price movement within a year similar to MSGS.  

This is a win both short term and long term.  Good luck to everyone.",Brodysseus1,1,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/meq0do/daily_discussion_thread/gslgwo2/,0.0,0.876,0.124,0.961
