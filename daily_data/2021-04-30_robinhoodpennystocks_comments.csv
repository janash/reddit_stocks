4,RH," Yes and no on that ""always negative right away"" part.

I don't use RH so maybe I am missing something, but I use a real broker lol.

When you see a stock trading for 20 dollars, and you put a market order in, you are paying the lowest ""ask"" price. This is the price for you to get into this position.

When you get into that position and suddenly you see red, this is because you are now seeing the ""bid"" price. The stock doesn't have to move at all for you to appear to be red on the position. This is the money you will get to close the position immediately because that is what the best bid price is.

Almost every single position you enter will appear red the moment you buy it, for at least a bit.",MaybeICanOneDay,1,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/n1wn7n/i_know_its_been_stated_before_but/gwgteih/,0.062,0.86,0.078,0.6449
