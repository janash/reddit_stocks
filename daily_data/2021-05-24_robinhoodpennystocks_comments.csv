25,RBBN," Havenâ€™t mentioned it here since itâ€™s a little above penny land but RBBN has a great outlook, solid analyst ratings, and has been steadily climbing for almost the last month. 

Iâ€™ve been really happy with it and I am still buying more, figured someone here may appreciate the heads up $7.36 right now, my average is 6.80 (10 shares lol). It has an equity score on Fidelity of 9.6 which is eye catching I suppose 

Kbnt still going down but just a bit, not too worried. Implore more people to check it out, the same dude (walrus street)that did the dd on ctxr also did a video on this company. He got it at like, $7 or something lol.
