6,ANY," To be fair psychiatry is not an exact science by ANY means. We are still in the super early stages of understanding anything about brain disorders. Most people don’t fit 100% of the criteria of a certain disorder, and most will have overlapping conditions. People with anxiety usually have depression too and vice versa, people with bipolar usually have both, and the list of overlapping things is endless. The DSM criteria are nothing more than a general guideline of how it should be in theory, but in practice often times things are a lot more mixed and nuanced. Most of the time making a correct diagnosis and a correct therapy is much more of a guessing game (based on experience) than anything else. It’s very empirical, it also involves a little bit of luck I’d say. If you go to 10 different psychiatrists the chances they’ll say 10 different things is high, and it could be that none of them is necessarily wrong, it’s just a matter of identifying what’s the main disorder that fueled all the others. I hear them discussing and  having quite different opinion on patients all the time (I study these things). Obviously if you have a little bit of knowledge of the matter you can assess your own situation better than anybody else if you know what to look for, but it’s really hard to get a crystal clear picture.

12,IT," I was in my 40's when I was diagnosed with adult ADHD. When my therapist starting going through symptoms and checking them off so many lightbulbs went off.

I was a great football player because the plays were rehearsed to hell and back, I knew them, I could function without thinking 99% of the time. 

I was a great Marine because everything is structured, from the clothes I wear, to how I eat, to when I shit and how I wipe, everything was structured from my cover to my laces. It was comfortable, I actually enjoyed it and excelled. I enjoyed the tactical planning, preparation, rigid structure punctuated by pure adrenaline moments where my non-stop preparation meant I felt like I was in a movie and able to anticipate actions. 

I got out and got into IT, where again, everything was structured, laid out, massive tomes of instructions for me to pour over, hundreds of hours a month I am left completely alone, just me and the machines that do exactly what I say and only what I say. I can crank my music to deafening levels and no one is around to tell me to turn it down. 

I do digital marketing now. the minutia of data available via trackers and data collection allows me to target from the largest to the smallest demographic at will and I can build and design advertising campaigns that allow me to grow a company and then use the analytics tools to create awesome reports that show growth and profit or how to reach expectations. All of it is data and math, it adds up, it never changes, 2+2 is always 4. 

Now that I know that this love rigid structure may be due to my ADHD and that I can take advantage of it instead of being depressed about my inability to break out of molds and anxiously thinking through every possible conversation I can finally relax a little.

It has been life-changing.

13,IT," I was born into a lower middle class family and when I was 10-12 I taught myself to code from books (first basic, then pascal) and wrote tons of crappy little games on a commodore 64 borrowed from a friend's family.

It's not like it was rocket science or something, it was more an issue of having the desire and ability to focus on a subject many find boring especially when they're young, and autistic people often excel at focusing on their chosen tasks.

>If I lost money one year but gained money the next. My 3k deduction gets applied to the Capital Gains tax first. If I lost 15k in 2019 but made 15k in 2020. My 2020 gains will be taxed as making 12k

If you have a NET loss of 15k in 2019, you take 3k off your taxable income (this is independent of deductions, standard or itemized) and you carry forward the 12k of net loss. In 2020 if you didn't trade at all, you could take another 3k off the loss carried forward and then it would be 9k, etc. etc.

But if you made 15k in 2020 you could use the entire loss carried forward of 12k to offset this, and you would only pay taxes on **3k** of gains.

>Even if I gained in 2021, I can still use the 2020 capital losses to offset all taxable income sources.

Wrong. If you gained in 2021 you would be required to use up your loss carried forward to offset it FIRST before trying to apply it to ordinary income. Capital losses offset gains COMPLETELY and can be carried forward year after year. Capital losses can only be used to offset 3k in  ordinary income, and only if you have a net capital loss for the year.",nocturnaut,14,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n8f30j/got_losses_no_worries_its_just_a_tax_write_off/gxia25q/,0.145,0.764,0.091,-0.926

At the same time, I believe that many Tesla fans overestimate the degree to which Tesla's AI capabilites stand out from the rest. E.g. look at Mercedes, they are definitely not starting from scratch but have some decent experience in that field (invented many of the popular digital safety systems).

Even if they are 3 years ahead in that field: does that REALLY and OBJECTIVELY justify their valuation being higher than the next 10 manufacturers combined?",ChuckMayr,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n8hk1o/tsla_is_basically_an_index_fund_kevin_oleary/gxj56xp/,0.0,0.892,0.108,0.875

Software: Waymos CEO who originally produced the self driving software for Tesla criticized Elon last month for being a pretender and not knowing how to achieve real self driving.

You can do same with bezos.
You're a jack ass. Also pltr has a special structured class f stock for founders. So Alex can sell however he wants without losing voting rights.
Finally he's getting billion dollars in compensation this year. He'll have to pay taxes on it. So he has to sell at least enough to pay IRS and then some more for his lifestyle.

286,AI," >Now tell me why wait 13-14 years to go public?

From what I understand they spent the better half of those 13-14 years doing R&D spending boat loads of money getting the company where it is now ^1 .  They are still spending resources getting their commercial side up and running as well as investing in their sales team, but I think by now they have their core product developed.   

This is probably the earliest they could have gone public.  If they had went public any earlier and were reporting numbers while they were getting the biz off the ground the numbers would have looked like an abortion to WS.

I don’t particularly care that insiders are selling either, but how much of the company do they own?  More or less than an average CEO/insider?  Are they selling to get ownership levels down to an “average” number?  Maybe Karp wants to diversify himself into some of that coin, yo - get a piece of that action.  But what Karp does with his money is none of my business.  Maybe he likes a certain gaming retailer and wants to invest in that 🤷‍♂️

320,MA," >I wouldn't buy anything below the 200-ma and certainly when its below both the 50 and 200.

Every single stock I bought in May 2020 was both below their 50 and 200-day MA. Almost all of them I sold over at 100% profit in less than 2 months. You might say that was a special time. With that logic and if you actually know how a moving average filter actually works, you should know that price of a stock on a random  day in Sep 2019 has an effect on that 50 and 200-day filter curve you see today (on 05/07/2021)! That means all these 50 and 200-day MA curves are severely skewed due to that rapid fall and rise of all these stocks.

>but people much, much smarter, and with a LOT more money, have already put in their bets

Most of the volume we see in stock market is due to trading activities by institutional traders/investors. Some are betting on bullish speculation and some are on bearish speculation. Most of the major stock prices are currently above both 50 and 200-day MA on a yearly chart. Now tell me the people who are betting bearish are less smart and have less money? Go and look at the option open interest on SPY. Billions of dollars are betted on both sides. So, the bearish side is less smart, poor and they do not follow these indicators. Is that what you are trying to say?

>Why would u want to buy a stock below the 200-day MA on the daily, and especially on the weekly?

All these indicators changes their level based on whether a chart is daily, 3 days, 5 days, 10 days, 15 days, monthly, 3 months, 6 months or yearly and so on. The shape of a chart also changes based on the frequency of the data points such as 1 min, 5 mins, hourly etc. play around with the frequency and duration, you get many different charts. All of them are real chart based on true stock price but they all will look different, all the TA indicators will look different. I would not even look at these MA indicators to buy a stock so that question was invalid.

>Use it as a place to enter and exit a trade is all I'm saying

I entered SPY calls this week when SPY was below both 50 and 200-day MA on both daily and weekly chart. I sold them and make profit when SPY was above 50 and 200-day MA. Which is exactly the opposite of you are referring me to do. 

Let me tell you one thing, stock price do not follow any predefined pattern. Once the market closes and the chart is established whether it's a daily or weekly or monthly you can then draw as many pattern as you wish by changing the variable like timeframe and frequency. If a stock price closes above it's 50 and 200 days MA line on both weekly and daily chart. Nobody, I mean nobody in this world can guaranty that that stock price will close higher on the next trading day. Period. A trend is only a trend while it last but the truth is no one knows how long it last. SPY was going up on Wednesday and then it started going down on the same day. What is the trend here up trend? downtrend or dance trend? 

TA does not work, ever. Worked, never with any amount of certainty. Give me one indicator that is only 51% correct but that 51% is consistent. If you can give me that indicator then I will bet $1000 in each trade.

REIT/T stock dividend with a hugely profitable business model, a strong balance sheet, and huge ROE. What's not to like other than that people are unreasonably bearish on the sector, and that UWMC fucking ate Rocket's lunch?

Add to that and the fact that a special dividend, raise in the dividend, or even a stock buyback was mentioned and you've got a recipe for great strides upward.

409,UPC," It is though there is a yearly production shortage of about 35%. The only ones in the world able to produce uranium dirt cheap is Kazakstan and they do not produce nearly enough for even a third! Why do you think Sprott recently aquired UPC and listed a physical uranium trust at preciesly this time? Why do you think miners actually buy uranium instead of selling It? Why do you think instutional money have been POURING into the sector this year (look up the 50 day rolling average, this is not some retail craze. Most people are as narrow minded as you)? Global demand cannot be met for a spotprice of under 60$, thats a double from now. Mines arent inking term contracts due to being lowballed. Most good mines are debt free due to institutional funding. Even in the most bearish scenario that every reactor is turned off (its not though, its a slowly growing industry. Look up reactors coming online vs offline on world nuclear) that amounts for 10% of the Global electric grid. Something has to replace that right and the probability is high for gas, now that requires some infrastructure which requires time and money and guess what? Keeping the plants open and buying expensive uranium is a hell of a lot cheaper during the transition than importing electricity and in that scenario its still not enough uranium for a phase out! Uranium is a contrarian investors wet dream since people underplay how large nuclear is and how much electricity comes from it and a lot of people dont like the idea of nuclear or even the thought of it! But that doesnt mean its not a good investment, even more so beacuse there is people like you that root against it or are missinformed so a lot of people wont even see it coming.",Riflebursdoe,12,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n89hly/uranium_is_the_future/gxhlqjn/,0.058,0.895,0.047,0.5226

CLOV has no margin on what they sell currently, so they lose even more money than a normal growth company. They also can't grow their way to profitability.

626,FB," From what I've read about online advertising, it's not actually all that clear that targeted advertising even works. When it does work, it's often only marginally better than sending the ad to everyone. There's been a ton of studies on this over the years to back this up, targeted advertising is something that should make a huge difference in theory but in practice it almost always doesn't. The advertisers seem to believe it works however and might reduce their ad spend if they can't target their ads as much, which could be significant, but I don't think conversion rates are actually going to take anywhere near as much of a hit as people think they will.

Also bear in mind, this AFAIK is only on tracking cookies (might be wrong), which is 1 of the primary sources of information they use to build a profile on you. Facebook can still build a decent profile with their other sources (FB/Insta/Sites with FB login activity), just not as well, as tracking cookies previously allowed them to see your activity on the rest of the internet.

Remember this doesn't just affect FB. This could actually strengthen FB's position relative to other platforms. Since advertising platforms can only now collect from within their walled garden of apps/sites, the platform with the biggest garden is now in a much better position relative to a lot of their smaller competitors. So while the pie might get revised smaller, FB could get a higher % of that pie.

Given these points I expect the market to overreact here. If there's a big dip for FB in the coming weeks, I would bet on a sizeable rebound when it turns out to be relatively minor.",BigDollopEnergy,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n8hmcr/how_deep_will_ios_tracking_ban_tank_fb/gxiy6ed/,0.017,0.934,0.049,0.796

888,GME," Yes at least during the January squeeze I Fomo’d into GME $115C at avg price of $10 per contract during the $60->$90 run on Monday and was able to sell at $30,000 per contract mid week. Same with amc which I was lucky to have $7Calls when the price was 5 at $0.50 or so per contract and ended up selling for about $10. 

However, that was January and you’re talking $500 for GME and $20 for amc. 

I asked the same question a bit ago and the responses were mixed. If GME is in the hundreds of thousands one person said they might sell your contracts for you ? But again, your contracts at least guarantee a ceiling per share for the person who wants to exercise them (perhaps to cover) so buying at market price to cover which could be ever increasing every minute vs buying the premium and exercising at $800 per share seems like the same thing. I’m of the opinion it should fill. 

Buying 100 shares vs buying a contract when the underlying is that high should be the same cost. So $$ wise it would make no difference to the buyer, but at least it guarantees 100 shares at a time. I also think sellers of contracts would have an incentive to sell vs straight shares because there is an expiration and they would fear drastic fluctuations of price if they wait too long. The $115 calls went from $1k -> $800-> $400 -> $5k -> $35k -> $15k by Friday Jan 29. And those are huge differences. 

The thing is the spread might be thousands or tens of thousands of dollars difference so it’ll be really interesting to see if people are willing to wait for ask prices to fill or just put in the bid to guarantee the sale. 

I think buyers will purposefully put in lower bids to get a discount on calls and at astronomical prices sellers might just say fuck it I’m seeing 6 digits 7 digits per contract I’ll live and let me take my profits.

If there are lots of halts and peaks and valleys people who hold contracts could fear a dip before expiration and try to exit earlier than a position with shares. But if you hold many, selling 1 or 2 contracts might just do you in with enough cash to exercise 2 others. 

If share buying is restricted then the only way to keep riding it up past expiration may be exercise and trust it goes much higher. This has just never happened before so I’m not sure there is too much precedent to look to.

Also know that that is the job of the market maker to fill the order if you set your price to the bid price. So the market is buying from you there doesn’t necessarily have to be an individual buyer. Now if the market maker goes under and can’t fulfill the duties ...",TheInternetTrader,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n7ytjf/options_prices_during_a_short_squeeze/gxibd76/,0.047,0.839,0.114,0.9857
889,ANY," It’s rare that you would run into a negative premium situation no matter how deep you are in the money.  Worst case you will always get at least intrinsic value, as the MM on the other end will buy your call at that price to reduce their outstanding exposure.  Even if premium went negative , it wouldnt be more than a few cents as the MM would pick it up right away and then sell 100 shares against for a quick small profit.  The markets are too efficient.  The spreads will be ugly though, and it may be difficult to capture ANY premium from your contract.

892,GME," You are now getting everyone confused.

When GME was trading at $300, the $30 strike call would be worth $270 at the expiry (the buyer, if there was one, would pay $27,000 for that 1 call). A few days out, the price would be different. At the share price of $270, that call would be worth $240 at the expiry, i.e. $24,000 in actual money. 

However, it is worth how much someone is willing to pay for it at any given time. You will never sell one for more than the highest bid. You also do not want your calls expire in the money if you do not intend on owning the stock or don’t have the money to pay for it (depending on your broker, they may liquidate your contracts before the expiry with an automatic market order if you don’t have sufficient funds in your account to exercise the calls).

893,GME," Yes.  For example if GME was at $300, the buyer of the $30 call could offer me like only $25,000 and immediately cash it in for $30,000.

**Microsoft:** founded in 1975 and CEO sold his 1st share in 2003. After 28 years 

**Tesla:** founded in 2003 and CEO sold his 1st share in 2010. After 07 years but he bought back all shares within one year. He sold some in 2016 but his net purchase is more than he sold. Basically he sold nothing.

**Amazon:** Founded in 1994 and CEO sold his 1st share in 2003. Keep in mind when Bezos sold his 1st share in 2003, Amazon was already profitable by that time and this is very important.

**Apple:** Founded in 1976. Steve Jobs resigned in 1985 and only then he sold his AAPL stocks. When he came back later and granted stocks/options in 2001, he did not sell a single stock ever. He died but did not sell those stocks.

 **Spotify:** Founded in 2006. Neither CEO nor any other insiders sold a single share till today in 15 years.

**Slack Technologies:** Founded in 2009. Neither CEO nor any other insiders sold a single share till today in 12 years.

**Roblox Corporation:** Founded in 2004. Neither CEO nor any other insiders sold a single share till today in 17 years.

**Coinbase:** Founded in 2012. Neither CEO nor any other insiders sold a single share till today in 9 years.
