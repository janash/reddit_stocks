1,JP," BlackRock's avg. share price is $23.42 and would be interesting to see at what price they sold those 24 million shares.

Here are some other big institutional investors and their avg. price:

Vanguard Group - $16.52  
JP Morgan - $11.78  


Edit: not sure how accurate this information is... on the Fintel website a lot of institutional investors are coming with an $16.52 avg price which looks weird.",Noir-21,172,/r/investing/comments/n7z2b6/blackrock_reports_71_decrease_in_ownership_of_pltr/gxfkzfm/,0.051,0.814,0.135,0.7159

5,PLTR," My 2 cents. Look at where Palantir was in 2015 from the valuation standpoint and see where it was right before the listing.

Guess what, the valuation hasn't changed in 5 years.   They got into the meme stock hype and I guess the early investors recognized that they are at the peak and started selling at the top.

25,AI," They are a big $1.3bn turnover company with a valuation of $37bn. Their main USP is that they appear to be running the US DoD's OS, so they're pretty safe from hackers. For any company nowadays that's a pretty wide moat. And for a 17-year old company which has never turned a profit a moat is a good thing. 

If the company can sustain 30% growth for another 5 years then current valuations would put it at 10x sales, which is OK., but if they don't turn a profit after all the happy noises coming out of Palantir this past quarter I can't see people hanging around that long.

They say they're snowed under, they've captured IBM's AI customer base, they have masses of new big clients, and now they're offering their services to any company for free...they were close to profitability last Q, blaming the shortfall on one-time float expenses, but their staff remuneration is higher than their annual turnover!

54,PLTR," I've commented before on why I thought PLTR was massively overvalued (when it was around $30 for reference, although it's still overvalued IMO). 

First of all, I have no doubt that Palantir has developed a good quality product. However, they've been developing for 10 years and there is still no widespread use of the platform. Their sales numbers are severely lacking behind the valuation of the stock. I believe that's because their software is primarily aimed towards a niche, namely a type of OSINT software that is useful for intelligence agencies. They have a price to sales ratio in the 30s right now (used to be 50 even), which is extremely high, even for tech. They're not profitable yet either.

The stock price of Palantir has show huge growth since ICO, but their financials haven't reflected that yet. Sure they've gotten a lot of new contracts in the last months, but that has been a couple of million here and a couple of million there, it's not enough to make a difference. There are analytics companies that are getting contracts like these on the daily, but it's not news for them, the fact that a company worth 10s of billions is celebrating a contract for a couple of million says enough.",redderper,2,/r/investing/comments/n7z2b6/blackrock_reports_71_decrease_in_ownership_of_pltr/gxiovex/,0.04,0.853,0.107,0.9365

When it cut loose it blew so far past both that any time related premiums evaporated and it ended up being almost a straight ""current value"" exchange.

Honestly I'm totally OK with that loss. It hurt for sure at the time, but if I hadn't written spreads I would have been down $15k minimum, or more than $20k if I had chosen to hold the shares I wrote for as of Friday's close.

94,MSCI," While using cash as risk protection is a valid strategy — cash is an asset class, just like equities and bonds — I recommend watching the [latest Rational Reminder episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXo3c7sEiQA) about how ""buying the dip"" does not work. They also published [a whitepaper](https://www.pwlcapital.com/resources/buy-the-dip/) that goes into more detail:

> **The perceived attractiveness of “buying the dip” may become particularly pronounced when the stock market appears to be expensive based on measures like the Shiller price earnings ratio, or the market index reaching new all-time highs.** [...] While it seems appealing to “buy the dip”, the strategy implies that available capital is sitting idle while waiting for the right time to invest. This implication raises an important question about opportunity costs. Does the opportunity cost of waiting for a drop outweigh the perceived benefit of buying low? In this paper we set out to answer that question by testing “buy the dip” strategies in six individual country stock indexes, the MSCI World index, and the MSCI World ex-US index. We find no compelling evidence in favor of waiting for market drops to invest. **Instead, we find that “buying the dip” is a sub-optimal strategy in both normal times and when the market appears expensive. On average, “buying the dip” trails investing a lump sum by a wide margin over 10-year periods**.

In other words, setting aside cash to deploy in a downmarket will not improve your returns. Further, lump sum investing beats DCA in almost all time periods (""time in the market beats timing the market""), purely in terms of returns.",lobster_johnson,1,/r/investing/comments/n8h5gu/asset_valuations_how_are_you_protecting_yourself/gxja94z/,0.04,0.851,0.109,0.9521

This might not be true for airlines and cruise lines that were hit especially hard by the pandemic, but any company that weathered the pandemic is now trading at a much higher multiple to earnings than it was trading at prior to the pandemic. Take a look at Tesla, Apple, Amazon, UPS, Walmart, McDonald's,... The list goes on and on. And you can just look at the major indexes as well. The s&p 500, NASDAQ, and Dow are all at record highs.

I believe that the reason why stocks are trading at so much higher multiples, despite the fact that they're earnings have not increased that amount, is due to all of the free money printing from the Fed.

111,DCF," If you really want to get technical, I do a “football” valuation including a DCF and comps with multiple metrics. Each metric has its pros and downsides and using only one is not smart.

EV / EBITDA shouldn’t be used in isolation. It’s purpose isn’t to determine underlying cashflow, but as a comparable multiple similar to EV / sales. The advantage of EBITDA is it is more consistent than say operating cashflow or PE, and you’re valuing companies, you should inherently know that it excludes ITDA and factor that it by paying a lower multiple than a metric which includes them. That’s why I often look at EBITDA - capex when valuing businesses.  

Downsides of:
- DCF: based on many underlying subjective assumptions. If assumptions are wrong, valuation will be wrong. Also Inherently weights risk. This will lead you to taking less risk in portfolio (and achieving a lower return) over time (if you subscribe to CAPM that is)
- PE: doesn’t reflect underlying cashlfow. Often can be gamed by companies marking up or down assets and liabilities. When trump put his tax plan into law, reducing taxes, for example, it caused companies to record charges to P&L for DTAs despite taxes going down. If biden increases corporate taxes, the DTAs will be worth more, leading to non cash write ups, despite companies having to pay more tax in the future.

112,DCF," >If you really want to get technical, I do a “football” valuation including a DCF and comps with multiple metrics.

Ok? That's ... not particularly technical, nor out of the ordinary.  It's typical for M&A or other investment analyses, forecasts, etc., to triangulate using multiple models, and to weight them according to their different probabilities.

>This will lead you to taking less risk in portfolio (and achieving a lower return) over time (if you subscribe to CAPM that is).

This is a rather generic sentiment that echoes what has been said elsewhere (almost word for word...), but it doesn't answer my question.  The issue with CAPM is beta... but keeping in mind that this is why Graham espouses a margin of safety in all investments:

*Why would buying a dollar for sixty cents (or even less, if our fair value estimate is ""more conservative"") be more risk for less reward than buying sixty cents for a dollar?*   Isn't your answer to the latter going to be dependent on speculation about future events not present value?  How is that less risky?

(Full disclosure: I'm a corporate finance analyst in tech. I'm looking for a level of thought in your answer that I can't find simply by looking in a textbook.)

P.S. Re: Operating cash flow... yes but we would know immediately if they were gaming working capital by looking at the changes in inventory vs. depreciation expense, and we could adjust for that.

139,USA," Yes, you'll need to pay taxes on any gain that's not tax-protected. Assuming you're in the USA. Other nations have certain percentages that aren't taxed.

But consult a tax guide, or just import all your brokerage forms at tax time into a good software. Anything you've gained THIS year will be paid next year (unless you owe quarterly taxes, again consult a pro if necessary). 

The other thing to remember is that if you can hold a stock for over a year, you are taxed at the long-term capital gains tax when you sell. If you're married that means if your total income is below 80,000 (including gains from the sale) you won't pay taxes on it. The limit is 40,000 if you're single.

So by carefully planning how/when you sell stocks, you can avoid some tax burden (or at least lower it). 

But again, most tax software is rather good at this these days, so I'd just load up all your brokerage forms in one and see what it says.

141,UK," As opposed to choosing a stock which produces a product, i would be more inclined to go with companies like walmart, suppliers and chains. At least for the next 5-10 years. They're a safe bet because they aren't going to be out done by any other company any time soon.

I'm just very conscious about how easy it is to diminish one product. Look at the coca cola classic, one product that in the UK got slapped with like an extra 40pence sugar tax on it for every drink you buy. Over the years they have blundered changing the recipe. Been forced to come up with new products such as diet coke and diet zero sugar as well as no caffeine and other flavored products (adapt or die). Or what if the supply for one of their key ingredients dries up for whatever reason.

When you are investing in a company that generates a large portion of their profit from one single product, i am very cautious about investing in it for the long term. Because right now that product is vulnerable to anything from supply issues to government policy. If you were going to invest for 10-20 years, why not buy a company like walmart that has actually grown in the past 5 years rather than produce a dividend. Or find a company like At&T that will grow and produce a dividend.

I think the problem for me with cocacola is that it is more of an anchor than a portfolio hedge at this point. Its something that you can sell to investors who just want to make their 5% back every year.

156,CB," >  While I understand, if banks need to take losses on assets and continue operations, they can fall back on their retained earnings, which in a way helps buffer the losses since all these earnings are the net income accumulated over the years of operation. But can banks use their own shares for this purpose? Essentially, the question is, how can banks use their own shares to protect themselves from asset loss? How do shares play that role? Honestly I think I'm carrying one big misunderstanding somewhere, and hope someone can shed some light into it.

So the whole idea of CET1 is that it's capital the bank's investors stand to lose.  That's usually equity, but also any earnings they're entitled to which is why retained earnings and AOCI get lumped in there.  In practice when banks need to raise CET1 capital they'll just issue preferred shares of some type which pay a fixed coupon to limit the overall cost of that capital.  Regulators just want some additional buffer between bank losses and depositors or counterparties potentially taking losses here.

> But why is this considered into the equation? Will these assets (deposits at the Fed) have a risk of being lost if the Fed is somehow unable to return them?? If yes, what situation will it be where the Fed cannot return the deposits? If no, why is it part of the SLR equation, and why is there a need to hold capital against it?

So this is an area that's kind of under active review and consideration.  What happened is that after 2008 a lot of the structured securities that were considered AAA like CDOs turned out not to be that low risk, so SLR emerged as this all encompassing leverage ratio where all assets were considered risky to some degree, even if it didn't make logical sense that actually could default (treasuries and CB deposits can't/won't really ever default in practice).  That's part of what the Fed is supposed to be reviewing going forward in terms of capital requirements for those holdings.

> When the expiry was drawing near, and as banks were lobbying the Fed to extend this SLR change, one of the reasons I saw was that banks would have to ""decrease deposits (pushing savers out of holding deposits)"", essentially meaning turning away people who want to deposit money with the bank. Why would reverting the change mean that banks have to turn away deposits?

Because banks have to do something with the money they get in deposits while they're holding them.  Ideally they would lend it back out but there's been a huge increase in deposits without a big increase in qualified borrowers during the pandemic so they have to put that money somewhere else.  That typically means those deposits end up short duration treasuries and banks are already holding a huge amount of excess reserves at the Fed due to QE too.  Additionally rates were extremely low and close to zero, so what that means is there's basically no money being earned on those two piles of money but they also have to post CET1 capital to meet SLR.  Well CET1 capital isn't cheap, so you have banks that might need to raise a few hundred million in preferreds yielding 5% to cover new deposits.  So at a 5% SLR requirement for that capital yielding 5% on that capital they need an offsetting yield of 0.25% on whatever the deposits are invested in to break even, that's assuming they're paying depositors nothing too, which they usually aren't.  Meanwhile a 52-week T-bill is yielding around 0.07% so the math doesn't add up and it starts effectively costing banks money to take on more deposits.

> After the expiry of the change, the fear that banks would now have to sell treasury bonds to meet SLR requirements (and cause a rise in yields that would hamper economic recovery) did not materialize. Instead, it was reported that banks were raising cash by issuing debt. This would imply that this increases their core capital. Why is this possible when cash is not included in the definition of core capital? After all, this also has a net neutral effect on their balance sheet, since the increase in cash will be offset by an increase in liabilities to their creditors.

You can't meet CET1 capital requirements by raising debt.  If anything they issued preferreds but most of the big banks well enough aware that the waiver was temporary that they weren't in any immediate risk when it rolled off.  The other risk involved with all this is that institutional deposits that banks were turning away would just end up in money market funds and push rates down below zero which again didn't really materialize since that's largely what banks were doing with the money anyways and institutional depositors don't need to post CET1 themselves so they don't have the same kind of yield floor concerns.",ObservationalHumor,2,/r/investing/comments/n8fpef/understanding_the_supplementary_leverage_ratio_slr/gxid4ln/,0.07,0.825,0.105,0.9806

158,USA," Hello! I'm looking on advice on how to get started in investing.

I'm 24 living in the USA, im self employed with the business continuing to grow so my income is a bit unpredictable, if we keep going at the rate we are it should be about 60k+ per year.

My objectives with this money is to have my money make more money for me over a long period as well as use some of the earnings to buy a house within the next 2 to 4 years. In colorado where I'm at houses are around the 500k mark. I plan to build and sell a tiny house as well to generate a good chunk of change for the down payment. The house would be my highest priority as rent is my highest expense right now, I plan to buy a 3 bedroom and rent out 2 to lower the mortgage payment for me.

As far as risk tolerance I'm not a gambling type of person but from what I do know the higher the risk the higher the reward, I dont need to know its 100 percent safe but would like it to be on the safer side of things if that makes sense.

My current holdings include a Roth Ira that I opened 2 years ago as well as a money market account. Money market account i put 50 a month into and currently has a 3.09% return and I currently put $100 a month into the ira. As the business grows and my income as well I plan to put more in a month.

My current debts include student loans totaling about 10k and a car loan that totals $5600 with an interest rate of somewhere around 7 percent If I remember right. I plan to pay the car off hopefully buy the end of 2021.

Generally other than the two accounts above most of my money stays in my checking account.
