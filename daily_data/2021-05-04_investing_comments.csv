People still don’t understand Tesla’s business model though. It’s not a race to manufacturing dominance for them. Tesla is a data/tech company first and foremost, that just happens to use cars to get it out in to the public. They will eventually hold a small market share comparably and be the most profitable of manufacturers through subscriptions and licensing of their software. No one is even close to Tesla on their software tech, with the next closest being Google.

Toyota builds \~10 Million cars per year.   
Tsla ? about 1 million.   


if they do not significantly scale up their production capacity, they simply will not be able to keep up with demand to be a real major player in the EV market. 

the only reason they lead the pack currently is the sad fact that their is simply no ecomomical need to switch to complete EV / BEV production for the traditional companies.

They also think Tesla is only a carmaker. They obviously aren’t, even if most of their profit comes from cars. This sub then memes that statement, without providing a valid reason why they’re only a car company. Reading into company work culture, it’s clear they’ve structured themselves like a Silicon Valley company, and not a Detroit or German car maker company. As Elon said on the most recent earnings call, they’re expanding heavily and are already entrenched into AI and neural networks, which matches Silicon Valley companies. People buy stocks based on future potential, and not what’s happened over the past year, which is what this sub does. Tesla is a leader in solar, autonomy, grid storage and car power trains. Even if their profit doesn’t come primarily from the first 3, it’s the potential that’s leads institutional investors and some retail to invest in.

This is how Amazon operated for years.  They can under price their competition and potentially take 0 or even slightly negative margin to gain marketshare and investors will love it.  

Their traditional competitors on the other hand are going to likely be experiencing slower sales and will need to show margin to keep wall street somewhat happy.  

Also, historically there hasn't been much difference between manufacturers.  It didn't really matter if you bought a ford or gm.  There was personal preference but you could do the same things in either.  

With the era of self driving approaching and the need for fast charging networks, suddenly Tesla has an even bigger advantage.  Yes competitors will work on catching up as they will have to.

30,GM," I don't buy the argument that the other automakers are giving 100%.   They are giving marketing the 100% treatment, but not the supply chain.  For example, while GM is targeting 30 new BEV by 2025, the volume of BEV that they expect to produce is only 250,000 total units.

[When forecasting sales of just GM’s expected 18 passenger and light commercial EV models in the US (including models from Cruise and BrightDrop, but not Honda/Acura or Navistar), the company would reach sales of less than 250,000 by 2025. And because many of these models would be higher-end GMC and Cadillac models, the overall average volume per model comes out to less than 13,400.](https://evadoption.com/what-does-gms-30-new-evs-by-2025-promise-mean-for-the-us-market/)

For reference, 250,000 units is the low-end growth target for Tesla in 2021. By 2025, Tesla will likely produce and sell 10-20x this number of vehicles. (2.5-5.0 million units)",gratefulturkey,8,/r/investing/comments/n4ifxt/q1_2021_tesla_market_share_is_shrinking/gwwvqnd/,0.0,0.924,0.076,0.7945

According to the blogpost that OP has based their post on. The main reason Tesla has lost some market share is because of SAIC selling a lot of cars.

You are right in another way though, Tesla vehicles offer a lot for of value for money, more so than any other vehicles on the market, IMO.

Waymo uses both vision and lidar, tesla only uses lidar. we still don't even know how tesla stores all the data and information it captures. Tesla trying to use a neural net for full self driving is a fools errand. Computers don't work the same way in processing as humans do. There is a reason that waymo is using lidar.

I imagine there will be some massive profit taking on these growthy bubbles due to fears of rate rising and CG tax increase.

On a side note: moderate inflation >>> moderate short term deflation >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Hyper-deflation/inflation

The risk of a bit hotter inflation is still better than the risk of prolonged deflation. Also I don't think periodic deflation is such a big a threat as it's spoken out to be. It's persistent deflation that is a concern and the fed has made a lot of moves to deal with that. ATM we are at no risk of deflation with many outside the Fed/Treasury/DC saying we're on the hot side of inflation.

Back to Japan. Their decades long econ stagnation + deflation was due to more than just the policy of their central bank, but rather population. The bank and government can encourage, damper, and influence their people and economy. But there are limits to what and how much a government can do as well as how fast their policies can be implemented (to varying effectiveness btw). At the end of the day it all means nothing if a COUNTRY it's POPULACE isn't generating real economic growth and real GDP. [Japan's population metrics ](https://np.worldometers.info/world-population/japan-population/#:~:text=The%20median%20age%20in%20Japan%20is%2048.4%20years.) has had a larger impact than their government: low national reproduction, low inward migration, and rapidly aging median population. The asset bubble, crash, and economic decline only further compounded the population woes as Japanese youth declined to have more children while burdened with poor economic prospects causing a downward spiral. The government certainly didn't help by not tampering down harder on their bubble, made the pop/demographics worse by limiting immigration, and not encouraging building families until more recent years [(it's funny for weebs tho)](https://np.reddit.com/r/tumblr/comments/jjjbke/now_shinzo_abe_has_one_way_left_to_raise_japans/).

If we look at the US policies then they specifically target many of the areas which would cause a Japan-style stagnation+deflation:

* Targeted declined in unemployment

* Verbal commitment to keep interest rate status quo until normalized employment rate 

* Letting inflation run hot to avoid deflation (also cuts down on our debt)

* Biden's plan focuses on families with a lot of schooling support, tax breaks, and money

* Biden has increased immigration cap

* A permanent one-time hike in inflation might encourage the asset wealthy to rejoin the workforce. IMO narrative creators or ""trad media"" seem to fear inflation because it impacts the elderly who consume it. Inflation is a lot less scary for a little zoomer with no assets, tons of school debt, and looking for their first job as wages are hiked by inflation. However, it might hurt a boomer who's looking at retirement, invested in bonds, or older retirement-oriented boomer company that might have trouble raising prices enough to increase dividends at a rate that off-sets inflation (AT&T) because they are getting disrupted by newer companies (NFLX). This might strangely encourage older 45-70yr Americans planning retirement to go back into the workforce a bit longer once they realize a $1M retirement portfolio isn't as secure post-pandemic when lumber 1000x and they can't build a porch without liquidating 10% their portfolio.

Note that I'm not saying I agree with everything the US government has and is doing. The US has a lot of it's own problems which are very different. I'm just noting that the if you look at the moves that they have made. You can see that the economic heads have taken policies that would make a Japan-style deflation situation very unlikely.

96,CG," I can't say with certainty that they will.  All I know is people price in what they expect to happen and right now there are two things on wealthy investors minds:
1) feds target inflation and rates to match it
2) capital gains increase
If you want to protect capital both lead me to believe this year will be 'sell growth in may and go away'.  Worse case scenario is you hold 300% capital gains in some no profit growth stock, rates rise so growth stock valuation gets cut in half and CG rise so you pay more taxes on whatever your profits are left when you sell.  This is double whammy and no person with significant investments wants to be in this situation.  When rates finally rise (if they do) it will be a non-event because anybody with a wealth advisor already priced it in and acted accordingly this year.

IMO, Crypto market is trying to mature, but there's still a ton of speculative money greedily jumping in, then nervously jumping out again. If/when the market does mature, that oscillation should dampen a bit, and then we might see how it will fit into overall portfolios long term (assuming it survives at all :P)

If nothing else, I'm fairly sure when bear market hits crypto again, there's still gonna be on-chain demand to borrow for trading & derivatives. So DeFi lending rates will probably remain reasonably competitive, meaning lending out stablecoins during a bear might actually be a good crypto-related play, regardless of how the crypto market itself reacts.",ryebit,2,/r/investing/comments/n4jrd3/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/gwws66a/,0.088,0.76,0.153,0.8847

171,AMZN," A couple of years ago I bought an apartment under construction, which will be delivered this year - I have already paid 20% of its value.

I'm 32 years old and I've been basically putting my savings in a bank account for the last 9 years (since I started working) - not too wise I know :D

I haven't really been into investing until last year, when I started following a bogleheads approach and also playing around with some stocks.

Now I have to pay the remaining 80% and I'm considering two options:

1. Pay it with my savings, I`d keep ~10k€ in my bank account. Then start investing monthly with most of my salary savings (~2k/month to index funds + stocks)
2. Get a 30y mortgage, in my country current fixed interest rates are around ~1,5% (french amortization method). Invest most of my current savings right now. Keep investing monthly savings (~1,6k/month).

I guess financially it would be better the second option as long as you get a higher return from your investments than the mortgage interests but on the other hand, it must feel nice knowing that you have no debts and your basic needs almost covered... 

In the second scenario, my intention would be to add half of my savings to my current Vanguard Index funds, and the other half to  APPL, MSFT, AMZN, GOOGL to basically buy&hold for a long period.

176,IMO," congratulations on the position you have put yourself in!  you have a lot of flexibility,  Assuming all the other blocking and tackling is covered (emergency fund and what not).

IMO, how much risk you take on should be directly correlated to the amount of time you want to spend paying attention to your investment positions.  If you want to be super hands off, rebalancing yearly, then broad market is the way to go at your age.  If you are happy with the idea of fiddling with your investments a lot more often and tracking targets on them, you can take on much more risk.

The simplest way to start is to have a core holding which today for you is basically broad world with a strong US overweight and large cap overweight.  There is nothing generally wrong with that.  Then the question is how much of it % do I want to use to try to beat the market.  Then where do I do that and what do I buy.

ETFs come in all sorts of designer colors these days, and I think it is simplest to build overweight out of the market's best performing sectors... this stage you can look at tech and consumer discretionary, again, how much time and effort you want to put in matters.

If you speculate (IMO crypto is currency speculation, not an investment), do it with small amounts.  There is nothing wrong with speculation, it just deserves constant watching.

This is pretty general, but TL;DR yes, if you start overweighting your portfolio with some higher performing things it should help you with the stated goals.  happy returns!",LiqCourage,1,/r/investing/comments/n4jqq6/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gwxkl0z/,0.035,0.834,0.131,0.9738

179,GNRC," Nothing much. GNRC isn't cheap, but that was a very good quarter the other day and the company can't keep up with very strong demand as is - if it's a moderately active hurricane season, more demand on top of it. So not ""on sale"", but getting sold off while facing tremendous demand for the products for the foreseeable future.

""Before discussing our first quarter results in more detail, I'd like to spend a few minutes on the major outage event that occurred in Texas in mid-February. This was a very unique winter event with unusually cold weather in a state that represents our second largest addressable market opportunity for home standby generators and highlighted yet another example of the vulnerabilities of the current electrical utility model. This was a high-profile power outage.

In fact, the fifth largest event recorded since we began tracking outages more than a decade ago, with rolling blackouts across the state that lasted for several days and impacted over 4.5 million utility customers at its peak. With the backdrop of the ongoing Home as a Sanctuary trend, we believe the outage in Texas was a dramatic reminder of the pain of losing power in today's day and age and further amplify the importance of having power security for your home or your business. Driven by this event, we experienced yet another dramatic acceleration in demand for home standby generators from the already elevated levels, increasing our lead times to approximately 28 weeks for our most popular models as of today. As a result, we have further increased our capacity expansion plans for home standby as we target even higher production levels in the second half of the year through a faster ramp of our New South Carolina facility and further expansion of capacity at our Wisconsin facilities.

When combined with the broad-based strengthening of demand across the rest of our business, including a significant recovery in C&I products, which are also benefiting from the major Texas event, we are significantly increasing our full year revenue and earnings outlook for 2021. 

The outlook for C&I products has also improved considerably with a significant pickup demand for telecom national account customers, stronger outlook for domestic industrial distributors, traction with certain projects and beyond standby applications, a further recovery in demand for mobile products and an improved outlook for C&I products within the international markets. As a result of these incrementally positive end market trends, we are increasing our full year 2020 net sales guidance to now be approximately 40% to 45% growth compared to the prior year, which includes only approximately 2% of favorable impact from acquisitions and foreign currency. This is an increase from the previous as reported guidance of 25% to 30%. At the midpoint of the range, this updated sales growth guidance would result in a year-over-year increase in net sales of over $1 billion. This revenue outlook now assumes shipments of residential products increased at a very robust rate of over 50% as compared to the prior year. Revenue for C&I products is now expected to rebound at an even stronger rate as compared to the softer prior year comparison, a rate approximately in the mid-20% range.""

180,IMO," If you want to make your Roth literally fire and forget, you can pick a broad market global fund; since you mentioned Vanguard funds, that would be VT.  you don't even have to rebalance that annually since it does itself.  If you want to manage the investments in your Roth, $QQQ is great while this market cycle persists, once the bull ends, it will definitely need to be changed.  Simplification (less funds) is good, IMO.

As to diversifying your portfolio, if you don't have your own targets for the members of your portfolio, it is hard for you to decide whether to buy, sell or hold.  I'd suggest building the core of your portfolio out of something diverse and global (VTI/VXUS or just VT) and then decide what % you want to allocate to other things.  those other things can be ETFs as overweights that are working in the current market cycle like tech, or individual stocks.  The more risk you take on the more time you should expect to have to put in to managing the risk.

Crypto should be treated as speculative currency investment, and all things speculative deserve weekly watching/management.

207,TSLA," Thanks for some support!  It's a bit discouraging to see such quick dismissal of my comments.  I've been lurking for a while in this sub but this is my first post, and it's not a great welcome.

I am working on updating my spreadsheet to go back a few years to further test my hypothesis.  I will start in the year 2005, using data starting in 2000.  At the end of each year, I will look at the recent 3-year and 5-year returns (and 10-year once I get to 2010) and choose the top performers in each sector.  I will compare the performance of these 20 stocks (weighted 5% each) against the S&P return for that year.   I will then repeat the process for the next year, as I would re-evaluate the set of 20 stocks annually.

It won't be a perfect analysis for a few reasons.  I am starting with the S&P 100 companies as of today, so it includes companies that reached that market cap in the middle of my time span, and excludes companies that dropped out.  TSLA, for example, wouldn't be on the radar until it's market cap was in the top 100.  It also assumes the approximate sector weighting we have today (e.g. I have 4 information technology stocks but only 2 from industrials) and that has also changed over the past 20 years.",andrwsc,1,/r/investing/comments/n4ggw4/index_funds_or_stock_portfolio/gwyawd6/,0.067,0.89,0.043,-0.81

My two cents: no, not necessarily. Hence the adage which you you seem well aware of. It is perfectly possible that your hypothetical portfolio will continue to beat a good index fund in the coming years, but it might not.

The figure I saw was Apple accounted for 3% of revenue. Not that big of a deal. However the M1 itself is concerning, it shows ARM can meet or beat x86. However its also a special situation, Apple has more money than god, and poached talent from every top semi, the more important factor though, is Apple has a cult like brand, they can convince developers to willingly create ARM versions of their apps. On the Windows side, that was an utter failure with Surface RT, and most companies are not going to want to redevelop software, external or internal for ARM, unless they are HUGELY incentivized to do so.

>failed to keep up with the shrinking node trends, currently struggling to produce 10nm chips while others are working on 3nm

Yes, this is obviously a sore spot and still a concern going forward. 7nm is like 5 years late, its not good by any means. 10nm had bad yields and wasnt ready for prime time at launch a few years ago either. However 10nm is literally in mass production right now for Alder Lake, which is a big launch, not a niche product, this is its prime time. And I shouldnt have to explain this to people, but Intel 10nm is equivalent to TSMC 7nm, which is what AMD is currently using. 7nm was reiterated to be on track for 2023 by Pat last week during the earnings call. Intel has historically given us bad time frames, but I can only go with what is said and known. By late 2022 AMD will be on 5nm, so once again, node parity is coming.

>while others are working on 3nm

This is TSMC for Apple first for next year. Nobody else is at that level, There are only 3 leading edge fabs, TSMC, INTC, Samsung. Samsung being the worst of the 3 and expected to actually fall behind Intel when Intel gets to 7nm.


>and has even been overtaken by AMD

Yes, but caveats. AMD has the node advantage for similar products right now, that changes with Alder Lake (later this year), and AMD really only beats Intel in highly threaded applications, like Blender, anythings that maxes out under 8c/16t, like video games, daily use, is a wash. Credit to AMD for catching up, but its not like they are years ahead of Intel. Also this is just at the high performance end, marketshare wise, as of Q1 Intel has 80% marketshare of CPU sales, so despite their slipping high performance consumer CPUs, and some data center, they still dominate in sales.


>Intel finally sees the need to fight back, and the two fabs in Arizona, due 2024, at the cost of $20B is the latest strategy. However, it is a risky strategy. Adding fabs to the business is not just a one-time cost of the $20B but requires consistent upkeep and upgrade costs, something more like $20B per year, which, over the coming decade, would be more than Intel’s total current equity. Intel is thus further adding operational costs to its business during a time when the company is expected to see shrinking revenue and earnings. Typically, the responsible reaction to such earnings decay is to cut down on costs. Intel would seemingly rather throw Hail Marys.

Yes fabs cost money, and Intel cant exactly stay flat with revenue. Thats where IDM 2.0 comes into play. They will be designing semi-custom chips and fabbing them for whoever, they said they will open up their patents and fab whatever people want ARM, RISC-V, x86*, etc. Its entirely possible someone like Nvidia ends up using Intel fabs, since the margins are going to be better than TSMC. Its *one* of the reasons Nvidia went with Samsung this generation. Point is, the fabs arent be created to sit. They are expanding because they think they can grow. Also in 2025 they plan to fab lidar sensors, for mobileye, their division that is currently partnered to supply ""13 of the 15 top automotive OEMs"" BMW, Volvo, Ford, etc.

>Intel should have built fabs years ago when it was still the market leader and still growing earnings. 

I agree, but what happened happened. They made mistakes under past leadership, they missed out on supplying iPhones with chips, they botched their late to the party smartphone chips, had node issues. All we can do is judge what happens going forward, and I dont think being #2/#3 in the fab space is that bad. And until China figures things out, nobody is going to contend with the 3 leading edge fabs.

>That is, Intel’s decision to create fabs at this time was not decided in a vacuum; instead of the decision being a business-focused decision, it is a situation-focused decision – a decision of convenience rather than one for the sake of shareholders.

I think its more of 2020 and China mixed. Intel now realizes how fragile the semi industry is. Taiwan is going through a drought, tensions are high with China, Covid. One major issue and TSMC is crippled, and every company comes knocking on Intel and Samsungs door. I also wouldnt be surprised if going forward some companies hedge against possible issues and get two fabs to produce for them at once.

>Intel is looking for government subsidies by being the main US chip manufacturer, this is essentially a white flag; Intel cannot compete in the game of technological advancements and needs a handicap.

A white flag? Intel recognizes the position they are in, they can provide the US and its allies something that none of the other leading edge fabs can. Sure they are losing to TSMC, but that doesnt mean they are heading towards failure. If they can get $50b from Biden, why wouldnt they take it? You think TSMC isnt subsidized up the ass by Taiwan? That Samsung isnt heavily tied to the South Korean government? They are all playing the same game. Intel has probably taken the least subsidies buy its government. But now they are willing to play that game to the fullest, hence why Pat is reiterating every chance he gets that stock buybacks will be suspended and that China is a big threat to Taiwan, and that Intel is national security.

**My very short take on why Intel could have a growth spurt in a few years:**

Mobileye: Like I said above, they are partnered with 13 of the top 15 car manufacturers (and even more smaller ones like NIO). People will want some form of autonomy in their future car purchases, probably more than they care about EV, but EV sales are all about tech and autonomous features really show off how modern your EV is. Tesla is doing their own thing for themselves (they once used mobileye), and Google's Waymo CEO says there current plans are to retrofit Chevy vehicles with the system.. So Mobileye is going to likely be the biggest autonomous player. Companies could jump ship, but I dont think they will or want to. Like I said before, Mobileye once used to be Tesla's AP, then allegedly the companies had a falling out when Tesla wanted use it in unsafe ways, too early in development. So Mobileye is playing it safe, and more importantly, IF there are lawsuits or issues, the finger isnt pointed at one manufacturer, and data collection will be better for training the AI. Also at some point there will absolutely be regulation to make some form of autonomy a requirement in new cars, just like airbags, backup cameras, etc. Car accidents are the #1 leading form of death in the US that isnt from a medical issue or suicide, its still a huge deal. 

Basically I think mobileye might grow into one of Intels biggest divisions, since from the looks of it now, they will be the brand behind most autonomous cars.

IDM 2.0, This is a new take for Intel, it turns their fabs into contract services. There is money to be made both by fabbing, and by licensing IP to go into chips being fabbed. This pivots Intel from mostly being a CPU manufacture of their own products into a CPU manufacture that is also a leading edge fab for hire. This opens up the doors to things like next gen consoles, fabbing for Nvidia, fabbing for qualcomm, custom silicon combining x86 and ARM on one package for data centers, it has HUGE potential, but it depends on where the nodes are at and what customers than can acquire. This is a change that shouldve been made the moment Global foundries exited the market. Also its not like silicon demand will ever stop, it will only grow, I believe they can handily take customers away from Samsung, TSMC is another issue, but if the market is growing, they dont have to have a proposition that is able to beat TSMC, it would be great if they did, maybe they will catch up, but there is plenty money to go around. Take a look at TSMC's margins, they are healthy and only going to go up starting with this chip shortage.",Put_It_All_On_Blck,6,/r/investing/comments/n4tc5v/why_you_should_short_the_intel_fab_play/gwxmeaf/,0.09,0.814,0.096,0.8951

I think its more of 2020 and China mixed. Intel now realizes how fragile the semi industry is. Taiwan is going through a drought, tensions are high with China, Covid. One major issue and TSMC is crippled, and every company comes knocking on Intel and Samsungs door. I also wouldnt be surprised if going forward some companies hedge against possible issues and get two fabs to produce for them at once.

>Intel is looking for government subsidies by being the main US chip manufacturer, this is essentially a white flag; Intel cannot compete in the game of technological advancements and needs a handicap.

A white flag? Intel recognizes the position they are in, they can provide the US and its allies something that none of the other leading edge fabs can. Sure they are losing to TSMC, but that doesnt mean they are heading towards failure. If they can get $50b from Biden, why wouldnt they take it? You think TSMC isnt subsidized up the ass by Taiwan? That Samsung isnt heavily tied to the South Korean government? They are all playing the same game. Intel has probably taken the least subsidies buy its government. But now they are willing to play that game to the fullest, hence why Pat is reiterating every chance he gets that stock buybacks will be suspended and that China is a big threat to Taiwan, and that Intel is national security.

**My very short take on why Intel could have a growth spurt in a few years:**

Mobileye: Like I said above, they are partnered with 13 of the top 15 car manufacturers (and even more smaller ones like NIO). People will want some form of autonomy in their future car purchases, probably more than they care about EV, but EV sales are all about tech and autonomous features really show off how modern your EV is. Tesla is doing their own thing for themselves (they once used mobileye), and Google's Waymo CEO says there current plans are to retrofit Chevy vehicles with the system.. So Mobileye is going to likely be the biggest autonomous player. Companies could jump ship, but I dont think they will or want to. Like I said before, Mobileye once used to be Tesla's AP, then allegedly the companies had a falling out when Tesla wanted use it in unsafe ways, too early in development. So Mobileye is playing it safe, and more importantly, IF there are lawsuits or issues, the finger isnt pointed at one manufacturer, and data collection will be better for training the AI. Also at some point there will absolutely be regulation to make some form of autonomy a requirement in new cars, just like airbags, backup cameras, etc. Car accidents are the #1 leading form of death in the US that isnt from a medical issue or suicide, its still a huge deal. 

Basically I think mobileye might grow into one of Intels biggest divisions, since from the looks of it now, they will be the brand behind most autonomous cars.

IDM 2.0, This is a new take for Intel, it turns their fabs into contract services. There is money to be made both by fabbing, and by licensing IP to go into chips being fabbed. This pivots Intel from mostly being a CPU manufacture of their own products into a CPU manufacture that is also a leading edge fab for hire. This opens up the doors to things like next gen consoles, fabbing for Nvidia, fabbing for qualcomm, custom silicon combining x86 and ARM on one package for data centers, it has HUGE potential, but it depends on where the nodes are at and what customers than can acquire. This is a change that shouldve been made the moment Global foundries exited the market. Also its not like silicon demand will ever stop, it will only grow, I believe they can handily take customers away from Samsung, TSMC is another issue, but if the market is growing, they dont have to have a proposition that is able to beat TSMC, it would be great if they did, maybe they will catch up, but there is plenty money to go around.

I wanted to take the bull side, because I do think its undervalued, but wallstreet doesnt like companies that essentially stay flat or slow grow, they like huge growth potential, or shorting them into bankruptcy.

**Now to counter points:**

>In its comfort, Intel has lost its partnership with Apple (AAPL), who has successfully developed M1

The figure I saw was Apple accounted for 3% of revenue. Not that big of a deal. However the M1 itself is concerning, it shows ARM can meet or beat x86. However its also a special situation, Apple has more money than god, and poached talent from every top semi, the more important factor though, is Apple has a cult like brand, they can convince developers to willingly create ARM versions of their apps. On the Windows side, that was an utter failure with Surface RT, and most companies are not going to want to redevelop software, external or internal for ARM, unless they are HUGELY incentivized to do so.

>failed to keep up with the shrinking node trends, currently struggling to produce 10nm chips while others are working on 3nm

Yes, this is obviously a sore spot and still a concern going forward. 7nm is like 5 years late, its not good by any means. 10nm had bad yields and wasnt ready for prime time at launch a few years ago either. However 10nm is literally in mass production right now for Alder Lake, which is a big launch, not a niche product, this is its prime time. And I shouldnt have to explain this to people, but Intel 10nm is equivalent to TSMC 7nm, which is what AMD is currently using. 7nm was reiterated to be on track for 2023 by Pat last week during the earnings call. Intel has historically given us bad time frames, but I can only go with what is said and known. By late 2022 AMD will be on 5nm, so once again, node parity is coming.

>while others are working on 3nm

This is TSMC for Apple first for next year. Nobody else is at that level, There are only 3 leading edge fabs, TSMC, INTC, Samsung. Samsung being the worst of the 3 and expected to actually fall behind Intel when Intel gets to 7nm.


>and has even been overtaken by AMD

Yes, but caveats. AMD has the node advantage for similar products right now, that changes with Alder Lake (later this year), and AMD really only beats Intel in highly threaded applications, like Blender, anythings that maxes out under 8c/16t, like video games, daily use, is a wash. Credit to AMD for catching up, but its not like they are years ahead of Intel. Also this is just at the high performance end, marketshare wise, as of Q1 Intel has 80% marketshare of CPU sales, so despite their slipping high performance consumer CPUs, and some data center, they still dominate in sales.


>Intel finally sees the need to fight back, and the two fabs in Arizona, due 2024, at the cost of $20B is the latest strategy. However, it is a risky strategy. Adding fabs to the business is not just a one-time cost of the $20B but requires consistent upkeep and upgrade costs, something more like $20B per year, which, over the coming decade, would be more than Intel’s total current equity. Intel is thus further adding operational costs to its business during a time when the company is expected to see shrinking revenue and earnings. Typically, the responsible reaction to such earnings decay is to cut down on costs. Intel would seemingly rather throw Hail Marys.

Yes fabs cost money, and Intel cant exactly stay flat with revenue. Thats where IDM 2.0 comes into play. They will be designing semi-custom chips and fabbing them for whoever, they said they will open up their patents and fab whatever people want ARM, RISC-V, x86*, etc. Its entirely possible someone like Nvidia ends up using Intel fabs, since the margins are going to be better than TSMC. Its *one* of the reasons Nvidia went with Samsung this generation. Point is, the fabs arent be created to sit. They are expanding because they think they can grow. Also in 2025 they plan to fab lidar sensors, for mobileye, their division that is currently partnered to supply ""13 of the 15 top automotive OEMs"" BMW, Volvo, Ford, etc.

>Intel should have built fabs years ago when it was still the market leader and still growing earnings. 

I agree, but what happened happened. They made mistakes under past leadership, they missed out on supplying iPhones with chips, they botched their late to the party smartphone chips, had node issues. All we can do is judge what happens going forward, and I dont think being #2/#3 in the fab space is that bad. And until China figures things out, nobody is going to contend with the 3 leading edge fabs.

However 10nm is literally in mass production right now for Alder Lake, which is a big launch, not a niche product, this is its prime time. And I shouldnt have to explain this to people, but Intel 10nm is equivalent to TSMC 7nm, which is what AMD is currently using. 7nm was reiterated to be on track for 2023 by Pat last week during the earnings call. Intel has historically given us bad time frames, but I can only go with what is said and known. By late 2022 AMD will be on 5nm, so once again, node parity is coming.

>while others are working on 3nm

This is TSMC for Apple first for next year. Nobody else is at that level, There are only 3 leading edge fabs, TSMC, INTC, Samsung. Samsung being the worst of the 3 and expected to actually fall behind Intel when Intel gets to 7nm.


>and has even been overtaken by AMD

Yes, but caveats. AMD has the node advantage for similar products right now, that changes with Alder Lake (later this year), and AMD really only beats Intel in highly threaded applications, like Blender, anythings that maxes out under 8c/16t, like video games, daily use, is a wash. Credit to AMD for catching up, but its not like they are years ahead of Intel. Also this is just at the high performance end, marketshare wise, as of Q1 Intel has 80% marketshare of CPU sales, so despite their slipping high performance consumer CPUs, and some data center, they still dominate in sales.


>Intel finally sees the need to fight back, and the two fabs in Arizona, due 2024, at the cost of $20B is the latest strategy. However, it is a risky strategy. Adding fabs to the business is not just a one-time cost of the $20B but requires consistent upkeep and upgrade costs, something more like $20B per year, which, over the coming decade, would be more than Intel’s total current equity. Intel is thus further adding operational costs to its business during a time when the company is expected to see shrinking revenue and earnings. Typically, the responsible reaction to such earnings decay is to cut down on costs. Intel would seemingly rather throw Hail Marys.

Yes fabs cost money, and Intel cant exactly stay flat with revenue. Thats where IDM 2.0 comes into play. They will be designing semi-custom chips and fabbing them for whoever, they said they will open up their patents and fab whatever people want ARM, RISC-V, x86*, etc. Its entirely possible someone like Nvidia ends up using Intel fabs, since the margins are going to be better than TSMC. Its *one* of the reasons Nvidia went with Samsung this generation. Point is, the fabs arent be created to sit. They are expanding because they think they can grow. Also in 2025 they plan to fab lidar sensors, for mobileye, their division that is currently partnered to supply ""13 of the 15 top automotive OEMs"" BMW, Volvo, Ford, etc.

>Intel should have built fabs years ago when it was still the market leader and still growing earnings. 

I agree, but what happened happened. They made mistakes under past leadership, they missed out on supplying iPhones with chips, they botched their late to the party smartphone chips, had node issues. All we can do is judge what happens going forward, and I dont think being #2/#3 in the fab space is that bad. And until China figures things out, nobody is going to contend with the 3 leading edge fabs.

>That is, Intel’s decision to create fabs at this time was not decided in a vacuum; instead of the decision being a business-focused decision, it is a situation-focused decision – a decision of convenience rather than one for the sake of shareholders.

I think its more of 2020 and China mixed. Intel now realizes how fragile the semi industry is. Taiwan is going through a drought, tensions are high with China, Covid. One major issue and TSMC is crippled, and every company comes knocking on Intel and Samsungs door. I also wouldnt be surprised if going forward some companies hedge against possible issues and get two fabs to produce for them at once.

>Intel is looking for government subsidies by being the main US chip manufacturer, this is essentially a white flag; Intel cannot compete in the game of technological advancements and needs a handicap.

A white flag? Intel recognizes the position they are in, they can provide the US and its allies something that none of the other leading edge fabs can. Sure they are losing to TSMC, but that doesnt mean they are heading towards failure. If they can get $50b from Biden, why wouldnt they take it? You think TSMC isnt subsidized up the ass by Taiwan? That Samsung isnt heavily tied to the South Korean government? They are all playing the same game. Intel has probably taken the least subsidies buy its government. But now they are willing to play that game to the fullest, hence why Pat is reiterating every chance he gets that stock buybacks will be suspended and that China is a big threat to Taiwan, and that Intel is national security.

**My very short take on why Intel could have a growth spurt in a few years:**

Mobileye: Like I said above, they are partnered with 13 of the top 15 car manufacturers (and even more smaller ones like NIO). People will want some form of autonomy in their future car purchases, probably more than they care about EV, but EV sales are all about tech and autonomous features really show off how modern your EV is. Tesla is doing their own thing for themselves (they once used mobileye), and Google's Waymo CEO says there current plans are to retrofit Chevy vehicles with the system.. So Mobileye is going to likely be the biggest autonomous player. Companies could jump ship, but I dont think they will or want to. Like I said before, Mobileye once used to be Tesla's AP, then allegedly the companies had a falling out when Tesla wanted use it in unsafe ways, too early in development. So Mobileye is playing it safe, and more importantly, IF there are lawsuits or issues, the finger isnt pointed at one manufacturer, and data collection will be better for training the AI. Also at some point there will absolutely be regulation to make some form of autonomy a requirement in new cars, just like airbags, backup cameras, etc. Car accidents are the #1 leading form of death in the US that isnt from a medical issue or suicide, its still a huge deal. 

Basically I think mobileye might grow into one of Intels biggest divisions, since from the looks of it now, they will be the brand behind most autonomous cars.

IDM 2.0, This is a new take for Intel, it turns their fabs into contract services. There is money to be made both by fabbing, and by licensing IP to go into chips being fabbed. This pivots Intel from mostly being a CPU manufacture of their own products into a CPU manufacture that is also a leading edge fab for hire. This opens up the doors to things like next gen consoles, fabbing for Nvidia, fabbing for qualcomm, custom silicon combining x86 and ARM on one package for data centers, it has HUGE potential, but it depends on where the nodes are at and what customers than can acquire. This is a change that shouldve been made the moment Global foundries exited the market. Also its not like silicon demand will ever stop, it will only grow, I believe they can handily take customers away from Samsung, TSMC is another issue, but if the market is growing, they dont have to have a proposition that is able to beat TSMC, it would be great if they did, maybe they will catch up, but there is plenty money to go around. Take a look at TSMC's margins, they are healthy and only going to go up starting with this chip shortage.",Put_It_All_On_Blck,6,/r/investing/comments/n4tc5v/why_you_should_short_the_intel_fab_play/gwxmeaf/,0.09,0.814,0.096,0.8951

Im not buying Nvidia at its current valuation. Even without knowing its current pricing, I admittedly shouldve bought years ago. Nvidia is a great company that is simply expensive for what is right now. Also there are a ton of silicon startup companies gunning for the future of AI. Also the ARM deal has hit a brick wall. If the ARM deal goes through, yeah its a good buy. If they do end up remaining one of the big dogs in AI, again good buy, but as its stand those are pretty big unknowns.

And AMD? I was one of those people that picked AMD up at $3. And I sold it for 100k profit. AMD is a great company, but again, their valuation is bad. AMD currently has 20% of the overall CPU market, even losing a bit of share in Q1. This is after 4 years of Zen, which was a godsend to them. Look at their financials and tell me that you think they are worth half of INTC, they arent. I love Lisa Su, love that they came back, but they are trading above of where they should be.
