0,CWBR," Here's to CWBR, my darkhorse covid play. Heavily shorted, low float, high insider ownership, super-promising drugs. Volume has slowed to a crawl and paperhands keep throwing their tickets away; weak buy volume on Friday still crushed the shorts. Quarterly chart looks a little weak but the monthly chart looks better. Fingers crossed for some good news, but watch for the good-news short deals! 1k shares @ 1.30

ZOM appears to have similar recovery, but is weaker. If it can secure support at .75 it'll probably keep trucking along back towards a dollar over the next month or two.

ORLA rejected 4.40. Low float and \**extremely\** shorted. Better-than-expected upside but I'm looking to get back in 3.50-3.75. Sold 300 @ 4.05. When the rocket gets launched it's going to be worth holding on to for a while. Consistently makes the Biggest Loser board, but it's a reporting artifact acting like it opens premarket at $5 every day.

GSAT appears to have secured 1.20. Barcoded last week for hedging, and every day it looked like a bunch of buys at market open, so I suspect it's getting ready to make another jump. Put:call ratio looks bullish. GSAT is my favorite Nokia synergy stock as a satellite 5G-anywhere play.

Speaking of NOK, the charts make me think it's overheated right now and ready for a pullback. I'd be lucky to get 4.25. NOK has been on my watchlist as my Most Valuable Stock as an investment. If I had 50 grand I'd YOLO and diamond hand for dividends coming back. I'm also super-bullish on their plans for their phones, and they have the right stuff to render iOS and Android obsolete.

532,OR," That’s not how that works. If the options are ITM (In the Money) you can either:

A.) Sell the call options for the profits made 

OR

B.) Exercise the right to purchase the 100 shares. 

If your options end OTM (Out the Money), they expire worthless and the money spent to purchase them is lost. 

Hope that helps.",Doobers_McDooberson,1,/r/RobinHood/comments/nens8w/please_help_i_dont_understand_the_options_i_bought/gyh8rt8/,0.077,0.767,0.156,0.6597
533,RH," First off, you are fine, you won't have to buy the shares, you can sell the contract during market hours anytime as long as you have a day trade (assuming you bought it today). Buying the shares, or exercising the contract shouldn't happen automatically (I don't think but could be wrong). I do believe RH will try and close out the contract for you if its near being In the Money. Word of advice, try not to buy in the same week as expiration. Watch some youtube and do some more research.
