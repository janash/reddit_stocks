You get 2% less with Gemini (9.5% vs 7.4%) but I split between them for platform and stablecoin diversification (USDC and GUSD). Gemini also has a Bitlicence in addition to money transmitter license which adds extra compliance credibility.

Stick to fully backed coins like USDC, PAX, GUSD.

Nothing is risk free but Genesis, the underlying lender, has had zero defaults since 2013ish through multiple brutal drawdowns that would have Lehman'ed many tradfi firms and debt instruments.

They are of course making more yield with the lent money but unless you can do the derivatives and carry trades yourself this is a moot point. 

For extra security I diversify between a grid of different platforms and stablecoins. Three platforms and three coins gives you 9 risk ""buckets"" in case of some technical or compliance fault. Defi lending adds another dimension (and you can self insure with defi insurance like Nexus Mutual).

In this negative yield environment I see no reason not to have at least half of your cash/bond allocation in stablecoins.

>Snp500 is normally 10-12% yearly. If you dont want that, BTC and ETH can net you more than 7.4% by just buying and holding BTC or ETH in a year.

The goal of this investment is to create a steady, predictable growth and diversify against equity price risk. Most investors do not want 100% of their portfolio in stocks. And please pardon me if I laugh at your confident estimates of BTC or ETH growth over time.

40,BB," Hi all - I'm a noob invester and don't really know what I'm doing. I managed to save up £10,000 over the last couple of years, and currently over £6,000 of it sits in shares. 25% Tesla, 25% Nio, 10% BB (I know stupid), and the rest is made up of smaller percentages.

Overall I believe in all these companies (except maybe BB) and I am willing to hold long-term. I am not interested in short-term trading. However, I am beginning to wonder whether I have been kind of stupid, and that maybe I should sell all of this for the small loss of £100 that I'm currently at, and invest this money into myself. 

My life is at a bit of a turning point, and I am making my living as a freelancer. I make decent money as a copywriter, but the whole reason I started that was so that I could earn more money as a freelance musician. If I sold my shares, I would relieve my financial pressure for the next year or so and I could focus on working every day on my music freelance career. 

Basically TLDR, I don't know wtf I am doing with investment, and I think I have gone too deep. Do you think that I should sell my shares for a loss and start from scratch, perhaps going back in in the future? Or is long term investment a pretty safe thing to do? As mentioned I'm making decent money so it's not like that £6,000 is emergency money, but I'm just thinking in terms of being smart.

why

""Are you considering paying for the service and why or why not?""

Hard pass.

I don't have any interest in paying for subscription services and especially something that costs almost $1,999 (but is ""ONE DAY ONLY"" 1299.)

The other issue with MF is that it often feels like a number of their picks are released during the trading day. I had a few instances last year of something I owned mooning out of nowhere during the trading day and I found out MF had recommended it. So people are paying for recommendations, waiting for the drop and then trying to see if they can be first in a feeding frenzy? Why not release reports in the evening so people can read, research a little and consider an investment the next day after putting some thought into it?

EDIT: And just after I wrote this, some discussion/rumor that NET (which I do own) is up out of nowhere because of MF recommendation. 

I also just like doing my own research.

With biotech, I owned several names last year (and then BNTX/MRNA this year, which I've sold the last of recently) but it's such a difficult, volatile industry. I was fascinated learning about what I invested in last year but I realized that I don't have a healthcare background and was supported by massive inflows into things like ARKG. As the year went on, I really thought I'd take the W on most of the names because the moves seemed unsustainable and I just really wanted fewer names that I had to monitor/think about. I have no specific biotech holdings at this point.

Hard pass.

I don't have any interest in paying for subscription services and especially something that costs almost $1,999 (but is ""ONE DAY ONLY"" 1299.)

The other issue with MF is that it often feels like a number of their picks are released during the trading day. I had a few instances last year of something I owned mooning out of nowhere during the trading day and I found out MF had recommended it. So people are paying for recommendations, waiting for the drop and then trying to see if they can be first in a feeding frenzy? Why not release reports in the evening so people can read, research a little and consider an investment the next day after putting some thought into it?

With biotech, I owned several names last year (and then BNTX/MRNA this year, which I've sold the last of recently) but it's such a difficult, volatile industry. I was fascinated learning about what I invested in last year but I realized that I don't have a healthcare background and was supported by massive inflows into things like ARKG. As the year went on, I really thought I'd take the W on most of the names because the moves seemed unsustainable and I just really wanted fewer names that I had to monitor/think about.

* Company still losing a lot of cash. As expected of a grow-at-all-costs tech company. All the growth techs actively push back their earnings/profit as much as possible. Even the FAAAMs still try to do this as megacaps.

* Share price went up despite the huge dollar losses because this company is valued on growth rather than profits atm. Important part is business growth, market expansion, increased homes bought/sold, increased inventory, and contracts.

* Another thing is to not get too freaked out by the debt & operating loss OR get too hyped about the big numbers for sales and pre-adjusted profit. The reason why is OPEN operates in the personal home and real estate space. These numbers are inflated due to the price of the good they sell. 5x leverage on $800K debt would mean you're from r/WSB if you're buying stocks but if you're buying homes then you're just Californian. These high home prices means OPEN will post big numbers. 

* That's why EBITDA is the better value to use here to value the company. Michael Burry himself prefers EV/EBITDA to P/E anyways because it's a better metric. P/E, sales, profit/loss, and other basic metrics might not be best to valuate OPEN or other home realtors who also do iBuying like Z.

My personal take is that thing are going as planned. Real estate market is hot. Z, OPEN, RDFN, and other real estate companies are disruptors and should have good future outlook. Having used opendoor myself, I think OPEN is disruptive. They undercut other agents, brokerages, and brokers while offering customers directly to agents looking for them.

57,MSCI," Low effort investing / ETF and 4 stocks -> advice on long term autopilot investment

Hi altogether,

I hope this post is here in the right place.

I realized that I developed an quite unwelcome behavior of checking stocks daily and everything what goes with it like getting nervous if they fall etc.

Initially I got into investing with the big core MSCI World ETF for long term investing.
Somehow it lead to buying small portions of stocks and trying to beat the market an so on.

I want to put my portfolio back on autopilot for a few years at least 5-15. 

For that I want to have this proportions:
70% ETF <- like the core MSCI World 

10% ETF <- like the core MSCI emerging markets

4 stocks * 5% <- this would be company’s I genuinely believe have a solid product

I have the following questions:

1. Are the proportions reasonable.
2. Should I just go for the biggest ETF or should I take a look at for example vanguard and the VGWL.
3. Instead of emerging markets should I consider a specialized ETF like green energy or some ESG ETF
4. I consider to put about 10 of the money allocated for investment on the side for eventualities like a small or medium bear market to be able in addition to cost averaging be able to get a better deal. Is this reasonable or schools I just put everything on autopilot?

I’m 32 in Canada. I work in an office, 60k/year.

I am receiving a lump sum (30k) that was willed to me and I don’t want to screw it up. What is the best tool for investing? I have heard about QuestTrade in a Podcast, and I know people who invest through their bank (I’m with TD) but I’ve heard the fees are excessive.

59,EDIT," Hey everyone, I just received an interesting job offer where part of my salary will be paid as Basis Points(BPS) ownership of the company (Which is a startup and currently not worth very much).

I currently have a well paid and safe job, this job offer matches my current salary and adds 20 BPS ownership of the company.

Changing jobs will be taking a risk so those 20 BPS have to make a difference for me, there's also other secondary benefits for changing not relevant here that I'm taking into the equation.

EDIT:

The company just sent me a mock of the agreement that I will be signing, what I will be offered is called nonstatutory stock options (NSO).

It might be wise to consult an accountant now and not find out you've made a big mistake later.",LiqCourage,2,/r/investing/comments/p2w1dc/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/h8ohtsi/,0.052,0.793,0.155,0.8176
65,IRS," You should never gamble with borrowed money. This money belongs to Uncle Sam. You should never gamble with money you can not afford to lose. This tax money is money you cannot afford to lose. At best you end up with a short term loan paying the IRS points on money you lost. At worst, they take everything else you own & you end up selling yourself in prison for candy bars. The fact that you asked here already says you are affected psychologically. You have already lost in your mind. This is a NO win, NO win scenario.

66,TD," Every brokerage will have positives and negatives. The nice thing about Robinhood is that it's easy to use, access. and has instant deposits.  


Sometimes is pays to be investing with a brokerage that is a partner with your bank. For example, if you have money in an account at Bank of America and use one of their credit cards, then it's wise to consider investing using Merril Edge because your balance there will count towards your overall balance for reward programs.  


If you want to invest using little money, some brokerages let you buy ""fractional shares"", meaning instead of being forced to buy 1 share of Stock A for $500, you could buy 0.5 shares of that stock for $250, and so on. I think TD Ameritrade and a few brokerages allow this, but make sure to do your research.",FridayTendies,1,/r/investing/comments/p2w1dc/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/h8p58fd/,0.014,0.841,0.145,0.9186
67,IMO," IMO, start looking at companies and thinking about what you like and don't about the company, what is exciting and what might be questionable/potentially problematic? What is the moat? What do customer and/or employee reviews say? Eventually you'll be able to know more and more what you're looking for and be able to go through companies and decide whether something is worth further exploration or you reach a point where it's not of interest and it's on to the next one.

 Start looking around noticing themes and themes don't have to be shiny and sleek to do well - I invested in pet healthcare 5 years ago and that did extremely well. I invested in generators (GNRC) last Fall. 

I don't think that CNBC is a good thing at all. There's so many great companies that never get a mention - it's a lot of the same names over and over. Bloomberg is somewhat better.

I think there's some great podcasts and interviews (Good Investing Talks on Youtube is a good one - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5Z-C01O2VlpeD1rMs_HS2Q, Invest like the Best w/Patrick O'Shaughnessy is great) and listen to investors talk about what they found compelling about certain companies they invested in and their approach.

I think what you have to try to do is to find great companies early on before they have some news announcement that everyone tries to chase. Does the company solve a problem? Is it superbly managed? Does it offer a new, better way to do a common task? Is there a potentially huge market? Is it a durable growth story with a long runway or is it a fad?",dvdmovie1,2,/r/investing/comments/p2w1dc/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/h8p67sj/,0.028,0.77,0.203,0.9928
68,TV," I'm not a sophisticated trader by any means, but Bloomberg seems to be a pretty reliable source of day-to-day information. If you have an Etrade account, you have access to Bloomberg TV which is nice to keep running in the background. Lot of technical jargon on their broadcast, but listen long enough and you'll begin to pick up the gist of it.

As far as day trading is concerned, I wouldn't touch that unless you really know what you're doing. Proceed at your own peril.",HubcapMotors,1,/r/investing/comments/p2w1dc/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/h8p2w7g/,0.06,0.852,0.087,0.5405
69,APPH," I like the vertical farming space but when I looked at APPH and Aerofarms, I thought they were overvalued.   I also expected some significant seasonal variation especially for tomatoes since most are grown in this country during the summer months.   I was waiting for it collapse (I do not short because you cannot control downside risk), but will re-look at them now.  The r/AppHarvest has some good information.

On Aerofarms, I like the materials and location strategy they are pursuing but the financial disclosures have me worried and will also wait on them.",stickman07738,2,/r/investing/comments/p2pest/appharvests_disappointing_results/h8mxrtg/,0.071,0.798,0.131,0.6199
70,APPH," Everyone would buy in at $3 on a stock that had a $35 high during SPAC-mania before it came to an end in March 2021. It won't see that low, assuming no black swan events.

I was aware of tomato produce limits this year (droughts everywhere) and definitely should have bought puts, but I didn't think APPH would do this bad. They basically lowered all of their near-term guidance while maintaining their 2025 outlook - which is complete baloney anyway because all of these garbage SPACs with their 2025 revenue promises/outlooks are overpromising without any delivery short-term. While it's likely not a scam business, I'm expecting APPH to have some dead cat bounce off the tailwinds of a choppy-yet-bullish market towards OPEX next week, then we'll see where things go. August historically doesn't end well for markets and we're sitting at tip-top valuations blah blah you know the deal, asset bubbles are at all time highs and stocks like APPH contribute to that a great deal.

Stock's probably worth where it's sitting now around 8-9 dollars. Will need to see Q3 guidance and how they spend some of that cash flow going into the tougher season for produce but I doubt they'll make any significant rebounds on the business side for the next quarter. But as I said, dead cat bounce possibility - play it short term and set a strict stop loss.",Inori92,-1,/r/investing/comments/p2pest/appharvests_disappointing_results/h8lopx7/,0.134,0.756,0.11,-0.805

72,IP," Does anyone know if the tomatoes taste good? The company has no IP, just scale. Scaled produce is typically bland.

If they could make ultra high quality produce close to markets, or maybe exotic produce normally found in a rainforest for Michelin star quality restaurants (and make it economically viable), then it would be more interesting.

It seems like a future value stock that should trade at 8x earnings that disguised itself as a tech company to raise capital 5 years too early.",BYoung001,6,/r/investing/comments/p2pest/appharvests_disappointing_results/h8ly5up/,0.049,0.829,0.123,0.7574
73,APPH," No I haven't seen many 90% discount on stocks in the last 4-5 years, even NKLA which is the poster-boy for SPAC disaster is trading, well actually NKLA is about at 80-90% down from ATH lol. But NKLA has no revenue at all and is all empty promises until fulfillment, or signs alluding to that. 

Anyways, I'm more addressing that your target valuation of ~$3-4 might be correct but there are going to be buyers at levels above who are probably not going to let it go down to your level. Again, you might be questioning that and all I can say is only time will tell, NKLA is a very rare occurrence. So no, on my end, I don't see very many 90% discounts / fire-sales or stocks plummeting to that degree to meet ""fair value"". 

Also your last paragraph confuses me a bit because I agree with you and I wouldn't pay it myself, and I also think APPH is not doing anything all that revolutionary - Netherlands have already done it. I just think those valuations / fundamentals don't really matter in the current markets, it's more about flow and with a dip like what APPH has, there will be buyers at some point.",Inori92,-2,/r/investing/comments/p2pest/appharvests_disappointing_results/h8lqzb8/,0.084,0.834,0.083,0.2042
