1,CPA," As a CPA, I would simply like to add a few things:

1) Economic depreciation are called impairment, I never saw a FS that used the term economic depreciation from my clients. Also, I have never heard the term in my accounting classes. That said, I did not audit all the entities publicly traded so that does not mean the term is never used. I just thought I might as well share the most common term. Furthermore, an entity will register an impairment when the accounting value is higher than the fair value (either the value on the market or the estimated value as per the cash flow. That said, most of the time the two values should be about the same). 

2) PP&E, other tangible assets and intangible assets will go directly in your BS. They won't appear in your P&L, unless you are talking about depreciation. (When you mention the capital expenses)

3) for extraordinary items, I would simply add that the entity has to present them distinctly in the P&L.

Great post though! As a CPA, that seems like basic information that everyone should know. I sometimes forget that not everyone knows this. If anyone has questions on the financial statements, feel free to post them on r/accounting.

3,IP," I think you're maybe conflating two separate things. The idea behind depreciation is to adhere to the matching principle in accounting which is based on matching expenses to use of those expenses. So for anything long term (more than one year), depreciation is a way to quantify the use of that asset over it's lifetime instead of expensing it all at once since the economic benefit derived from it is more than a short term timeline. 

Impairment is to prevent economic assets which the depreciation (or if it's an asset which has no fixed economic life) from being overstated, for instance large amounts of damage reduces the life of a piece of machinery, or an IP someone owned becomes toxic and is no longer worth what it was. 

It seems you're estimating utilization efficiency based output, which isn't an accounting measure, but more of an economic one. If I add more machines, does it become more difficult over time to keep productivity at the same levels as one machine for instance. Accounting is just really a measurement system, you can use what the financial statements say to create a model over time that gives you what you're looking at, but no financial statement metric measures that.",AlphaOhmega,1,/r/stocks/comments/nlhcci/accounting_101_part_1_the_income_statement/gzjuyyk/,0.056,0.879,0.065,-0.2592

56,PLUG," People are mentioning the rebalancing and PLUG. That wasn't just a rebalancing, it was a major change not in the etf itself but in the clean energy index it's tracking. The index wqs completely overhauled. ETF manager has to comply to some rules set by the index it's following. As it's a full replication etf, Black Rock had to buy stocks and during the ""rebalancing"" sell positions to comply with the new index rules and company weighting. Had to sell millions of Plug shares as well. That's why it's plummeted so hard, not only because of accounting mistakes.

Now about the index and etf. It had 30 100% hreen energy companies, now it has 80+ not only pure clean energy but related companies, etc. PLUG which was a heaviest holding and a major drag down lost half of it's weight, etc.

59,DD," That’s terrible DD.

The last green wave in 2008 had the same message.  ICLN was $50. It then crashed completely and even with this crazy run the past 12 months barely recovered to half that value.  

You can justify ICLN as necessary, but many others see a basket of companies that are in a highly competitive, high capital, low margin, low/no cash flows, low moat industry that is also currently undergoing disruption.  Yes, some of these companies have great ideas, but as we pivot away from fossil fuels, it’s very likely these current technologies get disrupted themselves.  Given the previous statement about the industry, it’s very possible many perform poorly or go bankrupt even with a few winners.

If you want to invest in renewables, stay out of the fray and invest in electrical transmission companies or raw material miners,

86,GM," Great purchase for a beginner. Too many people jump in and start researching Elliot waves and candlestick patterns and try to hit grand slams and capture massive gains. They love to tell you about their big wins but leave out all then times they lost their entire initial investment.

I didn’t buy Ford but I did buy GM a while back after seeing the crazy rise of Tesla and their valuation. Turned out very well for me.

Tesla is worth 4.5 times both Ford and GM combined. That is insane. And that valuation showed every manufacturer just how valuable EV is. That showed every major owner of Ford/GM and all executives that their net worth can literally triple if they get EV right. They have logistics, distribution, and footprints that Tesla dreams about. That potential value also easily allows the manufacturers to stop handcuffing themselves to the oil and gas lobbying. Energy companies can’t sky rocket their valuation. EV can.

I can’t deny I’m starting to see Teslas on the road a lot more. But honestly, most people are buying the base model which is kind of ugly and plain when you see the real one in person. Not the add-on loaded one you see in pictures/videos. Just my opinion, not the aesthetic simplicity the likes of Apple products. The premium models are beautiful though; but overpriced.

Basically, that’s why I’m long F and GM. They are still 2-3 years out from actually selling relevant EV. But I’d expect a sharp spike when they officially announce market release of a few models.

179,ATH," I think there's a pretty big difference between thinking inflation is ""cancelled"" and recouping a fractional amount of losses after a big sell-off. NASDAQ is still ~600 points off its ATH.

The week by week sort of obscures it, but it's a fairly straight correlation that Treasury yields rose, NASDAQ sold off, and now that Treasury yields took a pause so did the sell-off. But unless you think Treasury yields are actually going to *go back down* then no, inflation isn't cancelled because objectively it hasn't been and it also means stocks are not going back to their ATHs any time soon.

226,EM," A couple of things. 

* I deliberately choose choose a large and mid only developed markets only benchmark and try to mix and match other indexes because it allows me to decide myself how much I want to weight developed and emerging markets
* The FTSE Global All Cap Index is great. I recommend it for anyone that just want's to set and forget and never worry about anything at all, it's a very fine choice.
* I am not trying to exactly recreate the worldwide stock market but balance it out with a small emphasis on gdp. However I don't want to fully recreate the world economy only by gdp, so I am going for less than the overweight [56%](https://www.statista.com/statistics/710680/global-stock-markets-by-country/) but more than the [16%](https://www.statista.com/statistics/256381/share-of-global-regions-in-the-gross-domestic-product/)\-[24%](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/the-88-trillion-world-economy-in-one-chart/) (depending on calculation) of the worldwide gdp share the US holds.  


So while 47% is still relatively high overall this is more or less necessary because the US holds a large share of the publicly listed companies and is the biggest economy of the west.

233,TA," Yes I understand TA. I've been doing this a while.  I've studied behavioral finance too. The only validation to TA is that other ""herd mentality"" TA users keep it alive by all acting the same to the patterns. When you invest,  taking the business approach of being an owner is always far superior than trying to predict what a group of traders will do.  You can't use TA to see where a company is going to be 5 years or 10 years from now.

 Seeing patterns in the past is always going to be a reaction of the mind. The only reason they all seem to work,  is because when they don't... the pattern isn't formed to validate.   Supports and resistance as well, it's all trader mentality.  Resistance is created by the fear of traders that missed selling at the previous recent highs,  so traders who missed selling the last time tend to pull trigger as it approaches again causing a high sell demand,  or what you TA folks call it Resistance point.

280,JP," If you are following the market on a daily basis, then you might as well partake in the game of musical chairs. Right now, the market is euphoric and at the ATH, so a pullback could be imminent, or the market could go on another run.

I'd wait right now to see what happens in the next week or two as we get a move one way or another away from SPY $415. If the market still has room to move higher, then I'd maintain 25% USD, 15% EUR (managing the currency balance depending on whether EURUSD breaks higher or lower), 5% crypto (once volatility has died down; BTC, ETH, IOTA); 10% gold, and 45% in reopening equity trades. Financials, consumer spending, and cash-positive FANGs like Apple and Google. Just try to keep your positions as simple as possible so you can quickly liquidate your positions and move into a strong currency if shit hits the fan.

I think if you wait you'll be able to get 225 basis points or more on the 10 year, some time next year. It will depend on whether inflation gets out of control or not, whether the Fed needs to go on a crazy hiking spree that would crush bonds. But I'd probably start buying the front end of the curve out to the 10 year bonds around 190-225 basis points in small position sizes, maybe through ETFs. I wouldn't use ETFs outside of bonds however, as you can usually find good picks that will outperform the market, and you don't want to be caught in a stampede where you are trying to sell the same basket of stocks as every other retail investor out there.

So yeah, 40-45% cash position, then try to sell-out before the music stops, and look to buy the big companies with an aggressive 75% equity/15% bond/5% crypto/5% cash portfolio. For the equities portion, I'm thinking:

AAPL now has a lower P/E than other FAANGMs but higher than its historical with very little change in its revenue streams.

It will likely retain its growth rate as long as people love Apple products. 

I don't find any of the FAANGMs to be overvalued at the moment. They are immensely profitable, growing like what you'd expect from growth companies, and their products are globally popular and likely to stay that way.

319,PT," After making my 100% gain from the american covid recovery, I dumped some into EWZ to catch Brazil's delayed recovery. i'm up 13% on EWZ since march- So it was a good move 4 months ago.That being said, Brazil (EWZ) is very cyclic in its ups and down, And I'll be selling when it hits $40/share, and will wait for its next 15% dip, then ride it up to $45/share. While waiting on the dip, i'll move the money to VOO, where i'll either be wrong and not make as much as I could, or will be right, and will have saved myself from a 15% qtrly dip that brazil likes to do.

I think there is a least one, maybe two more of these quarterly dips and rises before brazil either 1) breaks it's trend and keeps rising at a steady rate or 2) election cycle chaos causes a 20% dip overnight, in which I'll buy back into right away.  Afterall, it's Bolso vs. whoever the PT is able to wrangle up - A literal shitstorm waiting to happen, so I'd rather sit it out.

tldr, i've got some money in EWZ, and it's treated me well these last 4 months. i'm going to try and play off the cyclic pattern to get a little more out of it; - But i'll be gone before the next presidential election cycle-",NavalLacrosse,2,/r/stocks/comments/nliwx4/opportunity_in_emerging_markets/gziv9up/,0.034,0.916,0.05,0.3883

I use trading view for most of my charting needs. 

For your scenario you may consider using a 20 period moving average for example.

A $10 increase from the hypothetical dip to $60 
Would generally correspond to a break above a certain periods (e.g. on a 4hour chart)'s 20 period moving average.

Trading view can send you an alert when the stock touches/breaks above the 20period MA.

356,ON," Alrightyyyy I got you fam.

Fist of all, I think of “trading” to be a pejorative term for “investing”. All those people who day trade and swing trade are gambling.. which in essence is fine! However, they’re playing with their savings and you think it’s proper investing. Buffet say “time in the market beats timing the market”. Stop looking for a quick penny because chances are, you’re going to get emotional and fail. 

Stay away from options for the first year. Idk if you’re trading options or equities, but stick to equities until you get your footing. 

Second of all, the best way to win in an equity market is time. Markets fluctuate. If you have a conviction, stick to it. Even if you appear to be wrong, stay with your thesis. You might be right in the end, but if you sold too early into red, you’re wrong and you lose. 

Target ETF’s. Most people fail to consistently pick winners. That’s why ETF’s come in handy. Let the professionals make the picks. Take $20 a week and put it into the $SPY. Average into positions, and don’t YOLO. Beware the FOMO demon too. He’s big, he’s loud, and he’s convincing, but he’s evil at nature. Make coordinated moves with conviction. Make a journal and diary your thoughts and plays. 

You’re building equity, so let it build and compound. Look for diversification. Get compounding dividends. Look for growth. Look for value. **YOU MAKE MONEY ON THE BUY, not the sell!!**

If I see I'm just going down a useless rabbit whole, I will just dump them, but I think a look at the investor's presentation would be worth it, just to see how much revenue comes from IT servicing.

I'll add Serco to the list of names to dig into!

381,RIDE," I can't for the life of me understand why anyone would invest in this company.

Douchebag CEO aside, this is a company built around one product: an EV truck.  That means they have to compete with Tesla and every major auto manufacturer out there, who have all committed to transitioning their fleets over to EV.  Ford already makes the best selling vehicle in the US and it's going to be EV.

What makes anyone think that RIDE, or any of the small EV players for that matter, can compete?",SirGasleak,2,/r/stocks/comments/nl81ts/ride_is_lordstown_motors_doomed_now/gzif42c/,0.042,0.879,0.078,0.34

383,TSLA," TSLA was the only real game in town... til lately.  VW, Ford and pretty much every other major auto maker are making their entry.  

They very well may be behind TSLA in terms of FA (fully autonomous), but that doesn't really matter.  Right now people are looking for nice electric cars with good safety (e.g. collision avoidance) at a good price.

As these well know automakers eat away at TSLA they'll also be perfecting their own FA for years down the road when that becomes the norm.

TSLA has lots of legit competition now.  The narrative that ""TSLA will own the EV market"" simply is provably no longer true.  5, 10 years from now there'll still be roughly the same major automakers still competing for that ridiculously lucrative pie.",Karnes,10,/r/stocks/comments/nl5tob/teslas_explosive_growth/gzgstep/,0.068,0.738,0.194,0.9663
384,FSD," I hear your point, but think that 40% revenue growth is likely underestimating Tesla's trajectory at least for the next few years significantly and also ignores margin expansion of which there's likely to be a lot (removal of radar, additional FSD revs at $10k per vehicle, front-end casting, and 4680 cells all seem like feasible areas of improvement).

I'm viewing 50% growth as the minimum target this year and with Q1 showing 74% YoY growth and production ramping alongside an expansion in Shanghai plus two additional factories starting up later in the year I don't think that's terribly unreasonable. Both Austin and Berlin have the physical footprint to have much higher production than their existing facilities as well.

Still not adding unless it hits $500 but if and when it does I'm finding a fat stack of cash to drop on it unless something major changes in the meantime.",Runningflame570,1,/r/stocks/comments/nl5tob/teslas_explosive_growth/gzhb8ia/,0.033,0.844,0.123,0.9402
