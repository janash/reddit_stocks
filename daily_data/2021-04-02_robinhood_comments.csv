0,TD," TD bank gave me 69 cents per share last time I was amazed , the stock itself was around 60$ , doing the math if I had 6,000$ invested In TD, I would get 69$ from them every quarter . Or 276$ a year. That’s pretty good actually",KingKilla_94,79,/r/RobinHood/comments/mi5bbl/marchs_earned_dividends_from_a_20000_account/gt2wzsz/,0.0,0.763,0.237,0.8885
1,APTS," Undervalued and relatively unknown dividend play is APTS. The stock is criminally low at this moment in time, though it did pick up 50 cents a share yesterday. Trading just over $10 at the moment, it pays out 17.5 cents per share quarterly, or 70 cents per year. When the stock was a bit higher a couple years ago it was paying $1.04/share per year",The_original_Maccyx,1,/r/RobinHood/comments/mi5bbl/marchs_earned_dividends_from_a_20000_account/gt4kbxv/,0.031,0.867,0.102,0.5719

3,XOM," My past 30 days clocked in at 85.66, almost half of that coming from my XOM shares I scooped up back during the huge dip in oil prices last March.  It's been very interesting watching attitudes change so much and so quickly over the past 12 months.  Everyone was basically writing oil's obituary and saying that Tesla and EVs were the future, meanwhile I've never seen so many brand new trucks and SUVs on the roads and parking lots lmao.  Easiest trade of my life!  My shares are up 27.7% since I started accumulating last March, with an average yield cost of 7.72% it's always a satisfying feeling when I get another check from my oil company :P",Bobbe22,2,/r/RobinHood/comments/mi5bbl/marchs_earned_dividends_from_a_20000_account/gt3d5ma/,0.0,0.812,0.188,0.9695

14,TD, Why not reinvest dividend especially if it is the retirement account. Every quarter you buy fraction of a share (or full share depending on price and dividend amount) with dividend which would bring even more dividend next time. It is great for long term strategy. With rule of 72 you will double your money in 18.94 years just from dividends alone.
