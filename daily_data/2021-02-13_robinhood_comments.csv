0,ALGN," Posting my gains for the week because I'm tired of seeing ads on Reddit and I want the gold: https://imgur.com/x8sVWHf

My biggest increases were AMD, SOXL, ALGN, and ETH.

ALGN is great - most people suck at taking care of their teeth when they're a teenager, so when they realize how embarrassing crooked teeth are and how it's preventing them from getting laid, who do they turn to to fix them? ALGN, that's who. Invisalign is the backbone of this nation.

SOXL is index fund of various tech and semiconductor companies. Semiconductors are super important for the whole world. Not like we're gonna be ditching phones and computers anytime soon and going back to abacuses so I feel like it's a great bet to continually invest in.

ETH is just a [wildcard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYtjpIwamos) at this point. 

I am not a financial advisor and I didn't spend 7000 years studying these companies before investing, so take what I say with a grain of salt.",courtjesters,47,/r/RobinHood/comments/liokgf/weekend_wtf_february_12th_2021/gn4c8y2/,0.081,0.797,0.122,0.8466
