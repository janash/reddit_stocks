I look for companies with a market cap between 1 and 10 billion dollars.  Put them all on a list.  I'll then do a Wiki search on them to read up about the companies and see which ones are doing something I already understand or care to learn more about.

Then I go to the companies' investor page on their website and I look over their earnings reports to see how well they are doing in QoQ and YoY performance, how much profit margin they are bringing in, how much debt they have compared to assets.

If I like what I see there then I'll find some ER calls and see how confident the executives are in their company and their forward guidance.

Keep in mind that if you're investing in low cap stocks then you have to stomach volatility.  These tickers will go up or down 10-20% some days and there's nothing in the news as to why because oftentimes the only reason is some big institutional investor decided to jump in or out of the stock.

6,RH," My lazy way of finding SOME companies is through Robinhood (note: transitioning my $ out of RH soon). Go to their search function, scroll through their categories, check the companies that catch your interest, and put it into a list (organize the list via date found/sector/intention to keep track like 2021/2/5_Tech_PotentiallyUndervalued). 

Then, research your findings. Products/services provided, consumer sentiment, investor relations page, balance sheet, investor sentiment/news reports, current and potential deals, the C-Suite, insider trading, employee reviews (Glassdoor) to name a few. Make a detailed report on the ones you want to buy. 

Note: You can't trade OTC on Robinhood. And there are some GREAT Canadian/international companies that you simply can't find on RH. Check out other platforms for long term trades (anything w/ a Roth IRA. TDAmeritrade, Fidelity, Webull).

Real advice: I would watch Roaring Kitty's (aka u/deepfuckingvalue) series on how he picks/evaluates stocks. 

He details his process, the sites he uses, and tools. It's a three hour crash course in evaluating and tracking potential stocks, and its changed my process entirely.

7,BABA," I research stocks that I am familiar with, businesses that I see and use every day, check their balance sheet, profitability, revenue growth etc.... 

Buy what institutions want to buy but aren't willing to take the risk as they have a duty to their investors to minimise risk. For example I invested in NEX.L (NATIONAL EXPRESS GROUP) during covid, institutions didn't want to touch it as it would be too risky even though the business was growing and profitable. as an individual I can afford to take slightly more risk and bought some up, now NEX is up around 120% from when I bought it. 

Alibaba took a massive hit when Jack ma went missing, and ANT IPO was cancelled, however the fundementals were unchanged, growth and revenue remained strong, of course it was in everyone's best interest to come to a mutual agreement between ant and the Chinese government which they have now, BABA up 10+%

Walmart: always does well during recession, investors flock to buy walmart.

Apple: great business, great revenue and growth. Consumers love apple products and pay a lot for them.

TLDR: think about products and services you use and trust, check the business that produces these products and services, is the business good? Is the value there?

9,BB," First, you need to determine what kind of trader you are looking to be. How risk averse are you? How long are you willing to keep your money in the market? This will help you inform your decisions from then on out.

Pay attention to what people are talking about and why. The more something is talked about, the more likely it is that the stock is seeing action now. This does NOT mean that the stock is necessarily a good investment. You should never invest in something just because others are doing it, you should never invest in something that you don't understand, and never invest money that you can't afford to lose. Seriously. If you have a $50,000 of total wealth, and $30k is tied up, you should never consider investing the entire $20k liquid amount that is on hand. Set limits on what you choose to put into your brokerage account.

""Be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful.""

This is a quote that I try and live by. GME has been a good example lately. I invested when others were fearful of its bankruptcy, months ago, and I sold when others were greedy, even though it felt like I was the only one selling and that I could be 'missing out' on lots of gains. Never FOMO into an investment. That's gambling, not investing

Next, once you have identified a company that is interesting, you have to research it and seek to full understand the company. This can be a daunting task, and should take a lot of effort. On average, I spend anywhere from 20 to 200 hours researching a company before deciding to invest. Don't invest in what you don't understand and always prioritize learning more over waiting less.

Next, if you are looking to value invest, consider a companies' balance sheet, history, management, and future market value. Is the company managing their finances well? Are there any alarming liabilities? Are they perceived well by the public and other investors? Are they consistently growing? Are they hiring new employees? How is their trading volume changing? Have they shifted their position in the market to be more competitive? Are they pursuing any new visions? Do they have any unique business moats? What are the strongest bullish and bearish analysis of the company? Read everything. Seek to understand everything. Ask questions. Find answers. Share your analysis. Receive feedback. Consider catalysts and make your own estimates for stock growth.

Then, once you have found something, do NOT go all in. Invest a speculative position. Once you learn more, and are more convicted regarding the stock, buy more. All of my large positions have started off as speculative positions that I continue to buy over time. No conviction = No monetization. 

This might be more than your question was asking, but I think it all relates.

15,UWMC," First, you need to determine what kind of trader you are looking to be. How risk averse are you? How long are you willing to keep your money in the market? This will help you inform your decisions from then on out.

Pay attention to what people are talking about and why. The more something is talked about, the more likely it is that the stock is seeing action now. This does NOT mean that the stock is necessarily a good investment. You should never invest in something just because others are doing it, you should never invest in something that you don't understand, and never invest money that you can't afford to lose. Seriously. If you have a $50,000 of total wealth, and $30k is tied up, you should never consider investing the entire $20k liquid amount that is on hand. Set limits on what you choose to put into your brokerage account.

""Be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful.""

This is a quote that I try and live by. GME has been a good example lately. I invested when others were fearful of its bankruptcy, months ago, and I sold when others were greedy, even though it felt like I was the only one selling and that I could be 'missing out' on lots of gains. Never FOMO into an investment. That's gambling, not investing

Next, once you have identified a company that is interesting, you have to research it and seek to full understand the company. This can be a daunting task, and should take a lot of effort. On average, I spend anywhere from 20 to 200 hours researching a company before deciding to invest. Don't invest in what you don't understand and always prioritize learning more over waiting less.

Next, if you are looking to value invest, consider a companies' balance sheet, history, management, and future market value. Is the company managing their finances well? Are there any alarming liabilities? Are they perceived well by the public and other investors? Are they consistently growing? Are they hiring new employees? How is their trading volume changing? Have they shifted their position in the market to be more competitive? Are they pursuing any new visions? Do they have any unique business moats? What are the strongest bullish and bearish analysis of the company? Read everything. Seek to understand everything. Ask questions. Find answers. Share your analysis. Receive feedback. Consider catalysts and make your own estimates for stock growth.

Then, once you have found something, do NOT go all in. Invest a speculative position. Once you learn more, and are more convicted regarding the stock, buy more. All of my large positions have started off as speculative positions that I continue to buy over time. No conviction = No monetization. 

This might be more than your question was asking, but I think it all relates.

Then go to options stats and see if someone bought huge number CALL contracts. If someone bought a $100k+ worth of CALL options... that person know something. Only dumb traders would bet a $100k without doing their DD.

For confirmation, I use my technical charts to see if there's an upside in the future. I like using Andrew's Pitchfork. I only trade with chart confirmation.

Then I buy the same CALL OPTIONS or for you... buy the stock.

29,FB," Look for news stories about companies you know which are going through a rough patch. The big brand name companies are rarely, if ever, permanently impaired by short term impacts. There are about 300 companies in the world that compound returns in their businesses in excess of 15% (ROIC = return on invested capital). Buy them when things are not going well in the short term.

Keep your eye out for emerging monopolies like Google and FB. When Google went public, everyone kind of new it was going to change the world but a lot of people did not want to pay 35x earnings for it. Bad call. 

Lastly, if you own any mutual funds, they have to reveal their holdings every quarter. If you have a mutual fund that has done really well, look at new positions the fund has started. See if the position grows over time.

The problem with short term trading is that, on average, most stocks move in price together.  There are times when an individual stock will take off separate from the market, like the EV makers last year.

But usually, when you buy a stock that then appreciates in value, at the time you choose to sell, most of the other stocks have risen in tandem.

""Who makes this for who?"" one of the biggest driving forces also is Semiconductors. So... I started looking at companies involved in that industry aswell and bought shares in companies who manufacture semiconductors or provide raw materials for semiconductors.

If course now it'd a big pain in the ass because what's happening between China and Taiwan. The pandemic also caused a shortage of semiconductors and obviously much of the world relies in Taiwan for its semiconductor manufacturing and supply. I had read an article that the EU and USA are going to start trying to manufacture their own semiconductor at some point because they realized that almost trhr entire world has reliance ON Taiwanese manufacturing.

I guess we will see how it goes.

So far even with the whole $GME thing, I didn't lose at all, I've been in the positive for two months now and it only goes up and up. I've invested at most maybe like $750 and my return at one point was 115% spread out across various companies. Some obviously doing better than others. And no I don't have stock in Tesla, Apple, Google, GME, or Amazon.",5A1DtheDevil,2,/r/stocks/comments/ldqxmv/how_do_you_discover_potential_stocks/gm8r7lz/,0.048,0.856,0.096,0.9138

44,ADN," I troll the SEC and look for insider trading flags. ADN might be an upcoming star. I do my due diligence. Research the owner, patents, who funds them, their potential/impact in industry, 

Then crunch the numbers on DTI, Quarterly Reports, etc. after all of the fundamental research has been completed.

45,ATR," I only watch the highest volume and volatility names. Volume allows for easy in/out and typically suggests better chart movement. Volatility makes trading that stock worth it. This criteria alone can narrow down a lot of stock from the market. I measure volatility with the ATR reading. Look for higher ATR readings for different price ranges and ignore the ones with lower ATR. It's much more efficient to trade a stock that's gonna move $2 say on the same set up vs a stock that's only expected to move 50 cents. 

Create a basket of these stocks for with whatever other criteria you want (price/low float) to scan through regularly looking for set ups/key levels that may make for great trades and set alerts. This is good way of finding stocks before they move but I also use scanners during day/after the close to find any big trends by scanning top % change since open, stock twits trending, and top RVOL names to find ""stocks in play"". Stocks in play will usually have a lot of retail and hedge fund traders watching them and this elevated volume makes for cleaner and larger moves on the chart regardless of the timeframe.",WolfOfPort,2,/r/stocks/comments/ldqxmv/how_do_you_discover_potential_stocks/gm94gzg/,0.024,0.859,0.118,0.936
46,DD,"  I ask myself questions. Because I'm smart and have no friends. So for example, a couple weeks ago I said to myself...

""Self? Will the virus ever end?""

""Yes. Just time will do it. All pandemics end. Plus vaccination helps a lot.""

""Who gets vaccinated first?""

""Old people.""

""What do Old people do as soon as they are vaccinated?""

""Go on a Cruise!""

""Ok Self... you're so smart. Based on that, what stock should I buy?""

""Humm... Carnival Cruise Lines maybe? They are huge and probably really beat up.""

""Ok... I'll look into that.""

Then I did some more DD and it turns out that Carnival has paired back and sold all the shitty ships and cut costs. Meh... could work.

I bought back when they were at $19.23. Friday they were up to $21.31. So that's good.

Plus I use luck. Thursday I asked ""Self... who's making that vaccine in India? I hear it's working out pretty good!"". Self didn't know so I googled. Turns out the manufacturer is a safer bet than the guys who invented the vaccine. I bought a pile of <REDACTED MICROCAP - Google it>.  How could that lose money? Then the Luck kicks in. Friday it went TO THE MOON! I bought at $3.25 on Thursday and sold after market Friday at $7. Could it go higher? Sure. But I'll take the win.

So do that. Be smart and lucky. Never fails.",Smirkydarkdude,3,/r/stocks/comments/ldqxmv/how_do_you_discover_potential_stocks/gm8h1mn/,0.041,0.779,0.18,0.9872

48,OR," I'm fairly new as well but I've been reading ""technical analysis of the financial markets"" and what my lazy ass came up with is that I'll but a stock if: the candles are higher than the EMA9, and the EMA 9 is higher than the MA25. In the RSI I usually work with a horizontal line in the number 50 as if it was a support or resistance (I don't know if that's how you call it in english). If I see it over it I'd check the volume. If I saw that theres a big green column I'd probably buy, but that's because I'm still studying and working with money I don't care to lose.   
From my entry point I'd usually put a SL at 3% OR lower than the EMA9, if a few days passes and the price is still under it I will sell, as I just keep stocks for a week or two. My exit strategy is just anything over 2% is ok. As it is what my broker charges me when I buy or sell, but I usually sell at 5-6% unless I'm sure it can still grow more in the next few weeks.

51,CEO," Exactly as others have said. Use Robinhood/Reddit/news articles to find some interesting names, then do your own research. Best places to research are:

- Company itself - every publicly listed company is required to have an investor relations site where they publish their results/management commentary etc. Google “company name investor relations” and it will come up. Read their most recent results presentation (probably not the SEC filings as they’re quite dry) from the CEO/management team etc. One thing is take the commentary with a pinch of salt - obviously by law they need to be accurate statements etc, but given this is management they will spin things in the best possible way they can get away with.

- Analyst recommendations/articles from sites like motley fool/seeking alpha. Again judge these skeptically as they can vary in quality, but by reading a few you’ll get an idea hopefully about the company.

- Reddit/social media - treat this the most skeptically as obviously it’s anonymous people posting online (who may have numerous motivations for pumping up a company).

REAL. One of my gfs favorite shopping sites. I have no doubt that as the world reopens, there’s going to be a surge of purchases as people get decked out for the office again. 

I bought BAC and T because I have as using their services. I’ve since dropped att wireless for Comcast yet continue to own this. I keep telling myself to sell. Hasn’t worked. Lol. 

eBay. Being locked in, I’ve spent more time looking to fill out old collections, mostly vinyl records. Saw their share price relative to earnings and thought this was a great opportunity. Doing well so far, they just increased their dividend. But time will tell. 

Others are work driven. Despite all the hype about AMD, only one user at work as requested a thread ripper machine. Everyone else asks for and gets Intel. Intel makes buckets of cash, I have a lot of faith that they’ll catch up again in part by deploying that money. 

ESTC. Another work related one. Just started dabbling with their tools and am pretty happy so far. I’m a bit worried that right after I invested, Amazon forked the project though. So that needs some reevaluation now.

Buy when others are fearful.

Take a look at LMT (Lockheed Martin) the business is solid with a huge backlog of work, but it has been selling off recently, maybe because biden as president and other opportunities such as tech boom , however fundementaly LMT is strong and profitable. Only recently bought by ark space fund. 

Institutions want to stay ahead of the game and will sell winners if it means they can look better on paper, they also cannot take as much risk as individual investors as they have a duty of care to their clients. 

We on the other hand can afford more risk as we are using our own money and not millions of paying customers' money so we can buy the stocks that are selling off based on fundementals, in the hope that eventually institutions will pick them back up when they feel safe to do so (i.e. when the future of the stock is a bit clearer / when the recent bad news becomes rectified) 

For example with alibaba, institutions had to sell the stock even though it was fundementaly solid, because there was some bad news about the ANT IPO , that's when I bought, then the ant IPO was clarified and amended and problem solved, institutions picked baba back up again because they felt safer to do so.

However, when I began following GME at this time, I was not convinced they were safe to invest in yet, because I felt that their business model still needed improving before I would feel safe enough investing.

Or least this was the speculation, so when he invested in Gamestop and sent his letter to the board, there was reason to believe that this was an indicator that Cohen was interested in something larger than buying low selling high., l) Cohen staked out 9.8%, an important value in that it was just below the cutoff to be considered a corporate investor.

Additionally, someone discovered at this time that Cohen and RC ventures had hired a top notch lawyer, that specialized in corporate shifts in management... not sure the legal term for this. However, this was huge and now indicated even more strongly that Cohen was looking to take over GME, and create a new vision for GME.

I went all in at this point, liquidating the rest of my portfolio and investing in GME. Was it certain that GME would successful change their business model and incorporate Cohen and his Chewy buddies into their business vision? No, but at that point it seemed more than likely, and there was both short term and long term momentum building. p) at this point, i was aware that GME was underevaluated by around 4x, and a fair market value should have been closer to $70 a share, conservatively.

Either way, it was a win win. k) The run up from 20 to 400 lacked in additional research and announcements, but seemed to be entirely related to price action, options, and large institutions, HFs, and whales getting involved.

Realistically, I figured that best case scenario GME could reach the 100s within a year or two, so after it soared past 300, I knew that there was no reason to keep my shares anymore. The additional market manipulation around this time scared me off, as I realized fundamental market knowledge could by privy to manipulation and thus could no longer be trusted.

Over the next 1-3 years, I would say GME will be worth anywhere from $150 to $250.

Although I believe my PTs are good targets, I can't currently afford to have a large position in GME because of the volatility, but I think I will invest again once it all settles down",UncleZiggy,7,/r/stocks/comments/ldqxmv/how_do_you_discover_potential_stocks/gm99n22/,0.054,0.819,0.127,0.9978

105,NOK," Lots of good advice here already, just thought I'd share with you what works for me. 

I usually do a stop loss at 7% from my purchase price, so 93% of my original investment. This is based on William O'Neil's advice on when to cut losses; obviously, there's a lot more volatility in the market these days. If you're investing in something like NOK, setting a 10% stop loss is okay if you think that's appropriate, the important thing is not changing tour stop loss when you see that stock dropping. This should be a decision you plan before you buy, not an emotional reaction.

When to take profits: I sell half my shares (on swing trades) when I'm up 20% no matter what. Then I'll set a limit for half of my remaining shares at 10% above that (30% above purchase) with a stop loss for all at 5% below (25% above purchase) and repeat the process. 

Example:

Buy 40 shares at $100

Stop-loss 40 shares at $93

Limit sell 20 shares at $120

Stop-loss 20 shares at $115

Limit 10 shares at $130

Stop-loss 10 shares at $125

Limit 10 shares at $140

You can change these to fit your style of trading. The key is consistency and having a plan to stick to. I've sold stuff when it hit 12% before because the RSI or something on the charts didn't look good and I wanted out of the trade. But don't sell without a reason, and don't hold because you're greedy or because you think it's going to bounce back from -30%",mountainredneck,2,/r/stocks/comments/ldqxmv/how_do_you_discover_potential_stocks/gm937kg/,0.098,0.756,0.146,0.9013

It has fallen from the number one selling EV to number three...or is it fourth now?  This will be repeated in every market as it faces competition from established auto makers rolling out their own EVs.

Tesla's solar business is a shitshow.  While people are initially attracted to the low quotes, they soon have to deal with the worst customer service in the industry.  We are talking about installers getting halfway through a job then not showing up.  That sort of shitshow.  Seriously, do a bit of research on people's experience with SolarCity and its reputation in the industry.  It really seems like Musk has spread himself too thin to properly manage.

Self driving cars are a decade off at least.  In fact, I would not be surprised to see Tesla sued for unfulfilled promises.  People have paid money for a full self driving package that has yet to appear and certainly will not be delivered before those who paid for it get rid of their vehicles.

Anyway, I found out this gem after WSB started posting bunch of DDs in January. Started looking into it and realized that it’s actually a very sold long term investment. If it didn’t get caught in the crossfire of GME/AMC between wsb and wall street, it should have been hovering around $20 for now.

I would suggest buying at least some $BB now since it dropped from $30 in just a week due to manipulation from WallStreet.

386,BB," First of all, there are too many post about BB, which advocates how great this stock is. Obviously somebody tries to pump this stock, what should be kind of first alarm.

&#x200B;

Here some copy-paste from my previous comments regarding BB:

BB  has zero ""BUY"" from analyst in more then a year.

If this is so fantastic stock why top price from Wall Street analytics put price 9$ with average 7.86$? Or all of this analytics are so stupid that they can't see what you guys see in this stock?

Several insiders sold recently big amount of stocks, if this is such a great company, why CFO and others is selling now, why he can't wait till end of this year?

This company is loosing a lot of money and I don't see any positive sign, all this partnerships already priced in in the stock price.

I read through the comments, and other SE redditors seemed to have disagreed with his points. If I understood correctly, though the trend is for OEMs to move towards Android instead of QNX, 
1. Automakers are moving the *infotainment system* part to Android (b/c better app ecosystem)
2. The automotive part of the car will be running on QNX bc Android was not designed to run safety critical systems and is likely not capable (for now) to do so
3. Almost all OEMs that launch budget vehicles will still use QNX for the foreseeable future simply because the hardware is cheaper (and available now, instead of having to spend years and m/billions on development) 

I really appreciate you sharing the post though. I like to read both sides and stay informed; it helps me stay level-headed on BB.",schnapsidee_,10,/r/stocks/comments/ldrjcl/what_are_your_guyss_thoughts_on_bb/gm87hzt/,0.045,0.823,0.132,0.9226

AMZN - Got dozens of buy ratings six months ago (around $4000 mark in 12 months) and has been pretty stagnant ($3300 today).

Thanks for the critique.

I am well aware that ARK has multiple funds. Maybe I shouldn’t have said “ARKK”, but I’m specifically referring to the ARK Investment Funds in general; not just the ARKK fund.

Cathie normally buys all her positions in small increments. She never goes all in when adding stocks to her funds. I know this because I get ARK daily updates emailed to me. She added SKLZ to her portfolio at least twice in January: once on Jan 19 and once on Jan 28.

Unfortunately you're choosing to share in a forum that is overloaded right now with misinformation.   Both purposeful and accidental.  Being accurate is important.

Even in your response, you show some key misunderstandings.

Cathie may not have initiated/added those sklz purchases.  She has a team at ARK.  She does not oversee every trade in every fund.  Now I'll be clear that I don't know the specifics, and no one probably does outside of those on that team, but it would be more accurate to say ""Ark"" instead of Cathie.  It's very possible she had no more than a brief overview before a small starter position was taken in one of their smaller funds.   

Either way...""buying like crazy"" is so far from a reasoble interpretation.   Over the last two months, Ark was buying TDOC ""LIKE CRAZY"".  Multiple buys across 4 (I think) of their funds including their Flagship.  Making it a Top position in many of their funds including Arkk and the #1 position in ARKG.  That is buying like crazy.

434,TSLA," I think stocks are very overvalued from a P/E perspective. (Seriously, why is TSLA trading at over 1200x earnings?!) However, I can not predict when the trend is going to turn. My timing is terrible. 

One market that does appear to be turning that I am taking advantage of is the US long bond market. People are currently lending money to the US Gov't for 20 years at about 1.75%. In my opinion, with the amount of money printing going on (the US created over 20% of all money in existence in the last 12 months) there is no way that the 1.75% even covers inflation. I have taken a position in a leveraged ETF that goes up 3x whatever the long bond goes down (TMV).

442,AMZN," P/E ratio is the Price to Earnings ratio.

For example, with TSLA, people are paying about 1200 times the earnings associated with each share. That means, if TSLA stays the exact same size and earns exactly what they do today, your share will repay the money that you invested in it over the next 1200 years. This is longer than my time horizon. People are hoping that the earning increase to make them back their money in a shorter period, however, I personally don't buy it.

Even Amazon is trading at 80 times earnings. That means at the current rate it takes 80 years to break even on your investment. I think it should have a P/E of about 20, which means AMZN would have to quadruple their earnings. It's such a massive company I don't see how they can become 4 times larger/more profitable.",wyle_e,2,/r/stocks/comments/le013m/anybody_else_feel_like_we_are_in_a_bubble_with_a/gm8vpyv/,0.0,0.903,0.097,0.9022

450,RTX, I was accumulating shares of RTX when it was in the 50s.  Unfortunately for this thing to really drive significantly higher they need their commercial aerospace industry to pick up. I expect it will be a few years before that recovers. If you have a longer time horizon this is probably a good buy if it dips under 70.

452,GME," Was bullish on Sony since last year and currently kicking myself for selling my stock to go in on GME before I wait for my funds to settle so I can reinvest in them. A lot of what I'm saying is reiterating on your points, but this is additional information that may help.

Sony is currently the dominant force in gaming. Nintendo is no longer a direct competitor to Sony and occupies its own adjacent niche, and Xbox is starting this generation off extremely far behind. Microsoft has made some big moves with Xbox, chief among them being pushing Game Pass, XCloud, and acquiring Bethesda, so I expect them to up the competition long term, but atm the PS5 currently has greater sales, greater hype, stronger short-term optics with upcoming games, and overall better momentum at the moment. Supply shortages are no longer a concern as what Sony is likely doing is intentionally restricting supply to increase hype, which will lead to even stronger sales long term.

Crunchyroll acquisition is massive given the strong market for Japanese content in the West and CR's status as one of the two major players along with Funimation. Crunchyroll, along with being the premiere anime streaming service, is also a major supplier of anime/manga/game themed merchandise and is a major presence in the community through both their own expo and a strong presence in others. Buying out Crunchyroll gives Sony a major foothold in that market, in turn empowering their potential as a streaming company.

I can't speak to the promise of their mobile division, Bravia phones are not major contenders in that space. No matter how good they are, I'm skeptical of how likely they are to break out of their niche in a world dominated by iPhones, Galaxies, OnePluses, LG Gs, etc. Sony's tech is otherwise solid and there's a lot of potential for their application in various spaces, and they maintain a strong presence in various markets like TVs, DSLR cameras, video editing tools, etc.

Altogether I expect Sony to maintain its rise throughout this year and (maybe a little farfetched) I would not be surprised if it managed to reach close to, if not break, $200 by year's end.",hehehehehehahahahaha,7,/r/stocks/comments/ldqd9o/sony_sne_up_16_after_earnings_initial_thoughts/gm7hbqh/,0.047,0.824,0.129,0.9868

456,EV," Sony's foray into anime is welcome, but reactive. They're a few years late with Netflix already taking a significant chunk of the anime streaming pie, and competition in that space is heating up. They ended up paying a large premium for Crunchyroll (compared to the $143m they paid for Funimation in 2017), but it may turn out to be a good investment in the future *if* Sony's management is ambitious enough. The main challenge will be turning those 100m users into paid subscribers, that'll be a tough challenge in a market rampant with piracy and with only 4m subscribers currently. As I said, they'll need to be ambitious in their management and integration of Aniplex, Crunchyroll, and Funimation and I have my worries that Sony Music and Sony Pictures may spend more time fighting for control of the anime segment than cooperating and merging their assets. I'd like to see anime become an entirely seperate division of Sony in the next few years.

The Crunchyroll acquisition is the forerunner to two other trends within Sony's larger strategy though. The first is the move to smaller, more specialised streaming platforms. Sony rightfully knows they don't have the mainstream IP to support a full Netflix competitor, but with the acquisition of Crunchyroll and Pure Flix (christian netflix) they're setting themselves up in smaller less well served market segments - I think it's a good plan personally with a lot of room for growth and away from major competition with other streamers. In the case of anime, more mainstream players like Netflix may even compliment Sony's anime bet, providing a mainstream platform to introduce new audiences to anime (which will then be drawn to the more dedicated Sony platform).

The other trend is the One Sony concept. One Sony is Kenichiro Yoshida's effort to improve cooperation between Sony's divisions, which are notoriously hostile to each other. Anime has cross-segment appeal not just in film and TV, but in music, merchandising, and games. If Sony can realise a cross-segment approach to the anime business between Sony Music, Sony Pictures, and Sony Interactive Entertainment that would be a huge win not just for anime, but for future cooperation between their divisons. The recent announcement that the Demon Soul game will be available on PC and Xbox as well as PS5/4 is concerning though, and shows we're not quite there. Sony's divisions have a lot of synergies, but they're stubbornly intent on not using them.

I'm not convinced their EV is anything more than a marketing stunt to draw attention to the Sony technologies under the hood. Even so, EVs are a huge opportunity for Sony's CMOS business and would be a massive future growth opportunity if they can pull it off. Especially with Samsung's own sensor business breathing down Sony's neck, competition in this space is heating up and fending off Samsung will be a major challenge for Sony. 

I'm not confident on Sony's mobile strategy, I think Sony will be happy to make a few million phones and be profitable at this point. The whole electronics division needs a complete overhaul when it comes to marketing, but for mobile it's likely too late.

In terms of gaming, they're dominant in that space but there's a fair few challenges they'll have to face. The first is the consolidation of the industry, which apart from a failed acquisition of Leyou, Sony seems to be sitting out of for the time being while Microsoft and Tencent build a formidible selection of studios. While it's bad for the consumer, Sony needs to react and respond or they'll find an ever increasing number of old partner studios and publishers no longer publish on their platform. Honestly I think the consolidation of the industry by more ambitious and capitalised competitors is the biggest risk for PlayStation in the medium term. 

Gamepass is the other risk, but honestly I don't think it's a massive one. Sony is content growing their 47m PS+ subscribers, which in all likelihood has far higher profit margins than Gamepass. They have PS Now, and I hope they're looking to overhaul that service to complement PS+, but it's not an immediate concern. Sony (and even moreso Nintendo) are the kings of content, and can create a strong Gamepass competitor overnight by placing their games on the service day and date. When that becomes economically viable, or a necessary step, then I think we'll see Sony quickly catch up and probably overtake Gamepass. Sony is the Disney to Microsoft's Netflix in the gaming space right now. I don't think not owning cloud infrastructure is a big problem (it's not a problem for Netflix and Disney), and as cloud infrastrucutre becomes increasingly commoditised it'll be even less so in the 10+ years it will take for cloud gaming to take off.",LordCastlereagh,1,/r/stocks/comments/ldqd9o/sony_sne_up_16_after_earnings_initial_thoughts/gm88ena/,0.052,0.805,0.143,0.9975

They have PS Now, and I hope they're looking to overhaul that service to complement PS+, but it's not an immediate concern. Sony (and even moreso Nintendo) are the kings of content, and can create a strong Gamepass competitor overnight by placing their games on the service day and date. When that becomes economically viable, or a necessary step, then I think we'll see Sony quickly catch up and probably overtake Gamepass.

458,PS," Sony's foray into anime is welcome, but reactive. They're a few years late with Netflix already taking a significant chunk of the anime streaming pie, and competition in that space is heating up. They ended up paying a large premium for Crunchyroll (compared to the $143m they paid for Funimation in 2017), but it may turn out to be a good investment in the future *if* Sony's management is ambitious enough. The main challenge will be turning those 100m users into paid subscribers, that'll be a tough challenge in a market rampant with piracy and with only 4m subscribers currently. As I said, they'll need to be ambitious in their management and integration of Aniplex, Crunchyroll, and Funimation and I have my worries that Sony Music and Sony Pictures may spend more time fighting for control of the anime segment than cooperating and merging their assets. I'd like to see anime become an entirely seperate division of Sony in the next few years.

The Crunchyroll acquisition is the forerunner to two other trends within Sony's larger strategy though. The first is the move to smaller, more specialised streaming platforms. Sony rightfully knows they don't have the mainstream IP to support a full Netflix competitor, but with the acquisition of Crunchyroll and Pure Flix (christian netflix) they're setting themselves up in smaller less well served market segments - I think it's a good plan personally with a lot of room for growth and away from major competition with other streamers. In the case of anime, more mainstream players like Netflix may even compliment Sony's anime bet, providing a mainstream platform to introduce new audiences to anime (which will then be drawn to the more dedicated Sony platform).

The other trend is the One Sony concept. One Sony is Kenichiro Yoshida's effort to improve cooperation between Sony's divisions, which are notoriously hostile to each other. Anime has cross-segment appeal not just in film and TV, but in music, merchandising, and games. If Sony can realise a cross-segment approach to the anime business between Sony Music, Sony Pictures, and Sony Interactive Entertainment that would be a huge win not just for anime, but for future cooperation between their divisons. The recent announcement that the Demon Soul game will be available on PC and Xbox as well as PS5/4 is concerning though, and shows we're not quite there. Sony's divisions have a lot of synergies, but they're stubbornly intent on not using them.

I'm not convinced their EV is anything more than a marketing stunt to draw attention to the Sony technologies under the hood. Even so, EVs are a huge opportunity for Sony's CMOS business and would be a massive future growth opportunity if they can pull it off. Especially with Samsung's own sensor business breathing down Sony's neck, competition in this space is heating up and fending off Samsung will be a major challenge for Sony. 

I'm not confident on Sony's mobile strategy, I think Sony will be happy to make a few million phones and be profitable at this point. The whole electronics division needs a complete overhaul when it comes to marketing, but for mobile it's likely too late.

In terms of gaming, they're dominant in that space but there's a fair few challenges they'll have to face. The first is the consolidation of the industry, which apart from a failed acquisition of Leyou, Sony seems to be sitting out of for the time being while Microsoft and Tencent build a formidible selection of studios. While it's bad for the consumer, Sony needs to react and respond or they'll find an ever increasing number of old partner studios and publishers no longer publish on their platform.

460,EV," Thanks for sharing, interesting to hear more about Crunchyroll as I only know them as a ln anime streaming service. Your $200 is very bullish, I can see it as a possibility if their EV has a few announcements but that's much higher than I was looking at for the year, but we'll see when I crunch the numbers.

I like Sony as a mobile play and I think people are viewing it both without the context of Huawei being out of the game and their new direction. The phones have done decently in Japan and Sony seems to actually be listening to feedback to improve and not going with the trends (like keeping the headphone jack). Arguably two of the biggest tech reviewers on YouTube have started to mention the phones (mkbhd & unbox therapy) so I think this year it will get a bit of hype.

Huwawei phones were great, but a lot of people got them because they wanted something different than iPhones and Galaxies. The cinema pro modes for Sony's camera are pretty cool although very niche but they give their cameras extra versatility. I hope their software continues to improve to take full advantage and make them easy to use without the camera pro settings. The key thing for the average consumer is the 4K screens and 120htz refresh (rumors for next model) which is massive, especially for mobile gamers. Obviously I could be wrong, but it is something to keep an eye on over their next two earnings (depending on release date) and can keep interest alive throughout the year.",Japanda23,3,/r/stocks/comments/ldqd9o/sony_sne_up_16_after_earnings_initial_thoughts/gm7j8vi/,0.023,0.804,0.173,0.9921
461,CORE," Why no faith in their mobiles? I am actually super bullish on their recovery here but I would like to hear the counter argument. Their new phones are a bit niche atm, but they're moving in the right direction. I hope they can bring the price down a bit but I'm watching the Xperia 1 iii leaks as it's a contender for my next phone. I think the price is their biggest drawback and still a bit technical for the average consumer but I also believe people are looking for something other than a galaxy and iphone and the Xperia can be a good option if it gets noticed (Youtube influencers are mentioning it a bit these days).

As for CORE I don't know enough about it yet and I do see your point about cloud gaming. I'll hopefully be able to give a more solid answer after this weekend. For now, I think cloud gaming isn't the immediate future even if it is the future. Sony offers a form of it now (Playstation Now) even if it isn't the best. I find it difficult to believe Sony isn't looking into how to compete here in the future (should be coming to PS5). If Core is as fast and seamless as they claim I see this being a good transition into cloud gaming for Sony too if the tech can carry over as the biggest drawback to cloud gaming / central server style gaming is the delay, especially for multiplayer games. I see huge possibility in Sony being able to bridge this gap if they chose to go that route. I admit this is pure speculation at this point, but I also don't see it as something that brings the value down short term. Rather something to keep an eye on over the next couple years as the landscape develops. All that said, Gaming is only a part of their business and Core would be an added bonus if it works (I see it taking off more in Japan/Asia before adoption in the West).",Japanda23,3,/r/stocks/comments/ldqd9o/sony_sne_up_16_after_earnings_initial_thoughts/gm7gc5y/,0.044,0.844,0.112,0.9726
462,PS," Long term Sony will face strong competition from a Microsoft free of Don Mattrick and his sinful ways. Game Pass is on its way to Netflix-ify games, XCloud is a strong cloud gaming platform in its current state that's betting on the Switch's ""Play Anywhere"" mantra, and with smart acquisitions like Bethesda, Xbox could significantly undercut Sony's presence.

However, in the short term, Sony definitely has the lead and it won't be shrinking for at least the next year or two. A strong slate of upcoming exclusives, massive hype generated from intentionally limited supply (they most definitely had more, but low supply increases demand further), and a massive headstart from last gen will keep them going for the time being.

I do personally have my doubts about cloud gaming and how effective it will be, since a lot of it is contingent on people's internet infrastructure and, at least in the US, internet infrastructure is a joke. Stadia stumbled through its first year, but now that next gen is here, I doubt it will last much longer. The experience of playing on Stadia is noticeably worse for many than on a dedicated console, and with next gen already here, all eyes are on PS and Xbox. In turn, I doubt AWS will be able to secure a spot for itself unless it manages to overcome many of the issues that plagued Stadia and the average person has access to functional internet, and by then Sony may well have fixed their cloud gaming issues (psnow is a total joke lol).",hehehehehehahahahaha,0,/r/stocks/comments/ldqd9o/sony_sne_up_16_after_earnings_initial_thoughts/gm7mqqt/,0.077,0.784,0.138,0.9229

Stadia may be moving to AV1 in a year or two, which should give them even better bandwidth savings/more fidelity.

466,AR," Experienced mobile publisher here, launched a few games, reaching 100+ millions of downloads. 

Unity owns game development software leadership. But makes a tiny revenue out of it. 65%+ of its revenue is from ads. IDFA change led by Apple is still a bit unpredictable. My guess is that it should create a minor drop in revenue. Casual gaming publishers relies not that much on targeting. Hypercasual won’t be affected. Casino + midcore will suffer. If I were you, I would wait a bit until we have a better idea of the impact. 

Unity is still an amazing company, with a beautiful product. But the current value is certainly high. 

It is a long term play in my opinion, but the « dip » might continue over the next days / weeks. 

Moreover, don’t forget that the market size of AR/VR is still small. Yes, unity is strong tool in that space, but it is a small source of revenue. They acquired a few companies in that space, but the market is not mature enough to drive their growth significantly.

Unity should go deeper into publishing & analytics for new short term revenue streams. (Currently creating a mobile publisher entity ! )

Disclosure : owning a few shares. Not planning to add more until more info comes concerning Apple IDFA change.",Lyonrra,18,/r/stocks/comments/lds7w8/unity_software_u_is_looking_good/gm844pl/,0.047,0.797,0.156,0.9654
467,IMO," I'm coming at this from the perspective of someone who uses Unity rather than purely from a financial perspective, but I wouldn't touch their stock with a bargepole. 

Their product has been declining in quality from a developer's perspective for years. [74% of their revenue comes from customers making >$100k/yr](https://i2.wp.com/fourweekmba.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-04-at-23.19.18.png?resize=1024%2C303&ssl=1) and this is the group that is most likely to move away from Unity in the near future IMO. I know people in 3 small-medium sized game studios that fit that category and all 3 are considering an Unreal Engine switch in the near future due to the engine's quality. 

They have a foothold in the casual games space, but again I'd argue it's a very weak one. The technology is more demanding than it needs to be and costs more than it's really worth for what it does. My point is that from a user's perspective, there's not really much to keep me using Unity and there's not much to protect them from users moving to a different platform in the near future.

While Epic Games is private so direct comparisons may not be entirely accurate, they half a valuation only half of Unity's, despite bringing in 8x the revenue and having positive earnings ($730 million) vs Unity's $160 million loss. On top of that, they have a growing store which is bringing in a significant amount of revenue, an engine that caters for both small-medium companies as well as AAA companies and a product that is improving over time rather than getting worse. Features like nanite and lumen, as much as they have buzzword names, are real game changers.

I know I've come at this from the perspective of a user moreso than just from the investment potential, but like I said, I'm not touching their stock. If Epic Games IPOd tomorrow at half the marketcap of Unity though, I'd be all over it.",Absolut_Unit,8,/r/stocks/comments/lds7w8/unity_software_u_is_looking_good/gm8fzov/,0.06,0.843,0.097,0.8856

A) this is pretty much entirely due to the Slack acquisition. The market senses that if Slack, with better growth numbers, is so blocked by Microsoft that it has no choice but to throw in the towel, then Dropbox can’t be far behind.

B) The stock has had a couple of similar runs in the past but always gets dragged down after earnings. They have been beating estimates every time but the revenue growth percentage just gets smaller and smaller.

It’s a good company but if it doesn’t get bought soon it will probably end up a decent dividend stock like NLOK. If it does get bought my guess is the acquirer would be Zoom.

Ecosystems is what will make/break both products, and Apple already has a massive lead there.   

> The cost of Peloton isn't that crazy if you consider that it's a full gym replacement for most people.   

Nobody said Peloton was too expensive. What I said is that they're competing with competitors who can use their existing ecosystem to offer similar products at massive discounts for consumers. Consumers may already own a shitty no-name bike/treadmill, they can throw on an Apple Watch and get started with Fitness+ for almost no additional cost, relative to the thought of spending thousands getting started with Peloton.

Biometric feedback is neat, but I don't think most people are motivated to work out by it. How many hardcore gym goers even get into biometrics? I think Peloton's competitive and social aspects and personality cult around their trainers is much more motivating to the average user (but I could be wrong here - I have no hard evidence either way). 

The Peloton subscription is also available without the hardware btw, so I don't really understand your second paragraph. The hardware-less Peloton subscription (digital membership) is the direct substitute to Apple Fitness +, and is competitively priced at USD 13. Nothing stops you from downloading the Peloton app and getting started with your shitty no-name bike.

Buying long calls or puts you are only risking what you spent. Though, do be aware of pin risk there IE on the day of expiration if the stock goes up after hours you’ve signed a contract to buy 100 shares per contract at that strike price and it will be exercised. Make sure to sell your options before CoB Friday of expiry.

RobinHood does avoid this for you by auto closing out positions at 3:45 day of expiration if you don’t have enough cash to exercise. This can seem shady if you didn’t realize they do this but it is actually fully explained in their TOS and they do this to protect themselves - if you end up with 100 shares you couldn’t afford to buy and they gap down they’re the ones on the hook.

As others noted, be careful of the wash rule (selling a stock at a loss then immediately rebuying it) and note that if you have short term capital gains, you will owe taxes at ordinary income tax brackets. If you were super successful, as an example, the profits could push your income into the highest marginal tax bracket so keep this in mind if you are trading in the short term (<1 year holding periods). 

You can use capital losses to offset capital gains and if the amount is large enough you can carry 3,000 of it to offset ordinary income on federal taxes.

661,SHO," I think it's important to point out that most of that section of the wikipedia entry was based on an article written before the current naked short selling restrictions went into place. The end of the page also basically notes that Reg SHO in large part handled the issues being complained about.
Source on the rules that were implemented- https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2009/2009-172.htm

As to why the DTCC doesn't do forced buy ins, like tper said, not really what theyre there for and they don't have the regulatory authority to do something like that. They can however keep the cash supposed to be delivered to the FTD orignator and maintain it as collateral until the transaction does get settled. Reg SHO Rule 204 is the close out requirement which actually puts broker dealers as responsible for closing out these FTDs. The ""forever"" IOU situations effectively no longer exist with the rules in place.

The source below is a really good academic walk through of the purpose and mechanisms of the org, it's a bit dated but the functions of the DTCC remain the same.  (Pgs 7-8)

They say theyve added a circuit and have only given 13 days to resolve FTDs. They fail to say how, and if ever, they enforce this. ""forever"" IOUs definitely still exist with the lack of enforcement.

>As to why the DTCC doesn't do forced buy ins, like tper said, not really what theyre there for and they don't have the regulatory authority to do something like that.

663,SHO," But it does say how they enforce the rule. (SEC press release) Clearing brokers have 13 days to buy in on FTDs of threshold securities. Failure to do so can lead to fines, which you can see releases on. Looking at recent stories, a lot look to be caused by tech/procedural issues. So as for failure to enforce it, where is that happening?

On the ""forever IOUs"", Im willing to look into any evidence youve got they still exist, but I don't see it.  If they never closed, then logically they'd stay on the threshold list forever and it'd be blatantly obvious.

Low rates incentivize people to refi, which is where companies like RKT and UWMC make most of their money. When the rush to refi ends, most of the mortgage business will be for new construction and new purchase loans, where the main players are the big banks. When interest rates go back up, RKT and UMWC will get slaughtered. 

They can try to package themselves as fintech, but that’s not how Wall Street sees it. They’re old school mortgage originators who just happen to have slick apps. Eventually, they’ll have their lunch eaten by the big banks. Wall Street likes growth, not an impending train wreck.

That's not true, the companies are vastly different. RKT is a consumer driven mortgage originator, RKT deals with people like you or I and attempts to fund and approve the loan. UWMC is a broker dealer, and deals primarily with the loan officers and lending companies directly. That share of the market sphere (broker dealers) peaked in 2008 and has subsequently fell and leveled off in 2014 at 14%. Its currently been rising for the last 7 years at a rate of 1-2% per year. Broker dealers like UWMC dealt with roughly 20% of the mortgage market in 2019 and will capture an estimated 21% in 2020 and return to the peak 33% by an estimated 2026. I don't know about RKT, but the average customer whom gets a loan through UWMC has a credit score of 757 and a DTI ratio of 36%. Pretty solid customers. Their Refi volume obviously will shrink, but they should continue to capture more of the original home loans as broker dealers continue to regain market sphere, plus they are now looking to target jumbo loans

They have an industry leading close time (twice as fast as rocket, 3x as fast as industry average) and have one of the highest NPS scores in the industry. They have insane margins and their cost to originate the loans are much lower than the retail sector (RKT) They also pay a good dividend. If you bought at 10/share you'd make 4% on your return irrelevant of stock price. Hard not to be exited about that.

Great backstory too taking his father's 35 year old family-owned business of three employees to over 8,000 today.  He also provided close to $40million in stock to employees prior to going public.  The headquarters is in MI which is great to see it shine with the economic struggles MI has had going back to the great recession with the auto industry and such. 

The other piece I like is that UWMC works with independent brokers so in addition to directly supporting 8,000 employees the company is indirectly supporting many many other entities and jobs.

UWMC's ability to write mortgages so much faster than the traditional entities is a key advantage.  Also now with going public the company will be able to invest more heavily in tech.

The CEO is a former college athlete and he has that raw passion and desire to win.

730,GME," What you are describing is the [greater fool theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_fool_theory) and yes, it is the main/only driver behind stock prices of companies which do not distribute dividends. Despite this theory makes it sound like a scam, owning a share of a company has intrinsic value, it's not just a pyramid scheme.

To pick an extremely recent example, consider GME. Earlier this year, Ryan Cohen used his 13% ownership of GME to ""take control"" of the company. There you have ""true"" value, you're paying money in order to be able to control a company.

Now, you might think that this argument only works for large investors. Nobody cares about your opinion if you own 10 shares of GME, so why are they worth anything? The answer lies in arbitrage. If controlling 10% of a company is worth $500mm then, necessarily, owning 1% must cost $50mm, and owning 0,000001% must be worth 50 bucks. Even though you won't have a say if you only own  0,000001% of a company, its price must be consistent with other prices.",Perrin_Pseudoprime,1,/r/stocks/comments/ldk8zp/question_about_how_stocks_work/gm7ximt/,0.066,0.811,0.123,0.7798

741,GME," Hi, I’m sort of cross posting this here, because it’s relevant and I want to generate more interest in it.

I suspect the blame game on citadel, melvin, robinhood et al is a red herring.

The silver pump was genuine fake news published Sunday evening that referred to events on Monday (in the future).

The second largest holder of SlV is CTC, llc, the Chicago trading company.

The managing director of CTC is Frank Bednarz.

Frank was managing director of Goldman Sachs 1999 - 2005

Conveniently he left in 2005 and according to his linked in has a gap in his employment history between 2005 and 2008, the exact time period the 2008 financial crisis hit.

The guardian - ‘Goldman Sachs will pay $5.06bn for its role in the 2008 financial crisis, the US Department of Justice said on Monday. The settlement, over the sale of mortgage-backed securities from 2005 to 2007, was first announced in January.’

He has then been at CTC since 2008, when the shit hit the fan.

Digging further, CTC have holdings in all the big players, but notably, a large amount in Amazon. How curious, if we can now draw a link between GameStop -> Reddit(WSB) -> Silver -> CTC -> Amazon. What happened and why did the GME stock squeeze so much? Why was it shorted so much in the first place?

752,AMC, Invested 350 shares. One month ago AMC was in debt and scrambling to stay out of bankruptcy. They needed to find 750 million dollars on the ground. They managed to reduce their debts and secure some money right before the stock rocketed. When it rocketed they created 45 million shares and generated 600 million dollars to pay off their debt. They essentially wiped clean years of unhealthy business practices off their books. Because they diluted their stock the value plummeted. You are now seeing the stock find a new balancing point as people continue to buy up the shares. The company has literally done a 180 in terms of finances. If you are holding for the long term there is zero reason to back out now.

- Invest in your dilapidated cinemas to rejuvenate the industry
- Adopt some of the many innovations international companies are adopting (e.g. my local cinema company is doing quite well in the pandemic on account of having a streaming service as well).

784,PDT," Put all the money in index funds. Then save up new money and start speculating with it. Pick a ratio of “gambling” money, like 20% of your total.

Your safe pillar lets you speculate. If you win with your speculation, transfer all of it to your funds and reallocate for a new gambling fund. 

If you lose a speculative bet, wait and re-save up that 20% or whatever amount you decide on and only then re-gamble.

Doing this accomplishes two things. 

One, it means you learn to speculate but it trains muscles so when you do make a bet bet ( you will) you won’t blow up your whole account. You can speculate and keep accumulating.

Two, and this is big - having a safety pillar be most of your account opens options up to you with your account you will be risking if you speculate with all of it. PDT restrictions, higher margin, etc. 

I understand you’re young, but consider that long term investments starting small now and maintained over the next decade will turn into a million very rapidly with the magic of compound interest.
