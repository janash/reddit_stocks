Why would we assume that they haven’t already closed short positions that moved against them? And why would we assume that these same hedge funds that are alleged to currently have heavy short positions in AMC aren’t now profiting from the long game on AMC right alongside all the retail traders

21,AMC," > I would recommend to everyone to at least acknowledge that a short squeeze is potentially happening

God damn the definiton short squeeze has lost all possible meaning.

That being said we would need more evidence that someone is getting caught with their pants off, as in not hedging their positions and have more money in there than they can actually afford.

short share availability and fee rate indicates that its not as crazy as some people make it out to be. People will probably open new short positions at the peaks all the time, as long as they are right in set amount of time, they will make their money.

It would definitely start being interesting if AMC just keeps doubling its stock price or stays sideways at the peak. If GME in January is any indicator, we can definitely consider everything if it doubles at least one more time, you don't get margin called or are forced to liquidate if the stock price just increased for few days, and even then as i said gotta know their positions in the AMC, maybe they are a complete speck in comparison to their financials.

I doubt that any of the big companies are going to flash crash enough for it to be worth waiting for, first of all there is going to be buyers, and second of all it will all amount to few % of decrease in stock for them best case scenario, if you happen to have spare money in sideways good for you, but for example selling your positions now and waiting for it will result in murphys law where you end up buying these companies back at higher prices.",DarkRooster33,18,/r/stocks/comments/nr1dkn/beware_of_what_amc_shorts_are_holding/h0e71zo/,0.032,0.901,0.068,0.752

29,TSLA," This post is kinda misleading. It doesn’t distinguish whether the “long” positions are actual securities or whether they are derivatives. In the case of Citadel Advisors, you show them having two positions in TSLA. That’s because Citadel has a *lot* of leverage and TSLA just so happens to be one of the option positions they hold. The reason there are 2 separate positions is because they own calls *and* puts. So to say this is what will tank is quite misleading.

They will not sell their delta hedging inventory in response to a short squeeze in another name ... They don't care.

I have about 70% of my portfolio YOLO’d in them. They make the best solar panels around, and have a pedigree (spin-off from SunPower).

They are heavily kept down by their abysmal margins, but a little known fact is that those bad margins are due to a legacy contract for out-of-market polysilicon at 3x market price. If not for that contract, they would be profitable.

This contract will expire in 2022, so starting Q1 2023, their earnings will have a sudden jump. My plan is to keep buying low until 2023 and retire on the money from all the FOMO caused by their sudden increase of earnings.

They are also planning to expand into higher-margin businesses, such as services instead of just manufacturing. It remains to be seen if they will manage, but even without that, I think it will turn out great.",karakter98,2,/r/stocks/comments/nrc7tm/companies_no_one_is_talking_about/h0gy8k8/,0.047,0.838,0.115,0.891

Biggest pluses: Silica, silicon, and tons of growth potential.

Biggest detractions: debt. All stemming from a board member being called sexist towards a housekeeper, and causing the stock and company to tank.

Debt was restructured in march, and is looking to be paid off before it comes due in 2026. They have cash on hand, a 58% debt ratio, and it's going down.

262,AGCO," Some great stocks that I've been following since July 2020 that I think are just solid plays:

AGCO - Agriculture equipment manufacturing company. They're up 200% since July 2020, and have crossed into 52week high territory. they just pulled back for some consolidation, but could see another breakout. Lots of room to grow, and investing in agriculture can help bring diversification to your portfolio.

TEX - Heavy equipment machinery company. Great play if you're betting on infrastructure expansion and projects. Good company with good fundamentals.

PLCE - Children's clothing. This is going to be super hot this summer, and with wide vaccinations we're seeing lots of travel and school reopening. Kids who have been stuck at home for the past 18 months are now going to be outfitted by their parents in clothing that doesn't have holes in it. A lot of their growth may be priced in, but they're a great niche player thats been on a solid trajectory.

BGFV - Sporting goods store. More volatile, but you can see that their revenues are sky rocketing as everyone is ready to break free of the burden of lockdown. DSG is similar in this vein, but BGFV could see more growth.

COF - Financial company that primarily draws revenue through credit cards and financial instruments. Just announced a quarterly dividend. Normally underperforms SPY over long term, but short term financials are booming.

PWR - Electricity infrastructure play. Has put on a reliable 5% a month for almost 12 months straight. Only goes up, but has recently seen some pullback and consolidation.

MTZ - Communications and infrastructure play. like PWR, solid steady growth over the past 12 months.

GPI - Shortage of new cars will drive up the used car market. GPI stands to benefit from that as they own lots of dealerships throughout the US.

AZO - Similar to GPI, but more of a ""pick and shovel"" play. More used cars means more maintenance, which could benefit AZO.

269,PLCE," Some great stocks that I've been following since July 2020 that I think are just solid plays:

AGCO - Agriculture equipment manufacturing company. They're up 200% since July 2020, and have crossed into 52week high territory. they just pulled back for some consolidation, but could see another breakout. Lots of room to grow, and investing in agriculture can help bring diversification to your portfolio.

TEX - Heavy equipment machinery company. Great play if you're betting on infrastructure expansion and projects. Good company with good fundamentals.

PLCE - Children's clothing. This is going to be super hot this summer, and with wide vaccinations we're seeing lots of travel and school reopening. Kids who have been stuck at home for the past 18 months are now going to be outfitted by their parents in clothing that doesn't have holes in it. A lot of their growth may be priced in, but they're a great niche player thats been on a solid trajectory.

BGFV - Sporting goods store. More volatile, but you can see that their revenues are sky rocketing as everyone is ready to break free of the burden of lockdown. DSG is similar in this vein, but BGFV could see more growth.

COF - Financial company that primarily draws revenue through credit cards and financial instruments. Just announced a quarterly dividend. Normally underperforms SPY over long term, but short term financials are booming.

PWR - Electricity infrastructure play. Has put on a reliable 5% a month for almost 12 months straight. Only goes up, but has recently seen some pullback and consolidation.

MTZ - Communications and infrastructure play. like PWR, solid steady growth over the past 12 months.

So again no clue where you are getting your numbers from LOL or maybe you are misplacing numbers but their total revenue is 39/40Billion for 2020 giving them an EPS of 145 for last year which considering their Price of 14/15$ is a lot - their total assets is about 56B with only 25B on their liabilities side and a net income of 2.9B - they are a great buy IMO but not for any reason you said lol - why would you even look at Market Cap unless you are swing or day trading ??? Where are you getting their earnings to be 15B - looking at their technical trends they are definitely over bought and due for a pull back just from people taking profit anyway... 

>IPIX...

You need to read the earnings call and look see what they're doing. 
They're also buying back the preferreds which are yielding 10%.

AMKBY - read the last earnings call. Rates have dramatically increased last few months. I work in the shipping industry and am familiar with all that's going on. Management is estimating 15B in earnings this year. With what's going on with shipping rates, equipment and driver shortage, and port congestion I think they set the bar low. They're have 1 1B in buyback and initiated another 5B to be completed in next 2 years. 


IPIX is a tiny biotech. It's got a few good drugs in the pipeline. Brilacidin finishing up Covid trial. Should have results in August. 
If good it will fly if not it will tank. 
So either $100 or 5 cents. 
Brilacidin is one of the best drugs tested in pre-clinical so it may be a fair bet. 

EXROF seems to have a few good products in testing in multiple industries.a Raymond James has a c$9 price target.

341,CAN," **Market hours:** Those are a hold-over from non-electronic trading days. It's hard to change up the status quo. It forces everyone to trade in the same time period and not give an advantage to hedge funds located in different time zones. There's no reason this couldn't open up more, but it's been this way for its entire history up until about 2 years ago so it'll take time to change

&#x200B;

**After hours trading:** This isn't done on the same market as the ""market is open"" market. It's happening on what is called the ECN. This system matches up buyers and sellers and is independent of the market price. That's why a stock can run up or down crazy amounts after hours. But when the market opens the prices in the AH don't matter - that's why they snap to the opening price. AH price CAN affect market price, but usually the volume in the AH is so low compared to the open market that it really doesn't. This isn't to screw the retail trader, it's just the way it works.

Imagine you and a buddy buy a bunch of candy and after the grocery store closes you decide to sell the candy. You may be able to drive the price up because the supply is low and demand is high, but as soon as the store opens again the price of that candy is going to snap back to market prices

&#x200B;

**Options:** Options prices are affected by the stock prices. As stated above, after market close the actual, real price of the stock isn't moving so options prices aren't moving either. You selling your candy after the store closes isn't affecting the price of the candy in the store, so the options you bought for that store candy isn't changing price either. You can't trade options after hours because they're in the grocery store with the candy and the store is closed. That's not to screw you, it's just like asking ""Why isn't my gas mileage improving"" when your car is off. Because you're not moving.",TheIndulgery,68,/r/stocks/comments/nrg1xd/why_does_pre_market_exist_and_why_are_options_not/h0gqqk3/,0.054,0.919,0.027,-0.7519

&#x200B;

But since GME we've seen a lot more people taking AH prices seriously. Taking BB for example, it closes around $14 and by the time the market is about to open the price is now $18 but the AH market isn't allowing anyone to buy. So hundreds of thousands of people put in limit orders and instantly at the bell all of those orders kick in. Now the price may dip for a second or two but suddenly millions of dollars are being bought up in the first instant and the AH price has effectively managed to force the market price upward.

368,CD," 1st you need to understand that this is a fanatical stock. The sentiment is dominated by gamers and crypto miners and if you are either, you know how they can be total zealots. Thats the biggest warning I can give you. Right now they are high on NVDA but the knife cuts both ways and if the tide turns, price will fall below reason as well.

See CD Projekt Red to see what happens when Gamer sentiment turns. They seem to believe that CDR is dead and all future games they make will fail. The price has been shredded despite the best financial year in their history, low PE (albeit cyclical), massive dividend, and re-alignment to make twice as many games going forward... But the sentiment is apocalyptic. They may as well had help make COVID in the Wuhan lab at this point given how people are talking about them. Which is perfect if you are a buyer now but not so much if you were in prior.

So back to NVDA, that is what you are facing. Crazy investors. Not bad folks, but just nuts. Can be a good thing if you take advantage of it but can also cut the other way.

Fundamentally NVDA in a good place business wise. But its not rainbows and unicorns. For one thing, they are currently heavily influenced by crypto mining. Whether you think thats good or bad is a matter of opinion. Im of the opinion that this is not good for business because if cryto goes away, they may well lose 50% of their rev... the risk is high.

The other issue is PC sales really havent gone anywhere in a while and there is a good chance that the move to streaming gaming will eat a huge portion of the gaming market especially consoles, down the road. I would imagine they (Sony, MS, NIN) are all eager to switch to cloud based streaming if they can to eliminate the high cost of consoles and charge monthly fees (and such). So just like how we switched from hard copies to downloads the last 10 years, we may be switching again to streaming in the future. This would be horrible for video cards.

Now I am not saying all the above will happen and maybe you dont plan to hold that long anyway. But that would be my bearish argument for a long hold. In the near term, they are obviously overpriced... that is unless you think that they can maintain 50%+ growth for the next 3-4 years or so.",thejumpingsheep2,0,/r/stocks/comments/nr36nr/what_are_your_thoughts_on_nvda/h0eq1k7/,0.108,0.758,0.133,0.9103

Essentially, if these prices remain in the $1,000 price range I think it will drive more people towards consoles, but hopefully CRSR is thinking about that possible future and seeing that they are investing more money into streaming equipment/R&D I think they are at least somewhat prepared and able to weather this storm.",GeneralTroll,4,/r/stocks/comments/nqxp6i/the_weekly_dd_corsair_gaming_crsr_rise_of_the/h0dupse/,0.0,0.864,0.136,0.907

537,GDP," It’s really not even just a trade war. Trade wars are temporary and designed to inflict acute economic damage against countries with a trade imbalance.

It’s probably part of a longer-term strategy as the US looks to outperform the Chinese economy, which is slated to surpass the US in GDP within the next few years (obviously not in GDP per capita, though).

China has been massively self-investing the way that the US should for future growth, and as a result they’re running hot and very worried about projected population decline because that deflation will hit in the next decade, so if they react too sharply to deflate they may end up with a pendulum that swings too far.

Chinese companies also aren’t doing so hot in terms of accurate financial reporting, so that’s scaring investors off.

How can someone invest in foreign companies and not care about international politics? I’d also be worried about global pushback against Chinese exports if investigations into the origin of covid-19 show uncertainty about China’s official narrative. The US and Euro bloc may well end up working together against them.",notherday11,5,/r/stocks/comments/nr9bwp/rstocks_daily_discussion_options_trading_thursday/h0gh28v/,0.12,0.856,0.024,-0.9595

583,USA," The problem you have with this is the Chinese government never sanctioned these ADR's and have always stated that foreigners cant buy Chinese stock. In other words, they wouldnt be betraying anything by canceling these ADRs. The blame will fall entirely on the ones who created them, not the CCP.

I am not saying this will happen but I have a feeling we are indeed being set up for it.

1st globalization is not always a good thing. I would say that it really a wash for developed countries. Its a boom for developing countries. Its probably a bad thing for us because it raised prices for those within the country making it harder for them to buy things, most notably, real estate. I actually think that foreign investors should be 100% banned from residential real estate or anything fundamental to living in the USA like agriculture land ownership, utilities, and water ownership. Im ok with other stuff but there needs to be limits.

2nd, the idea that stocks control business is false. They do not. The underlying businesses will be perfectly fine even if all stocks collapse to $0 today. What would happen is they lose access to selling shares to raise money. But that is all. No one is going to stop buying from Alibaba because the stock is gone. No one will stop manufacturing in china because the manufacturers stock is gone.

3rd, the folks who own businesses will be at a huge advantage if stocks collapse because they can now buy their own shares at a huge discount. The rich will become much much richer with a stock market collapse just as they do here in the USA on every crash.

Last, this is one hell of a weapon to use.

Unlike the USA, China is not driven by the finance sector. They are a productivity 1st country. A collapse for us would hurt a lot of jobs in finance. We are 80% ""service"" while they are just 50%. Not all service is finance but you see the problem here. This would hurt us a lot more than it hurts them. On top of that, we are a free speech country while they can control the narrative any way they want within China.

Again I am not saying this will happen. Just that it will not result in the collapse of China's economy. Not even in the least. In fact, it might actually help their economy in the long run and the perception will not be that China lied, it will be that a few fraudsters made Caymen companies to defraud the world despite Chinese law and a bunch of fools bought into the fraud while knowing full well that they cant own Chinese companies.

For me personally, I just dont see the point to playing into something that is in the grey. There are other places to invest.",thejumpingsheep2,1,/r/stocks/comments/nqzduy/what_are_some_cheaper_stocks_that_people_are/h0hly5a/,0.173,0.722,0.105,-0.9935

The market on which options are traded is completely separate from the stock market.

The CBOE is the largest options market. It matches buyers and sellers. It's a lot like the stock markets in that market makers post open quotes at what they estimate to be the proper bid and ask prices, and other traders can take those prices or quote their own.

When an option holder wants to exercise, they tell their broker and their broker tells the OCC, which runs an algorithm to decide to whom goes the honor of being assigned. I.e., it's not likely to be the same counterparty who wrote the contract. It can be anyone short those options.

632,ICE," Happy Cake day!

Yes the US has been spending money it doesn't have for years, but it can easily be accelerated and things are in place for that to happen.   I think you are going to deep into what I said where I tried not to be all political esp where I dislike both sides for excessive waste.  Its on topic of this post though to talk about govt spending.

Socialist projects = free college, student loan forgiveness, free healthcare, free housing for poor people, appropriations, growing benefit programs like food stamps, increasing intake of non-citizens and paying for their housing etc..    These are projects the current majority party typically advertises for votes and they cost billions/trillions and once started will be hard to take away.

Crisis = every once in a while the media in the US picks up a story that fits a narrative and inflates it in a way that suddenly the government has to spend money on it.    A future example is the climate crisis - something slightly out of the ordinary will happen like an extra dry month in California and it'll be crisis all over the news, must act now spend trillions to rebuild infrastructure and get rid of ICE vehicles, green new deal etc...  Another future example will be the current majority party and media focusing on every single gun related incident and passing a gun buyback.. that would easily cost $100,000,000,000.       Another example I can see happening is starting up a new war with the media hyping some minor incident like they did with WMDs.  The media tried to do this multiple times to the previous president with North Korea, Russia and others.    There is always something the media focuses on and where the main stream media is in bed with the current majority party it would be easy to sway the public with propaganda into things that cost a ton of money.",MtnXfreeride,2,/r/stocks/comments/nrbg20/is_the_dollar_likely_to_bottom_out_soon/h0gm06p/,0.116,0.733,0.151,0.8791

They seem pretty concerned and unhappy with the 3 year rise in the Yuan. Maybe if Xi leaves for the next premier or something? 

China's dominance in the next 10 years will continue to be similar track to what it is now, supply chain and manufacturing dominance, and a high yuan would absolutely choke and drag them from their potential. After 10 years, we'll start to see them moving into AI dominance - at which point they can move the Yuan up in value and into reserve status.  There is no way they'll let the Yuan rise unless we're talking 20 years out. It just hurts more than helps them right now if their goal is to achieve global dominance. ESPECIALLY with their soft colonization of Africa over the next decade.

Get that?  2022 revenue projects are \*RISING\* at an annual rate of 47%!  In other words, if the forecast keeps rising at that rate, by the end of 21, the 2022 projection will be up another $1.4B!!!  That's FREAKIN' MASSIVE REVENUE GROWTH.

From there I sold 5 shares at $45 and another 5 at $55, securing a solid profit off the trade and now I have 8 shares to ride out the rest of this volatility. I may be able to sell at $100, I may screw up and miss out and sell on the way back down around $20, or somewhere in between. Regardless I secured a solid profit and still get to enjoy the ride.

720,NOW," By buying the equivalent I mean buying the exact opposite and it cancels out your short option. Some broker also just have a close button which does the same for you. That means you pay premium twice and also have to take the losses.

What you mention is what I call hedging but I'm sure that's the wrong word (I suck super badly at remembering how something is called). One scenario can be the one you are talking about, where you open positions close to each other for the opposite directions to minimize risk. It's not as great as it sounds, you pay premium twice and this is only effective if you have volatility given or expect volatility. In the first scenario premium will be very high. Then you have to determine a point to sell and hope that it then moves in the opposite direction. Once it moves far enough to equalize the premium you are good.

Usually you get a short dated option for the move that you expect soon to happen and a longer dated option for the reversal. 

Also, let's say I bet the price goes up and buy calls. Now it went up 10% and I want to keep my position open but market looks uncertain. NOW I buy puts equal in amount to my calls, so not right away but after it already moved. This is riskier because a part of the time wasn't covered, but if there is absolute reason to believe it goes up, then this is better to do.",oodex,1,/r/stocks/comments/nr53xs/advanced_options_questions_can_you_sell_a/h0ep2xi/,0.109,0.802,0.089,-0.4197
