3,VERY," HITID is easily the smart play here.  Money managers and institutions are moving into pot, because its quiet.  And they accumulate during quiet times.  NMGRF ran all week because its uplisting on monday.  I played it similarly.  Pennystock investors HATE reverse splits, and so it irrationally sold off, and I accumulated and im making good $$ now.

HITID is next.  Also, its market cap is VERY reasonable for a pot stock.  


I guess AMBL is set to uplist also, not sure if they reverse splitted.  But that could be a good one.",TheLastJewmurai,0,/r/pennystocks/comments/nj7jm4/most_discussed_stocks_in_pennystocks_last_week/gz752uv/,0.063,0.805,0.132,0.6822
