70,ALL," Don’t do that! Diversify!

An example:

There’s 100 penny stocks at $.01 a share 

You have $1,000 to invest

There are two scenarios:

Scenario A: 
- You invest $10 into each stock and buy 1,000 shares per stock

Scenario B:
- You invest $1,000 into one stock and buy 100,000 shares

Now, let’s assume one out of the 100 stocks grows to $100 as it did in the stock shown above

Scenario A: 
- You have a 100% chance of owning 1,000 shares worth $100 a piece equalling a total of $100,000

Scenario B:
- You have a %1 chance of owning 100,000 shares worth $100 a piece equalling a total of $10,000,000

Now, obviously $10 Million is far more enticing than $100 Thousand, but if we assume that you have a 1 in 100 chance of winning per year, by choosing scenario B, you could play this game up to 99 years or more with $0 gain. If you chose to go with scenario A, you have a 100% chance of earning $100,000 which can be used as a down payment in an investment property, placed in a good ETF for a 8% anual return, etc... and in a few years of playing with scenario A you can easily have several millions of dollars by investing correctly and taking advantage of compound interest. 

Keep in mind that investing is never certain and this is a ridiculously dumbed down example and the odds would be far closer to 100,000,000 to 1.

71,AM," Don’t do that! Diversify!

An example:

There’s 100 penny stocks at $.01 a share 

You have $1,000 to invest

There are two scenarios:

Scenario A: 
- You invest $10 into each stock and buy 1,000 shares per stock

Scenario B:
- You invest $1,000 into one stock and buy 100,000 shares

Now, let’s assume one out of the 100 stocks grows to $100 as it did in the stock shown above

Scenario A: 
- You have a 100% chance of owning 1,000 shares worth $100 a piece equalling a total of $100,000

Scenario B:
- You have a %1 chance of owning 100,000 shares worth $100 a piece equalling a total of $10,000,000

Now, obviously $10 Million is far more enticing than $100 Thousand, but if we assume that you have a 1 in 100 chance of winning per year, by choosing scenario B, you could play this game up to 99 years or more with $0 gain. If you chose to go with scenario A, you have a 100% chance of earning $100,000 which can be used as a down payment in an investment property, placed in a good ETF for a 8% anual return, etc... and in a few years of playing with scenario A you can easily have several millions of dollars by investing correctly and taking advantage of compound interest. 

Keep in mind that investing is never certain and this is a ridiculously dumbed down example and the odds would be far closer to 100,000,000 to 1.

153,ATOS," Here’s the thing,  day trading is more popular than ever this year (Bloomberg last reported a 600% increase in volume of penny stocks year over year, and I’m sure it’s even higher since last week). With that, you’ll get a lot more volatility in an already volatile category. So, you’ll have a lot of people following the whole “buy the rumor sell the news“ rule. People are selling the news on everything, no matter how good it is, it’s a clear trend. Look at every stock after they report earnings, and you‘ll see regardless of the results they often dip, at least for a little bit.

&#x200B;

BUT - stocks that dip on good news very, very often recover. Look at ATOS. They reported truly amazing results two days ago, and it’s not until TODAY that they are having their biggest run. That type of stuff happens all the time.

About the CGuard® EPS

The CGuard® Embolic Protection System is an advanced platform solution designed to deliver the flexibility of the traditional open-cell stent with advanced protection from peri-procedural and post-procedural embolic events caused by plaque prolapse through the stent strut that can lead to stroke. CGuard’s unique MicroNet® technology mitigates the prolapse and associated embolization and has shown superior clinical outcomes for patients against alternative carotid stent types, conventional and next-generation double-layer stents, as well as invasive procedures such as endarterectomy, a major surgical procedure.

486,GME," Just because I'm tired of looking at GME numbers, I felt like doing a bit of a write up.

&#x200B;

CLABSI (central line-associated blood stream infections) are a huge burden.  While they have been decreasing over the last five years, 2019 still had over 18,000 cases of CLABSI reported.

Mino-Lok is combination of minocycline and disodium EDTA. We have had both of these around for a long time.

* Minocycline is a tetracyline antibiotic.  These are the possible infections the study will cover.  Again, the study arms will cover the Standard of Care antibiotic (SOC), and then SOC + MinoLok.
   * S. Aureus incl. MSSA and MRSA
   * Vancomycin intermediate S. aureus (VISA) and VRSA (resistant) -
   * Vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE)
   * Candida
   * Pesudomonas
   * ""other gram negative organisms""
   * ""other organisms of high virulence..""
* Disodium EDTA has been studied and known to be bacteriocidal at certain concentrations (20mg/ml usually), while also effectively acting a blood anticoagulant.  Many practices have moved to using disodium EDTA to ""lock"" catheters versus heparin due to the safety profile.

If a patient presents with symptoms of infection, and they have a central venous catheter (CVC) AND positive blood cultures (meaning, their blood cultures show some kind of infection), there is usually the discussion of what to do with the central line.

Often times it will need to be removed, but it is very complex to do so.  If the line IS removed, then the patient will often require a full course of IV antibiotic treatment BEFORE another CVC can be placed.  Can't put a clean line in dirty blood or else the line just gets dirty again.  I've seen it take a week or more before a line can be reinserted.  This can delay treatment, increase costs, and - if the patient has a high-risk, difficult placement (such as one that is placed by interventional radiology) - can expose the patient to unnecessary sedatives, medications, and a ""procedure"" exposure risk.

What do I want to see?

* I am intrigued to see their results for time to catheter failure and all-cause mortality.
* I want to see their SOC antimicrobials. What effect will Mino-Lok have on something that may not have as good a response to minocycline?
* I want to see a study arm with results against E. Coli. It is a frequent blood stream infection, I'd hazard a guess more so than Candida.
* I did not see how many treatments of Mino-Lok are required and at what percentages they are successful.  Of course, cost will be a factor down the line but I imagine they would price it below what a replacement might cost and factor in a ""delay of care"" cost along with ""risk of morbidity/mortality"" as an upcharge.",holupholupohok,2,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/lci8lp/ctxr_presenting_their_phase_3_trials_update_today/gm1732e/,0.089,0.848,0.062,-0.9469

495,ATOS," Pretty much. But even more than a regular stock, you have to be ready to eat the cost. You're buying a contract that expires. You can then re-sell that contract before it expires, or you can exercise the contract to buy stock at that price.

So in OP's case right now:

Contract money - Sell current contract (that he bought for $128) and make $98 in profit.

Exercise contract - Buy 100 shares @ 4.30 (contract price), sell 100 shares @ $4.68 (market price), profit of $38.

&#x200B;

So RIGHT NOW, it would make more sense to sell the contract. However, if ATOS was suddenly trading at $6, exercising the contract would net $170 in profit.

However, if ATOS dropped below $4.30 a share, the contract is essentially worthless and the $128 that OP bought it for would be sunk; no money to recoup (and no way to just sit on it forever hoping for the stock to go back up, which you CAN do if you buy stocks outright).

525,RH," Just Google Jordan Belfort. He did a recent interview with yahoo finance stating in his opinion he thinks that Robinhood is toast. He explains that with all the pending lawsuits it's impossible to think that they won't go bankrupt and go out of business. They had to raise billions of dollars after this mess. Can you imagine how bad it will be when there is billion dollar lawsuits thrown at them. Best case scenario is that a bigger company buys them out.

If there is anyone that knows about lawsuits it's Jordan. Only time will tell though.

I was lucky to move all my money out. I'd hate to see people who have thousands I'm their account if RH goes out of business. Going to be a nightmare

The only thing I do miss is the UI.

539,RH," I’m going to stay. My view was “how the hell can this happen, Robinhood is working with citadel” to quickly realizing, buying was frozen across almost all brokerage apps (there were some exceptions). Robinhood took the blunt force to the head because they’re number one. The dude with the very very punchable face, Vlad, definitely messed up with lying about it not being liquidity and then it being about liquidity and then who else knows what. 100% but overall it affected everybody, even brokerages overseas started to freeze it. So either they all simultaneously had liquidity problems, or, somebody high up was like “hey stop this, it’s going to cause problems” and froze the market. That being said, the fact HF could still buy leads me to believe the latter. I don’t think it’s RH fault but I do think they were in the wrong for lying. That being said, I’ll stick to RH because I like the user friendly app and know how to run it and from everybody that’s switched, they all said the other ones suck to deal with.",xJett44x,1,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/lclbdh/sticking_with_robinhood/gm1gaa0/,0.144,0.784,0.073,-0.9413

584,PB," >They will issue new shares whenever they need money.

True. Shares have been diluted by nearly 180% over the last year.

And far be it from me to call Dr. Quay into question, but dude is pulling $5M+ a year in compensation - doubled from 2018-2019 and 2019-2020  - but the company is not making any money.  He holds 0.011% of the company (19th of top 20 holders), and at  sub-$5 prices, unless he has a shit ton of hidden options, idk what else other than cash.

While they don't have any debt, their cash runway is forecasted to last less than a year.  Short term assets can more than cover short and long liabilities, but they need something to crack.   PB is solid and returns beat the sector, but doubtful it will reach back to where it was before anytime soon (March 2013 highest @ $2k/share).",holupholupohok,4,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/lcp0ht/atos_awareness/gm1e2f0/,0.076,0.831,0.093,-0.3259
585,ATOS," I've said this a few times but we should also have a slight skepticism for the CEO. Seems like a smart guy, and if he's actually doing the research for their breast cancer stuff and not some other scientists, then I think ATOS has massive value beyond what we're seeing now.

My main concern, from the second I saw the apnews article, is that Quay concluded in a scientific paper (that hopefully is being peer reviewed) that COVID-19 came from a lab, with ~99% certainty. This is serious conspiracy level stuff. So there's maybe 3 possibilities:

1) It did come from a lab and he's one of the first to try and prove it and be correct (this greatly improves my outlook for anything he's involved in).

2) There's error in his methods and he's wrong (not so good).

3) That was said before this other press stuff for publicity?

I currently have 1 ATOS share for the lols, I got out of it at $2.35, way too early, but I don't like risk and I can't afford to lose much $. Regardless I'm *super* interested to see what happens here.

RH is just the prominent figure and took alllll of the blunt force right to the face. They lied about being a liquidity problem and then in another interview said it was a liquidity problem and so on and Vlad said some dumb shit, yes. 100%. But the fact that all of the small brokerage apps did it at the same time, there was definitley influence from something else. Could it have all been liquidity issues across the board? Absolutely! Vlad coming out and saying it wasn’t liquidity issues on the first pitch made it so much worse for everything.

He’s also got a very punchable face.

About the CGuard® EPS

The CGuard® Embolic Protection System is an advanced platform solution designed to deliver the flexibility of the traditional open-cell stent with advanced protection from peri-procedural and post-procedural embolic events caused by plaque prolapse through the stent strut that can lead to stroke. CGuard’s unique MicroNet® technology mitigates the prolapse and associated embolization and has shown superior clinical outcomes for patients against alternative carotid stent types, conventional and next-generation double-layer stents, as well as invasive procedures such as endarterectomy, a major surgical procedure.  InspireMD’s CGuard™ has created a new dimension in the protected treatment of carotid artery disease and has the potential to establish a new standard of care for the management of carotid artery disease and stroke prevention.",Junior767676,2,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/lca7fe/nspr_ontx_ogcn/gm19yb6/,0.006,0.933,0.062,0.9571

In fact most people misunderstood the SPAC as a ""European Pot Stock"" to stay away from (bc of the 3 merging, the named acquisition was based in Europe and had cannabis in its name- which is what now makes up the Synthetic CBD analog platform lead by Prof Mechoulam- who discovered the body's endo-cannabinoid system & potential 2021 Nobel Nominee). So when the SPAC went public, there was a complete lack of interest, resulting in the stock rights staying around the stock-equivalent price of $3.

747,EV," Tesla makes 500,000 cars a year. Contrary to popular belief they have quality control issues that should not be happing in a mass produced car. That's not impressive by any means when your revenue is tied to how many cars you can pump out monthly.

Are we to believe his unproven self driving tech fills in the valuation gap? 

Better software guys are coming in strong right now. They do not have a weak hand in this game. 

  Toyota and VW alone produce well over 100,000+ vehicles a month. Do you think they in the end will miss the EV boat? Mass production of vehicles is probably the hardest business in the world to pull off. Arguably Tesla is not pulling it off right now.. 

Paypal and Space x have nothing to do with Tesla...  On paper.   

So I guess fundamentals are kinda worthless.
