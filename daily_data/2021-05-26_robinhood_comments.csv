I stopped reading here. You're moving the mark. You think the mark is the 'current price' because you think that's a thing rather than understanding that the bid and ask are different prices and you're looking at the mark which is the midpoint between the best bid and ask prices. When you place your order at the mark, you become the best bid and the mark becomes the midpoint between your bid and the outstanding ask. The mark will always be higher than the best bid and lower than the best ask. That's how math works.",CardinalNumber,25,/r/RobinHood/comments/nliruk/am_i_huffing_paint_or_were_they_fucking_me_on/gzirdvw/,0.026,0.823,0.151,0.9699
