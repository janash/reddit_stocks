4,ETH," I don't like this at all. The only thing that is obvious in the crypto world right now is that bitcoin is fundamentally obsolete. PoS is becoming increasingly expected, ETH has passed bitcoin in transaction volume a while ago, and the real question among non-stablecoin crypto is whether the standard will be ETH or something even more modern.

...And as far as stablecoins go, Tether is now on the Solana blockchain and has cheaper transactions than most banks, debit cards, or centralized exchanges.

So the question is whether or not you think that bitcoin's size is a benefit relative to something smaller when viewed as a speculative investment. Given that bitcoin definitely can still see -80% price swings but \*is\* big enough at \~1T market cap that it's very difficult for it to 10x, I don't think that's the case either and that a big player like ARK would be better off picking some promising-as-a-currency midcap coins and promoting them.",BosonCollider,1,/r/investing/comments/oa9ft0/ark_files_to_open_bitcoin_etf_arkb/h3gpxt7/,0.057,0.87,0.073,0.39

10,JP," That’s not true. 

The first slide is a list of Regulators, Banks, institutional investors and public companies that have gotten involved with BTC in 2020. 

The second slide is a correlation matrix arguing BTC deserves strategic allocation in portfolios next to Gold, Equities, Real Estate, Bonds etc. 

The third slide shows how investors can now access Bitcoin using futures contracts and how that activity hit an all time high in 2020.

The fourth slide argues that based on the past 10 years comparing it to other asset classes it deserves an allocation of 2.5-6.5%. Low end for minimizing volatility and high end for maximizing returns.

The final slide predicts the impact on BTC’s price if the above mentioned institutions allocate 2.5-6.5% of their portfolio to BTC.

Edit: I realized I skipped a slide on growth in trading volume, but my point is that is they have a POV that is not just “BTC is the future”. Not sure how you got that from the above mentioned slides. It’s also similar to the guidance JP Morgan/Goldman Sachs has been disseminating to their clients this year: BTC is an asset class that can be a valid addition to a diversified portfolio.",mrcharlze,8,/r/investing/comments/oa9ft0/ark_files_to_open_bitcoin_etf_arkb/h3gy8hk/,0.047,0.903,0.05,0.39

So will all their competitors.  Not that it actually matters.

37,DLTR," Long on DLTR. 

Dollar Tree had a recent pull back due to negative outlook on increasing wages and freight costs. These are certainly bad things but I think per usual smart money has overreacted. They missed some key points of what Dollar Tree is evolving into, and focused on short term problems that will affect all retailers not just Dollar Tree. 

The Case for being long: 

Fresh Produce and Frozen Meat: DLTR started piloting fresh produce and frozen meat in some of their Dollar Tree Plus stores. In “Americana” or rural America, there exists what is called food deserts. Dollar Tree will now fill that void. Likewise, in lower socioeconomic urban areas food deserts also exist. Dollar Tree and Family Dollar (same company) can serve these communities. They will now also be able to accept food stamp benefits which will further provide a strong market product fit. 

The company is also piloting a combo Dollar Tree and Family Dollar stores. Which can be correctly positioned to take on Michael’s and JoAnn fabrics in the arts and crafts industry. These combo stores have seen a 20% increase in same store sales according to Dollar Tree. 

Reasons I could be wrong:

1. Freight costs keep going up and up eating at profits. 

2. Inflation also eats at profits of products they offer with lower margins.  

3. Supply chain constraints especially from China where most of their products come from. 

But overall I think the momentum here is positive. We will of course see if I am right but I bought in @ 100.38 per share. My plan is to hold for at least 2 years.

so you shouldn't have been surprised to see the option dropping in price. the theta was burning away *fast*.

i'd say the mistake was in buying in the first place without a plan for what was going to happen afterwards.

personally if i'd been holding SPCE for >1 year and thought it was going to drop from those stratospheric heights, i'd have either just sold the shares, or sold covered calls on the shares, in the mid 50s. then theta would've been on your side.",zedoary,1,/r/investing/comments/oa4gpg/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/h3he3p9/,0.08,0.883,0.037,-0.608
78,SPCE," You essentially placed a bet that the stock price would close below $46 on on 7/2. Your potential gain out of the bet is the difference between the actual stock price on 7/2 and your strike. E.g., at $44 on 7/2, you would earn $2 per option, so $200 overall  (one option contract = 100 shares). If you paid more than $200 premium for your put, you would still have a loss. Hence, you always have to know your break even for the option. If you paid $300 for your put, you actually placed a bet that the price on 7/2 is below $43 (that is your break even).

In addition you bought a very short term option. They seem cheap compared to longer term options, but that has a reason. They are very high risk for you as buyer and are very volatile (meaning they can loose 80% in a day and make 300% tomorrow - or the other way around), at least if the strike is away from the current price. 

And agree to zedoary, covered call would probably have been my choice in your situation and with your believe that the stock will drop as well. If you own 100 shares (or a multiple of 100) you can sell calls against your shares. E.g., when SPCE was at $55, you could have sold a call with say $60 strike and collect the premium. If the stock price goes down you can buy the call back for less premium and have a gain to help covering the loss from the shares. If SPCE goes above $60 until expiry, your shares will be sold for $60. So essentially, you sell future profit potential in exchange for cash (and the cash you received is your protection against a decline in the share price).

All that said: Other than maybe selling covered calls and even for those, stay away from options until you feel comfortable with them and know what you are doing.

The moves mentioned feel like those of a bull who's playing defensive because it expects a downturn/correction. How do I know? Because I also been shifting to telecoms, healthcare/utilities, sold some calls against my tech, REITs, reducing margin, and slowly building up a cash pile while toning down the buying. That doesn't mean I'm a bear. It means I'm a bull who's pessimistic, expecting a correction, and being defensive.

Those are not the type of moves a bear thinking ""I think the economy will crash very soon."" would make. Bears short, long cash/bonds, buy puts, and bet against the market. Especially if it's ""very soon"". 

>difference is between a ""bear"" and a ""doombear"" 

Doombear is the guy who screams doom. A market bear is someone who ***makes bets & moves against the market*** or bets on whatever they are bear against. Bears make money shorting things. A doombear CAN be a true bear, but it's often just all talk. They'll talk about doomish crashes of biblical proportions but still somehow hold stocks/etfs instead of buying puts, shorting, selling their positions, and stocking up cash/bonds/farmland/food/guns/3x-leveraged-bullets.

Burry was a doombear who was a real bear in the 07/08 crash because he was calling a huge crash AND bought bets against the US. Positions that were losing him money to hold until it dropped. More recently, Michael Burry been doombearing ETFs and index funds since pre-covid crash, but he's not a bear because he's hasn't been betting against them. He is a TSLA bear since he actually bought puts against it.

Those are not the type of moves a bear thinking ""I think the economy will crash very soon."" would make. Bears short, long cash/bonds, buy puts, and bet against the market. Especially if it's ""very soon"". 

>difference is between a ""bear"" and a ""doombear"" 

Doombear is the guy who screams doom. A market bear is someone who ***makes bets & moves against the market*** or bets on whatever they are bear against. Bears make money shorting things. A doombear CAN be a true bear, but it's often just all talk. They'll talk about doomish crashes of biblical proportions but still somehow hold stocks/etfs instead of buying puts, shorting, selling their positions, and stocking up cash/bonds/farmland/food/guns/3x-leveraged-bullets.

Burry was a doombear who was a real bear in the 07/08 crash because he was calling a huge crash AND bought bets against the US. Positions that were losing him money to hold until it dropped. More recently, Michael Burry been doombearing ETFs and index funds since pre-covid crash, but he's not a bear because he's hasn't been betting against them. He is a TSLA bear since he actually bought puts against it.

IMO INTC isn't good for the short term and you'd have to have a lot of faith in Gelsinger turning the ship around. Right now Intel is not undervalued but IMO fairly priced given the risks involved in investing in it. The price is right but I think OP is looking at the upside potential compared to the price and sees a deal. As someone holding the company and considering my holdings, I would say there is upside potential (esp if you hold long) but it's not ""undervalued"".

The reason why it's not ""undervalued"" is because it's losing and getting disrupted. It's a tech company in the sense that it's in the field of high tech semis, but it's NOT a tech company in the sense of growth and disrupting others. In fact it's looking like a dinosaur. TSM, CSM, Samsung, etcetc. AMD, NVDA, ARM, etcetc. All bombarding it from all sides. Cheaper & faster manufacturing, 7nm/5mn foundries built and running, 7nm/5nm designed and selling, already developing 5nm/3nm, etctec.

101,AMD, I’d argue that due to problems with their processes (14/10/7nm) Intel is in fact overvalued. For quite a while AMD has had objectively better chips (so they’re likely to lose DC share).

102,AMD," Comparing P/E of the declining market leader to those taking market share isn't very useful.

Intel already trails TSMC on the foundry side and Samsung will be shipping GAA FETs in their upcoming process nodes by 2023 which should see them also leapfrogging Intel. 

In addition to this Intel really don't seem to be buying up EUV capacity so I don't see how they can be competitive in the foundry side.

On the design side Intel are trailing on key technologies, it's clear their late adoption of chiplet designs is really hurting them as monolithic hurts their yields and ability to bin chips well. Until they catch up they'll keep bleeding market share, especially in DC.

I think Intel is quite fairly priced considering the position they are in. The chip shortage is the only thing propping up their market share because customers can't buy enough AMD products, which forces them to buy Intel.",SomewhatAmbiguous,3,/r/investing/comments/oac3ox/intel_corp_intc_is_undervalued/h3hd6ll/,0.064,0.844,0.092,0.3786

Intel will be the only one designing, manufacturing, and selling its own 7nm and 5nm chips other then TSMC and it will all be made in the US so government subsidies will be likely very generous towards Intel’s ventures",BooBeef,6,/r/investing/comments/oac3ox/intel_corp_intc_is_undervalued/h3gorlo/,0.0,0.893,0.107,0.9179

The top to bottom approach USED to be an advantage for INTC. It let intel develop chips to suit it's founderies, build founderies to suit it's chips, control quality, AND keep it's development secrets/techniques in house.

The world has changed since. It's about SPEED now and everyone is ganging up on INTC. Apple designs it's own chips and has TSM make them to install into their own hardward cutting out Intel. TSM allows NVD, AMD, and others to save on costs manufacturing in Asia, but the speed of having 7NM & 5NM already built so long as 1 leader already paid for the manufacturing of chips. So companies [that fall behind LIKE INTEL](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/12/intel-to-tap-tsmc-to-make-new-chip-using-enhanced-7-nm-process-reuters.html) can have their 7nm/5nm chips quickly manufactured at TSMs existing 5nm/7nm factories it built when it made those same chips for the leaders. That's assuming INTC finally finishes designing their 7nm (scheduled for 2023 btw). That is how far Intel has fallen. INTC doesn't have any design tech it can keep in house because it's behind. TSM will get to gleem into INTC's designs, QC policy, and industry special sauce when IT manufacture's Intel's chips.

That's before we factor in how every player is working with each other with INTC's pie was it's target. TSM, CSM, Samsung, and other manufacturers like those in Japan all having pricing power and now tech lead over INTC. Designers also have a tech design lead over INTC, eating it's local market share, and aren't slowed down by having to build their founderies (if TSM shits the bag then they'll go to Samsung/CSM/etc). Bigger players like FAAAM/BAT getting into the space in BOTH design and potentially manufacturing. Double the sector means double the threat. And the fact that Intel has the largest market share means it has the most to lose.

Thinking INTC's top to bottom chip manufacturing is an ""advantage"" would be ignorant. It HAD been and advantage and COULD in the future. But right now it's not.
