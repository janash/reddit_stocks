2,CTO, A lot has changed since the Oroplata days when this was a mining company.  Ex-Tesla Ryan Melsert arriving as CTO completely transformed the company.  ABML has 3 verticals and the two main areas of focus are li-ion battery recycling and lithium extraction.

3,PDAC," I agree with all this, there are so many tremendous options in the sector, each with their own industry space.  

Even within ""mining"" there are companies who focus on different materials, and completely different technologies to mine in a traditional sense or extract (e.g., lithium from brine, claystone, other formats).  I'm not here to fanboy, I'm sharing news and information and I encourage others to make their own investment decisions.

If it does EVFM one product right now, phexxi, will be the only product in that category forcing insurance plans to cover is 100% with no co pay. They have been trying for about a year and the CEO seems very determined to donor soon. Also their were talks of a potential celebrity endorsement for their advertising campaign. The last I think for this year would be an international licensing agreement for phexxi. Risks involved in this play include the fact they just had multiple cash offerings and still only have cash till EOY at current burn rates. They spend A LOT on advertising for phexxi.
