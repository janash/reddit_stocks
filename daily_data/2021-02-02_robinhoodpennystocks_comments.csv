200,CEO," Hmm. Well ZOM’s CEO a couple weeks ago confirmed that the company was building up Truforma inventory and that the March 30th launch was still on schedule. The week after that the company confirmed they had signed an agreement with a major veterinarian supplier/distributor. So recent signs have all been positive. I imagine as it gets closer to the launch date the stock will go higher. Especially if they announce pre-orders online. To me the low $1 range, where it’s currently at, is a good buy in. Conservatively thinking it’ll go up to $2 at least. Much more when positive product reviews and sale numbers come in.

240,ALL," This is very confusing to understand. I’ll repost a comment that I typed out earlier to OP further below that hopefully explains why your $10,000 wouldn’t cover GME. 

So you have cash. You want to buy GME still. I’ll make it easy. So you buy one share for $300. Okay for Robinhood just for you that’s no problem. They give your $300 to the DTCC and send $300 more for the new 100% insurance to cover it until it settles. But that’s just you. Now if ALL 13 million of robinhoods users want to buy one share of GME for $300 on cash with the new 100% interest that DRASTICALLY changes. Now Robinhood gives the DTCC $3.9 billion from its customers who bought in cash PLUS another additional $3.9  billion to cover the 100% insurance on GME until it settles. And that’s just on one measly share of GME. Now let’s say everyone wants to buy 10 shares of GME instead.... that’s 10x the cost Robinhood is going to have to cover now... you can see how with Robinhood only having $20billion in total how that could be a huge problem.

This is why some brokerages like TDAMERITRADE still had to halt margin trading but could allow cash still because bigger brokerages have cash in the TRILLIONS not just a measles $20billion like Robinhood. 

I hope that helps explain why we couldn’t even trade cash. And I’ll say again, Robinhood still sucks here.

Robinhood and most other brokerages have to go through the DTCC anytime a stock is bought. Even though it looks instantaneous on our end, the money still has to transfer to the DTCC and settle which takes 2 days. Let’s say you buy a $100 of stock. Normally the DTCC charges a small fee from Robinhood to hold for risk while the money transfers. Normally this is about 1-10%. So Robinhood gives them the money for the stock AND an additional $1-$10. In 2 days when the transfer clears and the money is settled the DTCC gives Robinhood their $1-$10 back. 

But because of the crazy trading and high risk from GME the DTCC comes out and says, hey all brokerages we are now going to make you give us 100% to hold while the money settles. Now Robinhood is having to fork over a TON more cash. Not only that, but many are trading on margin. So Robinhood is covering that as well. But also very few people are selling GME. This creates a potential cash flow problem. Some brokerages like TDAMERITRADE just simply shut down margin trading on GME and other stocks. They still allow cash. Because they have about $2 trillion. Fidelity has like $10 trillion. These are the heavy hitters. Robinhood on the other hand only has about $20Billion. This is about 50-100x less cash than the big brokerages.

Robinhood goes “oh shoot we don’t have cash for these high interest risk stocks” so they go raise an emergency $1Billion last Thursday to try to create a little more liquidity. But instead of coming out and saying that, they were shady about it. Probably because people would think “wait, they can’t compete with bigger and better brokerages? When things get volatile they can’t cover stocks I want to trade? Well I’ll just switch brokerages then” so Robinhood was covering their own butt as well and again it came back to bite them hard cuz now instead of people just thinking Robinhood is a smaller less prepared brokerage, they instead think they are dishonest which is much much worse. And then eventually the truth still comes out that they were less prepared and that screws them too lol

Long story short. It seems Robinhood just doesn’t have enough cash to cover crazy trading. They tried to hide that. It came back to screw them hard. And rightfully so. They should’ve been honest. People would be more forgiving. 

I hope that makes sense. All that said, I may still move brokerages because of all this.

Edit: as for what citadel did, I think what happened is that citadel knew Robinhood has cash flow problems. They probably were aware this type of thing would happen once the DTCC raised the interest rates on high risk stocks. They still were shitty and shorted the stock once the word came out about Robinhood having to shut down trading. Citadel can still go to hell imo. 

TLDR Robinhood is more just incompetent and out of their element than too shady.",procrastin8te,9,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/lai9dy/newest_email_from_robinhood_fuck_them_liars/glot2lc/,0.113,0.785,0.101,-0.6865
253,RH," \> If they were having a hard time, they would have restricted stocks across the board, not specifically the ones they have deep relation to (Citadel).

This right here proves you aren't reasonable. Why would they need to restrict the stocks that weren't blowing up? You're being intentionally illogical just to complain.

Are you being paid off by hedgefunds to say bad shit about RH to distract from what the hedgefunds are doing to screw us over? You shill!",downstairsCandy,0,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/lai9dy/newest_email_from_robinhood_fuck_them_liars/glq1c8d/,0.226,0.774,0.0,-0.9549
254,GME," You’re totally fine! It’s SUPER complicated to understand. 

So yes, normally with Robinhood or any other brokerages if you want to buy shares of most stocks the DTCC charges a small holding fee like 1-10% of the total cash. So if you buy a $10 stock and the DTCC interest is only 10% because it’s a low risk stock then Robinhood sends the DTCC your $10 plus an additional 10% or $1 to cover the minimal risk for the 2 days until the cash officially settles. But with GME we all know it’s gonna crash regardless of a giant short squeeze or not. GME is a $15 stock. So can it go to $1,000? Maybe. But at some future point it will in high likelihood be around $15. So the main question is how and when. Because of this the DTCC goes, okay a ton of people are gonna lose money on this. Instead of having the interest rate at 1-10% for GME, we are now raising it to 100%. Hey all you brokerages you have to cover 100% of all these GME trades until the cash settles. For big brokerages like fidelity who have something like $10Trillion they go “okay no problem, business as usual” for TDAMERITRADE who has less like $1trillion. They say, “okay kinda an issue but we will just drop margin trading to limit risk for now” for a tiny brokerage like Robinhood who only has $20billion or like 1 tenth of these larger brokerages they go “oh crap, we really need to slow down these buys because we simply don’t have enough cash on hand to cover the increased interest rates for GME. That’s why they did an emergency fundraiser last Thursday to raise another billion and tried to open GME back up for 1 measly share Friday. 

And to further answer your question. Yes. So if you buy 1 share of GME for $300 then Robinhood or any other brokerages currently have to give 100% interest to the DTCC while the cash settles for a couple days. Once the cash settles then the DTCC sends the $300 back to the other brokerage. 

Because even though on our end buying and selling stocks looks instantaneous. Behind the scenes it isn’t. The cash is still send back and forth and has to settle for a couple days. The DTCC was trying to minimize risk. Robinhood was also trying to minimize risk of a giant cash flow problem. But instead of coming out and explaining it clearly, they tried to hide it probably because they didn’t want to spook investors. But now they look shady AND still have a cash flow problem. If they would’ve been honest and said “hey we are really trying to help you guys out and give commission free trading and give everyone access to the market, but because GME is so crazy and we are a very small brokerage we simply don’t have the cash to cover the DTCCs new higher interest rates. We are going to try to raise some more money so you guys can keep trading. We are sorry” I bet a ton of people would understand. Still be frustrated. But understand. But they didn’t. And now it’s coming back to bite them. It made them look super sketchy instead. Likely Citadel knew of the DTCCs new higher interest rates and knew Robinhood was small. So just waited for their chance to pounce and short from the top. Citadel and Melvin still suck. Along with any other shorts who over shirt. Robinhood is just incompetent but because of that they look sketchy too. Hope that helps explain :) it’s a giant mess. This whole GME thing has exposed problems all over. The main thing that worries me is how many regular people are going to lose tons of money. Because they will.

263,ALL," Yeah I’ll try to explain: this is more of a guess but would make a lot of sense to me. RobInhood has to cover margin as well (which is money people don’t even have in Robinhood) which means Robinhood on GME and high market trading days is spending more money than all their customers have deposited into Robinhood combined. They can cover all stocks on any given trading day. And most on high volatility days. But when the DTCC raised the interest rates on those stocks last week I think Robinhood looked at ALL their customers and did some math and said “if all these people try to buy these stocks and we have to cover 100% interest until the cash settles. Then we simply don’t have enough money on our end to do it because we have covered so many people on margin. 

Just my thought. That’s why they raised an extra billion and then tried to open it back up pathetically on Friday by allowing one share buys lolz. Again I assume if robinhood had $1trillion then you would’ve been able to at least buy all the GME you wanted as long as you had cash. 

I’m not defending Robinhood here. They still suck. Just for different reasons than we all initially thought.

Edit again lol: 
Even though I hate how Robinhood handled this whole ordeal. I still would prefer they stay around. Simply because of this. They were the ones who offered commission free trading. Before then we were all having to pay fees like $6 for EVERY buy and sell order. No matter how big or small. If Robinhood goes out of business, then I assume other brokerages would go “hey let’s add commissions back” so we do need at least one competitor who is going to compete and give free commissions so all the others have to match that. It’s so nice trading commission free on TDAMERITRADE. That is an unintended consequence I don’t think I’ve seen anyone consider yet.

Edit #2: I thought of an easier way to explain. So you have cash. You want to buy GME still. So you buy one share for $300. Okay for Robinhood just for you that’s no problem. They give your $300 to the DTCC and send $300 more for the new 100% insurance to cover it until it settles. But that’s just you. Now if ALL 13 million of robinhoods users want to buy one share of GME for $300 on cash that DRASTICALLY changes. Now Robinhood gives the DTCC $3.9 billion from its customers PLUS another additional $3.9  billion to cover the insurance on GME until it settles. That’s just on one measly share of GME. Let’s say everyone wants to buy 10 shares instead.... that’s 10x the cost Robinhood is going to have to cover now... you can see how with Robinhood only having $20billion in total how that could be a huge problem.",procrastin8te,3,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/lai9dy/newest_email_from_robinhood_fuck_them_liars/gloxasv/,0.049,0.823,0.127,0.991

322,ALL," I am new to Reddit but not trading. The GME fiasco peaked my curiosity so here I am.

I am NOT a financial advisor but please let me share some hard earned lessons. As my user name says...We All Win When I Win. Why? Because doing DD will set you free and make you money!

When you see folks on these Reddits screaming Ticker Symbol! Ticker Symbol! Ticker Symbol! They are doing one of two things...trying to Pump a stock to Dump it, which is illegal, and what has been going on lately with GME, AMC, BB, NAKD, etc. Or...they are so under water (losing money) with a Shit stock they're just praying they can convince enough people to buy it to get them out of their bags (losers).

The key to either day trading or long holding is RESEARCH. YES reading about a company not following the herd screaming random ticker symbols. Do your DD and pick a REAL company with a REAL product or service. If you find Company X with 1 employee in Shit Stain City in even worse State and the companies page info only says ""looking to invest in future money making ventures for a huge return on capital"" RUN. Far and Fast!

If you are interested in doing sound research then learn how the market works. One good place to start is Investopedia. If you're interested in Penny Stocks, which is why we're all here, then check out the stock screener here: [https://www.otcmarkets.com/research/stock-screener](https://www.otcmarkets.com/research/stock-screener)

A perfect example is INKW (Green Works). They are a specialty water and beverage company and their 1 year low was .0011. They are now at .0337. So a 1K investment less than a year ago would be worth $30636 today. Not too bad off a 1K investment. It just so happens this company just got picked up by Amazon with premiere placement and free shipping to 300+ million Prime members. This company is also clawing for Nasdaq listing which will make it explode and also make it very attractive for a buyout from a Coke, Pepsi, or other large Beverage player.

My point is THOSE are the types of companies you want to find. Not the ones people are screaming on these sub-Reddits and not providing ANY viable reason why you should invest your hard earned money in it.

THIS sub-Reddit is where we ALL should be able to share REAL info about VIABLE stocks and ALL make money. Let the yellers and Pumpers go to another Sub-Reddit down the ""street"".

For the record I am not being paid by Investopedia, INKW, Reddit or anyone else. I just like to see people make money. After all, WE All Win When I win.

It just so happens this company just got picked up by Amazon with premiere placement and free shipping to 300+ million Prime members. This company is also clawing for Nasdaq listing which will make it explode and also make it very attractive for a buyout from a Coke, Pepsi, or other large Beverage player.

My point is THOSE are the types of companies you want to find. Not the ones people are screaming on these sub-Reddits and not providing ANY viable reason why you should invest your hard earned money in it.

THIS sub-Reddit is where we ALL should be able to share REAL info about VIABLE stocks and ALL make money. Let the yellers and Pumpers go to another Sub-Reddit down the ""street"".

For the record I am not being paid by Investopedia, INKW, Reddit or anyone else. I just like to see people make money. After all, WE All Win When I win.

Good luck and happy hunting Warriors!!!

329,REAL," I am new to Reddit but not trading. The GME fiasco peaked my curiosity so here I am.

I am NOT a financial advisor but please let me share some hard earned lessons. As my user name says...We All Win When I Win. Why? Because doing DD will set you free and make you money!

When you see folks on these Reddits screaming Ticker Symbol! Ticker Symbol! Ticker Symbol! They are doing one of two things...trying to Pump a stock to Dump it, which is illegal, and what has been going on lately with GME, AMC, BB, NAKD, etc. Or...they are so under water (losing money) with a Shit stock they're just praying they can convince enough people to buy it to get them out of their bags (losers).

The key to either day trading or long holding is RESEARCH. YES reading about a company not following the herd screaming random ticker symbols. Do your DD and pick a REAL company with a REAL product or service. If you find Company X with 1 employee in Shit Stain City in even worse State and the companies page info only says ""looking to invest in future money making ventures for a huge return on capital"" RUN. Far and Fast!

If you are interested in doing sound research then learn how the market works. One good place to start is Investopedia. If you're interested in Penny Stocks, which is why we're all here, then check out the stock screener here: [https://www.otcmarkets.com/research/stock-screener](https://www.otcmarkets.com/research/stock-screener)

I am new to Reddit but not trading. The GME fiasco peaked my curiosity so here I am.

I am NOT a financial advisor but please let me share some hard earned lessons. As my user name says...We All Win When I Win. Why? Because doing DD will set you free and make you money!

When you see folks on these Reddits screaming Ticker Symbol! Ticker Symbol! Ticker Symbol! They are doing one of two things...trying to Pump a stock to Dump it, which is illegal, and what has been going on lately with GME, AMC, BB, NAKD, etc. Or...they are so under water (losing money) with a Shit stock they're just praying they can convince enough people to buy it to get them out of their bags (losers).

The key to either day trading or long holding is RESEARCH. YES reading about a company not following the herd screaming random ticker symbols. Do your DD and pick a REAL company with a REAL product or service. If you find Company X with 1 employee in Shit Stain City in even worse State and the companies page info only says ""looking to invest in future money making ventures for a huge return on capital"" RUN. Far and Fast!

If you are interested in doing sound research then learn how the market works. One good place to start is Investopedia. If you're interested in Penny Stocks, which is why we're all here, then check out the stock screener here: [https://www.otcmarkets.com/research/stock-screener](https://www.otcmarkets.com/research/stock-screener)

A perfect example is INKW (Green Works). They are a specialty water and beverage company and their 1 year low was .0011. They are now at .0337. So a 1K investment less than a year ago would be worth $30636 today. Not too bad off a 1K investment. It just so happens this company just got picked up by Amazon with premiere placement and free shipping to 300+ million Prime members. This company is also clawing for Nasdaq listing which will make it explode and also make it very attractive for a buyout from a Coke, Pepsi, or other large Beverage player.

NO I am NOT trying to Pump INKW! I don't care if you buy it or not. My point is...THOSE are the types of companies you want to find. Not the ones people are screaming on these sub-Reddits and not providing ANY viable reason why you should invest your hard earned money in it.

THIS sub-Reddit is where we ALL should be able to share REAL info about VIABLE stocks and ALL make money. Let the yellers and Pumpers go to another Sub-Reddit down the ""street"".

For the record I am not being paid by Investopedia, INKW, Reddit or anyone else. I just like to see people make money. After all, WE All Win When I win.

619,RSI," RSI stands for relative strength index. It is an indicator for how overbought or oversold a particular share price or currency is. 
The standard parameters are 70/30. So usually when the price hits one of the levels it can be confirmation to open a position that you was looking at. So if it hits 70 then you can say that its overbought and there may be a light or big drop. You can change these parameters so they are more extreme to single out the better trades. My personal favourite is 85/15. If you set your RSI levels to this then when you see it hit these levels you know that it is in the extremitys and the liklihood of a reversal is much higher. You just have to be patient.

The divergent part of this image is what happens when the RSI graph and the price graph do not correlate with each other. For example here the price actually reached a higher high on the price chart but the buying power on the RSI was showing something different. Its showing a lower high which is a bearish divergent and this is usually quite a strong indicator.

I don't do ""DD"" fundamentals on penny stocks as they are 99% Bullshit and I don't have the time for that (I used to be a promoter. Go ahead. Ask me a question.). I trade swings. No longs. Ever!

I'm in on GEN @ $.67 and LEDS $4.10 (only in $100 on both as of today. So no, I'm not an asshole. Do plan on adding more at anytime though)

GEN and LEDS came up on a screener I use frequently. Avg Vol, Performance, Cap, etc.
