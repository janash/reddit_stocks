4,PLTR," PLTR is pretty fucking risky. It's doubled then subsequently halved in three months. I don't know much about margin, but I think PLTR is considered one of the riskiest stocks in terms of short term, as someone whose biggest position is a long position in PLTR.",iloveyoumiri,50,/r/RobinHood/comments/m8vwuh/as_long_as_my_stock_value_stays_above_the_margin/grju1jr/,0.102,0.853,0.045,-0.4012

6,KO," Using leverage adds a degree of risk that is markedly higher than not using it. Interest rates are currently low but will go up some day, which will affect your margin cost. Plan accordingly.

Also, using $PLTR as an example of a ‚Äúsafe‚Äù stock is really naive. The company IPO‚Äôd less than a year ago and was down almost 30% in a week this week. There is no good way to currently value this company other than hopes, dreams and memes.


A safe stock is some boring shit like T or KO. PLTR is a huge risk, especially on margin.",themaxvoltage,7,/r/RobinHood/comments/m8vwuh/as_long_as_my_stock_value_stays_above_the_margin/grjz09y/,0.172,0.632,0.196,0.7202

8,PLTR," Lol at PLTR being low risk. I actually also have a lot of PLTR on margin but I sell CCs against it and it more than pays for the interest. I had 100 people on reddit tell me to do this before I grew a sack and youtubed how to do it. Search selling Covered Calls right now if you don't know what I'm saying. Don't wait.

Happy trading!",Trumbulhockeyguy,10,/r/RobinHood/comments/m8vwuh/as_long_as_my_stock_value_stays_above_the_margin/grjuepv/,0.104,0.814,0.083,-0.1253
9,PLTR," ‚ÄúLow risk stocks like PLTR‚Äù lol.  

Your margin balances are a function of two regulatory numbers primarily, your SMA balance (initial 50%) and your Excess (typically 30% for stable securities). I don‚Äôt know RH‚Äôs maintenance requirements for PLTR but my guess is that it isn‚Äôt 30% and if it is their risk management team probably aren‚Äôt big brains. 

Margin trading can be useful in some scenarios but it might be worth considering that aggressive use of margin means that not only can you lose all of your money if your trade goes poorly, it means your trade going poorly can take you to a point where you now have negative equity.",utilitarianfox,6,/r/RobinHood/comments/m8vwuh/as_long_as_my_stock_value_stays_above_the_margin/grjx7z6/,0.119,0.795,0.086,-0.7311

11,RH," Same here, using margin for Tesla and Apple, with some cash just in case. I‚Äôm also using good accounts so the payments goes instantly. It‚Äôs safe and internet rate is low. Only downside is that they don‚Äôt let you buy volatile stocks on margin like gme, amc. So this is short term and i will start using margin on my fidelity acc.

12,PLTR," I use margin daily, so no lectures from me on telling you don't do it (assuming can afford the surprise margin calls).... But I will echo the others chuckling about you calling PLTR low risk, and then add in the morsel of knowledge that the maintenance level you see today doesn't mean it'll be the same tomorrow.

My maint req level for various positions goes from 25% to 100% to 65% (etc) every other week. And the stuff I fill my side RH account with literally has a price floor that means it wont stay below that bottom price for too long (SPACs).

Unless you're utilizing only a small portion of your account with margin, then you're going to find yourself with a margin call at some point. If you have the cash on standby to dig yourself out, go at it, but certainly don't expect your margin levels today to ever stay the same later on, especially on PLTR lol.",CrateMayne,2,/r/RobinHood/comments/m8vwuh/as_long_as_my_stock_value_stays_above_the_margin/grka4mz/,0.031,0.905,0.064,0.7516

14,GME," Uhhhh....probably not the time to be using margin. Would you like to be forced to sell your stock at a huge loss? That‚Äôs what happened to my options buddy, he lost 70k. The market has gone super volatile since January and with this GME weirdness building in the horizon, I stopped using margin totally.

15,PLTR," I‚Äôm gonna be real with you man, PLTR as others have pointed out is speculative. This is wayyy more risky than an etf or blue chip, even with them if you‚Äôre running with margin and the market takes a steep turn downwards or whatever company you invested in has bad news and the price drops, you will be margin called. When I first got started with the stock market I also wondered why people didn‚Äôt do this, but there‚Äôs a reason.

16,PLTR," Whilst OP needs to get their head around the fact the PLTR is high risk (wow, that was blas√©), I think there‚Äôs a general misconception about the risks attributed to margin. 

Managing margin is an important part of trading and investing and to run scared of it is to leave money on the table.",throwaway8619425,6,/r/RobinHood/comments/m8vwuh/as_long_as_my_stock_value_stays_above_the_margin/grkirtk/,0.145,0.823,0.032,-0.6705
17,CC," I'm sure you know this, but for anyone reading this who doesn't...

Selling covered calls against a long stock, especially on margin, IS NOT insurance. 

Selling CC is an income strategy. You cannot take in a net credit and have protection, at the same time, on the same trade.

You would, at a minimum, need to buy puts to have any insurance against loss.",Cypher1388,5,/r/RobinHood/comments/m8vwuh/as_long_as_my_stock_value_stays_above_the_margin/grkes95/,0.045,0.879,0.077,0.2732
