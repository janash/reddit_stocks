57,AT," Agree. They have everything wrapped into a gameplan. One good thing about precious metals. You can‚Äôt just print more of it. Silver has been getting harder to mine for the last 30 years. They‚Äôve gotten to the point it‚Äôs a by product of other mining. Hard to get + cost of mining increasing + 5% loss of product annually + increased need/demand for all tech + no scientific viable replacement = increase price. Should be a good play until someone makes something that is as conducive, stable, right melting temp, durable, non-corroding as silver. I think we have AT LEAST 20 years of upward momentum.

64,GME," I was worried for the future of this sub last week but I actually think it will be OK soon enough.

This GME thing is a fad and will blow over within a week or two. 

Its an unpopular opinion, but I don't see a lot of compelling reasons for the GME price to skyrocket. If anything, we know that skittish newcomers have had an entire weekend to think about that rash decision to buy their 5 shares of GME at 330 a pop and I'm guessing there's a lot of buyers remorse, especially since the stock didn't moon on Friday.

Any price jump, especially over $400, is gonna send a huge percentage of the newbies selling to recoup their investment, make a few ""tendies"", and say they were a part of history.

Then the stock will drop. Panic selling ensues. Users will find some way to blame RH. Then, as quickly as they appeared, they'll be gone.

65,RH," I was worried for the future of this sub last week but I actually think it will be OK soon enough.

This GME thing is a fad and will blow over within a week or two. 

Its an unpopular opinion, but I don't see a lot of compelling reasons for the GME price to skyrocket. If anything, we know that skittish newcomers have had an entire weekend to think about that rash decision to buy their 5 shares of GME at 330 a pop and I'm guessing there's a lot of buyers remorse, especially since the stock didn't moon on Friday.

So say, for example, you've got a bunch of shares of a $0.75 stock that just won't go anywhere. If you said it's PT was $10 people would think you're full of it and ignore you. If you said it was $1.00 that wouldn't seem like a sufficient reward for the risk. So people will probably make up a number like $3-$4.

101,GME," I mean, for as much as I hate it, it makes a lot of sense. Could you imagine if a broker went tits up and the clearing house didn't have enough collateral to make you whole? It's happened before and been a major problem in the past. Here is a better explanation that I read earlier today:

>	The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation settles most listed securities transactions in America; in 2011, it did $1.7 quadrillion [1]. You've never heard of it unless you're a professional trader, but it's actually quite fascinating to read up on. Trading looks instantaneous. But settlement takes a few days. In between are a series of credit agreements. From your broker to you. From the clearinghouse to the brokers. DTCC is the clearinghouse. Robinhood is the broker.  

>	There are rules and contracts between DTCC and its members, including Robinhood [2]. Those contracts ensure that when you buy shares through your broker from a Robinhood customer, if Robinhood falls down two days later, there is collateral sufficient to make you whole. Those collateral requirements change in reference to, amongst other things, the volatility of the security. (If a broker falls down, the clearinghouse liquidates their collateral and makes their counterparty whole. More volatility means more chance the collateral will be insufficient.)

>	In this case, collateral requirements on GME went up. Because of its volatility. So while before Robinhood had to pony up collateral for a few shares of GME for every hundred it traded, it now had to, at close of business, pony up one hundred shares' worth of collateral for every hundred it traded. That creates a cash crunch. One that exacerbates itself with every additional trade in the security. If Robinhood fails to satisfy those collateral calls, they go out of business overnight. Into receivership. Done.

>	Most brokers have policies for these situations. Higher brokerage fees for securities on a schedule. Not making shares and cash from trades available until the trade settles, sort of like what banks do for large cheques. But I don't know if Robinhood is able to do that quickly. So instead they pulled the plug.

gaming is similar. the presumption that game stop is out dated is based completely on a misunderstanding of what gaming is to Millenials and younger.

they keep now accusing us of cynically investing in game stop for the lulz but in truth we really do like the stock.

when they put out the article about shorting game stop I got scared since I didn't want it to go away like radio shack did. I wish game stop was still around and if game stop all went away it'd suck.

AMC is second to gme because movies theaters aren't something I'd miss so much now that we can get better at home and through streaming.

if game stop didn't exist we'd have to go to Walmart or target which is lame and not at all the same.

I like shopping for collectibles and random gamer stuff.

I like it so much I literally go to Ross soley on the off chance they might have geek art. I scored 2 framed Nintendo pictures from Ross. I don't care about Ross except I know they sometimes have stuff that game stop has.
