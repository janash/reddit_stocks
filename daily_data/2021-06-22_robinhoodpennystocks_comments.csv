23,GTE," * GTE has oil fields in Colombia.  The recent protests are no longer affecting production.
* With people taking COVID vaccines, economic activity related to travel and transportation could pick up, increasing the demand for oil.

* They have a high amount of debt and have worked out a deal to pay it off.
* One of the major stockholders is a hedge fund - GMT Capital.  They shorted on $TSLA a while back and lost big time.  GMT sold a lot of GTE to keep their investors happy, keeping the price down.  Now they own less than 10% and don't have to report each sale.

35,ATH," Isn't that because Torchlight has already planned to wrap up operations in lieu for selling the facility? That's selling office furniture on eBay revenue...

iirc, TRCH is wrapping up to fold into META, so the real play is whether to go long on META. Would you pay TRCH's ATH for META? META is going for 11.50, so TRCH is being priced on par with it. In fact, META trading got halted for also pumping up, up from 8cad last week. Entry points are anywhere from 5-8, imo. The dividend is worth 5, from a value perspective. I suggest being greedy and buying the TRCH dip before ex-date.

Its going to get dumped hardcore once the ex-date kicks in anyway, as dividend stocks are wont to do, so if you want META you gotta buy that TRCH dip, if I understand the merger process correctly.
