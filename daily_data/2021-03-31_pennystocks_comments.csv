Please make sure you check your brokers ***Foreign Transaction Fee*** before buying if you're in the US. 

IT'S ADDITIONAL TO THE OTC FEE that is normally charged. And it only shows on your account a day or two after the trade. 

For TD Ameritrade it's $15 and I can confirm it appears about a day later. [Here's](https://www.tdameritrade.com/pricing/brokerage-fees.page) where it's listed. 

Just want everyone to be sure they know it costs much more than a normal OTC purchase, some brokers it's $50 (Fidelity for example).

# The Latest Update -- why it matters to the Merlin #1

üì∑

It has been a silent concern of mine as to what IF a discovery of commercial volumes of oil is made. How would it get to market? To justify a pipeline, what volumes would be needed and how many development wells would have to be drilled to fill the pipelines minimum daily barrels of oil, 10K, 20K, 30K or more? This will take a considerable amount of time and of course $$$$. The only outlet from the North Slope area is the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System and it is far to the east. But, there has to be other pipelines from other fields connecting to it .... lots to consider on this topic. But it is the major factor for consideration - IF the Merlin #1 is a discovery, it will sit silently until development and pipeline connection.

**The latest update addresses ""The final condition related to the acquisition of the Umiat Oil Field (‚ÄúUmiat‚Äù) is now complete....**

This is unrelated to the current well being drilled because it is other 88 Energy business as usual. BUT, because Umiat is/was/will be a producing field, it has a pipeline to market. The Merlin #1 is located to the North a relatively short distance - so market out of discovery oil would be accelerated. **This to me ""changes everything""** should the Merlin #1 be a discovery.

Some key take outs from the article:

**The Team**

* President and CEO is Bryan Slusarchuk, ran K92 Mining + Fosterville which both saw huge growth (Fosterville 0.4$ to 5.00$ in 3 months)
* K92 CEO John Lewins‚Äîthe man responsible for creating nearly $2 BILLION in market cap there‚Äîis on the board here.
* Management and employees own whopping 35% of the shares outstanding. I always want teams that have real skin-in-the-game. That checks another important box for me.
* The Biggest Name in the silver market‚ÄîEric Sprott‚Äîinvested is always a big validation. Sprott was a ground floor investor in Slusarchuk‚Äôs Fosterville South too‚Äîwhich soared out of the gate.

**The Assets**

* Five distinct vein systems including:

1. Panuco‚Äîwith a historical inferred resource of over 19 million ounces silver equivalent and is open along strike and at depth
2. El Cristo‚Äî2.5 km strike length and up to 600 m width
3. Muleros‚Äî3 km ++ strike length

* The company is surrounded by giant silver mines. The Fresnillo Silver Mine and the Pe√±asquito Polymetallic Mine are two of the biggest in the world. After 500 years the Zacatecas Mining District still accounts for 21 percent of Mexico‚Äôs gold mining production and 53% of silver.
* The veteran geologist here (‚ÄúDr. NO‚Äù) is Chris Wilson. Wilson told me that since nobody in the last 20 years has bothered to do any metallurgy on this ground, there is great potential to increase the recovery factor.

Solar is still nowhere near efficient or effective enough, not many if any rivers we could go Hydro on without disrupting a literal shitload of the environment, and Wind Farms as well prove inefficient both in production and price for the power output they produce.

Combine this with uranium mines not putting out a whole lot of production which, eventually, will push prices up.

84,DD," Mark Bolster is also listed as the CEO of STHC on [otcmarkets.com](https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/STHC/profile) which makes the likelihood of a reverse merger that much stronger, all the dots are connecting.  I am reasonably confident that the reverse merger will take place (well, as confident as I can be with an OTC stock), however I am also cautious as to how much of Ameca and Schatzi will be rolled into the new company which will make a difference on my target price.

Schatzi has this to say on their website:

[https://www.schatziexploration.com/ameca-group](https://www.schatziexploration.com/ameca-group)

This makes me think that they will roll all their mining, exploration and production into this new entity, but what do I know.

Here is some good DD on what a reasonable price target would be if this actually goes through.  Of course, this could be a crap analysis, but I tend to agree with their outlook.  

[http://www.thedailyserge.com/2021/01/sthc-future-share-price-estimate.html](http://www.thedailyserge.com/2021/01/sthc-future-share-price-estimate.html)

I have been quietly accumulating for a while now and it is one of the few picks that I am confident enough about to encourage others to get into. 

Oh, one final thought.  For me, this is also about the management than anything else.  It seems that every time there is a pump story that is pushed around they will immediately set the record straight through a press release or Tweet.  This is not only responsible, but to me it shows sound management.  Maybe there is more to it than that, such as keeping the price down so employees and insiders can load up, or, maybe they just want to keep expectations real.  Regardless, I like that in an OTC, it gives me a tingle of confidence.  

I don't want to sound too confident because I am enjoying grabbing some affordable prices now and it feels like it is being overlooked by many that are looking for mining plays.  If this dips to the .05-.06 area again I will do more than quietly accumulate.  

I get it, I am just a dude slapping a keyboard giving their opinion but if their graphite find is even close to what has been reported, this will be a solid play.",billyruebin,3,/r/pennystocks/comments/mh56cy/mining_stocks_thread_this_is_what_im_bullish_on/gsxyvzy/,0.022,0.819,0.159,0.9939
85,NI," Well, that is tricky to answer and I wouldn't be be best to answer.  What I do know is that last August they posted this:  

[https://www.newsfilecorp.com/release/61556/Southcorp-Capital-Inc.-STHC-Provides-Shareholder-Update-and-Announces-Change-of-Control](https://www.newsfilecorp.com/release/61556/Southcorp-Capital-Inc.-STHC-Provides-Shareholder-Update-and-Announces-Change-of-Control)

Basically outlining their intention to get OTC current and complete the takeover.  They also clarified in January that much of this was dependent on the completion of the  NI 43-101 which would outline the extent of their graphite find in  Sri Lanka.  From my understanding this report was delayed due to covid travel restrictions which have since been lifted.  

[https://31f856b6-de57-4066-9e5f-3268e24b9557.filesusr.com/ugd/1416ce\_70e598828b194cbe9777c2eb01593e09.pdf](https://31f856b6-de57-4066-9e5f-3268e24b9557.filesusr.com/ugd/1416ce_70e598828b194cbe9777c2eb01593e09.pdf)

There have been reports that the find was indeed extensive, and of high grade, but I can't conclusively confirm any of these, so who knows if this is accurate, could just be knowledgeable speculation or rumors spread by those that hoping for a temporary price spike. 

Personally, I would prefer it not to happen until the OTC market begins to recover so it can take a run with the volume that it would deserve.  But, and here is where I speculate, I don't know the current financial situation with Ameca since it is private.  They might need this to raise capital to take advantage of their find, which is understandable, especially if the claim is as extensive as the rumors suggest.  

I was expecting (hoping) it to be official next month (April) but I also don't know how long of a delay they encountered due to the covid Restrictions so at this point, who knows.

134,TD," Perhaps a noobish question but here goes: So I bought 100 shares of NMGRF in Feb for 1.85/share. Today I got an email from TD that they canceled a pending sell order I had on them, this prompted me to call TD and find out why it was canceled to then learn that there was a 1 to 10 split and ticker change. The new ticker shows a price of 12.95/share.

I'm further confused because the TD rep told me I bought 10 shares in Feb when it was definitely 100. He also said that because it's still updating he isn't sure about the share price change. I didn't get as much clarity as I would have liked. If it really was split 1 to 10 do I now have 1000 shares? Also confused on the disparity in price are my shares still worth 1.85 or did they go up to the 12.95? In my positions list it does not show a ticker just a number where the ticker should be and my initial share price still as well as the amount of shares which has always been 100 since purchased in Feb.

Basically they have found oil but are still doing tests to work out the quantity and quality and whether it can be extracted. This guy says that so far it all looks very positive. 

Also there's a bunch of other DD in there about the area that they are drilling, it's basically surrounded by oil. 

The other thing to factor is potential share price value, that's a lot harder to assess as it depends on the results of the tests. But conservative estimate say around 7c a share, and they go up to 50c a share and some crazy people evenn say it could go over $1 if there is a buyout.

171,IMO," IMO, enter now before next week's news. FYI, wireline results should come out this weekend. Remember, markets are closed Friday. 

For me to give a true exit, that is really a hard question to answer truthfully especially for me.

We are going to see this go way up and pretty fast. I'm already at 100% gain. When it starts hitting .3 to .5, I'm going to maybe stroke out. I only have ~80k shares. 40k is a lot of money for me right now. I'd love to say I'm all in to over 1.00 but not sure I could handle.the ups and downs we are going to see. To say you're not going to panic is going to be an understatement, like buck fever!!! 

I do think with everything they are doing now with the new catalyst that just came out made me feel better with trying to hold past 1.00.

I'd like to be able to buy the dips and continue to increase my position if possible.

May not ever be a bad time to enter though. Definitely the sooner the better.",Ok-Sign-8349,3,/r/pennystocks/comments/mh06p9/daily_plays_march_31_2021/gsw7773/,0.018,0.773,0.209,0.9893

174,NYC," Well, if you can't trust a screenshot of an email, what can you trust?

Sarcasm aside, I'm actually really curious about your screenshot/email.

* First, he calls the person John, but they sign off as J. Not a huge thing - their email probably refers to them by their real name.
* Second, why is his footer/contact info placed *after* the message? It should automatically be place before the ""On Tue, Mar 30, 2021."" But, hey, maybe he copied/pasted it down there for... whatever reason.
* Third, how was the email two hours ago (5:55 + 2hrs would be 7:55-8:54), but the screenshot clock shows 10:43? I don't really have an answer, but not super relevant.

ACTUAL DD:

* Googling the second telephone number (212.256.1086) brings up NYC Nightlife Tours (assuming in NYC) AND Henry Torrence which, when pursued, is a men's clothing store in New Orleans. Swapping to Bing, it brings up olearyenergy and Sepalco. It takes a little more digging before you can actually find DarkPulse. Why'd he carry over his phone number from two previous businesses (the latter two belonged to him, it seems), if they were established and (more importantly) successful?
* Their website boasts [some impressive people](https://www.darkpulse.com/leaders) \- man, that last guy worked for the Pentagon and another one helped put electronics on space shuttles! But then if you go to their [demo](https://www.darkpulse.com/demo) page and click on the image at the bottom to look at the demonstration... some dude in his house puts a clamp on a PVC pipe and then stares at his computer for six minutes. You can see houses out the window. With such an impressive line-up of professionals that held highly paid positions, surely they would have the capital to do this in a more professional setting, at least where we don't see soccer moms driving by?

Like your comment said, beware of risk.

EDIT: I originally wrote the bits about the email thinking you'd sent it, and then I saw the comment where you said you got it from Stocktwits, so I changed the wording to direct the source to someone else.",TheSilencedScream,26,/r/pennystocks/comments/mh2nkt/dpls_joe_biddens_infrastructure_bill_play/gswfgmg/,0.04,0.88,0.08,0.9488

227,NINE," On top of what's already been stated by u/TheLaser40, the address given on ADSV's website is the Harvey Building - which is a collection of businesses. Each business has a suite number, but strangely (not strangely), ADSV does not list a suite number on their website.

But, hey! Yahoo Financials to the rescue - it seems ADSV's suite is [1015 and it's phone number is 561-570-4301](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ADSV/profile)\- cool, right?

As Billy Mays would say, however, ""BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE."" Googling the address directly (224 Datura Street STE 1015 West Palm Beach, for those who would like to), the third thing Google (and the first thing Bing) brings up: **Amerixon claims that address**.

But, hey, mistakes happen - let's take a look at the phone number given.

Googling it brings up another rabbit hole. Does it belong to ADSV? Does it belong to Saveene Fractional Yachts? Does it belong to South Beach Spirits?

WELL FEAR NOT - I called to find out! After cycling through three call-forwarding transfers (you can tell because the rings pause, there's some static, then it begins ringing again) you hit an answering machine with a creepily robotic female voice that thanks you for calling, says no one is currently available, to leave a message and.. wait, who did I just call? It doesn't tell you. It doesn't mention any business - it's entirely generic.

There's less red flags on an Olympic-level ski slope.

EDIT:

Actually, I got more, because this is fascinating.

Following your SEC report that you linked, I googled the Registrant's telephone number.  In addition to ADSV, it brings up Tiger Reef (a failed business), Blue Water Global Group (a failed business), and Flitways Technology - but hey, at least that last one is still in business. Looking into it, it's a travel company (nothing to do with ADSV's hardware/software) and it's located in... wait, what? Los Angeles? But what about West Palm Beach?

Well, we get a name, at least. Miro Zecevic. Who's that? Well, according to [MarketScreener](https://www.marketscreener.com/business-leaders/Miro-Zecevic-0GH23L-E/biography/), he's the CEO/President/Chairman of NINE businesses, within the past year - two of them, according to Google, are already dead.

Then I Googled the name at the end (the man that's resigning and giving Zecevic ADSV). His name is  Daniel Sobolewski. Interestingly enough, the name is immediately tied to [everything in the MarketScreener link above](https://www.corporationwiki.com/Florida/Apopka/daniel-j-sobolewski/100327416.aspx).
