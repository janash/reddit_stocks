0,DD," Rule 4...I've actually made more money on sub-penny stocks than I have with penny stocks and regular stocks that are more expensive. Even if the companies were growing...there's just no match. Now, I'm not bashing if you really want to invest in any regular stock. To me, volume means more than share price. Tens of millions of shares times whatever growth amount of a good penny or sub-penny stock is always going to be more than thousands or tens of thousands of whatever larger share price stock. It's the volume that matters. Even though it is a tiny increment, with that many shares if you pick a good stock, you can't lose if you don't hold it for too long. If it goes down, you didn't pick a good company and didn't do enough DD. Have I lost money? Yep, I'm a fairly new trader. But in my posts, you'll see that just the other day I made $2,700 in one day on one sub-penny stock and $2,800 the next day that I held that same stock. I pulled out that morning when I saw prices dropping and the company deleted their twitter. I scammed the scammers who were trying to scam me and I made over $5K in TWO days doing so. Will every stock be like that? Nope. But even if I made just $500 flipping a stock every couple of days, that's darned good money being made on not that much of an investment.

You could invest $1,000,000 into Tesla (TSLA) right now. At $811.66 a pop, that would buy you 1,232 shares. Now let's go insane and just for the scenario and to make it even remotely fair, let's assume that TSLA is going to work some magic in the future and go to $1,500 per share. That would make you $848,000 in profit, but you needed the $1 million to start off even investing in it and it would likely take years if it ever even hits that amount.

Now I'll do my own scenario: I only get $50,000 to invest initially. I pick a sub-penny stock, do Due Diligence and find one that has decent volume and is poised for growth with good product/services potential. I buy in at .0010. That gives me 50,000,000 shares. It does well and doesn't even touch a penny, but jumps to .0080. I've made $400,000 very quickly. If you do your DD every single night at the end of the day, check company financials, news, catalysts, volume traded, total increase over the 1 Day, 5 Day, 10 Day and 1 Month, check multiple boards for comments from other users in case somebody saw some kind of news or catalyst that you missed somewhere...then you will do well and could easily make that amount within the same month if you trade properly. Not impossible, it is just that most of the people here don't know what they're doing and just guess for every single thing that they invest into.

Nah, I'll take my sub-penny stocks. More potential to make money in them than the biggest companies that you can think of anywhere in the world, I don't care how many products or services they sell. Doesn't compare to starting out all over again with a new company.",singingstrings38,296,/r/pennystocks/comments/li2wa5/these_are_my_rules_maybe_it_will_inspire_you/gn0vejq/,0.027,0.875,0.098,0.9826

Stocks prices should be evaluated based on the newest information you have on the underlying company. The future performance of the stock is all that matters.

WTF does it matter if you’ve made money up to this point? Stop-losses and locking in gains are traps for low IQ investors and have no basis in reality whatsoever.

On 2 Feb I sold it for $270. At its peak a little while later it was worth about $900. It's come down since then, but lowest ask is still $455 today.

Did I sell too early? Yeah, you could say I did, but it's too easy to look at it that way in hindsight. Here's the thing: You CAN NOT predict, with 100% accuracy, what the market is going to do. 

Actual, realized gains are **far more** important than **potential** gains, or what you **could** have had, if you had just held out a little longer. If you get into that mentality of just holding out a *little more*, just a *little bit more*, you're going to end up holding the bag far more often than not.

Make your trades, get your profits, and gtfo. Not every trade is going to be a winner. Not every winner is going to be 1,000%, 100%, or hell, even 10%. Realize those gains and stop worrying about ""potential.""

There are so many stocks out there. I saw a post recently talking about how they look at the moving average of the last 150 days to jump the curve on stocks. 

Just from a simple number perspective, you go to a stock screener, input that, and you can see SO many stocks where it's trending upwards, and analysts say it's a buy (DO YOUR DD HERE OF COURSE) obviously, it's volatile, it's a coin flip, so on, not a financial advisor, yada.. but it's important to just keep pace, enjoy the ride, enjoy the green, if you find a company you believe in, hold it like the LP it's supposed to be, don't get phased, but never get attached to anything, green is green, no one can ever complain about PROFIT, that's what these stocks are all about.

So what if you missed out on this pump? Or that pump? Or you got in a little late on this pump and took a couple dollars loss? Learn from it. Enjoy the quantity. Whether it be 100 trades or 10 trades that get you to where you want to be, the important thing is that you get there.

102,LKCO," hello muta. i havent looked into LKCO or TNXP and don't know how much potential they have. i can only tell you about SNGX from two perspectives:

Investor

If you wanna go longterm, consider that they are having a conference soon, where they will present their products and advancements. This could go both ways, so stay alerted whatever happens. Then their products have to go through the approval phases. If that happens, the stock will definitely see 10$ I believe, but if not, it might just go sideways for a longer period and dip when there is bad news. 

Daytrader

I said this alot but: we broke a resistance and just confirmed the $2.05 dollar mark - which is really good if you compare it to other breakouts from other pennystocks. If you're not familiar with breakouts, just google ""rectangle trading pattern breakout"" or just ""breakout pattern"". So we might have Daytraders and Swingtraders on SNGX side that want to go bullish here. Given the volume stays high enough and that all of a sudden everyone decides to sell because they want a quick buck.

161,BC," HITIF - Incredible overall business and definately not a P&D. Healthy stock movement with consolidation and storing support. Management is tried and tested and knows wtf it's doing. Organic expansion plans that aren't debt fueled. Good cash on hand Vs. Short term hand so company can stay solvent. Mktcap Vs. Rev ratio still low so undervalued. Quarterly rev growth rate is superb and sustainable. Large scale operational experience puts them ahead of most competitors, especially American ones.

NMGRF - Graphite is basically going to be the next oil once EV cars replace traditional autos (yes, this will eventually happen). Nouveau just got a permit for the largest graphite mine in North America. It's an established and reputable company with years of experience in this. They're also going balls deep on this new line, building the finest infrastructure. Also note, for non Canadians, Quebec companies typically receive enourmous government support (cough bombardier cough) so even if shit hits the fan you know the Premier is gonna be tossing them piles of cash. Invest in this company and you're investing in the cell structure of the future. 

SAENF/SOLR.V - Another Canuck company. Solar play. Recently closed an oversubscribed offering round which I believe is the primary reason for the current small drop and consolidation. Recently signed a contract to build a 56 MW, $60M dollar solar farm in Illinois. Company has excellent management that is focusing on sustainable expansion. Strong relationships with BC hydro already in Canada (they were previously supplying wind energy across the interior). Solar is hot this year and I expect these guys to ride the hype in addition to their excellent fundamentals. 

SIRC - Still chasing this company. I just love the simplicity and logic of their business model. Roofing + solar installation + EV charging installations. Mgmt is superb and has made an intelligent acquistion recently that will double their geographic coverage for a range of services. The companies fundamentals are rock solid and it's one of the few solvent solar companies out there. 

BWEN - I have no idea why more people aren't talking about this company. Just from a fundamental standpoint, it is extremely undervalued. Mkt cap is about half of revenue, quarterly growth rates are great, company doesn't have much debt, and high % held by insiders and institutions. They sell engineering sorts, services, and assemblies to a range of verticals, including renewables (hydrogen, solar, wind producers). Holding a long position in this, it's a no brainer for me. 

IQST - Another stock that isn't getting the attention it deserves. Apart from being in hot hot industries (fintech, IoT, and 5g telecom), the companies fundamentals are superb. Stock price movement is healthy af and it was one of the few green stocks yesterday. Management is decent and they have big expansion plans plus a hyperactive business development unit. Also BIG upcoming catalyst: It was announced just yesterday that IQST has signed a LOI with a fortune 500 chemical company to supply IOT services.

Also note, for non Canadians, Quebec companies typically receive enourmous government support (cough bombardier cough) so even if shit hits the fan you know the Premier is gonna be tossing them piles of cash. Invest in this company and you're investing in the cell structure of the future. 

SAENF/SOLR.V - Another Canuck company. Solar play. Recently closed an oversubscribed offering round which I believe is the primary reason for the current small drop and consolidation. Recently signed a contract to build a 56 MW, $60M dollar solar farm in Illinois. Company has excellent management that is focusing on sustainable expansion. Strong relationships with BC hydro already in Canada (they were previously supplying wind energy across the interior). Solar is hot this year and I expect these guys to ride the hype in addition to their excellent fundamentals. 

SIRC - Still chasing this company. I just love the simplicity and logic of their business model. Roofing + solar installation + EV charging installations. Mgmt is superb and has made an intelligent acquistion recently that will double their geographic coverage for a range of services. The companies fundamentals are rock solid and it's one of the few solvent solar companies out there. 

BWEN - I have no idea why more people aren't talking about this company. Just from a fundamental standpoint, it is extremely undervalued. Mkt cap is about half of revenue, quarterly growth rates are great, company doesn't have much debt, and high % held by insiders and institutions. They sell engineering sorts, services, and assemblies to a range of verticals, including renewables (hydrogen, solar, wind producers). Holding a long position in this, it's a no brainer for me. 

IQST - Another stock that isn't getting the attention it deserves. Apart from being in hot hot industries (fintech, IoT, and 5g telecom), the companies fundamentals are superb. Stock price movement is healthy af and it was one of the few green stocks yesterday. Management is decent and they have big expansion plans plus a hyperactive business development unit. Also BIG upcoming catalyst: It was announced just yesterday that IQST has signed a LOI with a fortune 500 chemical company to supply IOT services.

163,BWEN," HITIF - Incredible overall business and definately not a P&D. Healthy stock movement with consolidation and storing support. Management is tried and tested and knows wtf it's doing. Organic expansion plans that aren't debt fueled. Good cash on hand Vs. Short term hand so company can stay solvent. Mktcap Vs. Rev ratio still low so undervalued. Quarterly rev growth rate is superb and sustainable. Large scale operational experience puts them ahead of most competitors, especially American ones.

202,AI," I don't know.  I know it's a long shot but I'm 30k shares deep in GRSO. They make the technology and AI to not only support the cannabis industry, but most areas of agriculture. Technology for measuring crop health, growth patterns, and adjust settings based on environmental factors (this could be huge with a green energy push).  Like I said, they aren't just focused on the cannabis industry. 

Yes, they were slightly affected by the cannabis ""pump and dump"" but I picked up another 3k shares.  

It's not really a YOLO since I'm only talking a few hundred dollars. Been watching it stay fairly stable over the last week though, with some dips based on the cannabis bubble. 

Long story short, I'm thinking about picking up another 50k shares. Canadian or not, if the US legalizes, or even changes the scheduling, technology doesn't have the same barriers that cannabis growers would have transitioning from Canada to US markets. Technology is as global as it gets. 

TL;DR - I like Grow Solutions Holdings. Bit of a gamble but one based on solid logic. Also, pretty cheap to get right now.  Please poke holes in this for me!

I think 5$ by May/June with a NASDAQ listing and 10$ by EOY are absolutely possible, depending on how quickly they can acquire customers.

Then I'm the late afternoon it went up 25%, which I expect it to do but at open, so I missed out on that.

Is it just to take small gains and be happy? It's not the worst idea, but everyone has different strategies.

351,BE," I'm new to penny stocks, not stocks in general, but thought I would add a few things I've noticed just watching for trends and things. Not enough karma for own post, but this is fairly related. I don't have exact data to back it up, more just looking at the charts. Some things to keep in mind for new traders:

1. Do NOT get caught up in the pre-market, first open hype. Everything seems to always open fairly high with a quick, quick, quick downfall.
2. Look at the market depth if available before open. Some things might show trades pre-market around sale of .07, but the depth is really about 0.5. It will open then around .07 when the real going rate is \~.05.
3. BE PATIENT! If you're seeing posts with good DD, other people did too. People are probably going to pump and dump, so wait. If it rockets up don't think you ""missed out"". Watch the trend lines and it will probably fall.
4. Look for DD that's a few days old then look at the stock chart. If you're doing this to actually invest, wait for the hype train to be over. If you see a post today, take the next 2 days or so to do your own DD.
5. Check each day's trend for the past week, 2 weeks, whatever. If you constantly see a jump at open, followed by decline, then steady off by mid-afternoon - buy in the mid-afternoon.
6. Lastly, don't get glued to the sell price, make a mental end goal. If you throw $100 at 2 stocks, A worth $0.001 and B worth $0.5, figure out your end profit you want. To get $10 profit, A would need to jump to $0.0011 and B to $0.55. Don't think ""Oh A is only going to go up $.0001 which isn't much!"" That actually is a lot for what it's currently valued at.

I always tell my family I'm a good gambler and they're confused by that. All I do is get specific numbers in mind and then don't change them. If I'm up, I put that initial money aside and say to myself ""no touch"". If I keep going up, I say ""I want to make at least X money"" and take that out. If I'm down, I was willing to lost Y amount anyway, so there's nothing to worry about. Yeah it would be great to hit 500 home runs, but really you can get 1,000 singles and still score 500 runs, maybe more.

I read through the DD and then made the mistake of reading all of the glowing comments saying how the user that posted the DD is always so thorough and accurate.  I bought on the glowing reviews of the user more than anything which was a huge mistake.  Upon doing more research, a lot was left out of the DD and a lot was misrepresented.  The user didn't mention the class action lawsuit about misleading shareholders.  The user acted like FDA approval was a sure thing short-term (when approval was denied on their last application and just resubmitted).  My biggest red flag should have been the mention of using the product for at home covid vaccines, which would be impossible due to the high risk of anaphylaxis.

Will the merger increase the price? Yes of course. But the initial hype has dwindled and the price will continue to fall until it happens. The CEO is once again dangling the carrot, but I think it’s best to take your profits and continue to keep an eye on CBBT as a future swing play.

401,DD," Wouldn't mind some feedback on this tactic I've been using this week:

To help curb FOMO and impulse/emotional buying, particularly with anything that's projected or hyped to make a move within the next few days, I do my DD after market, so I can't buy (or sell) anything. Window shopping, basically. But if I do like what I see, I set a limit buy for the next day. If it goes through, great, I then set a stop limit at either the price I bought or for or a little lower, so I can't lose much if it starts to plummet. If no sale at all, then I walk away because I figure that I missed the timing for it to make a profit. 

It has so far kept me from losing money. I've done this with new positions I'm entering and ones I'm already in but unsure if they will go higher.

I don't do this with my long holds, because I don't expect them to do more than trade +/- a few percent and I am confident in them anyway. This is for the more volatile penny stock market, not boring boomer stocks or ETFs.

# Robotic Assistance Devices Indicates that Momentum for Products Accelerates - Receives Multiple Orders

HENDERSON, Nev.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Artificial Intelligence Technology Solutions, Inc. ( [AITX](https://qr.fidelity.com/embeddedquotes/redirect/research?symbol=AITX) ), (OTCPK:AITX), today announced that its wholly-owned subsidiary Robotic Assistance Devices (RAD) is experiencing an acceleration of activity and demand across all product offerings.

In late January, through a press release, RAD announced new orders for their ROSA and AVA Autonomous Remote Services solutions. Today the company announces additional new orders and new channel partners.

""It was only a few weeks ago that I commented that 2021 was off to a great start for RAD. I’d like to reaffirm that and say that February is on course to be remarkable for the company,” said Steve Reinharz, Founder and President of RAD. “These are big steps in our goal of becoming a ubiquitous part of every facility services program.”

Two new authorized dealers have been announced, NexGen Security Solutions in Oakville, Ontario, Canada and Servexo Protective Services, headquartered in Gardena, California. These boutique dealers join the largest security companies in the world as RAD dealers. Furthermore RAD has signed up an additional four independent sales consultants.

Since signing with RAD, NexGen Security Solutions has ordered a total of five RAD devices, consisting of two ROSAs, one Wally and two AVA units. According to the company, the AVA units will be deployed at a logistics end-user in the greater Toronto area, while the ROSAs will take up positions at an auto dealership and a residential community.

HENDERSON, Nev.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Artificial Intelligence Technology Solutions, Inc. ( [AITX](https://qr.fidelity.com/embeddedquotes/redirect/research?symbol=AITX) ), (OTCPK:AITX), today announced that its wholly-owned subsidiary Robotic Assistance Devices (RAD) is experiencing an acceleration of activity and demand across all product offerings.

In late January, through a press release, RAD announced new orders for their ROSA and AVA Autonomous Remote Services solutions. Today the company announces additional new orders and new channel partners.

""It was only a few weeks ago that I commented that 2021 was off to a great start for RAD. I’d like to reaffirm that and say that February is on course to be remarkable for the company,” said Steve Reinharz, Founder and President of RAD. “These are big steps in our goal of becoming a ubiquitous part of every facility services program.”

Two new authorized dealers have been announced, NexGen Security Solutions in Oakville, Ontario, Canada and Servexo Protective Services, headquartered in Gardena, California. These boutique dealers join the largest security companies in the world as RAD dealers. Furthermore RAD has signed up an additional four independent sales consultants.

Since signing with RAD, NexGen Security Solutions has ordered a total of five RAD devices, consisting of two ROSAs, one Wally and two AVA units. According to the company, the AVA units will be deployed at a logistics end-user in the greater Toronto area, while the ROSAs will take up positions at an auto dealership and a residential community.

[https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/02/08/2171549/0/en/Auxly-Announces-Closing-of-20-Million-Bought-Deal-Public-Offering-Including-Full-Exercise-of-the-Over-Allotment-Option.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/02/08/2171549/0/en/Auxly-Announces-Closing-of-20-Million-Bought-Deal-Public-Offering-Including-Full-Exercise-of-the-Over-Allotment-Option.html)

They call themself ""Global Leader in Secure and efficient Cannabis products"" and apparently they make a quite good job here

* Auxly had a 14% share of the whole 2.0 Market in 2020
* That means they're #1 for Cannabis 2.0 products in 2020
* It was one of the first LPs to market with any 2.0 product with an intial shipment made to 7 (some sources say 9) provinces.
* Launched multiple new brands throughout the year, Back Forty, Foray Hard Maple, Dosecann Capusles and a few more.
* The joint venture ""Sunens Farms Inc"" received the standard cultivation license for 1st phase of their greenhouse project
* ..and some more reasons

The company is currently NOT profitable but on a really good way, there's no bad news about management or any other bigger issues.

With everything else related to Cannabis thats going on right now, Biden, Democrats and legalization this looks like a pretty good long term investment to me. Don't expect any quick jumps tho.  


Any other opinions on this? Anything wrong in my thoughts about em? Anything i miss here?

To be honest, it was an accidental find, I was actually looking for GRWG, and fat fingered or something. Anyway, I have a Penny Stock dream like everyone else here I am sure, so I bought it at bought a couple hundred bucks at $0.0054. When everything crashing yesterday, I sold off my initial investment plus a little profit at $0.013, but the stock kept rising and today it's at $0.0200 (up over 250%). 

Hitting a Penny Stocks has always been a dream, but I have never achieved it before. They always fizzle out over night for me. Now, it's all profit left, but at the same time it's over $500 and the conservation angel is screaming sell, but the gambler on the other shoulder is screaming to stick in there.

481,NAKD," Yall. I have a wash sale rule question. I'm having difficulty pairing up my new average and SOFI invest support hasn't gotten back to me yet.

I purchased various shares of NAKD over the last few months.  
Purchase Price, Number of Shares, total cost of purchase

0.69 83 57.27

0.64 100 64

0.68 275 187

0.74 150 111

0.72 100 72

0.82 200 164

2.68 34 91.12

942 746.39

From my calculations, I have an average purchase price of .79.

I sold all of these shares on February 2nd at the bottom of the market on that date (I know, bad move) at .86 cents a share for a total of $811.63. A gain of $65.24.

I decided to jump back in at 1.52 (65 shares, 98.77 total capital back in) on February 10th.

But, curiously, my average is now sitting at 2.47. Is this because there was a loss on the 34 shares that I purchase at 2.68?

I'm just having a hard time with the math to get to that 2.47 average. Anyone have any insight? What is the formula used to reach that 2.47 average ?

It caused their stocks to drop for that week and then the week after it had returned back to what it was and rallied even more. These guys were the ones who also did the offering for Ocugen. I'm not saying it will be the same as OCGN, they paid a premium for it. But, these people have always bought great up and comers at prices the companies gladly took. Wainright isn't going to sell these shares for a measly 20% or 50% gain. They're going to hold until this reaches 10$ a year from now or whenever they 1000%. This is what they do to buy cheaper.

537,ATOS," First, thank you for a very thorough medical analysis. I have also been a bit skeptical to their approach with announcements about unpublished data. There are 2 points where I'd like to counterargue the marketability of their products.  


1) Regarding their COVID-19 nasal spray. If they somehow can allude to a prophylactic effect of the nasal spray and the FDA authorizes its use, I could see people using it as a prophylactic before attending large public gatherings. As we've seen, some people will do whatever they can to avoid wearing a mask.  


2) If endoxifen ends up showing fewer side-effects than tamoxifen, then the market is huge. In my country, pre-menopausal breast cancer patients receive tamoxifen as first-line anti-hormonal therapy for a 5-year follow-up period.

546,ISR," I posted this as a comment on a different post on this subreddit, but I guess I will copy it here as well.

Yeah, I am most definitely not going to talk you out of this, as Denison is a great investment even still at these prices if you are looking to hold for up to 5 years. Here is why:

1. They have the potential to have the number 1 asset in the world. If they can make the ISR mining method for their deposit work, which judging from the quality of their team and recent studies would be feasible, their all in sustained costs ($8,90) and extraordinarily high grades (19.1%) will see them generate an incredible amount of free cash flow at pretty much any spot price.

2. They have the backing from some of the most wealthy people in the business. The Lundin family has a very successful record in the mining business and I believe it will not be blemished by Denison.

3. They are co-owners (22.5% stake) in the state of the art Mclean Lake Mill, which processes ore from the eastern Athabasca Basin. This stake gives them a lot of leverage, since building and permitting a new mill can take several years.

4. They have big stakes in companies like Goviex Uranium and Skyharbour, which essentially gives them another way to get a significant amount of capital should they choose to sell these stakes later in the bull market. Those have of course already increased in value substantially these past few weeks and should look to go much further in this bull market.

5. The cash flow as you already eluded to, is not that significant, but it is definitely helpful. Their fees for management of UPC and care and maintenance on idled mines generates come cash flow.

With Denison you of course buy into a great company, but you also buy into the potential. As we all know, potential is an important factor in any valuation, although it can be relatively hard to quantify. Should Denison get into production within this bull cycle with anywhere close the numbers they mentioned for Phoenix, which I think is plausible for the reasons stated earlier, they will be an absolutely incredible investment and I think the best preforming junior in the sector from this point onwards, barring some nano caps that can of course always outperform by getting a massive discovery.",3STmotivation,3,/r/pennystocks/comments/lhz3t6/my_first_ddish_on_dnnmy_write_up_is_mediocre_but/gn2gqne/,0.004,0.82,0.176,0.9976

Good morning,

I’m a former army surgeon.   Nowadays it’s emergency, critical care and toxicology.  Surgery and emergency are separate departments and never shall they cross here where I work.

The stock looks only accessible from the Paris & Berlin exchanges.  No exposure to the broader market.

Their products look great!  But are designed for spinal repair, stabilization, straightening, etc...  it’s a distinctly niche market, where they have a high end product.  They are trying to turn around, because they are good products... but will always have limited volume, and will compete against the larger supply companies...  it’s easier to sell VWs than it is to sell Maseratis, even though we know which we would prefer.

I wish them luck, I wish I had some of their products in years gone by.  But also in the west (and they have a USA supply web page too) it is a niche market, supply companies, insurance & price agreements, etc...

But hey, you do you unless you get too sick or injured, in which case I do you.  Cheers and cheerios!",duTemplar,36,/r/pennystocks/comments/liao7s/spineway_a_true_og_pennystock/gn22161/,0.085,0.768,0.147,0.9251

I can't find all the links but the CEO is a bit of a weasel. I know all penny stocks are risky but some are notorious. Trade carefully.

I usually buy/sell 4-5 stocks daily. 

But the general advice when a stock hits 100% is to sell 50% of shares to recoup your investment and leave the other 50% invested in the stock. Stocks that hit 100% before or after you purchase tend to keep going up so not so strange that they kept going up in price. 

I began 3 months ago and have 20 stocks in my FREE MONEY club.  Those are the stocks where I recouped investment and guess what? Most of them have kept growing like before.

They have Vayu, impossible aerospace, sheet metal, quality circuits.   They are going after something else to add I bet.  Something that makes the full end to end production of VTOL or possibly delivery drones.  

I’m seriously wondering if they are positioning to become allied with Amazon and automated delivery or positioning for a full buyout from Amazon.  If Amazon did a buyout I can’t even imagine what the share prices would be.  I think we will see 10$ price targets real soon.

675,ETH," I've been accumulating HIVE Blockchain Technologies $HVBTF (HIVE in Canada and HBF in Germany) since 2018. They have been profitable for some time, before ETH and Bitcoin took off this year. 

They have slowly been acquiring other miners and constantly investing in more hardware and space. They've got very cheap electricity contracts in Quebec, Canada and in the EU. 

Their bread and butter was mostly from ETH but they've expanded considerably into the BTC market. For the last while they've been accumulating the coins and stand to show a blow-out quarter early March.

Despite having a negative balance sheet due to start up costs, this stock still ran up to a penny from the .006 level about a week ago.

I don't agree with Cannabis comparison because cannabis is one genus of plant and mostly recreational whereas psychedelics contain 1000's of different compounds for incredibly diverse neurological disorders and possible capabilities of neurogenesis in stroke and brain damage victims. 

Psychedelics were il-legalized on pure politics and show incredibly safe and effective use in clinical settings when compared with many other current mental health solutions such as, Amphetamines, SSRI's, Benzo's, Xanax, etc. Many Psychedelics have efficacy when CURING addiction through psychedelic assisted therapy!

CTRM hires subcontractors thats why they have one official employee, the CEO Petros Panagiotidis.

With revenue cost being their only expense and no debt they're focusing on adding more vessels to their fleet which ultimately means theyre strategically planning to expand their business.

CTRM was given a 180 day extension until June if I recall correctly; or stay above the Nasdaq minimum price of $1.00 compliance for 10 business days.

Pennystocks can be a way to multiply your money but you can also lose it all. You should only put a small percentage of your portfolio on these cheap stocks .

Otcmarkets.com you can see pennystocks that are being sold ,  up to date news by ticker + screener. Some stocks have warnings. 

Unbiastock.com shows you stocks that are trading last hour or 6-12-24.

Finviz.com is a stock screener with many filters but only non-OTC .

My stock portfolio is a free app to monitor your portfolio .

TD Ameritrade lets you buy almost any stock.  RH and Webull don't allow OTC and most pennystocks are OTC. Fidelity also good but occasionally don't offer a stock. 

I trade 4-5 stocks daily but that is cuz I'm on my phone most of the day monitoring my 64 stock portfolio and seeing what others recommend or what is selling .

The general advice for pennystocks is to trade not invest . Occasionally you find a winner that you keep and might add to your holds. You make more money with several 20% short trades that add up over time vs chasing winners and losing money in the process. 

We all make the mistake of getting in late, or selling too early . 

I don't do what some do like deeply research a company Sec filings , balance sheet etc. 

I go to Yahoo Finance free app and click View All. Check 50/200 MA + Float: ideally under 100M or much smaller.  Ideally the numbers at the bottom like earnings growth,  operating income,  EBITDA should be positive but rarely the case with pennystocks or companies that are growing. 

Billions of shares in a pennystock is a warning sign of a pump and dump, so is a price graph that has straight lines up, down and horizontal instead of the standard gradual curve .

Before a purchase I check Yahoo Finance conversations. You can see how much interest by number of new conversations.  Also good info from posters that know about the company.  Volume too is important.  Should be much higher than usual.

Someone pointed out that companies that price rises 100% in last year or months will probably keep going . This is very true in pennystocks. 

But these sites + Reddit are full of pumpers and dumpers.  So read through the lines.

Finally when a stock seems a winner by the point it crosses 100% for you many recoup investment.  I wait until 220-240% so I only have to sell 30% of stocks not 50%.

815,DCF," Thanks for this.  I totally agree. 

I read the investor presentation (dated Jan 2021) und found that revenue growth is great - it more than doubled year on year. Gross profit more than doubled year on year. I interpret this to be a sustainable growth story by the numbers. This should help to improve the assets to liabilities.

I put their numbers into a DCF model for fast growing business and found that with most reasonable parametrisations I end up above 1 USD for a HITIF share. I know that this heavily depends on the growth story and it is not easy to estimate a growth story over the next 10 years, but I think by using >400 mio. USD annual revenues for 2031 my parameters are not too aggressive (this is about 20% annual growth and way below the growth recently observed).

So that's only fundamentals, of course one needs to consider brand strategy, regulatory risk (legalization, COVID) and market sentiment as you wrote,  however this all seems positve to me, so it supports the case in my opiniom",Porsche981Fan,2,/r/pennystocks/comments/lhy3xt/not_just_another_hiti_hitif_post_serious_dd_incl/gn2bhob/,0.041,0.77,0.189,0.9682
816,DCF," Interesting re DCF - with such businesses unless you built it out on a store by store basis, I really feel that the assumptions become such a key driver of the value that they become a little more meaningless. 

All for a good DCF underpinned by a solid and robust, detailed 3-statement model, but when it’s too high level it’s difficult to derive value from it. 

What assumptions did you make re working capital, capex and financing? A lot of complication on treating the dilution from convertibles etc that I just feel it becomes a function of the assumptions and basically you steer it to where you want. 

With a multiples based approach, it’s more clear cut, more simplistic and relies on less assumptions which impact the output.

Hoping to be back in the green with PULM, and have an ALPP spike with a NASDAQ uplist, in the next 4-9 trading sessions.

ZOM is likely a hold for the next 10 weeks.

HITIF, BLOZF, GTE Long holds, not bothered my red for the next few months. But if profit comes early then cool!

SPRWF is potential Long, but I'm hoping to play short to free up capitol.

837,CBD," Sorry for not writing more, I was tired as shit. 
Sylios generated 0 dollars in revenue in 2019 (their latest filing, which is probably why GTLL) is in the picture. 
Wayne had holdings (through Sylios is AMDAQ and GCAN, and essentially the only income Sylios has had was either issuing notes, or selling off positions of GCAN and AMDAQ. 

Oh yeah, Wayne used to be president of GCAN too until July 2019 when it was sold to Green C, who has most recently sold CBD patches, and a Bob Ross themed eyeshadow at party city. 

AMDAQ looks like another non-company that purchases another company and launders money (Wayne is president too) but since it’s not a registered stock ticker there’s no financials posted to see the greasey-ness. 

Oh did I mention, as of their latest filings, GTLL and Sylios both only have 1 employee?",adamschw,2,/r/pennystocks/comments/li4mge/gtll_is_probably_garbage/gn253ch/,0.058,0.906,0.036,-0.4835

847,IMO," There isn't really any new news that should drive interest.  

If you do a reddit search of NOVC, there's a recent record of posts trying to pump a stock that's been the way it is for years without change or reason to expect change.  

The recent movement in price is pretty easily explained by these posts drumming up interest from redditors hoping to buy a lottery ticket, IMO.

If anything does happen here it's going to be pure momentum / bubble.",a_bit_condescending,2,/r/pennystocks/comments/libx8d/novation_companies_inc_novc_healthcare_staffing/gn2copn/,0.0,0.831,0.169,0.9246
