4,DD," my weekend research begins:
$CYLC DD So Far
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-
SHARE STRUCTURE & PPS HISTORY:
- 82M Shares, 1.5M Float

- Pink Current

- Traded at $25, and $2 Dollars recently/ Currently trading at  .0889(x). Has previously moved up dollars in just a couple weeks

MARKET:
- Looking to become a household name in Cannabis Cultivation (Growing Cannabis) and Hydroponics with the upcoming release of the ‚ÄúKipos‚Äù under Edens Ecosystems 

- Hydroponics is a $1.7B Industry per 2020.

- An estimated 1/3rd of America's marijuana is being grown inside according to motherjones.com.

- One in 3 households are now growing food, this the highest overall participation and spending levels that have been seen in a decade according to the company. Millennials represent a big chunk of this segment, moving from 8 million growers in 2008 to 13 million in 2013. 

-The 2018 National Gardening Survey also found that 15% of U.S. households would grow marijuana at home if it was legal - which has now been decriminalized in 46 States and fully legalized in 16 States. We could see this number increase with a fully Democrat Congress and White House.

COMPANY: 
- History of proven products (Grow Box 5k) in Hydroponics.

- Endorsed previously by GreenCoast Hydroponics - The #1 Retailer of Hydroponic Supplies in the West Coast

12,SP," O.K.  So a public offering UP TO that number of new shares.

So if they end up with <20 MILLION total shares outstanding then folks will do well if they buy in at current $1.85 or so to maintain current market cap (37million market cap/ $1.85 SP= 20 MILLION shares). So if the OS is basically goes up more then 3.3x then buying at current reduced price is still a loser (current OS of 6 million or so).

Big bet even at current SP.",10xwannabe,2,/r/pennystocks/comments/nmkut6/condolences_to_anyone_that_was_already_all_in_on/gzpkmf2/,0.038,0.831,0.131,0.7506
13,ABIO," The announcement was just last night; stock crashed below $2 pretty quickly. There are a lot of angles to this.  Book value is a big one, since (in theory) it doesn't make sense to trade below book value. But tell that to ABIO - they've traded at something like 30% below book in the last while. Then there's the the notion of whatever the offering is priced at, that's what the company thinks its shares are worth. The bigger the offering relative to the outstanding shares, the more this seems to apply. But don't forget about the warrants - those have (undefined) value. Plus the company is paying 5% in costs to the underwriters. So they're not really valuing the company at $2.25/share, it's probably a little under $2/share.

All of this is assuming the market is rational and not manipulated. Some people will sell at basically any price to cut ties with a company that drops a brutal offering me this. Some will jump in blindly because they see it dropped like 70%. This stock I'm sure has been highly manipulated to date, and probably will be more so than ever now with the warrants in play.  There are a lot offerings to backtest strategies with; I would recommend looking at what the stocks do in the weeks and months following. They set up opportunities, but jumping in right away is usually a little too blunt of an approach. Make sure to look at some offerings from a time period other than November-February this past year too, as that was an unusual period where the market was actually bullish on offerings.",stompingllama,2,/r/pennystocks/comments/nmkut6/condolences_to_anyone_that_was_already_all_in_on/gzrb628/,0.037,0.792,0.171,0.9887
14,SP," Thanks for the insight.  These are not my type of plays, but price action is definitely interesting to say the least.  Will be interesting to see how the SP moves over the next 1 month or so.  Not sure how they are going to fill an offering that is now well above the current market price?

EDIT:  Just realized the offering INCLUDES 1 full warrant so seems the difference in pricing is what the market feels is teh worth of that warrant, i.e. around 40-45c.",10xwannabe,2,/r/pennystocks/comments/nmkut6/condolences_to_anyone_that_was_already_all_in_on/gzrk0pl/,0.03,0.774,0.197,0.9353

What do the Institutional investors think?:

52% of the float is being held by institutions.  Orbimed   Advisors and NEA Management are the two largest share holders at roughly 8 million share a piece.
