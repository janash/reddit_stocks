42,GME," There's 2 parts to the hate and they both stem from what happened with GME. 

The first is the huge problem WSB has now with WSQanon. They really are huge conspiracy theorists that the whole system was rigged against them by the elite and Robinhood willingly sided with them to drop the price. This isn't helped by the fact they changed their statement from helping the customer to lack of liquidity. Poor public messaging on their part, cuz that only feeds the conspiracy. 

The second is the more rational side that Robinhood had a liquidity issue so why trust them with your money if another stock hits a high volatility again? Just move to another more reputable broker that can back huge volume trades. 

My personal take is that Robinhood was suffering from success. They were the #1 hot platform. Especially with new incoming traders jumping on the GME trend. Being the hot brokerage for newcomers, meant they are the ones that had the majority of the liquidity issues because they had the most trades happening, so of course they would have limited buying the longest. However, now that a lot of people have left to other apps, Robinhood raised another billion to be able to handle high volatile stock trading and there's no crazy hype, Robinhood is fine again.

Like, even if I was told by some higher being that this specific OTC was going to 1000x tomorrow I simply would not be able to buy it despite depositing cash days ago.

The stories are now kind of lacking details on what happened but this was around the same time people figured out box spreads and infinite leverage. Robinhood has a history of royally fucking up how they calculate buying power.

1. Let your profits run.
2. Cut your losses quickly.

For instance, Warren Buffet hasn't invested in weed stocks; however he has invested in companies likely to use cannabis in the future.

297,NYC," Negative, imo. The sector experienced blowout growth with Biden‚Äôs win, extended growth with Georgia‚Äôs runoff, consolidated through the end of January/early February, and the current run up coincides with major political catalysts, positive ERs (relatively speaking vs historical), and major positive catalysts roadmap this year (more states legalizing medical and/or recreational, and NY should legalize this or early next year and NYC alone is projected to be a **2 B-B-B-Billion dollar market. Colorado passed 2 billion just this year). **While I do think the moves over the past 2 days are hype and overbuying**, I think these valuations will return more organically later in the year (I suspect by Q3 with political catalysts being the major driver).

The marijuana sector is my portfolio passion and I follow it almost daily. Have been for years.

361,SNDL," My two cents for you all:

I want you all to make money but please don't make the same mistake twice. These aren't the prices these stocks should be going for. They are overvalued because they got pumped. This isn't long term (if it is that's fine, they will most likely eventually hit that price a while from now).

I do wanna say that I'm not saying these stocks won't go up more. Hell, even SNDL might shoot up to $30, you can never know. BUT, please just note that this isn't the correct value, because I've been hearing justifications for why the price is good and will go up more cuz weed business blah blah.

Weed stocks are STARTING to improve performance, but historically have been the worst investment in the history of trading (they were so high and just all crashed).

When EOW hits and SNDL is trading high at like 4 or maybe even 5 bucks a share then you will see that the google trends graph is going to be at 100 at that point in time,epicguest321,11,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lh4oj6/800_10800_tlry/gmvr00n/,0.0,0.923,0.077,0.5719

488,USA," Just as a heads up from a Canadian who lives and works in the greenhouse industry including greenhouses for Aphria. The owners of Aphria originate in a town called Leamington Ontario. (Formerly known as the Tomato capital of Canada now the Weed capital of Canada). 

They are one of dozens of multi million dollar greenhouse operations in the area. Most (not all but most) of these greenhouse owners also own property in the states. I know for a fact I have work on projects to build greenhouses for these companies in the USA (Ohio in particular) only under their American company‚Äôs name. 

Now I‚Äôm not saying that Aphria is one of these companies but many of these greenhouse operations are intermingled as a good percentage of them are Italian and all socialize together at the local Italian organizations (Roma, Ciacaro and Caboto clubs). Many of the families are related through marriages over the 3-4 generations that they have all lived in the area. I believe that similar to how they transitioned a former pepper and cucumber greenhouse site into what is now their Main operation, I believe Aphria will have its sights set to do the same in American once legislation is passed to allow the process to begin. 

The greenhouse operations are already multinational companies for their produce having operations in Canada, the USA and Mexico and I don‚Äôt believe the cannabis industry will be any different.

Cronos (CRON) - big tobacco's Altria (MO), the largest tobacco company in USA, backs this company with 45% ownership and will likely plug and play its products like a light switch into its huge point of service network of over 250,000 locations (i.e. convenience stores, etc) is the cannabis company that will likely be the ultimate winner. They are avoiding expensive growing methods by using a creative approach announcing the other day that they will be introducing synthetic cannabinoids for the Canadian market for a jaw dropping 10 cents a gram:

I'm new here and even I can see these weed stocks are a giant bubble and the retards saying ""SNDL to the moon"" are delusional bag holders in training.

That said, if SNDL does stay over $1 until EOW, getting permanent listing will likely result in a bit of a bump, so if it tanks today (as I think it will as big money takes profits and fucks retail) I might buy back in a little with house money.

Meaning I could sell short straddles and recoup the cost of my LEAPS in 4-5 weeks as long as IV remained high.

I gave myself room to run if the stock popped off but this was only a play until maybe June for me, unless something fundamentally changed of course.

If you like the company and got in at a good price I would hold, but you might consider selling a few shares and buying more when the price dips. Their P/BV was technically 3.0 when trading at $1.50 I think which is not too bad.

But also it is true, I have a regular ROTH IRA and regular investments and anything I do there is just fun and play money for entertainment value, that is a loss, but is an average persons, maybe some movie tickets or eating a a restaurant a couple times a year. Very small amounts. 

BUT, I also know, a few times and waiting and holding for 3 months, 6 months a year. Maybe I can scrape and be up $20. (and on some be way more down that $20, but it isn't an actual loss until you sell.)

AND I do know, contributing to my mutual fund etc, it just seems to stay stagnant, or very minimal percentage growth each year.

So, for me, I do not want robin hood and other places shut down, that is easy access for investing. YEAh, I have my own beefs about it.

But it is also like, having to put child safe caps on things because people are idiots and then ruin things for other people.

999,GME," At present time, the share value of GME does not matter. We have established that GME has a floor price of $40+ and that HF will not cover their shares at this price. We also know that with a short interest of roughly 78%, GME is still massively shorted. Simply put: there are not enough chairs when the music stops.


#The music will stop.


And when the music stops, HF will be forced to close their short positions. Mathematically, it is impossible to cover all shorts. They will have to buy our shares. That is a certainly and only a mayter of time. Why is this?


Because Gamestop is not dead. Gamestop has a future. Gamestop is changing courses for gamecentric e-commerce, hiring talent to lead the way. Every time Gamestop releases good news, that is another nail in the short positions' coffin.


The only thing GME owners have to do is hold. That's it. Hold. It may take weeks, months, maybe even a year or more but shorts will have to close. The bill comes due. It is inevitable.

1155,GME," I agree, also the entry fee to invest in weed isn't going to hinder your investment of GME if you so choose to invest. Not a financial advisor but if you consider the risk it somewhat becomes the idea of, ok while I have faith that GME will rise, would I rather get 1 stock of GME at 50 or try my luck at getting 33 stocks of Sundial, when it was at 1.50. In theory had your done that, now you have a 65.83 profit if you were to cash out, compared to GME that may of given you a +2 or -1 for the day. While yes GME does have the potential to achieve higher and potentially have a squeeze at some point, the diversify of your portfolio is not a bad thing because you can use it as a means to test the market and see what works and what doesn't work while making money along the way.

I personally am having fun dipping my funds into other stocks and seeing how they play out, it's a learning experience, sure I'm deep in the red in terms of my investments but what I gained from my losses is knowledge that allows me to work towards going into the green and achieving profits through my investment.

To each their own though, with the legalization of weed and pushing to make it more mainstream, it does make sense to consider investing in marijuana based stocks, because once it becomes legal to purchase, the odds of a surge intensify.",MagicHarmony,7,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lh8ui6/the_weed_rally_has_nothing_to_do_with_gme/gmw5nhn/,0.022,0.824,0.154,0.9889

1250,CAN," Truforma claims to use ‚Äòbulk acoustic waves‚Äô - that is sound waves - passed through these special diagnostic cartridges loaded into the machine to detect levels of what are essentially protein hormones in the blood of cats and dogs.   


In other words - looking at their video - the system relies on changes in the sound wave pattern depending on whether the particular hormone is present and at what concentration. The hormone binds with receptors in the cartridge, and these resonate at different frequencies depending on how much hormone is bound to the receptors.   


All sounds very clever. BUT: 

I would want to see proof these work besides the say so of Zomedica and Qorvo. Independent verification by third parties comparing results to known reference laboratories. I don‚Äôt see that at the moment.   


I‚Äôm sceptical sound waves can be so finely tuned and filtered to reliably detect such minute quantities AND changes in concentration. We are talking parts per million. I CAN understand how light is used in this way eg mass spectrometry.

1258,DD," OP did a pretty good job here, but something worth noting (God forbid I challenge the echo chamber) is that in nearly all cases adrenal disease in dogs and thyroid disease in dogs and cats is not an emergency situation. In the case of emergency adrenal failure, a vet wouldn't wait even 18 minutes for test results anyway and would stabilize the animal on an IV.


Truforma is a niche product with niche use cases in a niche market.


Just a few short years ago Zomedica had a whole slew of pharma products they were working on. Today there's no mention of them anywhere on their website. The company just shifted away in a cost-cutting measure. They also had a few other devices in their pipeline just a month ago when I made my DD video on it. Now they're scrubbed from their website.



This company is quite literally putting all their eggs in a tiny basket that's going to be tough to sell to veterinarians as a necessary product since the labwork it replaces is already cheap and the situations it's to be used in don't necessitate speed. They've also scrapped everything else their company has been working on with nary a word about it to investors.

1272,SNAP," As someone who has worked in vet med I am dubious of this product. 

This is not the only POC diagnostic system for adrenal or thyroid testing. The main competitor $IDXX you mention also has a POC diagnostic for both of these as well as several other SNAP tests that run within one machine and give result in similar timeframe.

While POC diagnostics are still a really great tool to have, many times these diagnostics will still need or want to be confirmed at a reference laboratory (such as $IDXX as mentioned) where much better and more sensitive testing can happen - POC will never fully replace a proper lab. 

I have seen a few POC diagnostic products come out and die within a couple years due to niche fits, expense, or lack of interest.

The other thing to know is vet med is not an industry that‚Äôs spending a shit ton of money on new toys all the time like human med. vet tends to be much more frugal and while it may end up cheaper if you are running these tests all the time, the break even point for these is quite high. Adrenal disease is not the most common, thyroid is more so, but other equipment will do these and more or the reference lab will remain cheaper for most.

1284,ZOM," TLDR; I've liked the stock since 25 cents, and again at 90, and again at 1.40. There are pros and cons listed below. You decide if a statement is pro or con.

I've been invested in ZOM since last year in the 20 cent range.

Basics

* The market they are entering is *estimated* to reach 2.8 billion by 2024. If they slice a 5% bit of that pie they will pull in 140 million a year.  Where that translates to market cap and share price are beyond my smooth brain.
* After the offering closes of 91 million shares at $1.90 today they'll have over 900 million shares outstanding with a 500+ million float.  This gives a price floor of $1.90.
* The offering was initially for 13 million shares and negotiated up to 91 million. This indicates a high demand for the stock where the company purchasing expects long-term growth well above $1.90.
* The Truforma platform isn't a one-off product, the system is designed to accept a multitude of assays. They have 50+ additional patents in the works and a myriad of new assays being formulated. If they manage to toss in cancer screenings and more basic rapid diagnostics such that the machine is a one-stop diagnostic shop, then they'll be an incredibly valuable company.
* A distribution agreement was signed on the 25th of January so they are ready to roll this product out.
* Zomedica did not create this system by themselves, they've partnered with QORVO the creators of bulk acoustic wave tech. (BAW) which is the driving force in the product. So licensing fees and shared profits will likely come into play.
* There is a competitor in this market called IDEXX. IDEXX RealPCR test takes 1 to 3 days to complete. Truforma's tests take less than 30 minutes.
* Truforma's accuracy has been tested against the standard slower tests and has shown to be highly accurate in comparison. So faster and just as accurate.
* The system is the size of a small printer so it will fit well in any veterinary office.
* The system takes cartridges and reagents that will be a source of residual income for Zomedica above and beyond the sale of the testing platform itself.",Faraday27,8,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lh8gnt/zom_255_zomedica_corp_is_about_to_skyrocketing/gmxow30/,0.02,0.86,0.12,0.9864
1285,ZOM," **I replied to your comment 25 minutes ago but just realized automod removed it because I talked about another stock under 1B. **

Reply:

Thanks for your critic point! 

Well I was very skeptical at the beginning about this stock, I did my research and found out that many biopharma companies have this kind of behavior when they become rilevant. For example, Zosano Pharma Corp didn't convince me because by doing my research I didn't find the ""fuel"" that could make it stay rising. In fact we've all seen what happened this week to it's price. 

ZOM is different, they invested heavily in their team, they are baked by giants like BlackRock that keeps increasing it position in it, but most importantly they have what we call here in Italy **substance**. 

In fact yesterday it showed how strong it was by not dipping and it's not even that popular as a stock, there were huge sell orders yesterday (I've seen a single one of 300k shares) but as many buy orders. 

For the price I'm pretty sure the price can certainly be over $4 if the team keeps working hard and announces how many units they'll ship. 

In 6 months I see it steadily rising to $8 if sales go well, be aware that they are releasing 3 other products in the future and the money they get from the offering will be used to speed up the process. This is why I said we could have a gem right here.

1287,ZOM," I work in the biotech industry making a similar device to test blood. Ultrasound is no easy tool to master. I have no doubt they are still optimizing their ultrasound transducers and probably have some issues or improvements in the pipeline.

Their revenue stream will come from a 1 time purchase of the device, and probably a subscription plan for the disposal cartridges. My company does the same thing. Buy the device, sign up for consumables and maintenance plan. I have no idea on cost of product for ZOM, but I would imagine it's in the 5-10k range for the device and 50+ per cartridge. It's not cheap developing something with 70+ patents. 

The cartridge uses capillary action to move sample through (I think, I doubt they have a pump moving the blood based on the size of the device). The cartridge is coated in antibodies that will bind to molecules that the reference lab is looking for to diagnose disease. Once bound, the antibody changes shape and this is how the ultrasound can detect disease. It's equivalent to a pregnancy test but tells you if your dog has diabetes. They claim they can detect down to pg/mL, which incredibly low amounts of substrate. This requires the transducer to be at 100% functionality with no defects. I have no idea how they could manage this since transducers of that level are almost certainly made ""by hand"" and involve human error. 

My bearish case assumes they are not ready to launch to market because of the complexities of transducer manufacturing, and scale up of cartridge production. The fact they coat it with antibodies means they need an organism to produce the antibodies and then be harvested and purified. It then needs to be applied to the cartridge. Imagine getting a false negative due to a manufacturing defect of the antibodies and your dog is interested for diabetes. Huge negative press release. They also need vets willing to pay a lot of money for an unknown and largely untested product. Idk much about the P/L on running a vet office, but I don't think vets do it for the money. 

I do think this is an excellent product, and thus making this a long term hold. The best thing that could happen is you buy in and ZOM gets acquired because this technology is worth it. I have no idea on target price but with a successful launch I would imagine $10+ is easy.",Undeadguy1704,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lh8gnt/zom_255_zomedica_corp_is_about_to_skyrocketing/gmxh76a/,0.106,0.803,0.092,-0.2833

1311,EDIT," I can answer some of these questions considering that my dog recently was diagnosed with thyroid disfunctions.


1. I'm not sure about adrenal disease but thyroid issues happen quite frequently, particularly with purebred animals. A good way to rougly estimate how many dogs have it is looking at sales for thyroid medication like thyro-tabs in the US or canitroid in europe.

2. I'm not sure about the price of this machine, but the test is fairly expensive (almost 3 digits in europe, possibly 4 digits in the US cuz no healthcare) and it's done with human-rated machines in human analysis labs. Results usually arrive between 2 and 4 days.


My only problem with this is that it sounds too good to be true, it almost feels like a theranos 2. I'll keep looking for research papers published by ZOM to see how they conducted the tests to ensure this thing actually works properly and i'll edit this when i find them.


EDIT:

nothing.

I scoured my university's database, google scholar, the archives, the umbral plains, your mom's fat folds, nothing.

This company has not published a single paper as far as i was able to discern.

1410,AMC," If you buy before the initial pump you might be fine trying to time the peak of the dump, but you never really know. I'd say there is a risk though of the stock falling further than it was before the pump due to long time holders selling out and possible short positions due to it being overly priced during the pump.  This definitely isnt fin ad though because I'm actually stupid and I've only been doing this for a couple months.

I bought AMC a while ago, I sold some at 17 but I still have some left. It's above where it was pre-covid and I think it will survive this whole thing so I'll keep holding it.

Edit:sorry looks like I read it wrong.  Yeah it might go back down and if you really believe in it, could be a good time to buy after the dump.

1458,GME," Honestly I'm okay with this. In the short term.

WSB spiked to eight million subs. Once GME crashed and burned and left a lot of newbies holding the bag, many of them have left. Pull up the subreddit stats and look at the number of posts and comments per day, it's dropped almost as fast as it initially spiked. Another smashing or two will hopefully filter out more of the people who can't handle the idea that stocks are a bet, and eventually it should go more or less back to normal.

What won't go back to normal is that we've made something of a name for ourselves. Any investment firm worth their salt has a scraper set up by now - or at least an intern or two. That won't stop. If they can get eyes on what a few hundred thousand people are thinking and doing, they will.

The bright side is that as more GME subscribers leave or stop coming, WSB should go back to having more widespread positions and DDs rather than everyone being focused on one or two tickers, so it won't be as easy for them to keep pulling it - especially once we stop being the media's boogeyman du jour and the eye of public opinion shifts away from us.",Ixolich,5,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhn7pk/have_they_turned_us_into_a_crash_machine/gmy7l7h/,0.017,0.885,0.098,0.9336

1461,GME," It seems like big money got burnt on GME, the ones not burnt jumped on against it. This basically means the market is currently trading as a risk value not a stock. When it hits reddit, the increased exposure nets a huge increase in volatility which is where swing trading shines. Whenever the stock does hit reddit, money switches gears and starts trying to ride the rise and surf the fall because as the volatility rises the odds of the higher swings rises as well.

1637,EV," Lol this is awesome. I took a stab at a GME valuation that might make you feel better. Automod won't let me post it on WSB, but here it is:

Cohen [sold](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chewy_(company)) chewy for $3.3 billion, when it had $2 billion revenue. This was before infinite money brrr valuations, in 2017. 

GameStop has an EV of about $4.4 billion (not counting receivables, inventory, and factoring debt) with pre-COVID revenue of $8 billion. This is before they became a worldwide symbol of sticking it to the man.

Assuming Cohen can only accomplish at GameStop what he accomplished at chewy and has no new tricks, he can easily get us to a $14-20 billion market cap with $8-10 billion in future revenue. That yeilds a post-turnaround share price of at least $200.

If we go further than this and assume Cohen can permanently increase GameStop's gross margins (digital sales of exclusive content) the sky is the limit. GameStop [already sells](https://www.thegamer.com/video-games-exclusive-gamestop-value-worth/) exclusive games, so this is not a huge stretch.

Amazon Google, Steam, Facebook, and Apple are also trying to become digital game distribution hubs with far greater volume than the console makers/studios. These companies have much larger platforms with several times the loyal users and they gave hoards of cash. They can simply add the same game titles and undercut prices to monopolize the market. 

GameStop suffered competitively and still does. Cohen is here to change that. With console makers and game studios facing the reality of being out-hubbed by much larger hubs, they will listen to proposals by an independent retailer like GameStop to diversify their distribution channels in a way that gives GameStop an edge (exclusive content, etc.).

The fact that GameStop is competitively outmatched right now doesn't determine it's value 5 years from now. Cohen beat Amazon in the pet business and I trust he can do it with GameStop. With all this in our smooth brains and given our shareholder loyalty, think of how long this squeeze will last. This is probably the next Tesla.

You can mock all you want.

You can bot all you want.

It will irritate you.

It will test you.

Smart money will jump on this quickly... 

Please realize that $APHA has A LOT going for it and is NOT a meme stock; so many catalysts:

 

1. Merger w TLRY
2. U.S. weed legalization
3. U.S. weed banking reform
4. European expansion (largest and only facility in Germany!), footprint in Portugal, Malta and other countries
5. Biggest LP in Canada (highest revenues, biggest % of market share)
6. Strong management, already profitable, great execution
7. Significant arbitrage play with the merger (compared to TLRY price) - 25-30% at present

$TLRY dropped this AM but this always happens; the squeeze play is real:

The only reason they both went down is profit taking + FUD (panic selling)

Tilray's weakness was it had terrible management but had great infrastructure  
Aphria's weakness was it's catered to canadian market but had great management  


With their merger.  Aphria's management takes over Tilray, and they inherit the infrastructure of Tilray, now they can cater to the US Market.  


And within the merger news:  
\- Opening up factories in Georgia  
\- Opening up a factory in German  
\- Recently aggressive expansion into UK

\- More European expansion (Unlike Cresco/Curaleaf which mostly caters to US Markets, Tilray is looking towards European growth on top of Canada/US)

2371,SENS," Type 1 Diabetic here. SENS is fixing to be a market disruptor. Has a ton of upside from a product standpoint. I'm a current dexcom user, love the device but this thing seems cool as hell. 

There is a ton of room for growth, but this is a long play. I'm guessing it's possible this company gets absorbed by a bigger player like ascencia or even dexcom who has been known to spend tons of $$ in r & d. I bought 23 shares @ avg 2.84  because I'm poor, but plan to hold for a while and it more when I can. I've been researching this company since November when a friend mentioned his dad and he sunk a ton of $$ into it at less than $1.00 a share. Should have been getting in then. But I take my time and talk to experts like my endocrinologist, and the actual company. Phil in investor relations is a cool dude. I've been taking with my docs to start the process of getting this as soon as the 180 day sensor becomes available in the US. 

My predictions are:

Short term this stock goes to $10
By july this stock should be around $20-30 and if the 180 day sensor is fda approved (highly likely) then $50. Diabetics love this tech. I love this tech.

Things I don't like: Decreasing free cash flow year-over-year. FCF for 2020 looks to be about -$58.7MM. Huge operating costs, gross income still looks negative for 2020. 2021 sales forecasted between $12MM-$15MM. Unless this implant can carry them through back half of 2021, this isn't really a good increase for them. I don't think the ~~500%~~ 342% growth ~~in this month~~ YTD is warranted, but hey price movement is king these days right?

Overall I see this play as a huge potential upside, but the financials scare me a bit.

2378,SENS," I am a T1 diabetic and use the FreeStyle Libre. I had a dexcom in the past but the amount of babysitting it took was too much for me. I had to put the sensor on every 10 days, then take my blood sugar with a meter twice to calibrate it, then it took an hour to activate and sometimes it wouldn't activate correctly and I had to start over and do the calibration again. Also putting the sensor on was a chore and the applicators cost way too much for what they were.

&#x200B;

The FreeStyle Libre is cheaper and the application of the sensor takes 1 minute rather than 10 minutes. The sensor on the Freestyle stays on with just the included adhesive better than the dexcom also in my experience. Downside of the FreeStyle is that it is less accurate and needs to be scanned to get a reading rather than having continuous every 5 minutes from bluetooth.

&#x200B;

For me the upsides of ease of use outweigh the downsides of accuracy. To me this new CGMS from SENS will have even more downsides for ease of use than even the dexcom, and I am not sure if it has more upsides. If they can get it to be 365 days and make it so you can get it implanted at your yearly endocrinologist appointment I think that would go a long way towards ease of use. I already have enough doctors appointments I have to go to if I have to make another different appointment twice a year for this I may not do it.

&#x200B;

Just my two cents from a life long T1 Diabetic. I will still buy the stock as I think they will be bought by dexcom even before they figure out the specifics with the implant.",Lipppp,5,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhj9dh/alright_apes_i_got_a_good_one_for_you_listen_up/gmyax0x/,0.017,0.913,0.071,0.9344

also DXCM already has tie ins with several of the biggest pump manufacturers, which use DXCM to make a partially closed loop delivery system (which is the longer term play).

(for context, I am also type 1. these types of sensors have been under discussion and 'just about to take over' for years at this point. there are serious, serious concerns around requiring an outpatient procedure, vs. something you self apply and get in the mail. this is not a meaningful upgrade to existing external monitors, which are already 10 days and looking towards 30 days, and are much, much less invasive).",sevenbee,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhj9dh/alright_apes_i_got_a_good_one_for_you_listen_up/gmz0k23/,0.063,0.866,0.071,0.4013

2409,SENS, When their 365 days product gets approved it will be a game changer. There‚Äôs a long term value in SENS and it will only get better and better. Look at their institutional holding portfolio and it will tell you who the major players are. I have 10k shares and I‚Äôm long term bullish. They already have a deal with UnitedHealth and more insurance companies will get on this when they realize less frequent doctor visits which in turn saves patients time and money.,kiddo987,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhj9dh/alright_apes_i_got_a_good_one_for_you_listen_up/gmz8tvw/,0.0,0.849,0.151,0.9042
2410,SO," In it's current form I definitely agree, but it's potential for 180 day usability or even longer is cool to me. Personally I hate having to wear two sticky things (pump and cgm) so only having one adhesive on at a time would make me interested. My SO has an implantable birth control that was given under the skin and she's had zero discomfort and minimal scarring, it's barely noticable.

I agree also that pump integration will be key. If they collaborate with Medtronic or another large pump company that could take things up a notch.

2416,USA," The 90 day eversense is great. No defaults and patients already used. This is heavily added into a lot of medical insurance policies.  The 180 day Fda evaluation is just a key to a walk in the park. Sens was ready for this evaluation in October,  but the heavy paperwork traffic of others filing for approval on top of the pandemic,  everything was pushed back. So what I am saying is, it's not a matter of ""if"" the FDA approves, it's a matter of ""when"" . Which is not to far from bow. A foreign country has already indulged heavily in senseonics because they know too th at the product is stable and great for the future especially during covid effects. This us a breakthrough product. Great market cap for a ln upcoming stock. Imagine when it hits the USA what will happen. Yes it's based in USA,  but its majority contributors are outside of the country. Once FDA aproves, the USA will immediately join in on a massive interest. It will go up, and it will not come down to these current prices ever again. Its possibilities of price range in my opinion Is anywhere from a new floor of 20 and a high of 50-63 by Jan 2022.. by this summer? Maybe 16-30 lowest and 26- 48 high ..

2418,IP," no doubt that is a major concern. Where I think THIS sensor has a major edge, is that it is rated more accurate than the largest player in the space, which is dexcom. That can do 2 things. Either it will accelerate market penetration for this device, or...it will make this ripe to acquisition to gain the IP behind it being more accurate. Dexcom would be that player and they are looking to diversify their product holdings. They have a device now that is no question is the market leader. I wear it right now. But what they can do with it is getting limited and crowded. It is 1 dimensional. During the Pandemic Dexcom offered CGMS and phones to hospitals to limit healthcare workers exposure and to save PPE. That will continue to grow. But if Dexcom takes over this company it will allow them to offer a device for primary care individuals to study blood sugar (Dexcom Pro already here), Their new Dexcom G7 (coming this year), and possibly a Dexcom implantable (Sens being acquired). 

&#x200B;

My bet is that SENS does have a ton of headwinds, but the tailwinds more than make up for it. They have terrific strategic partners in Ascencia in Europe (I also use Ascencia's Countour One meter which is most accurate I have experienced) which could ALSO be a player to acquire or help grow.

When they merge, APHA shareholders will be due to get 0.8 shares whilst TLRY holders will retain their shares. It‚Äôs a no brainer tbh, buy APHA.

FOMO is a real bitch and i have learned this lesson the hard way right when starting to learn about investing. it is very important for me to start doing true DD and instead of relying in apps and such, i should actually read and immerse myself into the world of stocks. so yes, i agree with OP. dont assume others have ur best interests at heart (or rather ur bags) and believe they will all hold bc at the end you will be getting screwed over. everyone is playing to their field, like it or not.

2807,GME," So out of all honesty, I bought GME when it was at 408$. I was so in the hype and excited to be actually fighting against ""billionaires"" with a whole community of people, that I didn't for a second think, that these billionaires probably own the god damn stock market. They own everything. Soon they will probably own the air we breath.  I was even more excited when Elon said he would send us to space. I thought we had a chance. Deep down. I still want to believe that we do. All I wanted was for GME to hit 1000. HISTORY WOULD HAVE BEEN MADE if we would have sent ourselves to space. God damn, it would have been something spectacular. It would have been beautiful.

But now brothers and sisters... I fear that we might have lost the battle.  Like in all wars, us, the soldiers, fight till the death. We give our lifes for something we believe in, and lose everything, while our commanders get rich, with minimal blood spilt.  Our commaders sent us to the front line so that we can get fucked while they plan their big escape, grabbing all the riches for themselves, while we believe that they would take us with them. That was never the plan. It never is... 

I am still a diamond handed soldier... staring the grim fate of our stocks in the eyes. Diamond handed because I have nothing else left to lose. Selling is not an option. I'd be shooting myself in the head. So I wil go out. Guns blazing. Fighting a battle I know I will Lose, but with honor... If by any chance I'm wrong. And I'm fighting , surrounded by the enemy with no way out, and as I look to the sky in my final moments and see the cavalry arriving in the thousands, to take us up and lift us to space, I will kneel down and apologise for having doubts... But I fear for the worse. It has been a great battle brothers and sisters. Stay strong. Give them hell. And just maybe.

I do hold a few GME shares but only delusional people actually think the stock is worth 1k. The only reason people believed it would go high is because a HF would be forced to buy at an over price not because the company would realostically be worth that much. 
Tilray has the potential to become the number 1 company at an untapped legal market which makes it very valueable LONG term.

TLDR: $350? Forget about it. $60-$100, sounds reasonable long term based on new ""online business"" model

First we assume that the .83 is what the shares will convert at when they merge (no funny business like they ch age it). Now with that said, there is real arbitrage to be had any time these two are not in the exact .83 ratio. You short the higher one (TLRY) and long the lower one (APHA) in relative proportions. It locks in gains equal to the delta between the current ratio and .83. Don‚Äôt worry about the details beyond that b/ YOU can‚Äôt do it anyways. Now the question is, if there is arbitrage RIGHT NOW, why aren‚Äôt MMs taking it? 

Above is all fact. Now these are my thoughts on what we‚Äôre seeing which may be debatable. 

TLRY has a decent SI already (not sure of exact number but it‚Äôs not low). In order to arbitrage you need to short TLRY (as described above). The problem is these shares are getting harder to find to short. You also have massive buying b/ of the Europe news and that leads to fomo or more buying. Now cost to borrow goes up which puts a wrinkle in the arbitrage play. You also get more susceptible to short squeeze when you have to short TLRY to try and arbitrage. So TLRY is squeezing now. Mostly Gamma right now. Did you see the volume in 2/12 65c today! Holy shit. People who opened up positions to arbitrage are getting margin called b/ the price is going against them (even tho it must self correct when they merge). Essentially arbitrages are getting squeezed out of liquidity to maintain their arbitrage until it comes around to be settled (i.e. merger).  It‚Äôs a very interesting scenario and I‚Äôm sure some of what I‚Äôm shilling here is occurring. TLRY could just keep exploding via squeeze but the real underlying fair value of TRLY seems to be APHA divided by 0.83, not the other way around.

Great post, based on reading older posts about the GME fiasco, it seems there is a dwindling amount of float of GME shares and this is definitely going to be reflected in the price movement.

As the available float decreases, buying and selling actions will have a greater impact on the share price - buying --> rockets, selling --> stonk go down.

3052,GME," Don't worry, you're good, I'm not gonna get bothered by someone on reddit haha.

I understand what you're saying, so wouldn't GME being that high then mean that the people who are holding GME shares aren't selling them? Less people selling, means shares are more scarce, means volatility is through the roof (which it is), and thus this analysis is basically confirming that there's no mass selling going on (at least not today, keeping in mind the mass selling might have already occurred)?",Blakred,12,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lh99ir/gme_volume_vs_price_linear_regression_analysis_a/gmw07vy/,0.05,0.818,0.132,0.7595
3053,GME," Scarce shares doesn't mean that no one is selling. Just that shares are harder to obtain. This may sound like the same thing but they arent. A multitude of factors affect a brokers ability to obtain shares. Maybe my broker (Fidelity) has large institutional ownership, therefore if I want to buy a share they have them readily available. In theory, this would have little effect on pricing compared to a broker that has to go on the exchange and find a share, raising the bid until someone lets a share go. How much float is available? Failure to delivers. This scarcity is common in a widely shorted security. GME is an interesting case study. But I believe the study youve done here proves that shares are hard to come by. What it doesn't prove (and nothing can) is why are shares so scarce.",IFromDaFuture,12,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lh99ir/gme_volume_vs_price_linear_regression_analysis_a/gmw1hot/,0.038,0.745,0.216,0.9726
3054,GME," 1- If there are more transactions, there are also more sells. Mentioning buys and sells is meaningless. What you‚Äôre saying is that ‚Äúwhen there are more transactions there are more transactions.‚Äù No shit. 

The dude is talking about volume and the correlation of said volume to price action. Not mentioning an increase in transactions in regards to buying pressure doesn't make sense. Additionally, you're ignoring the purpose of whoevers making the trade and that would be a mistake also. HFTs move differently than Long Term holders. This causes discrepancies in buy vs sell side volume all the time. So acting like increased volume stays at an even balance would be a fallacy. If this were the case there'd be no need for brokers.

2 - How the fuck do you imagine a stock becomes more scarce? People burning stock certificates? The global oil supply can become scarcer. Low transaction volumes do not mean scarcity. They mean sellers and buyers are relatively further apart on valuation than periods with higher transaction volumes

I didnt say low transaction volume is due to scarcity. I said that the spread on bid vs ask can be widened by share scarcity. Which is a fact that I don't understand why you would argue with that?

Fundamentals in regards to GME dont matter. The FTDs alone are a clear indicator of share scarcity. And that scarcity is an obvious cause for the increased price action st increased volume.

3055,GME," I haven't performed any checks, like I said in the post, this is a super basic linear regression. I haven't normalized the data, or really processed any of it at all. 

I also believe that the analysis is flawed simply because it covers half of one day. My point in posting this ASAP was to get feedback from more knowledgeable people to see if there are any next steps. This isn't meant to give anyone the impression that GME = BUY N HOLD. Nor is it meant to say there's a conspiracy going on.

The results for today, so far, aren't in line with yesterday's. But then again, today is only one data point, I'd like to keep doing these for at least a week to check for patterns, time permitting.

Also, like I added somewhere in the post, regardless of the technical aspects of the analysis, it is one more ""weirdness"" related to GME. Since effectively we're going against Shorters, the playfield is shady as fuck, with firms misrepresenting their short numbers for example, so at this point my reasoning for holding isn't reasoning, it's just a gut feeling.

3129,BB," Thanks everyone.  My non-financial advise from my crayon eating ape brain is this stonk is undervalued. They are positioning themselves with Amazon, Baidu, Motional etc. around BB QNX design. The coof  has slowed down the consumer auto industry with QNX embedded in them. Hence lower earnings in 2020. The coof is hurting business and sales but this is temporary.  Yes, this is a long buy and hold. BB earnings report is MARCH 31, 2021.
On another note, BB also signed a licensing agreement with OnwardMobility out of Austin, TX to design a new BlackBerry branded cell phone (I know it might be Android based, I miss my old crackberry). https://www.onwardmobility.com

3196,BK," You have it generally right. However, you don't have to actually execute an option if you buy. You can sell the option at any time. You also don't need to diamond hand them until they expires as worthless. Did I buy puts for SNDL this morning and flip them at 50% mark up 30 minutes later... yes I did because I like that return rate. I also have had a lot of vaccines... 

You are unlikely to find much value in $0.10 options. You are also unlikely to find good value at $1 stocks. The reason, stocks less than a dollar run the risk of delisting from major exchanges, which is not bueno. Don't spend your time kicking around stocks just because they are cheap. If you want to trade options (a generally terrible idea, but god I love them), look for things YOU think are likely to move big in one direction or the other and buy something that actually has a chance to end ITM. Keep in mind I am/nor is anyone here your financial advisor. Play these games with money you can afford to lose and not care about. If $100 is a lot, DON'T DO IT. If you are learning, I highly recommend stock purchases. Why? if you are wrong, you won't BK on your first roll of the dice because you actually own something that is probably not going to drop to zero in a week.

3226,IMO," I'm actually thinking of getting puts on Nasdaq (QQQ) instead of SPY. This coming crash should hit tech/high-valuation companies the hardest. That said, SPY might not be a bad choice now given that Tesla's there now. The 50-day MA is sitting at 10.7k versus the current price which is 13.9k for nasdaq. Something I rarely see anyone talking about either is how the nasdaq nearly doubled in value in less than a year from the covid crash - that's truly retarded.

I've been putting together a few ranges that I think we might see it happen in:

* May-July 2021 if we keep going up and there is no sideways motion - note also that this is a period where people might start being able to go outside more and pandemic restrictions may start lifting (less money flowing into the markets to keep prices high). I think this is something that most people looking into how the pandemic is exacerbating the bubble forget about when they are trying to determine when the bubble might burst.
* Once the average valuation hits dotcom levels and I can't put a range on this yet. Best guess is around 1-2 years away. But that's basing on the rate of change of the dotcom bubble. It might be faster this time around because of how easy it is for anyone to trade.
* The third catalyst that I think would make this tumble is covid restrictions being completely lifted, QE ends, money printers stop, and people stop pouring money into the market. This is assuming it doesn't happen by this summer, so it would be about 1 year out IMO.",OkDog99,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lh4926/something_seems_off_in_the_matrix/gmvye9y/,0.063,0.883,0.054,-0.09

The fund also gives free monies every quarter.

There's also Horizons (HMUS) which is more US exposure and just happens to be splitting 3:1 on Friday ($40.02 close today)

I think you're referring to a gamma squeeze, but a gamma squeeze can occur at any time during the week. Shares are not magically bought in a large block on Fridays when options expire, they happen all the time when MMs delta hedge. When an MM sells you a call, they will have to buy the equivalent number of shares to its delta, and if the call increases in delta they will have to buy more shares. That is what drove TLRY up yesterday, not a short squeeze but a gamma squeeze. Also, days to cover is quite low, hovering around 1. Theoretically, shorts can all cover within a single trading day, which means a short squeeze is almost impossible. Lastly, MMs actually opened up strike prices up to 100, and will continue to do so as long as price rises. The chance of a gamma squeeze at this point is quite low, unless Elon tweets ""TLRY good"" or something.

The news you listed is definitely bullish, but don't count on another gamma squeeze or short squeeze to push the price up further. Not financial advice.",Awfu1M1n3r,21,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lh52hz/tlry_dd_42069_gainz/gmvdfhj/,0.059,0.842,0.099,0.7888

3453,APHA," If I'm not mistaken, after the merger of Tilray & Aphira, the new Aphira will be the largest cannabis company on the planet. Given their incredible distribution, diversified businesses, production capabilities, AND the chance of US federal legalization under Biden, I think assuming a pullback is reasonable - caution is always reasonable - but some, like me, might consider it pessimistic. 

Some real artists might wonder where $MO will source weed if US legalization happens ü§î

Those of us that recall the Canada Weed Stonk Fever of '18 (I'm *still* üíéüôå holding some bags) might advise you to buckle up and watch the news before you set a stop loss and get booted out of your position.

Remember [the Hindenburg Report on Aphira? Ah, memories.](https://hindenburgresearch.com/aphria-a-shell-game-with-a-cannabis-business-on-the-side/) I bought more.

3516,SNDL," If they bought all those shorts yesterday sitting at $2.95, and SNDL is around 4.20 at premarket. They're not going to be buying ANYTHING at that price, so any pressure from having to cover shorts wouldn't be until some serious dips.

3658,OR," There's gonna be an explosion in the entire weed industry if federal recreational use ever happens. However right now the gamble is picking the right company, as far as I know none of the marijuana companies are really allowed to operate across state lines, at least they're not allowed ship product across state lines. 

I feel like the west coast companies in NV, CA, OR and WA might be the stronger companies right now, but I think if federal legalization happens they'll be too busy competing in the immediate vicinity to expand far outward. Colorado is an obvious contender, theyve got the most history with rec but are still kinda close to the coast.

Honestly if Missouri goes recreational, I think those will be the marijuana companies to invest in. The area is not only great for growing, but their neighboring states are almost guarenteed to legalize AFTER the feds. Hell prohibition wasnt even fully over in kansas until like the 80's.

Compare revenue to the big beer companies. Look at what revenue is now for these weed companies. You'll see there's a huge gap. Weed is fun and pricey and regulated like booze can be.

Also, an oz of weed is worth a TOUCH more than an oz of wheat.. Jesus Christ.. they are basically growing gold.  The price will decrease over time but they are growing gold. 

Lastly, OP.  What percent of Americans have access to legal weed? What percent of Americans will have access to legal weed in the long run? Ok then then.

I anticipate exponential growth from all these companies with good business models. We can't even really invest in the good USA companies yet, most of these companies popping are international.

Think about the potential to buy weed online? Have it delivered?

3660,CRON," If you know how some of the markets are arranged, you would know that some have vertical integration.  Which means they have to grow, harvest, package, and sell the product.  In a market like Florida, where even if recreational is approved, this vertical integration will stay in place.  Which eliminates the need for Weedmaps realistically since the companies all have rewards programs, text and email solicitation, etc....

&#x200B;

A small risk it either vertical integration being eliminated (which for the consumer is great but investors not so much) which I doubt will happen in the next few years minimum AND/OR home grow is legalized which many consumers will TRY but when they see there is an art to growing, harvesting, drying/curing/storing weed they will go back to buy from stores.

I owe y'all thanks if this pans out since I first heard about it here.",ThatWideLife,8,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhf756/itt_we_take_guesses_at_the_sndl_rugpull/gmx8kkl/,0.051,0.692,0.257,0.9511
3738,EOD," 8th and 9th had most of the short action, explaining the upswing, 10th however had a HUGE short volume, biggest this year, which is probably HF's reloading up on shorts @ $2.95, but it's trading at $4.20 around 4:20am premarket....

I genuinely think some other big firms started buying in the 9th because you almost NEVER saw short volume fall below 50% of total volume, and it was only \~30% Tuesday for FINRA.

**Pessimist View:** If I had a shit ton of money and could do off-exchange markets, I'd drive premarket up even more to start off a HUGE sell at market open, crashing the price and getting downward momentum to cash in my shorts, halting gains. And stoners set limits at $4.20 last week and are too high to change it/remember where their phone is.

**Optimist View:** 10th didnt really have the short action behind it, and after hours has only gone up more. Increase could genuinely be from people and FOMO, media buzz, etc. and SNDL's no debt, $600M in cash, and **that they sell weed!**

&#x200B;

I think buying spike at open, a bit of a sell off in first half, if it falls below 3.50, then ends today around 3.00, but if it's still above 3.50 by noon, makes it to $5+ by EOD.

We got our TMP vans and company trucks taken away from us in the military and were issued GEM vehicles. It's not that any President specifically said ""the military will use electric vehicles"" it was more like ""we want to push this purchase, so you're going to get these whether or not you want them.""

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Electric_Motorcars

They weren't terrible vehicles for what they were, but they were a compromise. That's the way I see this contract happening. The Administration is going to get the USPS new vehicles, and some of them are going to be electric, some hybrid, and they'll be made here in America with union workers. All of what I wrote will be true, mostly, except some of that will be compromise, just like those GEM carts that we got.

There was an increased number of shares available to short after the 29th and the number of shorts keeps increasing as well as interest on existing short positions decreasing drastically.

Why we should believe, without evidence, that the hedge funds would lie about their short positions now despite the last (and much worse) reports showing far worse data (in terms of risks to the hedge funds) for months prior. Why would they lie now after being truthful about a 140% SI?

4080,IMO," There‚Äôs some holes in their reporting. Telecom reporting is always wacky because the companies that still have copper write it down pretty substantially as it will eventually disappear. I personally didn‚Äôt like the decrease in revenue coupled with a decrease in expenditures on the network. International was down as well as majors and SMB.. consumer held steady but you really want to see some growth in enterprise. Wholesale being down was a surprise as well, with L3 they hold a dominant position in backbone and with 5G rolling out I really thought wholesale would bump up as carriers get ready.

Overall they massaged the numbers showing a nice bump in EPS but no real growth in any segment.. the price of transport has been declining for years and this will continue to be a drag for them.

For me personally (not a professional) I don‚Äôt see anything to be very excited about. I didn‚Äôt listen to the call so I don‚Äôt know what the guidance is on the edge computing stuff - but that‚Äôs really the only new thing they are pushing, wireline is dead, there‚Äôs enough dark fiber in the US to keep prices stagnant for a long time. They were able to get some better financing rates on their massive debt but that didn‚Äôt translate into any meaningful profit increase.

They are paying a massive (near 10% dividend) which is great and they can easily pay it... but it‚Äôs also the bane of this stock IMO because you don‚Äôt want to be holding a bunch of this and wake up one morning to find they cut the dividend in half because that would be very bad for the share price.

If you have enough capital - your broker might let you naked sell calls, but you need to be able to pony up in case of assignment. The loss is infinite so I wouldn't recommend it.   


I think corsair will see 50-60 in a few months - but not within next week. We ranged 35-40 for like a month in December so I believe this will take some time as well. My opinion? Roll these out to further expirations if you can afford it. April or May even.

4101,BY," I'm a retard when it comes to stocks...but I'm pretty successful when when comes to online dating. Been on Tinder since it started in 2012. Bumble since it came to Android in like 2016 and Hinge the most recent one. 

Hinge is BY FAR the best app at the moment. Has the best algorithm for matching people with equal attractiveness levels and shared hobbies. I don't know who owns hinge but their business model isnt very good because I don't pay a dime on there and I'm constantly getting dates. Bumble was annoying because women will match you but never start the conversation and tinder was great for while, especially its business model with the premium members getting to pick their location to swipe in so you could swipe in a city before going there...Tinder is the only dating app I've actually put money into 

Male thirst is an endless resource but I just don't know many guys putting money into Bumble. They all put money into tinder or just go for free on hinge.",SpinPlates,31,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lh6hfe/bmbl_big_time_play/gmvpa7j/,0.048,0.813,0.139,0.9372

4105,DD," Regardless of the quality of all the DD opinion here, I think the worst part is to compare what Match+Tinder is trading at. Bumble doesn't have the same name with people that either of those have. Match has been around forever. Comparing an IPO price to that is like comparing Quibi to Netflix. Yes, similar products in the long run but one just doesn't have the gravitas (or a service anymore).

For people who actually like this DD, JUST CHILL. The stock will probably move down in the short term, yeah battery tech make stock go brrrrrrr but the company needs revenue and orders to justify concrete stock movements. Neat technologies don't justify stock prices, profits do.
