24,DB," So this guy's dad worked for DB and he got his hands on a bunch of internal docs. Val had been shopping them around to journalists (while being pretty open about not knowing what kind of info he was sitting on) and the feds. 


I know one story that came from his leaks was DB getting yelled at by someone at the fed for having crappy records. Otherwise I am unfamiliar with what he's released - if it's under investigation maybe no one outside the FBI knows.


I'll say he fits the classic whistleblower trope: former drug addict, manic behavior, generally an unreliable narrator. Seems like everyone who works with him know this but are still intrigued by the data he has. 


Given that, I could both of these outcomes being equally plausible:


1) He has information that put him in danger and people had him killed 


2) He went on a manic bender and self destructed

I think this is really good news for MindMed because even if the prices goes up a bit from the NASDAQ listing, it's still not even close to where the price will be after a successful clinical trial. So after the listing will still be a great time to buy. I think this stock will continue to be criminally under valued until we get our successful clinical trial result.

I also think the stock will continue to be undervalued because wall street boomers have been propagandized from a early age to fear psychedelics (see the DARE program) despite the fact that LSD is significantly safer than alcohol, weed, nicotine, caffeine (yes, really), and basically every other drug.

192,CMPS," Price targets for NASDAQ Day? 
My guess is $6.80 minimum.

I'm basing this on. Compass Pathways 71% increase on their NASDAQ Debut. 
Yes MMED has already rallied 68% on the news of uplisting. However. At $2.70 CAD last week it was highly under valued (possibly insider knowledge of F8). So the 68% rally thus far has put us in around the $4 mark which I would argue is close to true value. So $4 x 1.7 =$6.80 which is a 70% increase. Also I am not sure if Compas Pathways announced their NASDAQ listing publicly for a pre listing rally. Anyone able to confirm when CMPS announced IPO, how many days before listing.

I also think with the MMED following being stronger than Compass we could be looking far beyond 70% or $6.80 shares? Whats everyone's thoughts on this?",StickIndependent5222,9,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mxqflk/a_case_for_buying_and_holding_mindmed_mnmd/gvqtn44/,0.029,0.829,0.142,0.9399

Most likely, they just want to get this done while the market's already in a rally. This could be to take advantage of positive PR to help boost their numbers more than normal, or it could even be to offset an earnings miss that otherwise might push their numbers below their typical support. It could be that most big tech companies report this week or last week and they didn't want to miss out. Or it could be absolutely nothing at all.

298,HUGE," What do you mean ""optimize for outcomes?"" That's all great and well for non-medical professionals, but it's a lot of hand waving and euphemisms at the end of the day. 

At the core of health insurance game is: insurers generate revenue by taking premium from policy holders. In the case of medicare advantage insurance providers, they also get a capitated payment (lump sum per person) from the govt. 

from that pool, they then have to turn a profit by spending less on paying for the medical services that policy holders undergo. There is nothing in their shitty app or ""technology"" that prevents people from getting sick. For that matter, no other insurance company has discovered that magic bullet either, because it's a medical/science issue, not a business or programming issue. 

Successful insurance providers do this by risk pooling, controlling costs/negotiating reimbursement rates, and denying services.

Traditional insurers have a huge moat because they:

1) risk pool millions of policy holders, essentially stealing premium from heathy people to pay for sick people's care. The heathy people are net positive revenue, the sick people are net-negative revenue. 

2) negotiating down payments to hospitals and providers. When you have millions of policy-holders you can pay a hospital 900 versus 1000 dollars for an admission or whatever. 

3) negotiating down the cost of medicines with pharmaceutical companies. Same principle applies.

4) Denying services by making it fucking impossible for people to get the care they need. Taking a cue from HMOs, you can require policy holders to only see doctors in your network or make them get crazy/onerous pre-approvals or referrals before you agree to pay for an expensive service like scans or surgeries.

All of these tactics require economies of scale - ie millions of policy holders. Clover has less than 100,000. It's got a shitload of hurdles:

1) cost of acquiring many many many more policy holders.

2) negotiating reimbursement with hospitals and providers. As of recently, they were actually paying doctors to use their app/ be part of their network. Good tactic but ultimately unsustainable and potentially illegal/unethical to use inducements to influence physician decision making. 

3) Creating a network of physicians your policy holders actually want to see. Unfortunately there is an alarming increase in providers who just wont see medicare patients, let alone jump through to the ridiculous added circus hoop of an app from Clover. At the end of the day, if you've only got one or two shitty specialist doctors in your network that take months to see, you're gonna get dropped by customers pretty quick.

The existing insurers have HUGE MOATS. Even regular medicare from the government has a huge moat because it defacto covers all americans over 65. So like 60-100m people and its revenue is guaranteed by the tax payers and its ability to negotiate is essentially completely one sided and enforced by law. Doctors and hospitals take what medicare gives or they don't and that's that. 

So, no offense to OP or any of the other believers, but being an insider in healthcare, this company does not have solid fundamentals in any way. Their apps and code are not the hammer that are gonna solve the essential problems of preventing people from using medica services.

Anyhoo, short term this may be a good momentum/meme play, but long term this company is gabrage. I'm going to open up long dated put and bear spreads on this shitspac as soon as FAANG earnings report and I can free up more capital.",ktn699,11,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mxepbk/clov_yolo_do_i_have_the_most_shares_here/gvqbm51/,0.089,0.768,0.144,0.9908

368,RKT," My opinion has always been it's not a bagholding stock unless people bought on the day of the spike. I have posts detailing the fundamentals and outlook of the company. There were lots of people complaining that RKT was shit, and I was trying to provide my reasons why I think it's undervalued, since I did some research before investing before the spike. Is there anything wrong with that?

I did think there should have been a second melt up but I was proven wrong so far. I was holding for the long term and still will be, I just sold any short dated calls on the earlier spike and happy with that. Position can mean position on a matter, not just stock position. I haven't sold my shares if that's what you're asking.

So you're saying you can just whip up any conclusion, and as long as there aren't evidence against (there is, you just didnt read my post before jumping to that conclusion), you are justified?

To illustrate how ridiculous this is: Then I think you are a pedophile and happy to be proven otherwise, but there really isn't any evidence to show my suspicion is unjustified.",CMScientist,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mxeyh2/short_india_inda_indy_epi/gvqgau9/,0.092,0.836,0.071,-0.3489

460,TA," Anticipating a move up this week, I’m not a TA expert but looks like the primary uptrend is still intact. Still trading in a consolidation zone which can last a while like it has in the past. I’ve seen multiple threads on here expecting a price target of 55-60, but I will happily take profits at 40.

466,ASO," ASO is a slow play. Might be solid and all, but 3-4 days of mvis gives 80% share hike vs a few %up and down (and round and round).

If earnings and earnings alone is what will propell this thing then it's not much point focusing on it. Get shares or play your options ahead of earnings and focus on all the other sweet rides available in the meantime. 

I sold out of aso so I haven't really been paying attention to speculations amd developments, but current share price seems to be about where I sold so I could go back in with +80% shares after some mvis.",ammahamma,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mxo223/did_everybody_forget_aso/gvqtpnj/,0.021,0.796,0.182,0.9501
