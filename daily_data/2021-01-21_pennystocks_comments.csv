 I wonder if there's a sub exclusively and explicitly for pump and dump schemes. Maybe all the scammers could go there instead and plan their schemes there. Kind of like r/wallstreetbets where everyone puts money into GameStop for no fucking reason, inflating the stock and making everyone money.

$ATOS

COVID nasal spray and breast cancer trials any day now

Atossa have almost $100M in cash. Multiple products in the pipeline, ready to be announced any day now. CEO with huge experience in medicin. Offerings done for a long time. Cash burn approx $1M per month. Ton of reasons why this could be a winner this year.

All the analysts rates this as a ""Strong Buy""

&#x200B;

BNGO, Bionano Genomics, have now a Market Cap of $1.9B. A company that just in December was valued around $50M. And they pumped up to $1.9B in a matter of weeks. A company that doesnt have any meaningful income ($7M in 2020), debt ($19.5M in 2020) that overgrow their income.

Yet they pumped over some news in December.

Atossa on the other hand have a Market Cap of just $90M. They have over $60M in cash, and with the warrants waiting to be sold, they will have probably close to $100M. Liabilities is only at $1.5M.

&#x200B;

You see the difference? Atossa have far more cash than liabilities. They have cancer drug and covid drug in the pipeline close to news right now. And the best of it, they will go over 20x from todays price if bio investors go crazy over this stock too.

Catalysts:

The road ahead:

1.ATOS is set to present at a COVID conference on the 26th

In terms of different precautions, you are again absolutely right that there are  contact precautions (eg, c. Diff) But there are various respiratory precautions based on their modes of transmission too. For instance, infections that are “aerosol transmission” aka airborne transmission require isolation rooms with negative pressure and filtrate respirators like N95. Other “droplet” bugs like bordetella, influenza or paramyxovirus only require surgical masks because they are not “aerosol”.

Notice the graphics for contact precautions doesn’t say aerosol anywhere, it says airborne. Nobody even uses the word aerosol in a hospital setting except in the lab where face shield are worn because of the belief or chance that a tube of liquid serum in a vacutainer with the small amount of pressure can aerosolize.

I got in at $4.05 and out at $4.75 for a quick 17-18% gain. Could I have made alot more? Sure, but I will take 15-20% profits anyday especially in a volatile stock. Another trick is to use a trailing stop loss for it to trigger on dips, but a large dip or halt won't save you.

Personally

I do this

Find stock that has catalyst coming up within 2-3 months.

Next step

Check if that stock has had small run up.

Next step  if yes I buy small position so I don’t miss on potential moon.

Next step if no buy medium sized position.

Continuing Yes

Wait for Dip and buy heavy with plans to sell 2-3 days before News release.

The legalization in the US will only boost the visibility of a company like this, a huge influx of businesses into Cannabis will create competitors looking for an edge.

ABML is massively overvalued. Let me explain:

1. ABML has over 1 million in convertible notes which have been converting every quarter. 

2. ABML has been using offerings to keep up its cash reserves. And its cash reserves are LOW.

3. ABML market cap is over 1 billion now, with ZERO revenue. And revenue is not projected to start for several more years.

4. ABML is valued at over 600x its assets right now. That's even higher than TSLA. Nuts and not in a good way.

5. Out of every stock on the market right now, ABML is in the top 5 of price to book ratio. LITERALLY INSANE.

6. They are STILL in proof of concept phases. As in, they need to prove their concept works on a larger scale. If it does not they literally go tits up.

7. Their proof of concept factory isn't even finished being built yet.

8. The recent grant they got is just that. A grant. It is NOT revenue. It is used for research and development and is not unusual in the ""green"" world of EVs or Recycling.

9. ABML eval is WORSE than the NKLA eval.

10. It's trading where BILLION DOLLAR companies are trading right now, with almost no assets, only a few million in cash reserves, no revenue expected for years, and not 100% sure the entire process it's built around will be successful.

474,OBLN,"Depends on share size for me.  I try not play anything under $1.50.   But that being said I sell when it hits 20% if it continues run ill buy again.  Difference is I day trade instead of swing trade.  In my opinion 80% of stocks under $2 are pump and dump and should not be buy and hold long term or swing trades.  To much stress and missed opportunities when you are left holding bags.

Example:  yesterday I bought 500 shares @ $2.90 of OBLN.  I held for an hour stressing then sold @ $4.15.  Did I miss out when it ran to $9. Nope.  My goal is $500 a day and I hit it in an hour.

496,DD,"Why did you buy in the first place? I don't mean that in a snarky way. In my opinion it's important to do some DD before buying and come up with a working strategy with how you expect to proceed. 

My #1 rule is I won't invest in anything I'm not willing to hold long term. It takes a lot of the guesswork and fear of volatility out of the picture.

I'm personally not selling. If anything I'll buy dips. This has ridiculous tailwinds pushing this entire industry (mining and recycling) forward faster than a Nikola rig rolling downhill.",0.073,0.908,0.018,-0.6597

498,DD,"OP big picture 2 minute DD. 

Clickstream is looking to be a parent company for multiple apps/media entities. r/pennystocks has a bad taste in their mouth because they botched their very first app launch (WinQuik) and the stock didn't moon like everyone was expecting. that caused a massive sell-off almost down to. 01.

Since then CLIS has revealed they have zero debt, have acquired another app (HeyPal) that they are adapting all their lessons learned from WinQuik to, as well as the option to purchase nearly all of VegasWinners (WNRS, not making this shit up) at an incredibly small fraction of the cost.

Additionally, CLIS has enough cash reserves that they have authorized $1mil to buy back shares, which they have not executed yet. 

Finally, they're actively working to uplist through the OTC ranks and have recently had their penny stock status removed from OTC (bullish).

Id have to go run the math again but depending on the day to day share price of WNRS the assets alone of CLIS should put the share price between .10-.20, it's incredibly undervalued. 

was i disappointed that the rocket launch didn't happen in August? hell yeah i was. but this is a penny that I and many others are long on.",0.097,0.835,0.068,-0.8547
