 I wonder if there's a sub exclusively and explicitly for pump and dump schemes. Maybe all the scammers could go there instead and plan their schemes there. Kind of like r/wallstreetbets where everyone puts money into GameStop for no fucking reason, inflating the stock and making everyone money.

BNGO, Bionano Genomics, have now a Market Cap of $1.9B. A company that just in December was valued around $50M. And they pumped up to $1.9B in a matter of weeks. A company that doesnt have any meaningful income ($7M in 2020), debt ($19.5M in 2020) that overgrow their income.

Yet they pumped over some news in December.

Atossa on the other hand have a Market Cap of just $90M. They have over $60M in cash, and with the warrants waiting to be sold, they will have probably close to $100M. Liabilities is only at $1.5M.

For instance, infections that are “aerosol transmission” aka airborne transmission require isolation rooms with negative pressure and filtrate respirators like N95. Other “droplet” bugs like bordetella, influenza or paramyxovirus only require surgical masks because they are not “aerosol”.

Notice the graphics for contact precautions doesn’t say aerosol anywhere, it says airborne.

I am intimately familiar with the brewing/distilling world and the market for brewing/distilling equipment is already oversaturated. I can throw a dart with a blindfold and hit producers in England, Canada, Scotland, Norway, the Netherlands. Many distillers are even getting equipment from China... and it's actually not bad equipment. 

Meanwhile, the cannabis extraction market is well known to be oversaturated too. Worse yet, biosynthetic CBDs and THC are going to severely disrupt this market.

These stocks are very volatile but my plan is to get in while they are on a huge uptrend for quick gains. I got alerted for ADTX this morning which ended up running almost 120% from open. I got in at $4.05 and out at $4.75 for a quick 17-18% gain. Could I have made alot more? Sure, but I will take 15-20% profits anyday especially in a volatile stock. Another trick is to use a trailing stop loss for it to trigger on dips, but a large dip or halt won't save you. You also need alot of discipline and a plan to get out quick if you go negative or the uptrend is broken.

Personally

I do this

Find stock that has catalyst coming up within 2-3 months.

Next step

Check if that stock has had small run up.

Next step  if yes I buy small position so I don’t miss on potential moon.

Next step if no buy medium sized position.

Continuing Yes

Wait for Dip and buy heavy with plans to sell 2-3 days before News release.

This is my method and I’m up 300% on my penny plays since June.

I’m down a fuck load doing stupid options but I’m really solid at penny following this.

Don’t matter the company or anything. Just if it has news and the stock hasn’t gone nuts yet.

#1 – Grow Solutions Holdings Inc (OTC: GRSO)

Based out of Canada, Grow Solutions is working a different angle in the Cannabis industry. GRSO is developing artificial intelligence that can automatically measure crop health, detect growth patterns, and adjust environmental settings on the fly. 
This is a very interesting OTC play as the technology has potential to revolutionize the market if it is able to yield the results that it hopes for. The legalization in the US will only boost the visibility of a company like this, a huge influx of businesses into Cannabis will create competitors looking for an edge.

If it can find buyers for its other train assets (Asia, Africa, NA, SA) and the assets are valued similarly, we could see several more billion dollars coming down the pipeline for any one of those regions, which would then make Bombardier debt-free entirely.

And at that point, its off to the races as the rest of the train division is sold off.

ABML is massively overvalued. Let me explain:

1. ABML has over 1 million in convertible notes which have been converting every quarter. 

2. ABML has been using offerings to keep up its cash reserves. And its cash reserves are LOW.

3. ABML market cap is over 1 billion now, with ZERO revenue. And revenue is not projected to start for several more years.

4. ABML is valued at over 600x its assets right now. That's even higher than TSLA. Nuts and not in a good way.

5. Out of every stock on the market right now, ABML is in the top 5 of price to book ratio. LITERALLY INSANE.

6. They are STILL in proof of concept phases. As in, they need to prove their concept works on a larger scale. If it does not they literally go tits up.

7. Their proof of concept factory isn't even finished being built yet.

8. The recent grant they got is just that. A grant. It is NOT revenue. It is used for research and development and is not unusual in the ""green"" world of EVs or Recycling.

9. ABML eval is WORSE than the NKLA eval.

10. It's trading where BILLION DOLLAR companies are trading right now, with almost no assets, only a few million in cash reserves, no revenue expected for years, and not 100% sure the entire process it's built around will be successful.

When I looked through it seemed like a great buy because they were also debt free. They have had net losses but they had drastically reduced their expenses so they went from a net loss of $11.3 million in Q32019 to a net loss of $1.8 million in Q32020.

Not to say a mid-term play isn't bad here. With the new vessel, shipping demand increasing, and demand for the goods they ship increasing; there's good reason to hold until their Q4 call.",0.156,0.762,0.082,-0.5719

482,DD,"Why did you buy in the first place? I don't mean that in a snarky way. In my opinion it's important to do some DD before buying and come up with a working strategy with how you expect to proceed. 

My #1 rule is I won't invest in anything I'm not willing to hold long term. It takes a lot of the guesswork and fear of volatility out of the picture.

I'm personally not selling. If anything I'll buy dips. This has ridiculous tailwinds pushing this entire industry (mining and recycling) forward faster than a Nikola rig rolling downhill.",0.073,0.908,0.018,-0.6597

484,DD,"OP big picture 2 minute DD. 

Clickstream is looking to be a parent company for multiple apps/media entities. r/pennystocks has a bad taste in their mouth because they botched their very first app launch (WinQuik) and the stock didn't moon like everyone was expecting. that caused a massive sell-off almost down to. 01.

Since then CLIS has revealed they have zero debt, have acquired another app (HeyPal) that they are adapting all their lessons learned from WinQuik to, as well as the option to purchase nearly all of VegasWinners (WNRS, not making this shit up) at an incredibly small fraction of the cost.

Additionally, CLIS has enough cash reserves that they have authorized $1mil to buy back shares, which they have not executed yet. 

Finally, they're actively working to uplist through the OTC ranks and have recently had their penny stock status removed from OTC (bullish).

Id have to go run the math again but depending on the day to day share price of WNRS the assets alone of CLIS should put the share price between .10-.20, it's incredibly undervalued. 

was i disappointed that the rocket launch didn't happen in August? hell yeah i was. but this is a penny that I and many others are long on.",0.097,0.835,0.068,-0.8547

 As to cyber security, I also like SFET and IWSY (maybe wait for offering dip on that one)
