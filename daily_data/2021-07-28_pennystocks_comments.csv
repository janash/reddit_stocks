2,SPRT," I have been looking alot at FTD lately. There seems to be a high correlation between FTD and prices spikes. The FTD imo indicates a price spike to about 9 ish for SPRT. Most such price strikes will be followed by a ""rug pull"" or reshorting.

Im confident that a Squeeze could occur but the run up to the 9-10 ish price range is not a short squeeze imo.

I have no position in SPRT. I planed on having, but my paycheck came to late.

10,SPRT," Maybe most retailers, but the majority of shares are owned by people who are very in-the-know like Atlas (owners of Greenidge), insiders at Support, major institutions like Vanguard and Blackrock, etc.

A good chunk of these shareholders will be diamond hands because they are obligated to hold. Atlas is going to hold because they want to control as much of the vote on the merger as possible, same with Support insiders. Vanguard likely holds shares as part of the many index funds they manage and therefore do not buy/sell base on profits, but to match the index they are tracking as closely as possible.

This is part of what makes SPRT such an amazing short squeeze opportunity! A huge portion of shareholders can't sell or has no interest in selling for various reasons.",TheMaximumUnicorn,15,/r/pennystocks/comments/osxqqp/sprt_moves_and_impending_sto_liquidation/h6s1fn3/,0.017,0.694,0.29,0.993

True story, when I first entered stock trading, I was literally up 100% on 1 trade, but saw twitter, fintwit pumpers, ihub, all saying ""this thing will be $1 in a few days"" and literally ended up holding and not selling even my investment! Yeah that 100% gain turned in a red trade...

Now I am humble and trying to fight greed, personally any 8-20% gains and I run and reload the dip no matter what any twitter pumper is saying
