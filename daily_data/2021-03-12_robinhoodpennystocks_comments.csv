4,DD," MACD and Klinger interception is looking like their will be a trend reversal for this one. Probably going to be a good next couple of weeks.

It’s got a 1.75 : 1 ratio of increase to decreased positions from institutional investors. The options activity is pretty high with an implied volatility of 225.96% and its historic at 119.46%. The volume is significantly higher for the calls then the puts for a DTE of 7 days and the most popular call being $2.50. The calls to puts vol ratio is 2946 : 136. This one is on my watch list now. Thank you ☝️

Edit: If your interested, I’ll be posting a little bit more DD on this one since I like the stock. I’ll post the link on the next edit.

Edit 2: Did some more DD and I personally think this a good short-term play but high risk as well, so I won't be posting a DD. I don't want to post a stock on here that's too risky.

Edit: this comment sparked some more thought into Zom. I doubled my position in Zom (partially because I averaged down with this) and because apparently end of March is their catalyst as well as whispers of there being an announcement this weekend/Monday and maybe the spike today is insiders who got the info first.

29,WTI," I'm not going to pretend to understand the Brent price factors other than supply and demand....so I'll do my best to explain the small sliver of understanding that I have.

Brent is one of the two benchmark crude markets that drives the ppb of crude - West Texas Intermediate is the other. When Brent and/or WTI futures are going up, the other crude prices go up too.

When I started looking at $EGY, I looked at their last year prices and compared them to the Brent prices. They have both followed a very similar climb as the world has come out of the pandemic (of course, as I type this $EGY is freefalling).

That's my ELI5, but keep in mind that I'm operating on about a 3rd grade level myself, so it's basically an 8yr old explaining to a 5yr old.

Basically, as long as price stays above $1.90 ($6 strike price minus the $4.10 premium that I get) the contract will lose value each day (theta, time decay) eventually expiring worthless.

Contract has already went underwater and I'm up a few percentage points. I will slowly get paid out as the contract value decays eventually cashing out the full $410 premium.

Here's the catch: I'm OBLIGATED to buy the 100 shares at $6 each if my buyer exercises the contract. I still keep my premium so the actual average cost per share would be $1.90 (the breakeven).

If this thing dips to .50 per share and I get assigned I could pay MUCH more than market value for worthless shares. I'd also lose everything on my calls and actual shares as the price drops and time goes by.

165,TA," **Edit to post:**

**Purple is the current trend line needed to reach its lowest estimate.**

**The Grey dotted line represents both a high estimate and a low estimate which can be identified from its position on the graph.**

**Data is a little skewed with the weekly interval on the first image being the 6th of Jan rather than the 1st of Jan but its effect isn't at all significant. I wish I could edit posts but oh well.**

Some info on the first two images:

The first two images are mainly derived by FA (other than the purple trend line) since that's how estimates are obtained. The intersection of EOY (red) and estimate lines (grey & green) are simply the timeline where the stock is predicted to be within the year. I use the lowest point to connect the intersection because that helps scale the trend line for me. The third picture is my own TA but you can ignore it, to me it's just signaling a *potentially* good week.

For the TA (if interested):

To give you an oversimplified version:

\- Top Graph (w/candles): You’re looking for the interception when the white intercepts red downwards.

\- For the rest of the graphs but the last: Looking for the interception when white crosses red upwards.

\- For the last graph: Purple intercepting yellow upwards.

Disclaimer: Although indicators are typically used for the prediction of the future price, it’s not always correct. It can sometimes just idle at a certain level and not reach newer heights for a while, or even go in the opposite direction from where it looks like it’s heading and reach lower lows.

Here is more info that I put into docs. I also added hyperlinks if you want to read more about it. I tried to just extract what I thought was the most important part.

203,SOS," I got scared with all the rumors that SOS was a bogus shell company.  I sold at $7.50 for small profits.

207,SOS," It might take a while to see big profits, as it's getting shorted left and right, but it will take off once it gets back to the volume it got in mid February.

Of course, at this point, I think the only way to get that volume is for the shorts to give up or for SOS to release either an earnings report or a report of what they've mined in the last *x* weeks. The rebuttal of the short report and the videos of the mining rigs in operation have only taken it this far, and the shorts have their half dozen law firms vomiting press releases every day reiterating that they want investors to contact them for class action lawsuits.

I'm all in, but it's a small position, six $30 1/21/22 calls and ten shares. If it gets to $16 by the end of April, I'll have about a 300% return.",badger0511,1,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/m3o59w/100_bucks_to_spend/gqq2fbj/,0.012,0.947,0.041,0.5106

210,SOS," I enjoy watching the bears on there. It's like clockwork... they show up at morning dips, market wide algo sell-offs, and day trader sell-offs and act like it's the start of SOS' slide to $0. Then they vanish the moment SOS goes up 5 cents.",badger0511,1,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/m3o59w/100_bucks_to_spend/gqq4ev4/,0.0,0.83,0.17,0.802
211,ALL, If you’re relatively new to trading I’d stick with just stocks and hold off on options until you get a better feel of how stocks function. There’s a potential for bigger gains but also a potential for losing ALL of your money with options. I’ve been trading for a couple of years and I still don’t feel like I should be trading options because of the level of risk that comes with it. When I’m doing some DD/research I’ll typically use the ratio of calls and puts to scale my picks for trading stocks. I still won’t buy options even when the ratio is significantly higher because anything can happen with stocks.,g1sp4rky,3,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/m3j9hn/does_anyone_know_why_im_losing_money_i_made_the/gqp34kp/,0.054,0.885,0.061,-0.0387

213,HUGE, I'm gonna sell half around peak tomorrow and holding half forever. This is the holy grail of an investment. This will buy me a lambo in 2 years. Metamaterials is gonna be HUGE,itsrohyo,10,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/m32ezo/trch_buy_hodl_or_sell/gqmo58r/,0.0,0.908,0.092,0.4648
214,TRCH," If you are day trading sell.  If you have faith that they will sell their assets for a good amount, then hold.  The merger with meta materials is being voted on by meta tomorrow.  If they say yes, torchlight sells their assets.  TRCH holders get 25% (edit: I was incorrect!  TRCH keeps share number in new company but meta holders get 3x apparently!) of their shares converted to Meta plus a special dividend of the asset sale.  Value of asset sale has been speculated anywhere from $1 to $15 per share.  My guess is closer to the $1-$5 range.",Lantore,7,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/m32ezo/trch_buy_hodl_or_sell/gqmtm7n/,0.0,0.731,0.269,0.9763

216,TRCH, Arent TRCH holders gonna get 1 and MMATF holders 3 shares after the merger? Or did i get it completely wrong? I thought TRCH just holds 25% of the total shares after the merger.,Soldado63,1,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/m32ezo/trch_buy_hodl_or_sell/gqmvdjx/,0.097,0.768,0.135,0.0943
217,TRCH, Yeah. I don’t know what OP is on about. It’s current price has nothing to do with TRCH. It’s all about the up coming merger. Sounds like they just went to TRCH’s website and copy/paste random stuff.

218,TRCH, I’ve heard conflicting information on this. My understanding is that each TRCH share is converting to the new company no problem. Meta holders will be getting 3 shares for every 1 TRCH outstanding. The special dividend is compensation for the reduced holdings post-merger and the drop from the fact that there will be several hundred million more shares on the market.,RedMiah,3,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/m32ezo/trch_buy_hodl_or_sell/gqn0ioq/,0.133,0.685,0.182,0.5574
