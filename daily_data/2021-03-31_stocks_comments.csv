0,GS," I'm poor, but work overtime and invest ~75% income.  Let me tell you- poverty is dangerous, dirty, smelly and cold.  There are real life consequences to theft and impoverishment.  People die from poor conditions, food, stress, lack of healthcare, inducement to addiction, unsafe neighborhoods...

So white collar criminals should be charged criminally for effects, besides restitution and theft charges.  **Defrauding pensions will statistically lead to early deaths from poverty, stress, violence from relocation to insecure neighborhoods, suicides.**  There will be rapes from plunging people into poverty.  

GS fraudulently rated their MBS as ultrasafe and AAA then shorted them for gargantuan returns.

I think these fucks, for defrauding hundreds of millions, should be scheduled **sentencing guidelines equivalent to tens of thousands of manslaughters,** rapes, and murders.  So lets say **1 million years in Rikers.**

But in the interest of trying to keep this somewhat on topic, it would be valid for GS to state that they’re not a fiduciary and don’t have to have their clients’ best interests in mind.

So I completely agree that your long-term portfolio needs exposure to multiple factors and not such growth/single industry. You can play around with allocation to various factors even if a factor (eg. value) hasn't had great performance relative to others over the last decade.

102,BB, I don't know what people were expecting. The bear argument (at least for the next few years) was always that BB simply does not generate significant revenue. They sell low-price annual subscriptions that businesses are happy to have but there is no premium product or scalable per-usage model that they can then push onto those businesses. Monetization of EV data is supposed to be their big play to fill that gap but it will not come for years. Institutional investors have to consider the opportunity cost of parking money in BB and having to wait 3 or 4 years on marginal or no returns before BB would theoretically explode.,PeliPal,139,/r/stocks/comments/mgqauw/blackberry_reports_fourth_quarter_and_full_fiscal/gsukudq/,0.074,0.848,0.078,0.362

106,BB," Scrolling through the comments. Absolutely none of you is talking about their ongoing sale of part of the patent portfolio of mobile devices, messaging and wireless networking. 

The Company has limited its patent monetization activities due to the ongoing negotiations. If the Company had not been in negotiations during the quarter, we believe that Licensing revenue would have been higher.

Also looks like none of you listened to the conf call in which CEO said it would bring an one-off big payment +7 years royalties. I’m not going to bother talking about him saying no dilution in sight.

Let’s also ignore their $800m in cash (15% of their market cap). Need not to mention that now 23 out of 25 EV OEMs are working with BB now (up from 19 past quarter).

Just be fed the narrative and continuing on not digging further.

Be exercised. Also it’s best to sell a covered call while the stock is on an upward trend because the premiums will be in your favor and you can make more money. Generally it best to sell covered calls above your cost basis, but it’s up to the individual. Not financial advice, just opinion. Each 100 shares is a contract, so you could easily sell 5 contracts to recoup some cost while saving your other shares from being assigned. Like I said today I sold one contract for $21 total.

180,BB," If you own 100 shares of a company you can sell a ‘covered call’  what this means  you are selling an option contract (each contract is 100 shares)  you can sell this contract for a premium. Just like you can buy a call option, you can sell them as well (would only recommend selling them if you own shares)
A weekly means that I am selling my covered call each week, so the option contract I’m selling expires by the end of the week. 
For instance I have 100 shares of BB, I sold a covered call for BB at a strike price of $11 today, the premium was .21 per share (times 100 shares) equals $21

What this means is that I automatically get the $21 for selling my contract (covered call, and an obligation to sell my shares at $11 if the call gets exercised)  I have to hold onto those 100 shares through this week. If the price of the stock goes to $11 I can be ‘assigned’ meaning that I am obligated to sell my 100 shares at $11 (so $1100) plus I get to keep the premium from the contract ($21)

I had a cost basis of $11.05 per share. The first contract was an $11 dollar call, which sold for $10 or .10 per share. That knocked my average down to $10.95, so if the contract executed, I would net 5 bucks.

I followed a similar strategy this week, but was worried about a bump in stock due to earnings (lol), so I did a $12 call for $15. If it executed, I would have received a small profit of ~$120 and completely erased my BB losses.

I'm not sure what this is going to look like next week after this drop in prices.

212,BLNK," Out of interest when would you buy puts? 

For me I think BLNK is a prime target if what OP said is true, and the guy at the top is just pump and dumping this company to make a buck, eventually that will catch up. But my hesitations would be;

The EV market is the 'in vogue' market of today. It's where everyone sees our future and to an extent good news in the EV market rises all ships. My concern would be that investors simply won't take this view (OP) until it's too late; aka I think the ability to pick the right strike date (think that's the right term?) Is pretty much 0. 

I could get behind shorting. Because then you don't have a time limit, and I think that ties in better with what OP suggests is the problem (the helmsmen). As you can short believing this company will eventually fail/will at somepoint stop being overvalued. Whereas with the puts the expiry is going to be all or nothing. 

I suppose what I am actually trying to ask is;
Why or would you use puts instead of shorts? Other than for the additional gains?
For this stock in particular would you buy puts this far out? Or is this one for the back burner until an opportunity arises?

215,GME," You don't. Shorting a stock is when you lend out shares at the current market price hoping the stock price falls. You then recall the shares at the lower price and profit from the difference.

216,VERY," The date is called an expiry date. The price the option states is the strike price (example, a $25 4/16 Call).

I would buy Puts instead of Shorts because the maximum loss on a Put is the Premium price I paid for the option. So if a few contracts cost me $500, and expire worthless, I lose my $500. That's it. With shorts, if it for some reason rockets your losses are infinite, as the price can go higher, higher, higher, and you eventually have to pay those shares back that you have borrowed. Shorts are VERY sketch and I wouldn't ever buy them (you probably can't anyways) unless you were absolutely sure of something.

Personally I haven't bought any yet because the stock is up like 9% today, so clearly the market either doesn't agree with OP's sentiment, or it's a delayed reaction.

220,GME," Ask anyone that shorted GME how they're feeling.

Buying puts involves a lot of additional premium and shorting shares has the risk of getting margin called.

221,BLNK," Hey thanks, great breakdown. I see what your saying, the shorts have unlimited risk and the puts don't. I don't know why but I had assumed the puts had a similar risk. You either are in the money or you aren't and you can let them expire worthless; so like you said you just end up paying out the cost you paid for the option. 

I will definitely do a little digging then. As I'm usually a learn by doing guy. I have created a collection of charts watching the EV names. I think until they break synchronisation and the OPs sentiment is more broadly known, it's too risky. I personally was in one of these sorts of stocks; canntrust. Thing was in lock step until the news broke, but even then it was still quite a delayed reaction before it started to tank. So I will keep my eye on BLNK and maybe in the future il dabble.

248,BB," people chase rockets that go BRR. then get anxious when their money is tied up into stock that dips or goes sideways for more than a month. ""oh no, I am missing out"".. 

When I look at my investments, I see one pattermn: whenever I held , I came out on top. not with 150% returns, but I made positive returns on all of them. 

whenever I got anxious and lost my cool, I lost money.   
whenever I chased hype and had FOMO, I lost money. 

I usually do my own DD on whatever I buy. I look at fundamentals and ask the following questions:

1. did their business model work for Y amount of time ? (this should show if they are actually making money )- numbers don´t lie and if the company is in a downward trend, then usually something is wrong. and I am not alking about covid dips or 2008 drops.

272,NOK," Because my leaps are ITM and almost two years out so the theta decay is very minimal. My thought process is this:

$3 Calls at a cost basis of $1.50, to break even NOK has to be at a $4.50 stock price in two years, a 12% increase. I believe this is a safe bet, I think it would be difficult to not achieve this.

IF: NOK hits $5/share by call expiration  
THEN: $3 call option would be worth $2 (33% gain when purchased for $1.50)  
AND: Shares purchased at $3.95 would net a 27% gain

IF: NOK hits $6/share by call expiration  
THEN: $3 call option would be worth $3 (100% gain when purchased for $1.50)  
AND: Shares purchased at $3.95 would net a 52% gain

IF: NOK hits $8/share by call expiration  
THEN: $3 call option would be worth $5 (233% gain when purchased for $1.50)  
AND: Shares purchased at $3.95 would net a 103% gain

&#x200B;

**Basically, I am so confident that this will go up in price in 2 years that I am willing to take a bit of extra risk for the greater upside of calls**

&#x200B;

If you're interested in math, this equations tells me at exactly what price it pays off to buy LEAPS instead of shares:

x/3.95 = (x-3)/1.5       where x = share price

this solves to x = 4.84

If you don't trust the stock enough to put all of your bet into it at once, then when it drops it's justifying your fear, but then instead of closing your position and finding something else, you just double down on the amount of money you put into it, hoping that the law of averages will move it back to the original price, and pay back more than you lost already.

The negative side of that strategy is if it goes up you've only got half your money in it and you're only making half the profit that you intended to make by investing in it. Which means that you're losing no matter which direction it starts.

>Having money stuck on a trade moving sideways for 12 months is worse than taking the loss and putting it elsewhere in my opinion.

OP is one of those guys who sold out a great company like Amazon at $3,000 because it hasn't moved for the past 9 months. Nothing has changed about the company's fundamentals but you sold to buy another stock because of ""opportunity costs,"" hoping to re-enter at a lower price on some other time. Who knows if the new trade is even a good idea. Then at some point the ""reflation trade"" stops working, people want Amazon stock again. As you watch the stock keeps moving higher, eventually you couldn't help yourself and hop back in when it goes to $4,000, buying at new ATH.

Hell no - as you said, it’s got quite a few fuck ups on it’s balance sheet.

319,UI," Apple is already 5+ years too late to enter the market to crush Tesla. There's a reason people have been calling Tesla the Apple of the car industry for years. Tesla literally already does everything unique Apple does with their smartphones, but in the auto market, including:

* Reputation for being great at making a very intuitive UI that's much better then the competition and much easier to use? Check.

* Has their own unique approach to things that goes against the grain? See their self driving methodology. Check.

* Pioneered new innovations in a stale industry that others are now rushing to copy? See over the air software updates, auto-pilot, etc. Check.

* Charges a premium for their product, and has lots of people willing to pay for it? Check.

* Has a rapid fan base that absolutely loves their products and gives them billions of dollars worth of free advertising in social media? Check.

imo Apple is going to fail horribly if they make an EV, because Tesla already offers everything unique Apple could, and already established themselves as the market leader in premium EVs.

As an Apple shareholder I think Apple would be much better off getting their self driving functionality to work and then selling it is to the other automakers imo. Given how most of the legacy automakers have reputations for being absolutely dreadful at writing good software I highly doubt most of them are ever going to get a Level 4 or 5 self driving car to work on their own, so I'm sure they'd be willing to pay Apple a premium to use their self driving software/hardware in their vehicles.",ShadowLiberal,-5,/r/stocks/comments/mh7wo9/ubs_upgrades_aapl_to_buy_raises_price_target_on/gsxgoj1/,0.079,0.789,0.131,0.9637

The business model they’ve applied to their current product ecosystem does not work for automobiles. It’s not my fault it’s their business model. 

Insurance companies would literally not insure. Oh, you need a charging dongle? That’s $2,000. Oh, your windshield cracked? That’s $2,000. Oh, your screen stopped working? Well need to replace the entire drive unit for $25,000. 

It won’t work.

“They won’t do that”. Why not? It’s 100% of their current products. 

An apple automobile division will likely not become a cash cow like its current device lineup.

323,AAPL," Right, but what that suggests is that the market is extremely optimistic at this point. And we know that, based on all the soaring indices and low interest rates and bailouts. Based on the last 12 years of the stock performance and how investors valued it, the company doubling in size is currently priced into the stock.

The last time AAPL was at this PE ratio was in 2007. From 2007 to 2009 it lost 50% of its share price despite good growth as a company. That's the warning. In an optimistic market, $140 might be a price target. But in a market we've all seen from 2008-2019, the price target is closer to $80.

All I can say is spend time searching the Roku DD threads on this sub of this year, and read as much of their news on finviz or Think or Swim as you can from the last 6 months.

If you don't like Roku, you probably think they are just some debt ridden gimmick. Check Yahoo finance, and check how strong the bearish argument really is against them. All I can think of to play devil's advocate is the argument that ""people are going outside again,"" which is ridiculous considering cable cutting is projected to increase YoY and they are locking up that entertainment and more importantly advertisement business of streaming.",suphater,6,/r/stocks/comments/mh2dlx/rstocks_daily_discussion_wednesday_mar_31_2021/gswitjn/,0.104,0.803,0.093,0.144

379,ADP," **Daily Stock Market Forecast**

Major market movers today:

**Biden will present his infrastructure plan after market close**

CNBC is [freaking out](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/30/wall-street-awaits-biden-infrastructure-plan-but-it-may-not-be-ready-for-the-new-taxes.html) about this and acting like the market is going to get terrified by his tax plan, but that doesn't really make any sense because everybody already knows his tax plan.

I expect the market to be trepidatious but filled with wild swings today as people start hedging their bets before he speaks.

**The ADP Employment Report is mixed**

Federal employment data comes out on Friday and is expected to significantly move the market. The [ADP Employment Report](https://adpemploymentreport.com/2021/March/NER/NER-March-2021.aspx), which came out today, is sort of like a sneak preview of what it's going to say.

The report looks bad to me, but, so far, the media and the market are reacting like it's great news. Employment growth did not meet expectations, and, in tech, dropped significantly -- but  [Fox](https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/adp-report-shows-biggest-job-gains-since-september), [Reuters](https://financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/u-s-private-payrolls-increase-in-march-adp), and [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/31/adp-private-payrolls-march-2021.html) are all writing bullish reports on it and NASDAQ futures are going up faster than the Dow or the S&P 500.

So, I don't know. I guess missing expectations is a good thing now.

I'm not going to question it.

Today, I'm forecasting a **green day** with a NASDAQ high of ~~13,161~~ 13,288 and a low of ~~12,945~~ 13,161.

~~It looks like we're going to open pretty close to 13,161, though, so expect the market to go down shortly after it opens.~~

445,DD," Hoo boy.  You can, and there's a potential for huge gains, but like u/MAMark1 said, it's super volatile and much higher risk than listed stocks.

You really have to do your DD, and even some of the ""good"" penny stock companies will be sketchy.  The bad ones will basically just be shell companies that people shill for pump+dumps.  There are lots of shills in the OTC arena looking to pump stocks beyond their ""fair"" value (if you can even say a penny stock has one), as well as bashers looking to scare investors out.  It's like the scene with a certain gaming retailer's stock, but all the time, for basically any OTC that moves.

But, if you're OK with watching your account value fluctuate wildly, it's even possible to be a successful long-term investor (although short term plays are probably smarter), and if you get in on the ground floor with a company that manages to claw its way out of OTC purgatory, you can make huge returns that you'd never see holding shares of listed companies.

I'd liken it more to playing options trades than investing in shares in terms of risk levels.

504,IBM," Not all dividend stocks are created equal. Such as General Electric who dropped their dividend to I believe 1 cent. Look for companies with at least a 25 year history of paying and increasing dividends that’s why they are called the aristocrats. Coke, IBM , Proctor and Gamble come to mind. They are not exciting stocks their price doesn’t move to much historically. However when you buy the stock have the dividends reinvested than over time you see the magic  of compounding interest. There is an legend that Albert Einstein said compounding interest was the most powerful force in the universe. Not sure I believe it’s an actual quote , but it does get the message across. Not investment advice. Good luck.

>Ford’s stock saw its worst trading day on November 19, 2008. The stock fell -33.33% after reports were released that suggested a possible bankruptcy of General Motors Liquid error: internal. At the time, Ford was trading at less than $2.00 a share. Despite the fall, just a few days later, Ford saw its best trading day ever.

Averaging down is more of a strategy aimed at lowering your breakeven price. Aka; how far back up it has to move % for you to be out of the red. If your example was the opposite way around, and you bought at 600, it drops to 400 you buy again, now your average is 500. So the SP only needs a 25% move for you to breakeven instead of a 50%. The catch is the added risk of it continuing to go down and you having put more money in.

They could likely postpone further openings.

They made the bold statement that as soon as restrictions go away, they will stay away. If numbers go up, chances are, they're not gonna take the risk and open more just yet.

The political narrative suggests they're playing with the thought of pulling off New Zealand or Australia entry restrictions, as they're so far ahead in the vaccination process and shit scared of a new mutation.

Also, AZ is taking massive hits in reputation.

>UK is not set to have a 3rd wave. That's why Britain is ending lockdown within the next 2 weeks, and France is just about to enter a more extreme lockdown

It is, the UK government has already been putting spin on it by talking about not being able to do anything about a 3rd wave washing up on their shores from the EU. What are you basing your claim on?

>52% of UK population have had first vaccine, compared to EU average of 11%

and the 12 week period is almost up, without a second vaccination the first shots are going to diminish effectiveness, the UK is facing a shortage of vaccines as they were importing many from the EU and the raw materials to manufacture them are being cut off by India. They won't be able to give second shots to most during the save window to do so.

&#x200B;

>54.7% of UK have antibodies (herd immunity)

The antibodies will be gone, they don't last without a second shot, there won't be any largescale herd immunity, the UK will face a 3rd wave, another lockdown and also risks creating vaccine-resistant variants as a result.

&#x200B;

I don't think you understand how utterly stupid the UK government actually is, they are treating the entire pandemic as a money-making/tabloid spin/vote-winning campaign. Half of the vaccines UK citizens have received were from the EU and exported to the UK, that's now ending, The Government is dragging the country into a ditch and them claiming to have saved them from said ditch.

583,UK," While you're right about the vaccines, your equation is missing that the EU's third wave is mostly driven from the opposite side of the demographic.

Meaning children. We opened our schools and the infection rate in children age 0-9-15 is as high as it previously was on the opposite end of the spectrum.  
The difference is, that the kids get infected and carry the virus to their families who aren't vaccinated. This shows by the significant increase of infection numbers in the ages of 25-45, which is parent age.   


Now, these age groups aren't vaccinated in the UK either and they are to wait for at least a month during the shortage of supply.

Every time you get a distribution, it's basically reducing the cost basis of your unit (share), which you don't have to technically pay for until you realize the profit by selling the share.  The K-1 keeps track of how much of your distribution is capital gains, and how much of it is income (if you've held long enough to reduce your cost basis to $0).

660,DTE," > why wouldn't I sell a put deep ITM like strike 190 @67

You can certainly do this. However, you would probably would be waiting, and sitting on 19k in cash, until close to expiration when the stock will (probably) be assigned to you.  

If the stock moves against you, you'll still be paying 190 dollars a share. If the stock moves in your direction, and the option price falls, you'd be able to buy to close the position and keep the remaining premium. 

The risk is that you'll be sitting on 19,000 dollars in cash that could be doing something else while you wait for the contract to get close to expiry and the stock to be assigned to or for it to be profitable for you to buy back your option and close the position.

> The premium I receive ($6,700) would far exceed any short-term losses

This isn't correct. The intrinsic value of the contract you would sell is about 67 dollars. The extrinsic value of the contract is effectively 0 (no one expects apple to trade at 190). The share price is about 123. You'll collect the 6700 when you sell the option, but you are still obligated to buy the shares at 190. If the shares fall to 120, you are still out 3 dollars a share even considering the premium you received for the contract. If the shares fall more, you lose more. 

A more common way to make this trade would be to sell something closer to the money. Selling a put at 120 at 51 DTE, nets you 430 in premium. If it is assigned, great, you wanted to shares anyway, if not then you made ~3.75% on your 12k in 51 days. Selling at 125 makes it more like that you will be assigned, and you'd collect 6.75 in premium for your trouble.",fish60,4,/r/stocks/comments/mh6uu9/what_am_i_missing/gsx3zit/,0.037,0.851,0.112,0.9669

Further out, you are taking more risk, but that risk is basically the same as buying the shares outright.

> maximizing profit in the shortest amount of time selling puts

If you want to buy the shares anyway, selling ATM or slightly OTM is probably a better move because those contracts have extrinsic value.

665,AAPL," No.

If you sell the contract, you get the 6700 dollars no matter what. It is yours. However, you still have to buy the shares at 190. You bought the shares for 190, but your cost basis is the current price because of the premium you received for the contract.

You don't get to sell the contract for 6700 and buy the shares for the current price. But, effectively, by selling a contract this far ITM, you have bought the shares at the current price.

You can measure this with the delta of the option. Delta measures the effect of the underlying moving 1 dollar on the price of the option. 

As an example, the delta on AAPL210416P190 is -1. This means that if AAPL goes 1 dollar higher, that contract will be worth 1 dollar less (and you could buy it back cheaper than you sold it for!). In general, the further ITM a put option is the closer the delta will be to -1.

734,IT," Live in a rural area in the northern Midwest. House values are increasing, but not as quickly as I would have expected especially given the location. 

Pretty much every business I know of is hiring people and a lot of them have shortages of employees right now, especially the local government agencies. I live in a town of about 10,000 but we're the largest one in a 60 mile radius so all the big retailers, chains, etc in the area are here. I think Wendy's is starting people at like $14.25 an hour or something. This would have been taken as some kind of prank 2 years ago if I saw it in an advertisement.


The town I live in is the type of place where there's a lot of rich people with houses, but they stay empty for half the year. There's also a much higher proportion of seniors than average. It's a solidly conservative place, although lately support for environmental protections and concern about climate change has increased substantially. And given the political makeup of the area, it was already higher than one would probably expect. I'm mostly basing this off of the number of people I see recycling things, the number of businesses advertising some sort of green initiative, the local government's adoption of free recycling and composting programs, and the general chatter I hear about how this winter has been so much warmer than normal that people are worried about the future. But my conclusion is essentially that pretty much everyone thinks climate change is real and most of them are wanting the government to do something big to address it.

 I used to work at an inpatient addiction treatment facility, and the people I know that still work there are telling me that significantly fewer clients are coming in for treatment. It used to be full all the time with a 3-month waiting list, now there's a few extra beds on any given day. That could, of course, be a result of fewer people seeking treatment due to covid. However, I also have a lot of friends who are former drug addicts or some who are currently struggling with their use, and they've told me that a lot of people got clean over the pandemic. Or at least towards the end of it. Apparently supply was very difficult to get and the stimulus, and unemployment money from the government allowed addicts to actually pay for their own housing and stabilize their lives enough to get jobs. The ones who chose to spend their stimulus money in a different way have mostly ended up overdosing or getting arrested, by the sound of it (not due to fraud, just excessive drug use and resulting consequences).

I run a technology consulting business. We help small and mid size (relative to the area) businesses figure out if they could benefit by incorporating any form of blockchain technology into their operations. I started it about 3 years ago, just as a side project without much work ever put in. Over the past 6 months or so, when I'd nearly forgotten about the business entirely, we've been getting more requests for an initial consult (we offer them free) every week than I had over the first two years the business existed. I've been having to tell potential clients that it would be months before I can even start a thorough review of their business's possible benefit. I've also just been responding to certain businesses with an immediate no, based on what they do. It seems like every business owner in the area is under the impression that they can somehow massively reduce costs with blockchain. Not that some of them can't benefit, sometimes substantially, but it's not going to seriously help most small businesses save money with what's currently available. I try to make this clear to people who contact me but many of them still insist that they need to ""have blockchain"", usually when they're updating/repairing/establishing their networking systems and IT hardware.

736,IRS," The terminology of options makes this confusing.  Think of it this way: if you OPEN a position, then CLOSE that position for a loss, then OPEN the same position within 30 days, that’s a wash sale.

E.g. buy a stock (OPEN position), sell the stock (CLOSE position) to realize a loss, buy back same stock (OPEN position) within 30 days of your sale for new cost basis.  You are now in violation.

E.g. sell a put (OPEN position), buy back put (CLOSE position), sell same put (re-OPEN position).

However, I believe there is a gray area where this pertains to losses on options, not sure how it works in IRS regulations (I am not a tax professional).  To be safe, probably advisable to avoid any trading pattern which fits the description of a wash sale.

738,PS," I subscribed to Motley Fool's SA and RB. I'm not paid by them and have nothing to do with them, except that I'm a relatively new customer.Cons:- when you subscribe, you have to explain to everyone who knows them that you are NOT paying for their crappy junk free articles; in my eyes, they are hurting their business so much by producing this free garbage- many (but not all) recommended stocks seem like obvious picks (such as, buy Amazon)- they start selling you on MORE services for even CRAZIER returns, and they use outdated, annoying, pathetic marketing. (Motley people, if you are reading this, you really REALLY need a new marketing team. The crap you put out now is embarrassing. ""ONLY TODAY you can click here for our 100009990000% returning stock advice for only 1800 dollars but discounted to 1300..."" Cringe-worthy.)

Pros:- DDs on premium (paid) services are all decent; there are pros, cons for a stock; everything you need to know in a short readable article- I have never heard about some of the recommended stocks that seem to be good stocks (I'm a newish subscriber, so I don't know what happens in 3-5 years, which they recommend for holding)- It makes you buy the stock that you KNEW was a good stock, but for some reason didn't buy before because it is too obvious - for example, they tell you: ""we think that these 5 stocks are a good buying opportunity now"" - and then I finally DO buy a stock like Amazon or Paypal (which I believed to be good stocks anyway). This is more psychological/behavioral, but for some stocks I need the nudge to actually buy them.

\- I have fun waiting for new stock recommendations every week, and I make it a goal to save for and buy one of the recommended stock each time, so I invest every week.

See: Citadel, Melvin Capitol, Archegos, Nomura, and Credit Suisse, just to name a few. Youll be able to throw darts at stocks and still make money at that point. 

Option 4. OnlyFans is hiring.

Christian Henry is the new CEO of PACB since august 2020 and worked more than 20 years in life science industry. He worked as an executive at Illumina for 12 years, the biggest competition for PACBIO. He understands how he needs to work with growing companies and also knows how important it is to expand, how important marketing is and he knows how to negotiate. You might think that thats normal for a CEO but in my expierence this is not the case at all.

What I also like about the management is that they understand that if you are listed on the stockmarket, you have to make changes. Its very easy to see their numbers, their reports are good to read, their presentations and events are public and most important for me: Their incredibly difficult products are pretty easy to follow.

I learned SO many things from their presentations and Q&A's.

This might be expected from a company who is listed on the stock market but still. Its nice.

About their product i didnt include the difference between long and short sequencing. Because i have not written it down anywhere yet and also because i cant tell the entire story. But in short:

The short read sequencing is not able to read full range of genetic variations, while the long read is able to find singe base and structural varations. This means basicly that the discovery of genes that cause disease could be easier found.

So not only has PACBIO long read sequencing and their biggest competitor short sequencing, PACBIO also has HI-FI sequencing. Which is more efficiënt and more accurate than the existing long sequencing.

The only down side is that obviously competitors are also evolving, and before PacBio can make big profits, there is already a new sequencing product that is better than the flagship product PacBio has right now.",Caranthiir,3,/r/stocks/comments/mhcka8/pacific_biosciences_of_california_pacb_dd/gsy1wpl/,0.01,0.844,0.145,0.9927

866,GDP," Nah we're good. The Fed is letting the interest rates creep up, GDP is improving, and the unemployment rate is improving. 

The Fed uses the interest rates to control inflation and unemployment. It may freak people out a little (and subsequently the markets) to see inflation increase, but it's actually putting people back to work. There's a tradeoff between inflation and unemployment that most people don't understand. Look up the Phillips Curve if you're curious. 

That doesn't mean we won't have a bumpy road ahead though. Biden is coming out with an aggressive infrastructure bill and it's unclear where the financing will come from specifically. Additionally, it will also serve as a jobs program, but estimates of its impacts to GDP from the CBO remain to be seen. We'll just have to wait for their cost benefit analysis once a bill is actually on the table. 

With all that said, I've been seeing an increase in technical analyses predicting a major pullback. The Skew index is also through the roof. So while I'm not worried about stagflation specifically, I think there may be an event coming. No clue when, but it's pretty obvious we're in a stock market bubble. It could pop in a week or a year and who knows what will trigger it. 

It's also fair to note that I've been liquidating a lot of my random positions and rolling them into more stable stuff (and sitting on cash). I've been trading a lot of short term options as well. It's just my particular strategy and I might be being overly cautious. But I'd rather be safe than sorry.

947,AMD," Many of the semiconductor stocks might dip, even though growth will remain high, because a lot of people misunderstood the shortage, and failed to consider that shortage wasn't a windfall, it was hurting margins and making future market share potentially more fluid.

And at the start of it, people were still saying it was a given that the US wouldn't re-enter this sector. People forgot the US government is a big enough (indirect) customer that they can indeed cause companies to build US fabs just via their own purchasing, and just by telegraphing that intent. So there are lots of new fabs getting built, there is going to be a lot of disruption in this sector, and anybody who lags will get punished.

Plus, in my opinion as a firmware engineer, we're on the verge of additional disruption with lots of new RISC-V microcontrollers and processors in the pipelines. This has the potential to further disrupt market share as it competes with ARM processors, and is cheaper and equally powerful platform for many of the new mixed-function ICs that are being developed. This will be good for the sector, but maybe not for the current leaders. I think TXN is going to hold their market share better than many other ARM vendors, because they have a bunch of US fabs already, but so does everybody else, and they're already trading at a premium.

So there are lots of new fabs getting built, there is going to be a lot of disruption in this sector, and anybody who lags will get punished.

Plus, in my opinion as a firmware engineer, we're on the verge of additional disruption with lots of new RISC-V microcontrollers and processors in the pipelines. This has the potential to further disrupt market share as it competes with ARM processors, and is cheaper and equally powerful platform for many of the new mixed-function ICs that are being developed. This will be good for the sector, but maybe not for the current leaders. I think TXN is going to hold their market share better than many other ARM vendors, because they have a bunch of US fabs already, but so does everybody else, and they're already trading at a premium.

For example, AMD are fabless so for them the chips themselves are just cost of revenue.

957,GDP," They’re one of the largest players affecting our GDP for obvious reasons: Planes aren’t cheap. They LIKELY will not have issues with semiconductor shortages (planes are giant computers nowadays) because aviation regulation is so slow, they’ve likely bought a 50 year supply of 2005-era CPU’s for today’s production.This is what they did with the 777 during its production. They bought enough processors to last half a century and the tech was already outdated. 

Another plane crash of significant caliber would likely damage Boeing a lot, but again, I’ve been in aviation for 20+ years and we all know the best time to buy airline stocks is right after a plane crash. Sick but true.

Government contracts are the other boon to Boeing. 

I will say one thing I do not like about Boeing, and this is from a personal preference standpoint. I’ve worked on the 727, 757, 767, and 777. I’m not impressed by the engineering. I find a general lack of redundancy, poor follow through on design principles, a lack of technical information, and poor quality control on airplanes new from the factory. I don’t expect any of that to be worth anything regarding the stock price, but I feel like Airbus makes a superior product albeit generally more expensive.

Edit: I should note that Boeing still puts out a safe product and I fly on them all the time. I’m just not impressed with their product.",TackleMySpackle,5,/r/stocks/comments/mhfcy3/ba_thoughts_on_boeing/gsyhm1c/,0.149,0.768,0.083,-0.9392

960,MAX," I agree, but you also got to look at the lifecycle of a Boeing plane and the slow path to recovery. Boeing undergoes huge debt coming into each plane they build. 

However, the improvements on each new plane in recent years is extremely marginal, and their lifecycle is ~20-30 years. 

With travel still low and expected to stay low, it’s a difficult hole to climb out of, especially when airliners already have Boeing and airbus planes and have little reasons to upgrade (only reason to upgrade is due to hitting the 30 year life cycle or their plane usage is so high that the economy of better gas mileage is more beneficial with a MAX plane). The MAX is also almost the same exact tech as the planes they delivered 20-30 years ago. Heavily invested startups are working on making hypersonic and electric planes. Boeing is not, and they don’t have the money to do so. Layoffs are high.

TLDR: Boeing is not an airliner. They are in massive debt. They sell planes. Nobody needs planes, and they won’t for a while. They are only down 18% in share price on the two-year. They are overvalued.",marslunar,0,/r/stocks/comments/mhfcy3/ba_thoughts_on_boeing/gsykaco/,0.07,0.843,0.087,0.5483
