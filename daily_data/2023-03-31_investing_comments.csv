Auto loans are already at 9-10% at a lot of places, at my CU we have priced ourselves out because we don’t want to keep adding loans when the only people taking them are desperate enough to pay 10% on an auto at the 700-740 FICO tier.",borkyborkus,4,/r/investing/comments/127pnir/us_banks_have_620_billion_of_unrealized_losses_on/jefn0rb/,0.066,0.893,0.041,-0.2263
3,UBS," OK, so the pandemic hits and some people move money out of the stock market and into their savings accounts (these people are trying to time the market, something that is inherently dumb). Now XYZ bank has an extra 1 B and they feel the need to invest a portion of that. So the bank invests in the only low risk asset classes available: treasuries and mortgages. 

But were the banks really dumb enough to not think that those extra inflows might out flow at some point? At some point rates might be higher? At some point the pandemic related restrictions would be gone (or greatly reduced)? Where was the up side here, that the pandemic would go on forever and that people would thus keep money in their .1% yield savings account in perpetuity? 

It looks a lot like banks bet the farm on the world ending to get .6% yield, the world didn't end but they still lost the farm. I guess the up side was that the world would end but then you would have a second farm in ~120 years. Again, banks that did this were really dumb. 

I would emphasize that it appears that losses are not evenly distributed across all banks. 620 B is a big number but relative to the US financial market it isn't really that big. To quote the article: 'For most banks, the issue is manageable.'. The news that I was reading claimed that Credit Suisse at the time of being bought by UBS had assets to cover all its accounts (although this could be lies). It appears that not all banks have issues but it is still worth while to question the logic of the banks that did/will/might collapse because they assumed that Fed rates would never increase.",PuffyPanda200,4,/r/investing/comments/127pnir/us_banks_have_620_billion_of_unrealized_losses_on/jefkqyd/,0.085,0.859,0.056,-0.9248
4,JPM," >	The reality is the smartest people take their money out first. There simply isn’t a point for them to risk losing their own money when other people at the same bank COULD cause a bank run leaving you behind.

To put it where..? The bigger balance sheet banks? This isn’t really a systematic issue. SVB is a very unique situation with unique depositors. 

>	You don’t know the other people and you also don’t know the bank’s balance sheet. 

We do as of 12/31, but also most of these banks are now trying to pre plan with liquidity options to protect a bank run. 

SVB had a $42bn bank run, JPM wouldn’t even withstand that.

6,CPA," The words unrealized loss and opportunity cost are not interchangeable terms.  Neither are market risk and interest rate risk. Individual bonds held to maturity do not have market risk, while bond funds and banks holding AFS securities do.  Both HTM and AFS securities are usually subject to interest rate risk.  Market risk and interest rate risk are separate issues.  All these terms have different and specific meanings and are not interchangeable.   [In a CPA exam, unrealized losses are not applicable to bonds held to maturity](https://www.universalcpareview.com/ask-joey/are-realized-gains-or-losses-recorded-for-held-to-maturity-debt-securities/). Holding to maturity of individual bonds protects against unrealized losses / market risk, not interest rate risk, which is an opportunity cost.

7,USA," 48, USA, fulltime employed but not a big earner, just getting started looking at actually investing, so far sticking with ETFs with dividends.  Looking at a few individual stocks but it seems like a hairy time to choose, looks like everything is going down ..??

Anyway, big question is, about to sell my condo and move from the city to a small town, if all goes according to plan I will have $20k profits...but I also don't have much of a retirement fund *and* I want the option to move back if I hate it.  So far the plan is to stick that money \*somewhere\* for a trial year, and if I'm good with small-town life, it becomes retirement fund.

Am I better off sticking with a certificate or high yield savings account for that interim time, or is there something more constructive I could do with that money, where it would still be accessible after a year or two..?",EducationalOcelot4,1,/r/investing/comments/127fd0g/daily_general_discussion_and_advice_thread_march/jeekci4/,0.031,0.868,0.1,0.879

11,CD," Once you have the inheritance, you're going to want a fiduciary, fee based, financial advisor for detailed guidance. If you want random internet opinions:

1. If you're planning to stay where you're living now for a couple years, I'd buy a house (fully inspected with someone you hire) you and your fiancée want in cash. Interest rates are high, no need to finance if you have a choice.
2. Put aside a year's worth salary as an emergency fund in a high yield savings account or no penalty CD. Ally has an 11 month CD that pays out 5%. You could put 250k there insured. If you want to save more, there are other accounts like Marcus you could put 250k each in. You want this liquid.
3. Max out your retirement contribution limits for both you and your fiancée every year (401k,  you could even open a 529 for yourself and eventually transfer it to your child if/when that happens), do that in perpetuity. Investigate potentially doing backdoor roth since your income is probably over the roth limit. fiduciary could help with that and more complex strategies that 5 mill could get you in the door on.
4. Whatever your fiduciary says. See if the person you're inheriting from had an advisor they used, obviously they did pretty well. For my personal investment account, I like a mix of index funds bought in batches- VTI 70%, VXUS 20% AVUV 10%. I would not lump sum in at today's prices, I would place part of your money in every month or so.

13,EU," Just to clarify - there is really no such thing as high-yield US treasuries. The term ""high-yield"" when applied to bond instruments means debt with a quality rating of less than BB+. Commonly known as junk bonds. 

US treasuries are considered high-quality debt with AAA ratings. 

If you are outside the US - you have to check with your broker to see if you can access sovereign debt products like US treasuries. If your broker doesn't offer access to holding t-bills and t-notes, you can always access US treasury debt using UCITS compliant funds as an EU resident. 

Depending on the average duration of US treasuries that you seek, there are popular UCITS products available from Blackrock, Invesco, and SSgA.

For example:

[https://www.blackrock.com/americas-offshore/en/products/307241/ishares-treasury-bond-0-1yr-ucits-etf](https://www.blackrock.com/americas-offshore/en/products/307241/ishares-treasury-bond-0-1yr-ucits-etf) 

[https://www.ssga.com/uk/en\_gb/institutional/etfs/funds/spdr-bloomberg-us-treasury-bond-ucits-etf-dist-sybt-gy](https://www.ssga.com/uk/en_gb/institutional/etfs/funds/spdr-bloomberg-us-treasury-bond-ucits-etf-dist-sybt-gy)

Note that there will be versions of these UCITS funds depending on whether you want accumulating, distributing, and the currency. Because these are fixed income funds - there will likely be various average durations as well.",greytoc,1,/r/investing/comments/127fd0g/daily_general_discussion_and_advice_thread_march/jeeicit/,0.072,0.824,0.104,0.3832

15,OP," Hmmm a couple of comments / questions on this post, OP

>Boycotting these industries may not create substantial change, as other investors may still fill the void.

Very true - I work in institutional financial advisory in the energy industry. We've seen **a fuckton** of institutions including in their mandates that they won't sink capital into traditional oil and gas activities.......which is fine, most public E&P's have barely increased their capital budgets for this very reason (cost of capital).

But at the same time.......that just opens the doors for private operators to spend like crazy on exploratory drilling (lookin' at you Hilcorp....)

>Investing in controversial industries contributes to the continuation of harmful practices.

True. Boycotting an industry - at the individual level - isn't going to accomplish anything other than virtue signaling (and probably poor risk-adjusted returns to boot). However, this works at the institutional level, noted above.

>Ethical investing in industries such as renewable energy and sustainable agriculture has the potential for both financial gains and positive societal impacts.

Institutions were thinking the same thing during 2021. They're pulling back now and are much more wary with management teams promising +100% unlevered IRRs by the time they're hitting runrate on ambitious, capital intensive projects

>Investors should consider the long-term consequences of supporting controversial industries, which may suffer from changing regulations and public sentiment.

True, but often times (at least in the energy transition space), I've found most retail investors are pretty clueless on the inner workings of how renewable energy companies generate cash flow and what that means to you as a provider of equity capital - e.g. knowing what a RIN or LCFS curve is and how they both move in relation to WTI/HH; how complicated financial structures work, especially when they're capitalized with pretty exotic private debt / equity instruments like convertible pref shares or using debt from any of the private credit shops out there; among other things)

Most redditors understand renewable energy at a pretty surface-deep level (solar / wind electric utilities are renewable so that means they're guaranteed good investments! nuclear energy is a great source of energy, so this uranium miner can't lose!) without understanding the insanely complicated (and changing) nuances of risk / return trade off or even something as simple as how these tickers make money at all lol",Jeff__Skilling,2,/r/investing/comments/127i7wr/investing_in_controversial_industries/jefb2ot/,0.082,0.719,0.199,0.9952
