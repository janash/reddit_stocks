0,IMO," OP, I think you're definitely on the right track. Predicting the precise timing of a crash isnt going to happen, but I also see a big crash coming. 

Between the Buffet indicator, Ray Dalio's debt cycles, the insanely high levels of speculation, and the even more mind-boggling levels of money printing, this isn't going to end well IMO. 

I haven't seen one commenter that agrees with you, and I'm seeing your comments getting downvoted, but I don't think you're crazy.

1,JP," Let's say the stock market is overvalued. I can agree with this. But then what would you do with your money if you would have a lot of them? (aka pension fund)

Buy Bonds??? With some national bonds in EU and JP fetching negative returns .... how's that market (which is bigger notionally than the stock market) valued?

Buy a rock? Like Gold? Yeah some actually do ad it makes sense. If supply is constraint and has some value, then even if it costs to store the rock ... it can beat a bond actually. Especially if you get inflation in the next years. But would you put everything in gold just for that?

Buy a digital rock? Like bitcoin? Yeah .. same story as above only with less marginal utility and more speculative potential.

There is not a lot of options if you are a big fund. So you need to have at least part of your assets locked in the stockmarket ... and as bond market looks probably more scary the part in stockmarket is probably not small and might have increased. I mean compared to the stockmarket how does a 0.5% treasure note look to you?  If there is some inflation and you new to hike that rate even to 1% ... that piece of paper will lose 1/2 of its value.  Now that's something even more expensive and risky than the stockmarket I would say ... even of it's classified as Zero Risk :)

Most probably hedge heavily with puts but these are expensive as f..k right now.

Edit:

Forgot cash. Would you hold USD giving the above trends and some risk that the inflation picks up?  Or even if you have QE driven asset inflation.  How's that for an asset class.

5,GDP," After they sell in the near future, where are investors going to put their money? What triggers the crash? Look at commodity prices, we're entering inflation. 

There are posts here pointing at fundamentals every week, GDP/market cap, various P/E ratios, etc. the former measure is defunct due to the liquidity environment, and the P/E ratios are only useful for picking out individual stocks. These factors are meaningless without economic context, the relative attractiveness of other investments and the stability of the underlying assets (are companies going under? Are they unable to raise debt? Are people defaulting?).

This is the perspective I'm going to use when asking when there's going to be a ""correction."" When it eventually comes, it'll be a major crash.

The reason for this is 3 fold.
1) New investors who don't know what they are doing.
2) New investors bringing more more into the market.
3) There isn't much other methods of investing to get money, interest rates being what they are. Until interest rates increase, we will have a steady creep up.",Ethan0pia,1,/r/investing/comments/lk688l/is_now_the_time_to_jump_ship_50_of_nysenasdaq/gnj5i38/,0.039,0.839,0.122,0.8807

8,TTM," > He took the 100 least profitable companies in 2019 (pre-covid)

The 100 least profitable from what population?

> Of the 5,000 equities, Over 3,130 have posted a >100% return from their 52 week low

That doesn't surprise me.  A year ago we were in full pandemic panic (remember Ackerman's meltdown on CNBC).  A year ago I was convinced that the cruise industry would basically cease to exist, and I wasn't alone.  People were predicting 30% long-term unemployment.  People have quickly forgotten how dire the predictions were (and likely how dire things would have been) without the trillions of dollars of stimulus.

> So 2,500, or ~50% of the total universe of equities on NYSE + NASDAQ, over a 12 month window, have not been profitable (as defined by TTM EPS <0).

Pandemic.  Why would you base your analysis of future results upon a period where we were enduring a worldwide pandemic, inducing massive government-mandated business restrictions?  That's not normal.

> There will be a ""major correction"" in 2021

Define ""major correction"".  Do I expect a 10% decline in the S&P500 sometime in the next 10 months?  It wouldn't surprise me.  I'd give it probably a 75% chance of happening.

Do I expect a 30% decline in the S&P500 in the next 10 months?  It could happen, but I give it about a 5% chance of happening - especially if we're talking about a 30% decline from where we are today.  If it goes up another 50% and then drops 30%, that's still a gain.",Bobby_does_reddit,1,/r/investing/comments/lk688l/is_now_the_time_to_jump_ship_50_of_nysenasdaq/gnj6s32/,0.081,0.871,0.048,-0.4876

10,GME," I think this ""jump ship"" is reasonable to think rn but your math doesn't factor in the huge amounts of retail investing in the market and retail habits when equity buying are looking for ""undervalue"" (whatever that may mean to them). And it's not like Retail has always been so blasé with speculation, brokerage apps like Robinhood allowing options trading for everyone who can spell their name with crayon has been normalizing speculative investing even with equity buying. Add on the fact that Robinhood deliberately designs itself like a phone game is an attempt to program you to take less risk with your own money.

What's happening is massive influxes of buying against equities that otherwise haven't fundamentally changed their picture. I know Reddit let's you track it in real time (PLTR, GME, SNDL) and CNBC loves to act like reddit moves as a cohesive unit but ultimately the market has been increasingly speculative for the entire post-covid rally (NIO's Market cap bigger than Honda? I mean you gotta be kidding, but I don't see any sign of that obvious disparity adjusting soon) but I don't think there's really a crystal ball on when to take one's gains and float-away on the driftwood.",WuTangStockTrading,1,/r/investing/comments/lk688l/is_now_the_time_to_jump_ship_50_of_nysenasdaq/gnjenp8/,0.06,0.865,0.075,0.4641
11,EV," Think not of inflation as much as purchasing power risk. They should be similar, but the measure of inflation is backwards as it has to exist first to be measured. Purchasing power risk, however, is forward looking: how much would it take to buy something in the future? 

Market prices are always about the future, and the markets we are discussing are valued in dollars. In dollars, the entire S&P 500 was worth roughly $26.72T one year ago (pre-covid). We had a year of basically no production because covid prevented real growth, but have pumped or will expect total pumping of $5T. Guess what the S&P is at in terms of market cap in dollars? $31.3T or 94% of 1 year ago if you account for printed money of $5T. This also makes things make sense: the market IS down because of COVID, it has NOT recovered.

2020 was a pretty terrible year, but the core takeaway is that to buy nearly (a slightly worse) market today would cost $4.58T(>17%) more than 1 year ago. That’s inflation, but earlier than it gets measured at the consumer level.

Now, is that money printing going to lead to inflation? Well, cars provided roughly the same utility in 2010 as they did at the start of 2020, but the average new car cost went from $28k to $37.5K (133% for the same utility). Preceding by 2 years (starting and ending slightly earlier as inflation takes some time to enter consumer prices) S&P went from $12T to $22.6T. Fed balance sheet expanded from around $0.8T to $4.4T. $3.6T (4.4-.8) is 30% of $12T so if you follow the same logic where inflation will roughly equal the percentage of market value that is printed money, you would expect an item with $28k of utility in 2010 to provide the same utility but cost  $36.4K in 2020. That’s pretty damn close to what actually happened.

Now, $5T is 18.7% of $26.72T and it was printed  in a year, not five years or a decade.  Black swan, I know, but if the average new car costs $44.2T in 3-5 years don’t complain to me. Of course, in the car example I’d expect some adjustment from a bit less utility because work from home and other remote services got a lot more common very quickly(not to mention EV vs gas), but still I won’t be surprised if inflation is quite high the next few years (and I feel that is priced into the market already).",uslashuname,1,/r/investing/comments/lk688l/is_now_the_time_to_jump_ship_50_of_nysenasdaq/gnk1zih/,0.041,0.895,0.064,0.8762

21,GDP," So In my opinion, we are at the start of a new business cycle. We saw a drop in interest rates, a recession (2 consecutive quarters of GDP decline), and are at the start of a recovery. 

I think what's so unique about this last recession was how quickly the market recovered. Most of this can be attributed to unprecedented level of timely fiscal and monetary stimulus. Sentiment quickly recovered, and investors took advantage of an opportunity to buy in cheap.

I think the market is correctly buying into speculation of upcoming growth. My concern though is a few years out. The federal reserve has committed to 3 years of low interest rates, and has said they won't pro-actively raise rates, and will even tolerate high inflation to offset past years of low inflation. We've heard language about how the headline unemployment numbers aren't accurate, and they're prioritizing maximum employment over inflation.

Knowing this, I suspect companies will load up on debt due to cheap credit.

I think this objective will lead to higher inflation, that will go unaddressed at first. Only once it rises to concerning levels will the fed act, and I suspect we will either see an underreaction at first(ie raise 25 basis points), or an overreaction.

34,BIG," at the macro level the savings rate in the United States is actually up BIG since the pandemic started. much of the stimulus money was saved. I can't share all of the data i have access to, but here is an article that does a pretty solid job explaining

35,IMO," It's weird how wildly different many (I wanna say ""most"") people's experiences are with economic factors in the pandemic. It seems like it's either feast or famine, with nobody in the middle ground. 

I'm in the group that hasn't been affected at all and I've been left with nowhere and nothing to spend money on, so I just dump it in the market. 

I do think the market will cool-off this summer because I think a lot of that money that's been going into it will get diverted back into the service economy. I don't think people are necessarily looking to sell a lot of equities, but IMO they won't be buying as many.",Zendrifta,2,/r/investing/comments/lk688l/is_now_the_time_to_jump_ship_50_of_nysenasdaq/gnjnl66/,0.03,0.943,0.027,-0.0816
36,IT," Probably you're right - but one needs to be careful about bias. I don't know many people severely affected (yet), but my filter bubble consists mainly of highly-educated people in science and IT who will probably be the last ones losing their job (of course you can cut 50% staff in a company but good luck getting rid of a lot of IT); and a lot of them work in public organisations or otherwise long-term funded entities.

Yet I read every day of large industrial companies here that shut down manufacturing plans, plan to fire 1,000 people here, 1,000 people there. Not sure it is because of Corona, but Corona is a nice reason to argue cuts, regardless if businesses are profitable or not. I see a huge share of brick-and-mortar retail in a dying stage (it wasn't running well before Corona and now they just hope to get stimulus help). I'm seeing more and more empty businesses on the street, from restaurants to motorbike megastores to massage studios to car dealerships. So, something is definitely happening. Commercial real estate will be severely hit I guess. Entire chains of industries are just kept alive through government help (e.g. clubs & bars, events, ...).

On the other hand, I know a few businesses who actually profited from Corona, because they have already been zombie companies and can now continue to exist just because they get some subsidies which keep them alive artificially. But this doesn't make the economic outlook better. As soon as the subsidies cease, these companies will just add to the Corona-caused bankruptcy wave.

All of this seems to be a nuclear disruptive event of the economy to me. There will be winners (digitalisation), and there will be many losers. But again, this is a subjective view and it probably also depends on the country you are living in.",git_und_slotermeyer,1,/r/investing/comments/lk688l/is_now_the_time_to_jump_ship_50_of_nysenasdaq/gnk5xv7/,0.129,0.731,0.14,0.8451
37,IMO," \> Research consumer and social psychology trends. Millennial’s interest in  health and wellness, travel, finding new online services to more  efficiently do work and are conscious of company’s impact on the  environment.  


IMO this is an edge that every millenial has over many older investors. The reason: older people can't fully empathize as easily with millenials and will have a harder time understanding the consumer trends. That means millenial investors (that are trained in investing) are in general better suited to understand the value that companies have that serve millenials.  


One (laborious) way to test this is by gathering old newspapers of the 80's and 90's, get stock market data from then and simulate some stock picking from then.",Radiant-Experience21,3,/r/investing/comments/lk1b48/heuristics_and_research_for_speculative_investing/gnizf7o/,0.0,0.869,0.131,0.9419

I disagree with this, I read Graham's book, and closely looked at the S&P500 chart there and pulled all the data from today of the S&P500 as well. From 1970 to 1990, you'd earn almost nothing due to inflation.

57,EV," No Capital gains for me! Best way to capitalize on this?

**This is not clickbait.**

I seem to find myself in a very lucky position due to the fact that I'm subject to no capital gains tax due to being a [non-resident alien](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/06/nonusresidenttax.asp) and also my country imposes no capital gains taxes on income obtained outside of our territory.

Since this tax benefit is only for stocks (dividends are subject to a flat 30% tax rate) I was thinking of getting into stocks, mainly index fund ETF's such as VOO and ARK funds (but I'm worried that most of them have TSLA on their holdings and even though I love TSLA and all their values and how they have made EV popular, I believe they are massively overvalued and people seem to forget they are a car company and not a tech company.) I'm very aggressive so maybe 80% stocks and 20% bonds?

The sad part is because I live in a 3rd world country my income is substantially lower ($800 USD/Month) I do live with my parents so no rent and no food and basically no bills for now, but I would like to leave the nest once I'm more financially stable.

80,AMD," Hi!

I am 28 living in southern California. I have a goal of saving for a house in 5 years. At the same time I am trying to save for retirement. I have a 401k and some stock but I am also looking in opening a ROTH IRA and put in the 6k limit for the 2020 tax year before I file taxes. I am open to more investing that is somewhat safe but I am open to a little risk.

Curious what other think I should do. Here is my financial info. Values are rounded up estimates:

**---Income and Expenses---**

* Making $70k/year. Might go up to as high as $80k soon.
* Net monthly income is \~$3600/month.
* Monthly expenses (rent, utilities, groceries, subscriptions, etc.) is \~$2300
* Transfer $1k /month into personal savings
* Usually leaves me $200-300/month for anything else.
* I can cut back on some expenses (recurring subscriptions, cable) that could net me potentially $200 more per month.
* No loans
* 100% on time full balance credit card payments.

**---Savings and Investments---**

* \~$27k in personal savings.
* \~$15k in a 401k. Doing 5% with matching. Employer matches 100% on the first 3% and 50% on the next 2%.
* $1k in AMD stock. Looking to hold this until I am planning on buying a house in 5 years.",Zoltt93,1,/r/investing/comments/lkakug/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gnk86sh/,0.038,0.889,0.073,0.8036

88,GDP," Hello to all, I'm new to investing and I can only use Trading212. I'm 26 year old, living in Kosovo. I'm self employed as a Dentist, currently making around 500-750€/month  on a small private practice owned by my mother, depending on work volume. I have minimum expenses, no debts, around 6000€ savings in the bank and 1400€ on crypto assets, varying day by day.

I have lost some money I could afford to lose on $NOK, now I only have 41,000 shares on $HCMC. I would like to divide my investments into :

1.	⁠Short trades, to get some fast money so I can invest on commercial or residential real estate since the infrastructure here is still growing rapidly (buy a store so I can rent it out for fixed passive income and then  buy more accordingly). Good and new locations are priced at 2000-3000€/m2...If I had 100,000€ cash, I'd pay 30-50% upfront to buy 2-3 places and use the rent to pay the installments plus passive income for 15 years (bank loan interests here are somewhat same like in US eventhough our GDP is miles lower.)
2.	⁠Long hold trades: for diversified income.

At my age, having read some books which changed my perspective and having two self made millionaires in my family circle, I'm interested in being wealthy, rather than rich or look rich. I love cars but I'd rather buy real estate which can bring me passive income from which I can finance a car...

I tried to put as much details as the pinned post here said. I don't have much knowledge on Trading, so apart from advice on what I said, feel free to put some book I can learn something from.

98,UK," If you're looking for the lowest possible risk then you may want to shy away from stocks and look into bonds. You appear to be investing 100% in stocks. I would even say that having 20% or so of your investments in bonds, even when going for a higher risk strategy, would be beneficial. If you're really wanting lowest possible risk, then look at bond ETFs, or bond funds as being part (or maybe even all) of your portfolio.

I'm also curious as to why you're allocating 40% in FAANG (that's huge!) when you want the lowest possible risk. Tech is... well, not known for stable returns.

132,IMO," Well, first thing is the US has a marginal tax rate, so the real question would be what to do when you are getting close to moving up on the marginal rate pyramid.  You are also only thinking of income tax, many states don't have income tax but will have property tax to compensate.  Furthermore, you need to look at whether the State where you will reside taxes Social Security benefits.  All this is true whether or not the marginal rates change or not.

But to answer your question: it is but not enough to potentially sacrifice gains now.  

The answer to me would be in the balance of 401k to Roth and Open Accounts.  401k match by your employer now along with growth should offset any concern on tripping the next higher marginal tax rate.  While the US tax rate will increase, IMO, we will not move from a marginal scheme to a flat scheme. I use this site to get an understanding of what my income will trigger what marginal rate:  [https://engaging-data.com/marginal-tax-rates/](https://engaging-data.com/marginal-tax-rates/)   I would shoot to stay in the 12% before getting bounced to the 22% marginal rate.

I intend to use the 401k as the basis to get to the top of one of the marginal rates (see 12% v 22% above) then the Roth to address any need shortfalls.  Also, Capital Gains are not taxed as income (i.e. from a job) but independently and at significantly lower rates, IMO, so an Open Account where you buy your Tesla, Apple, Microsoft, Sundial, etc and cash out as long-term Capital Gains should be advantageous.

You can play this game every year and adjust accordingly to the total income/property tax impacts depending on where you live and the marginal rates at that time.

141,IP," A few additional points

Align (Invisalign is primarily a brand at this point. They spend massive amounts on marketing. Their product actually is not superior any more. There are other companies with products that are as good, or better than Invisalign, what they do not have is the brand). 

Align is direct-to-consumer, but I also think that limits their growth opportunities. Traditional dental companies like Densply-Sirona, Straumann and Ormco have long-term relationships with the specialist. As those traditional companies improve/expand their offerings they should be able to increase penetration in this category through partnerships. Also, more complex cases, will require a product with different capabilities. 

Theres many other smaller companies launching in this space trying to undercut Align, will be interesting to see how that brand matters over the longterm. 

China is a tricky one. It will be very challenging for them to preserve their IP/brand loyalty. What's to stop a Chinese competitor from succeeding against Align? More price sensitive market as well. 

That said this is a well positioned company in an attractive market, and its price reflects that. This is a hold for me.",swan797,2,/r/investing/comments/lk67pa/align_technologies_due_diligence_algn/gnjpurt/,0.032,0.768,0.201,0.9877
142,ALGN," Agree with what you said. Esp about the massive run up already.

Will add for OP that: while I don't think it's bad to invest in ALGN if you are planning to hold long. I will say there might be some things they should consider before adding in a new position into ALGN

1. How dominant ALGN has been ***because*** of covid and how the dentists were locked down or people didn't/can't see them. 

2. How much of that dominance will wane when everything reopens.  People don't see the pandemic lock down as a good time to get braces.

3. And how much of a moat ALGN really has since other companies like SDC has already gone IPO on the same business model but they do what ALGN does for less.

4. IMO their main and only real ""moat"" is the Invisalign brand name. But if ""Invisalign"" goes through brand genericization (which IMO it already has) then what moats do they really have? If see-through plastic braces are all called ""Invisaligns"" like how all cola is ""coke"", people don't say ""do an online search"" but ""google it"", copies were ""Xerox"", and all dick hardening meds are ""Viagra"". How dominant will ALGN remain? Will it be a Google where no one uses Bing even though it's there? Or will it be Coke where Pepsi has taken a chunk of the market? Or maybe end up like Aspirin (yes Aspirin used to be a brand name like Google/Coke/Xerox/Invisalign)?

5. Why not just by SDC? Consider researching it first since it's not up 300% like the other guy said. It's growing just as fast but it's share price is still around IPO.",zxc123zxc123,3,/r/investing/comments/lk67pa/align_technologies_due_diligence_algn/gnk1kr5/,0.025,0.881,0.094,0.9463

145,IMO," Probably pretty low. If it were going to happen, it would have happened by now. The tech isn't outrageously difficult and invisalign has a lot of traction and inertia within the profession and with the general public/patient pool.

However, I believe the greatest threat to invisalign is orthodontists bypassing them altogether and fabricating trays in their own offices with a 3D printer. Hard to say how likely it is to happen, but IMO, that's the greater threat.",schmearcampain,3,/r/investing/comments/lk67pa/align_technologies_due_diligence_algn/gnjozek/,0.112,0.76,0.128,0.1025
