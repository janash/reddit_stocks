31,AI," Old simpsons animations were like half the reason the show was so good. Now everything has computer-generated shadows which makes it ""look good"" but the characters move in the same boring predictable ways. Family Guy is by far the worst offender for this with every fucking character doing the EXACT same animation EVERY time they talk. Arms up, palms facing away. It's like rather than the animator think ""I wonder how the character might express themselves in this specific situation"" they just pick ""Smile A"" and ""Stance F"" as a close approximation from the presets they have. Everyone shit on ""the polar express"" for the characters being so lifeless and rigid but now everything looks like that.

I hope that in the near future hand-drawn animation will be able to make a return by using AI to fill in missing frames and then tidied up by the animators to reduce the workload. Maybe the current standards for animation will be seen as a sort of dark ages between the golden era of animation and the AI era of animation.",Stulander_best,35,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nr97ko/once_upon_a_time/h0fnd09/,0.106,0.795,0.099,-0.558

43,GME," Has anyone ever seen a message that shorts have covered that they believe?

Think about it.  If they are telling you they covered why are they telling yiu?

 it’s rare to hear someone say they covered except 
1) when a hedge fund is about to blow up and the reason is to stem withdrawals or 
2) they are trying to mislead you because they can’t cover or 
3) both.  Usually it’s 3.  So don’t believe them.  

If they do actually cover why would they tell you?  They don’t care.  They are out. 

So fact is we never know if shorts covered.  The data is wrong.  It can be masked. GME DD covers this in detail.  

Therefore if you say I’m not selling until they cover then you are probably only trying to trick yourself.

46,AMC," Call me a salty hater all you want but I have two things.
1. Why hold into close? Highly unlikely to continue this pump and you’re really close to expiration on some of these ie, no time value. Strategically why hold into close?
2. Imagine you’re a hedge fund, you have shorted AMC and now you have a huge unrealized loss on the position. You can a) close the position into a huge adverse price movement while closing, therefore not only realizing the loss but making it way worse.
B) continue to pay the cost of borrowing the shares, which is a known cost but is likely to be far less than the cost of realizing the huge loss. Piling more shorts on during this crazy pump is probably the best way for them to cover their losses.
Finally the ultimate question for wall street bets, how long do you hold a pump when you’re making a shit ton of money?

Which means it might hit $90-100 in the next few days.

105,AMC," GameStop hit a top Market Cap of $33B by my math and AMC is currently at $30B. So 10% tomorrow, or ~$69 (which it hit today) would be the equivalent to GME’s ceiling. 

As far as I’m concerned, this is as much a casino as a rebranding. Short term- lots of volatility up or down. Long term it depends entirely on the rebranding and shareholders willingness to sell or hold. Plenty companies are overvalued because that’s what shareholders think they are worth. 

I agree $100 will be a psychological barrier, but the first sign of selling and you’ll have people cutting losses or taking gains too. So then steep drop. Otherwise margin calls, shorts covering, retail refuses to sell (all of retail, 20% is all the legit shorts need to cover), and this could go up a bit more, and fast.

126,AMC," A friend of mine, even though I begged him not to, sank all of his money (meaning everything in his bank accounts, and pawning his (deceased) father's watch) into GME the morning of January 29th. I told him to wait for a dip after all the nonsense from Robinhood, but he genuinely believed it was going to hit $10k the following week. He'd started moving money into RH earlier that week, and it took him a while to get everything tidy before he was ready to buy. 

At least I convinced him to hold for as long as he can, but he's down around 30% still. Sad part is he's not exactly wealthy, and he's had to stretch (and borrow a bit from me, which of course I don't mind doing) to make it work. 

Buyer beware. These memestocks are volatile, and you can't predict hype prices with 100% accuracy. Look at AMC this morning. I think it'll recover, but who knows? If you bought at $65 yesterday, you're probably not having a good morning. Just... realize that it's a gamble. I think some of them are **good** gambles, but I would never, ever, ever, **ever** recommend spending money you need for **food and f\*&\^ing shelter** on *any* investment. These are longer plays than you might think. 

Also, a lot of these new investors seem to think they just hit ""sell"" and money magically appears. Someone has to buy it. Just because the price is at $10k doesn't mean you can sell it for $10k. It could be less. Significantly less. It's more than just timing the top, it's timing the top and being able to sell what you want to at that price.

129,AMC," Investing rules for most people need to be essentially the same as gambling, because at worst it's that not much different; only bet what you can afford to lose. That doesn't include your rent, food, loan payments, etc.

Meme stocks can certainly help if you get in at the right time, but people that don't already have lots of $$ to invest at once in one thing generally aren't going to be overnight millionaires.  If you bought into AMC/GME back in 2020 with change fished out of the couch, you made out, probably paid off some debt and good for you; but most of those folks didn't know what was going to happen later on in 2021.

Making smart, long-term choices based on sensible growth is what gets you long-lasting gains.  If you have some play $$, sure, shoot the works or get in on penny stocks or an AMC if you get some info. But few 'putting your entire weekly paycheck into meme stonk' situations are going to pay off before you need that $$, if you're paycheck-to-paycheck or close to it.",lordcochise,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nrbin0/for_you_noobs/h0g639q/,0.06,0.826,0.114,0.9032

462,BB," Good afternoon! What a morning! Thank you all to those who wrote some very thoughtful responses and gave awards, it really made my morning and kinda made the dip in BB stocks hurt a bit less. 

I just want to clarify a few things here folks:

1.) Nothing of what I wrote is financial advice of any kind. I just wanted to share a personal story and no WAY I thought it would move to the front page of WSB. I'm a late-comer to this, as a few have pointed out, this but I'm hoping for success just as much as all of you. Been at this for a short while and the biggest lesson I've learned is to invest responsibly and be willing to live with the consequences. That's all I can say. 

2.) I definitely have zero alterior or sketchy motives in commenting/posting. I hold a small amount of the shares and definitely am not set to make life-changing money from them. If you hold or buy lots more based on what I wrote, I wish you so much success and wealth and I'll be cheering you from the sidelines with my tiny amount... definitely not from some corporate office holding millions in my tightly clutched hands lol. But I won't ever encourage anyone to do one thing or another with their hard earned cash. Not my place. 

3.) I'm a proud Canadian first, and I also am proud of everything BB achieved. That is now and will forever be my only motivation. 

Hopefully that clears things up because, to be honest, my wife and I were starting to get a bit sketched out by a few of the angry conspiracy comments in here. Cheers all!

469,NET," I worked 1 whole year at Jabil Circuit Ltd. Hungary as a Quality Inspector back in 2010 when RIM (the once existing Research In  Motion, now BlackBerry Ltd.) ordered from our company to assemble a shit ton of BlackBerry smartphones. I worked 12 hours shifts, 3 days in a row, either from 6 pm to 6 am or reversed... After the 3 days were over, 3 days of free time began, then back to 3 days of work again. Rinse and repeat.

I rented a nearby room next to a chemical factory for literal pennies. To be fair my monthly salary was pennies as well, from HUF (Hungarian Forints) to USD it was like NET 300 USD back then... Back then I was 19 years old, not having any real-life experiences or any significant degree. Basically, I was a kid with such different views about the world compared to how I currently view it... I can say I was naive. But, I met a lot of great people, had once in a lifetime experiences, feelings, I just had to be there. At the end of the day, I'm proud that I had that 1 year in my life. 

Now I'm almost 30 years old, having my 9th job since then, and working as a software developer. A lot changed since then. I changed a LOT. When I think about that era, it almost feels like it happened in another, previous life.

520,BB," Waterloo local here as well, not sure I agree with the sentiment that the town turned its back on BB.  We held on to hope for a very long time they would turn it around, BB is one of the things that put Waterloo on the map, of course we wanted them to succeed.  The things in the region that could help like Communitech etc aren't geared towards huge companies like that, they are trying to help startups.  

BB made some very poor land purchase decisions during the decline, and while they laid their employees well if could be argued they paid them too well and that was part of their downfall. I regularly have conversations with former and current BBers who made 200k+ for roles that shouldn't pay remotely that much.",ballbrewing,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nrdbzc/once_upon_a_time_i_was_a_bb_factory_worker_bb/h0god51/,0.08,0.76,0.161,0.8798
521,AMC," Lowkey kind of how I feel about $AMC. I’m from Kansas City where they’re headquartered outside of. I had a pretty troubling youth and movies were always an “escape” for me. I love the atmosphere, I love the stories. I love being entranced in the experience of the cinema. In college I used to go to discount Tuesdays after class and watch whatever I could to de-stress from my class work. My fiancée and I used to go once a month to the big AMC outside their HQ before COVID. We’re pretty healthy people who made that one of our “cheat” days where we’d load up on pizza and popcorn. When COVID happened, I sincerely worried about that magical oasis that often was a place for me to escape a turbulent home, to relax after calc and physics classes, and became a place of genuine relaxation with the love of my life. I don’t care what happens to the stock price. I just hope they survive. Fuck the people trying to run them into the ground. I’m with you AMC holders. I’m with you until the end. The only profit I will take is off of the options. I won’t sell the stock. 💎👐📽🎞",Theorist816,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nrdbzc/once_upon_a_time_i_was_a_bb_factory_worker_bb/h0gqjks/,0.041,0.754,0.205,0.9889

1135,BB," Google ‘options calculator’ and play around with one a bit and study how the variables affect each other. Particularly read up on IV (implied volatility) and how it affects the price of an option contract. Basically if you’re buying options, lower IV is better (because the option will be cheaper). Right now the IV on BB is quite high (so you’ll buying at a premium) and if the underlying price action settles down (IV drops drastically), you’ll most likely lose money even if the stock price rises slowly. That’s known as IV crush and it’s one reason why shares might be the better play right now.

1136,AMC," Ok quick question, and sorry because I know I'm being that guy and asking a really dumb question here that reveals how little I actually understand this casino that I've been playing at for months now.  But I just want to clarify here, because all this options shit is still very new to me and if I understand this whole covered call thing correctly, it almost sounds too good to be true.  So, if you own 100 shares of, let's say, AMC, you can just sell covered calls on it week after week, and that's basically GUARANTEED income as long as you own those shares?  Like, the worst thing that could happen is that AMC could go bankrupt and suddenly your 100 shares are worthless (which is a risk in buying and holding any stock anyway)?  I mean yeah, I get that you're limiting your potential upside on the value of the stock because if it goes above the strike price, then the option-holder can exercise, and then you're forced to sell the stock at that price and might feel bitter about that if the price goes way higher later on.  But still, if that happens you're still making a profit on the actual trade of the shares (assuming you sold the call OTM), plus the premium that you made from selling the call.  So basically, you can just have a guaranteed steady income stream doing this over and over, unless you're somehow the biggest fuckup in the world and every time you do this, the company goes bankrupt before the option expires?  Or is there some bigger risk here that I'm not seeing?",BattlinBud,11,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nr21l5/blackberry_a_company_with_enormous_potential/h0fv10p/,0.136,0.751,0.113,-0.9109
1137,AMC," You pretty much got it. You just run the risk of missing out on huge surges like this. For example I had AMC covered calls I was playing with and those triggered a while back. I made a profit but obviously missed out on the huge surge this week. However, with that in mind, meme stocks have insane volatility right now meaning people are paying a high premium for really far out of the money weekly calls. So yes you limit your upside, but largely you’re able to secure guaranteed weekly income. I made over 100% between premium sales and the final trigger price. I was ok with that gain. 

I’m by no means an expert, but covered options are a much less volatile way to really learn about options trading rather than yoloing weekly options that risk expiring worthless. I think we’ve all made that mistake trying to learn that way.",skushi08,11,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nr21l5/blackberry_a_company_with_enormous_potential/h0gbfre/,0.127,0.72,0.153,0.5251

1871,BB," So I like BB but a few things worry me.  1. Cylance is fucking garbage, it basically was annihilated by Crowdstrike.  It’s even worse than carbon black and the other competitors in the space.  They sold to BB as an admition of defeat.  In fact, I used to own the cylance desktop version for my gaming pc and it recognized league of legends as a malicious program MID game and deleted my game files…mid game.

A friend was an it manager, used cylance at their enterprise and it also caused programs to not work there.

It’s way to simple and intrusive.  Only decent for shitty products that don’t need real security, so maybe iot and cars.  MAYBE.

The phone intrigues me, but not having blue iPhone texts is like involuntary celibacy nowadays.  Android is a big no no.

1912,BB," Remember when you sell contracts, the attitude is reversed. Buy calls = bullish. Sell naked calls = bearish. Sell covered calls = bearish to certain extent, bullish to certain extent. 

Sell puts = bullish, buy puts = bearish. 

When you sell naked calls/puts, you do not want to be assigned. You want to continuously sell them to collect the premium. 

When you sell COVERED calls, the idea can be mixed. You might want to sell because you hope to get assigned, thus you get strike + premium instead of just the sell revenue. This is bullish. But you also do not want the price to moon too extreme, because then you hand over shares at discount price. (If BB is 20, you sell a $25 contract for $5, you get $10 return when it hits 25 as opposed to just 5. If BB hits 100, you get $10 return, but not a penny more). However, you also do not want the stock to continuously move sideways, because the volatility will drop and you baghold for some time. 

Selling cash-secured puts is like saying ""I am betting the stock will not drop this far!"" However, this could really backfire. If BB is $20, and you sell $15 put for $7, you get $7. If BB is $30, you keep that $7. However, if BB drops to $2, you have to pay my shares for $15 regardless. You hold $2-worth share, at $15-7 = $8 price. 

Similar to naked calls. Play covered calls then long calls/long puts before playing selling puts.",patrickswayzemullet,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nrh0wu/the_bb_resistance_is_a_good_sign_dd_refresher/h0h5xm8/,0.052,0.85,0.098,0.9472

IV is too high. I was playing around alot on AMC with risk profile charts today. The only way it can make sense is through a condor or a butterfly where the premiums will offset each other. But now you have a smaller window to guess where it will be. 

If youre diligent you can try buying puts on the way down. Look for 2 consecutive lower - lows which will be youre bearish signal. Then trade vertical put spreads 1-2 strikes otm.

2077,TV," Okay, idk how I agree with that, because they were told they won't do a season 2 because it wasn't a hit and that things had to change after season one. And I think season one is the weakest. You might have a fond liking for it. And alot of people will, but the money and ratings talk. Season one is dry,  (imo) season 2 really starts to hit the nail on the head with all the season after the characters really develop into their own. I'm sorry if we disagree, but I would suggest people start atleast on season 2. Season one is slow and not as good. And might not catch people and hook them the way season 2 or 3 would. This is completely anecdotal but I started a rewatch 2 weeks ago with my Gf who's never seen it. 3 episodes into season 1 she was clearly not into it so I skipped to season 2, first episode there hooked her and were on season 4 now.  Thing is, you don't miss really anything by skipping season 1 either.

2355,AMC," The Hedgie's and the MM's are getting pretty desperate to pop this thing. AMC CEO made the right decision to raise capital; he wouldn't be retarded enough if he didn't. It's prudent financial management to reinvest and another reason why AMC is going to recover greatly as we re-open. This doesn't even include the 'next-gen' theaters that are being developed to include immersive experiences, ""choose your own adventure"" movies, augmented reality, and 3D video gaming without VR headsets. But I don't know anything about that...... i just ate a crayon! 

#Is AMC about to become the next hot tech stock?

Here's the deal. The Hedgie's used the news about the new infusion of shares to try and pop the bubble by dumping in pre-market and at open. It had an impact, but limited. They are running out of ammunition to stop this runaway train.

There was also the multiplier effect from hedging exposure to ITM calls expiring friday in the range of $50-70. As the price fell, the trading algorithms automatically unwound the hedges against their call exposure as ITM calls went OTM and they no longer had to hold the shares. It started a cascade of 20%, which is small potatoes for shares that were up 100% yesterday. It's a small correction which will lead to 'sideways consolidation' before the next big move up.

Here's the thing. All of those ITM calls that went OTM will go right back ITM as the price recovers. This means the Hedgies will once again have to buy back shares to hedge their exposure to calls that were deep OTM just a few days ago. There is A LOT of call option volume which means there will be tonnes of MM hedging buying up the shares again as the price starts to recover. So, instead of dumping shares into a falling price, they will be forced to buy shares as the price rises. It will have a 'spring multiple' effect, like releasing a beach ball underwater! And again, even OTM shares with low delta need to be hedged as the price rises and the delta rises.

2418,LNG," Actually, he isn't, and LNG is not dying.  A huge amount of Asia is converting from Coal to natural gas for pollution and greening reasons as well as cost.  As their population expands, they are moving further toward natural gas because it is far cheaper than electricity generation.  With it being so abundant here in the US, nations are looking to import for the long haul until future generations of green energy or batteries (that aren't digging up rare elements) are produced at scale to allow those countries to purchase at the price they're paying for LNG now.  For many countries, that will be quite a long way into the future, since many are still using coal as a primary source today.

2458,AMC," A call option is a contract to buy 100 shares at a specific price (called strike price) on a specific date.

When OP bought these, the price of AMC was under $20, so saying ""I will buy a contract to buy 1000 shares AMC at $20 each"" seems a little strange at first if the stock is at (say $13).  But the option contract can fluctuate in price as AMC moves up and down.

The contract went up in value because AMC went up, way past $20, and so OP sold 4 of the contracts before the expiry date (June 18th) and has enough money from the sale of those contracts to execute the remaining 6 contracts (which is pretty safe to do since he is buying 600 AMC shares at $20 each while the price of AMC is over $60)  Executing the option contract is great for everyone because it forces the Market Maker to buy those 600 shares or transfer them from someone who sold the contract to OP.

“And just in case anybody is not aware, this was never supposed to be a weird quasi-gamma play.  Mr. Clean was supposed to be SOLIDLY ITM by this point - as much as 6 or 7 dollars ITM and this was just supposed to be your run of the mill 4 bagger.  But, things since March when IB's started fucking with it being what they are, it somehow turned into an FD with the potential to create instant generational wealth or complete losses.  One of the reasons I've been harping shares over options for so long because it's a good equity in a bad spot.  Wasn't until this week when the options chain fell to .01 that it suddenly turned into a Powerball gamble.  The 13c only turned into such a giant anomaly because it was hovering around that area for a while and the $AMZN deal with warrants @ $13.49 made 13 a natural psychological floor that the IB's somehow broke.

So the most heavily shorted stocks have been at the forefront of this. Currently im reading that WKHS is the most heavily shorted currently and it appears to have been recently increasing.

I’ve been sitting on the stock for about a year and chose it because they seemed like a good enough contender (they must have been halfway good if they were even considered for a contract as large as USPS). While I should have pulled out while I was ahead, my little dig on fairness was only a nod to the investigation into the USPS contract and deal made by Louis DeJoy (who doesn’t have the best track record of acting in the best interest of The USPS).

2906,GM," I was in WKHS last year and made some good money in the run up to the USPS decision. They needed that contract to boost manufacturing. When they lost the contract I sold the rest. Here is why:

1) I work in patents and they have no meaningful patents regarding trucks. Their only patent is regarding the drone (and maybe one dealing with the chassis). It is concerning when a truck manufacturer has no IP regarding trucks. 
2) They have no meaningful manufacturing capabilities. The argument leading up to USPS was Lordstown would lead manufacturing but even Lordstown said they would halve their expected deliveries for the Endurance without additional money. If lordstown doesn't have the money to make their own trucks, how are they going to also manufacture for WKHS?
3) The reason I bought WKHS was because they were supposed to have a head start. But that is not the case anymore. Ford, GM, Rivian are all now ahead of WKHS. 
4) My main reason for avoiding them, which relates to 2) and 3), is they delivered 6 truck in Q1. SIX!!! A company that has been around for 10+ years and was supposedly in the lead delivered just 6 trucks in 3 months. AFTER 10 YEARS AND A SUPPOSED HEAD START THEY DELIVERED ONLY 6 VEHICLES IN 3 MONTHS!!!

I really wanted to support this company, but they lost the contract, lost the head start they once held over other companies, have no IP, have no automated manufacturing, and have very little cash. They've had other non-binding agreements before but have not been able to scale production to meet them. Six trucks in Q1 was my last straw. They will need to sell more shares at some point in order to survive.

If it was that easy ford GMC  Toyota WW would all be killing it tho for some reason most of them are in so much debt it's really unbelievable that people actually invest in them

If you are messing with your retirement money it will allways do better in a safer stock like Tesla if you want to invest in the ev market

Tesla is going to make a lot more millionaires than any company before them 

And is one of very few companies that is so vertically integrated in so many sectors that 
It's just amazing that actually get to have a small part of history 

There are going to be plenty of people that are going to lose a lot of money to because they don't do there due diligence and learn all there is about the company and what there goals are and what they have achieved so far

So when the stock drops like it has been they get scared and sell


Lots of people just go by what main stream media tells them because they are to lazy to actually put the effort in to do the research themselves. And are allways looking for the fast and easy way to get rich

When all they really need to do is just buy and hold for a few years to a decade or more

It truly is the easiest way to make money and if you don't sell then you don't mess up it's idiot proof

2956,AMC," First you need someone who is selling $75 AMC calls. I'm sure market makers will open it as long as the price doesn't crash.

Contract would cost X premium x100.
$67 calls are currently trading at $12, so you would pay $1200 per call contract, paid when you purchase it.

It's already in the money, so if you wanted to get AMC shares for $1 off you could exercise them immediately and pay *$67 multiplied by 100 = $6700 to exercise the contract.

If it goes above the strike price a simple way of thinking about it is(using x=$100 share price):

X - strike price, multiplied by 100 = your profit from selling the contract. So in this case it would be $100 - 67 = $33 x 100 = $3300

This isn't getting into the Greeks and we're hitting the bounds of my knowledge here

I did just see that u/BlackDiamondBear made an incredibly appealing post about CLNE that is getting attention so I am linking that below for your own enjoyment! (If you feel late to the AMC party and want to fuck up some hedge funds, namely CITADEL, give it a read)

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nqte85/ok_apes_this_is_as_simple_as_it_gets_we_had_moass",jbro12345,30,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nqwp72/couldnt_fight_it_34000_to_489000_on_your_favorite/h0dekx1/,0.063,0.725,0.212,0.9932
3152,CLNE," My next position is going to be more calls on ASO (already have almost 2,000 contracts). AMC was fun but I don't want to be holding it when the music stops. I know some of you are fine doing that and I'll say you have bigger balls than me. I may still dabble but it will be in shares with stop losses. How high will it go? Nobody knows. For me ASO is a safe bet and I believe it has a lot of potential upside especially with earnings coming up. I'm not willing to lose my gains, especially after I've already realized them knowing it is always the hardest part of a trade. 

I wish all of you the best of luck and might get downvoted for this, but please cover your initial investment +10%. Unrealized gains turn into realized losses if you don't manage your risk properly. Good luck and I hope you all hit your goal.

3166,IRS," Yep. Any gains you make over a certain amount (I believe it’s $600 but it may have been raised in the last year or so), you pay taxes on, even if you spend it to invest more (aka you never use the money to buy that lambo).

It’s the bad part about short selling and day trading. It’s also why people are encouraged to start practicing and writing everything down. That way you keep better track of what you’re doing and can put money aside. 

As long as he knows which bracket he’s in and saves the percentage he’s going to owe, he will be fine though. It’s just being careful. It’s a felony if the IRS catches you, and they do random checks each year during tax time.

3274,AMC," Retail order flow tends to be very random and clustered.  It often results in disorganized chart patterns.  When large players make moves they tend to do so in waves.  This is because they've learned that execution is more efficient if orders are spaced out to let the limit order book recover.  So it's hard to know when it is happening how much more volume could come but it's very apparent afterwards. Clean moves followed by pullbacks. 

Forced liquidations on the other hand just keep going as they dump the shares a fast as they can.  Price just goes straight up.

3297,SPCE," Let me explain how fucking costly shorting is.

I shorted SPCE after their recent test flight. I predicted that the flight success would cause a spike, and then it'd tank back down as everyone took profits and realised SPCE is still fucking garbage.

I opened two (very cheap) positions, because I'm acutely aware of infinity losses when shorting.

I opened my short positions when SPCE was as $23.94 and $24.10 on May 24th.

It was a set of 10 contracts on each price shorted through CFD means. If you don't know what i'm talking about, all you need to know is that I bet with my broker that SPCE would drop below these prices. I only went small, my initial outlay was around £15 on each set of contracts, on a 1:5 leverage. (my maths might be a tiny bit off, I deleted this play from my brain because it hurt but the detail still stands)

This cost me about £30 to enter these positons. Again, all you need to understand is that I basically 'bet' £30 that SPCE would drop.

The first day it dropped, then it fucking climbed.

In just 4 days, I got called by Marge. The SPCE price had gone from my $24 short positions to around $33. So, an increase of just 35% caused me to get Margin Called. I closed the positions at a huge loss.

This £30 short position cost me £74 and £72 respectively in the space of 4 days.

So, I throw £30 in, and in 4 days I suddenly lose £140, on a 30% stock movement, and I got margin called meaning I had zero chance of recovering those losses unless I put more money in the account....

Now imagine what happens, when a hedge fund, operating on a much greater leverage than a retard like me with a broker, and this hedge fund has put 30 million dollars in. And the stock has risen by 105% in a single fucking day.... You begin to realise why ""holding the line"" is so expensive, it's almost fucking impossible.

Edit - Also, i'm in a better position because i'm CFD shorting. Which means i'm just betting on the price without trading the stock. Actual shorters have to go into the market and buy the stock back, plus they pay a much high interest rate daily than I do, so they have it even tougher than me.

This is all very quick and basic, but basically - shorting a mooning stock is expensive as fuck.",DogeDogeCoins,29,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nqyicj/are_shorts_being_forced_to_close_out_positions/h0dgnvw/,0.071,0.848,0.08,0.5988

3568,BB," Lessons Learned from a stupid Retard:  ok so I had a great plan to buy BB ( which I did) AH @13.23 / 1k shares.  This was a swing trade so I held over night and into the opening the next day.  My plan was to hold and increase my stop limit as the price rose.    Well BB started to dip ( in which I expected but still held). At around the 12.20 mark ( I was down 700) but had confidence the stock would soon rebound.  I decided to order a stop limit at 12.00 just in case the stock bottomed out but instead of a stop limit I mistakenly put in a limit order which sold the stock immediately for. 700 dollar loss,  as soon as the order executed BB spike to 16.23 and since I was on a cash account I could not jump in.

3686,AMC," Lets think about something real quick.  If I shorted 50,000 shares of AMC at $10 and then bought 500 July 16 OTM $25 calls for $1.15 each on May 20 (the first day they were available, at the last price paid on that day) once the price started going up, and my short position got squeezed, would I lose money or make money?

Price yesterday got up to $72.62. That's a loss of $3,131,000.  Let's say I shorted the shares on Friday April 30 at 200% interest.  33 days have elapsed, for periodic interest of 18.08% or interest due of 90,411.  So loss of $3,221,411 on my short position.  Pretend I covered at the very, very top.

But on the options side, I paid $57,500 for my hedge. Reasonable hedge for my $500k original short that was starting to go super awry.  Those options were selling, at the moment I liquidated my shorts and sold my hedge to cover, at $50.00 (somebody really paid that amount).  That would give them a value of $2,500,000.  I am a special boy so I only pay commission of $.30 per contract so 500x2 (open and close) means $300 commissions, for total cost of $57,800.  Total options gain of $2,442,200.

Total P/L on the trade of ($779,211)

That totally sucks but I am sure as shit not bankrupt if I'm a hedge fund with hundreds of millions in assets.

Shoot, even AMC (the corporation) could absorb that loss.",OlyBomaye,11,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nrmh2t/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_june_04_2021/h0hny9d/,0.085,0.769,0.145,0.9461

3781,OI," Yes and No. Open Interest (OI) is what they don't currently have hedged. Their quants would have numbers that tell them, as an example, for this % of strike prices x amount aware of current share price we should hedge x amount of shares. Not everyone is going to execute their calls (if it's just in the money, it's not a huge financial gain) and they might just sell the option near expiry. MM could by call and let it expire (cheaper than buying the stock and doesn't add upward pressure on the share price). But generally higher OI means the MM is going to have to purchase more shares to hedge and this can cause a gamma ramp/squeeze.

3825,AMC," First and foremost, I'm an idiot and not providing any financial advice.  I am quite possibly talking out of my ass and have no real knowledge other than my own, possibly twisted, logic of how things might play out in the future.

I really appreciate this post.  I bought up some shares of AMC months ago and I've been thinking about buying up some more theater stocks to hold for a year or so and see how they do.  People have been locked up for damn near forever now and most of us are really damn excited to be able to go to a theater.  I think that will make theater stocks pretty damn profitable for the next year or so if you can buy in low enough.  They are all going to make money for a good while in the future.

But looking at this, I'm compelled to think.  I think you're right.  If mRNA vaccines turn out to be as effective as we're all hoping, pharmaceuticals is probably a really smart investment right now.  Your post does make it look like $RAD might be a smart buy.  That said, I think $RAD, or other pharmacies, a safe buy.  I think there might be more potential for gain, if mRNA vaccines do turn out to be safe and effective, buying into the stocks of the companies actually producing these vaccines like $PFE (Pfizer) and $MRNA (Moderna.)

Like I said, just my own thoughts based on my own logic.  $RAD is almost certainly something I will buy a few shares in just to diversify my own meager holdings.

But we in debt. We need a savior. Amazon is perfect. 

I already know what’s going to happen. 

Amazon buys us. Rite aid keeps rhe pharmacy part. 

The front end will be an Amazon store front for some. 

Some will just become hubs for delivery. Like a UPS store with a pharmacy(which I wanted to do if I was open to an independent). 

Some will become Whole Foods in the front end.

It’s disgusting how easily Amazon can become a super competitor against Walgreens and cvs over night.
