This is why the government hasn't shut shit down.

It's a better stimulus than 'they' could have ever formulated or legislated.

We're in the right, here. Hold.

I see people critizing the philanthropy, ""Oh but you're not supposed to sell GME, what hypocrisy!""

 Y'all haters ever stop to think that we have a few bucks to spare? Or don't - yet still believe... Shit...

I adopted Iyamarere and his pop on my Amex. WSB, GME, and the confidence I've gained in this sub made it a no-brainer to put $125 on a card to hook our brothers and sisters up.

If GME tanks tomorrow, fuck it, we donated half a million to conservation charities on a whim.

Tomorrow marks 21 days since the price jumped from 40 to 90. That jump put a lot of calls ITM. Those calls have 21 days to get filled. That means any naked call that was filled on 2/24 have to be purchased by tomorrow. This is the moment we've been talking about they have to buy it at the price we pick. This is the moment that the gamma squeeze takes shape. We've done a great job of hodling and buying dips to keep the price up. But it has to keep going. There will be short attacks today and tomorrow. There will be paper hands selling. It's on us apes to do what we set out to do and screw the HFs. And please understand: now that we've gotten to the 21 day mark, and did a great job of holding the line for the past few weeks, each new day forces even more naked calls to be covered. This is the gamma squeeze, and it's launch time.

Please, for the love of all apes, do not sell. Buy the dips. We're going to take this stock to the moon, but it starts with us.

In all seriousnessness though, The long and short of this appears to be that there is much fuckery where there was not supposed to be such fuckery.  The market is too convoluted and its time for some legislation to return it to a point at which ""HFs buy the shares they short on the open market and therefore should be more cautious in what company they elect to short"". 

Thanks for the education.  Honestly, my brain is way too smooth to adequately process all this but I do understand supply and demand.  If they want my shares, by all means, they can make an offer.

If the ETF shares borrowed, can’t be located and returned by the HF, is there some fuckery where the ETF can rebalance with less GME, the HFS don’t need to return the shares, just pay a cash premium or pay for the difference?

I am always worried this ETF loophole is a way for them to avoid buying a real share (driving the price up) and they end up just paying cash to the ETF after they rebalance with less shares

Long answer: I didn’t see any tickers in OPs post, so I’m going to generalize and say the ETFs mentioned are passive funds tracking an index. In general, these funds loan out shares to help cut fees - it’s how you can buy Vanguard finds or w/e at a fee of 0.07%. Passive funds by nature are just really agnostic.

 ETF 1 is IWM.

GME is .51% of the ETF  https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239710/ishares-russell-2000-etf

2 million shares of IWM at $234 is $468,000,000. .51% of that is $2,386,000 of GME. Divided by $280 per share of GME is ... drumroll please ....**8370** shares of GME

ETF 2 is XRT. Actually shares available jumped right back to 1.5M at 10 AM yesterday so there’s no real evidence that HFs shorted it at all (I mean I’m sure they did! HFS short and guy things every day. There’s just zero way to tell this by looking at IBKR data)

BUT let’s say we agree, HFs shorted 450,000 shares of XRT yesterday in order to synthetically short GME. How many shares of GME are in that?
450,000 shares of XRT at $95 (yest morning) = $42.75M. GME is approx 15% of XRT (I’m generously estimating because it’s 12.4% today but the stock fell yesterday) meaning it’s $6.4M of that exposure. Divided by $280 (approx price yest morning) = **22,900 shares**

So OP wrote a long post with lots of pretty pictures to say that GME fell yesterday because a HF shorted about **30,000** shares or $8.8M of GME through ETFs.

397,GME," If this is true, the apes are probably fucked. I speculated on this back in early Feb - specifically, the Market will not let a stock price hit a divide by zero error. At some point, the SEC steps in, halts trading on GME, puts all the shares and shorts on the table, and names the price at which all lenders are made whole, voiding all current stock. The company then re-issues stock and set a special horizon for shorting (i.e. for 24 months new shares may not be lent or sold short). 

The government will not bail out the hedgies, the current stockholders will. When the SEC sets the settlement amount, they're not going to choose $69,420/share. They're likely to set it at something like a $100*, claiming that no rational investor would value the company above $7B, or a book ratio of around 20 (and using its historic P/B of <2, and online retail sector avg of around 18-19 as a warning not to challenge it). Melvin and Citadel pay up and take more massive losses but remain solvent, and anyone who bought in over $100 takes a bath. 

There will be (more) SEC and Congressional hearings about shorts and they will commission a study from Harvard. The study will take long enough to compile that the general public will forget about this, the SEC will have a 2 paragraph announcement that they've properly scolded the hedge funds and that, in the words of Sen Susan Collins, ""They've learned their lesson,"" and no action needs be taken.

433,GME," >  Why don't you let us exit out of this position, we'll throw you a couple billion your way to pay for our mistake

I understand what you're saying is possibility, and it's hard fus us as 'outsiders' from retail to know if/how any alliances are set between HF's. But I don't think it's probable that they will help each other survive (unless they're in same position balls deep in GME short positions)

It's more speculation and like I said I do think there might be alliances, but I think only on a 'the enemy of my enemy is my friend' opportunity base. As hedgefunds live on opportunity base I wouldn't be surprised if the HF's who aren't balls deep into shorting GME would see this as an opportunity to bleed HF's in short positions dry (more tendies for themselves, plus potential bonus if the short position HF goes bankrupt they'll have less competition and tendies from short HF having to liquidate the assets) and if government might bailout the HF's in short positions (even more additional tendies). Of course it's complex game with a lot of pieces still on the board, this is also not sourced basically just speculation from my own pov. It will be interesting to watch how this plays out

Three things that I like most about Revolut:

- the government has no insights into revolut accounts and revolut doesn't care if you pay taxes for it or not.

- transfering money between investment part of the app and your banking/wallet is super simple and takes just a second.

- you can pay with the app anywhere (virtual card or physical card) so you can spend my tendies without government asking questions.

Melvin and Citadel would be gone, but so would everybody else. No, the other competing funds absolutely do not want GameStop at a crazy high price if it means all their other holdings are complete trash overnight.

Can WSB really not see that a completely runaway GME is no different than a catalyst atom kicking off a nuclear meltdown?

There is zero chance whatsoever that, at best, GME will be allowed more than a few thousand before the SEC or Treasury Department halts trading on it and a share buyback price is determined.

540,AI," Let's say you as a country want to invest in mental health or universal healthcare to save money over time in terms of addiction and crime as well as other interconnected issues and/or improve quality of life. If you don't have the budget for it, it takes far longer to implement if you're not using a fiat currency to take out debt and thus you spend more money over time trying to fix these issues. 

Also with automation reducing wages over time you're eventually going to have to find a way to supplement wages if you want quality of life to increase for the average person and as far as I know thats far easier to do with fiat currency, if you want to keep a market based economy that is. 

Look at the roman empire and how they gradually debased their currency because they ran out of silver and started ""watering down"" their currency by putting less silver in it. Unless you're suggesting that we invade other countries to sustain near exponential currency growth to accommodate exponential market growth due to continous technological innovation I don't see any other option.

Most empires fell when their economies could no longer sustain imperial expansionism to accumulate more currency to sustain growth. The problem isn't fiat currency it's the mismanagement of currency that causes these issues, especially when it comes to being able to truly evaluate what a company, service, housing, etc. is truly worth. 

That's easier with non fiat currency but it still has the issue of limited cumulative value of all buisnesses within the country, you'd need more of said precious resource to add value to your country after all and any system that would circumnavigate this issue with non fiat currency will have the same issues to fix as fiat. 

It would honestly be better to eventually have an AI manage the economy in terms of what everything is worth, the only issue there is insuring that the parameters of what something is worth reflect human based values as well as market based ones or we'll be heading back to the 1800s in terms of life quality for the poorest among us.",DexHexMexChex,7,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m68855/always_remember_mark_baums_words/gr5jq94/,0.037,0.825,0.138,0.9834

573,GME," I'm trying to figure something out:

When Robinhood halted the buying of GME but not the selling, who were the sellers selling to? Surely there needed to be a buyer buying from those sellers for the sale to happen?

If Robinhood didn't have any more shares of GME to lend for short selling, then wouldn't it be the other way around, halting people from opening short sell positions until Robinhood recouped back shares?

Or was it Robinhood itself buying those shares from the sellers, since nobody else could buy at that time?

Changing the business model at the very least saves some of those jobs since not all stores are being taken away (or at least they will transformed into something else supposedly).

I am no expert but borrowing 600M 45 days or so after coughing up 2.8B for those idiots at Melvin, doesn't instill confidence in Citadel's cash flow situation. I don't want to bleed them to death.  I want to rip out each major artery one by one until they are so utterly devoid of blood, not even one more drop can be squeezed from them with a steamroller.  Don't attack my childhood friends!  Ya might not like what sort of response that stirs up.

768,GME," Look  
If you save  
One cat  
In the WSB community  
And gave him everything he ever wanted  
Would you nurture him?  
And just buy the dip?  

Yo  
His paws are sweaty,  
tail’s weak, fur is heavy  
Pukes varmint on your sweater already  
Ratatouille  
He’s earned this,  
Though on the surface. 
He looks like he’s betting  
He drops bombs  
And he keeps on dub-dippin’  
But he’s woke now  
This lil guy wants to prowl  
He opens his mouth  
But he can’t say “Meow”  
He’s chokin’ how?  
Somethin in his throat comes out  
This cat runs out, winds up, yells: BUY NOW!!

Cat’s back to reality  
You’ve showed him humanity  
Oh, there’s a short squeeze;  
he poached  
He kissed back,  
But he won’t give up that easy, No.  
He won’t have it,  
He knows you’re a poor guy with hopes  
And you matter.  
You’re dope.  
He knows that  
and you’re broke.  
He’s so jacked that you chose  
To watch him back in your mobile home  
Thats when he’s glad you’re a friend to him, yo  
This whole lap petting  
Better go capture this moment,  
And post it on reddit  

You cannot choose yourself  
when the stock dips  
You vomit  
You own it  
You better never let it go  
You only gets one shot  
To trade pennies for a home  
This opportunity only comes with nine lifetimes  

He rolls a play thing  
Your wife’s over: she’s gaping  
This ball is his for the playing  
Fuzzy rings  
As he moves toward her  
Crawls by her shoulder  
Her newfound owner is more than  
A super star; his post is all over  
It only grows larger  
Only grows hotter  
He blows r/all over  
These golds is all on him  
Coast to Coast grows  
He’s known as the Tardfather  
Lonely post, doG only knows  
He’s grown farther from home  
He’s your father  
He goes home  
and bathes your wife in some water   
She curls her toes cut she hates when it’s hotter    
They moved in to the next room;  
watched shows  
His toes scrunched,  
She blows on him  
So the soap opera is told and unfolds  
They’ve become old partners  
Their heart beat is one  
Da da dum da dum da da  

You cannot choose yourself

Buy more Game  
With my change, second mortgage, yay  
Tear this muthafuckin coupon  
Like Papier-mâché  
I was playing, and we be grinning  
The mood all changed  
We were chewed out  
Kicked out  
By establishment’s gags  
But we kept climbing our steps  
Gamma squeeze: it gets higher  
Buy down the ladder real fast like a tiger  
All the fun inside amplified by the  
Fact that this cats got lives,   
I’m talkin’ nine bruh  
Lives. And I still provide the right type of  
Hype for my kitten    
Cuz man  
These dogdamn  
Food stamps Fill our diapers  
And it’s a movie,  
I’ll show you my smile  
This is our life.  
And these times are so hard  
And it’s gettin even harder  
Trying to beat and slaughter,  
their greed; plus  
See, your honor; not a kitten  
Man can take my wife n daughter  
Steamed Vlad just like a sauna  
Baby mama, He’s feedin me enough  
For me to want this cat in my stuff:  
Another can de-topped  
Has gotten me to the point  
Where this sub of spam can rot  
The formula shake is hot  
From sitting in a copper pot. 
Caress this mother lovin’ kitten option
Saucer’s not
Cat I love you  
And this sub gave me a bro  
I can now grow old, with you, my rock  
So here we go, buy the stock.

781,AMC," For what it's worth, I never looked at AMC as a meme stock. Pre-pandemic I wasn't sure what the future of movie theaters was. But after the last year, people want to go out and do things in person. People want to go to the movies again. 

You've had some real flops on the direct to streaming front. (I suspect Wonder Woman would have done a lot better in a theater.) You've had so many blockbusters held back for late 2021 or 2022. A lot of areas aren't open yet. Give it a few more months and you'll really see things take off.

967,GME," My posts showing the LVL2 on GME keep getting kicked by the automods. Is anyone else seeing the order book is filled with the same lot sizes on the buy and sell side? Example, right now the number is 55. It's been through the 40s and 50s all day.

When the price starts to go up, the book will fill from top to bottom with 55 share lots spaced a few cents apart, and all below the current ""normal"" ask. Then the buy side fills with those same sized lots, churning the price down a few cents at a time. It certainly looks like they're just selling to themselves, then recycling those bought shares back over to the sell side and doing it over and over again. With a few hundred thousand shares you could keep the price in your desired ""window"" all day. You'll lose a few getting bought by regular traders, but in general you're keeping your share count.

I've been seeing this for a while, but not to the extent of today. Can anyone confirm or deny that this is what is happening?",chiefoogabooga,52,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m6bmld/diamond_hand_veteran_here_i_held_gme_from_january/gr4rywm/,0.026,0.892,0.082,0.6767

The way they're doing that is with naked price manipulation, as seen in the pump and dump last week. Technical analysis is the only correct way to make any play in this environment besides a hold.

I don't think it's accurate to say the true value of a stock is higher than the market price, just because there are a lot of people unwilling to sell at the current price. There are also a lot of people unwilling to buy at the current price, so you could make the argument the other way. Everyone in the market has a different opinion, and the exchange finds a sort of consensus price by matching buyers with sellers. By being unwilling to sell at the current price, you're actually increasing it slightly compared to if you sold, so your opinion is already reflected in the consensus.

JUST INSTITUTIONS HOLD 115%. Well, retail does have stocks as well..

&#x200B;

1st pic:

We can see a INCREASE of BUYERS and DECREASE of SELLERS. More buying people, less selling people -> GOOD FOR APES

Besides this, we can actually see that the percentage of Float Held increased aswell. But thats it for the first slide. Nothing to add, no big changes to my last Bloomberg post (THAT'S WHY A MASSIVE PRICE DROP LIKE TODAY IS UNLIKELY AND UNEXPLAINABLE).

PLEASE look at the bottom right where it clearly says that really NO ONE decreased or increased their positions, NOT EVEN RETAIL INVESTORS (Investment Advisor, Individual, Private Equity, Brokerage). REALLY NO ONE SOLD!!!

2nd pic:

As we can see theres no recently reported data (look at the dates and don't panic when seeing red numbers on the picture) BESIDES the Teachers Insurance just taking some profits since they're obviously not willing to take any risk (its their fucking insurance I would'nt gamble it in Gamestop aswell, they hodld until now and are taking profits -> totally fine, no really big position -> Also no explanation why the price did drop as it did today)

3rd pic:

On the 3rd picture we can see all important Call options expiring on March 19th. HUGE VOLUME if price is above 200$ on March 19th. Even more volume than on 210$/250$/300$.

4th pic:

Sadly we can see that more people trading options are betting in decreasing stock prices of Gamestop. But how can that be good in any way? As you can see do ALMOST ALL OF THEM bet on the price being UNDER 200$ BY MARCH 19th. If the price is above 200$ til March 19th ALL PUTS IN THIS AREA WILL EXPIRE WORTHLESS !!

TLDR:

NO ONE, REALLY NO ONE INCREASED OR DECREASED THEIR POSITION MASSIVELY!! But how did the price drop happen? You may ask. Well, although GME may be on the SSR list IT DOESN'T MEAN THE HFs ARE NOT ABLE TO SHORT THE STOCK! That's a huge mistake people are partially spreading.

There's really NO PROOF THAT RETAIL OR OTHER INSTITUTIONS SOLD THEIR POSITIONS!

IMO: JUST ANOTHER SHORT LADDER ATTACK TRYING TO SCARE YOU AND AN ATTEMPT TO EXECUTE YOUR STOP LOSSES AT SPECIFIC PRICE RANGES. I saw today as a GREAT BUYING OPPORTUNITY and bought even more stocks.

Sadly we can see that more people trading options are betting in decreasing stock prices of Gamestop. But how can that be good in any way? As you can see do ALMOST ALL OF THEM bet on the price being UNDER 200$ BY MARCH 19th. If the price is above 200$ til March 19th ALL PUTS IN THIS AREA WILL EXPIRE WORTHLESS !!

TLDR:

NO ONE, REALLY NO ONE INCREASED OR DECREASED THEIR POSITION MASSIVELY!! But how did the price drop happen? You may ask. Well, although GME may be on the SSR list IT DOESN'T MEAN THE HFs ARE NOT ABLE TO SHORT THE STOCK! That's a huge mistake people are partially spreading.

There's really NO PROOF THAT RETAIL OR OTHER INSTITUTIONS SOLD THEIR POSITIONS!

Plenty of documentation on it and how naked shorts and FTD's were used to create  the last few collapses. Go check out Judd Bagley's channel on YT.

&#x200B;

If someone makes 100 of X and sells to investors and yet 120 X are floating around, clearly there is fraud. If the SM is full of fraud it is not efficient, in fact, it is hugely destructive. Imagine if you could use the SM as your own personal bank.

There is no way for over 100% owned to ever be reconciled. If X can't actually be created out of thin are then there is no way to ever get it down except for the frauds to buy back 20 of X and then somehow ""lose"" them in the dark.

1158,GME," Depends on why you're holding. If you're holding to inflict max pain theory on a group of hedge funds, you want a higher price than 1k to set an example to the other funds. If you're holding to make money, you want to hold for as high a price as possible and setting expectations if a 1k peak isn't nearly as much money made as selling at 10k (or 500k). Some people genuinely just like holding the stock and there is a good chance that after this is all said and done after the squozening they'll just hold it until they pass on their shares to their wife's boyfriend's grandchildren.

The hedge funds are in a position where they will be required to buy the millions of shares they borrowed and sold. They don't get to set the price, Jim Cramer doesn't set the price, everyone holding GME sets the price. You (if you're holding) get to set the price.

I have never owned stock in my life before this GME thing the whole stock market thing was not interresting to me at all. But i have learned so much in the past three months.

The weird / unique thing with GME is, there not a whole lot of shares available.

The company bought back so many shares, the float is a very small numer.

With all the exposure there is now world wide demand for GME shares. 

The drops in price every now and then are very sus, Escpecially if you look at the volume.

Shares still fail to deliver daily and with every manipulation GME stays in the news and people buy more on the dips. Holding my 5 GME shares tightly costs me nothing.

Someone will have to hold the bag on this one. The stock isn’t worth $300 and it will drop to around $100 or below before picking up steam from the actual changes. This was all due to a squeeze that may or may not have happened. A real WSB user isn’t an Ape. He’s a gambler, and to be a good gambler you have to know when to hold and when to fold.

 If someone here was sending out emails and paying for ads to do specific things then yes that is manipulation and is banned from WSB. Posting an opinion on a PUBLIC forum is not market manipulation. Telling someone to buy and hold isnt market manipulation (that is a core feature of investing - everyone should be doing that).  Even posts explaining why options can cause gamma squeeze isnt market manipulation.

1211,GME," I know Bill Gross a little bit IRL, PIMCO is a west coast firm. I used to drive 45 min from my shitty apartment to bartend at a country club near his primary residence. I still see him about once a year around the holidays, because I occasionally go to parties at the club as a +1 with one of my old co-workers. The longer-tenured club employees get to bring a guest. 

He's a lot of things. Probably not very popular in here. I used to talk options trading with him and he'd always check out my shitty gain/loss porn whenever I wanted to show him my phone. He'd let me know if a stock I was trading was on his list, and whenever I'd ask what his stake was, he'd just smile and stop talking until I brought up another trade. Was moody at times, would outright tell me to shut up if he was doing something else but I take that kind of shit in stride, he never meant it in a ""mean"" way or whatever, he's just a man about his business. 

One thing I can say for him is he's a gamer for sure. Very competitive and confident. I even like the guy, though I have no idea about his business history other than the marquee name PIMCO. 

There's really not a whole lot to this story aside from:

1) I know for a fact he's laid eyes on at least a couple WSB DDs from \~2016/2017 timeframe. I know because they were on my phone. He didn't read them super carefully or anything, but would occasionally ask like ""Who is this?"" and I'd just say ""some guy from the internet"". He must have (rightfully) been a little concerned for me.

2) I can't wait to show him my gain porn after GME goes up. IDK if he will even remember me cuz I didn't see him last year with COVID etc. But I'll mention this article to him.

You might make a YOLO and lose everything. You might make a couple of calls, and tendies just are somehow attracted to your face.

1420,BB," What you need to understand about blackberry is that if they fired all of their employees and sat on their asses for the next five years they'd still make hundreds of millions just off their patents 
Blackberry was the precursor to the modern smartphone  and holds a lot of patents on smartphone tech that are still relevant and will be for some time. 

But they aren't stupid. They knew they were done in the smartphone landscape when their clicky touchscreen phone launched in like 2010? Idk it was that big thing and when you pushed the screen it clicked down. Apparently it sucked, I never had one. 
But anyway, they learned from their mistake and instead invested in what they saw to be some of the next big developments in tech and innovation: namely cyber security, autonomous vehicles, smart cities, etc.

I met a BB recruiter in 2016 at a job fair that gave me the best free pen I've ever received and told me how BB was trying to shift their public perception from a defunct smartphone maker to a cyber security firm.

1497,DD," Theoretically, yes this thing could go into 6 or even 7 digits per share, but realistically theres a point where it is not feasible anymore. To me, the point where it gets to woo-woo land is $10,000 + , where the market cap gets into trillions of dollars. AKA the shorts would have to cover trillions of dollars worth of stock, but they legitimately dont have that much capital in the bank or other assets. I think 1k is for sure doable, along with anything after that up until 10k, but imo after 1k is where we start seeing reality take more of a hold.

But shit if we could hit like 25k a share I wouldn't be complaining. Have 42 shares as of yesterday.

Edit: Did some of my own DD, realized its more feasible than I thought. I am pretty fuckin' retarded, and confirmed again that numbers are not my specialty (market cap @ 10k is lil over half a trillion, not trillions.) My new cap per share is around 50k because at that point its worth almost 3.5 trillion, which means the DTCC would have to insure our shares because hedgies couldn't cover this. Someones comment claims the DTCC  insures up to 57 trillion, but if the DTCC has to dole out 3.5 trillion in insurance and they only have 49 billion in assets, then someone else would have to be footing the bill.

BUTTTTT the people who insure that we would get our tendies at 100k a share if you sold is the DTCC, who could insure it up to 57 trillion if I am not mistaken  (Melvin and Citadel combined would only be able to cover around $50 Billion, so the DTCC would have to step in). This is where I get confused though, because who's money is being posted by the DTCC to insure our shares (if they are sold) @ 100k hypothetically? Can't figure that part out, which to me is vital. If its money the Fed insures then that is taxpayers money, so our tax dollars would pay a bailout twice the size of our federal spending from 2019 alone = hurts the little guy. The DTCC alone cannot insure this amount because they only have assets worth 49 billion.

This is only correct, if you look at the buy side. There are two persons involved though: someone is selling those calls. By selling a call, you collect a premium and hope your call won't get assigned. If the option expires OTM, you make money - the premium. If your call will be assigned, the potential risk is unlimited. If you don't own the stock, you have to buy it at current market price.

Same goes for Puts. By selling a put, you are actually bullish on the stock.

1533,GME," I can't technically lose ""my"" money, because I'm playing entirely on previous gains (made $61k so far this year) and also I don't even hold GME at the moment. I've planned to buy in, so I'm looking on price development from opposite side for some time. It's no defense to say ""$100k"" is an arbitrary number too, when you can't back up the $100. I think it's common understanding that infinity squeeze is an event with a chance of happening close to zero. Looking at the chart, there's support on $180 and $140 which both would need to get wrecked before dumping as far as $100 and $180 support did already immediately rebound to $212 today. Given that MACD doesn't look great, but stimmies are am impactful event that might reset the velocity to positive until Gamstop breaks silence. You've paper handed for profit - good for you that's fine. But now you're spreading baseless FUD, damaging the psychology and thus stock price development for the remaining apes.

GME is retail right now. Wall Streets gives it a 3x multiplier on revenue. Chewy and other Ecommerce companies get way higher multipliers for making less money. 5x-9x   


GameStop can also leverage this position to get out of debt, debt they barely have even now. They sell off part of their retail, pay off their 500m in debt and that can happen this year.  


Now you grow into a space that is $200B+ market cap called video games and you already have a 60m membership group. You already have some retail and by leveraging your turned around company you start buying your warehouses, not leasing, and get into ecommerce.   


Now you have a company with no debt, owning their buildings, valued appropriately.  


In a few years you could see GME worth $90B with 70m shares out there. $1200/share   


The key is being labeled ecommerce and not retail and being valued differently right off the bat. The second big key is being a year after a new generation console release.

Click watchlist > your security (AMC in my case) > trade > click the right arrow on limit to “trailstop” > choose the quantity (100% in my case) > click +\- and choose 10% > expand conditions > set a cancel timeframe in the future (3 months) > confirm

Once it’s done you should have a wait stop order that says sell 100% at -10% Mark. Plus, if you go to the graph screen of the security itself you’ll see a purple line that shows your trailing stop.

1633,AMC," I like exiting 100% to minimize loss. I just responded to a fellow wsb member about what percentage it takes to return to your positions time high after 10%, 20% down to 90% drops from the high. If you do the math, it only takes 11.11% for a drop of 10% but for a 90% drop it takes 900% to return to your original position. 

The lesson is simple: set your trailing stop loss at -10% for all long positions. Then it only takes a 11.11% return to regain your position. Don’t bag hold as things fall out. If you really like the stock wait and buy back in after the dip.

Then tells brokers who work with Rocket that they will not be able to use UWMC because Rocket's practice is basically cutting them out of mortgages. Then Rocket says UWMC is scared because they are losing market share, and by agreeing to UWMC, you won't be able to work with Rocket in the future and may impact the broker because Rocket is doing cool things.

For the first, if you're short GME and the price is lower, it looks less risky, getting $600mm in bonds also makes you more capitalized. You therefore pay less into the Clearing Fund.

1783,BB, BB is a good company on paper with a lot of potential. Their EV software has huge potential. But sadly BB got tied heavily into the meme stocks and it messed it up. The price was inflated for quite a while and bounced a lot because of it. It also continues to bounce. I thing it’s not a $11 stock yet but can get there and beyond. I would wait for dips as tech stocks drop (they will) and try to get shares at under $10. Anything in the $9 range feels too low for BB right now but it will get there again when people move out of tech as they panic over the market.,Radthereptile,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m5x5o5/my_first_dd_post_about_blackberry/gr2r1uw/,0.111,0.836,0.053,-0.7876

Chances are the hedge funds that were short GME are now long with retailers. How did they do it? Let’s say HF were short 1 mil. shares. They can go to the options market to buy 10,000 ITM call options to cover their original short positions AND additional 10,000 ITM call options, which would then put them in net long positions on GME. This then puts the market maker who sold naked call options on the hook.

1803,GME," That is probably a safe approach. Normal circumstances would place this stock at $155 by Friday and we should all be creating options positions to capitalize on that, but that simply hasn't been what has happened. I started this exercise precisely to try to profit on the disparity between minimum exposure and current share price. I did fairly well when it was on the down side of things. 

Back on 2/12, the minimum exposure for 2/19 was 78, 2/26 was $66, 3/5 was $90, 3/12 was $65, and 3/19 was $100. GME was at around $50 so I went all in figuring that the net incentives of the market makers was to get the price to those levels. 

I chose wisely, but that also brings caution as to where we stand now. The same forces that might have pumped the stock the week after 2/19 might be tamping things down now, but the difference here is that there are more tools available to them to make the the stock go up than there are to make the stock go down.",Unlucky_Falcon1754,12,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m6a6kw/3162021_gme_open_interest_report/gr4rk0p/,0.0,0.896,0.104,0.9552

1807,GME," It looks like that what was happening the middle of last week until those rich funds pulled the plug. They still have their own profit targets and they hit whatever target they set for themselves.

They may make a run for themselves, but I also recognize the weaknesses of this analysis that I list in the end. In short, there isn't a single guy whose short all of these positions. Most market makers are hedging themselves right away either with shares on hand or by creating long options positions elsewhere. 

The interesting thing I noticed is that for most stocks, the ""minimum exposure point,"" which is basically the price for each option series where the total short exposure is the smallest, is usually really close to the closing share price--like it is always the next strike (either up or down) away from the share price. 

GME has not behaved that way for at least 6 weeks I've been looking at it so I figured something else was going on and started posting on reddit to get feedback. 

So long story short, I would agree with you that one way to look at this is that GME could get pushed down to $155 by Friday, $100 by April 16, $90 by July 16, and $70 by Jan. 21, 2022. But that simply hasn't happened yet.

1810,GME, I wonder how was tesla handled by MM because in a way it was a simliar situation where you have die hards buying up the stock and holding. So every week the MM would have gamma exposure.

 Surely, you aren't another hedgebot idiot who wants to *pretend like Robinhood had NO CLUE* that their deposit requirement was going to be raised.

 If you believe they had NO CLUE that they would soon have to raise their deposits, then you are too stupid to be criticizing anyone else. 
 
  If you have a brain, surely you e put together that they knew ahead of time what the expected deposit requirements would be, and how they would be raised.  

  And the manipulation was in them choosing to do nothing till the DTCC was forced to act. 

 You do realize the way things normally works is that brokers voluntarily increase their deposits in real time without having to be ordered to do so. 

 And for those of us who were unlucky enough to have a Robinhood account, I still there the first email they sent out when they chose to halt buying ONLY on over a dozen stocks. 

 That email spoke only of *protecting me* from the big bad dangerous market. 
 NO mention of DTCC deposits, nada. 

 RH has lied about their liquidity, lied about the situation in the moment, as it was happening and after the fact as well.  Their reasoning for the actions has continually changed.   
  
  Your post wreaks of fanboy marketing.    RH is a corporation out to make money, that fucks over their users with arguably the worst execution prices of any broker.   

  They are undefendable.
