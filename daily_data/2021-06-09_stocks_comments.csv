33,IMO, Nothing “happened” to Akamai. They are still IMO the leader. They still do much of the heavy lifting on the Internet.

So others have stepped in to fill the void and service the smaller companies that Akamai does not want to deal with.

34,IP," __**Never mind, disregard this whole post, didn’t realize they were also in cloud services as well**__

>! Yes, agreed, I am a developer and am going to explain how it could go down fast though. 

Fastly is a service that host static assets like JavaScript (client), css, images, and other things that are static. 

Although it will take a while for this to happen, a lot of these companies (especially Amazon) will eventually switch to something more uniform with what they already use, like AWS. 

Amazon, reddit, and more already depend on some cloud provider like Google Cloud or AWS. A lot of these companies are also simplifying there “stack”.

A stack is there currently used technologies. 

Although it may be up in the near future, it could go down fast. 



If you want to invest in something like Fastly that has a better future (my opinion), invest in Cloudflare (NASDAQ:NET). I say this because Cloudflare is a DNS manager

DNS is what converts domain names to IP addresses. 
Like: Amazon.com -> xxx.xxx.xx.xx

Although it seems like a minor thing, Cloudflare is only growing and will only grow considering they are so much easier and better than alternatives like Namecheap DNS, or Google DNS.

It is true that Akamai is generally unapproachable to smaller Shops there are no pricing plans at less than about $1000 a month minimum.

There is a workaround through IBM and I use that for my own and client sites you only pay for usage and there is no minimum but the ordering is done through IBM cloud and there are some features not available And there’s no handholding and support comes through IBM not directly from Akamai.

39,AAPL," - These features are hardware locked (web versions of FaceTime are ""receive only"") and require Apple hardware to properly use

- These new features are inferior to Facebook's ""WhatsApp"" product which has had these features for half a decade or longer. WhatsApp web can do more today than Apple's web product will be able to do tomorrow and next year and probably the year after that. 

- Facebook is built on data and connections, Apple is built on hardware and isolation. 

Apple will never challenge Facebook for the same reason why Apple will never compete with Google in Search.

People use Facebook for the connections. To be connected to something larger than their Contact Book. The average Facebook user does not want a Social Network inside of their Instant Message app. They want to follow Meme pages and share it around and see globalized personalized content. 

It's not in Apple's DNA to compete in this space. Apple would have to give up on Privacy to compete with Facebook. The Facebook product is inherently unprivate. Little gimmicks like pinning notes in an instant message app change literally nothing.

If they want to invent the next ""Google Circles"" or whatever the next failed social network is, good luck, but Apple's special sauce is far from this arena.

From a stock perspective, I would be very worried as a AAPL owner to see them try to take Facebook on in social. They will fail.",borkthegee,13,/r/stocks/comments/nvktu5/apple_is_encroaching_on_facebooks_territory_like/h155apd/,0.074,0.883,0.043,-0.678

41,AAPL," Yup. After years of Facebook users using the same services, with ingrained habits, I’m sure these new bleeding edge capabilities will lead them to uproot the workflow for everyone involved in that video chat they had planned.

“Wait, here, let me find the link for a completely different service.”

“Wait, let’s try this whole FaceTime functionality…you do run iOS, right? As far as I remember you had an iPhone…no? Oh, well go to the Play store and let’s spent the next 10 minutes getting you set up with an account for a platform you don’t even use.”

“Hey Grandma, I know you’re just getting used to Zoom, but I hear FaceTime has all these new features.”

>	They will also be able to use a new feature called SharePlay, which lets you hold a FaceTime call and watch a streaming movie, listen to music, or share your screen with your contacts. 

So, not revolutionary in the least, all catch-up to where other services have been for years.

Look, I’m typing this on an iOS device. I hold AAPL. I think they build good products with a solid OS, and they continue to trample Android like they have for years. But this is literally like seeing that the new version of iOS has new emojis for something or other — which might actually literally be more welcome news than “we’re trying to compete in the video collaboration space, right as the dust of COVID is settling!”",InitializedVariable,1,/r/stocks/comments/nvktu5/apple_is_encroaching_on_facebooks_territory_like/h14tcws/,0.0,0.899,0.101,0.9721

65,TV," I can’t be alone in thinking Tik Tok’s
Shelf life is almost 100% dictated by how long before they fully monetize and and ads overtake mindless consumption of a dedicated core of users.

Instagram’s curated aspirational social performance has staying power because you’ll never want to delete a photo that was the highlight of a $3,000 vacation or a $700 concert.

Ads neatly fit in as people also drift away from posting their actual life and focus in on a singular topic which they’d like to be known for. 

Stories allow glimpses into the “artists” life but it disappears and doesn’t ruin the aesthetic of a page.

Nothing Apple is introducing will fuck with IG.

Snapchat I believed had staying power because sometimes we want to communicate without the baggage of a lifelong record.

Apple is looking to bring that functionality into iMessage. Which I can’t wait for… especially if you can split a contact into two types of communication somehow. 

I think millions of people are afraid to even sext their husbands and wives because our devices are too linked. A photo of your tits could be simultaneously seen on a TV, a watch, a desktop, a tablet… even in a house without kids that’s just too much digital scrubbing to worry about and make sexy. 

Of course beyond sexting it would be nice to be free from permanent records, but not all the time…

I don’t think it’s useful either to have your only permanent records to be “I love you” and things that need to be remembered like a grocery list.

The other platform that to me makes the most sense for cannibalization is YouTube.

Apple has been the defacto standard for curated paid artists since iTunes. 

YouTube is becoming less and less the place to store a video of your co-worker doing some dumb shit and everyone in your circle and 30k strangers find hilarious. 

Instead it’s professional content producers who provide niche service and information.

Whether it be FloatPlane, Patreon, or Onlyfans people are wanting to cut through bullshit and get that high-grade content, reward creators, and never hear another ad.

Enter Apple. 

They already provide the tools to create and  edit content. Why not provide the infrastructure of AppleTV and change the nature of Apple’s foray into streaming.

I was thinking, even something as simple as the fact that rather than always having to stream every single thing. A creator could make their videos available for download and the consumer now has a video file that’s actually usable, editable, offline, and works in the entire ecosystem of Apple hardware and software. 

For things like Recipes… that would be a game changer.",rebeltrillionaire,60,/r/stocks/comments/nvktu5/apple_is_encroaching_on_facebooks_territory_like/h14rcpt/,0.091,0.806,0.104,0.7511

They're targeting developing countries with lacking infrastructure to act as a solution and will price the offering based on the location's price sensitivity (poor countries = 1$ or less, USA = 3$ per month).


In countries with sufficient infrastructure, this is more of a premium option for when you go out of service, such as in the mountains. Also for underdeveloped places in first-world countries (I dunno such as Wyoming?

That being said, if you think you have a play that might pay off I say go for it.

I think the CPI will be the catalyst for a bad tech sell off along with a cascading meme crash, which god knows how that turns out. I’ve positioned myself accordingly (UVXY, SQQQ, and some puts on high PE tech and some meme stuff). 

It’s as much a spidey-sense thing as sophisticated analysis. I just can’t buy anything because it all seems like a house of cards right now, even though the economy itself is kicking ass. 

PS I am just referencing my “play money”, not my larger IRAs and Vanguard ETFs.

339,MP," In on MP. If you gonna buy into MP you gotta be willing to wait awhile. Right now they own the Mountain Pass mine which has 8% of the world's neodymium oxide reserves but they do not have the processing facilities. They currently process their ores in China and they only make  ~$3/kg in comparison to fully refined Neodymium oxide which can go upwards of $100/kg. However there are plans to finish Stage 2 processing by 2022 Q1 and Stage 3 eventually. Meanwhile it would be nice to load up on some but it won't make much in the short term until at least Stage 2 is complete but the real winner is when Stage 3 is done. Go take a look at their annual report for more information

Possible catalyst is DoD wanting to secure their supply of industrial magnets and accelerate stage 2 and 3 construction and/or banning the import of REO from China

Speaking of which it’s at a 10-year low P/E for those that still look at that for AMZN. There is nothing Amazon cannot expand into at this point if they desire, and their unabashed cultural thirst for continued innovation (unlike certain other trillion dollar companies) and dominance is unmatched.

I have always kept an eye on oil prices and sentiment around the company though and I got back in exxon around $52 and have averaged up a bit while also purchasing call options.

If all the oil in the world disappeared today, my guess is over 90% of the population would be dead inside of a month. These kids on Reddit think you're a paid shill for big oil if you point out truths like that.

410,BP," I agree completely about shell and BP. But what I will say is investor sentiment right now is better because of it, although I know that investing too much in green is going to hurt them long term. 

I think what happened with ExxonMobils board will help them in the short term with investor sentiment, but I also don't think having some new members on the board is going to derail their heavy O&G investments or strategy at all. One of my favorite things about Exxon is their strategy going forward and not investing heavily into green alternatives that they DO NOT have a competitive advantage in, that is where shell and BP are making mistakes. 

Carbon capture for Exxon is lucrative and I believe they will be able to make a business out of it. That is happening in Canada right now with Suncor, CNQ, among a couple others. They want carbon capture infrastructure.  To reduce emissions, and I believe that it is a necessary stepping stone to a greener future. I do NOT believe that solar and wind can ever replace the hydrocarbons we have beneath our feet, at least not yet. It's just unrealistic. 

Exxon and Cheese are my two favorites in this space as well. Chevron has a deal with toyota about providing hydrogen infrastructure and green hydrogen for their cells as well. Natural gas and carbon capture used together is a near net zero way to produce hydrogen and I think that will be the future of energy.

Realistically, he'll never exercise those options. As the stock price goes up, the premium will also go up. If FCX were to hit $16, it would be worth at least $1, since the intrinsic value of $15 plus $1 would equal the $16 stock price. There are other factors that influence price as well, such as time. Usually after a certain point, you'd just sell the options back to the market to pocket your gains or losses.

Your friend needs to first sell these tomorrow, since he doesn't know what he's doing. He can lose 100% of his equity if he doesn't understand them. And then second, he should move to a real broker.",JDinvestments,9,/r/stocks/comments/nvhn24/calls_help_for_a_friend/h139ca1/,0.028,0.868,0.105,0.9001

455,FRX, How can it be making money? The current price for a share of FRX is $10.69. It has a long way to go to get over $15. And what do you mean the .83 is the option contract price? That’s not very much money at all. So he paid .83 for this option contract?,uniballout,1,/r/stocks/comments/nvhn24/calls_help_for_a_friend/h13mqz6/,0.0,0.949,0.051,0.4098

457,FRX," All these basics are laid out in the link above. But here: first things first - call options are a wager that on a certain date a stock’s share will be higher than it currently is. In this case, the wager is that FRX, on October 15th, will be higher than $17.50 and $15, respectively. You want this to be true because the call option contract says you have agreed to buy 100 shares of FRX on that date, at those prices. If the shares are $20 on that date, you get them at a bargain price and can sell immediately for profit. If the price isn’t above $15 or $17.50 (the “strike price”) then no shares trade hands, but you are out the cost of the contracts. 

Cost of contracts: The average cost of your contracts are .42 on the 17.5 strike, and .60 cents on the 15 strike. This is a price per share and contracts are lots of 100. He bought 13 contracts at .42 per share. .42x100x13 = $546 and 5 contracts at .60 .60x100x5 = $300. So he paid $846 and will lose that money if the price stays low (and he keeps those contracts until 10/15 - which I’ll talk about next). 

So, you can see that his cost .42 and .60 have moved up to a current price (current value) of .65 and .83 cents. This is because the stock moved up today, and people thought “maybe the stock will move high by October”, so people were willing to pay more today for those contracts than he did yesterday. That’s how he’s made money already. 

These contracts are tradable just like stocks. As the stock price moves up and it looks like the contracts might make money, their value rises as well. Most people don’t hold these contracts through expiration. They wait for their value to move up and the sell them to the next person willing to make the same wager.

But let’s say he does hold and the price does go up. Let’s say it does hit $20 at the end of day 10/15. Using the 5 contracts at $15 strike means he buys (5x100) 500 shares at a total of $7500 when the real value of the shares is $10,000, making a $2500 profit on a $300 wager (.60 price per share call option contract).",12thandvineisnomore,1,/r/stocks/comments/nvhn24/calls_help_for_a_friend/h13u4po/,0.037,0.808,0.155,0.994

459,NOW, Because the calls have a .83 premium NOW but if the stock price were to go to $200 the premium would be around 187.00.
