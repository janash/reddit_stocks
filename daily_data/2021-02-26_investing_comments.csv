6,WPC, WPC. Divided of 5.83% which has been increasing over the years. Doing good with earnings. One of the best REIT’s out there as well.,soundbeast77,16,/r/investing/comments/lsqb55/best_dividend_value_stocks_to_buy_and_go_long/got5s12/,0.0,0.695,0.305,0.8481
7,KR, KR (Kroger brands) is undervalued and overly shorted in my opinion. It has been trading as low as 8 P/E and has 2.2% dividends.

8,RE," $NEE - Next Era Energy. Great utility, strong 4 decades worth of growth, positioned well in renewables, huge moat, etc. Biggest risk is more of a factor perspective of coming out of the disinflationary environment we've been in.

$MPW - I've long been a fan of this REIT, been a stable grower for me since 2018, and the dividend is still rather strong. Has good demographic headwinds globally, is fairly well insulated from a lot of risks, and has room to keep growing.

$COST - Not cheap on a valuation basis, but is there a better managed retailer? If it's between Costco or other defensive retailers like Walmart, i'll take Costco any day of the week. Not to mention they have room for future growth in their ecommerce department as well. I would wait to buy however since they're going to be facing very tough comps for the next quarter, keep an eye out for a decent low around April - May.

$CNQ - Canadian oil company, and a good play on a more inflationary environment. Strong dividend, good balance sheet, and one of the lowest costs of production around.

$EQC - Sam Zell's REIT. Probably a bit riskier since this is in the commercial RE space, but they are very defensive already and set up to weather any storms that are still likely to come in commercial RE. Zell is really good at navigating market risk - he completely avoided all risk in the GFC, and he had been de-risking prior to covid. Book value + dividend are very cheap here, and they're set up to expand by purchasing cheap assets when the time is right. Could be volatile if we see more selloffs, but the dividend like won't go away, and once again, could be a really good long-term buy.

$PGR - Progressive Insurance. Insurance on the whole is a very good value sector right now in my opinion. Just take a peek at almost any valuation metric and you'll probably be left scratching your head at why it's so cheap. You don't find large-cap stocks that are growing, decent sized moats, and generally lower risk that have p/e ratios below 12 these days.

$ANTM - See progressive, but this is on the health side. Health insurance has been a SUPER lucrative long term compounding industry over the last 30 years. Perhaps at the cost to patients, but as a shareholder, this is a great place to be so long as the threat to kill health insurance via medicare to all is off the table. And with Biden's election, that risk got removed.",cbus20122,8,/r/investing/comments/lsqb55/best_dividend_value_stocks_to_buy_and_go_long/gotmkqd/,0.086,0.724,0.19,0.9926
9,IMO," PFE.

Sliding towards 5 yr lows, >4% div yield with EPS to support it. Industry giant and a victim of buying the rumor and selling the news right now. IMO $40-45 is a fair valuation against its competitors. People need/want medicine and Pfizer has long been an innovator in that area (and not just mRNA vaccines). IIRC they had $9B for R&D on the balance sheet...they spend mid cap revenues on research & innovation AND pay a nice return on their vast book of formulations in manufacturing.

65,ABBV," That's not a ""money machine"", exactly--you're attempting to pick low-yield stocks with growth potential. If your picks are successful, stock price appreciation will *depress* yield further, not enhance it.

Here are some picks--they are not zero-risk, but that's what rebalancing is for. I've attempted to pick at least two per area with the idea of rebalancing within a sector or theme; you could take this idea and run with it. 

Since we're looking at a significant downturn and/or sector shift, I'd pay extra attention to how you enter these positions to get started--either hold back significant cash to lower your average share price with further dips, sell puts to collect premium as you enter each position, etc.

It is Brookfields renewable asset management stock. If you know anything about Brookfields other stocks you know its a winner. They maintain their dividends through pandemics which is a new thing I demand from a dividend stock (looking at you REITs). Also its in one of the most important industries that exist(renewable energy).

I bought an unreasonble amount when it first launched in July I think, at $48. Sold off  half my position when it reached $74 in January, to take profit and balance my portfolio. Then they issued more shares, which if I remember was to purchase back shares in one of their other Brookfield stocks they felt was undervalued(smart). The new shares drove the price down, and then this market dive the last week drove it down further. And their Ex-Dividend date just passed Thursday which contributed to more drop. This is all great because now I bought back another unreasonable chunk at $58. I expect this stock to reach $100 by 2022, which I will sell off half my position to balance again, while collecting the dividend all year.

Tl;dr - 8.23% dividend, stock is VERY cheap, new leadership is actively paying down debt, third largest fiber network in the world

Long version:

They’re paying out a massive 8.23% dividend right now and have potential for fast growth over the next few years. They acquired L3 back in 2018 which has now given them the 3rd largest fiber networks in the world (behind only Verizon and AT&T) and are set up big to provide commercial high speed internet/5G infrastructure. 

This came after a change in leadership and a fast rebrand from Centruylink into Lumen. New leadership has put a focus on moving off of older business lines, paying down debt (more below on this), and going for a pure telecom play. 

Drawback is they are loaded up with a lot of debt from the L3 deal and some of their older service lines (think centurylink telephones plans). This is hitting their bottom line hard over the short term. But the debt is manageable and they’ve committed to paying it down quickly + there’s good reason to believe they can wind down or even sell off these older business channels that are producing slim margins and weighing down the stock.

Because they have no debt on the balance sheet, and because they have construction expertise themselves, they can take over, complete  and sell any projects that default.  But they generally don't have issues as they make sure that the borrower has a decent amount of equity in the project.

I own Barrick, Newmont, and Kirkland Lake. Really just bought them as a hedge since couldn’t wrap my mind around buying a block of metal in a safe. Barrick historically has underperformed spectacularly but is their new CEO is one of the best in the industry so really I am banking on that.

360,GME," With the earnings per share just announced just over $4 for 2020 it makes it a bargain with a trailing P/E of 5!! With the stock at $20 and the $1.1 dividend to be paid  many of the shorts would probably get out bcs it requires them not only to pay the dividend but now the stock has room for growth with full year info. During the earnings call today they shared  very aggressive growth numbers for the next quarter. They are very bullish. I love it. So 10 PE puts the price at 40 and if you consider this to be a measly mortgage co (which is NOT) the average P/E is 15 which put the stock price at 60. So somewhere between 40-60 is the price of the stock.

361,RKT," With the earnings per share just announced just over $4 for 2020 it makes it a bargain with a trailing P/E of 5!! With the stock at $20 and the $1.1 dividend to be paid  many of the shorts would probably get out bcs it requires them not only to pay the dividend but now the stock has room for growth with full year info. During the earnings call today they shared  very aggressive growth numbers for the next quarter. They are very bullish. I love it. So 10 PE puts the price at 40 and if you consider this to be a measly mortgage co (which is NOT) the average P/E is 15 which put the stock price at 60. So somewhere between 40-60 is the price of the stock.

404,IMO," >Will it get worse? 

Maybe. I don't really have an answer. 

If interest rates rise back up to 3% (on the 10 year treasury), we could see the market fall another 15-20%. 

And I know it sucks to see your portfolio go down, but it also means that if we were expecting 6% growth at the current valuation, after we 'reset' we may expect closer to 8% going forward. So like I said in the previous comment, new money going in will grow faster than it would have before. 

But bottom line is you can't really predict interest rate movement. So it's better to just stay invested IMO.

Not always. When PE Ratios get to around 35 the return on that equity (when dividend adjusted) is right about 4%. So for instance MSFT today is PE 34 which equates to 2.9% return . At 1.5-2% bond yields MSFT is still the better deal even though there is downside risk but if bond or better yet treasury yields hit 4% then why wouldnt you go into treasuries and earn the 4% risk free. The only MSFT becomes desirable again is if its PE falls to where its risk adjusted premium is some amount higher than 4%. If it reverts to PE 17 then its a buy again since it will outperform bonds but the share price has to fall by 50%.

413,IMO," I do agree the inflation trade seems very crowded. Being crowded doesn't mean it won't happen tho. There are two hugely inflationary levers happening at the same time: 1) increased money supply 2) decreased production.

I do not think we have ever had two levers as seriously skewed as these two in history. It seems very unlikely it would not produce some inflation. For example, in the GFC we did not get inflation because we had *increasing* production. Namely from China. 

I do agree some of the trades miss the issue. For example, inflation does not mean businesses improve. If a business has a fall in volume like let's say oil it does not matter that the oil price is now $63. You are now selling 16% less oil. The higher price does not make up for this, so the biz got worse. This is especially prevalent in the mining metals trade. It is unlikely they will realize full production at current metal rates, IMO.

Anyhow, both are dropping after results which I believe it's just the market shaking out, but I wanted to see contrary opinions as I am only seeing people saying that they are bullyish in the long term.

428,AI," An argument against salary caps on stimulus

I realize this is dipping into a have vs have nots argument.  I want to be clear in stating that I belive UBI will be a necessity at some point with the advancements in AI in tech.  This is an argument instead that all taxpayers should be eligible for stimulus checks if stablizing the economy is truly the goal rather than politics.

Where I become frustrated is in the government capping eligibility on salary.  This limits stimulus effect dramatically, though I understand this limits cost.  

In modern America, it is nieve to believe that 100000 a year indicates financial solvency or financial health. With modern emphasis on debt accumulated wealth, the burden of student loan debt, medical debt, the incredible expense of real estate in different locations, this idea that people of many financial statta could not benefit from stimulus is flat out ignorant.

Lets take a specific example.  In San Francisco, a studio apartment can run up to 2000 a month.  Take out taxes for state and federal (limited decuctions now), high gas prices, insurance, car payment, and these folks not only are paying their share of taxes to our country but are living paycheck to paycheck.  In addition, they are basing qualification on 2019 income when you had nearly a full year of a normalized economy.

It is very easy to frame the issue of fiscal stimulus as helping the poor.  However, this simply isnt true in actuality.  There is a massive homeless situation in the US and the truly long term unemployed will not benefit from these measures anyway.  You have to have filed taxes.

The best approach for a broad based impact on both jobs and humanity is simply to cut all americans a check. This leads to discretionary expenditures which support businesses and potential job growth while protecting staples such as rent and utlities for others.

Now...the expense portion....so lets say this would cost 3 trillion rather than 1.4. We are dealing with numbers that are so huge that I find it hard to fathom a difference amongst supporters of government expenditure in modern America.  For those of us who wonder what our debt servicing looks like long term, that problem is not going away.  We are dealing with astronomical figures.

In sum, I am always baffled by the idiocy of our collective politicians in tailoring fiscal policy.  This approach reeks of another missed opportunity to keep tax payers at multiple of income levels engaged, many of whom will be furious at paying for other families while they struggle, improve multiple areas of the economy, and demonstrate competency regarding the difference between 100k in Los Angeles vs Kansas City.

445,GME," Bond yields play a critical role.  Remember expetcted interest rate hikes also impact corporate bond markets which are instrumental in growth capacities which Wall Street closely monitors.  It also impacts the lifeline of companies who have been depending on cheap credit. Further, it makes debt servicing more expensive. If I can make more money on bonds in the future with high interest rates, current bonds have to be traded at a discount.  

Just my 2 cents, but the only ""dumb fucking"" thing right now is the disconnect between the real economy and the stock market.  There are hundreds of thousands of looming evictions in both commercial and retail real estate...yet GME savants believe the company is actually worth $69420 a share.  Reverse mergers are a new fad because interest rates at low levels are forcing financial engineering to boost return rates.  These type of risky investments fall out of favor if I can generate higher returns on safer future investments.

Also, remember that markets are forward looking in aggregate.  

And...this is nowhere near the correction that is looming.

Dont get angry.  The good news is that this wont pop immediately.  You still can trade and make good returns.  Maybe just avoid stocks that are at all time highs with high debt loads.  Long term you will learn to appreciate corrections as these long dips are when people actually accumulate wealth when they protect their cash then buy at the lows for the correction period.",cbdscienceguy,1,/r/investing/comments/lsuk1s/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/goudxeg/,0.085,0.727,0.188,0.9844

I would say that on a month over month basis, the drop is within the tolerances of TDOC. Bear in mind that the stock was up 32% in January, so it’s still running a positive CAGR for this year.

Regarding pump and dump - it's illegal and it has a very specific meaning.

Regarding short interest - you may also want to google what that actually means and how it is reported. The current available short interest data is for settlement date 2/12 which was disseminated on 2/24. For GME - short shares on 2/12 is 16,468,038 shares. The float is 54,487,333 shares.

They receive a premium for the calls and sometimes lose out on value when the stocks rise above the strike price plus premium, and lose value when the stocks fall more than the premium.

Stocks, even if you write covered calls on them, tend to have high returns so they can pay out a large chunk without falling in NAV too much.

Due to the high volatility recently, covered call funds have underperformed the index, but still done decently.

I also laid out my case for Series I bonds [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/i3w6zj/suggestion_now_is_a_good_time_probably_the_best/) - if you can accept the caveats/limitations, they have enormous advantages over TIPS (including: no NAV fluctuation, deferred taxes, can't go negative, hold them anywhere from 1 to 30 years, etc).

For what it's worth, I myself split bonds down the middle - one half in nominal Treasuries and EE bonds and one half in TIPS and I bonds. In a crash, nominal tends to do better.

516,GME," **Portfolio advice!**

**Current situation**

\- 28 yrs old, with very secure job prospects. Earn 90k (AUD) yearly with increasing earning potential (5-10k / yr) . No debts.

&#x200B;

**Goals:**

\- Realise significant gains short-term (1-3 yrs) to take profit and use for other life goals as able (looking at putting deposit down on a property in the coming years)

\- Leave majority invested (50-75%) for longer term gains 10+ years

&#x200B;

**Horizon**

\- I have only invested \~70% of my entire equity in the stock market (so I have enough cash available to use for life related issues). This will hopefully mean I have the option of holding all investments as needed to realise positive gains (and not sell with a loss)

&#x200B;

**Risk tolerance:**

\- Moderate (not super conservative, but not jumping on GME either)

&#x200B;

**My thinking**

\- Bullish on the medium-long term future potential of clean energy, tech, space-related industries, genomics/health.

\- Realistic it may be a few years for \^\^\^ to really take off and realise sustained gains

\- Understanding of the need for diversification and investment in more ‘safe’ ETFs in interim

&#x200B;

**Current portfolio (70% of total equity)**

\- QQQ: 23%

\- PBW: 11%

\- ASIA: 9%

\- ARKK: 9%

\- QQQJ: 6%

\- Individual stock I like: 5%

\- UFO: 3.5%

\- ARKG: 3%

&#x200B;

**Current cash left over allocated for further investing over coming week/months (with ongoing steady inflow from savings from job)**

\- 7% of my total equity

&#x200B;

**Liquid cash saved for life and unexpected issues**

\- 23% of my total equity receiving interest in a bank

&#x200B;

**Current thinking/plans**

\- Leave some cash available to dollar cost average my investments as needed

\- Given a lot of my current investments are more on the volatile side, I was thinking about also investing in some less volatile, ‘safer’ ETFs (perhaps VT or VTI/VXUS) and growing this over time to a larger proportion of my portfolio.

529,USA," Hey folks. I was holding a few thousand in VTI in addition to my 403b with my employer. 

I pulled it out to throw into the wild game that's been happening over at WSB. I've cashed out a few of my positions, with pretty good gains. Now, this is *not* something I want to continue doing - that is, playing the market - because I don't know a ton about companies, how to research them, etc. I just knew enough about the most recent play over at WSB, that I hopped on pretty early.

Now, though, I want to move back to my M1 account. 

Here are some details, followed by my questions:
- 33 years old in USA, not earning much, and not much in 403b (literally a couple thousand), but I am contributing as much as possible to get the employer match, which is dismal and not guaranteed.
- Goal is to save enough to retire as soon as possible, even if that is the traditional age. At this point, I'm very worried about never retiring. Therefore, my approach is very aggressive.
- I'd love to buy a house someday, but at this point I feel it's either buy a house or retire.
- Risk tolerance is relatively high. I believe in buy-and-hold.
- No debt. Necessary Expenses are about 60% of our income, but real expenses are more like 80%. Obviously, we need to save more. We do have a good Emergency Fund, but will be funding it more.

Questions:
- Should I switch M1 from brokerage to Roth? I know with a brokerage, you can pull out anything, but with Roth you can pull out any contributions and if buying a house you can pull out up to $10,000 of gains as well.
- Browsing M1's expert pies, it looks like I might just want to go 100% Domestic Growth pie, and maybe add in something else that I feel might be growing, such as Cannabis and Electric.

One month, one stock may be a great candidate, another month, another stock will be a great candidate. It all depends on the current conditions in the options market + other intrinsic items to that stock itself.

IE, if you were to do this on TSLA over the last 1 month, it was a great call-buying time as the call-buying switched from TSLA to other stuff like game stop and such. IV dropped from around 100 all the way down to 50 as a lot of those out of the money calls have just decayed this entire time.

It's not so much about the volatility level as it's the rate of change of that volatility. Falling IV is great for selling calls. Rising IV not so much.

564,NPV," I believe Intel will be a good investment over the next 10 years, but your reasoning and 200 ""fair value"" price isn't realistic.

Intel is moving away from just chips and into a more data driven business, where they expect the majority of their revenue to come from in the future. Intel is expecting low single digit growth for the next few years, and will hopefull grow very quickly after. Using a few different best/worse case scenarios in a NPV calculator, I think Intel is pretty fairly valued at $60 given the risk of stiff competition. 

I'm long 25 shares at $52, but I wouldn't add more unless the price goes down to around $55. This is a company that you patiently watch and slowly build a position into.

566,AMD," I don't comment here often. I mainly lurk, but I'm thinking Intel has all the ducks lined up. 

Though their fabs are behind TSMC (and probably on par with Samsung, approximately) they WILL get their process sorted, and unlike 20+ years ago, they'll make headway in the gpu space. 

The new integrated igp is promising for their future stand alone gpus. 

The real danger is in amds increasing server share.

Nvidia isn't competition. They aren't bringing out radeon 5700 or geforce 
 3x00 killers. 

I imagine initial standalone xe performance will be at best 3060 performance, more likely 2060/1070. (At most) I'm honestly thinking more like 1060. 



There's a lot of wild cards. 

I imagine if they immediately went fabless and bought up a bunch of TSMC fab capacity,  and shrunk rocket lake they'd instantly be priced with AMD. 

Amds ability to get high yields isn't really revolutionary. Intel certainly can, and will likely do their own infinity fabric. 

Intel's problem is that they don't have enough capacity. But they will. 

I don't have a position in Intel, but I'm thinking about it.

Global foundries would be another interesting company. But they aren't publicly traded. I believe amd owns a portion of them.
