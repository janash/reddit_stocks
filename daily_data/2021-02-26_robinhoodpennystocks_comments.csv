25,DD," It being a bio-pharm company waiting on phase 3 results is what makes this a risky play. I know lots of DD / information etc etc. At the end of the day, you never know with these pharmacy trials because that’s the natural of pharmaceutical research. If you’re YOLO’ing into this trade, it’s no different than when you see guys on WSB YOLO on next day expiration SPY options. 

If you want to see what happens to a stock when it’s banking on 1 news break, and that news ends up bad- look at Workhorse from 2 days ago (ignore today because that was pure [luck](https://www.benzinga.com/node/19867917), no such move would happen with a bio-pharm company). 

Just understand there’s still a lot of risk in this if you’re taking a large % of your portfolio.

236,CTXR," Well I think the first thing is, you have to know what you're trying to do with the stock.

If you're goal was to make a quick buck and you jumped on the bandwagon late, then you need to expect red.  At that point it's a gamble and one should treat it as such.  It's not different than at a casino.  If you're ""needing"" or ""expecting"" to win... you probably shouldn't be gambling.

The easiest way to ignore the red is to only be playing with money you can afford to lose/be locked away, and to do your own DD.  If you believe in the stock and really know why you bought it in the first place, it really helps to weather the storm.

Let's take CTXR as an example.  I know that the product their developing, min-lock, is in it's third phase of trials and is looking promising.  If that get's FDA approval, the stock should do quite well.  I've read up on the company, and the people involved.  Listened to the latest news coming from the company and made a decision that I think they're moving in the right direction.

- Secondly, the market needed a correction, although this appears severe this is what happens to healthy markets.

- Thirdly, there is a stimulus bill on the horizon and therefore it is likely a jump will follow.

- Fourthly, the GME craze really creates unnecessary FOMO and many retail investors jump ship at the first opportunity to catch a ride for $. The market went down last time GME caught fire and this mirrors that action along with the other factors I mentioned above.

273,DD," >What I'm struggling to understand is: why are people pulling out of the market?


Theres a few reasons I think. 

One being that people are taking profits. Plain and simple.

Another being the psychological cycle the market goes through.  As more and more people believe that the bulls have run out of steam, the more and more it actually becomes true. 

Lastly, and this may be an unpopular opinion, but market manipulation. Yes, everyone seems to cry this at some point. But if you don't think that institutional investors are manipulating the market, you are destined to lose at this.

The worst thing you can do is sell for a loss that isn't caused by some sort of negative news on a specific company. If you make a bad pick and the company misses their earnings target or fails their clinical trials or something, absolutely jump ship. But just because the market goes down as a whole? Worst thing you can do is jump out at that point. If you trust your DD and you're confident in your stocks long term potential, then you need to stick to your guns. If you've identified a winning business, you can pretty much guarantee that investors with endless billions of dollars of resources to pay the smartest people in the world have found it, too. And its in their interest to keep you out and buy up as much as they can at as cheap a price as possible. The worst part is, they can easily spend 3-5 years keeping it artificially low so that you and others like you get scared away from investing in a particular stock. If you are confident in your research, you hold that stock forever. They can't buy shares that you won't sell.",platypusbelly,5,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/lt467y/inflation_and_the_status_of_the_market/gov8z6q/,0.168,0.701,0.13,-0.9329

276,NDRA," I appreciate the thoughtful response, but whole heartedly disagree that there is no place now or in the future for a device that can provide MRI level imaging at a fraction of the cost.  You actually provided a perfect example of one of it’s immediate uses in your post.  You were correct in saying that there are currently companies that are trying to develop medications for the treatment of NASH and Fatty Liver Disease.  If you were one of those companies, would you prefer to have to pay for an MRI to test the efficacy of your drug, or something that costs 1/50th of that test? 

Secondly, this technology is proprietary, and just starting out.   The natural progression long term for NDRA here would obviously be to develop this further to detect other things, like cancer.  Beyond that, I obviously don’t disagree on how big of an issue obesity is, and how easily preventable it is either, but everybody has know about it for a long time, and it’s not getting better.  The the idea that we wouldn’t screen for something that is incurable seems foolish.
