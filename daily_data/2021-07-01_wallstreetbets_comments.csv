Also, since Porsche owned close to 75% of *all* VW shares (both directly and via options), and there were 20% held by other companies and indices, the actual float of shares on the open market was max 5% or so, and some estimate it was even lower.

>According to a recently filed lawsuit, throughout the Class Period, the Company and its senior management concealed from investors that ContextLogic's fourth quarter 2020 monthly average users (""MAUs"") had declined materially and were not growing.

In other words, hype to the point of alleged illegality.

AMD has a lot of consumer and big data clients to serve. ""Chip shortages"" aren't really effecting that type of silicon, it's going to hurt EVs, Smart Phones and other devices which use small chips (such as Graphics cards, which does effect AMD... but not a lot).

CLOV starts the week in the 12's, getting more people to buy $13 Calls for Friday, then pumps to around 14ish midweek and gets more retail involved.

In reading this, it seems to me that the competitive advantage provided by PLTR’s software benefits early adopters the most, since it provides them with insights that may be invisible to competitors in their space. As their competitors sign on to the same software, that might minimize said advantage. That makes me wonder, will PLTR have multiple clients in one field? Or will a company sign a deal with PLTR on the condition that they get an exclusive partnership? In any case, it would be very interesting to get a list of companies that have signed significant deals with PLTR thus far. If one believes in the software enough to invest, then investing in some of these early adopting clients might also make sense.

They have purchased quite a few of them, but for now they are only being driven by their TOM (transportation operations management) associates. These were hostler drivers that amazon has paid to get their CDL so they can move their loads much cheaper than the 3rd party drivers do. While it's pretty amazing watching this plan unfold, and further planting the stake of their monopoly on everything, this is going to take some time. Right now TOM moves maybe 2% of amazon's volume with the rest being moved by 3rd parties. The game plan is obviously to eliminate any part of fulfilment that's not done by their own employees, from the Chinese factory to your doorstep. But this plan will take some time. I would say probably 3-5 years before a majority of their freight is moved by CNG. That being said, it will happen eventually.

887,PLTR," I am long pltr. However weeklies on this seems nuts. I don't even do options but IV must be insane in this. Theta on weeklies must also be insane. Again I don't do options but just my view (might be entirely incorrect).

I don't even know if current price is a ""good"" price. What I do think is long term PLTR is going to the fucking moon. I just don't know when. As such I am just long in it now and accept it may drop 50% before it gets to the moon. This might also be the cheapest price I can get moving forward which is why I have a small long position in it.

I disagree the 1 year chart is bullish. It doesn't really show much of anything other than volatility to me and resistance at current levels. Stock could really go either way.

The idea back then was that it crashed due to the hedge fund sell liquidation with no change to the fundamentals and would go back up once everyone bought the cheap shares.

It's been 4 months since then and it's traded sideways at roughly the same price it was before the massive run up preceding the crash.

952,ROKU," It has been going sideways which is a good thing imo, considering it was nuclear waste 3 months ago. Fundamentals from Q1 were strong, and should be better in Q2 with reopening - streaming is hot, movies, and sports. I believe they report beginning of August. Also, in this case, sideways would be considered the accumulation phase. If you look the last few days it broke out of the 43.5 range that it was stuck in. It's in the process of retesting 43.5 and the 200sma. Got close today, but not yet. If it bounces strong off of that it could take out 50 quick. If not back in accumulation.

You buy VIAC at $45 and wait six months you will make at least 50% because it's almost guranteed to be bought out in the $70-100 range like you said. No way they sell for less than $70 given how recently the stock was pushing $100. Shareholders would riot.

In March the reason why it spiked to 9.45 was because of the merger announcement, at least mainly because of that. I know a certain fintwit user is also in on it and that is their biggest long so I assume why the price stays above its previous 2.50 support level.

So WISH is claiming $2.5bn in revenues for the year, where revenues are actually about $250m.

1025,JPM," I worked sales in payments for four years. A large international payments company. Direct competitor to Paysafe in all respects except we were more restrained on gambling.

Paysafe make money, in large part, by charging merchants for a fee per card transaction. This is known as merchant acquiring. (Yes, the term ""acquiring"" is a little odd here, but keep following)

This fee is subject to many variables, including interchange fees charged to Paysafe by the card scheme (Visa/MC), as well as competition. Acquirers historically were subsidaries of banks - Chase Paymentech are examples of one that still is - JPM, in this case.

 As fees are usually taken before income is paid to the merchant (else invoiced payable within 30 days), it means bank-linked acquirers can significantly reduce their txn fee (and thus increase the topline) for merchants as an incentive they want to upsell more profitable products like loans to. I have worked in the industry and seen it time and again. One large international merchant even got free acquiring, they were that good a customer of the bank's other services. I even worked personally in combo with a bank on a deal of such a type.

Whilst I appreciate that gambling companies are higher risk and some acquirers won't touch them...the barrier to entry is just the acquiring price and the willingness of a competitor to pant-drop. And they do.

Plus I interviewed at Paysafe once. UK office, pre-Covid. There wasn't any buzz, any excitement. It seemes boring and uninspired. Granted, its a subsidary office.

I hold no position on this stock and I am not planning to. Nor am I looking to shit all over the stock per se. Just cautious advice from personal experience.",Modja,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oblzj8/my_highconviction_bet_on_paysafe_psfe/h3p2bfp/,0.06,0.802,0.138,0.9754

The Call and Put have a delta of .56. If it were to go down $1, your call would be at \~126$ while your put would be at \~38. So you're still down \~30$ from the original investment. If the stock moves drastically and it goes up or down 2$ and the Call or put becomes very volatile increasing its delta you would lose less money and make more of a profit from the Put just because of the higher cost value to you. So, you would have to try to get something very close to each other to make the most profit. IE: cost of call would be .75 and Put would be like .79 or something. I will test see how it goes.

My CEO has been a part of one of those MLM type ""plug and play"" marketing schemes. It's pretty much a cult ""you didn't get results? you're not doing magic system hard enough! Look at these outliers that performed well! (definitely not just firms that got lucky)"" I've finally convinced him to focus on online advertising instead of the useless direct mail marketing we've been doing for 8 years.

Over the long run the Russell 2000 (Small Cap US Stocks), has actually performed the best. So what are you comparing manager returns too? If you take it even further, pretty much every asset class outside of US stock, fund managers beat the benchmarks on a regular basis with asset classes like International, EM, REITs, Bonds of all types, etc. So if your goal is to only be invested in large US stocks then that is fine, but number one - it’s not the best historically performing asset class, and number two - it’s not the only thing you should invest in, since past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Hello Jose, 

Thank you for contacting TD Ameritrade with your inquiry. My name is Faith Smith and I am happy to assist you today.

Thank you for reaching out to us about your trade commissions. While we do not have a flat fee for unlimited trading, monthly or otherwise, you can request to have a lower commission rate. This is certainly something I can investigate for you, but please understand that TD Ameritrade does stand by the value of our pricing since we do offer a lot more products and services that other discount brokerage firms do not, for example 24-hour customer service, 2 trading platforms at no charge, and Senior Financial Consultants for clients at a certain dollar value in their accounts, also at no charge to the client. 

Can you please respond with the following?
1. What rate would you be happy with?
2. Do you have any external assets you could transfer/consolidate with TD Ameritrade to get a lower rate and, if so, how much?
3. How active will you be trading in this account (trades per month) and what assets will you be trading?
4. What investments you are primarily interested in trading not only now but in the future?
5. Which brokerages are offering a lower rate, and what rate?
6. How many option trades per month, on average? External and internal option trading. 
7. How many option contracts per month, on average? External and internal option trading.

Please respond with this information, so we can better evaluate the situation. The more information I can collect, the bigger the case I can build for upper management to consider honoring your request. 

If you have any other questions please let us know. We're always happy to help.

Thank you for your business.
