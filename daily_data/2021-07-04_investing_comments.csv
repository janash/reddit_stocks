0,BABA," So this is the second time now that china has screwed over its biggest startups near or post ipo. What kind of signal are they trying to send to investors? Dont invest in china??? 

 Anyway i was pretty bullish on BABA and tencent but i think ill scale them back now till the regulatory environment changes.

1,FB," This has to be an unpopular opinion...and for the record, I distrust the CCP as much as the next person, but these crackdowns may not be entirely bad. Let's look at some examples:

\- So in this case, Didi's operation got suspended because ""Didi had illegally collected users' personal data.""

\- Alibaba got fined because of monopolistic practices.

\- Ant Group's IPO got slashed because the CCP wanted to regulate Ant Group like an actual bank.

To be honest, these sound pretty reasonable to me. Facebook was in trouble for collecting data without content too. Remember the whole Cambridge Analytica scandal? But now everyone is hot for FB stocks.

Microsoft has been fined millions by the EU for monopolistic practices as well. But everyone loves Microsoft stocks nonetheless. 

And as to Ant Group, they are a massive financial service company that can offer customers credit. How come they don't get to be regulated like a bank? My point is that these actions make sense and good regulations is beneficial for investors too in the long run.",FlameoHotman-_-,44,/r/investing/comments/odk4og/didi_app_suspended_in_china_over_data_protection/h415r1e/,0.074,0.744,0.181,0.9769
2,BABA," Yeah I sold my China big tech holdings after the Jack Ma / BABA / Ant Capital escapade. I’m fine holding small fast growing companies, but it’s clear that once they get to a certain size the Communist Party will knee cap them whenever they feel like. Not worth the risk, unless you’re expecting extreme growth in the near term with state support (for me that’s the China EVs).",r3dd1t0rxzxzx,-2,/r/investing/comments/odk4og/didi_app_suspended_in_china_over_data_protection/h41y3i6/,0.024,0.656,0.32,0.9697

I mean you can't even if you wanted to. Anyone buying shares in NIO, BABA, etc. are buying shares of a shell company located in the Cayman Islands. You don't actually hold stock in Chinese companies, it's impossible.

It is not about whether China should regulate however they want and their intention. Issue is as investor, you can have substantial loses overnight cause there is no real “check and balances”.

17,MSM," I generally agree with several posters: basic fundamentals, broad indexes and the like. FUD is strong in both directions and sometimes it’s hard to find the truth. 

Ever heard of hedging? Keep a large portion of your portfolio fundamentally sound and then bet against yourself. I still use some basic strategies like sticking with simple broad indexes. Here’s how I work, this is not financial advice, just me explaining my strategy. 

After the MSM starts talking about “all time highs” and  “record breaking run ups” for about a year I start dollar cost averaging into inverse index funds. Funds that do the opposite of the index they track. DOG for the DJIA, PSQ for NASDQ, SH for S&P, etc. buy a little every week and when a correction comes sell. Take the profit and invest in your regular portfolio. This works because the lowest point in the cycle is the best time to sell the inverse funds and buy the dip. 

For example, March 2020 the value of everyone’s portfolio went down 20%. But I gained 20% on the inverse funds, which made up 10% of my total portfolio at the time. A lot of math later and I basically increased my share total in my traditionally positioned portfolio by .1%, at a discounted share price in only one month. I’m 50 and have had a 401K since I was 22. That’s A LOT of shares. 

I haven’t owned any of the inverse funds since April 2020 and actually just started buying the inverse indexes again. S&P is up around 100% since the March 2020 crash and lots of fundamentals look… unusual. I agree renewable energy will take over, but birth is difficult and painful. We will see plenty of dips and corrections along the way.",Adam_Smith_1974,2,/r/investing/comments/odce0k/preparing_your_portfolio_for_stagflationdebt/h413pjj/,0.05,0.83,0.119,0.9467
18,AMC," You need cash to secure the put, like other poster said. However, if you think of it as buying the underlying shares directly, then it makes a lot of sense, you got the calls basically for free, so you can participate in the upside of the underlying.

I think the hard part is about when to close the LEAP call when you are in profit, you need to really think about what goal you have if you were to hold the underlying shares, eg. holding for 1 year, 2 years, 3+ years, or 100% profit of your calls, etc.

I can only do this with LEAPs on stocks with solid fundamentals or growth stories. I can’t believe one can do this with speculative stocks like AMC, this is where my thoughts differ from yours, you need to be prepared to set your cash on fire basically - calls will be worthless with IV crash or share price crash and you get to baghold a pile of a dying company’s shares from your short put.

24,LEAP," Here is the scenario on Tsla trading around 680.  For every put you sell you need $68k in cash or margin. Let's say the call is the same cost as the premium on the put.  If Tsla decreases in price to $500 you are losing $18k per contract. Also if Tsla remains volatile and trades sideways you will have a hard time buying back you put as IV increases and people pay more for puts anticipating a drop.

I could see Tsla dropping to $400 just as easily as it trading between $500 and $650 for the rest of the year.

44,ASTS," I rarely do this kind of thing, but recently I sold all of my diversified holdings and went all in on a single space company, $ASTS.

ASTS could be a game changer, or at least turn into one hell of a speculative bubble. They're building a constellation of satellites called Spacemobile that will provide space-to-device 5G and LTE to *every existing device*, on *every inch* of planet Earth. Even to phones on planes, trains, ships, and autos. Already, they have binding agreements with some of the industry's biggest players: AT&T, Vodafone, Telefonica, Telstra, Samsung, and Rakuten. These guys will be doing 50/50 profit splits with existing carriers, so customer acquisition and scaling should be nearly instantaneous as clusters of satellites start online in 2023.

As a bonus, this stock got massively oversold during the SPAC Panic. It's very much on the upswing now, and appears to be in the early stages of going viral as a memestock (for better or worse).

45,PT," I rarely do this kind of thing, but recently I sold all of my diversified holdings and went all in on a single space company, $ASTS.

ASTS could be a game changer, or at least turn into one hell of a speculative bubble. They're building a constellation of satellites called Spacemobile that will provide space-to-device 5G and LTE to *every existing device*, on *every inch* of planet Earth. Even to phones on planes, trains, ships, and autos. Already, they have binding agreements with some of the industry's biggest players: AT&T, Vodafone, Telefonica, Telstra, Samsung, and Rakuten. These guys will be doing 50/50 profit splits with existing carriers, so customer acquisition and scaling should be nearly instantaneous as clusters of satellites start online in 2023.

Lanifibranor, our lead product candidate, is an anti-fibrotic treatment acting on the three PPARs (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors), which plays a key role in controlling the metabolic, inflammatory and fibrotic processes. We are investigating lanifibranor for the treatment of NASH, a severe and increasingly prevalent liver disease that is already affecting over 30 million people in the United States.  
We are developing a second clinical program with odiparcil for the treatment of patients with mucopolysaccaridosis type VI (MPS), a rare and severe genetic disease. Odiparcil also has the potential to address other MPS types, characterized by the accumulation of chondroitin or dermatan sulfate (MPS I or Hurler/Sheie syndrome, MPS II or Hunter syndrome, MPS IVa or Morquio syndrome and MPS VII or Sly syndrome).

My current plan is to invest 50% in US / UK index funds. 40% in medium risk managed funds or other medium risk areas and 10% in a small section of larger crypto currencies.
