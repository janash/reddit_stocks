3,AMC, Except on AMC and possibly ATOS if you just hold and do the DD instead of making a quick buck (and look at not only why but when it will take off) you'll pull in some mad profits.,jennburr,1,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/nqls7g/atos_cracks_4/h0ca06z/,0.1,0.811,0.089,-0.1154

8,DD, This is pretty popular where I'm from. My friend sends me DD all the time I don't read but he's had it since .89 and claims it will easily 5x from here. I've taken gains twice but now is a good time to get in imo.

9,AM," Grats on that win. I screwed this one up today. I bought some OEG right away at 7:30 AM this morning and held it for about 2 hours. Nothing was really happening, so I got worried it was a pump and dump and I missed the pump. So I quickly sold to avoid getting stuck holding the bag.
