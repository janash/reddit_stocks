21,MO," >An interesting thing has taken place for the Aug 20 Options contracts. Basically there is a nice little ladder built up all the way to the $7 a share. 800,000 shares at $4, 800,000 shares at $5, 360,000 shares at $6 and 560,000 shares at $7. I find it interesting that the $7 calls are more popular than the $6 calls. To sum up, if this snowball starts rolling and options contracts start to get exercised it could help the big MO.

You do realize that if the short calls are covered, it will have 0 effect on the share price, right?",1One2Twenty2Two,2,/r/pennystocks/comments/oztw8w/sesn_pt_2_when_i_gaze_into_the_future_and_make/h824hbp/,0.0,0.762,0.238,0.9726

27,RSI," Haha its nothing crazy I just watch the most hyped stocks on twitter,reddit, chat rooms etc... 

Then I try to wait for it to dip, and once it begins to consolidate, I jump in with a stop loss right at that consolidation or bounce, if it brakes my support I am out, usually can get a nice 8-20% on the bounce just make sure to watch volume is there, cos you might see a boucne and think its good entry but the bounce is on low volume.

I try get in when the big green candle engulfs previous red candle is a pretty good strategy try it out!

$NSAV $KYNC $RSHN even $CYBL look at 30M chart for past 2 weeks and see how you coulda got better entry.

Indicators I use are 5 and 13 ema cross, Heiken Achi and RSI, but tbh they aren't needed too much price action number 1!",mateyman,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/ozhv58/any_tips_for_someone_who_wants_to_day_trade/h80i02d/,0.037,0.806,0.157,0.9517
