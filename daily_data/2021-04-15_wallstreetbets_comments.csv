9,GME," # Guys I can't believe some of you still dont understand.This will moon when AND ONLY WHEN there is a forced buyback 🤦🏻‍♂️

**How to achieve forced buyback?**  
1. Share recall  
2. Margin call  
3. Small raw buying pressure to push unhedged new options ITM so that hedging provides 'free' upward movement on TACTICAL MOMENTS ONLY.
4. Forced liquidation by DTCC  
5. Hard intervention by the SEC  


Unless one of these happens, the price can go anywhere.... and it doesn't matter if it's $200 or $40 a share...  

**Red days dont mean the squeeze is off, green days dont mean the squeeze is on. The price is fucking irrelevant (unless you're buying, then big red days are something to celebrate)**

You should stop caring. We've been saying this for months, but everytime we have a green day you guys want to celebrate and cheer because ""where lambo"" like a bunch of spoiled children.  And on red days you freak out way too much.


**Get fucking patient**  
For those 5 catalysts that I listed there are many things 'in the works'.  
The DTCC is spewing new regulations like a toddler that ate too much icecream.  
There is a shareholder vote 9th of June, GME hasn't released what we'll be voting on however.  
SEC just got a new head that is known to be anti hedgefund bullshit.  


**What is important?**  
\- Buy if you can. This determines how much exposure you have once we moon. More shares is more tendies.  
\- HOLD. Seriously. Don't daytrade, don't sell. Just hold. Doesn't matter if we're down 50% or up 40%. Stop giving a shit. This will only moon if there are not enough shares to go around. By holding, you are taking your shares and you're saying ""These are mine now. Less to go around"".   
\- Stop fucking promising yourselves dates. Especially if you're smoothbrained. Don't get excited at all. Stop it. You're setting yourself up for constant dissapointment which will paperhand you and ruin this for yourself. Yesterday I told you not to overcelebrate and I was told to fuck off and not ruin the fun. See where the fun yesterday got you? Totally (and without good reason) totally dissapointed today.

Reuters 3:31 PM ET 4/15/2021 - Nate Raymond

>BOSTON, April 15 (Reuters) - Massachusetts regulators on  Thursday sought the revocation of Robinhood's broker-dealer license after  charging that it encourages inexperienced investors to place risky trades  without limits, while the online brokerage sued to invalidate a new rule  underlying the case.

158,VIAC," Is that in writing?  Can he just make another pledge that he changed his mind and 100 million shares were sold on such and such a date, etc.  It's an interview, not some formal  prospectus  or something filed to the SEC.   That's a pledge by a CEO that gave himself a 100 percent raise during a pandemic and near bankruptcy of the company.

With Wanda selling their controlling voting shares, no one is minding the store.   He wouldn't have made this type of request if they were in control of the voting shares.  'Hey can you let the company have half your value in equity by giving us this blank check'.  Because if he did that the next thing they'd be voting on is a new CEO.

But that's the right thing to say by the CEO about this outrageous IMHO proposal, and I'm sure he probably means it at the time of saying it.  But his he really going to have access to 500 million shares, with the stock price high, with a chance at 4 billion in the coffers, or risk it going back down to a dollar in 2022.

Frankly if they do get 500 million shares, it probably would be better for their share holders if they sell it as quickly as possible.  Not having it be a Damocles' sword over the share price.  We've seen what it can do with these  Archegos fiasco stock dumps, shares of VIAC can go up a buck, and then mass selling happens has these banks take advantage of the stock price to unload more of these shares they repossessed.",ZZ556,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mr6gz5/amc_ceo_pledges_and_will_file_that_they_will_not/gukowug/,0.058,0.816,0.126,0.93

160,AMC," From 12/31/2019 they had about 100M shares outstanding and now they have 400M outstanding (might be more). So a 4X increase in shares.

This stock traded at a little over $7 per share at 12/31/2019. Basically, as long as the fundamentals in the company are not improved, how we get to a current share price of $9.5 is beyond me. Just based on stock dilution alone we should be under $2 a share. $9.5 a share now is equivalent to $38 a share prior to dilution. In 2016 the share price hit around $35 before declining.

AMC during 2020 increased their debts (not sure if they paid it back with the shares sales in 2021) as well. Per the cash flow they generated $740M from debt financing in 2020.

Now I am not suggesting that bankruptcy is necessarily a current concern as there is a decent chance that some high demand to watch movies in theaters will help them short-term, but unless something improves on a massive scale about their business I don't understand the optimism about their share price.

In any case, no kidding he is promising not to sell those shares. As it is, this stock is insanely overvalued. Wanda America saw this and dropped the stock.

208,AMC," They already diluted the shares a massive amount this year. Just no new share dilution. They raised enough money to cover paying their bills for the rest of the year already. The question is what happens next year. In any case the share price is detached from reality so is bound to go down a significant amount sooner or later, barring some miraculous turnaround that would boost the company higher in value then it has ever been.

To put this in perspective, AMC is trading compared to the years pre-COVID at above its all-time highs, when you factor in share dilution. So to justify the current share price the company would not only need to meet its former high-marks (from back in 2016) it would have to exceed that.

In other words, AMC is a terrible investment.",aka0007,82,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mr6gz5/amc_ceo_pledges_and_will_file_that_they_will_not/gul1ksi/,0.046,0.833,0.121,0.8442

214,AMC," He needs to give us more. There are worlds I could see 100% increase in outstanding being justified.

For example, if the company changed its executive compensation model to something like holding half the outstanding and paying dividends. The executives wouldn't own those shares, the company would. But executives would be compensated via dividends earned from those shares.

Or if AMC had a real long-term plan to enhance its value. Movie theaters are always going to exist. Home streaming is about as much of an existential threat as HBO was. People go to the movies for the experience of the big screen. But to justify such a new issuing, there needs to be some type of transformation.

Or if AMC had SUCH bad debt, if they don't raise the money they'll go bankrupt. Well, 100% dilution is better than bankruptcy for the shareholders. This might be the case, as AMC does have roughly 5 billion in debt. But throwing all the debt at the shareholders at once is a bit unnecessary. 

Either way, shareholders should get value from the existence of those new shares.

226,GME," I have spent more time looking at GME and my takeaway is that while I think it is valued too high (I would not consider buying shares unless it went under $40) they are in a very different situation. 

For one, they did not need to raise funds to remain operational, in fact they recently announced they are paying back some debt. If they are raising funds (via any share sales... I am not sure the status of that though) it would be part of their plan to turn around the business.

They also recently had the whole top level of the business turned over and you have people with the experience now and drive to change this business in place. If they are successful, I think it is not hard to come up with valuations that justify the current price (but this is a big if).

I do remain skeptical that they will be able to change around the business and drive enough future profitability/cash flow to justify the current price (i.e. I think a value of essentially $10B+ on a nonexistent online business is a bit much, even with the brand recognition and great team in place) so remain bearish on them but would not advise anyone to bet against them (based on both the future prospects and the nature of the retail investors in it).

Interesting, could be the whole short-squeeze thing and the interest it is driving is a text book case in reflexivity. Shareholder support in this case allows or causes the business to turn around which in turn can make the business into a fundamentally valuable enterprise.",aka0007,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mr6gz5/amc_ceo_pledges_and_will_file_that_they_will_not/gule1ot/,0.022,0.868,0.11,0.9735

As to being short, I bought a little while back a few puts. Nothing significant (I really don't feel like taking the time to dig extensively into the company as the money I have involved here is not sufficient to justify spending much effort). I would not recommend anyone to short or buy puts as I think there is way too much a chance that retail investors keep on buying AMC and propping the price up for a while to come.

As to why they issued shares, I am not questioning that. They issued shares as they were facing bankruptcy due to being unable to get financing. Then retail jumped on AMC and drove the price up, making raising funds via share sales much easier. There is no mystery here. The end result is you still have the dilution.

>Won't you allow it..? Wall street is getting more and more into crypto (institutional adoption).

No, we won't allow it. Just a couple of reasons offhand:

1. It's a slippery slope as for what to include and what to exclude.

2. You don't need to explicitly talk about crypto to discuss stocks that deal with crypto. There was [a good example of a $COIN DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mr1za6/coin_150b_570share_price_target) that barely mentioned crypto at all. 

3. It's *really hard* to have a substantive discussion on crypto because the main talking points have been hashed to death.

4. If you thought GME was cultlike, crypto is infinitely moreso. I never thought a non-crypto community could so unabashedly try to pump and dump something, but I was proven wrong. I don't think anyone wants to go through that again. 

5. Lack of regulation. Unlike stock markets which require all sorts of transparency measures like ownership disclosures, crypto has none of that. Not to say these measures don't fail (Wirecard) but they're significantly better than nothing.

6. It makes our community WAY MORE attractive for bad actors. We barely let anyone's side project in, but imagine if one got past us that also stole people's wallets? It would be a disaster. 

7. Crypto subs have to deal with an absolutely insane amount of highly capable scammers. I don't know if we could keep up.

8. The use of leverage means that anyone could very easily ""fake"" a YOLO post. 

> I thought that was WSB. Not just some community that purposefully handicaps earnings and stifles information.

I'm not sure where this sentiment is coming from. There are plenty of other subs that allow crypto, and it's cool if that's your thing, but WSB isn't the place for it. 

It's arguably better that people go to r/CryptoCurrency or whichever sub best suits them, rather than dividing things even further and diluting the discussion. Not every sub has to include crypto. 

That said, we should really get back to posting the weekly earnings threads.

---

And look, I know this isn't what some of you were hoping for, but we basically have a choice to make, to keep striving to be the best at what we are, or to dilute ourselves and open up to ""normies"".

The last thing we want is to become a hivemind, because *that* is how good discussion dies. We were successful at keeping politics at bay, and it's been a huge part of the reason why WSB is doing well. We need to do the same for crypto because I've seen the discussion that tends to stem out of those communities, and it's almost identical. 

Finally, this is just my personal opinion, not that of the broader mod team, however, this is wide consensus that crypto is not something that will ever have a place on this sub.

You've spent more than 100 shares cost for the permission to buy shares at a higher price than now, less than a year from now.

I think it's smarter to buy 100 shares and sell covered calls against it. I'm not expecting rockets, just swings, so high short term IV.

I guess with what you have, what could do is sell $200 calls against your position and if/when GME gets that high just roll them up and out a week to like 220, then 240, etc until the time cost isn't worth it or they expire worthless.

606,ATH," **Daily Stock Market Forecast**

Things are looking bright and sunny today.

* Companies are smashing earnings expectations across the board
* Unemployment is dropping faster than expected. [Initial jobless claims](https://www.dol.gov/ui/data.pdf) were were 576,000, the lowest in more than a year, and well below the forecast of 710,000.
* [Retail sales](https://www.census.gov/retail/marts/www/marts_current.pdf) are booming, up 9.8% compared to a forecast 6.1%.

I'm forecasting a **green day** with a NASDAQ **high of 14,102** and a **low of 13,996**. 

That would put us just a little shy of ATH at today's peak.

*[I try to predict the NASDAQ every day.

NIO signs deal with Sinopec: aims to have 5000 battery-swap stations by 2025!

""NIO signed a strategic cooperation agreement with fossil fuel energy giant Sinopec on Thursday, marking another milestone for the electric vehicle company.

Sinopec Chairman Zhang Yuzhuo said the company will have 5,000 charging stations and battery swap stations by 2025.

NIO CEO William Li said NIO's first second-generation battery swap station and the company's 201st battery swap stations went online Thursday at a Sinopec gas station in Beijing.""\~cnevpost

The Chinese EV market has around 85 different EV brands and is super competitive. So at this point there seems to be little reason to get excited that just one of these brands has reached agreement to secure swap facilities with just one line of filling stations, however huge Sinopec is.

Ericsson has higher revenues and lower operating expenses resulting in better margins.

My understanding is that when RKT sells a loan and they keep the MRS they record in net income the future cash flows from the fees collected by the lifetime of the loan. So in the next period when they collect the cash they need to discount that from the net income since they already had accounted for it in previous periods. So change in MSR are as you said the market value of the service portfolio and it can be affected by pre payments, delinquency and foreberance.",anfego,5,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mrhzgr/rocket_companies_rkt_due_diligence/gumtaqb/,0.015,0.884,0.101,0.8748
1075,RKT," I know about MSR. the servicing fee does not change with changes in rates. It's generally 25bp for most products and has been for years. MSRs are similar to IOs.  If rates go down and the customer prepays, the value decreases. If rates increase, therefore decreasing the refinance incentive and extending the period over which you receive revenue, the value of the servicing asset increases. There are two elements to consider: revenue and cost. Servicing revenues are the 25 bp on collateral UPB. 

 The costs can kill you of you don't get them right. I don't know if RKT services their own loans or sells the servicing, I didn't read everything you posted, but there are costs associated with servicing loans. There's the base cost on performing loans, keeping track of escrow, tax and insurance and producing reports as well as interacting with customers with their questions about payoff etc. If the loan goes into delinquency, the costs increase and if it goes into foreclosure, the costs are even higher. These are fixed costs as you have to hire people. 

An efficient servicing operation with a good handle on their costs is essential.
If the underlying mortgage completely prepays (or defaults), the servicing revenue disappears but guess what, the fixed costs remain. It can be profitable, but they are volatile.",subsetsum,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mrhzgr/rocket_companies_rkt_due_diligence/gunqb4g/,0.033,0.859,0.108,0.9418

1085,RKT," The refi market has already started to decrease 10%, the cashflow spike that they had in 2020 will not be maintained over the long term.  1)  there is a finite number of eligible refis in the first place and those continue to decrease when rates increase  2) there is a supply constraint in housing that is also limiting new purchases.

Prior to their boost in sales due to the refi-boom, their EPS for earnings attributed to the RKT common share holders was around $0.30.  Their stock price is trading around 75PE right now based on their normal income rates.  TLDR, they are not 4\~5x undervalued.

Many people are forgetting that the common shareholders only account for a 6% stake in ownership.  That 6% is represented as ""earnings attributed to RKT"" in their 10-k/10-q documents and are a large difference from their $9.4B profit (vs $9.4B \* 0.06 = $564M).

1088,USA, The only thing is your not also factoring in growth in the other business segments. I feel that’s what everyone is over looking because of how small that revenue is at the moment.

1089,RKT," The lack of information being provided about those other segments (like auto sales) doesn't help.

From the 10-K (spread across different pages):

* Page 9:  Facilitated in $750M in auto purchases (value of vehicle, not revenue)
* Page 61:  2020 Auto Revenue $23,663,000
* Page 61:  2020 Auto Sales:  \~32,100

That comes out to be about \~$737 in *revenue* per car attributed to overall RKT holdings and about $44 attributed to common shareholders.  This also assumes a flat fee per transaction, if we compare the value of the vehicle to revenue this drops to being $0.0315 in revenue per dollar of value of the vehicle.

However, that's all we are able to see.  The *Net Income* has been masked by the pooled reporting approach for their various segments, especially Amrock.

The earlier comment of \~$0.30 was against the 2019 values of approximately $900M in net income dilluted against a 6% ownership stake with shares.  ($900M / (115372565 Shares / 0.06 Dilution factor) == $0.47 EPS for 2019 equivalent for Class A.  However, they had a major uptick in Q4 2019 and they were averaging much lower earlier in the year, hence $0.30.

1091,RKT, Unless that acquire a major player and get a leg up. That been my predictions for a while vroom being a very likely as they already have a major partnership with them. This is all speculation of course but has been stated by Dan that they wanted to go IPO and use shares to help buy other business and expand partnerships. I have a feeling they are holding some cards they are going to play in time. Dans went from pizza delivery boy to billionaire so I have faith. Autos looks a bit different if a they close out and buy carvanna or vroom. These cats are sitting on a lot of cash and as much as a like the dividend I would rather they spend it to grow the business.

1. S/He was already holding 400 QQQ shares (which was bought at a LOWER price than $336)  
2. S/He then SOLD 4 Put Option contracts at an expiry date of April 16 for a sell price of $336  
3. By virtue of SELLING Options, s/he RECEIVED money!   
4. Price of the Put option was hit - so s/he was FORCED to sell the shares at $336 - luckily, s/he ALREADY had 400 QQQ shares before selling the PUT options so the broker will just automatically sell the shares at $336 - if s/he DIDN'T have shares, the broker will BUY the shares at market price and sell immediately at $336 - in this case, looks like it doesn't matter as the share price closed pretty much at the option strike price - but imagine if the share price went down to $200 - the broker would BUY at $200 and SELL at $336!  
5. S/he collected the following tendies:  
Premium from SELLING the put options +  
Profit from selling shares at $336

For the SQ trades:

On the other hand QS is no Theranos. Theranos had a bunch of big names backing it, but almost none of them were people in the field and they had no idea what Theranos was doing apart from the layman explanations that the company was giving them. QS is co-founded by Fritz Prinz at Stanford, where he is an expert on solid state materials and battery materials. I think that being a senior faculty, he has a reputation to protect, especially on a topic in his field. Of course that doesn't guarantee anything but I think it sets them apart from Theranos.

In the end, if you are not well-versed with the physics of the technology itself, then you are kind of blindly investing in a project that you know nothing about, because there are no other ways of evaluating the company (financials etc).
