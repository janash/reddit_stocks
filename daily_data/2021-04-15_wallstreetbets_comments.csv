1,GME," What Is a Forfeited Share? (Copied by investopedia) 

A forfeited share is a share in a publicly-traded company that the owner loses (or forfeits) by neglecting to live up to any number of purchase requirements. For example, a forfeiture may occur if a shareholder fails to pay an owed allotment (call money), or if he sells or transfers his shares during a restricted period.

When a share is forfeited, the shareholder no longer owes any remaining balance and surrenders any potential capital gain on the shares, which automatically revert back to the ownership of the issuing company.

So Basically GME, the company, now has more revenue because they hold more shares and they won't be sold by the leaving CEO. So yeah 🚀",Recent-Maize7883,3776,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mr0shp/gamestop_forfeits_over_587000_shares_from_ceo_for/gujcroj/,0.104,0.728,0.168,0.7645

20,IT," Plenty of milquetoast business people to go around. In fact, the majority of people I have worked for and with in corporate America, even at the top, are pretty uninspiring and unimaginative. 

Business is so hard to figure out who is talented and who is not, since its almost impossible to create purely objective metrics. Everybody has a unique team, product, project, etc. Compare that to a swimmer or track athlete, which is purely objective its you vs the clock. No teammate and a clear metric of success that is the same for everybody in the world.

So in business you tend to just promote based on pedigree and the assumption of intellect (what degrees a person has, how they talk), appearance of work ethic and professionalism, and relationships. This is called the attribute substitution bias. 

There are people who excel at their job and do great, innovative work, but thats the exception. The majority of business is just getting shit done. Building a report, calling people to figure out how to move a project along, or entering data into an IT system. 

Even in middle management, you are spending more time as a chef cooking the food and less time creating new recipes/dishes and often times the simpler recipes make the most money.

Chik fil A makes far more money than 3 star restaraunts because it scales. So, the best performer is the one that follows the standard operating procedures, cleans, and is reliable at Chik Fil A and not the 3 star chef creating wacky new dishes. The CEO ends up being the person who figures out how to make the drive thru run faster and use less cooking oil in the fryer, not the chef creating braised kangaroo tail with a mung bean and pistachio puree.",bcuap10,42,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mr0shp/gamestop_forfeits_over_587000_shares_from_ceo_for/guk474y/,0.029,0.858,0.112,0.9672

53,GME," # Guys I can't believe some of you still dont understand.This will moon when AND ONLY WHEN there is a forced buyback 🤦🏻‍♂️

**How to achieve forced buyback?**  
1. Share recall  
2. Margin call  
3. Small raw buying pressure to push unhedged new options ITM so that hedging provides 'free' upward movement on TACTICAL MOMENTS ONLY.
4. Forced liquidation by DTCC  
5. Hard intervention by the SEC  


Unless one of these happens, the price can go anywhere.... and it doesn't matter if it's $200 or $40 a share...  

**Red days dont mean the squeeze is off, green days dont mean the squeeze is on. The price is fucking irrelevant (unless you're buying, then big red days are something to celebrate)**

You should stop caring. We've been saying this for months, but everytime we have a green day you guys want to celebrate and cheer because ""where lambo"" like a bunch of spoiled children.  And on red days you freak out way too much.


**Get fucking patient**  
For those 5 catalysts that I listed there are many things 'in the works'.  
The DTCC is spewing new regulations like a toddler that ate too much icecream.  
There is a shareholder vote 9th of June, GME hasn't released what we'll be voting on however.  
SEC just got a new head that is known to be anti hedgefund bullshit.  


**What is important?**  
\- Buy if you can. This determines how much exposure you have once we moon. More shares is more tendies.  
\- HOLD. Seriously. Don't daytrade, don't sell. Just hold. Doesn't matter if we're down 50% or up 40%. Stop giving a shit. This will only moon if there are not enough shares to go around. By holding, you are taking your shares and you're saying ""These are mine now. Less to go around"".   
\- Stop fucking promising yourselves dates. Especially if you're smoothbrained. Don't get excited at all. Stop it. You're setting yourself up for constant dissapointment which will paperhand you and ruin this for yourself. Yesterday I told you not to overcelebrate and I was told to fuck off and not ruin the fun. See where the fun yesterday got you? Totally (and without good reason) totally dissapointed today.

181,VIAC," Is that in writing?  Can he just make another pledge that he changed his mind and 100 million shares were sold on such and such a date, etc.  It's an interview, not some formal  prospectus  or something filed to the SEC.   That's a pledge by a CEO that gave himself a 100 percent raise during a pandemic and near bankruptcy of the company.

With Wanda selling their controlling voting shares, no one is minding the store.   He wouldn't have made this type of request if they were in control of the voting shares.  'Hey can you let the company have half your value in equity by giving us this blank check'.  Because if he did that the next thing they'd be voting on is a new CEO.

But that's the right thing to say by the CEO about this outrageous IMHO proposal, and I'm sure he probably means it at the time of saying it.  But his he really going to have access to 500 million shares, with the stock price high, with a chance at 4 billion in the coffers, or risk it going back down to a dollar in 2022.

183,AMC," From 12/31/2019 they had about 100M shares outstanding and now they have 400M outstanding (might be more). So a 4X increase in shares.

This stock traded at a little over $7 per share at 12/31/2019. Basically, as long as the fundamentals in the company are not improved, how we get to a current share price of $9.5 is beyond me. Just based on stock dilution alone we should be under $2 a share. $9.5 a share now is equivalent to $38 a share prior to dilution. In 2016 the share price hit around $35 before declining.

AMC during 2020 increased their debts (not sure if they paid it back with the shares sales in 2021) as well. Per the cash flow they generated $740M from debt financing in 2020.

Now I am not suggesting that bankruptcy is necessarily a current concern as there is a decent chance that some high demand to watch movies in theaters will help them short-term, but unless something improves on a massive scale about their business I don't understand the optimism about their share price.

In any case, no kidding he is promising not to sell those shares. As it is, this stock is insanely overvalued. Wanda America saw this and dropped the stock.

230,AMC," They already diluted the shares a massive amount this year. Just no new share dilution. They raised enough money to cover paying their bills for the rest of the year already. The question is what happens next year. In any case the share price is detached from reality so is bound to go down a significant amount sooner or later, barring some miraculous turnaround that would boost the company higher in value then it has ever been.

To put this in perspective, AMC is trading compared to the years pre-COVID at above its all-time highs, when you factor in share dilution. So to justify the current share price the company would not only need to meet its former high-marks (from back in 2016) it would have to exceed that.

237,AMC," He needs to give us more. There are worlds I could see 100% increase in outstanding being justified.

For example, if the company changed its executive compensation model to something like holding half the outstanding and paying dividends. The executives wouldn't own those shares, the company would. But executives would be compensated via dividends earned from those shares.

Or if AMC had a real long-term plan to enhance its value. Movie theaters are always going to exist. Home streaming is about as much of an existential threat as HBO was. People go to the movies for the experience of the big screen. But to justify such a new issuing, there needs to be some type of transformation.

Or if AMC had SUCH bad debt, if they don't raise the money they'll go bankrupt. Well, 100% dilution is better than bankruptcy for the shareholders. This might be the case, as AMC does have roughly 5 billion in debt. But throwing all the debt at the shareholders at once is a bit unnecessary.

249,GME," I have spent more time looking at GME and my takeaway is that while I think it is valued too high (I would not consider buying shares unless it went under $40) they are in a very different situation. 

For one, they did not need to raise funds to remain operational, in fact they recently announced they are paying back some debt. If they are raising funds (via any share sales... I am not sure the status of that though) it would be part of their plan to turn around the business.

They also recently had the whole top level of the business turned over and you have people with the experience now and drive to change this business in place. If they are successful, I think it is not hard to come up with valuations that justify the current price (but this is a big if).

I do remain skeptical that they will be able to change around the business and drive enough future profitability/cash flow to justify the current price (i.e. I think a value of essentially $10B+ on a nonexistent online business is a bit much, even with the brand recognition and great team in place) so remain bearish on them but would not advise anyone to bet against them (based on both the future prospects and the nature of the retail investors in it).

Interesting, could be the whole short-squeeze thing and the interest it is driving is a text book case in reflexivity. Shareholder support in this case allows or causes the business to turn around which in turn can make the business into a fundamentally valuable enterprise.",aka0007,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mr6gz5/amc_ceo_pledges_and_will_file_that_they_will_not/gule1ot/,0.022,0.868,0.11,0.9735

Let’s talk squeeze. Institutional + retail ownership is through the roof.  Short interest is debatable due to lack of clarity, but with ownership numbers alone a share recall will make waves.

256,AMC, Well do you know why it hit that all time high? Its because they issued more shares to finance the acquisition of several struggling movie chains. Saving them and their shareholders from bankruptcy. Why would they purposely dilute the shares of their company if it wasn't in the best interest of their shareholders and the company itself nc you have to remember that the AMC board of directors are all shareholders themselves. Right now AMC is set to come out of the pandemic as one of the top movie chains in the world and they are primed for a short squeeze right now if you look at all the data on ortex combined with the fact that their ceo just legally pledged to not issue anymore share in 2021.

260,AMC," I agree that there is always the possibility the business can turn around and go up in value. I am pretty much just going based on the dilution math and looking at the history that this company was in decline in the years leading up to COVID.

As to being short, I bought a little while back a few puts. Nothing significant (I really don't feel like taking the time to dig extensively into the company as the money I have involved here is not sufficient to justify spending much effort). I would not recommend anyone to short or buy puts as I think there is way too much a chance that retail investors keep on buying AMC and propping the price up for a while to come. My puts are a small lottery ticket that will only pay off if retail finally loses interest in propping up the share price.

I haven't done any research, but from simple observation, I'm expecting it to dip, probably as low as $7, maybe even $6, then I can buy, then it should come back up to about $12 or so.

263,AMC," The short squeeze seems pretty unlikely. On 3/31 the short shares were at 73.8M, against, I think, 450M shares outstanding (so about 16.5% short interest).

As to why they issued shares, I am not questioning that. They issued shares as they were facing bankruptcy due to being unable to get financing. Then retail jumped on AMC and drove the price up, making raising funds via share sales much easier. There is no mystery here. The end result is you still have the dilution. Dilution is a necessary evil for companies, not a benefit for shareholders.

>Won't you allow it..? Wall street is getting more and more into crypto (institutional adoption).

No, we won't allow it. Just a couple of reasons offhand:

1. It's a slippery slope as for what to include and what to exclude.

2. You don't need to explicitly talk about crypto to discuss stocks that deal with crypto. There was [a good example of a $COIN DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mr1za6/coin_150b_570share_price_target) that barely mentioned crypto at all. 

3. It's *really hard* to have a substantive discussion on crypto because the main talking points have been hashed to death.

4. If you thought GME was cultlike, crypto is infinitely moreso. I never thought a non-crypto community could so unabashedly try to pump and dump something, but I was proven wrong. I don't think anyone wants to go through that again. 

5. Lack of regulation. Unlike stock markets which require all sorts of transparency measures like ownership disclosures, crypto has none of that. Not to say these measures don't fail (Wirecard) but they're significantly better than nothing.

6. It makes our community WAY MORE attractive for bad actors. We barely let anyone's side project in, but imagine if one got past us that also stole people's wallets? It would be a disaster. 

7. Crypto subs have to deal with an absolutely insane amount of highly capable scammers. I don't know if we could keep up.

8. The use of leverage means that anyone could very easily ""fake"" a YOLO post. 

> I thought that was WSB. Not just some community that purposefully handicaps earnings and stifles information.

I'm not sure where this sentiment is coming from. There are plenty of other subs that allow crypto, and it's cool if that's your thing, but WSB isn't the place for it. 

It's arguably better that people go to r/CryptoCurrency or whichever sub best suits them, rather than dividing things even further and diluting the discussion. Not every sub has to include crypto. 

That said, we should really get back to posting the weekly earnings threads.

---

And look, I know this isn't what some of you were hoping for, but we basically have a choice to make, to keep striving to be the best at what we are, or to dilute ourselves and open up to ""normies"".

The last thing we want is to become a hivemind, because *that* is how good discussion dies. We were successful at keeping politics at bay, and it's been a huge part of the reason why WSB is doing well. We need to do the same for crypto because I've seen the discussion that tends to stem out of those communities, and it's almost identical. 

Finally, this is just my personal opinion, not that of the broader mod team, however, this is wide consensus that crypto is not something that will ever have a place on this sub.

My diamond balls will now allow me to never paper hand when I stop yoloing dumb shit. Many have felt worse losing less, and many have felt better than me while losing more.

I remember on my reddest day, I felt a pain and anxiety I haven't felt in years. I took a deep breath and remembered that I still have money, my health, my family, you know all that shit.

They restricted selling it so when it hit $400 no one could hit sell or buy. Then when the price had dropped to $200 you could sell it but not buy it.

So they didn't let you make money at $400 a share, but they would buy your shares at $200. Thing was, since no one could hit buy, everyone knew there was a shady entity actually buying the shares for the new artificially deflated price 50% less than opening bell.

That's what happened. That's why this op is such an idiot. He won't be able to make money when it does squeeze. RH won't let him sell until it stops.

572,ATH," **Daily Stock Market Forecast**

Things are looking bright and sunny today.

* Companies are smashing earnings expectations across the board
* Unemployment is dropping faster than expected. [Initial jobless claims](https://www.dol.gov/ui/data.pdf) were were 576,000, the lowest in more than a year, and well below the forecast of 710,000.
* [Retail sales](https://www.census.gov/retail/marts/www/marts_current.pdf) are booming, up 9.8% compared to a forecast 6.1%.

I'm forecasting a **green day** with a NASDAQ **high of 14,102** and a **low of 13,996**. 

That would put us just a little shy of ATH at today's peak.

*[I try to predict the NASDAQ every day.

810,ETH," Yeah. It's a *really* big deal. The whole 'programmable money' thing becomes real there. You're not exactly buying a weird piece of money or stock as much as you're buying an actual functional piece of the network they've built.

Smart contracts can enable impossible sounding things- by say, letting strangers collectively loan another stranger $100 million USD in funds to make arbitrage trades with no collateral, no ID, and all parties 100% guaranteed all agreed terms will be met or the contract doesn't execute, and no funds move. Any penalties or exit clauses are written in from the start, and the network itself holds the funds in escrow and disperses according to the terms.

If all contract terms are met, then the contract executes all trades as a single unit, and hundreds of millions can effectively 'teleport' in a single transaction between parties who do not need to trust one another to feel safe entering the contract if they like the terms written in the public code.

811,ID," Yeah. It's a *really* big deal. The whole 'programmable money' thing becomes real there. You're not exactly buying a weird piece of money or stock as much as you're buying an actual functional piece of the network they've built.

Smart contracts can enable impossible sounding things- by say, letting strangers collectively loan another stranger $100 million USD in funds to make arbitrage trades with no collateral, no ID, and all parties 100% guaranteed all agreed terms will be met or the contract doesn't execute, and no funds move. Any penalties or exit clauses are written in from the start, and the network itself holds the funds in escrow and disperses according to the terms.

814,IRL," The thing for me is that a difference of a 0.50% trade fee (Pro.Coinbase) vs. a 0.16% fee (Kraken) feels like it matters a lot less if I have zero intention to *ever* trade out most of the coins I collect. 

I plan to hold til I die (then pass them in my will), while I use the value as collateral *today* to fund my IRL investments/stuffing my retirement accounts with tax free, crypto-secured cash.

When you sell 'em, you get taxed out the ass. On the other hand, it's tax free to use the rising value as collateral with savings/loan places like /r/Nexo (who pay in-coin interest in the 5%+ range when you're not using the coins as collateral).

$COIN is starting to get into overcollateralized loans fully secured by crypto game too, and that is an *insane* money maker. Nexo has given out over $50 billion in loans in the last 2 years or so (99% of that being this last year). Google 'NexoStatistics' and check out that insane graph.

Ericsson has higher revenues and lower operating expenses resulting in better margins.

994,RKT," The refi market has already started to decrease 10%, the cashflow spike that they had in 2020 will not be maintained over the long term.  1)  there is a finite number of eligible refis in the first place and those continue to decrease when rates increase  2) there is a supply constraint in housing that is also limiting new purchases.

Prior to their boost in sales due to the refi-boom, their EPS for earnings attributed to the RKT common share holders was around $0.30.  Their stock price is trading around 75PE right now based on their normal income rates.  TLDR, they are not 4\~5x undervalued.

Many people are forgetting that the common shareholders only account for a 6% stake in ownership.  That 6% is represented as ""earnings attributed to RKT"" in their 10-k/10-q documents and are a large difference from their $9.4B profit (vs $9.4B \* 0.06 = $564M).

That comes out to be about \~$737 in *revenue* per car attributed to overall RKT holdings and about $44 attributed to common shareholders.  This also assumes a flat fee per transaction, if we compare the value of the vehicle to revenue this drops to being $0.0315 in revenue per dollar of value of the vehicle.

However, that's all we are able to see.  The *Net Income* has been masked by the pooled reporting approach for their various segments, especially Amrock.

I still think AMC is a risk in a sense the debt is insane and they have been vastly mismanaged the same as Cineworld and both are still in trouble to an extent.

But I’ve some shares for the squeeze we may see. End of the day that’s what we are all here for.

1215,SQ," For the QQQ trades :  
1. S/He was already holding 400 QQQ shares (which was bought at a LOWER price than $336)  
2. S/He then SOLD 4 Put Option contracts at an expiry date of April 16 for a sell price of $336  
3. By virtue of SELLING Options, s/he RECEIVED money!   
4. Price of the Put option was hit - so s/he was FORCED to sell the shares at $336 - luckily, s/he ALREADY had 400 QQQ shares before selling the PUT options so the broker will just automatically sell the shares at $336 - if s/he DIDN'T have shares, the broker will BUY the shares at market price and sell immediately at $336 - in this case, looks like it doesn't matter as the share price closed pretty much at the option strike price - but imagine if the share price went down to $200 - the broker would BUY at $200 and SELL at $336!  
5. S/he collected the following tendies:  
Premium from SELLING the put options +  
Profit from selling shares at $336

For the SQ trades:  
1. Again, s/he was already holding some SQ shares  
2. Sold 15 put options at a strike price of 250  
3. Sold 300 shares of SQ at $259.35  
4. BOUGHT 30 contracts of Put options at strike price of 260 expiry date of 7-May  
5. The following tendies were made :  
Premium for selling put options +  
Profit from selling 300 shares -  
Premiums paid for 30 put options   
6. Looks like s/he is still holding on to the 30 put options as they are in the money (strike price is greater than market price) - if s/he sells now, will make more tendies - if s/he holds, will make or lose tendies depending if share price goes up or down (s/he is hoping it goes down below $260",RedGreenBoy,5,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mr2svy/i_am_gayer_than_big_gay_al/gukujh6/,0.042,0.795,0.164,0.9887

In other words, if things are poppin off and both BlackRock and Fidelity have far fewer shares than we thought they did, there's that much less of a chance they'll cash out massive positions during the squeeze which means more shares are in the hands of Apes than previously thought.
