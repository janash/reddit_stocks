15,GDP," I know you didn’t ask for my TedTalk, but like DMX I’m “gonna give it to ya”. 

The system is set up to enrich the upper crust. Who is that? The banks mostly, but also businesses and whatever impacts the GDP directly. You can just call them the wealthy or top 1%. 

They’re the benefactors of quantitative easing. As well as the bailouts or stimulus. Sure, some of you apes got a $1200 check. Clap emoji. But that’s billions not trillions. The big T goes to the 1%. 

So basically the money is printed by the Fed for this QE (and stimuluses), which leads to inflation. BUT NOT DIRECTLY! (Loud ape noises) Not yet. For inflation to happen that money has to be circulated (measured by Velocity of Money). What does that mean? It means when apes get the money, it’s worth a lot less. That’s inflation. 

So the 1% gets the magically printed money before inflation when the purchasing power is high. Yay for them. We get it when it’s circulated and the purchasing power is affected by inflation making it much less. Boo for apes. 

Inflation is about 2% a year these days. That’s 20% every decade. So, for the apes in back, that means every 10 years all the money you put in savings loses 20% of its purchasing power. So you put $100k away in savings, then 10 years later it can purchase $80k what it could purchase when you put it in. This is the system. It wasn’t designed for apes. It was designed for them. 

So they get the money and what do they do with it? They invest, you big silly. The truly moronic of the apes think they just horde it and swim around in it like Scrooge McDuck. No. They invest. They invest mostly in businesses and real estate. Sometimes commodities. 

Now... enter the ape. Ape got money. Ape want to invest in these things too. That’s great! They like that! As long as you play by their rules. So they teach you about mutual funds for your 401k, etc. They let the middle class play the stacked game in the stock market, where they again teach you by telling you which stocks are hot on CNBC. 

They know how to manipulate this information so they always win and ape largely loses. (Loud ape noises) So Prometheus delivers ape the internet and ape learns to coordinate. Ape does what 1% does, only with money ape earned. Divided, ape’s money is worth much less because of inflation. They can’t invest like the 1%. The 1% knows this. This is the way it is intended. But together, the ape has more money than the 1%. Even when the purchasing power is weaker, ape has more of it because of their numbers. 

Now ape is manipulating the market through yolos. Ape is learning. Ape likes the stocks. 1% can’t stack the deck like they did, so they’re crying like petulant children and using the one thing they know can stop ape: fear. So they tell us we are gonna crash the market. They tell us ape is creating volatility. The entire system is volatile! But if they’re not the winners, then it’s suddenly unfair. And they tell us they’ll flip the game board over and it’ll be our fault for winning. 

Truth is, they still win most of the time. But they want to win all of the time.",dookiebuttholepeepee,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mqt06d/we_like_the_stock/guj8l5x/,0.073,0.786,0.141,0.9926

18,ANY," But when banks repackage subprime loans into collateralized debt obligations to mask the shitty bond rating of those loans, then someone else makes synthetic collateralized debt obligations using credit default swaps to bet 100x the value on the outcome of the original obfuscated CDO, then someone bets 100x the value on THAT bet until the entire real estate market is so over-leveraged that an 8% mortgage default rate—easily reached in an environment where mortgages are being written hand-over-fist to anyone who asks for one because the CDO market is so desperate for ANY mortgages to repackage and sell bets on because CDOs are basically printing money—results in a global cascade wiping out trillion of dollars in equity and bankrupting the “too big to fail” financial institutions who then freely accept bailouts using hundreds of billions in taxpayer money that they will NEVER pay back while the global economy burns to the ground, millions of Americans end up homeless, and unemployment hits 20%...no one gets held accountable. Not one person.

But we’re greedy because we buy a stock we like **and then do literally nothing else but HODL and post memes** and this is only an issue because some hedges thought they could make an easy buck shorting a vulnerable corporation into bankruptcy, robbing their shareholders, and putting 15,000 GameStop employees out of a job.",vendetta2115,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mqt06d/we_like_the_stock/gujsdan/,0.095,0.788,0.116,0.5279

31,GME," What Is a Forfeited Share? (Copied by investopedia) 

A forfeited share is a share in a publicly-traded company that the owner loses (or forfeits) by neglecting to live up to any number of purchase requirements. For example, a forfeiture may occur if a shareholder fails to pay an owed allotment (call money), or if he sells or transfers his shares during a restricted period.

When a share is forfeited, the shareholder no longer owes any remaining balance and surrenders any potential capital gain on the shares, which automatically revert back to the ownership of the issuing company.

49,IT," Plenty of milquetoast business people to go around. In fact, the majority of people I have worked for and with in corporate America, even at the top, are pretty uninspiring and unimaginative. 

Business is so hard to figure out who is talented and who is not, since its almost impossible to create purely objective metrics. Everybody has a unique team, product, project, etc. Compare that to a swimmer or track athlete, which is purely objective its you vs the clock. No teammate and a clear metric of success that is the same for everybody in the world.

So in business you tend to just promote based on pedigree and the assumption of intellect (what degrees a person has, how they talk), appearance of work ethic and professionalism, and relationships. This is called the attribute substitution bias. 

There are people who excel at their job and do great, innovative work, but thats the exception. The majority of business is just getting shit done. Building a report, calling people to figure out how to move a project along, or entering data into an IT system. 

Even in middle management, you are spending more time as a chef cooking the food and less time creating new recipes/dishes and often times the simpler recipes make the most money.

Chik fil A makes far more money than 3 star restaraunts because it scales. So, the best performer is the one that follows the standard operating procedures, cleans, and is reliable at Chik Fil A and not the 3 star chef creating wacky new dishes. The CEO ends up being the person who figures out how to make the drive thru run faster and use less cooking oil in the fryer, not the chef creating braised kangaroo tail with a mung bean and pistachio puree.",bcuap10,42,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mr0shp/gamestop_forfeits_over_587000_shares_from_ceo_for/guk474y/,0.029,0.858,0.112,0.9672

80,GME," # Guys I can't believe some of you still dont understand.This will moon when AND ONLY WHEN there is a forced buyback 🤦🏻‍♂️

**How to achieve forced buyback?**  
1. Share recall  
2. Margin call  
3. Small raw buying pressure to push unhedged new options ITM so that hedging provides 'free' upward movement on TACTICAL MOMENTS ONLY.
4. Forced liquidation by DTCC  
5. Hard intervention by the SEC  


Unless one of these happens, the price can go anywhere.... and it doesn't matter if it's $200 or $40 a share...  

**Red days dont mean the squeeze is off, green days dont mean the squeeze is on. The price is fucking irrelevant (unless you're buying, then big red days are something to celebrate)**

You should stop caring. We've been saying this for months, but everytime we have a green day you guys want to celebrate and cheer because ""where lambo"" like a bunch of spoiled children.  And on red days you freak out way too much.


**Get fucking patient**  
For those 5 catalysts that I listed there are many things 'in the works'.  
The DTCC is spewing new regulations like a toddler that ate too much icecream.  
There is a shareholder vote 9th of June, GME hasn't released what we'll be voting on however.  
SEC just got a new head that is known to be anti hedgefund bullshit.  


**What is important?**  
\- Buy if you can. This determines how much exposure you have once we moon. More shares is more tendies.  
\- HOLD. Seriously. Don't daytrade, don't sell. Just hold. Doesn't matter if we're down 50% or up 40%. Stop giving a shit. This will only moon if there are not enough shares to go around. By holding, you are taking your shares and you're saying ""These are mine now. Less to go around"".   
\- Stop fucking promising yourselves dates. Especially if you're smoothbrained. Don't get excited at all. Stop it. You're setting yourself up for constant dissapointment which will paperhand you and ruin this for yourself. Yesterday I told you not to overcelebrate and I was told to fuck off and not ruin the fun. See where the fun yesterday got you? Totally (and without good reason) totally dissapointed today.

When GME jumped from 40 the second time, the excruciating FOMO and dread of missing my chance hit me like a ton of bricks and I bought more than I originally did. 

During the drop from 340, I was nervous...but weirdly calm at the same time. Down to 110 and I was zen.

To put in in perspective, ICE and NASDAQ make about .01% per dollar. Coinbase has been able to charge 50x due to rapid retail consumption and a retail space that doesn't realize other options that are out there for obtaining coins. It is not a matter of saying I would want to get it for a little bit cheaper, I am talking at the very least 50% of the current valuation. Especially if you think the market for coins will continue to grow that is not exactly a bullish sentiment for current $COIN prices because this would motivate other competitors to enter the space. All it is going to take is 1 legitimate contender to $COIN's retail space for those 50x margins to deteriorate.

262,VIAC," Is that in writing?  Can he just make another pledge that he changed his mind and 100 million shares were sold on such and such a date, etc.  It's an interview, not some formal  prospectus  or something filed to the SEC.   That's a pledge by a CEO that gave himself a 100 percent raise during a pandemic and near bankruptcy of the company.

With Wanda selling their controlling voting shares, no one is minding the store.   He wouldn't have made this type of request if they were in control of the voting shares.  'Hey can you let the company have half your value in equity by giving us this blank check'.  Because if he did that the next thing they'd be voting on is a new CEO.

But that's the right thing to say by the CEO about this outrageous IMHO proposal, and I'm sure he probably means it at the time of saying it.  But his he really going to have access to 500 million shares, with the stock price high, with a chance at 4 billion in the coffers, or risk it going back down to a dollar in 2022.

Frankly if they do get 500 million shares, it probably would be better for their share holders if they sell it as quickly as possible.  Not having it be a Damocles' sword over the share price.

270,AMC," From 12/31/2019 they had about 100M shares outstanding and now they have 400M outstanding (might be more). So a 4X increase in shares.

This stock traded at a little over $7 per share at 12/31/2019. Basically, as long as the fundamentals in the company are not improved, how we get to a current share price of $9.5 is beyond me. Just based on stock dilution alone we should be under $2 a share. $9.5 a share now is equivalent to $38 a share prior to dilution. In 2016 the share price hit around $35 before declining.

AMC during 2020 increased their debts (not sure if they paid it back with the shares sales in 2021) as well. Per the cash flow they generated $740M from debt financing in 2020.

Now I am not suggesting that bankruptcy is necessarily a current concern as there is a decent chance that some high demand to watch movies in theaters will help them short-term, but unless something improves on a massive scale about their business I don't understand the optimism about their share price.

In any case, no kidding he is promising not to sell those shares. As it is, this stock is insanely overvalued. Wanda America saw this and dropped the stock.

306,AMC," They already diluted the shares a massive amount this year. Just no new share dilution. They raised enough money to cover paying their bills for the rest of the year already. The question is what happens next year. In any case the share price is detached from reality so is bound to go down a significant amount sooner or later, barring some miraculous turnaround that would boost the company higher in value then it has ever been.

To put this in perspective, AMC is trading compared to the years pre-COVID at above its all-time highs, when you factor in share dilution. So to justify the current share price the company would not only need to meet its former high-marks (from back in 2016) it would have to exceed that.

311,AMC," He needs to give us more. There are worlds I could see 100% increase in outstanding being justified.

For example, if the company changed its executive compensation model to something like holding half the outstanding and paying dividends. The executives wouldn't own those shares, the company would. But executives would be compensated via dividends earned from those shares.

Or if AMC had a real long-term plan to enhance its value. Movie theaters are always going to exist. Home streaming is about as much of an existential threat as HBO was. People go to the movies for the experience of the big screen. But to justify such a new issuing, there needs to be some type of transformation.

Or if AMC had SUCH bad debt, if they don't raise the money they'll go bankrupt. Well, 100% dilution is better than bankruptcy for the shareholders. This might be the case, as AMC does have roughly 5 billion in debt. But throwing all the debt at the shareholders at once is a bit unnecessary. 

Either way, shareholders should get value from the existence of those new shares. But this is not a ""Trust us"" situation, like I said it's poison for the stock price.",ShadowyInsights,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mr6gz5/amc_ceo_pledges_and_will_file_that_they_will_not/gul2vzf/,0.162,0.728,0.11,-0.9452

But issuing 4x the amount of shares is wildly horrible. And now they want to vote to issue even more for 2022??? And people are cheering st this video?? That's legit retardation, not the good fun autist thinking employed here. 

So I think you're joking. Becuase you don't need to dilute stock in order to merge or buyout another company. And just becuase you do buyout another company, doesn't mean it always works out and ""double or triples""  the stock price.

322,GME," I have spent more time looking at GME and my takeaway is that while I think it is valued too high (I would not consider buying shares unless it went under $40) they are in a very different situation. 

For one, they did not need to raise funds to remain operational, in fact they recently announced they are paying back some debt. If they are raising funds (via any share sales... I am not sure the status of that though) it would be part of their plan to turn around the business.

They also recently had the whole top level of the business turned over and you have people with the experience now and drive to change this business in place. If they are successful, I think it is not hard to come up with valuations that justify the current price (but this is a big if).

I do remain skeptical that they will be able to change around the business and drive enough future profitability/cash flow to justify the current price (i.e. I think a value of essentially $10B+ on a nonexistent online business is a bit much, even with the brand recognition and great team in place) so remain bearish on them but would not advise anyone to bet against them (based on both the future prospects and the nature of the retail investors in it).

Interesting, could be the whole short-squeeze thing and the interest it is driving is a text book case in reflexivity. Shareholder support in this case allows or causes the business to turn around which in turn can make the business into a fundamentally valuable enterprise.",aka0007,-2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mr6gz5/amc_ceo_pledges_and_will_file_that_they_will_not/gule1ot/,0.022,0.868,0.11,0.9735

329,AMC, Well do you know why it hit that all time high? Its because they issued more shares to finance the acquisition of several struggling movie chains. Saving them and their shareholders from bankruptcy. Why would they purposely dilute the shares of their company if it wasn't in the best interest of their shareholders and the company itself nc you have to remember that the AMC board of directors are all shareholders themselves. Right now AMC is set to come out of the pandemic as one of the top movie chains in the world and they are primed for a short squeeze right now if you look at all the data on ortex combined with the fact that their ceo just legally pledged to not issue anymore share in 2021.

337,AMC," I agree that there is always the possibility the business can turn around and go up in value. I am pretty much just going based on the dilution math and looking at the history that this company was in decline in the years leading up to COVID.

As to being short, I bought a little while back a few puts. Nothing significant (I really don't feel like taking the time to dig extensively into the company as the money I have involved here is not sufficient to justify spending much effort). I would not recommend anyone to short or buy puts as I think there is way too much a chance that retail investors keep on buying AMC and propping the price up for a while to come. My puts are a small lottery ticket that will only pay off if retail finally loses interest in propping up the share price.

As to why they issued shares, I am not questioning that. They issued shares as they were facing bankruptcy due to being unable to get financing. Then retail jumped on AMC and drove the price up, making raising funds via share sales much easier. There is no mystery here. The end result is you still have the dilution.

So some people were kinda pissed, some were super pissed but everyone then interpreted that the higher paid people were more pissed.

370,NMS," Since 2000, the Securities and Exchange Commission has required brokerage firms to file a quarterly report showing where they are routing their stock trades for execution. The filing is known as a 606 report after Rule 606 of Regulation NMS (National Market System). Because so many traders at Reddit’s WallStreetBets’ message board have focused on the fact that billionaire Ken Griffin’s Citadel Securities was executing the majority of trades for Robinhood, the trading app where a lot of the Redditors directed their GameStop trades, we decided to take a look at what other online brokers might have also been directing GameStop trades to Citadel Securities.

According to the 606 reports for the fourth quarter of 2020 for the following nine online brokers, Citadel was providing payment-for-order-flow (giving a cash rebate for trade orders directed to it) to each of the following: Robinhood, E-Trade, TD Ameritrade, Charles Schwab, WeBull, Ally Invest Securities, First Trade and TradeStation. At Fidelity Brokerage Services, it was directing stock and option orders to Citadel Securities but was only receiving payment-for-order-flow on the option orders, according to its 606 report.

According to these 606 reports, Citadel ranked as the number one venue for sending both stock and option orders at the following firms: Robinhood, TD Ameritrade, Charles Schwab, WeBull, Fidelity Brokerage Services and Ally Invest Securities. Citadel was the number one venue for options trades by E-Trade while ranking lower for stock trades. At First Trade and TradeStation, Citadel ranked number one for market orders for stocks (trades with no stated price limit) and number one for options.

The bottom line here: there was a high probability that no matter what online brokerage firm Redditors sent their GameStop orders to initially, Ken Griffin’s Citadel Securities was getting a piece of the action in the end. According to the website of Citadel Securities, “To maximize trading opportunities for clients, our automated trading platform sources liquidity from all U.S. exchanges and more than 18 alternative liquidity venues.”

That last sentence is what investigators want to look at. That is, what is the final destination of all of these Citadel Securities trades. “Alternative liquidity venues” may include Dark Pools which are in desperate need of some sunshine. (See GameStop Shares: Dark Pools Owned by Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, UBS, et al, Have Made Tens of Thousands of Trades.)

Pay to play in the trading world has worked out very well for Griffin. According to Forbes, as of today, Griffin’s net worth is $15 billion. Forbes reported Griffin’s wealth at just $7.6 billion less than five years ago.

All that dough sloshing around in Griffin’s bank accounts has found some interesting destinations. Just ask U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. Citadel paid Yellen $992,500 for speaking gigs since she stepped down as Fed Chair in February of 2018. Two of those events, on October 17, 2019 and December 3, 2019, commanded $292,500 each. Then, at the height of the pandemic in October 2020, Citadel paid Yellen $337,500 in total to speak at unspecified events on October 9; October 20; October 26; and October 27. Yellen’s disclosure form also lists a liability to Citadel of “$50,001 to $100,000,” owed as a refund for a cancelled event. Why she hasn’t paid that back yet is curious. [See updated information at end of this article.]

All of this comes from the jaw-dropping financial disclosure form that Yellen filed with the (try to contain your laughter) Office of Government Ethics in advance of her Senate Finance Committee Confirmation Hearing to become the U.S. Treasury Secretary.

Yellen’s cash haul for speaking gigs in 2019 and 2020 came to more than $7 million, with most of that coming from Wall Street firms and hedge funds. Yellen did not disclose her speaking fees in 2018.

Yellen is now rumored to be hauling together the SEC, the Fed, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission this week to look into the trading in GameStop. In a rational world, Yellen would have to recuse herself from any matter involving Citadel. But when it comes to matters involving Wall Street, we left that rational world in 1999 with the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act which allowed giant federally-insured banks to merge with Wall Street’s casino trading firms for the first time since 1933.

388,IR," Yes, that's called making markets. They don't profit off of the direction of those indices, they profit off of fees and commissions and the premium they get on the bid ask spread (which partially offsets their credit risk). 

As a tangible example, let's say some huge corporation sells bonds and wants to offset interest rate risk so they enter into an interest rate swap. It's highly unlikely they are going to find a counter party to enter a bi lateral agreement with, and if they did they would have to take on the credit risk of the counter party.

463,IEX," IEX is great.

You are wrong that it would force MMs to trade at the midpoint though.  That would be crazy.  This is just about order book priority.

Also unless you are paying a commission on your trades this is unlikely to affect you; most commission-free brokerages use PFOF.  Fidelity is the exception (for stock trades), but I'm not sure if they route to IEX.",Keith_13,38,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mqtpcd/new_sec_filing_from_iex_seeking_to_overhaul_and/gui37e8/,0.09,0.873,0.037,-0.3905
464,IEX," No, this does not force the broker to enter an order at the midpoint. 

We are all familiar with market and limit orders.  Limit orders are ""displayed""; that is, if you make limit order to buy at $10 and it doesn't execute, but it's higher than the other limit buy orders, the displayed bid will be $10.  If it's not the best bid it will still be in the order book, visible as level 2 data.

But there are other order types.  IEX offers a ""midpoint peg"" order price.  It's not displayed (it can't be, because it doesn't have a fixed price).  How it works is that it's pegged to the midpoint of the displayed bid and the ask.

So if the bid is $10 and the ask is $10.10, and you place a missing peg buy order, you have a ""hidden"" bid of $10.05.  No one else knows about it.  So if someone makes a market sell order you will fill at $10.05.  If someone makes a limit sell order for $10.04 you will fill at $10.05. 

On the other hand if someone makes a limit sell at 10.08, that will be the new ask and your order will automatically adjust to $10.04 (it's pegged to the midpoint)

The part about the price being manipulated at lower and lower prices is tinfoil hat conspiracy theory nonsense.  You completely miss the point.  What IEX is allowing you, as a buyer, to do with this order type is fill at a lower price. This is what buyers want -- to fill at the lowest price possible.

You seem to think that MMs want to sell to you at as low of a price as possible to keep the price artificially depressed.  That's pants-on-head retarded.  What MMs want is to sell to you at as high of a price as possible because that's how they make money.",Keith_13,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mqtpcd/new_sec_filing_from_iex_seeking_to_overhaul_and/guiwew4/,0.145,0.83,0.025,-0.9917

 Neuer SEC-Antrag der IEX zur Überarbeitung und Verbesserung der Fairness bei der Ausführung von Trades für Kleinanleger.

Der Zweck der vorgeschlagenen Regeländerung ist es, das Retail Price Improvement Program der Börse zum Nutzen der Kleinanleger zu verbessern. Konkret schlägt die Börse vor, die folgenden vier Änderungen vorzunehmen: (i) Überarbeitung der Definition des Begriffs ""Retail-Order"" in der IEX-Regel 11. 190(b)(15) dahingehend zu ändern, dass sie sich nur auf das Handelsinteresse einer natürlichen Person bezieht, die im Durchschnitt eines Kalendermonats nicht mehr als 390 Aktienaufträge pro Tag für ihr(e) eigenes(n) wirtschaftliches(n) Konto(en) platziert;7 (ii) Orderbuch8-Priorität für Retail Liquidity Provider (""RLP"")-Aufträge9 zum Midpoint Price10 vor anderen nicht angezeigten Aufträgen, die zum Midpoint Price ausgeführt werden sollen, zu gewähren; (iii) eine ""Retail Liquidity Identifier"" über die börseneigenen Marktdatenfeeds und den entsprechenden Wertpapierinformationsprozessor (""SIP"") zu verbreiten, wenn RLP-Orderinteresse, das zu mindestens einem Round Lot für ein bestimmtes Wertpapier aggregiert ist, im System verfügbar ist,11 vorausgesetzt, das RLP-Orderinteresse ruht zum Midpoint Price und ist preislich mindestens $0. 001 besser als der NBB12 oder NBO13 ist; und (iv) die Definition von RLP-Orders so zu ändern, dass solche Orders nur Midpoint Peg Orders sein können,14 keine Discretionary Peg Orders sein können,15 und keine Mindestmengenbeschränkung enthalten können.16 Die vorgeschlagenen Änderungen sollen die Fähigkeit nicht-professioneller Kleinanleger, eine sinnvolle Preisverbesserung zu erzielen, weiter unterstützen und verbessern, indem Anreize für die Marktteilnehmer geschaffen werden, miteinander zu konkurrieren, um eine solche Preisverbesserung anzubieten. 

Retail Liquidity Provider bezeichnet einen Broker, der Retail-Orders über die IEX leitet. Sie können Ihren Broker anrufen und nachfragen, ob er ein RLP für die IEX ist. 

Die größte Änderung hier ist ii oben aufgeführt. Dies negiert komplett die Möglichkeit für andere Firmen, Retail-Orders vor der Ausführung zu sehen und dann entsprechend zu handeln, um den Preis zu manipulieren. Dies würde Retail-Orders Vorrang vor anderen, nicht angezeigten Orders geben. Es würde auch dazu führen, dass Market Orders gezwungen werden, zum Midpoint-Preis (d.h. zwischen Ask und Bid) zu handeln. Zuvor konnte dies manipuliert werden, um den Preis zu senken, indem Aufträge konsequent zu immer niedrigeren Preisen ausgeführt wurden, so dass der Preis sank, obwohl die Leute kauften. 

Lesen Sie einige der DD, um ein wenig darüber zu erfahren, wie nicht angezeigte Orders wahrscheinlich von Citadel und Freunden verwendet werden, um den Preis zu manipulieren. Insgesamt scheint es ein großer Schritt in die richtige Richtung zu sein, um das Spielfeld auszugleichen. Es sieht so aus, als ob es vor der Genehmigung durch die traditionelle Kommentarperiode gehen muss. (Nicht eine Vorankündigung).

TL;DR: Dies negiert vollständig die Möglichkeit für andere Firmen, Privatkundenaufträge vor der Ausführung zu sehen und dann entsprechend zu handeln, um den Preis zu manipulieren. Dies würde Privatkundenaufträgen Vorrang vor anderen nicht angezeigten Aufträgen geben. Es würde den Broker auch dazu zwingen, den Handel zum Midpoint-Preis (d.h. zwischen Ask und Bid) einzugeben. Zuvor konnte dies manipuliert werden, um den Preis zu senken, indem Aufträge konsequent zu immer niedrigeren Preisen ausgeführt wurden, so dass der Preis fiel, obwohl die Leute kauften.

475,IBKR," Yes exactly, you are right about when your get fill.  That's adverse selection.

This helps avoid adverse selection.   If you did it yourself with a script, you would still get your standing limit orders picked off because they are displayed.  Also you would just be way too slow; this is why the HFTs pay the big bucks to have a  direct connection to the exchange (except IEX).  They want to pick your order off before you can change it.

You should also look into the D-peg order if you are concerned about adverse selection.

By the way, neither of these order types are new.  You can use them with IBKR Pro, and probably several other brokers as well (though I don't know which ones)",Keith_13,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mqtpcd/new_sec_filing_from_iex_seeking_to_overhaul_and/guk2nos/,0.084,0.85,0.066,-0.34
476,IEX," MMs generally try to remain hedged and try to avoid taking large directional positions.  Stop believing everything you read here and start using your brain.

If they did have a big short position, selling more at lower prices would just make their situation worse.   If their book starts to get lopsided (short) their bids and asks go up, not down, so they can unwind.  Again, their goal is to remain balanced so they can continue to fleece you on the spread.

Anyway this trade type has nothing to do with any of this.  First of all it's not new; the part that's new is that they are moving retail midpoint peg orders to the front of their book.  Second, when they say that it offers buyers improved execution they mean that the buyers are able to buy at a lower price, because that's what a price improvement is for a buyer.

If you want to buy at the ask just place market orders; that's not new.  The point of the midpoint peg order is that you can get in lower than the ask without leaving a standing limit order there to be picked off when the price drops.  That's the main issue with limit orders; there's a lot of adverse selection.  You don't get fill until your limit is a ""bad"" price.   It's sitting out there for the world to see and when the MM finally agrees to fill at that price you know that it's not a good price any more, and you can't back away fast enough because they are HFTs and you are not.  That's how they make money, and it's what IEX is trying to solve. The D-peg order (also from IEX) tries to solve this problem in a different way, but it's all about making sure that you can buy at a price that's not ""too high"".",Keith_13,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mqtpcd/new_sec_filing_from_iex_seeking_to_overhaul_and/gujobvb/,0.051,0.91,0.039,-0.3885

485,ABC," I’d like to answer this as simply as possible. When you buy shares you own the shares. 

When you buy an option contract call (expecting it to go up) or a put (expecting it to go down, it’s essentially shorting a stock but your not borrowing shares both calls and puts you can only lose you’re premium or initial investment)

All contracts are 100 shares, typically the cost per share of a contract is %10 of the cost of a share. But implied volatility (how volatile the stock is moving) can affect the premium price per share and could be much higher or lower then 10% of a share price. Ex: stock ABC share is priced at $10. The cost of the contract would be $1 per share. 1x contract of 100 shares would cost $100 which is the premium.

The strike price is the price point that your buying the option for. The strike price also determines the cost of the option contract. Let’s say for stock ABC you buy a call option with a strike price of $105. This would mean if stock ABC is currently at $100 you can only execute your option contract once the stock price hits $105. This would be considered break even or ITM (in the money) if the stock went down to $90 from $100 this would be considered OTM (out the money) currently sitting at a loss unless the stock price goes up. Same concept for a put (Short) if you buy a put at $100 you’re hoping the price goes down, the more the price goes down the more profit and ITM (in the money) you are, if the price goes above your strike price of $100 because it’s a put (short) this would be the opposite of a call option and would mean you’re sitting at a loss unless the price goes below your strike price.

Now, this is the important thing to understand about options. There’s two values to options. When you have an option contract whether a call or a put, the strike price is also when you’re allowed to execute you options contract to purchase 100 shares. So, if I had a call option with a strike price of $105 and the stock is now at $150, I can execute my contract to purchase 100 shares at $105. Now,if you execute to buy those shares you also have to factor in the cost of contract (premium) to get how much it cost per share. 

Ex: 1x Call option with a strike price of $100. The stock is currently trading for $150. The cost of the contract was let’s say %10 of the share price, so 1 contract would cost $1000. The stock now goes up to $150 and you execute your contract so you buy 100 shares at $100 a share (strike price) which = $10,000.00. The premium was $1000. So, you would divide the premium price by the amount of shares to get the average price per share including the premium you paid. Ex: $10 per share*100= $1000 (Premium/Cost of contract) , $1000/100 shares = $10 per share. So after executing your contract to buy 100 shares at $100 it would actually cost you $110 per share when you factor in your premium price for the contract. Now remember in this example the shares are going for $150, the price has gone up, but by executing your contract you were able to buy those shares at $100. This is the principle of an option contract. Now, what I just explained to you is what you can do with an option contract (Purchase the shares at the strike price) but almost no one does this.

Now we go into the 2nd value of an options contract and how people trade it.

The contract itself is valuable (You don’t need to execute and buy the shares, you can just sell the option contract just like a stock).

So, let’s say you bought an option contract of stock ABC which is trading at $100 a share. The contract is $1000 which means $10 per share and a contract is always 100 shares, so the contract cost $1000. Now let’s say, the stock went up to $150. Your contract is now valued at $22 per share, or $2200.00. You can now sell your contract at a profit of $2200. Profit - premium. $2200 - $1000 price of contract when you bought it = $1200 profit.

Most people who buy options buy and sell their contracts to make a profit. Most people don’t actually execute their contract to actually buy the shares, but this is an option you can do which is called “exercising” your contract. This is done with you’re broker and you typically need to call them to request this to be done, but again most people never do this and your not obliged to “exercise” your contract, but you can if you wanted to.

The date of the contract. The date is when the contract needs to or will be automatically exercised by your broker if you don’t exercise or sell  your contract yourself. So, let’s say you bought an option at $1 per share but now the contract is only worth $.50 per share, well you lost half of your premium or investment. $100 contract is now worth $50, so your broker will execute your contract for you on that date or if you don’t have enough funds to exercise your contract your broker will sell your options contract on the closing date if you haven’t already.

Most people buy and sell options to make a profit on the premium cost of the contract. If you buy a call option and the price of the share goes up from the strike price, your contract price/value has increased and your making profits. If the share price goes down from  strike price your starting to incur losses. The same is for puts but in reverse.

The strike price is when your able to exercise your contract (Actually buy 100 shares at the strike price point), you can sell your contract whenever you want, this is not determined by the strike price.

I hope this helps a bit.

486,ABC," Bro. A option is a contract that at a certain date it allows you to purchase 100 shares of ABC stock. If you keep the contract, and the call reaches the strike price you can exercise it and get those 100 shares. 

The price of the contract is based on how ambitious your bet is. If the stock is at $20 and the call (contract that bets on the stock going up) has a strike price of $21, then that would be more expensive than one that had a much higher price. The timing matters too but in the same way with regards to risk. 

Puts are just the opposite. It’s a bet on the stock to go down.

490,GME," When he brought the contract the price of it was cheaper as the share price of GME was lower than the current share price. 

For example, if he brought it say one month ago and the cost of 1 contract was say 2000 (each contract has a 100 shares- 20*100). But over this time the as the share price of GME increased the value of those contract increases as well, the intrinsic value as it getting closer to the strike price although the contract is losing extrinsic value too (deta i.e time dacay as the contract is getting closer to the expiry date). In the case of GME has a high volatility (big changes in share price in small amounts of time), this gives this contract the increase in price you see. This contract now is no longer worth the 2000 he paid. It's now worth 4500 (45*100).

Hope this makes sense. Lots of YouTube videos u can watch to better understand it. He can close his position now and take his profit in which case he sells the contract to someone else or if he think the price will get higher than 220 ( strike price + cost of each share of contract) at the expiry date to either close or exercise",Desperatelyseekingan,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mqvh6o/picked_up_some_calls_during_those_dips_this_week/guj4egn/,0.046,0.76,0.193,0.9869

495,ABC," So in your example If you bought a call option on ABC that was trading at 100 for 10 premium per share and the price per share went to 150 at 22 premium, instead of selling the contract and making 1200 profit wouldn't you be better off exercising your contract, getting 100 shares at 100$ each and then just selling them on the market for 150$ making 4000 profit?

Am I overthinking this or are your numbers more examples and there is a lot more at play like iv and theta? I suppose if your contract had say another week before it expired the potential for the stock to go even above 150 is still there and in a sense you are also paying for the time remaining on the contract. It wouldn't make sense to exercise even at 150 with so much time remaining on the contract that you essentially paid for when you bought the contract at that premium.

502,GME," Exactly, call is when you expect the price to go up and put is when you expect it to go down. Using GME for example you can see that option contracts can be fairly expensive depending on the dates you chose. This is because GME is super volatile and that’s factored into the price of the contract by Money Makers or MM and your brokers. This is called implied volatility and this has a big impact on the price of an options contract. Also, very important when you buy a contract and you see the price from your brokerage account make sure to use a limit buy order as the prices changes frequently depending on how the stock is moving. Ex: let’s say you don’t use a limit order.  It says that the contract is $1 per share so $100 for the contract. But while you’re looking at that contract the stock price went up %10 now the contract cost $2.5 per share or $250. If you did a market buy you would have bought the same contract that you thought was priced a $1 per share or $100 for the contract for $2.5 per share or $250 because of the stock moving up so quickly. So remember, always use limit buy order to set the price you want to buy the contract for to avoid this issue from occurring.

The options contracts will always be priced as a per share value, so to find out how much the contract will cost you always have to multiply the contract price (value per share) by 100 ( An option contract will always be 100 shares).",ShortChecker,27,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mqvh6o/picked_up_some_calls_during_those_dips_this_week/gujoccm/,0.01,0.908,0.082,0.9451
503,ABC," It does, when you sell (write) a call option, your putting up your stocks as collateral. So, if the stock price doesn’t go below the strike price or break even, you would then have to sell your shares at the strike price of the contract if the buyer of your call option exercises the contract. If it’s below the strike price or at break even typically the stock is worthless and you get to keep the whole premium as a gain.

Now, selling a put option is different. You don’t actually have to own the shares. Writing a put option means you contractually agree that if the price goes below the strike price you have to buy the shares at that strike price of the contract. Technically, selling (writing) a put option has unlimited risk. Well unlimited being in the sense that if stock ABC is valued at $50, and you write a put contract for $45 priced at $2, if the price were to crash to zero, you’d have to pay the buyer of your contract 100 shares of $45 = $4,500. The max gain you could have got from writing the put option was only $200. So, you have to be very careful with selling (writing) put options. They’re typically used to hedge a short position or “cover” a short. 

Writing a call option, the loss can be the difference between the stock price when the buyer exercise versus the value of the stock. So, let’s say I write a call option for $55 at a cost of $2 per share which is the premium, if the stock drops to 25$, you have a loss of $30 per share or $3000.00 because now you have to sell your shares at the strike price to the buyer of your contract. If let’s say the price goes above $53 that’s the break even point or profit point for call sellers because the contract would be deemed worthless. Break even point is $53 because the premium is at $2 per share.

Now, buying options whether a call or put is fairly simple and the potential loss is limited to your premium price, but selling (writing) contracts are a little more complex and for selling (writing) a put, it can carry unlimited loss (If the stock price goes to zero for example). So, for writing options, definitely take the time you really understand it before writing them. Especially for a put as the loss can be big.

Writing a call option - Your putting your stock up as collateral, as a call option seller, you hope the price goes down from the strike price.

Writing a put option - You contractually agree to buy the shares at the strike price if the contract you wrote is out of the money for you as a seller. As a put seller, you hope the price goes up from the strike price.

Ex: I sell a put option with a strike price of $50. If the stock price drops to $10 a share, the buyer of my contract can and will exercise it, once they do that I now have to buy 100 shares at $50 for the buyer when the stock is valued only at $10.",ShortChecker,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mqvh6o/picked_up_some_calls_during_those_dips_this_week/gulidpu/,0.063,0.839,0.098,0.9719

>Won't you allow it..? Wall street is getting more and more into crypto (institutional adoption).

No, we won't allow it. Just a couple of reasons offhand:

1. It's a slippery slope as for what to include and what to exclude.

2. You don't need to explicitly talk about crypto to discuss stocks that deal with crypto. There was [a good example of a $COIN DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mr1za6/coin_150b_570share_price_target) that barely mentioned crypto at all. 

3. It's *really hard* to have a substantive discussion on crypto because the main talking points have been hashed to death.

4. If you thought GME was cultlike, crypto is infinitely moreso. I never thought a non-crypto community could so unabashedly try to pump and dump something, but I was proven wrong. I don't think anyone wants to go through that again. 

5. Lack of regulation. Unlike stock markets which require all sorts of transparency measures like ownership disclosures, crypto has none of that. Not to say these measures don't fail (Wirecard) but they're significantly better than nothing.

6. It makes our community WAY MORE attractive for bad actors. We barely let anyone's side project in, but imagine if one got past us that also stole people's wallets? It would be a disaster. 

7. Crypto subs have to deal with an absolutely insane amount of highly capable scammers. I don't know if we could keep up.

8. The use of leverage means that anyone could very easily ""fake"" a YOLO post. 

> I thought that was WSB. Not just some community that purposefully handicaps earnings and stifles information.

I'm not sure where this sentiment is coming from. There are plenty of other subs that allow crypto, and it's cool if that's your thing, but WSB isn't the place for it. 

It's arguably better that people go to r/CryptoCurrency or whichever sub best suits them, rather than dividing things even further and diluting the discussion. Not every sub has to include crypto. 

That said, we should really get back to posting the weekly earnings threads.

---

And look, I know this isn't what some of you were hoping for, but we basically have a choice to make, to keep striving to be the best at what we are, or to dilute ourselves and open up to ""normies"".

The last thing we want is to become a hivemind, because *that* is how good discussion dies. We were successful at keeping politics at bay, and it's been a huge part of the reason why WSB is doing well. We need to do the same for crypto because I've seen the discussion that tends to stem out of those communities, and it's almost identical. 

Finally, this is just my personal opinion, not that of the broader mod team, however, this is wide consensus that crypto is not something that will ever have a place on this sub.

606,GME," To reply to your original question:

You've spent more than 100 shares cost for the permission to buy shares at a higher price than now, less than a year from now.

I think it's smarter to buy 100 shares and sell covered calls against it. I'm not expecting rockets, just swings, so high short term IV.

I guess with what you have, what could do is sell $200 calls against your position and if/when GME gets that high just roll them up and out a week to like 220, then 240, etc until the time cost isn't worth it or they expire worthless.

I kept rolling a 110 call for a credit to 240 over a month so I'm sure you can keep doing that here as well.",jimbofbx,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mr50o5/gme_am_i_doing_this_right_plan_to_these_babies/gukvnc0/,0.034,0.8,0.166,0.9423

I risk 14,000 because I'd have to buy 200 shares of GME if it falls below 40. 100 shares @ $40/share and 100 shares @ $100/share.

608,GME," Its a bear move right now for a couple of reasons. The first, he's anticipating the price will never reach 400. Two, if a market maker sells a call, they hedge it by  buying delta \* number of call contracts \* 100 = number of shares of GME.

610,PT, Yeah basically the way I see it is if you want to own stock you should sell puts and collect premium until the price falls and you can own it.

Biggest threat to me is if starts climbing and couldn't get out of my call I'd have to just leave it and buy 100 more shares, not like I'd lose money, it's still way more than I bought them for, could just use my margin to get more back while waiting for the sale to clear.",Raptor851,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mr50o5/gme_am_i_doing_this_right_plan_to_these_babies/gukntzu/,0.048,0.798,0.154,0.9488

During the end of each cycle, volume decreases, even after hitting a new floor in the asset. Now that would be for one asset and I believe COIN has about 30 different assets tied to USD and stable coins. With the cycle we are currently in, it is possible that this time around revenue stream could be sustainable and this particular cycle may be different compared to the last two cycles in which the sell offs might be of a lesser degree where the biggest crypto asset in the world might just drop to 50% instead of the 80% the asset is use to during a huge sell off or at the end of a bull cycle.

829,ETH," Yeah. It's a *really* big deal. The whole 'programmable money' thing becomes real there. You're not exactly buying a weird piece of money or stock as much as you're buying an actual functional piece of the network they've built.

Smart contracts can enable impossible sounding things- by say, letting strangers collectively loan another stranger $100 million USD in funds to make arbitrage trades with no collateral, no ID, and all parties 100% guaranteed all agreed terms will be met or the contract doesn't execute, and no funds move. Any penalties or exit clauses are written in from the start, and the network itself holds the funds in escrow and disperses according to the terms.

If all contract terms are met, then the contract executes all trades as a single unit, and hundreds of millions can effectively 'teleport' in a single transaction between parties who do not need to trust one another to feel safe entering the contract if they like the terms written in the public code.

That's just one thing they've been used for (that's AAVE's ""Flash Loans"" service- anyone who can come up with a 'good' trade has access to hundreds of millions).

Things are looking bright and sunny today.

* Companies are smashing earnings expectations across the board
* Unemployment is dropping faster than expected. [Initial jobless claims](https://www.dol.gov/ui/data.pdf) were were 576,000, the lowest in more than a year, and well below the forecast of 710,000.
* [Retail sales](https://www.census.gov/retail/marts/www/marts_current.pdf) are booming, up 9.8% compared to a forecast 6.1%.

I'm forecasting a **green day** with a NASDAQ **high of 14,102** and a **low of 13,996**. 

That would put us just a little shy of ATH at today's peak.

Red.  Red.  Red.  His hysterical wife screamed at him, her bf whipped him over and over with his belt.  Each day his madness grew but he refused to sell.   Eventually he believed so much that he was right, he stole the bf's car, and drove as far as he could.  He parked it under a bridge and kept updating ""Yahoo Finance"" on his phone.  The car ran out of gas, and the bitter cold of the night took over.  He should have froze to death but no one found his body.  Just a cracked phone with 0 battery.

Sinopec Chairman Zhang Yuzhuo said the company will have 5,000 charging stations and battery swap stations by 2025.

1212,SQ," For the QQQ trades :  
1. S/He was already holding 400 QQQ shares (which was bought at a LOWER price than $336)  
2. S/He then SOLD 4 Put Option contracts at an expiry date of April 16 for a sell price of $336  
3. By virtue of SELLING Options, s/he RECEIVED money!   
4. Price of the Put option was hit - so s/he was FORCED to sell the shares at $336 - luckily, s/he ALREADY had 400 QQQ shares before selling the PUT options so the broker will just automatically sell the shares at $336 - if s/he DIDN'T have shares, the broker will BUY the shares at market price and sell immediately at $336 - in this case, looks like it doesn't matter as the share price closed pretty much at the option strike price - but imagine if the share price went down to $200 - the broker would BUY at $200 and SELL at $336!  
5. S/he collected the following tendies:  
Premium from SELLING the put options +  
Profit from selling shares at $336

For the SQ trades:  
1. Again, s/he was already holding some SQ shares  
2. Sold 15 put options at a strike price of 250  
3. Sold 300 shares of SQ at $259.35  
4. BOUGHT 30 contracts of Put options at strike price of 260 expiry date of 7-May  
5. The following tendies were made :  
Premium for selling put options +  
Profit from selling 300 shares -  
Premiums paid for 30 put options   
6. Looks like s/he is still holding on to the 30 put options as they are in the money (strike price is greater than market price) - if s/he sells now, will make more tendies - if s/he holds, will make or lose tendies depending if share price goes up or down (s/he is hoping it goes down below $260",RedGreenBoy,6,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mr2svy/i_am_gayer_than_big_gay_al/gukujh6/,0.042,0.795,0.164,0.9887

The losses shown are unrealized but as long as they don't do anything the options will either expire worthless or the options will get exercised.

They can definitely lose money if they try to close the calls ITM, but if they do nothing, they still make profit but maybe not as much profit as they could have.

Then when stamps wanted to work with other partners, USPS decided the deal was over and refused to sign up to any renewed agreements.

Stamps then went and bought MetaPack which can be seen as the market leaders in Delivery Management Platforms in the UK, but also as the belligerent incumbent that has a huge carrier integration support issue. They have something crazy like 500 carriers on their platforms (I used to be in this industry space, but not working for MetaPack) there is potentially a great deal of technical debt in the MetaPack platforms (I can't say this for sure though as I have not seen their code base, I have however heard stories from people who have worked their)

Stamps then went and bought MetaPack which can be seen as the market leaders in Delivery Management Platforms in the UK, but also as the belligerent incumbent that has a huge carrier integration support issue. They have something crazy like 500 carriers on their platforms (I used to be in this industry space, but not working for MetaPack) there is potentially a great deal of technical debt in the MetaPack platforms (I can't say this for sure though as I have not seen their code base, I have however heard stories from people who have worked their)

The loss of USPS has already been factored into the share price years ago, so the only other bit is the MetaPack deal. I am not sure if this will be enough to affect your DD though.
