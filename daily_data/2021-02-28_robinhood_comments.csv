0,ABC," So basicially, the way Margin works is it adds to your Buying Power. However, the only way you benefit is this:
For example: You buy 100 shares of ABC stock at $10. Then the price increases to $11. You gain $100. This is because when you use margin, you have to return your $1000. It’s like taking a shovel. You can’t take the shovel and only give back the handle. You have to give back all parts. So, you would give back your $1,000. But, because the stock gained to $1, you get a 10% return, which you get to keep. However, the other case is still true. 
For example: You buy 100 shares of ABC stock at $10
Then, the price decreases to $9. You have lost $1, x/Times 100 = -$100
You still owe Robinhood $100. So you pay them $1000, and now your investing account is at $1900 (Since you need a $2,000 minimum to use margin.) If you have any other questions, ask away!",FrayAcre,1,/r/RobinHood/comments/lundf5/new_goldmargin_user_understanding_the_risk/gp7kzx0/,0.022,0.871,0.107,0.9327
1,PDT," Robinhood offers by default, a margin account and a cash account. Cash accounts allow unlimited trading, but only as long as you have settled cash. A margin account allows you to trade per PDT regardless of cash settlement. The first $1000 is just for instant deposits. With Gold it actually increases to $5000. So unless you actually use margin, you dont have to repay anything.",Eli_Carni,1,/r/RobinHood/comments/lundf5/new_goldmargin_user_understanding_the_risk/gp7qtab/,0.0,0.977,0.023,0.1154
2,RH," This, and remember you can adjust your available margin to anything from $1 to the limit they have you set for, so if you do have a solid stock ***and*** enough ready funds elsewhere (i.e. a savings account or other source that you can move funds from to RH on demand) to cover the margin you're planning to use if the stock tanks anyway, then you can set it to just that amount.

Of course, if that funding source isn't otherwise benefitting you at the moment, (earning significant interest, etc.) you're better off just moving the money to RH right away and avoiding margin altogether, though in the case where the funds are certain but may just not be immediately transferable, (waiting for a deposit to clear, or a slower transfer into an account where you can then send them to RH)  then it can be a reasonable means to make a trade while you're waiting for that process.",kd5nrh,1,/r/RobinHood/comments/lundf5/new_goldmargin_user_understanding_the_risk/gp8c6rg/,0.021,0.896,0.083,0.7874
