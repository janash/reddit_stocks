13,SAFE," I'm not going to say what it should have or have not done. My point of this post is that Medmen is attracting more institutional investors. Last quarter Cresco Labs reported a 227% increase in revenue (annual) and it's stock price is still in the lower part of a range. I believe this is the case with most of the MSOs.

Bottom line is most, if not all, of the cannabis stocks are seemingly dependent upon federal legalization and the passage of a SAFE Banking Act.",Pickle_Forsaken,-5,/r/pennystocks/comments/nurmjl/hedge_fund_with_a_23_billion_portfolio_just/h0zg1mz/,0.025,0.874,0.101,0.7804
14,ID," Not pumping it. I actually really like this stock. 

I live in the Chicago area. Several weeks ago I went to the Medmen dispensary in Oak Park, IL. This happens to be their highest revenue generating store overall. I checked in with security and showed my ID. When the budtender came to assist me I was very truthful. I told him that I'm a long term investor in the company and I only came to see the store first hand for the very first time. It was like that made it all real for me and reassured me as to why I started investing in them to begin with.

IMO at current levels this stock is a steal. And I might add that when legalization hits, whenever that is, and all cannabis plays get that pop, this stock could potentially give any investor a 10x plus return on their money. At a little under .30 that would be share price hitting $3.00.

21,HP," The next foreseeable step for this company is Q4 earnings in July which should knock it out of the park. I expect their profit margins (which aren't great) to improve in these results considering their increased business, new CFO, and no merger costs that bogged down their previous quarterly (and when I say bogged down, they still made $91M). Lets be pessimistic and say Q4 doesn't have much change from Q3 and the price doesn't move much off of that, that's o.k. because Q1 in September is going to be amazing. Their contracts with Autozone and HP start Q1 (aka June 1st 2021) and also their new CFO will have had control over all aspects of Q1 which I am sure he was brought in there to increase profit margin (as well as other things)

Those are just earnings...

As far as other catalyst, nothing is definite but they do have other branches they can merge with in Hong Kong, China, and Taiwan.

Before they hired their new CFO they filed to move to the OTCQB which is still on the table.

Also the HP signing and Autozone signing were pleasant surprises so their is always the possibility of more signings. The CEO does say in almost every news release they are looking to expand more, plus this new credit facility also helps to do that.",peterpeterny,2,/r/pennystocks/comments/nutfnf/unql_shipping_company_with_over_a_quarter_of_a/h11iyq7/,0.027,0.853,0.121,0.9674

Why would you hold a stock on a company that is probably 5 years away of making any revenue?  Add in the high cost of trials+ low amount of current cash (per you), and a stewardship that is not great this story will end up at best with dilution and at worst never hearing from them again.

167,HOFV," Depends on your goal with the stock, I have some that I trim 20% after it's 5 bagged, some I trim half at 100%, some I unload all of them at 40% gains, and some I just sit on in hopes it will let me retire early. My long term plays I usually trim much less and sometimes it has hurt, but others it has allowed me to load more after future dips, $AABB for example I was in at .0035, I trimmed 100k to recoup my original investment + some profit at .02.  It wound up running up to the .60 range so the trim hurt a lot. Medium-long term plays or stocks I think may breakout more than they have already big I may only trim 50% HOFV for example I cut half my position once it hit 6.50 with my original buy in being around 1.55.  Stocks that I think are PnDs I typically only aim for 20-40% profit depending on whether or not I beat the crowd into them.
