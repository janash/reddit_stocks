Its fine that he only compared quarter to quarter, that's apples to apples. They do make over 2B in revenue... but at less \~1% margin lol! GME margins (when they were profitable pre 2018 were around 7%). So you really shouldn't compare to GME. A retailer should be valued on Net Income and FCFF since for many more than 90% of their revenue is paid for in COGS.

101,AMC," This actually wont work right now for NEGG because it popped more than any other stock I've seen get pumped by WSB. As of this morning the options chain hasn't been built out past $40 and the borrow cost on shorting the stock is at ludicrous levels of >80% annual interest rate. 

But in general you would:   
Step 1) Short the stock when you think its near the peak. Obviously this is hard to time but if you're in the 2-3x the actual value of the company chances are its been pumped. Also since you're using a collar you can ride things out if it keeps mooning. 

Step 2) Immediately sell a put options around the price you think it will drop to for exactly the same number of shares you shorted divided by 100 for the options contract size. But give yourself some decent buffer on the strike price because some of these overpriced stocks take a while to drop back to reasonable valuations. For this stock it popped from $10 to $70 in a two weeks, maybe assume that it drops halfway back to around $35 and sell you put here. You'll want to also time the expiration on the put to be 2-3 months out to give time for the stock to mean revert... reddit is notoriously myopic in their investing timeline and 2-3 months seems to do the trick.

Step 3) buy an OTM call for exactly the same premium as the put you sold at the same expiration. The proceeds from the put cover the cost of your call and you're hedged for zero cost.  

If the strategy works and the stock trades down below the put your sold the put will expire in the money and close out your short position, and the call will expire worthless. 

WARNING! This strategy does have risks. The main one being that not every stock that moons returns to its intrinsic value, AMC and GME have been trading in la la land for months now. But for the vast majority of stocks that WSB pumps have retracted to roughly their target valuations. Also don't size the position greater than the maximum loss your account can handle. Know your excess liquidity on your margin account and size the OTM call so that if the stock does continue to trade up you can safely ride out the storm without being forced to cover. If you get burned the maximum loss you'll sustain is the difference between the strike price of the calls you purchased and the price you shorted at times the number of shares you shorted.",lifeaquatic34,10,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ofsb8t/neggs_cheap_paper_dont_get_fucking_played/h4gj7wq/,0.064,0.869,0.067,0.3319

137,SOL," I work directly in the foreclosure area for one of the biggest banks in the US.  The foreclosure dam is getting ready to burst at the seams again.  Not quite like the crisis but not far from it either.  The emphasis has been to get all these people on loan assistance (forbearance/loan mods) etc., to hold back the flood gates.  So far it's simply putting a bandaid on a bullet hole.  With the US CFPB directions we'll be doing that until the end of the year.  But the jobs that most of these people lost aren't coming back or back in the same capacity as before.  Many are in a continual loop of modifying or forbearance and defaulting on new terms every few months if not every month.  There's only so many times we can change the terms.  CFPB is trying to make it nearly impossible to deny loan mods basically minimal documentation, take their word for it now.  But they keep defaulting regardless.  I have many friends and family that have been trying to buy a house and are being outbid left and right.  People are taking advantage of low rates, which is good but they're overpaying on property that isn't nearly worth what they're financing for.  Driving up market price everywhere and property taxes and causing a bubble to form as these properties values will flip come next year.  All the information we receive from the government is that come Jan 1, 2022 all these borrowers are SOL and no further assistance will be provided.  We've a few hundred thousand loans in default that are marinating in the forbearance/loan mod stew.  I'm pretty sure every bank in the country has a sizable amount of loans that are in the forbearance/loan mod purgatory, waiting to move to foreclosure.  Come Jan 1, there will be some major changes to the housing market if enough people default on their new terms which they already are.  If you're looking to buy a house wait until end of first quarter beginning of second next year.  If the government doesn't take action which is what we've been told they won't do then there'll be an overabundance of foreclosures on the market again and prices should fall.",Wish_36,128,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/og6ofy/housing_a_big_bubbly_pile_of_garbage_that_will/h4h0af3/,0.068,0.874,0.059,0.0915

147,IT," Just to add to your point, if you look back to 2006-2007 
The foreclosure rate in the US was at an all time high, causing the bubble to burst in 2008. When banks lend money and the borrower can't pay, banks are forced to sell the property to try and recover their loss. When banks are hit with such a high rate of foreclosures in such a short periodof time, some if not most investment institutions will require some sort of bailout from the gov. If the government doesn't help then most will be forced to shut down, look at what happened in 2008.

How dose this apply to today?

Let's look back to 2019, covid hit and everything shut down.
Do to No work and no income, government knew people couldn't pay bills, mortgages or rent. So they declared that people could not get their services disconnected, kicked out of their rentals or be foreclosed on by banks. THEY NEVER SAID WE DONT HAVE TO PAY IT BACK LATER, ONCE THE ECONOMY REOPENED.

So let's start with the homeowners:
A lot of home owners haven't paid their mortgages in over a year.. sure some got forbearance from the banks but how many of them were unfamiliar with the process and just stopped paying. 
How many of them do you think thought the government ment they wouldn't have to pay it back at a later date.

Once the government opens up everything and people start getting foreclosure letters from the bank. They have 2 options, 1. Payback what they owe to date or 2. Sell the house as fast as possible. 

Being that most don't have money laying around most will go with option 2. The owners that just woke up, will take advantage of the current high market and try an sell at outrageous prices to try and make some money.
BUT once everyone else starts getting the letters from the bank they too will rush to sell and the market will get folded,
Driving the prices down. 

Well at that point, won't investors just buy up everything?

Not really, as you well know investors buy property to either RENT or FLIP. A lot of investors who didn't flip property, have their money locked into properties they owned pre-COVID. So, being that a lot of tennents have NOT been paying RENT throughout the pandemic, most of them will be busy spending money in lawsuits trying to evict the current tennents. 

As for the investors that buy an flip,, the market will be so oversaturated with homes, unless they have a ton of money to buy and hold until the ECONOMY picks up I highly doubt they will buy right away. 

In my opinion after the banks take such a big hit in this inevitable POP, the banks that are left willing to lend will have raised their requirements to get a mortgage. So sit back, build your credit and save up as much as possible. So yr ready to buy when shit hits the fan.",Zebone420,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/og6ofy/housing_a_big_bubbly_pile_of_garbage_that_will/h4i66b4/,0.065,0.88,0.055,-0.4409
148,CO," I agree on the evictions moratorium impacting housing prices but your numbers are likely not as accurate as they think you are. You are counting increasing population but are not compensating for the fact that not every *one person* will own a home. 

For example, Colorado grew by 80,000 residents in 2018 and an additional 60,000 residents in 2019. In December of 2020 there were 3,000 single family homes on the market and about 2,000 condos available for sale. Assume three people per household and the desire to buy instead of rent. The demand would be around 80,000 units. 

Obviously that is rough, because people will rent, some households will have more than three members, and some will have only one. The point is, you don't have to look too hard to see why housing prices in CO are booming, even with homebuilders starting to build at a faster rate. It is hard to outbuild demand, unless we all get OK with modular housing (and really, we should be) this trend will continue. Europe has a similar problem and their solution was simple - most people simply rent. Europe has strong renter protections, and they don't have the fantasy of owning a home.",Leucippus1,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/og6ofy/housing_a_big_bubbly_pile_of_garbage_that_will/h4i02yp/,0.048,0.874,0.078,0.8537

So in a lot of places you have equilibrium. House goes on market and is sold immediately. Prices are keeping a lot of buyers out of the market so until there is wage growth or debt reduction things will stay hot. For debt reduction if biden reduces or eliminates student loans that would drive the housing market bigly. suddenly you'd have a lot of people with more money in their pocket each month and now able to buy.",jwight,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/og6ofy/housing_a_big_bubbly_pile_of_garbage_that_will/h4hycag/,0.096,0.86,0.044,-0.7783

161,RE," Yeah, I think you need to look to household growth. Not raw population. And look to inventory of housing for sale (days on market, etc.). And realize that real estate is highly regional. Fifty acres in bumfuck WV sells for a fraction of what 2,000 sf or land in Boston sells for.

162,DD," So many statements of opinion in this original DD masquerading as fact but i will just reply to one in your response.

&#x200B;

""Once the moratorium on foreclosures is lifted, the market will be flooded with houses. ""

&#x200B;

Foreclosure process takes years and depends strongly on the amount of fight in the borrower, if they retain legal representation, etc.  After the boom/then crash of the 2000s, the title companies, already well behind from the boom, couldn't keep up with all the foreclosure work.  This slowed down the foreclosures by literally years, just the title companies alone.    


Foreclosures are often sold at auction, then flipped, which also keeps them from ""drastically dropping market prices"" because only people with cash, willing to buy a house without a walkthrough at an auction, can buy most foreclosures.

It's a lot more complicated than the simple one sentence reduction, and i wouldn't depend on highly regional figures to say that foreclosures will drastically drop prices.

Source: I have been an underwriter since 2004 and also worked in the foreclosure department for a large bank.  I have a ton of coworkers i know as well and we talk about all of this.

164,BR," The $120-130B in Fed monthly bond purchasing....what debt do you think they are buying?   At least $40B last time I looked in May every month going into MBS buying.  Reports of Blackrock paying 50% above asking price might just be because their MBS offerings are bought down by the Fed.

Not saying that's all of it, but the thumb is on the scale for lower rates.   

The other side, everyone is anxious about the economy, we all know it's fucked, we all hope it can make a comeback before the fed/treasury stims run out, but honestly it's an artificial market.   People aren't moving over their paranoia, inventory only in the last month coming up (and not that much).

I'm not sure it's a bubble like 2008, but yes there's some fuckery going on as OP said.   I haven't seen/heard of people doing massive cash-out-refinancing, or sub-prime lending.  In 08 I had friends with 5-10 houses with 0 down and clauses that they could just ""drop the keys off"" with the lender no-fault defaults.   They left banks holding the bag on dozens of properties, they weren't insolvent had renters, but so far underwater that it wasn't worth the effort.  Idiot lenders caused that.

Now...I see MBS owners might be holding a heavy bag as values come off the highs, but I don't see private equity BR getting bailed out (or needing it, when your Fed fueled MBS rate is 1.2% what worry?).",555-Rally,15,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/og6ofy/housing_a_big_bubbly_pile_of_garbage_that_will/h4i7y4k/,0.103,0.814,0.083,-0.4943
165,GDP," >Canada has an extreme supply shortage of housing in these major markets
 
Loooooooooooooool 

https://financialpost.com/opinion/george-fallis-its-a-housing-bubble-in-toronto-not-a-supply-squeeze

>Using estimates of their responsiveness from the economics literature, the market fundamentals analysis predicts house prices should probably have risen about 12 per cent in Toronto since 2014. In fact, they rose 93 per cent. The 81 per cent that market fundamentals can‚Äôt explain is likely bubble.

>This analysis simply assumed a supply response. But what actually happened on the supply side in the Toronto housing market? A total of 230,210 ‚Äúdwelling units‚Äù were completed over the six years. Population had increased by 556,470; assuming household size remained at 2.8 persons, the population increase required 198,740 new units. The supply of new units was more than enough to accommodate the growing population. Moreover, the housing stock was further augmented by renovation and by tearing down old houses to be replaced by larger new houses, both of which have been booming in Toronto. Residential real estate investment, which includes both new construction and renovation, has been a rising share of GDP. There is thus no problem on the supply side of the Toronto market. Of course, more supply will reduce prices slightly, but the Toronto price escalation is not caused by supply problems.",frndlthngnlsvgs,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/og6ofy/housing_a_big_bubbly_pile_of_garbage_that_will/h4i4ryq/,0.053,0.899,0.048,-0.2382
166,OG," >What are the odds this happening in the US will drive down housing prices in Canada?

Fairly low. Just look back at 08. Canadian Housing prices (at least in the major markets) did not move down much, compared to the large drops that occurred with all other asset classes. The main difference being we did not have a run on defaults. Housing in general is considered ""Sticky"" in that, if your house does go down in value, you just sit on it, and do not sell. Not selling decreases supply on the market, so you don't see large decreases. Housing is basically the OG diamond hands market. 

The only time you see a large decrease is if a ton of people are forced to sell via default, which is fairly unlikely. Firstly in Canada you need 20% for the down payment (go back to the 08 crash and homes where being 95 to 100% financed in the US), there are stress tests in place for interest rates, plus a government that is more likely to jump in head first if something really bad was happening. (Our downside from the US is our debt costs a bit more, and we can't get the 20 to 25 year locked in rates like they can)

Now would this make a house a good investment? Maybe, maybe not, you might see the prices of houses go flat for a long period, given the massive run up we have seen, and/or the potential for markets (stock) in general to have a cooling or crash. But you need to also look at the cost of your rent, vs the cost of owning, what you will likely find is you are still better off owning.",Adamwlu,4,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/og6ofy/housing_a_big_bubbly_pile_of_garbage_that_will/h4hu0ip/,0.052,0.898,0.05,0.3101

169,IMO," I dont agree with that at all in that mortgages are not that hard to get in Canada right now and many are buying houses in Toronto but will never have nowhere near the amount of money to actually own it. If the market goes belly up and the interest rates rise a lot of these people will get defaulted on since they can barely get by as it is in a city like this.

Add to that, demand is around 1.2M homes a year to just keep up and not increase the current (huge) deficit in homes, and you have a recipe for a severe supply-demand imbalance.

Then, you add treasury yields (a proxy for mortgage rates), and a mortgage origination war where the largest players are undercutting their competition on rates....

Add elevated prices for commodities needed for home building, and home repairs. Namely, lumber, copper, and aluminum, steel, as well as (presumably) cement, and you've got sky high new home purchases (combined with higher, and still rising margins. 

Then you top that off with much lower forbearance rates, which will continue to fall.

Then you add to the fact that there have been companies that have been buying homes from people, and letting them attempt to repurchase it in a year or two if they can, while they rent it back to them...

I suppose if you take that and re-invest you could make more, but to me paying down loans for your own housing is a priority.  Then play money on rentals, but that play evidently isn't how people want to roll.   Lots of reasons for that too, either people are desperate, or they are wanting to buy a new car (and pay for it for 30yrs, that sounds fun).

707,AMZN," One more quick gotcha for the big dick crew. How to capture profit without performing a day trade? Sell a strike above/below and make collateral free vertical spread.

For example, after nuking a yolo port, I had to play with the remains without day trading. Bought SPY calls this morning and wanted to capture the profit. 

Bought 20x SPY 7/9 427c @ 2.91 ea. Of course, SPY is recovering quite well so far, enough for me to sell 20x of the 428c for 3.16ea. 

This puts my principle + 400 bucks back in my pocket. Heres a link to what it looks like with the P/L chart in the bottom right.

It sounds like this service was basically the lender of last resort to people who were already leveraged to the tits on instant loans from all over the place and lagging behind on multiple CC bills, and the minimum payment was probably close to the monthly interest on this thing. Somebody obviously took a look at the WFC balance sheet and did the math what would happen with these loans if interest rates were ever to rise even slightly. Obviously, that same something is inevitably going to happen with many of these loans now that they will have to be amortized at a faster rate than the minimum payment has been. Yes, there were probably normal consumer loans for reasonable purposes in the mix, but if the service has been marketed like the news say, there's going to be so many toxic assets.

798,AC," A slightly better analogy for puts is to think of a merchants who ssell portable air conditioners. A heat wave has hit the northwest and people are paying 2x MSRP for air conditioners. $150 ACs are going for $300.

A trader sees that ACs are going for $300 and tells a local merchant he'll sell them some next week for $200 each, if they're going for less than 200. The merchant says that's stupid, if they're going for less I'll buy them for less. So the trader says, ah, but I'll pay you $100 now and you can keep it. If they're going for more than 200, nothing happens, but you still keep the money. If they're going for less, you'll have to buy them from me for 200 each. I'll pay you for the option to sell to you for $200. And if I exercise that option, you'll have to buy them for $200.

The merchant thinks that ACs will only go up in price as it's June and just the start of summer, and takes the bet.

If a week later the heatwave is over and new shipments if ACs have refilled shelves at all the big box stores. They're going now for their original MSRP of 150. But the merchant is obligated to buy them from the trader for 200 each. The trader can exercise the option, buy a bunch for 150 and sell them to the merchant for 200, or he can sell this contract to some other trader or AC supplier, or even back to the original merchant.

However, if a week later the price of ACs is 500 as a second heat wave hit the town and Covid delta variant caused shortages in the supply chain for ACs, then the merchant doesn't get to buy them for 200. The option owner has the option to sell or not, that's what he paid $100 for. And clearly he'll choose to not sell $500 ACs for $200. But, the merchant gets to keep the $100 he made.

In summary, the put seller wins the premium if the price doesn't go down, and the put buyer wins the difference between the strike price and the current price, minus the premium, if the price goes down. Or more simply the put buyer is betting the price will come down and the put seller is betting it won't.",Ok-Reporter-4600,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/og7n4r/td_ameritrade_aint_the_easiest_to_show_gains_but/h4hsyq4/,0.022,0.926,0.052,0.946

VLO is a beast and probably one of the best managed energy companies.

With all this green talk at the white house, Valero is going to benefit bigly from it's renewable diesel segment.

Last I read their investors report they were on track to expand their renewable diesel refining.

And many states/provinces etc are mandating a certain % ""renewable"" mix for fuels. 

biodisel (ethanol) blended fuel is trash and soon enough the corn subsidies will be reduces albeit very slowly.

While renewable diesel literally turns trash (animal fats, cooking oils etc) and turns it into diesel.

They only need to upkeep the refining infrastructure. Theres no wells to drill, no offshore platforms to lease, none of that shit.
