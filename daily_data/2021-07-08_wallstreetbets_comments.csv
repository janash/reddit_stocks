Seizures like this make how villainous they are clearly apparent, desperate to keep their people oppressed they have to keep the Western world in check by having the looming threat of dumping our currency to crash the dollars value. 

We need to counter their culture war of boycotts and hatred of American company's and ideals with one of our own. We are placating Hitler in a new age but we have let him blossom far further than the democratic world did before. Xi Jinping has completed his own genocide, utilized their success of the Corona virus to enforce the ideals of a nationalist homogenous superior ""society"" (you know what word fits better there) and now stands as a threat to legitimacy of respectful international commerce. 

Please my fellow Americans rise every day with a purpose; we have lost our faith in our own dreams and thereby fallen to personal, emotional and national ruin.

49,USA," So China fucked Americans out of 13 billion? Talk to me for a moment not like I'm some mediocre low-wealth noob trader on WSB, but like I'm someone who might have some small minor influence on USA national security policy outside of this subreddit. China fucked Americans out of 13 billion by attracting American investment to a company and then shutting it down, that's the gist of it? Props to OP for using ""wumao"" in a sentence.

Yes, I would be entirely in favor of de-listing Chinese stocks or holding them to higher regulatory standards to prevent Americans from getting fucked. I would NOT respond in kind (i.e., set a trap for Chinese investors like they apparently did for us). The loss of access to American stock markets is a significant enough penalty.

For what it's worth, I have been to China, and I would rather USA make China a partner than an adversary. I want robust mutually-profitable trade between our countries instead of a trade war - I want American farmers to have the opportunity to profit from selling their soybeans to China if they so desire. Have you seen the agricultural fields of Iowa? Corn and soy beans, corn and soy beans as far as the eye can see. But I also saw dictator Xi Jinping's CCP anniversary speech on C-SPAN - I saw the petrified unnatural stillness of the crowd, the fear in their faces, their robot-like applause, and it horrified me. I have no illusions about the CCP.

So yeah, China fucked my people, the American People? Then let's start de-listing their stocks from our exchanges and see if that doesn't encourage them to treat American investors with more respect and integrity.",FallujahVet,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ofo6u0/didi_took_13_billion_in_cash_from_american/h4gmquy/,0.201,0.636,0.163,-0.9614

Its fine that he only compared quarter to quarter, that's apples to apples. They do make over 2B in revenue... but at less \~1% margin lol! GME margins (when they were profitable pre 2018 were around 7%). So you really shouldn't compare to GME. A retailer should be valued on Net Income and FCFF since for many more than 90% of their revenue is paid for in COGS.

EDIT: further down this thread I've written out more detailed instructions.

153,AMC," This actually wont work right now for NEGG because it popped more than any other stock I've seen get pumped by WSB. As of this morning the options chain hasn't been built out past $40 and the borrow cost on shorting the stock is at ludicrous levels of >80% annual interest rate. 

But in general you would:   
Step 1) Short the stock when you think its near the peak. Obviously this is hard to time but if you're in the 2-3x the actual value of the company chances are its been pumped. Also since you're using a collar you can ride things out if it keeps mooning. 

Step 2) Immediately sell a put options around the price you think it will drop to for exactly the same number of shares you shorted divided by 100 for the options contract size. But give yourself some decent buffer on the strike price because some of these overpriced stocks take a while to drop back to reasonable valuations. For this stock it popped from $10 to $70 in a two weeks, maybe assume that it drops halfway back to around $35 and sell you put here. You'll want to also time the expiration on the put to be 2-3 months out to give time for the stock to mean revert... reddit is notoriously myopic in their investing timeline and 2-3 months seems to do the trick.

Step 3) buy an OTM call for exactly the same premium as the put you sold at the same expiration. The proceeds from the put cover the cost of your call and you're hedged for zero cost.  

If the strategy works and the stock trades down below the put your sold the put will expire in the money and close out your short position, and the call will expire worthless. 

WARNING! This strategy does have risks. The main one being that not every stock that moons returns to its intrinsic value, AMC and GME have been trading in la la land for months now. But for the vast majority of stocks that WSB pumps have retracted to roughly their target valuations. Also don't size the position greater than the maximum loss your account can handle. Know your excess liquidity on your margin account and size the OTM call so that if the stock does continue to trade up you can safely ride out the storm without being forced to cover.

* The market for current gen CPU, GPU, and consoles is crazy right now, mostly due to scalpers, every unit becoming available at retail stores gets sold out in minutes (if not seconds).
* NewEgg is the only one smart enough to start NewEgg Shuffle programme, where they are selling most of those hard to get items bundled with other items. So I am guessing their ER would blow expectations out of the park.
* Nasdaq site was earlier reporting that ER was expected on June 30th. That could have generated some interest. This was the reason I bought immediately instead of waiting. Of course the ER didn't happen.
* On June 30th, option chain became available for the first time.
* It's possible that given these chain of events, people jumped on the options, causing a gamma squeeze.
* This could have lead to a snowball effect, causing the price to go up, higher Strike priced options becoming available and pressure has continued to build up in the days since.

I did factor in the fact that the current gen CPU, GPU, and console market is insane right now, every single unit is getting sold within minutes. They were the only one smart enough to capatalise on it by introducing NewEgg Shuffle, where they are selling most of those units in bundles, thus benefiting from the situation and increasing their sales numbers.

184,WMT," I don't have a solid reasoning behind it. I couldn't compare it with giants like AMZN, WMT etc. because those companies are into multiple things.

I did factor in the fact that the current gen CPU, GPU, and console market is insane right now, every single unit is getting sold within minutes. They were the only one smart enough to capatalise on it by introducing NewEgg Shuffle, where they are selling most of those units in bundles, thus benefiting from the situation and increasing their sales numbers.

If you‚Äôre knowledge of options is limited sell the $210call expiring this Friday to recoup some losses on theta decay.

If you have some idea of what you‚Äôre doing sell at the $205 for more extrinsic also you can roll if things go tits up. $200 is probably too low to roll it for a credit.

If the first call sold expired was OTM by the time you bought to close. sell the $220 call expiring on the 16th to turn your long calls into a debit spread. you‚Äôll recoup come losses if the stock is still beneath $210 on the 16th(unfortunately it probably will be) and you‚Äôll be at nearly breakeven if it reaches $210. You‚Äôll be at about 400+ credit received from selling calls if it goes above $220.

465,IMO," I have extensive knowledge of the small drone industry and IMO WKHS‚Äôs drones and drone business model is garbage. Why? FAA rules. 

Bezos said Prime Air delivering to your backyard within 5 years‚Ä¶.. 7 years ago now. If Amazon can‚Äôt lobby or finanangle their way into making it happen for their own delivery fleet after having spent years and tons of money on it, no way in fuck is some poorly funded and executed company going to eat their lunch. 
And, there are are drone vendors that are light years ahead in terms of tech and flight control software to actually make it work.

My forecast for Workhorse revenue from drones in the next 5 years is less than two frosties and a small fry at Wendy‚Äôs.

Next, the fucking trucks that DID NOT GET SELECTED for the massive USPS contract. Granted there are plenty of places in the US where electric delivery straight up doesn‚Äôt make sense due to limited range, but still. That was a major kick in the dick that my calls and account balance are still recovering from.

AND WKHS is all but one commercial truck/van entry away from death if a real vehicle manufacturer like Ford/Mercedes or fuck it even Tesla get in the game. An electric Transit or Sprinter van, especially as a cab chassis would pretty much put WKHS out to pasture.

Long story short, after having initially drank the kool aid on this one over the last year, I‚Äôve reevaluated my opinion, which is is now: fuck WKHS. And Lordstown Motors for that matter.

Bezos said Prime Air delivering to your backyard within 5 years‚Ä¶.. 7 years ago now. If Amazon can‚Äôt lobby or finanangle their way into making it happen for their own delivery fleet after having spent years and tons of money on it, no way in fuck is some poorly funded and executed company going to eat their lunch. 
And, there are are drone vendors that are light years ahead in terms of tech and flight control software to actually make it work.

My forecast for Workhorse revenue from drones in the next 5 years is less than two frosties and a small fry at Wendy‚Äôs.

Next, the fucking trucks that DID NOT GET SELECTED for the massive USPS contract. Granted there are plenty of places in the US where electric delivery straight up doesn‚Äôt make sense due to limited range, but still. That was a major kick in the dick that my calls and account balance are still recovering from.

AND WKHS is all but one commercial truck/van entry away from death if a real vehicle manufacturer like Ford/Mercedes or fuck it even Tesla get in the game. An electric Transit or Sprinter van, especially as a cab chassis would pretty much put WKHS out to pasture.

Long story short, after having initially drank the kool aid on this one over the last year, I‚Äôve reevaluated my opinion, which is is now: fuck WKHS. And Lordstown Motors for that matter.

596,BOOM," Remember when Arcades were everywhere and people packed them out. 
That was because they were the primary source for video games. Then technology improved and people were able to play games at the house. So a decline began. And then the quality of home-gaming drastically improved. So arcades died out and became a thing of the past. 

THAT‚ÄôS movie theaters rn. Literally. We no longer need to go to theaters to watch movies. Technology has improved to the point where we can stream them from home. Then technology drastically improved over that. All of this happened over the last decade. We‚Äôre one last bump away from finishing off theater chains. People saying ‚Äúwhat about the jobs‚Äù are crazy. What about em? Things come and things go. They can always apply for a different job somewhere else. They even have the benefit of learning a lesson about picking a risky, unstable career. Contrary to popular belief, there are plenty of jobs available. Mom and Pop (small business) needs all the help it can get right now. Seriously. You know what would turn them to profit? A surplus of dedicated employees. After that the writing is on the wall for an increase in revenue. Because productivity is a killer or healer for small business. And guess what? The more ppl work there, the more word of mouth, the more support. BOOM.

887,SOL," I work directly in the foreclosure area for one of the biggest banks in the US.  The foreclosure dam is getting ready to burst at the seams again.  Not quite like the crisis but not far from it either.  The emphasis has been to get all these people on loan assistance (forbearance/loan mods) etc., to hold back the flood gates.  So far it's simply putting a bandaid on a bullet hole.  With the US CFPB directions we'll be doing that until the end of the year.  But the jobs that most of these people lost aren't coming back or back in the same capacity as before.  Many are in a continual loop of modifying or forbearance and defaulting on new terms every few months if not every month.  There's only so many times we can change the terms.  CFPB is trying to make it nearly impossible to deny loan mods basically minimal documentation, take their word for it now.  But they keep defaulting regardless.  I have many friends and family that have been trying to buy a house and are being outbid left and right.  People are taking advantage of low rates, which is good but they're overpaying on property that isn't nearly worth what they're financing for.  Driving up market price everywhere and property taxes and causing a bubble to form as these properties values will flip come next year.  All the information we receive from the government is that come Jan 1, 2022 all these borrowers are SOL and no further assistance will be provided.  We've a few hundred thousand loans in default that are marinating in the forbearance/loan mod stew.  I'm pretty sure every bank in the country has a sizable amount of loans that are in the forbearance/loan mod purgatory, waiting to move to foreclosure.  Come Jan 1, there will be some major changes to the housing market if enough people default on their new terms which they already are.  If you're looking to buy a house wait until end of first quarter beginning of second next year.  If the government doesn't take action which is what we've been told they won't do then there'll be an overabundance of foreclosures on the market again and prices should fall.",Wish_36,53,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/og6ofy/housing_a_big_bubbly_pile_of_garbage_that_will/h4h0af3/,0.068,0.874,0.059,0.0915

I will easily sell off if the market starts a crash like 2008. The bottom was a great time to buy. SCCO was at $9. It's over $60 now. Sirius was around 9 cents. $6.50 now.

891,RE," Yeah, I think you need to look to household growth. Not raw population. And look to inventory of housing for sale (days on market, etc.). And realize that real estate is highly regional. Fifty acres in bumfuck WV sells for a fraction of what 2,000 sf or land in Boston sells for. 

The housing crash in 07/08 did not bring down all ships. It did wash out and destroy shitty homes in shitty speculative towns. 

When it comes to real estate ‚Äúlocation, location, location‚Äù. 

So if you are in an area where nobody wanted to live 20 years ago, but is now hot since ‚Äúprices are so much cheaper than San Fran!!‚Äù, watch out. 

And if you are in an area that has weathered every RE boom/bust storm of the past century, and aren‚Äôt over leveraged, you are probably fine.

The advantage of living in a HCOL area is that most folks around there have tons of money, very safe jobs, and don‚Äôt fall very far in any recession.

893,ATH," I think people have been missing the point, which is that this is a byproduct of home builders who've been scarred after 2008. It has led to an almost 4M undersupply of homes, that will take -years- to reduce. 

Add to that, demand is around 1.2M homes a year to just keep up and not increase the current (huge) deficit in homes, and you have a recipe for a severe supply-demand imbalance.

Then, you add treasury yields (a proxy for mortgage rates), and a mortgage origination war where the largest players are undercutting their competition on rates....

Add elevated prices for commodities needed for home building, and home repairs. Namely, lumber, copper, and aluminum, steel, as well as (presumably) cement, and you've got sky high new home purchases (combined with higher, and still rising margins. 

Then you top that off with much lower forbearance rates, which will continue to fall.

Then you add to the fact that there have been companies that have been buying homes from people, and letting them attempt to repurchase it in a year or two if they can, while they rent it back to them...

And I don't think the end will do much to alleviate the problem, though it will -help-. 

Lumber prices, and copper prices have been dropping (lumber much prodigiously, which is good since it's the single highest expense in a home). Aluminum, and Steel are still matching their ATH however, and i don't see that easing up anytime soon (which is bearish for car manufacturers and RIDE specifically).

Add to that, demand is around 1.2M homes a year to just keep up and not increase the current (huge) deficit in homes, and you have a recipe for a severe supply-demand imbalance.

Then, you add treasury yields (a proxy for mortgage rates), and a mortgage origination war where the largest players are undercutting their competition on rates....

Add elevated prices for commodities needed for home building, and home repairs. Namely, lumber, copper, and aluminum, steel, as well as (presumably) cement, and you've got sky high new home purchases (combined with higher, and still rising margins. 

Then you top that off with much lower forbearance rates, which will continue to fall.

Then you add to the fact that there have been companies that have been buying homes from people, and letting them attempt to repurchase it in a year or two if they can, while they rent it back to them...

And I don't think the end will do much to alleviate the problem, though it will -help-. 

Lumber prices, and copper prices have been dropping (lumber much prodigiously, which is good since it's the single highest expense in a home). Aluminum, and Steel are still matching their ATH however, and i don't see that easing up anytime soon (which is bearish for car manufacturers and RIDE specifically).

955,GME," I understand connection with gamma, but how does option volume connect to short squeezes. Also options were added to $NEGG last week -- so most price increases were not driven by options (maybe that changed a bit today).  I'm looking at the OI and a lot of volume on the 40c -- 16k volume on a contract with no OI -- makes me think the 40c contract only made available today. Given that it opened at $27 this volume seems reasonable. When I entered i think 35c was the highest option I could get (maybe 40) but it definitely wasn't 80.
maybe the disconnect is that the option chain keeps getting added to everyday, and this was not a pump by retail.

956,OI," I understand connection with gamma, but how does option volume connect to short squeezes. Also options were added to $NEGG last week -- so most price increases were not driven by options (maybe that changed a bit today).  I'm looking at the OI and a lot of volume on the 40c -- 16k volume on a contract with no OI -- makes me think the 40c contract only made available today. Given that it opened at $27 this volume seems reasonable. When I entered i think 35c was the highest option I could get (maybe 40) but it definitely wasn't 80.
maybe the disconnect is that the option chain keeps getting added to everyday, and this was not a pump by retail.

Not only have they not left the launchpad, they haven't even arrived at the launchpad, while their competition has self landing rockets on land and water and the other competitors are leaving them in the dust.

And yet all Boeing needs to do is play the Patriotism card and they're fine, how else did they get the tanker order and space program approvals when their product offerings were inferior at best. They raised billions of capital in a heartbeat. 

Many people in Seattle and Chicago should be in jail for the MAX along with people in DC from the FAA. So buy Boeing because logic doesn't apply to them and ya know Patriotism card and it'll go up.
