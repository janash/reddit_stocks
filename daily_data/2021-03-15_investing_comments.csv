0,HR," I live in Michigan. Most of my friends and family work for one of the big 3 auto companies. I know people working in all departments at Ford, from HR to EV's. I want Ford to succeed massively because it would improve the lives of everyone in my life. All that said, none of us believe Ford will be the forefront of anything, especially EV's. Ford is in the business of keeping the status quo; Ford is not an innovator. My engineer friends working on Ford's EV's are not excited about it. If the engineers can't get excited about what they do, I can't get excited about it for myself. There are many other better options if you want to invest in the future of EV.

1,SYNC," I’ve owned Ford stock since about 2010 or so. It was a sentimental purchase at the time from a relatively young person who grew up in a family that owned a lot of Fords. I’ve kept it since, and through the dividends and reinvestment I’ve slowly eked up to 200 shares.

I think Ford is in the middle of executing a great strategy. I personally love the Mach-E and have an order placed. It bodes well for their ability to competently transition to an EV portfolio. In the next 6-12 months I think Ford also needs to instill confidence in their ability to push out OTA updates like Tesla has done. My only concern is how they manage the transition from SYNC 4A to this new Google/Android partnership - Ford could lose a lot of goodwill and momentum if it’s just an abrupt break in terms of compatibility in the pre-2023 MYs.

I’ve seen some criticism about Ford’s dividend, rather than funding further investments in the business, so it will be interesting to see how soon the dividend is reinstated. Would the dividend be more effective if leveraged to bring down debt, or applied to the expenses required to ramp up as an EV manufacturer?",MrMeiko,29,/r/investing/comments/m5kkxa/ford_f_ugly_duckling_to_golden_goose/gr0hkjd/,0.037,0.82,0.143,0.9704

6,ID," A few points I'm surprised you didn't touch upon.

First off, I'll agree that Ford seems to have improved vastly in the past decade or so, but I'm surprised you made no mention of their recent problem with F-150 owners complaining about underbody rust after only a few hundred miles, or their recall on the Mach-e for loose bolts.

That being said, Ford has done a good job of integrating the Mach-e into the Electrify America network. The process of charging the car is about as simple as Tesla's: open the port and plug in. Whereas VW, arguably their largest competitor with the ID.4 (besides the Model Y), hasn't integrated into *their own network* at all. I think the ease of that process is going to resonate well with customers, and be a big selling point over the ID.4 (not to mention the performance).",1LX50,2,/r/investing/comments/m5kkxa/ford_f_ugly_duckling_to_golden_goose/gr0zv2k/,0.088,0.802,0.11,0.3291

16,CTO," I followed and owned ford stock for years.  Great technical run down on the stock but you are missing something big: their product.  This is why I got out.  Even Ford's profitable models are way behind when you look at the competition.  Jim Farley is running the classic For playbook that hasn't worked for the last 15 years: realize they are behind, spend a ton of money, outsource most of the technology rather than build technology as a core competency, and deliver too slow and too poorly to keep up with the competition.  This is the company that contracted Microsoft for the first version of their modern electronics.  Anyone in tech could have told you that was a bad idea.  In 2011 when iPhones were already rampant, dashboards included a physical phone keypad, so you know, you could dial a phone number you have memorized while driving.  This terrible design still lives on in their vans and did in their cars until 2017.

Rivian is way behind Tesla and not getting any of the attention Tesla has from consumers.  The only tech we have heard of as part of the deal with Ford is their battery frame.  Great. A Tesla has GPU accelerated machine learning capable computer integrated into every function of the vehicle.  I work in engineering for this types of systems, this is not something you can just throw money at, you need a research team and a CTO that knows what the current tech is.  And what about the engine? Production?  It'll be 2025 at least before we see anything even remotely close to their current competitors.

Meanwhile, I'm seeing more and more Teslas on the streets here.

27,GM," I'm gonna disagree here, respectfully. Anecdotal stories of Ford employee's not being excited about EV's doesn't change the trajectory of the company.  Ford's continued move to EV's, with 30-50% of it's offerings slated to be EV's in 5 years, is inevitable and should help the company overall.  The streamlining of it's Tiered powertrain supply chain alone will help free up cash, and with less capital expenditures (think plant floor space, robots, etc.) they should be able to improve free cash flow and reduce debt.

Ford may not be a product innovator per se.  The Mach E is proof of that.  The three days i spent in one felt like a normal, modern car (just a lot peppier with better handling), they definitely didn't go the space ship route like Tesla.  This could be a huge selling point for them.  People are going to be apprehensive about jumping to EV's.  Making an EV that interacts with you more like a normal car is a good bridge for millions of potential buyers. 
Additionally, lots of buyers are gonna want a dealer network (even if EV's really don't need them).  

Where Ford is innovative is on manufucturing.  They are ahead of GM and even Tesla in shifting to polymer liftgates to take advantage of the light weight characteristics, reduced manufacturing space required, and offloading that rather complex assembly and product development to the tiers (The Mach E uses a polymer liftgate, something Japanese auto makers are way ahead of the curve on).  They built the Mach E, Transit and F150 battery assembly lines lineside next to chassis marriage, that was a measured approach to keep capital costs down while they learn how to build a BEV, and they are learning a lot from each new battery they build.  I think there is potential for this boomer stock.

Fucker started his little speech about how he was going to revolutionize our industry with his superpowers of automation and microservices, blah blah blah... Then, when we started to show that we weren't exactly on board, he doubled down and actually said he was going to make our jobs redundant.

One year later, and we're moved in to what's essentially an abandoned building, all the old tenant's stuff is still everywhere. We have an ""agile coach"" that we meet with every morning, and we're manually converting manuals in to Wiki format, image by image. I get my first new boss in 5 years.

36,GM," Read my comment to the OP. Ford will lose market share and continue to do so. They see themselves as a car company still, not a tech one, and they are light years behind in EV and autonomous. Nobody cares whether they enter the sedan market. Car companies are very cyclical and they run on reputation, and Ford's reputation is really really bad right now. Even if they magically fix all of their problems and somehow start making world class sedans, it'll take years for consumers to change their perceptions. And let's face it they won't. there's so many fun, innovative, and feature-rich options, why would anybody buy a Ford over a tesla? Don't even think about saying cost lol $35k for a tesla is not bad and they'll continue to get more price competitive too. Bmw, VW, Audi, heck GM with their EVs. Ford is and imho will continue to be an ugly duckling. And I don't feel bad at all they did it to themselves.

38,HHR," I know, but the underlying reason for the push to CUV/SUV/Trucks has been a marketing push by the major companies for a rather simple reason: higher profit and CAFE standards. When fuel efficiency standards were increased for passenger cars, a separate lower standard was made for Light Duty Trucks. Manufacturers pushed hard to get as many models of their lineup classified as LDT in order to not have to push better efficiency. One of the grossest examples was the Chevy HHR being labeled a LDT, specifically to skew their CAFE rating.

82,BCE," Jason was already an ancient tale when the owl coins were minted. Most Athenian Owl drachms would have been produced during the Greek classical age, roughly 300-500 BCE. Jason is a Greek Bronze Age figure of the heroic oral histories, very roughly dated to the 1400s BCE. During Jason's time Athens would have not been known as Athens, instead ruled under what we now call the [Mycenaean Civilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycenaean_Greece). There was a massive international collapse of civilizations between these two eras that is sometimes called the ""Greek Dark Ages"" tho I don't like that term.

Jason using an Athenian Owl Drachm is somewhat like Henry the 1st using a US quarter.

83,ID," I basically swing trade around my core positions. If I end up stuck with some shares I don't mind because it's a long term position anyway. But I like to add more on dips and sell the same amount of shares on the rip while holding down my long term position. You have to be able to sell specific share lots. Usually you have to assign to a specific purchase and select the shares by ID in order to do this but Im not sure how it works on other brokerages. I know this was not an option for me on rh or webull. The standard is Fifo. First in first out. Understanding this is key because if you own shares and want to keep them for 1+ years to avoid tax implications, you would most certainly NOT want your oldest and most likely cheapest shares sold when you trim some profits. This raises your cost basis and takes you out of your best shares/position. The best move is to sell your newer shares that were purchased more recently and at higher levels in order to lock profits on your riskier shares and to therefor lower your cost basis back down and you keep your oldest shares. If you can't do this you can't really scalp around a core position without getting fucked. You will always be averaged right around the current stock price and will always be paying short term capital gains tax on all of your gains. Instead of having some 1-2 year old shares you scalp around all day long. Pay tax on THOSE shares and enjoy the appreciation on the older shares which will be tax free. Plus you will be locking profit on the short term shares and lowering your cost basis theoretically by collecting somewhat of a going premium.",mrfilthynasty4141,20,/r/investing/comments/m592rq/equitybased_dollarcost_averaging_methodically/gqz52sa/,0.046,0.715,0.239,0.9969
84,GME," Just on the last point, I've been DCA for a while. I will throw a bit extra in from time to time, but mostly it's just regular, automatic withdrawals. I like it, it's worked out well, but I've definitely kicked myself for not having more cash on hand to buy the dips or other limited time stuff.

I think I had 1000 dollars, which was enough to buy some, but I would have loved to have more cash on hand to buy more of the dip.

But I'm aggressively investing after I budget so I'm not doing too bad.

86,GME," What's high, and what's low? If something drops from 300 to 200 USD, is 200 USD high or low? Depends. If it's GME I'd say that's insanely high considering the fundamentals of GameStop. If it's the SPY I'd say that's a terrific bargain.

Also, this directly opposes efficient market theory. This supposes there are no relative highs and lows, there's only fair price, and therefore any exposure to the market is expected to have the market's rate of return over time, without any potential for added profit when accounting for leverage.

The difference between my post and ""hey guys, buy low and sell high"" is that I propose a methodology that doesn't presume any knowledge about where the actual intrinsic value of the underlying is, and only operates on the assumption that price tends to bounce back and forth more often than expected from a truly stochastic process.

I don't want to presume I know more than the market about intrinsic value and the offset from intrinsic value due to other factors at play. But I do think the market exhibits irrational bouncy behavior. Big financial institutions can't just dump their money out of the markets and sit on cash for many reasons. This causes extended bull runs until a crash comes along and **forces** many market players to rampantly sell off their positions. Hence the bounces.

This strategy profits from the combination of the positive drift of the market and the irrational exuberance that causes above-expected volatility and reversion to mean. Which is a fancy way of saying the market bounces higher and lower than it should in an efficient market, and it does so around some average of past prices.",schravenralph,1,/r/investing/comments/m592rq/equitybased_dollarcost_averaging_methodically/gr2588g/,0.069,0.81,0.121,0.9518
87,RKT," okay broski, then let's break it down.

You state

>Starting in May '68, let's say we started investing with 60 shares for a 6,000 USD position with 4K left in cash. Two months later we hit a low of 88 USD per share, meaning we now own 80 shares at roughly 7,000 USD with a little over 2K in cash. We dip to below 72 in May '70 resulting in 100 shares with 800 USD remaining in cash.

This is inaccurate.  you would buy initial 60@100 for 6000, then buy 20 (wrong) additional at 90 for 1800 more, and then 20 (wrong) more at 80 for 1600 more and you'd have $600 cash not $800.  Why ""(wrong)""? buying 20% at the first stop down would not be 20 shares each time, it would be 12 shares the first time, and 14.4 (round to 14) the second time (20% of existing position), so you're in for an additional $1080 + $1120 for those lots and would be at 86 shares for $8200 (95.35/share avg) and $1800 cash left.

then you state:

>We hit four profit targets on the way up to 105 USD and end up with 80 shares and 2.6K in cash for a total of 11K USD. That's already doubling our profits while significantly reducing our exposure at any given time!

assuming a bottom of 70.01 to make the math easier to follow, and not trigger a third buy that you don't have cash for the full purchase anyhow - you would hit profit targets at 77, 84, 91, 98, 105 and sell 4.3 shares (4 if no partials) at 77 bringing count to 82 shares, then 4 more at 84 bringing count to 78, 4 at 91 count to 74, 4 at 98 count to 70, then 3 or 4 depending how you round at 105 - let's say 4 and count to 66.

You end up collecting $1820 cash from those sales, and have 66 shares @ 105 + 3620 cash total. That adds up to $6930 in SPY and $3620 in cash for a total of $10550.  Yes, you made money.  But had you just bought 100@100, you'd have 100@105 for $10500.  So you didn't double your profits with you trading strategy, you made $50 with trading strategy.  You doubled your profits by taking liberties with the numbers, as I stated originally.

There is something to value averaging, but don't fool yourself with sloppy math.

As for you doing ""the same thing"" with RKT, congrats, you trimmed your position when your ticker mooned - again, that's a good idea, but it's not some esoteric market secret - and you didn't even follow the same formula that you're fighting so hard for that you laid out in your original post.  you just sold chunks for profit rather arbitrarily.  If you got in at 20, then by your own rules you should have started selling out at 22.  You didn't follow the rules you set up, and then it worked out.  That's not evidence that the broken rules work.

Again, you're not wrong, averaging down, trimming up, they're good ideas, but don't let inaccuracy make you fool yourself.",kale_boriak,1,/r/investing/comments/m592rq/equitybased_dollarcost_averaging_methodically/gr0vaha/,0.029,0.853,0.118,0.9899

89,IRR," EDIT: First let me say thanks for the meaningful and civil discussion.  Reddit can often put everyone on the defensive because some subs aren't as well moderated as others, and some people think it's a debate with the goal of pulverizing the other person's point of view.

I wouldn't say I hold indefinitely... I'm happy to take 7-15% IRR on certain investments, depending on the scale... ultimately my preferred metric of portfolio performance is long term CAGR but I'm not dedicated to any one particular hold criterion.

That said, broadly speaking, if a company's market price is rising out of proportion with its fair value or book value, then that usually signals an out for me at some point...  It suggests that speculators have caught on and are prematurely pricing in future events.  So, before that frenzy settles down, I take my profit and move on.

If, on the other hand, fair value keeps rising in proportion to market price, as in the case of Berkshire Hathaway, I'm happy to hold it until that changes permanently... with some capital reallocation here and there.... recently I started shaving off even lots of Berkshire shares as I noticed that analysts kept raising its target price a little too enthusiastically.  I kept half of what I was holding overall.  If it drops, I might acquire more.... but I've been holding this one since at least 2011 and plan to hold some level of shares in this position for the foreseeable future.",th3cr1t1c,1,/r/investing/comments/m592rq/equitybased_dollarcost_averaging_methodically/gr1rxl8/,0.029,0.799,0.172,0.9891

Not to mention the banks *themselves* hate the cludgey, expensive, insecure, duct taped together SWIFT wire system they currently use, have the OK from the OCC to adopt bitcoin, and the Robinhood incident exposed the shortcomings in the system. 

And the annoying thing about this FUD is it's fallacy on top of fallacy on top of fallacy. 

First they backtrack from comparing it to credit when you point out it's a settlement system. 

Then that the economic throughput of a system is not transaction count [alone](https://bitcoinaudible.com/?p=3459) and it doesn't require more energy to move more bitcoin so the system gets more efficient as it scales. 

Then that voluntarily purchased energy use itself is not a negative but the carbon intensity of it and how much is coming from green, stranded, & excess energy (ie hundreds of skyscrapers, millions of commutes, gold mining/refining/transport/security, etc vs mining facilities set up near remote underutilized hydropower). It ironically incentivizes clean energy as expensive urban carbon sources are priced out. Also the irony of swimming in the petrodollar system and virtue signaling about bitcoin if we really want to capture what goes into each. 

And finally that if someone actually cared about energy waste they would start with the least useful applications first (redditing, porn, processed food, netflix) rather than making their crusade against a unique global secure undebasable censorship resistant sound money millions, especially in the 3rd world, are in need of.

Outside ""tax wrappers"", you pay UK Capital Gains Tax when selling stocks & other items (there's a 0% band up to around £12k), and UK dividend tax _on the percentage not already covered by double-taxation treaties_ (15% for the US->UK).

If you're using a stock&shares ISA, you can only _deposit_ £20k/tax year (all kinds of ISAs combined), _but everything is tax-free_ (meaning you don't pay any tax when selling stock, even foreign ones, and only pay the 15% on dividends withdrawn by the US at the source).

165,AMC," I think AMC is worth a buy and not just for the meme. 

AMC may seem dead in the water but it's worth considering that they're a well managed company, and covid restrictions are lifting soon and with increasing vaccinations people are going to be returning to theaters. Plus movie production is picking back up so more releases within a year or so.

On top of that the best argument against them is the prevalence of streaming services which isn't without its merits, but I think AMC can overcome. They have AMC+ which isn't huge yet, but could become more popular with more original content. AMC already makes some good originals and they have the infrastructure to make more in the future. 

Beyond the potential of them improving their streaming services though I still have faith that theaters will do well post-covid. A movie theater is a unique experience that you just can't capture at home. Sure they aren't at peak success, but they are going to recover from where they are now. 

In short I'm holding my AMC in expectation that it will stabilize at a decent price in the near future.",wdrappo,2,/r/investing/comments/m5giuo/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/gr21f1a/,0.056,0.756,0.188,0.9823

171,BYND," I think they've got a huge opportunity and are quite attractive even at the current valuation.

The vegetarian/vegan/plant-based industry is only gonna grow during the upcoming decade, they are growing incredibly fast and are projected massive growth for 2021 and beyond, their CEO has a lot of experience as well. They've recently announced more spots for their products at Target (I believe) as well, which is a very important step to becoming more established. I'd love for them to eventually strike a deal with Kroger, that would really put them over the edge I think.

They occupy a somewhat different space than the current big names in the plant-based sector, which is arguably a good thing for building their stature. And contrary to companies like BYND, they are actually already profitable and projected to become a lot more profitable fast (roughly triple their 2020 EPS in 2022).

They do have some debt and I don't think they've put money into advertising yet, so these are slight concerns, but then again, they've scaled up quite nicely without.",DRMRCX,2,/r/investing/comments/m5giuo/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/gr14bzn/,0.025,0.821,0.155,0.9556

187,STLA," Dear redditors and investors,

I have 150 common shares of Stellantis NV (STLA, Euronext Paris). The company has now undertaken a corporate action of distributing 0.017 shares of Faurecia (EO, Euronext Paris) per share in Stellantis. 

Since I have 150 shares, I would receive 2,55 shares in Faurecia. What happens now? Will I get 2 shares or 3? If I only get one share, will I get financially compensated? 

The ex-coupon date is 15 March, so maybe it’s better to sell my STLA shares now, since I probably can’t do anything with two shares of Faurecia, since the broker costs of selling that share would eat up the gains. 

Any advice on what to do? 

Thanks in advance for your help.

I am still about 17 years from retirement and am considering reallocating a big portion (30 to 50%) or all of it to an S&P index fund for about five to ten years. The reasons being that the S&P Index fund has either outperformed or performed nearly the same as the TDF nearly every calendar year for the past 10 years and has lower fees. The Expense ratio of the Target Date fund is is 0.06% it is currently about 88% equities and 12% bonds. Expense ratio of the Index Fund is 0.02%. My questions are:

1- Is it possible or worth trying to time the reallocation based on current market or investment conditions? Is it wise to transfer in smaller increments to dollar cost average? Or should I just go ahead and request the reallocation with no regard to the current conditions of the market or investments?

2 - I am considering this because I feel like I have room and time for additional risk/reward for the next five years and my balance is now large enough that the additional % gains of the index fund could make a big difference. I also don't see the index fund as much riskier. Am I off base with this? If not, should I just move everything into the index fund not just a large portion.

I need to set something up for my two kids (ages 9 and 7) but don't want to lock them into a 529 that can only be used for school. what's the best route to take? mutual funds in their names? Set up a separate investment account in my name but know its their money? UGMA?

I want them to be able to use the money for what they will need it for without being locked it to college or possibly impact any financial aid or grants they apply for in the future.   Like if they get scholarships and don't need it for education but can buy a house, pay for a wedding, health expenses, etc.  I have also heard horror stories of parents investing for kids in the kids name and as soon as they turn 18, they have legal access to the money to spend on what they want. everyone thinks their kids will turn out angles but i also want to protect against that possibility.

246,RTX," I like this space right now because it has a LOT of future potential, but hasn't yet gotten hit with hype-mania that we often see around new technology.

In other words, I think this space has a lot of potential to become something of a future bubble / hype sector, but also become a very real and profitable space as well. I like the long term potential of EVTOL more than electric cars since I believe there will be far better moats here with a lot less competition. Also has some potential for future crossover with defense industry.

Not saying I would go whole hog on this, but I picked up some warrants as a speculative play on RTX after the SPAC shares crashed back to being close to the initial $10 value.  In my view, the long-term warrants (expire in 2027) present an opportunity for a LOT of upside, where the downside is not necessarily that high.

In other words, I think that ***right now,*** the risk assymetry is heavily skewed to the upside.

That being said, unless WSB catches onto hype in this sector, I'm not sure I would want to play these short term. I would not buy options on these here personally. Overall, I think the macro headwinds to growth stocks is going to be a little bit tough over the next  few quarters. It'll probably help that these are small caps, but I still think these are best viewed as speculative long term call options on a potential new disruptive technology.",cbus20122,1,/r/investing/comments/m599as/the_tale_of_evtols_tickers_of_focus_rtp_expc/gr0nswi/,0.048,0.773,0.179,0.9891
247,EXPC," Agreed and you make all good points. There're a ton of studies validating the 1T+ eVTOL global market in next few years and as I said above, I'm long term bullish on Joby but it'll take strong conviction to hold these stocks over a long time and through a ton of turbulence (no pun intended) as the acceptance for this nascent industry grows. The fact that the hype mania hasn't caught up to this sector makes me even more optimistic. Hopefully we'll see a significant number of new investors looking for the next shiny thing once the EV and GME hype dies down.

My short term play for EXPC is based on how fundamentally undervalued it is and the catalysts lined up ahead. More importantly, ARKX is about to launch soon and I think both EXPC and RTP hits the bullseye when it comes to the sub-orbital category delineated by Cathie for the space ETF. Joby was also named one of the most innovative companies of 2020 by FastCompany mag. You're absolutely right about the WSB factor though.

250,UA," Archer-ACIC has potential too especially with their $1B UA order but it just pales in comparison to Joby in terms of tech expertise, certification progress and real world flight miles. Also, I personally don't think short haul flights will garner a ton of demand until the point the eVTOL rideshare prices match ground based ridesharing and the public acceptance in general increases (Archer's manhattan-JFK pricing of $50 per seat seems a bit too optimistic in next 5 years). Nonetheless, UAM is a big pie and all players have plenty to eat.",sujaykot,1,/r/investing/comments/m599as/the_tale_of_evtols_tickers_of_focus_rtp_expc/gr1et2v/,0.019,0.869,0.113,0.872
