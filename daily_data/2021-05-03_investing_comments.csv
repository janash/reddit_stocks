It’s value is: 1. scarcity, 2. decentralized store of value (you can keep millions in a wallet just by have no a private key, no banks, employees, etc). 

Crypto is not only btc and the incredible rise in defi investment (decentralized exchanges which pay high fees if you lend them your liquidity) is a sign this space is not only scams and shitcoins. 

Thinking that there’s nothing in crypto beyond volatility is thinking like a modest day trader. It is something which was true in 2018 probably, but the appearance of eth and bsc completely changed the scenario. 

Crypto is a decentralized computing machine with open source “hardware” and software that has payment built-in. You won’t need PayPal and co or AWS and GCP in the future.

111,ETH," You don’t, and anyone who says you do is full of shit. 

I am aggressively pro crypto and have been pouring money in to it for years, but the “currency” coins are never going to live up to their promises. People want stable currencies, full stop. So Bitcoin,  Nano, etc will never be used for casual everyday payments since everything is valued in fiat, and your “saving” could drop in fiat value at any moment. 

Utility tokens are where the value is with crypto. There are the currencies used to pay for crypto services, and they are a total new asset class that has yet to be recognized. 

Using Ethereum as an example: the ethereum network can be thought of as a huge decentralized computer, and you pay for clock cycles in ETH. As more and more apps and user populate the network, there are more and more fees paid to the network operators, leading to more and more demand for ETH. This means there is inherent demand for ETH so long as it’s network is seeing usage, and from the charts you can see network usage increasing year over year. 

There are plenty of other projects following this model, and if you are interested in crypto I would highly recommend looking in to this type of token vs just straight currency coins (ETH, TRAC and LTO are my three picks)",biketourthrowaway,8,/r/investing/comments/n3ymmn/best_way_to_profit_from_inflation/gwt9mex/,0.068,0.795,0.137,0.9634

I sort of feel like this is a setup where you're going to link to that graph linking CPI to other ""better"" metrics that you've linked elsewhere, so I figure I might as well address things like ""The Big Mac Index"" here. It's actually super interesting, and you can read about it here: https://www.economist.com/big-mac-index But the big takeaway is that it's not really measuring the ""price of a big mac"".

However most etfs are priced higher than $60. The reason I have seen in the past is lower bid/ask.

A 0.01 bid ask spread on a $100 security as a percentage, is much lower than a $.01 bid ask spread as a percentage on a $5 security.

Also the range is in reach for most retail investors. If you priced it at $3000 a share many people couldn't afford to buy full shares and before fractional shares this locked out retail.

So you want it to be high enough a few pennies bid/ask won't be am issue but low enough retail can easily buy it.

132,MCF," [Desert Mountain Energy Investor Presentation](https://desertmountainenergy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/DME-Investor-Presentation-04282021-FINAL-2.pdf)

I like this company. The first two wells the company drilled return \~4% and \~7.1% helium with a large percentage being Nitrogen which can be vented. A small portion is CO2 and CH4 which they plan to sequester. There are trace amounts of other rare earth gases which are expected to essentially offset the refining costs of the raw helium gas, which the company is building their own solar powered facility for. They are about to drill 3 more wells and are expected to be in production by 21Q4. Customers are close, which is important since helium is tough to contain and transport, I have seen estimated losses as high as 1% per 100 miles. Customers have signalled a desire to pick up their own helium (and transport at night to lose less helium in the arid climate of Arizona), further reducing capital costs for DME.

DME expects to produce from the first two wells at a rate of 4100-5600 MCFGPD combined. Since the well with \~7.1% Helium is approximately 95% of the combined flow rate between the two wells, I used 7% as my average helium grade in the following calculation. At a price of $1000USD/MCF for refined helium (99.5%+ He) that yields revenues of \~$104M USD at the company's low end flow rate estimate of 4100 MCFGPD for just the first two wells. Margins are expected to be very good and the company has communicated that the cash flows from the first 6 wells should fund drilling and production costs going forward and does not expect to further dilute shareholders (I guess there is a bit of an assumption in there that they hit some helium with wells 4, 5, and 6).

I am long DME and am still accumulating. Warrants have been accelerated, and 8.2M shares worth are due to be exercised by May 24th, 2021 at an exercise price of $2.00. I think buying in the $3.50-3.75 range is palatable. DME recently uplifted to the OTCQX markets from the OTCQB and to me that signals aspirations of a more major listing in the future. FY2022 profits could be over $100M USD even with the build out of a refining facility and further drilling if they produce at the upper end of the range the company has signalled and get better prices than I have assumed (quite possible, I used the lowest value for refined helium I could find \[$1000-$3400/MCF\]).

148,AMZN," Hi,
Almost a couple of years ago I bought an apartment under construction, which will be delivered this year - I already paid 20% of its value.

I'm 32 years old and I've been basically putting my savings in a bank account for the last 9 years (since I started working) - not too wise I know :D

I haven't really been into investing until last year, where I started following the bogleheads approach and also playing around with some stocks.

Now I'm considering 2 main options:

1. Full payment of the apartment, keep around 10k€ in my bank account. Then start investing monthly with most of my salary savings (~2k/month to index funds + stocks)
2. Get a 30y mortgage, in my country current fixed interest rates are around ~1,5% (french amortization method). Invest most of my current savings right now. Keep adding monthly savings to investments (~1,6k/month).

I guess financially its clearly better the second option as long as you get a higher return from your investments than the mortgage interests but on the other hand, there is the factor of easy sleep every night knowing that you have no debts... 

In the second scenario, my intention would be to add half of it to my current Vanguard Index funds, and the other half to  APPL, MSFT, AMZN, GOOGL to basically buy&hold for a long period.

I know this is a very personal call... but I'd really appreciate reading your thoughts/experiences with mortgages and investments :)

189,EPR," Cineplex, a Canadian operator, had received a buyout offer from cineworld (uk) before the pandemic. Of course cineworld retired the offer , but a trial will begin in September . They may find an agreement at a lower price than stated before , but still at premium compared to today’s price

190,IMO," Why don't you just split your funds between VTI and FLCH and not think about which will perform better?

Trying to work out which will do better over the next year is very difficult if not impossible. And ignore the news, honestly. Bad news is more often a good sign than a bad sign for prices IMO, or at least, it's an unreliable indicator",dubov,2,/r/investing/comments/n3tkix/bullish_or_bearish_on_china_flch/gwrzubp/,0.126,0.693,0.181,0.5098
191,EM," If you believe in mean reversion theory then FLCH is still a little (10-15%) overpriced on a historical basis going off of forward PE’s. However, VTI is very overpriced on a historical basis. These things are really hard to predict on how events will unfold. It seems you’re an index fund person - you could branch out from FLCH into VWO and diversify your China bet a little. Personally I would keep some exposure to China, hard to ignore what will be the largest GDP country in the world by the end of this decade.

I’ve looked at this from quite a few angles and I can tell you what I decided to do with my money. I bought an EM value fund which gives me China/Taiwan exposure (half the fund). Then I picked and chose the Chinese tech stocks I wanted to own (just Prosus and BABA). Definitely not for everyone and goes against the index investing grain. I will make a plug for Tencent you’re essentially buying a tech VC firm and I’d much rather Pony Ma was managing my Chinese investments than myself.",Investing8675309,1,/r/investing/comments/n3tkix/bullish_or_bearish_on_china_flch/gws3oi5/,0.033,0.938,0.029,0.0552
