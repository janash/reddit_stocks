183,PKG,"That's why it was bottomed out. Nobody wanted to be associated with it or didn't believe in it most probably. Thing is, what's the real reason PKG let themselves be acquired by this looney concept of a company . Clearly something big is brewing out there.  Even if the Alzheimer device is a flop, PKG alone can easily sustain current market cap and I believe it will organically grow based on PKG business alone without anything related to the device. Now I am playing into PKG vision. They have seen something if they agreed to be acquired and not just partenering up. They are setting up trials in Poland AFAIK. We still don't know what is going on. We need ATM PKG acquisition confirmation and up to date sec filings that follows this . After that, we need to see what is coming up next. But anything related to Alzheimer is difficult as is related to brain. That's why we are in 2020 with no answers yet. If that device shows cognitive improvement in alzheimer , that is a big succes in the industry as it doesn't require any risky surgery for it

One more thing: this thing can be a flop and a scam ,but If they drag it along properly and does proper PR about it, this thing can still go nuts. I ve seen bigger scams people put money into than an attempt to treat Alzheimer. But as I said, PKG business alone should make current mkt cap safe to hop into",0.094,0.836,0.07,-0.7509

Allen Premium Outlets will be one of four local shopping centers with COVID19 testing sites.(Jason Janik / Special Contributor)

Simon Property Group, the largest U.S. mall operator, is leasing space to a COVID-19 testing lab operator at four Dallas-Fort Worth shopping centers and several others in Austin, Houston and San Marcos.
Outdoor testing kiosks under the brand Collection Sites will open by early February at Allen Premium Outlets, Grapevine Mills and North East Mall in Hurst. A testing site will open at Firewheel Town Center in Garland, another Simon-owned center, soon after.
The labs are operated by Medivolve, formerly QuestCap, a Canada-based company that recently changed its name as it emphasized a focus on medical services and technology.

The relationship with Simon is one of the testing lab‚Äôs biggest, said Ava Bahnam, chief operating officer of Collection Sites. The expansion into Texas already includes locations in Austin and Cedar Park. Others are coming soon to Simon malls in Houston, including Katy Mills.

Stonebriar Centre in Frisco, which is owned by Brookfield Properties, is also scheduled to get a testing site.
ÔøºOutdoor testing kiosks operated by Canada-based Medivolve under the brand Collection Sites will open in late January 2021 at four area malls. Simon Property Group has leased space for the COVID-19 testing sites at Allen Premium Outlets, Grapevine Mills, North East Mall in Hurst and Firewheel Town Center in Garland.(Medivolve)

While Americans are beginning to be vaccinated, there‚Äôs still constant need for testing and experts believe that will be the case for some time.
Each site can provide up to 150 tests a day and results within 24 hours, with charges ranging from $59 to $179 for antibody and antigen tests. The company accepts most insurance plans.
Rapid tests for COVID-19 antibodies take no more than 10 minutes and are delivered by text or email. Appointments and payments are handled through Medivolve‚Äôs online portal:¬†testbeforeyougo.com

Medical offices have been a big part of mall redevelopments in recent years because the properties are well located along major highways or at major intersections. Malls are also big employers and have a need for onsite testing, Bahnam said.
Results for the quick test that can detect antibodies is available in 10 minutes. ‚ÄúPeople also need testing results before they can go back to their jobs after being exposed or sick with COVID-19,‚Äù Bahnam said.",0.02,0.946,0.034,0.7096

I'm doing nothing differently than I was doing with $500 except for making $200 - $500 bets instead of $100 bets.

The issue with a small value account is even if you hit +100% gains on a $100 bet, you only have $200. Why go through all the effort required to find good bets and make smart investments for such little gain (if you could afford to play with more).",0.0,0.748,0.252,0.9892

Here is some information about Noram Ventures for those who are interested in the #lithium and electric vehicles industry.  Baterry is the key element of Electric cars.

&#x200B;

Over the past several decades, the number of electric vehicles (EVs) has continued to increase. Projections estimate that worldwide, more than 125 million EVs will be on the road by 2030. At the heart of these advanced vehicles is the lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery, which provides the required energy storage. This paper presents and compares key components of Li-ion batteries and describes associated battery management systems and approaches to improve the overall battery efficiency, capacity, and lifespan. Material and thermal characteristics are identified as critical to battery performance.  

&#x200B;

Albemarle Corporation (NYSE: ALB), the world‚Äôs largest lithium producer, recently announced that it is planning to double the production capacity of its Silver Peak mine in Nevada (the only lithium brine producer in the U.S.) by 2025. ALB is allocating a US$30 ‚Äì US$50M budget for this initiative. ALB also announced plans to explore clay resources in the region. This is very positive for Noram as its 100% owned Zeus lithium property is just 2 km from the Silver Peak mine.

**Highlights** 

* Noram has completed five of a 12-hole resource upgrade/expansion drill program totalling 1,440 m. The program is targeting mineralization to a depth of up to 500 ft. The existing resource on the project only accounts for mineralization to a depth of 100 m. Assays from the first three holes were encouraging as all three showed potential mineralization to depths of up to 400 ft.
*  Based on the initial drill results, we speculate the company has increased its resource by at least 50%.",0.008,0.907,0.086,0.9633
