(the ""Underwriter"") in connection with an underwritten public offering (the ""Offering"") of 14,500,000 shares (the ""Firm Shares"") of the Company's common stock, $0.001 par value per share (the ""Common Stock""). The Underwriter has agreed to purchase the Firm Shares from the Company at a price of $1.7625 per share. Under the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, the Company granted the Underwriter an option, exercisable for 30 days, to purchase up to an additional 2,175,000 shares of Common Stock (the ""Option Shares"" and together with the Firm Shares, the ""Shares"") at the same price per share as the Firm Shares.   
The net proceeds to the Company from the Offering, excluding any exercise by the Underwriter of its 30-day option to purchase any of the Option Shares, are expected to be approximately $25.6 million before deducting estimated offering expenses payable by the Company.

Now that I've gotten up to $70k, I would say the unlimited day trades are pretty much useless to me because the best plays (in my experience) are medium-term or medium-short-term holds, not positions you would open and close within a trading day. I haven't used a day trade in a couple months, and the only time I reached the day trade limit (which was toward the beginning) it had a negative impact. 

That's just my personal strategy though. I see entry/exit points for day traders all the time when I'm watching the charts in real time, and I expected to be more of a day trader when I started. Now it's solely swing trading so I don't have to be as hands on.",0.043,0.853,0.104,0.8126

But if I don't see the line graph spiking or dropping second by second, I don't get FOMO as much and I make smarter trades on TD and I hold things for longer, which I have found is beneficial.

Shits bonkers. But basically here is why you‚Äôre right but wrong.
EVERYONE is screaming bubble bubble bubble. But really they are still dumping cash in high risk (equity) in the market. Now this would occur anytime the fed holds interest rates low. 

HOWEVER whats occuring is that people are being handed money while the stock market is accessible and cool! So while institutional investors were switching from bonds to equity (natural process), your average joe schmoe saw a bunch of green flashy lights, so he followed. Then when he got rich, then his friends got rich and so on. 

Now where are we going? 
Savings are up. Unemployment is up. Missed rental payments are up. Why is the market not down???
Because of liquidity.. the ability for everyone to pay their debts and move on.
How will it fall? It will only take one massive company to fall 20-30% in one week and then a liquidity crunch will cascade throughout. If the indexes are hit enough you‚Äôll have a domino sell off..

Simon Property Group, the largest U.S. mall operator, is leasing space to a COVID-19 testing lab operator at four Dallas-Fort Worth shopping centers and several others in Austin, Houston and San Marcos.
Outdoor testing kiosks under the brand Collection Sites will open by early February at Allen Premium Outlets, Grapevine Mills and North East Mall in Hurst. A testing site will open at Firewheel Town Center in Garland, another Simon-owned center, soon after.
The labs are operated by Medivolve, formerly QuestCap, a Canada-based company that recently changed its name as it emphasized a focus on medical services and technology.

The relationship with Simon is one of the testing lab‚Äôs biggest, said Ava Bahnam, chief operating officer of Collection Sites. The expansion into Texas already includes locations in Austin and Cedar Park. Others are coming soon to Simon malls in Houston, including Katy Mills.

Stonebriar Centre in Frisco, which is owned by Brookfield Properties, is also scheduled to get a testing site.

While Americans are beginning to be vaccinated, there‚Äôs still constant need for testing and experts believe that will be the case for some time.
Each site can provide up to 150 tests a day and results within 24 hours, with charges ranging from $59 to $179 for antibody and antigen tests. The company accepts most insurance plans.
Rapid tests for COVID-19 antibodies take no more than 10 minutes and are delivered by text or email. Appointments and payments are handled through Medivolve‚Äôs online portal:¬†testbeforeyougo.com

Medical offices have been a big part of mall redevelopments in recent years because the properties are well located along major highways or at major intersections. Malls are also big employers and have a need for onsite testing, Bahnam said.
Results for the quick test that can detect antibodies is available in 10 minutes. ‚ÄúPeople also need testing results before they can go back to their jobs after being exposed or sick with COVID-19,‚Äù Bahnam said.",0.02,0.946,0.034,0.7096
