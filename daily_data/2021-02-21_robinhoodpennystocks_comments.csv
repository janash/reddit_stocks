New Age Metals NMTLF is a Junior Miner with multiple claims across Canada and one in Alaska. 

Over the course of 2021 they’ll be advancing their Palladium project as well as some of their Lithium claims which also contain Rare Earth Elements.

The pandemic brought Jr Mines everywhere to a halt because they weren’t able to hire drill teams and they weren’t able to get Assay results from the lab. 

If a Jr Mine can’t produce news articles, on a regular basis, about the drill results and overall advancements of the mine, then they can’t attract investors.

Palladium

The primary usage of Palladium is in the Catalytic Converter of gasoline vehicles and as environmental restrictions get tighter, auto makers will need more Palladium in the Catalytic Converter. 

Prices are soaring for Palladium (NY Times Feb 9, 2021)

New Age Metals has about 2.9 million ounces of Palladium, Measured & Indicated, which makes their Ontario claim a huge reserve, one of the biggest. They also have another Palladium claim in Alaska that’s unexplored. 

Lithium

7 Lithium/REE claims in Manitoba, drilling in an area full of Lithium. They’re in an area with lots of Lithium claims being explored by several other companies. 

New Age Metals is the largest claim holder and three of their claims are ready to be drilled this year. They’ve already gotten a small grant from the government for drilling and are applying for phase two of that grant because the results looked good. 

The one element in the chemistry of a Li-Ion battery that can not be substituted for another, is Lithium. The world needs a lot of Lithium.


Outlook

New Age Metals NMTLF is a Junior Miner which means they’re pre-production. You could categorize them as being Exploration Stage because they’re still drilling and defining the resource on their properties and because they’re pre-construction. 

This is an early-stage mine and there’s a variety of ways to play this. It will take years to bring any of these projects online. This can be a good very long-term play, however in the shorter term, I believe this will also be a good investment. 

Expect to see a rise in share price as they advance their various projects over the course of this year. The Lithium prospects are the most exciting and the REE in the Lithium deposits, along with the two Palladium claims are just bonuses.

Having REE locked up in the Lithium deposits helps lubricant government grants in order to drill and explore the claim.

As drill results come back from the Assay lab with good news, the share price will rise. Eventually they'll raise more money through various ways such as issuing shares via private placement, selling unnecessary claims, or by bringing in JV partners.

The reason we can expect good drill results is because Lithium has been discovered around that whole area and there's multiple companies at work now drilling and exploring. Overall its a massive resource and its all the way up to the surface. In the case of New Age Metals, they’re the largest land holder, with 7 claims in that area alone, three of which are drill ready for this year. 

If you take all of that and combine it with the investor excitement around the subject of Lithium and REE, I just don't see a realistic scenario where the share price stays anywhere near its current level.

Like many posters mention here, I am wary and disillusioned by the “fairness” of trading due to the way stocks are manipulated by large and powerful financial organizations. The selling of our trading data isn’t protected. For us “little people” the risks are greater. But to the original OP’s point, stop losses can be used to help mitigate risks.

(Try to make your cost basis per share good folks!)

I have a long stake for it on Fidelity but as far as my Robinhood goes, I am contemplating selling it on Monday. Guess I’ll see its price action and see if it naturally rises back a bit.

Currently owns 12 carriers compared to CTRM 8. Never declared bankruptcy like CTRM either.
