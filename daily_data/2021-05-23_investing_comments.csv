31,TA," This is gonna sound incredibly dumb especially because I have been trading for some time but not have received a good answer from the start. Why does any news affect a stock at all is my question. The only thing moving the stock price is buyers and sellers, that is it, and of course options as well as short sales etc. it’s really just a game to buy as Low as possible and ride the high and sell high leaving the rest as bag holders, because when you sell high someone has to buy that and they are the ones who lose. But why does good news need to make a stock go up or bad news make people panic sell. It’s not like you actually own a piece of the company nor do you care how the company is actually doing. A day trader also isn’t gonna be flipping stocks that pay dividends often or anything so really it’s just a game where you can gain an edge using TA. So once again why the hell does any news matter??

Fossil fuels are in a weird spot because society would crumble without them for the next couple of decades. Oil is still needed. And even after that, oil is needed to produce all kinds of products needed for almost all industries. Far less will be needed, but a smart gradual ramp-down of production is likely to occur regardless.

I also agree that the world can be harsh and that entertainment is necessary - but cigarettes are a source of relief for people insomuch as the big tobacco industry has created, developed, and propagated an addictive product and strategically embedded itself in cultures around the world to convince people that they're necessary. I will argue that cigarettes are simply bad, full stop, and the world would be a better place without them. 

So taking a step back from discussing the necessity of these companies and products, my original question is about our investment agency more than the existence of the companies: At what point do we as investors disqualify investment in these companies based on the morality of their business regardless of how stellar their divs might be?

My argument is that we shouldn't invest in tobacco or oil companies as a proxy of collective demand that (a) tobacco companies go bankrupt or shut down such that we move on from a world with addictive, cancer-causing tobacco products and (b) oil companies invest their profits in renewable infrastructure, cleaning up the messes they've made in the environment, and decarbonize/divest from continued oil infrastructure development.

120,XOM," > My argument is that we shouldn't invest in tobacco or oil companies as a proxy of collective demand

I think a counterargument would be that the collective demand of consumers has voted on many of these things, and at least some investors are simply choosing to embrace trends that they have no personal control over.

For example, the move to SUVs is basically erasing all emissions gains from small cars and electrification, [based on energy predictions from the IEA](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/14/suvs-will-ensure-oil-demand-grows-for-decades-warns-iea). I have no interest in them and think they have made driving worse; but I have no control over the mass of consumers. Consumers are literally voting with their dollars for a *more* carbon-intensive lifestyle. At some point people are just going to say ""if you can't beat them, at least make money off them"" (which frankly sounds like something from the Ferengi Rules of Acquisition).

One interesting take I saw on Bloomberg a few months ago was that XOM was facing a confluence of problems (IIRC, can't find it again - I think it was a Kara Swisher piece) from declining refining profits, shareholder demands to maintain the dividend, and pressure to move to renewables (but no money to do so effectively).

133,IMO," I've been in TCELX (T Rowe China Equity Evolution) since mid last year when it opened and it's been beating its index pretty well. It's not a pure Hong Kong play though. T Rowe has feet on the ground there plus they have a disciplined track record. I'm hoping it ends up as successful on the China side of things as their old Japan Fund...the later of which has done so well they closed it to new investors.

IMO there's alpha to be made in the market which is why a global firm like T Rowe has an edge. No offense to any locals there...but it seems that in aggregate Hong Kong investors are pretty easy to exploit. In general you'll see lots of performance and bubble chasing. People cram into whichever local mutual fund has the best recent performance. If a fund is doing badly, the firm will simply close it and start a new fund. This is not unlike what happens in the US but people have still not caught on.

Personally I have no faith in HK market because of political climate (of HK and US-CHINA relations), HK has been experiencing slow economic growth since 2008.

There was a lot of hype around Tencent, well there still is. But I don't want to get into it because of Jack Ma and CCP's active interference now. I don't think anyone can quantify that political risk.

143,GE," Storaging electricty is difficult as we know. Let's think about the different technologies to do that.

- Hydro with pumping reservoir. Water is pumped to reservoir during low electricity price and then ran through turbines during high price. Not very efficient, but solid and proven technology. Large reservoirs needed.

- Electricty to hydrogen using electrolysis. Hydrogen is the hot topic of the day and many companies are pursuing on it. Using electrolysis during low electricty price to produce hydrogen and then using modified gas turbines to produce electricity during high prices. Big utilities with own gas fleets are already investing the topic. Maybe lot of business for companies like Siemens and GE modifying already existing turbines?

- Batteries and superconductors are great for smoothening demand peaks, but not that great for storaging large amounts of electricity. However, they will also play a part in this transition.

152,DD," Hydrogen seems like a promising alternative for energy storage (and in Europe seems like its going to be the main focus) but I feel like other batteries such as Zinc-Air / Redox Flow batteries can become important especially to fill in the gap in > 8 hours energy storage. They are still being developed (someone already mentioned $*MGXRF / $ZAIR - Zinc8* in the comments) but from what little DD I've done on this company and subject these are some of the conclusions:

1. **Zinc is a readily available and cheap material**
2. **Reusability** \- none of the materials in the battery are actually consumed and as opposed to Lithium Ion (Li-Ion) batteries  they dont have the problem of becoming less efficient with time. If they did become less efficient it would be a matter of renewing the electrolytes as opposed to having to change the whole battery.
3. **Better scalability than Li-Ion batteries -** to scale Li-Ion you basically have to add more stacks of batteries but with Zinc - Air batteries you can simply increase the volume of the tanks containing the electrolytes which makes it cheaper (the caveat being that since they are less energy dense the break even point with Li-Ion battery is at *above 8 hours of energy storage* \- in simpler terms if you need to store ***less*** than 8 hours of energy you're better off with Li-Ion)
4. **Safer -** unlike Li-Ion or Hydrogen these batteries ***don't*** require a controlled environment to operate and aren't flamable which also means that security measures are less strict on sites where these are installed. This in turn also makes them cheaper to deploy.
5. **Still in infancy** \- the technology is in development, has yet to prove it's worth and aren't commercially widespread yet. A few of them are being implemented in defferent places (NYC and Australia are testing them for now) but feels like it could be promising.

I might've missed something so if you want to add to this feel free to do so!

165,BOOM," Hydrogen itself is tough. It has a LOT of downsides.

1. Stupid wide explosive limits (low H2 / high air = BOOM, high H2 / low air = ALSO BOOM). When in doubt, BOOM.

2. Energy density sucks unless you have really really high pressure tanks (remember BOOM?) or cryogenics to liquify it (energy and $$).

3. Being a very light and small molecule, hydrogen will diffuse right through metal tank walls. It's not leaking...it's diffusing right through the metal. Fill a perfectly intact tank with hydrogen and wait and the pressure will drop.

However, I am somewhat interested in a related technology: ammonia manufacturing using hydrogen from water electrolysis combining it with nitrogen in the air. Right now we make most ammonia from methane gas using steam reforming and the Haber Bosch process. 

We use a lot of liquid ammonia for crop fertilization and chemical processes and eventually need to get that off of fossil fuel sources. Also, ammonia will burn in air as a liquid fuel, and it nominally produces only nitrogen and water vapor as byproducts, which might make it an attractive no-carbon renewable liquid fuel for internal combustion engines.",Mysterious-Gas-1973,4,/r/investing/comments/nj9vfs/who_are_the_players_in_energy_grid_storage/gz7cmjv/,0.097,0.837,0.066,-0.6342

Then I'll try to understand what the company does and look at true free cash flow & off balance sheet items. I try and find companies with low debt, and try to buy within 20% of a 52 week low. I'll look at sales growth, profit margin and asset turnover.

Leverage produces earnings growth but not abnormal earnings growth, so any growth that is created by leverage is not to be valued.

I screen companies using enterprise value/EBIITDA, deb to equity <0.5, current ratio between 1.5 and 2.5, (depending on the industry) look for stable BV growth, EPS and div growth, and FCF to revenue > 5% plus a few more, I'm not super strict on screening and I'll rarely find a company that fits all my criteria.

Then I'll try to understand what the company does and look at true free cash flow & off balance sheet items. I try and find companies with low debt, and try to buy within 20% of a 52 week low. I'll look at sales growth, profit margin and asset turnover.

I look at ROCE and if ROCE changes I look at what's driving the changes in ROCE - is it driven by financial leverage rather then business operations? Leverage produces earnings growth but not abnormal earnings growth, so any growth that is created by leverage is not to be valued. If forecasted ROCE is > required return then Value > BV (positive residual earnings)

Then I'll look at management, track record etc although I don't put too much of my analysis into this, and also look at whether insiders are buying or dumping shares. I'll read over annual reports etc and reformulate the financial statements, looking at Net Operating Assets (NOA) and Return on Net Operating Assets (RNOA) to name a few. Then I'll use either a residual earnings model or a DCF model depending on the company, using a margin of safety of course.

I prefer value companies to growth companies, as value will always win in the long run, and prefer a consistent dividend pay-out so I get those compounding returns to buy more undervalued companies.

EDIT: OP you seem to be on the right track, the more you practice the better your financial modelling skills will be.

176,DD," I have posted several DDs to Reddit.

Honestly, I think people place too much emphasis on financials during their screening process. 

I save the financial analysis until after I understand the business. Then I screen out if I don't like the financials.

Reading books from Phil Fisher or Buffet's Berkshire letters and things like that are helpful I think to figure out your own approach.

179,DCF," I screen by companies trading below 3x book value.  Then I narrow it down to manufacturing, distributing and reselling... I generally avoid banks, tech, and other business models that are hardest to value.

197,GL," 

Generally speaking you are talking about a trailing stop.  A trailing stop follows the price up. Once the price tops, your stop is set as whatever you put in.  Maybe you put 2% or 50 cents.  If the price falls to your current stop it will trigger an order.  If the price falls but doesn't hit your stop then rises again, your stop will follow it up again to the next high. 

The risk is getting stopped out too soon.  You can't set your trailing stop to begin above the current price.  Which means if it dips as soon as you set it, you are stopped out.  The other risk is volatility. If the stock price is trending up but is bouncing on the way up, it can hit your stop and execute.

This page is useful for understanding this concept with examples.  https://tradingsim.com/blog/set-trailing-stop/

229,FL," For used cars i think you can get a wholesaling license in a lot of states.  There are people who buy trade ins from dealers and then take them down the road to used dealers or lots that sell that model vehicle and sell them.  My dad did this way back in the day. Go to the Chevy dealership and buy their Ford trade ins they want off the lot.  Take them down to the Ford dealership and sell them for more.  
  
Edit: a step further is to buy cars in AZ or FL where cars are under valued and ship them to markets where used cars are over valued.  The same can work with certain vehicles.  Like buying uses 4x4 trucks in Texas and selling them in the North. Or buying certain imports from rural areas and selling them where there is higher prices.",sherlocknessmonster,1,/r/investing/comments/nj7peo/real_world_arbitrage_oppurtunities/gz6xoys/,0.0,0.907,0.093,0.8957

235,NAV," SPACs tend to take several months before making waves, so if I were interested in this particular one, I'd probably wait a bit after the IPO before jumping onboard to see if it settles near NAV (generally around $10/share, but depends on the SPAC)

I'm invested in $ACTC for their Proterra merger and I'll be watching $IRRXU closely too for the same reason (general bullishness of mass transit and electrification)",totally_possible,1,/r/investing/comments/nj7d6c/integrated_rail_and_resources_acquisition_corp/gz5rur3/,0.0,0.93,0.07,0.7033
236,AMAT," Materials sector will get decimated once supply glut hits.

Right now commodities prices are at ATH because of massive undersupply. However supply is getting built out at a crazy rate and the demand spike for a lot of these goods is likely temporary.
This isn't new or unusual, commodities super-cycles are they are known are fairly frequent phenomena. Some people get very rich on the way up, some people get left with some very heavy bags and a few people get very rich on the way down.

Correction in commodities pricing will be violent and brutal. Similar to the bond market commodities are traded using highly levered products called futures so when the crash starts happening (it already has) it will go down very fast.

The other bubble which is probably a year or 2 out from peaking is semiconductor stocks. For now supply is constrained but fabs are being built out massively on a scale never seen before. Again this isn't new, semis have a boom/bust cycle like commodities. It's just this one is much bigger and will take longer to play out.

Unlike commodities, bonds or crypto this one will take a lot longer to deflate. I expect NVDA, AMAT and ASML to be hit the hardest by this.
