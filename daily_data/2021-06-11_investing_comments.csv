0,IMO," IMO the next crash is going to be caused by the ""subprime"" debt. Literally today money is free to get. Prices will go up and this will cause people taking on more debt. Regarding the stock market I expect more Archegos like blowouts. It would be nice to see how many people bought overpriced stocks (meme stocks for example) with leverage. I believe that many people bought Tesla for example with a lot leverage at some point and if they fall beyond that point people will get margin called massively, which will cause the bubble to burst.",vulture_capitalist_,17,/r/investing/comments/nx4wzz/the_sp_500_pe_ratio_is_the_highest_its_been_since/h1dfcjk/,0.074,0.841,0.085,0.2911
1,IRS," $120,000,000,000 per month has been injected into the economy for years as part of the FED's QE. According to the NYFED's January paper on racial and wealth inequality, that money has funneled primarily into the asset and housing markets. Combine that with the recent IRS leaks and the fact that we've seen historic growth for the wealthy, I'd say we're 100% in a bubble.

My personal theory has been that we'll keep going up until the FED pulls back on the QE program, at which point who knows how far we'll drop. But that's also assuming a pseudo prisoner's dilemma for the wealthy. The market will go up as long as they're all investing, but the moment some of them pull out it would cause a cascading effect of sell-offs inducing a self-fulfilled drop. However, who knows if a stray needle will be enough to pop the bubble before I actually get to test my hypothesis.",_NeCedeMalis_,4,/r/investing/comments/nx4wzz/the_sp_500_pe_ratio_is_the_highest_its_been_since/h1e0p9y/,0.039,0.887,0.074,0.5346

37,RCA," Now we’re arguing semantics. What you’re describing seems to be a bull market. The term bubble is tossed around far too easily. 

The interest rates justify the P/E ratios, not indicate their insanity. I don’t think you understand how this works. We had five times higher interest rates during dotcom with twice as high valuations. That’s a bubble. Valuations are higher than the Great Depression because the value of our companies today are obviously a million times higher. You’re telling me RCA is as valuable as apple or Amazon? Also interest rates were higher. There isn’t widespread mania. It’s in small pockets.

Mainly that economists may be missing some correlations here and have thus far been incompetent in predicting where we'll be in the next 24 months. Such as every steel analyst on the planet last year in October saying HRC futures were too high and unsustainable at $800/t and now we're north of $1,600/t and they are finally acknowledging that these prices may be sustainable into 2022-2023.",Botboy141,1,/r/investing/comments/nx4wzz/the_sp_500_pe_ratio_is_the_highest_its_been_since/h1g0hb6/,0.11,0.818,0.072,-0.5859

42,USA," You got the main reason as to why it's unlikely which is Japan's low imagration rate and slowing population, we also have the reserve currency which gives us a big advantage against many other countries, however the largest reason is that the states are still the world's largest consumer market, we love to buy and it's also the most import economy in the world. In 1990 when Japan crashed the USA and most of the world was unaffected same with the Asian financial crisis and even the Eurozone crisis the rest of the world made it out rather unscathed, however when the us financial system collapsed in 08 the whole world went under, the biggest reason against a japan style crash is the USA is just so important to the world economy in a way japan wasn't. As for parallels, Japan's bubble really kicked of after black Monday when the BOJ lowered rates to 2.5%, this is quite similar to how the FED lowered rates due to the covid crash, it's also interesting that after Japan's Nikkei recovery from black Monday there was a couple of months when it was rather flat before it kicked into high gear in 1988, I suspect after this short stagnation in our markets we will also see another leg up.",ilai_reddead,11,/r/investing/comments/nx4wzz/the_sp_500_pe_ratio_is_the_highest_its_been_since/h1dh0b5/,0.099,0.852,0.049,-0.8668

As a former cannabis business owner, I couldn't stand the how they charge arbitrary prices and have dispensaries bid against each other, driving the price up. However, from an investment stand point, more money the better. There still isn't a better way to find local dispensaries and deals. Leafly has a garbage app and is mainly used by dispensaries in Oregon and Washington. Weedmaps is already the biggest player in the epicenter of the cannabis industry. Google is also horrible at finding dispensaries and deals. In addition to most dispensaries having buggy websites, Weedmaps has everything in one place.

I understand the market they're trying to capture but, jeez, they'll need to be suuuper aggressive getting the product in front of consumers and dispensaries for the next few years to make it stick by becoming the default.  Competitors could pop up at any time and do the same things they are IMO.  

I guess understanding the legalese of each jurisdiction helps but I don't see that being a huge advantage.  Current laws are anticipated to change and evolve in each state over the next few years - how is Weedmaps going to remain the expert when laws are literally just being written/changed?  Everyone is on an even playing field at that point IMO.

I keep seeing the claim that they're not just ""Yelp for weed"" but the more I read and listen the more it seems like that is exactly what they are.  ""Pay us to advertise on our platform.  The more the pay the higher your land on search results.""  Also, in that video he really doesn't address what I see as potential competitors when it comes to delivery.

60,CS," > It's more a speculative get rich quick investment than being based on concerns with the dollar for most

You gotta keep in mind- just like with stocks, there are tons of 'penny stock' type networks that will draw in a certain type of investor.

At the same time, a good handful of crypto-networks have some *really* interesting real world usages. The underlying network technology is the really important part - the currencies/tokens are generally used to buy access to the network functions.

These networks are not just for moving money around- that's just one of the more obvious functions. 

These things are full-package global security, identification, and verification networks that are likely to lead to some *real* interesting advances in things like identity and credentials verification. Think job recruiters being able to instantly verify if a CS degree from University of Ethiopia is real or not, and whether or not it's intentionally credentialed just by doing math problems that take a computer nanoseconds to do.",RandoStonian,0,/r/investing/comments/nwzbu3/what_makes_the_price_of_gold_go_up_inflation/h1cpsuj/,0.015,0.84,0.144,0.9625

People who obviously have 0 knowledge of computer science, wouldn't know if a data structure hit them in the face, fascinated by REALLY REALLY interesting usecase of an inefficient convoluted data structure that has so far produced 0 impact. 

I've got a hint for you, the really interesting usecase of cryptography you are referring to have already been widely used for the last two decades and have standard protocols like TLS.",FreeRadical5,1,/r/investing/comments/nwzbu3/what_makes_the_price_of_gold_go_up_inflation/h1fios1/,0.024,0.811,0.164,0.93
62,PKI," Yes, but until public decentralization came along, you more-or-less had to rely on corporate servers, or some kind of home-grown setup that has zero guarantee of being available 5-10 years in the future.

I see these networks as being more like a framework for digital mailboxes for a new(-ish) type of package, secured from the ground-up with cryptography, where money transfers happen to be the #1 they're used to secure & validate right now.

Something these networks can provide that we didn't really have much of before is reliability *without* being at the mercy of the whimsical policy changes of a single government, or a small handful of corporations. 

Hosting a database of public keys on AWS to emulate what crypto networks are incentivizing in PKI is great - as long as everyone who wants to use it is on good terms with Amazon and any governments Amazon is dealing with, and is okay with the idea that Amazon can change their policies and shut the key server down at any time for any reason.

With globally usable identity networks for example- if the central servers are hosted in the US because they're in charge, does the US have the right to revoke a British citizen's digital driver's license because of an unpaid US parking ticket from an old tourist visit?

These are the kinds of questions that make decentralized security networks a particularly interesting longterm prospect - see things like Microsoft's ION project that provides decentralized identity services by borrowing security guarantees from the existing Bitcoin network.",RandoStonian,1,/r/investing/comments/nwzbu3/what_makes_the_price_of_gold_go_up_inflation/h1fm6wj/,0.0,0.798,0.202,0.995

75,AMC," After the CPI report this morning caused some volatility I liked the action the led into the afternoon. I started a position in silver and silver miners that is a little more than half of what I will allocate toward this trade. I’ll add the rest on a pullback or breakout. Stops are set below the lows for May. 

From what I can see the masses have completely forgotten about silver. They think it’s highly manipulated (they’re right) and there is no potential. They would rather focus on where the momentum is and stocks that have already multiplied their values in the last few weeks or even days. I think silver is ready. Let’s see where this goes.

On meme/squeeze stocks I’ve made money on GME, AMC, BB, CLNR, TR, REV, SPCE & BYND in the last month. Yesterday I said I would probably sell my meme stocks before the end of the week. This morning’s action scared me and I took more profits pre-market and the rest hit my raised stops shortly after the open. 

I took profits early and made sure each trade had minimal risk, each position was profitable by selling a partial position early, and I raised stops on the rest. Don’t be greedy and take each opportunity you get for what you can and move on. This goes for meme stocks and all trades as a general rule. 

Meme stocks may have another run, but have a plan that will give you a controllable amount of risk before getting into these volatile stocks if they go the wrong way.  I may get back into these but right now risk is too high.

There is much better risk/reward in silver and natural gas (see my past posts). Both have the ability to set a close stop loss, and huge potential.

They've been rising since the beginning of the year and uranium demand should be increasing apparently in the next few years.

Is this too late to jump in ?

Some of them are penny stocks, and I've always heard that a noob like myself should avoid penny stocks. But if we're expecting the demand to rise, could be a smart move ?

Plus, the market seems willfully ignorant of it all, the 10-yr yield actually fell yesterday and NASDAQ closed even higher...

93,NIO," Who else got their NIO ticket already? 


Even at the current price NIO is still hugely undervalued. The only reason I can think of is because it's a Chinese company and many people are skeptical or have been burned by one in the past. However, NIO continues to prove the haters wrong.

Despite the current chip shortage, NIO has still managed to increase YoY deliveries. At the same time they have managed to improve upon their already impressive margins.

Although their market reach is limited mostly to China right now, that will change in the very near future. They are slated to reach the European market in September, and my guess is that it won't be too long before it reaches the U.S. too. And when that happens, it certainly doesn't hurt that Brian Deese, the head of the National Economic Council, has previous ties to BlackRock, which has a large stake in NIO.

There are several articles available in which owners of both NIO and Tesla vehicles discuss their experiences with both. And the vast majority end with claims that after driving the NIO, they won't go back. 

NIO has been downplayed by too many for far too long. It won't be long before the stock price hits triple digits. Get your ticket before it leaves for the moon.",jmains45,-2,/r/investing/comments/nxbfn6/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/h1fjfvi/,0.054,0.873,0.073,0.3769
94,GME," I've never really understood why the folks at r/investing hate ""meme stocks"" like gme. Are you guys too stubborn to even give GME a look because of your worldview? Just because GME is a ""meme stock"" doesn't mean that it doesn't have ""fundamentals"" as every analyst says. Ryan Cohen has brought a dream team into GameStop. The new Ceo and Cfo have had spectacular careers at Amazon. Do you think they would join a ""failing company"". Also, gamestop is making the shift to ecommerce with ryan cohen at the helm. 

Furthermore, have you considered that everything you were taught was merely a way of financial institutions to fleece you guys into being content with 7% gains? Financial media is owned by the people who are at the top of the corruption chain and wall street. Do you think that they would ever tell you the truth? In 2008, media was not reporting the true reason behind the GFC, do you think that they would do so now? With all the naked shorting that GME investors have uncovered. The systematic danger to the system due to the discoveries by gme investors. \*Yes I know CNBC is reporting on naked shorting at the moment, BUT is it not obvious that they had to? Clearly Melissa messed up and either they suck it up or just go all in. To which they decided to go all in. Also did no one notice the change in tone? Back in January, they kept on saying that the shorts covered, but with the ""discovery of naked shorts"", it's clear to me that they didn't cover. This is just one example of the media not taking your best interest in mind.\*        
 
Furthermore, Investing should be for everyone. Just because an investor does something outside of the norm doesn't mean that they should be disparaged for doing so. Just because gme investors say that they're ""dumb"" doesn't mean that they don't deserve to be heard out and be taken seriously. GME investors are ""dumb"", but guess what, gme investors made more money than anyone of you guys could dream of and exposed the corruption in the system which none of you guys could do by merely following what mainstream ideas tell you to do. With GME came all these legislations and new rule changes at the DTCC, OCC which help create a more transparent market. The change that forces institutions to report short interest daily rather than monthly. The changes of risk/margin reporting from monthly to daily. All things talked about by gme investors as means of financial institutions kicking the can down the road due to the insane naked shorting of gme which can't be covered. 

To conclude, maybe just maybe, confront your world views and take a good look at gme and everything that the gme investors have discovered, maybe you'll realize something. Or maybe not? Regardless, just because an idea might seem ""dumb"" to you because of all the financial education you've received, doesn't make it actually dumb. Expand your horizons and start questioning the purpose of media, the financial markets and then maybe you'll understand what gme investors are doing.",WolfMan2b,-8,/r/investing/comments/nxbfn6/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/h1f57k8/,0.077,0.851,0.072,-0.5152

The new Ceo and Cfo have had spectacular careers at Amazon. Do you think they would join a ""failing company"". Also, gamestop is making the shift to ecommerce with ryan cohen at the helm. 

Furthermore, have you considered that everything you were taught was merely a way of financial institutions to fleece you guys into being content with 7% gains? Financial media is owned by the people who are at the top of the corruption chain and wall street. Do you think that they would ever tell you the truth? In 2008, media was not reporting the true reason behind the GFC, do you think that they would do so now? With all the naked shorting that GME investors have uncovered. The systematic danger to the system due to the discoveries by gme investors. \*Yes I know CNBC is reporting on naked shorting at the moment, BUT is it not obvious that they had to? Clearly Melissa messed up and either they suck it up or just go all in. To which they decided to go all in. Also did no one notice the change in tone? Back in January, they kept on saying that the shorts covered, but with the ""discovery of naked shorts"", it's clear to me that they didn't cover. This is just one example of the media not taking your best interest in mind.\*        
 
Furthermore, Investing should be for everyone. Just because an investor does something outside of the norm doesn't mean that they should be disparaged for doing so. Just because gme investors say that they're ""dumb"" doesn't mean that they don't deserve to be heard out and be taken seriously. GME investors are ""dumb"", but guess what, gme investors made more money than anyone of you guys could dream of and exposed the corruption in the system which none of you guys could do by merely following what mainstream ideas tell you to do. With GME came all these legislations and new rule changes at the DTCC, OCC which help create a more transparent market. The change that forces institutions to report short interest daily rather than monthly. The changes of risk/margin reporting from monthly to daily. All things talked about by gme investors as means of financial institutions kicking the can down the road due to the insane naked shorting of gme which can't be covered. 

To conclude, maybe just maybe, confront your world views and take a good look at gme and everything that the gme investors have discovered, maybe you'll realize something. Or maybe not? Regardless, just because an idea might seem ""dumb"" to you because of all the financial education you've received, doesn't make it actually dumb. Expand your horizons and start questioning the purpose of media, the financial markets and then maybe you'll understand what gme investors are doing.",WolfMan2b,-8,/r/investing/comments/nxbfn6/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/h1f57k8/,0.077,0.851,0.072,-0.5152

111,IMO," As someone who has been buying and selling crypto for 7 years, here is my advice. 

1. We're still in the midst of a crypto hype/bull cycle. There could be some more rallies, but ultimately I would hold off investing until we see things stabilize at a new floor for a few months and we see new investors (such as yourself, no offense), cooling their jets on crypto markets overall. 

2. Don't invest more than you're willing to lose. We still have no idea what the governmental or regulatory future of crypto could entail. It's still prone to manipulation and wild swings caused by single individuals and institutions. 

3. Don't just get into crypto because everyone else is doing it. Have a plan. Hold for a few years. If/when you reach the point of profitability, start to take gainz. Could very well go higher, but it could also go lower. I made a hefty profit selling coins between December and April that I've been holding for 1-3 years. The people buying right now are nuts IMO, although I am certainly thankful they were willing to buy my bags.

Also have TD/TOS which was more for growth speculative stuff like $SENS and RCYE. Looking at/for great potential but just not quite there yet; pennies even. Also, my preferred platform for options. Not doing anything serious, still learning, so I’m only working one contract at any given time (now). But I got caught up in meme hype by trading AMC. And it messed with the PL numbers for what this account was meant to accomplish. 

So I moved those AMC over to Webull since it is a more reader friendly app (Fidelity/TD/ToS apps are clunky to me for trading)

Anyhoo. The point is, each of these three have their own portfolios, their own money, and I treat their allocation differently. 

Obviously the investment is near 100% allocated. I try to leave some cash in the event I want to get in to something

My growth brokerage is about 5% allocated 

And the trading one no more than 1% total. So basically with a $10k cash account, most I’ll have in play is $1000

You gotta have real tricks to beat insiders and the connected. They aren't going to just gift you $billions because you caught them in an act.

I would rather take paper cutting tactics to brute forcing.

For example. 

JPM is just down....good company. If  A pes just buy and hold, pump it, give it momentum. They could actually raise the price some and sell out without risking everything and getting hammered by illegal backsides.

Right?

Novice investor here. I browse r stocks, investing, and wsb frequently and sometimes see posts of DD, and others just boasting a ticker with no DD at all—but usually they include the disclaimer “but do your own DD”.

Is anyone aware of a great post summarizing key steps and considerations for DD? I like the thought of evaluating a stock for potential, etc., rather than jumping onto a ticker that already has loads of attention, but feel overwhelmed as to where to begin...

144,DD," >posts of DD,

Even lots of post labeled DD are not DD as they don't include very basic financial information.

I would say you need to have a bit of financial knowledge before doing the most basic DD

First learn how to read financial statements (Balance sheet, P&L, Statement of cash flows) and understand what each is telling you and what they represent

Then understand a few of the core financial ratios , now I always say you cannot just look at one ratio like PE and make a decision only on one, you have to look at everything to get the full story and these ratios are also useful to compare the company vs competition or other companies in their same sector.

Then look at things like earnings/revenue growth , how those financial ratios change year to year .

Finally read through their last few years of filings or at the very least their last few 10k filings and read them cover to cover(very boring yes)

Now even then if this is your first time doing this all this probably won't tell you much if you only look at one company, because you may need to compare and contrast the companies numbers with other companies in the same sector or even different sectors to see how they compare .

Now this would be what I consider the most basic DD, to take it to the next level you really need to understand the business , its products and offerings how they compare to their competition , management even things like corporate culture ect.

EDIT

I also forgot one big topic, really research a bear case for the company . I think we can all do selective research and find what we want or spin the numbers in a positive light, but really go out and look for the bad , the risks, and really come up with a bear case too . At least read and really give consideration to what the bear case is to try to avoid confirmation bias",SirGlass,4,/r/investing/comments/nxbf2z/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/h1emhfi/,0.04,0.923,0.037,-0.6124

"" Here are some that I like. By no means an exhaustive list:

**QQQ** \- This one uses the NASDAQ 100 as its benchmark. Obviously it's an Indexed, non-managed ETF. XTF used to rate this one as a perfect 10.0 out of 10 rating, but recently dropped it to 9.9 out of 10. It has one of the highest rates of return over the past 10 years of any ETF. It does tend to be tech-heavy, especially with the FAANG +M stocks.  (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google and Microsoft).  Other top holdings include TSLA, NVDA and ADBE.  (The rating dropped recently when the portfolio of the NASDAQ 100 was re-balanced).

**VXUS** \- Vanguard Total International Index Fund ETF - top holdings include BABA, Tencent, Samsung, Taiwan Semiconductors, Novartis, Toyota. This is a broad market fund investing only in companies overseas.  I'm not generally bullish on foreign markets, but this one is a very solid ETF with some companies that are likely to do extremely well for the foreseeable future.  XTF rates this one a perfect 10.0 out of 10.

At the suggestion of u/Here4TheCatPics, I'm also going to include **EFA** and **EEM**. These are Emerging Markets ETFs.  Both have some crossover in their top holdings with VXUS. **EFA** is rated 9.6/10 by XTF Analysts and **EEM** is rated only 5.7/10. **EEM** appears to be heavily invested in the Chinese market with Alibaba and TenCent the top two holdings. It also holds quite a bit of cash for an ETF. **EFA** appears to be more tilted toward the European market. 

**VOO**/**SPY** \- **VOO** and **SPY** are non-managed funds indexed to the S&P 500 Index. These funds are very popular on this subreddit, for good reason. They are well diversified, broad market funds investing in mostly US stocks. XTF rates these funds at 9.6 out of 10 because their return on investment over the long term is somewhat tempered by some of the blue chip stocks in the funds. But those stocks also help reduce volatility relative to some other ETFs. These are solid investments, but keep in mind that in the top 10 holdings there will be a lot of crossover between these funds and other broad market funds that hold US stocks like **QQQ**, **VTI**, **VTG**, **VOOG** and **SPYG**.  There are differences, of course, as well, but you always want to know where those duplications exist.

**IWF** \- This is a Russell 1000 indexed fund. It is one of my favorites that doesn't get talked about much. It does have a lot of crossover with the other funds mentioned above, but the mix is slightly different.  I would describe this fund as more aggressive than **VOO/SPY**, less volatile than **QQQ**.

**IWM** \- for someone looking to diversify a little bit, this is a great fund to look into. This fund is a non-managed, indexed fund that uses the Russell 2000 index as its benchmark. The big difference between the Russell 2000 index and many of the the other indexes is that the Russell 2000 index looks at small and mid-cap companies, rather than large-cap companies.  Thus, there is zero crossover between this one and the funds mentioned above. While this fund will move up and down with the market, it is often less volatile than the market overall. If you look at the charts, this fund has under-performed some of the other funds over the past few months while the market has been very volatile in an upward direction, but in a crash, this fund would probably outperform the rest of the market.  It has a 9.0/10 XTF rating.

There are also some sector funds you may want to look at:

&#x200B;

**ICLN**/**TAN/FAN** \- These funds are clean/renewable energy ETFs. ICLN is more broad while TAN focuses more specifically on solar energy and FAN specifically on wind generated energy. I think renewable energy companies are the future. There is no crossover in the top holdings of this fund with the top holdings of QQQ and most of the other broad market funds. Also, these are global, not just US based companies.  QCLN and PBW are also renewable energy funds, but they also contain a lot of TSLA, NIO and W.K. H.S. in their top holdings making them ""electric vehicle"" funds, as well.  No problem if you want to add that, but you'll find a lot of Tesla in some of the funds mentioned above.

**ARK** group of funds: **ARKG**, **ARKF**, **ARKK ARKW**, **ARKQ**, **PRNT** and **IZRL**. These are managed funds investing in companies that invest in disruptive companies in their respective industries. Most posters on this subreddit are bullish on these funds. They are aggressive growth ETFs, but should be considered somewhat risky and volatile.

* ARKG - Genomic Revolution
* ARKF - Fintech
* ARKK - Disruptive Companies (broader market)
* ARKW - Internet/computer/technology  (Telsa is a top holding)
* ARKQ - Robotics and artificial intelligence
* PRNT - 3D printing technology
* IZRL - disruptive companies based in Israel

XL series of funds.  Similar to the ARK series, these tend to be more aggressive growth funds, however these are passively managed indexed funds with various benchmarks that usually are overloaded in the better companies within a sector:

* **XLV** \- Health Care
* **XLK** \- Technology
* **XLY** \- Consumer Discretionary
* **XLF** \- Financial
* **XLU** \- Utilities

At the suggestion of u/Shaun8030, I'm adding Cloud Computing as another sector to consider.  Some tickers in that sector include:  **WCLD**, **SKYY**, **CLOU**, **BUG** and **XIKT**. Of these **WCLD** has the best 52 week performance.  Top holdings in **WCLD** include **ZM**, **PLAN**, **CRM**, **CRWD**, **ZEN**, **WDAY**, **TENB**, **PCTY**, **DDOG**, **BL**.  Many of these are likely to also appear in **QQQ**, however, they would be in very small percentages as the Cap on these companies is much smaller.

Read through the comments below. Many users have posted some other great suggestions, as well.

***A nice portfolio might look something like this:***

20% - Broad market US fund such as QQQ, VOO or IWF

20% - VXUS - International

20% - IWM - Small/Mid-cap broad market fund

10% each in four sector funds of your choice

Hope this helps.

*I'm not a financial expert or advisor and this is not financial advice, just an opinion from a random internet person.  I do own shares in several, but not all of the funds listed above, including QQQ, IWF, some ARK funds, ICLN, VXUS, etc.*

At the suggestion of u/Shaun8030, I'm adding Cloud Computing as another sector to consider.  Some tickers in that sector include:  **WCLD**, **SKYY**, **CLOU**, **BUG** and **XIKT**. Of these **WCLD** has the best 52 week performance.  Top holdings in **WCLD** include **ZM**, **PLAN**, **CRM**, **CRWD**, **ZEN**, **WDAY**, **TENB**, **PCTY**, **DDOG**, **BL**.  Many of these are likely to also appear in **QQQ**, however, they would be in very small percentages as the Cap on these companies is much smaller.

Read through the comments below. Many users have posted some other great suggestions, as well.

***A nice portfolio might look something like this:***

20% - Broad market US fund such as QQQ, VOO or IWF

20% - VXUS - International

20% - IWM - Small/Mid-cap broad market fund

10% each in four sector funds of your choice

Hope this helps.

"" Here are some that I like. By no means an exhaustive list:

**QQQ** \- This one uses the NASDAQ 100 as its benchmark. Obviously it's an Indexed, non-managed ETF. XTF used to rate this one as a perfect 10.0 out of 10 rating, but recently dropped it to 9.9 out of 10. It has one of the highest rates of return over the past 10 years of any ETF. It does tend to be tech-heavy, especially with the FAANG +M stocks.  (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google and Microsoft).  Other top holdings include TSLA, NVDA and ADBE.  (The rating dropped recently when the portfolio of the NASDAQ 100 was re-balanced).

**VXUS** \- Vanguard Total International Index Fund ETF - top holdings include BABA, Tencent, Samsung, Taiwan Semiconductors, Novartis, Toyota. This is a broad market fund investing only in companies overseas.  I'm not generally bullish on foreign markets, but this one is a very solid ETF with some companies that are likely to do extremely well for the foreseeable future.  XTF rates this one a perfect 10.0 out of 10.

At the suggestion of u/Here4TheCatPics, I'm also going to include **EFA** and **EEM**. These are Emerging Markets ETFs.  Both have some crossover in their top holdings with VXUS. **EFA** is rated 9.6/10 by XTF Analysts and **EEM** is rated only 5.7/10. **EEM** appears to be heavily invested in the Chinese market with Alibaba and TenCent the top two holdings. It also holds quite a bit of cash for an ETF. **EFA** appears to be more tilted toward the European market. 

**VOO**/**SPY** \- **VOO** and **SPY** are non-managed funds indexed to the S&P 500 Index. These funds are very popular on this subreddit, for good reason. They are well diversified, broad market funds investing in mostly US stocks. XTF rates these funds at 9.6 out of 10 because their return on investment over the long term is somewhat tempered by some of the blue chip stocks in the funds. But those stocks also help reduce volatility relative to some other ETFs. These are solid investments, but keep in mind that in the top 10 holdings there will be a lot of crossover between these funds and other broad market funds that hold US stocks like **QQQ**, **VTI**, **VTG**, **VOOG** and **SPYG**.  There are differences, of course, as well, but you always want to know where those duplications exist.

**IWF** \- This is a Russell 1000 indexed fund. It is one of my favorites that doesn't get talked about much. It does have a lot of crossover with the other funds mentioned above, but the mix is slightly different.  I would describe this fund as more aggressive than **VOO/SPY**, less volatile than **QQQ**.

**IWM** \- for someone looking to diversify a little bit, this is a great fund to look into. This fund is a non-managed, indexed fund that uses the Russell 2000 index as its benchmark. The big difference between the Russell 2000 index and many of the the other indexes is that the Russell 2000 index looks at small and mid-cap companies, rather than large-cap companies.  Thus, there is zero crossover between this one and the funds mentioned above. While this fund will move up and down with the market, it is often less volatile than the market overall. If you look at the charts, this fund has under-performed some of the other funds over the past few months while the market has been very volatile in an upward direction, but in a crash, this fund would probably outperform the rest of the market.  It has a 9.0/10 XTF rating.

There are also some sector funds you may want to look at:

&#x200B;

**ICLN**/**TAN/FAN** \- These funds are clean/renewable energy ETFs. ICLN is more broad while TAN focuses more specifically on solar energy and FAN specifically on wind generated energy. I think renewable energy companies are the future. There is no crossover in the top holdings of this fund with the top holdings of QQQ and most of the other broad market funds. Also, these are global, not just US based companies.  QCLN and PBW are also renewable energy funds, but they also contain a lot of TSLA, NIO and W.K. H.S. in their top holdings making them ""electric vehicle"" funds, as well.  No problem if you want to add that, but you'll find a lot of Tesla in some of the funds mentioned above.

**ARK** group of funds: **ARKG**, **ARKF**, **ARKK ARKW**, **ARKQ**, **PRNT** and **IZRL**. These are managed funds investing in companies that invest in disruptive companies in their respective industries. Most posters on this subreddit are bullish on these funds. They are aggressive growth ETFs, but should be considered somewhat risky and volatile.

* ARKG - Genomic Revolution
* ARKF - Fintech
* ARKK - Disruptive Companies (broader market)
* ARKW - Internet/computer/technology  (Telsa is a top holding)
* ARKQ - Robotics and artificial intelligence
* PRNT - 3D printing technology
* IZRL - disruptive companies based in Israel

XL series of funds.  Similar to the ARK series, these tend to be more aggressive growth funds, however these are passively managed indexed funds with various benchmarks that usually are overloaded in the better companies within a sector:

* **XLV** \- Health Care
* **XLK** \- Technology
* **XLY** \- Consumer Discretionary
* **XLF** \- Financial
* **XLU** \- Utilities

154,ELSE," The text is misleading , it essentially is implying if a brokerage goes bankrupt or something, and your shares are held in the brokerages street name, the brokerage can just take those shares and pay out to creditors.

Now this statement may be technically true, but guess what you would be a creditor with secured debt , meaning you would be very first in line to get paid out your shares before ANYONE ELSE.

Major brokerages going bust is pretty rare but we have a classic example of bear sterns , now people invested in bear sterns (stock, debt/bonds) lost money in their investments but bear was also a brokerage that held other holdings for clients, the SIPC didn't even have to get involved as there were no claims of lost securities .",SirGlass,5,/r/investing/comments/nxc9my/risks_of_holding_stocks_in_a_street_name/h1einep/,0.126,0.748,0.126,0.2732
155,UK," My understanding is that the tax on dividends is withheld by the company issuing the shares or by the dividend tax withholding agent.

The stockbroker only collects and processes the information about which customer is a tax resident of which country and provides the information to the dividend tax withholding agent or to the company issuing the stocks.

In some cases maybe the stockbroker is the dividend tax withholding agent.

When the dividends are from US or Canada the stockbroker usually takes care of providing necessary information in order for the correct tax on dividends to be applied automatically. (Example of such stockbroker is Interactive Brokers ([proof](https://ibkr.info/article/861)).)

However, some stockbrokers like eToro do not take care to process the necessary information in order for the correct tax rate on the dividends to be applied (i.e. for US dividends: 15% for UK residents, 10% for Bulgarian tax residents). They apply the default tax rate instead (30%).

I am looking at the problem from a non-US-centric viewpoint (as a tax resident of a country other than the US).

Stockbrokers typically do not withhold tax on capital gains, I never encountered such a case.

> They sadly withhold 30%, eToro personal agent told me that they were working on it but could provide no ETA so take that statement with a bit of salt. The 30% vs the 15% I would normally have is a big 
disappointment.

156,IRS," Ahh - ok - so your post is a bit misleading. It's really not related to having shares held in street name. Sounds like you are asking about a tax question.

I am in the US so I can't comment about how non-US brokers handle it. But what I can say is that in the US - there are tax treaties with other nations that account for it. 

For example, I own shares of foreign ordinaries in other countries that make a dividend. So what happens is that my dividends are taxed by that foreign government at whatever rate they charge for non-residents. When I file my taxes in the US, the US tax code allows me a foreign tax credit so that I am not double paying taxes in the US. 

It will vary for non-US residents paying taxes in their home countries. 

But a foreign resident who holds a US stock that pays dividends are subject to a 30% withholding. That is US tax-code and it looks like eToro is doing it correctly.

157,IR," >I even don't know if there is a practical way to hold stocks (of  publicly traded companies) directly instead of in a street name.

There are ways to hold stock directly. Some large public companies have direct purchase plans. One of the bigger transfer agents is Compushare - you can check it out. Or if you are interested in a specific company - you can check out the IR section of their website. But obviously - it is a lot more inconvenient and there may be additional fees. 

Some companies may still even issue stock certificates. Disney used to issue some really cool looking stock certificates and some of them are considered collectibles.
