0,EIC," I recently listened to The Anarchy (rise and fall of East India Company). I may be brutalizing this as a paraphrase summary but I never before realized the intimate continuity of this story of greed.

Forgive me if I screw any of this up: EIC basically rapes and pillages India from a position of corporate colonial governance backed by the British. The resulting famine kills 33% of Bengals population (widely considered a man-made famine due to hoarding for profits).

The resulting losses for the EIC were staggering. They decided to recoup their losses from the other colonies. This leads to them shipping tea to the American colonies.

The colonies were aware of what happened to the Bengal colony when the EIC had free control. We all know what happened to that tea, and the symbolic first chapter of an independent America.",kingmi123,5,/r/stocks/comments/mxx2m9/history_about_stock_market/gvtfc58/,0.164,0.784,0.052,-0.9623

4,NDAQ," Hey kind of a dumb question and I know I can easily look this up, but how exactly does the NASDAQ as a stock index and NASDAQ as a stock exchange differ? Is the index just an overall number associated with all of the stocks traded on the NASDAQ exchange?

Why is that only the case for the NASDAQ — i.e., why don’t we commonly see indices for the NYSE or the LESG? How does the NYSE differ from the S&P or the DJI for example, do they include different subsets of stocks traded on the NYSE?

Last question — and this may help me wrap my head around this topic a little better in general — what are the actual, real-world consequences of different stock exchanges nowadays? I get that back in the day you’d need to actually *go* to the physical stock exchange to trade specific stocks, but that’s not really a thing anymore with online brokerages. So how do they play out in the real world today, is there a significant difference for me as a retail investor trading a stock that’s on the NYSE or the NASDAQ? I’m in the US, so I understand that foreign or OTC stocks usually have a commission associated with them, but how else does it play out? Other than lower volume/liquidity perhaps. 

Props to anyone that tackles these questions — thanks in advance! I’m going to look this stuff up on investopedia and see if I can wrap my mind around it.

Okay now I’m more confused. So the actual NASDAQ *company*/*stock* is itself listed on the NASDAQ *exchange*, which is included in the S&P 500 *index*, is that right?

5,DD," Some historians say it was, some say it wasn't. OP says:  


>Belgium had the world's first stock market(without actual stocks) back in 1400's.

Which already sounds confusing. How can you have stock exchange without stocks? Since OP didn't add sources, what he means by this is speculation. In the early 14th century, Bruges was a center of trade in Europe. People would trade in the city square and stuff. In 1285 the *Ter Beurse Inn* was established. An inn run by the prominent Van der Beurse family that housed foreign merchants. The square where the inn was located was where a lot of trading was done. This is where the word beurs (bourse) comes from. The inn, square, trading together make an argument for being the first exchange, with the inn later becoming a place where solely trading was done. [More on all this here.](https://thetchblog.com/2020/09/07/the-original-bourse-at-bruges/) 

[Trade then shifted to Antwerp, where in 1531 the first purpose-built commodities exchange building was established.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourse_of_Antwerp) So that's a Belgian contender, I suppose. 

The first place where *stocks* were exchanged is [Amsterdam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euronext_Amsterdam). In 1602. By [the Dutch East India Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_East_India_Company). You know, the company that was established in 1602 and is mentioned by OP in his second point:  


>The East India Company is widely recognized as the world’s first publicly traded company  

And then there's many more interesting contenders for world first exchanges. Ultimately it doesn't really matter which was first. It's all fascinating history worth a read. Oh, also:

The top 10 list from OP doesn't make sense to me. I was surprised the LSE had a bigger market cap than the Euronext, but even more so bigger than the Shanghai and Hong Kong exchanges. Looking around I can't find any data supporting the list. I also notice OP listed a whole bunch of exchanges, and uses the [Stock Exchange Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Stock_Exchange_Group) for the London one, which is more than just the LSE. [Most top 10's I can find look like this](https://www.tradinghours.com/markets) or similar. Different order than OP's for sure.

I appreciate the idea of this post. And I realise it's fluff and saturday entertainment. But for a sub that should value research like no other, it's a bit disappointing. Hopefully it lacks a bit of depth because OP put all their effort into doing DD for their portfolio ;)",LeWigre,5,/r/stocks/comments/mxx2m9/history_about_stock_market/gvu9auj/,0.029,0.863,0.108,0.9816

I'm hardly one to judge but I don't think you're crazy. 

I'm bullish on BABA but I think the recovery will take a little time. I also think that will happen before the end of the year and may all happen in a few days. Here are the catalysts imo that take it back to $300:

1. ~~BABA pays big fine for anti-competitive practices~~
2. ~~Agrees to drop pick-1-of-2 rule (which of course they have to b/c RCEP)~~
3. Jack Ma divests from Ant Group. I think there's fire under this smoke. The CCP does love winning personality conflicts and divesting Ma from Ant would be their favorite kinda fuck-you without costing the company anything. BABA/Ant can still be all the behemoth they want to be without Ma. Still Ma's exit could take a few weeks to sort-out the details. I think Ma might be less peeved about it than people think. There's a chance he was going to exit Ant after the IPO anyway, sorta like he moved-on from BABA.
4. Ant Group gets greenlight for IPO as a normal-ish bank (not a loan-writing factory). That's going to be like at $20 day for BABA easy imo. There's just so little bear case for BABA outside of ""well, the CCP is gonna git 'em!"". Once all the shoes have dropped, BABA's P/E might shoot back up to other tech giants. 

Once Ant IPO's and (perhaps) Ma is out of the picture, I think you might see the CCP flipping script and getting back to pushing BABA (and similar companies) to expand and grow into the markets that RCEP has created. The anti-monopoly actions are alibi's for the WTO dimension of a future conflict the CCP is interested in winning: the battle for pacific market expansion. The PRC needs the appearance of due diligence. They want to look like a country that's hard on monopolies and still have monopolies. (Same as the US). RCEP is the biggest trading block on the planet. The US isn't in it. And the PRC finished it on the heels of 4 years of the most fucking moronic foreign policy execution in the history of the USA.

Ah gawd, this is already way too long. Here's some more funny stories real quick:

Donnie almost pulled the US out of the South Korean Free Trade Agreement on a whim one day. John Kelly snaked the piece of paper off of his desk and Donnie didn't notice. Did Donnie get mad the next day when his plan to blow-up the economic component of one of the US's most critical alliances in the pacific didn't happen? Nope. He forgot. So everyone just moved-on.

Donnie pissed and shat all over many of our alliances, but Australia, Japan, South Korea, and NATO were probably some of the most moronic own-goal type zero-upside shittings. Asking NATO members for $ was fucking stupid when Russia is clearly the most potentially aggressive adversaries in the region. Same with withdrawing missile defense tech from the ROK for no reason with no concession (it wasn't there for the North Korea fyi). Read the transcript of his call with the PM of Australia about the boat refugees and tell me Donnie's IQ is 3 digits.

His foreign policy was damage control done by John Kelly (until he quit to become the CEO of the baby jailing company that had been banking \~$740 a day/kid on the border). And then John Bolton (whose damage control amounted to 15 sneaky things done to try to trick Donnie into going to war with Iran...which ultimately Putin wouldn't allow Donnie to do). After Bolton quit, it was literally asleep-at-the-wheel foreign policy for several months.

Those months coincided with the time that the PRC was likely finishing negotiations of the RCEP. Its not an accident that they inked the thing just a few days after the Biden election was conclusive. RCEP was a brilliantly timed geopolitical execution by China to lock-in a tremendous soft-power advantage throughout the Pacific (including Latin America when you get down to it) that was created by the vacuous and mis-managed years of the dumbass donnie doctrine.

You sound like a tool.

Some people are definitely concerned with the tensions in Taiwan and the South China sea, especially with the US getting involved.

Yeah those two words are super difficult...

Chinese stocks have never traded at their full potential due to the CPP.  That has always been the case.  Now the whole Chinese market (not just Baba) is being held down because of relations between BABA and the CPP? I can understand that you think it has nothing to do with an escalation between China/US, but many people do.

You don't need to invest in Apple, but reading the SEC filings of a stable company with nothing to hide (they make money hand-over-fist, they don't need to risk the bad PR) serves to illustrate what an honest report looks like.

92,DD," I learned a lot about DD when I started teaching myself technical analysis. Whether you believe in TA or not, understanding what the indicators are meant to reflect about the stock really opened my eyes to what actually drives stock price.

For example if the stock price is dropping, and volume is also dropping, then maybe investors are losing interest and the price is likely to keep bleeding unless something changes. If price drops but volume is rising, maybe investors are losing confidence or profit taking, maybe you can expect a quick rebound and see the drop as a good entry point.

From there the question is *why* is the volume dropping/rising and you can start learning what events affect the stock's price, etc.

111,AMC," It’s hard to say beyond the general tactics like not even filing the SEC report on time, multiple times, or having your CEO give a speech but the information in the SEC report excludes it entirely to avoid getting caught up in lying. 

An example of when you would expect to find a CEOs media statement in the SEC filing would be the recent AMC situation. The CEO of AMC went on record in an interview making a promise, and to prove he was serious about the promise AMC filed the transcript as a document in their SEC filing. Had he not done that there would be nothing binding him to that promise. 

Other tactics are hiding financial information in subsidiaries and things like that.

119,SQ," I'm going to disagree here and say that VTI is actually a lot better than VOO, and also that any total market fund is better than the S&P500. A couple of important reasons: factor investing and front running. TLDR, but VTI, buy some VXF, get rid of VOO.

First, factor investing, Small caps over time perform better than large caps because of their higher risk premium and the company's size and maturity. Since VTI has small cap exposure, there is should be slightly higher risk, but also higher returns. In recent years, the performance of VOO has outpaced VTI because small caps have actually underperformed due to the rise of large cap tech, but this is not the case historically or from a risk premium standpoint. You can see this if you include periods of small cap outperformance for example between 2003 and 2007. If you include this period, SPY went up 391% and VTI went up 449%, excluding dividends.

Second, front running. Some people might not know that the S&P500 does not actually hold the 500 largest companies in the US. VTI and total market indices actually hold many companies that have larger market cap than many of the s&P500 companies. For example Square (SQ), a favorite around here, has a market cap of 112 billion, or around the market cap of Intuit (INTU), the 76th largest companies in the S&P500. The reason for this is that the S&P500 index itself is not exactly passive but have requirements of market cap, longevity, profitability and quality as well. Why is this important? because since the index changes continuously, you would know when a company will be included or excluded. Since so much money is invested in the S&P500, you would also know that when some company has been included, there would be a ton of forced buying from those passive index funds. And if you know that there will be a lot of buying of the stock on a certain date, investors can and will front run this buying by increasing the stock price and pulling out after the passive indexers have been forced to buy in. The perfect example here is Tesla. It was not in the S&P500 despite having a huge market cap because of profitability concerns. When it was announced that Tesla would be included, the price shot up quickly in January, leading passive S&P500 index investors to not only miss out on this performance but overpay when front runners have finished buying. You can see this in VXF, which holds stocks that are NOT in the S&P500, so Tesla was in VXF but not anymore, and SQ is in VXF. During the same period from 2003, VXF went up 660%, excluding dividends, way better than both VTI and VOO, due to both size factor and lack of front running drag.

Edit: I would like to mention though that despite the outperformance of VXF over many years, I would still be careful going all in because small caps tend to have long periods of consolidation and larger corrections with periods of massive booms. After the recent small cap outperformance, I would be careful not to chase performance.",tachyonvelocity,21,/r/stocks/comments/my7371/vti_vs_voo_they_are_almost_the_same/gvtyv6i/,0.064,0.859,0.077,0.8137

Basically, IRC.853 is divided into 6 subsections. Subsection A allows a Regulated Investment Company, such as Vanguard, the option to elect to transfer its Foreign Tax Credit (FTC) to its shareholders rather than to take it on the company's own tax return. However, this election can only be made if 50% of the assets are held in foreign corporations and Vanguard distributes at least 90% of its taxable income to the shareholders. If one of the criteria is not met, Vanguard is required to take the FTC deduction on its own tax return. 

Subsection B is the effect of the election. Naturally, only one taxable entity can take the FTC deduction. Either Vanguard takes the deduction directly and reduces the taxable income that distributes to its shareholders, or it passes the credit to its shareholders and does not take a deduction. 

Subsection C is to let you know that if Vanguard has made the election to pass the FTC along to its shareholders, the company must also provide you with a statement detailing your deduction and you should not report to the IRS a deduction greater than the one reported on this statement.

Subsections D to subsections F are not really applicable to you so I won't spend time on it.

In plain English, Sec.853 is let you know that if Vanguard meets both criteria outlined in subsection A, the Regulated Investment Company has the option to pass along the FTC deduction rather than take it themselves. It does not mean that VT will not give you a FTC deduction because less than 50% of its assets are foreign corporations, but rather, the FTC deduction is already embedded in the distributions made to you. This is kinda what I was thinking in my original post above.

The second link that you posted lets you know which [Vanguard funds qualified](https://advisors.vanguard.com/iwe/pdf/taxcenter/FASFTCWS_012021.pdf) for the Sec.853 election. You will note that VT is not there; but VXUS is. The decision between VT or VTI+VXUS is more of personal preference than taxability issues. Some people will point out that holding VTI+VXUS has a lower expense ratio than VT by itself but I mean....you're talking pennies here for each thousand dollars invested. 

The only benefit of holding VXUS separate, rather than through VT, would be if you had other foreign investments or equities and you wanted to use the FTC credit from Vanguard to offset those investments. This is a little bit more complex and outside my scope since you would need to file Form 1116 with your return. This is more of a tax planning issue for a CPA with International Tax background rather than for Reddit to answer lol.

144,DD," SPAC with an order book of 1.2B, expecting revenue to reach 14.1B by 2024.  That is one hell of a tough hill to climb.

Microfactories are neat and innovative, but because they are micro they cannot vertically integrate fully I am assuming.  This will put some pressure on margins, but they will benefit on margins as well from their in house tech.

I don't see anything particularly innovative about their vehicles, most of their expertise seems to be manufacturing related, but will have to be proven at steady state.  Would be cool to see them team up with a major manufacturer as a provider of manufacturing tech.

I would wait on this one and watch it.  Last mile delivery is a competitive space, buses also.  They need to be able to offer a product with automation features, which seem to be coming from Waymo potentially, who could just as easily partner with their competitors on any fleet tenders.

https://www.autoblog.com/2020/01/29/ups-deliveries-arrival-vans-waymo/

I would need to start see their order book build with other clients, otherwise they might not succeed.  Amazon went with Rivian.  USPS  went with Oshkosh.  

I don't know enough about their product to say why they didn't get those contracts, but I feel like maybe they're missing something... who knows, maybe they've got something in the works.  Lazy me says that a 130kwh battery for their vans that only produces 160km of range is not efficient or leading edge tech, but I didn't dig into the load assumptions, nor the driving conditions used to come up with that figure.

Considering that they're trading for almost 8x their booked revenues and haven't actually produced en masse yet, this is pretty high risk.

Please feel free to correct any of the above.  I am neither long nor short this stock.  If you can tell me why their product is better than their competitors, I will do some further DD.",SecretUsername2000,10,/r/stocks/comments/my22w6/arrival_uk_based_ev_startup_backed_by_ups_thoughts/gvsoajm/,0.069,0.803,0.128,0.9663

147,TSLA, We'll see. A ton of competition.  Financial Times analyst says out of 12 EV SPACS only one that can compete with TSLA is LUCID.

148,TSLA," >Tesla just reported first-quarter vehicle production and delivery numbers for 2021. In total, it delivered 184,800 vehicles and produced 180,338 cars.

>Analysts were expecting Tesla to deliver around 168,000 vehicles during this period, according to estimates compiled by FactSet as of April 1. Estimates ranged from 145,000 to 188,000 deliveries.

So that's pretty good news for TSLA.  Interestingly enough I've recently heard TSLA is now 'cheaper' than Peleton based on analysts forward earnings projections.... but those projections also place the current price of TSLA at what it should be worth in early 2023 (current fair value of ~$435).

That's not to say break-throughs/unexpected can't push that timeline up (or down).  I'm definitely a strong believer in TSLA's future and if you're long there's probably no great harm in investing now, other than potentially sacrificing investment time in the meantime (if this projection is correct).",Karnes,5,/r/stocks/comments/mxyb8e/settled_consumertargeted_battery_electric_vehicle/gvrxsy0/,0.045,0.787,0.168,0.9621

150,ICE," Valuations aside, I do really like Rivian and Lucid as they bring competitive tech to the table.  VW and Renault are getting big sales in Europe, but like the Leaf, their technology isn't at a stage where they become ICE vehicle replacements for road tripping North Americans.

I like Lucid because they had industry leading efficiency numbers, at least until the Model S plaid numbers came out.  We'll see how that plays out, but the numbers are close.  Rawlinson is following the Tesla playbook, and they are years behind potentially being a major player.  The Lucid Air is a really nice car, but limited market.  I'm curious to see what they release next to increase market share and gain more mass market appeal.

Fisker, designs cars people like, but will rely on 3rd party tech.  I like the asset light model, but presales have been discouraging.  Personally, I'm not an SUV person, but also wasn't super impressed with the Ocean.

For crazy reasons, I think the long term EV winner will be Toyota.  Nobody is expecting it, but they are working towards solid state batteries, and I think with their manufacturing expertise, they might be the first to pull it off.  Their CEO is on camera talking about how EVs are a terrible idea because the Japanese grid can't handle it and the upgrades would cost so much money, but in stealth mode, they've been continuing to fund EV tech.

In general, this space feels overhyped like weed stocks did.  There will be some long term winners, but I personally am not invested.

161,QDEL," I’ve been looking into QDEL intently and hope to soon make a full post on my findings.

That being said, what I can say now is that for most of the past 15 years Quidel as a company seemed a bit *meh* when it came to revenue and EPS growth. Looking at a price chart (I use macrotrends.net) we see the stock rangebound for a decade until it first broke out in early 2018. This was no accident; Quidel was finally able to generate impressive YoY revenue growth *and* began to turn a profit because.....the 2017-18 flu season in the U.S. was one of the gnarliest in recent memory.

It’s important as a beginning investor to know what is driving the revenue of the company you’re investing in...for Quidel, it was first the manufacturing of flu tests, and starting last year they were among the first to branch into producing COVID tests en masse. They generated great revenue and profits off of their COVID tests last year, truly unprecedented numbers in their history, and the stock price soared off of these figures. What were the three words most uttered last year if they weren’t “testing, testing, testing”? So while taking a backseat to say, Zoom Video in terms of popularity among investors, nevertheless a robust testing apparatus was as important to the pandemic response as robust remote communications was.

What’s happening with the share price now is twofold...I believe investors are first looking to sell off the companies that most benefitted during the pandemic...think a company like Peloton too along with Zoom and Quidel. The second aspect of QDEL’s decline is that, because of the masking and social distancing protocols we all adhered to this past flu season, well, we didn’t really have a flu season did we? As a result, Quidel had to come out and say their revenue figures would be less than expected because a big moneymaker for them—flu tests—went unneeded this past year. Pair that with the mass rollout of COVID vaccinations, and we could see a *much reduced need* for both COVID and flu tests in the next 12 months. 

While valuations on QDEL are too good to be true at the moment (like P/E of 6 and a P/S of 3, for instance), I would say that it’s important for the stock to have a couple weeks of no further downtrends before deciding to jump in. I personally don’t think flu and COVID tests will be done away with entirely. In fact I think we’ve become a lot more health-conscious over the past 12 months, and more people in the future will look to test for all sorts of infectious diseases before deciding to go to work/school when feeling ill.

TL;DR: Investing in QDEL is basically a decision on whether you think cold/flu/COVID testing will play a big part in our lives in the future. While valuations at the moment are too good to be true, I’d steer clear from investing in the stock until we see some price stability...don’t want to be catching a falling knife!",ChaseDeM,2,/r/stocks/comments/myevk3/quidel_qdel_expectations_for_2021/gvuo6ai/,0.055,0.822,0.123,0.9859

210,AI," AMD barely even competes with NVDA right now. Any discrete or data center GPU growth is just a bonus for them; most of their GPU business right now is in integrated and embedded (think laptops and consoles), along with a Samsung partnership for mobile SoCs.
