9,DEA," Generally, I agree, but there are some places where I think we might see big changes earlier than that.

Specifically, PTSD and substance abuse. These are massive problems, and current treatments are laughably ineffective. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy supported with anti-depressants exploded in popularity overnight because it can actually achieve low-double digit success rates (20-30%) which is SUBSTANTIALLY better than the existing options. Early research shows the same therapy with psychedelics instead of anti-depressants has success rates 2-3x higher (in the 80% range).

That is too big of a difference to ignore, especially considering that the government is the one holding the bag on a lot of these cases since they are people who are either receiving military benefits or are part of the indigent or prison population.

Coupled with the fact that those antidepressants have pretty serious side effects and risks and you can see a pretty clear case where parties with deep pockets and influence can see real benefits to getting some changes through fast.

Unlike with weed, there is a really clear clinical application here that fits right into existing treatments. They don't need to go all the way to recreational legalization here, all they need to do is make a move from DEA schedule 1 to schedule 3 or 4, and a lot of these companies start making money.",UnspecificGravity,5,/r/investing/comments/n93uwi/cnbc_a_psychedelic_drug_boom_in_mental_health/gxmk3rq/,0.086,0.716,0.198,0.9861

19,CBT," I am a licensed clinical neuropsychologist. This is factually wrong.

EDIT: Since I got a lot of comments for this same thing, I am just going to answer it here. There are a lot of people in this sub that don't understand science (but think they do) and also don't understand the obstacles it takes for a treatment to become approved for clinical use. Reaching just this point alone will take a long, long time, and mushrooms aren't close to this at all because they have yet to be thoroughly researched or tested against existing treatments. Once and IF you achieve this, now you need to train a brand new generation of clinicians who are capable of administering mushrooms for treatment of specific disorders (only ones they have been clinically shown to be effective). Then you need people to buy into it. This entire process will take far, far longer than people on this sub think it will take.

Second, his numbers are BS. Mushrooms effectiveness has yet to be tested against traditional forms of treatment for any mental disorders as far as I know. CBT is far more effective for PTSD than 20-30%. Simply taking psychedelic mushrooms and achieving 80%+ effectiveness in treating PTSD is BS and likely based on a study where one group of individuals who suffer from PTSD took mushrooms while another group didn't. This is different than comparing individuals who take mushrooms vs. individuals who receive psychotherapy. Psychotropic medication for PTSD isn't very good because PTSD is a disorder that involves having to processes various types of experiences. For this population, exposure therapy is an example of a treatment that works very well and is far more effective than 20-30% cited by this guy. It takes weeks or months of work to achieve. Taking a mushroom found in the wild won't make you forget or heal from a severe traumatic experience like war, death, or violence.",lviathebunny,18,/r/investing/comments/n93uwi/cnbc_a_psychedelic_drug_boom_in_mental_health/gxmnmt0/,0.094,0.84,0.066,-0.908
20,CVS," I mean, I was diagnosed with a mental illness and the medication absolutely helps me. 


I've done some psycho's in the past and they are definitely eye-opening experiences, but what if the patient has a bad trip? Do they need support after taking the drug?

What if things go wrong? Just like a death in a Tesla car, will this drug receive bad press if it does impact a few people negatively? These are the questions I have regarding biotech in general. 


I am excited to see how this drug and PTSD treatment performs over time. There's so much evidence that it helps, but I think as anyone who wants to invest in a company like this should be cautiously optimistic.


Instead of investing in companies like this, I personally invest in the distributors like CVS. I don't try to hit home runs on new medicine - I just try to find something stable to hedge my bets.

Also you are not arguing in good faith, he clearly said mushrooms in conjunction with CBT. Not just taking mushrooms with no intentions and it fixing your issues. 

""Psychotropic medication for PTSD isn't very good because PTSD is a disorder that involves having to processes various types of experiences. ""

Could you elaborate on that? I am not sure if you are referring to mushrooms or antidepressants as not being helpful here. If mushrooms I will strongly disagree, you can certainly process various types of experience's. 

""Taking a mushroom found in the wild won't make you forget or heal from a severe traumatic experience like war, death, or violence.""

If there is not enough evidence to make the claim it will heal those experiences. You cannot make the exact counter claim, with the same lack of evidence.

26,RE," Approving this thread, but ordinarily this is an advice topic and belongs in the daily advice thread.  However, it has generated some conversation, and controversy, where none really exists.

Leveraged real estate does not outperform unleveraged investment in the S&P.  It doesn't outperform it historically, and we would expect the gap to widen as real estate prices continue to rise.

Here is a [real world comparison](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SS7BdVDymVerxNf2j6hQ4cPgswfYVDHBzDA7ll6Jav4/edit?usp=sharing) based on a real example^(1) provided by one of our real estate enthusiast Redditors. As you'll see, because of compounded returns, the difference leaves little room for debate.

Where the discussion lies is really in where the investor's core competencies and interests lie.

27,HOPE," I agree with your points wholeheartedly. Let me explain why:

Although I do believe in real estate investments, it is definitely very tricky for a non-professional to invest in. 

Much homework needs to be done. I see too many people now just blindly buying real estate because they can finally afford it and that it is a good place to put your money. 

Don't know where you are from but the several places I call home are on average returning about 2-3% per year if you rent out your properties. I wouldn't call those rates spectacular and the down payment makes the barrier to entry high. 

That 2-3% does not include the management fees that need to be paid by you (the owner) and government taxes on the property and other upkeeps and maintenance that needs to be done. 

Many will say to find properties that are cheaper where the barrier to entry is lower but the truth is, cheap real estate is usually cheap for a reason. One can take a risk in an unpopular neighborhood and purchase a property there and rent it out and HOPE that the real estate prices will significantly rise over the coming years. 

But how long will that take? How much of a return are you getting all those years after paying your mortgage payments and all the costs associated with the property? As you also mentioned, dealing with bad tenants and legal matters are also factors that need to be factored in. 

I have seen many friends purchase real estate in unpopular neighborhoods because it was cheap and they could afford it or because they thought it was a good place to park their money in  the ""up and coming"" neighborhoods only to see that it has not gone up in value for the past X amount of years. 

Those years they still had to pay management fees, government taxes, maintenance and upkeep, agents to look after the property, and many more fees. Some even could not find a tenant as the neighborhood did not boom after all and even if they could find a tenant, the rental income was perhaps not even enough to cover their mortgage/all the fees mentioned above. 

In my opinion, real estate is good if you can afford to purchase in a major booming city center (popular neighborhoods) where historically prices have been appreciating year after year OR you have quite a bit of EXTRA money lying around and can afford to take a risk in an unpopular neighborhood. 

But I do believe that owning your own home (even if it is a small place in an unpopular neighborhood) is something that should be achieved BEFORE investing your money into stocks or other things. 

As owning your own home will not just give you benefits of not needing to pay rent (in which you are just helping the owner mortgage his/her place), it will also give you much less stress and peace of mind, both of which are critical when working towards your goal or making investment decisions. 

When you do not have to worry about paying rent each month, your head will be much more clear and your spirits much higher. Owning your own home will also give you much more confidence. Do not bother with people saying that owning your own home is a liability, in investment language it most definitely is. But the truth is that having a roof over one's head is a basic human necessity, either you own it or you rent it, both are liabilities. Better to own it. 

&#x200B;

Stocks on the other hand are very liquid and can all be managed via a laptop or phone (one click and you can liquidate all of your holdings, even if you lose money at least you can get back something immediately). 

Where I am from, there are some blue-chip stocks that have dividends of about 7-9% per year which is significantly better than the 2-3% mentioned earlier without all the headaches of owning properties. 

Where I am from, one can also finance your stocks. Meaning that one pays each month (like a mortgage) to own stocks in companies that one likes. 

One can just look at the past year (when the pandemic started) to now. Most stocks, would have doubled or tripled one's investment.  

Of course the downside for stocks is that a financial crisis could happen at any moment and that one's holdings will significantly decrease in value. But in my opinion even if that were the case, unless the company completely shuts down (which is rare but not impossible), one can just hold for long term and the gains will definitely come back just like after every financial crisis.   
Also, one can just take a look at charts of the major indexes and see that the trend is always up, even if there is a significant crash, it always pulls back up more than before the crash happened. That should give any long term investor confidence in the markets. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Another good investment will be in precious metals, I mean actually owning the metal physically or a certificate that can be traded in for cash at any large institution at anytime. 

One can also just take a look at the chart of gold and also see that it has been steadily increasing over the past decades. Although there were major crashes, it has always rallied back up to that point and further. 

Gold has been the standard form of investment for mankind for thousands of years. From what I see in the past, I believe it will remain so for the foreseeable future. It is also VERY liquid and can be exchanged anywhere in the world for instant cash. 

It is a very good way to store and park your money, perhaps beating inflation even if no major bear market for gold occurs. One can either purchase gold certificates from a bank or just purchase little 99.99 gold 1 oz bars and store in a safe at home or safety deposit box in your bank and just hold on for long term. Even if it does not go up in value (which it most likely will if you hold on for long term 10+ years) at least you can liquidate at anytime and it is a good place to park your money knowing that gold is safe, it will ALWAYS be worth something. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Another thing I would recommend is always to diversify your investments. Some in stocks and some in other things. Another thing I would recommend to invest in is in art. 

It may sound silly to some but art/antiques are perhaps one of the best and safest investments of all time. One can just look at Van Gogh and Picasso paintings (two of many examples of great artists) and see what type of astronomical returns it has given owners in the past decades. 

Of course normal folk like us cannot afford to buy a Van Gogh or Picasso piece or a Michelangelo sculpture, although if I could I certainly would as these pieces will NEVER drop in value as they are priceless. 

That is why I would recommend to collect newer artists that do not have much fame yet. Go around town and look at some art galleries and check out what you like. I have had many friends who did just that and purchased some paintings at around $100 and was only told several years later that the artist's work is now worth $3000. 

Of course not every artist will become famous or go up in value, therefore homework also needs to be done as in every investing hobby. But art rarely tends to drop in value even if it does not go up. And as a bonus, even if it does not go up at least you can hang them up on your wall as decor. After all, you did purchase the piece that YOU liked to begin with. 

There are many forms of investment one could potentially dabble into. Real estate is definitely one of them and I am not saying that it is not good. It is just not easy to be able to be consistently profitable in the real estate market unless your pockets are deep or if one has extra money lying around. 

If I did not have much extra capital lying around I would rather look elsewhere such as stocks, arts/antiques, precious metals. 

This is not financial advice, just my 2 cents in sharing with you all. I know this is a real estate group and I do not mean to undermine anyone, just friendly and open discussion.

One can either purchase gold certificates from a bank or just purchase little 99.99 gold 1 oz bars and store in a safe at home or safety deposit box in your bank and just hold on for long term. Even if it does not go up in value (which it most likely will if you hold on for long term 10+ years) at least you can liquidate at anytime and it is a good place to park your money knowing that gold is safe, it will ALWAYS be worth something. 

&#x200B;

Another thing I would recommend is always to diversify your investments. Some in stocks and some in other things. Another thing I would recommend to invest in is in art. 

It may sound silly to some but art/antiques are perhaps one of the best and safest investments of all time. One can just look at Van Gogh and Picasso paintings (two of many examples of great artists) and see what type of astronomical returns it has given owners in the past decades. 

Of course normal folk like us cannot afford to buy a Van Gogh or Picasso piece or a Michelangelo sculpture, although if I could I certainly would as these pieces will NEVER drop in value as they are priceless. 

That is why I would recommend to collect newer artists that do not have much fame yet. Go around town and look at some art galleries and check out what you like. I have had many friends who did just that and purchased some paintings at around $100 and was only told several years later that the artist's work is now worth $3000. 

Of course not every artist will become famous or go up in value, therefore homework also needs to be done as in every investing hobby. But art rarely tends to drop in value even if it does not go up. And as a bonus, even if it does not go up at least you can hang them up on your wall as decor. After all, you did purchase the piece that YOU liked to begin with. 

There are many forms of investment one could potentially dabble into. Real estate is definitely one of them and I am not saying that it is not good. It is just not easy to be able to be consistently profitable in the real estate market unless your pockets are deep or if one has extra money lying around. 

If I did not have much extra capital lying around I would rather look elsewhere such as stocks, arts/antiques, precious metals. 

This is not financial advice, just my 2 cents in sharing with you all. I know this is a real estate group and I do not mean to undermine anyone, just friendly and open discussion.

29,VERY," I agree with your points wholeheartedly. Let me explain why:

Although I do believe in real estate investments, it is definitely very tricky for a non-professional to invest in. 

Much homework needs to be done. I see too many people now just blindly buying real estate because they can finally afford it and that it is a good place to put your money. 

Don't know where you are from but the several places I call home are on average returning about 2-3% per year if you rent out your properties. I wouldn't call those rates spectacular and the down payment makes the barrier to entry high. 

That 2-3% does not include the management fees that need to be paid by you (the owner) and government taxes on the property and other upkeeps and maintenance that needs to be done. 

Many will say to find properties that are cheaper where the barrier to entry is lower but the truth is, cheap real estate is usually cheap for a reason. One can take a risk in an unpopular neighborhood and purchase a property there and rent it out and HOPE that the real estate prices will significantly rise over the coming years. 

But how long will that take? How much of a return are you getting all those years after paying your mortgage payments and all the costs associated with the property? As you also mentioned, dealing with bad tenants and legal matters are also factors that need to be factored in. 

I have seen many friends purchase real estate in unpopular neighborhoods because it was cheap and they could afford it or because they thought it was a good place to park their money in  the ""up and coming"" neighborhoods only to see that it has not gone up in value for the past X amount of years. 

Those years they still had to pay management fees, government taxes, maintenance and upkeep, agents to look after the property, and many more fees. Some even could not find a tenant as the neighborhood did not boom after all and even if they could find a tenant, the rental income was perhaps not even enough to cover their mortgage/all the fees mentioned above. 

In my opinion, real estate is good if you can afford to purchase in a major booming city center (popular neighborhoods) where historically prices have been appreciating year after year OR you have quite a bit of EXTRA money lying around and can afford to take a risk in an unpopular neighborhood. 

But I do believe that owning your own home (even if it is a small place in an unpopular neighborhood) is something that should be achieved BEFORE investing your money into stocks or other things. 

As owning your own home will not just give you benefits of not needing to pay rent (in which you are just helping the owner mortgage his/her place), it will also give you much less stress and peace of mind, both of which are critical when working towards your goal or making investment decisions. 

When you do not have to worry about paying rent each month, your head will be much more clear and your spirits much higher. Owning your own home will also give you much more confidence. Do not bother with people saying that owning your own home is a liability, in investment language it most definitely is. But the truth is that having a roof over one's head is a basic human necessity, either you own it or you rent it, both are liabilities. Better to own it. 

&#x200B;

Stocks on the other hand are very liquid and can all be managed via a laptop or phone (one click and you can liquidate all of your holdings, even if you lose money at least you can get back something immediately). 

Where I am from, there are some blue-chip stocks that have dividends of about 7-9% per year which is significantly better than the 2-3% mentioned earlier without all the headaches of owning properties. 

Where I am from, one can also finance your stocks. Meaning that one pays each month (like a mortgage) to own stocks in companies that one likes. 

One can just look at the past year (when the pandemic started) to now. Most stocks, would have doubled or tripled one's investment.  

Of course the downside for stocks is that a financial crisis could happen at any moment and that one's holdings will significantly decrease in value. But in my opinion even if that were the case, unless the company completely shuts down (which is rare but not impossible), one can just hold for long term and the gains will definitely come back just like after every financial crisis.   
Also, one can just take a look at charts of the major indexes and see that the trend is always up, even if there is a significant crash, it always pulls back up more than before the crash happened. That should give any long term investor confidence in the markets. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Another good investment will be in precious metals, I mean actually owning the metal physically or a certificate that can be traded in for cash at any large institution at anytime. 

One can also just take a look at the chart of gold and also see that it has been steadily increasing over the past decades. Although there were major crashes, it has always rallied back up to that point and further. 

Gold has been the standard form of investment for mankind for thousands of years. From what I see in the past, I believe it will remain so for the foreseeable future. It is also VERY liquid and can be exchanged anywhere in the world for instant cash. 

It is a very good way to store and park your money, perhaps beating inflation even if no major bear market for gold occurs. One can either purchase gold certificates from a bank or just purchase little 99.99 gold 1 oz bars and store in a safe at home or safety deposit box in your bank and just hold on for long term. Even if it does not go up in value (which it most likely will if you hold on for long term 10+ years) at least you can liquidate at anytime and it is a good place to park your money knowing that gold is safe, it will ALWAYS be worth something.

31,RE," Edit: sorry, first paragraph here was in response to a comment down the chain about people paying cash for RE now—-it reads weird bc I put my novella here in the wrong spot. Whoops. 

A lot of them are winning contracts by promising cash (borrowing from relatives or using retirement savings, etc...) and then quickly financing immediately after. The borrowing is still happening—it’s not like all of a sudden first time home buyers have started pulling hundreds of thousands out of thin air. People moving up the next rung might have profited enough from their first home and the robust market to pay cash, but my guess is that most are financing as soon as the closing ink is dry. It’s too inexpensive to borrow. They would be silly not to...

I’m a small time real estate investor from a real estate investment family and we’re selling or holding properties, not buying or thinking of buying RE right now...at least not on the residential side. Market is too hot.  Materials too expensive. And we typically NEVER sell. Even my grandparents that have held through all kinds of insane markets are selling a couple of their least attractive properties as renters move out or move on. Dumping them easily.  Same with my parents. I’m the only idiot hanging on to my portfolio bc I like my tenants and worry about where the hell they would go in this market. Long term so they are paying much, much lower than what I could/would charge new tenants. 

Commercial real estate prices are pretty competitive, and if the right location(s) become available, we’ll put bids in on those. Sort of holding potential investment money in more liquid forms to be ready in the event the residential house of cards collapses any time soon. 

Money is currently in crypto, (ponzi? Hope not, time will tell) stonks, except so many companies are overvalued, I’m wondering when we should just pull the plug of some of those holdings in order to preserve value before the correction. Inflation is going to get crazy. The gravy train is going to stop. People are going to have to start working again and it’s not going to be a smooth transition. There’s no back to “on” light switch. 

There’s also a lot of concerning fraud with commercial valuations and leases that has recently come to light (dollar tree comes to mind, but I might be Mis-remembering—maybe it’s dollar general? Or something else entirely. It’s late, sorry)...so if what’s in the dark is brought into the light....it could get ugly.  And those fabricated figures and preferential treatment for leases could hit the company stocks like dominoes in addition to wiping out countless corporate leases. 

I’ve been in real estate for 20+ years and I mistakenly thought we were due for a residential real estate correction well before now. So...what do I know?

FHA loans and changing from paying rent to investing in a long-term property investment are very different things.

Also, in many cases you can invest in property (even a second home) and properly utilize credit for a profitable rental (i.e. your rent income is greater than the mortgage payment).

IT is not really an apples to apples comparison as a mortgage on a second property can be attained for seriously low-interest rates, maintain a revenue stream, and provide long term income as well as investment growth.

39,RE," You are missing some of the biggest components of RE investing, mainly that being leverage as well as someone else buying your equity for you. You say you will be hardpressed to find a RE investment that has doubled in 5-10 years. Mine has 4x ROI in 18 months, with a floor that is much safer. Find me a stock investment that can return that much with less downside.

&#x200B;

The point of RE is that you buy an asset with other peoples (the bank) money, then have other people (the tenets) pay it back. You get money on appreciation, the new equity, and any monthly cash flow. Because of being leveraged this is a multiplier on your returns (but also greater risk).

&#x200B;

Yes it's very illiquid, not diverse, has hidden costs (repairs, maintenance) but in many ways is low risk as people will always need somewhere to live.

46,TV," Lol... they deleted their comment.. leaving my response up:

This is a ridiculous argument as not all real estate investors pay these fees in full as advertised by that calculator.  I bought one of my homes for $343k with a 30 year mortgage,  paid it off in three years using my other houses investment income, resulting in ~$17k in interest + origination fees and agent costs. Ended up paying around ~$40k on fees and costs total. 3 years later,  it's paid off,  its market value is $530k and I can start renting it for pure profit around $2300 per month or cash in and start again. Which stock do you own that guarantees a 7% gain annually that grows in addition to a 37% dividend after a 3 year period? Let's Factor in 16% for capital gains and make it 6% gain annually. I'm still not seeing how this is a investment not worth making when ViacomCBS can half in a day and struggle to come back 1% months later.  Think that is a crappy example? Let's poke the radio shack or sun TV examples to find a decent comparison.  Don't forget that your broker and management firms are always making money off of you,  even when you are losing value.  Even the free commission unethical vampires are getting paid to sell order flow while Robbing the hood and helping to cause retail investors significant loses in revenue. Paying down a mortgage allows you to pay them less and walk away with more value until you can stop paying them at all and continue to build value.

55,IMO," I listed exactly what you asked for. Different person than you were going back and forth with so maybe you’re confused?

My cost basis is my cash out of pocket to purchase the property which was $39k total. Cash on cash return is really what I focus on and for the most part it’s almost tax free. I don’t count the equity/mortgage pay down as that’s icing on the cake. I don’t consider appreciation at all as that’s pure speculation IMO. 

My net monthly rental income ($1020) is minus maintenance and management fees, it was one of my lower months. Rent is $1300/mo. 

My monthly mortgage payment ($677) includes taxes and insurance. Here is a breakdown of the monthly payment: $136.47 principal, $362.81 interest, $177.93 escrow.

$1020 - $677 = $343/month cash flow 

Not sure how you can factor in taxes but obviously I get to deduct all expenses: management fees, maintenance, mortgage interest, depreciation, etc.

Not sure your last comment. These are my actual numbers from my payout this month which was worse than usual due to slightly higher expenses. 

What other info do you need?

If I’m calculating correctly, ignoring the equity, I’m making ~10% on cash flow which is almost tax free, totally tax free last year, this year I had to pay a little due to not having to make the mortgage payment for a few months.

* Their competition (taxis) are already dead. Not the case with DASH with the 9999 new VC backed food delivery apps offering -50% off meals, NFLX with everyone trying to get a bite of their pie, or TSLA with the autos throwing down the gauntlet.

* Market duopoly means they have the leverage and power to raise prices and pressure labor in the future. Post-expansion phase.

* Travel will reopen. Business will boom. Employees will see more benefits. Government benefits will dwindle. Jobs will return. 

* Costs will ALWAYS go up with expansion and operations growth. That is how companies do business. Motley Fool would be killing a company as ""X's costs too low! possibly fraud?!??!"" click bait if there was a company that didn't have correlating cost growth.

>[Motley Fool] Current model for **[ANY TECH COMPANY HERE]** just doesn't work. Expenses have scaled up in near-perfect step with revenue, as have net losses. As it stands now, both EBITDA improvement outlooks are tough to believe.

>What's changing? For the record, the analyst community isn't fazed by the losses so far, apparently convinced that **[ANY TECH INDUSTRY HERE]** are on the cusp of fiscal breakthroughs. Current estimates imply **[ANY TECH COMPANY HERE]** will cut its operating losses by more than half this year, and do the same again in 2022. 

>Those same analysts are predicting **[ANY TECH COMPANY HERE]** will swing to operating profitability next year. Investors are (for the most part) buying into this bullishness.

>The graphics below put things in perspective, starting with **[ANY TECH COMPANY HERE]**. Notice how, thus far, the company's cost of revenue has consumed 45% to 50% of revenue. Analysts believe these costs will fall toward 40% of sales in the foreseeable future, when marketing spending is expected to slide well below 30% of revenue.

>**[ANY TECH COMPANY HERE]** profitability is projected to widen soon, but the company's not explained how its ~~driver~~ **[EMPLOYEE]** costs are going to be curbed.

>Bottom line **[ANY TECH COMPANY HERE]** can continue to scale up, but to what end? Both have already been scaling up for some time. Expenses have merely scaled up in near-perfect step with revenue, as have net losses. 

>Investors may want to start asking for specifics about each company's cost-reduction plans, and then decide whether or not they're plausible. As it stands now, both EBITDA improvement outlooks are tough to believe.

Pretty lazy if you ask me. You can literally write the same article by replacing the companies with AAPL/MSFT half a century ago, AMZN/FB/GOOG from decades ago, SNAP/TWTR/BAT/NFLX a few years ago, or TSLA/ABNB now.

Both companies will be fine. 

* Their competition (taxis) are already dead. Not the case with DASH with the 9999 new VC backed food delivery apps offering -50% off meals, NFLX with everyone trying to get a bite of their pie, or TSLA with the autos throwing down the gauntlet.

* Market duopoly means they have the leverage and power to raise prices and pressure labor in the future. Post-expansion phase.

* Travel will reopen. Business will boom. Employees will see more benefits. Government benefits will dwindle. Jobs will return. 

* Costs will ALWAYS go up with expansion and operations growth. That is how companies do business. Motley Fool would be killing a company as ""X's costs too low! possibly fraud?!??!"" click bait if there was a company that didn't have correlating cost growth.

* Tech companies in particular are NOTORIOUS for running cost to the point of 0 profits for DECADES to avoid paying taxes. Apple, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Facebook literally still do that TODAY when they are the biggest and most dominant companies in the world. These same analyst folks would say UBER/LYFT are poorly managed and declining companies in a dying industry if they weren't posting rapid growth running on 0 profits.

Selling IP to yourself is ridiculously cheap, but in our environment debt is even cheaper.

76,ETH," >In todays world, bitcoin is the most favorable risk vs reward ratio out of all of them... people here will try to tell you otherwise, but this is just a fact... i am not saying crypto and shitcoins, only bitcoin...

Not sure what 'most favorable risk vs reward' scenario means.  If you're saying you can make the highest return on the least investment you might be right, but finding the right project startup to invest in (and getting it right) is going to be necessary for that 10,000% increase over the next decade.

That said, I think ETH is the way to go for the next 5-10 years over Bitcoin.  As the 2nd most popular coin it is already available on a lot of exchanges, the 2.0 rollout allows a lot more transactions, and it is being used as the base blockchain for most of the NFT trading that's happening now.  Bitcoin was essentially a proof of concept for crypto but the price is driven mostly by scarcity now.  Any new use-cases for bitcoin will probably also be accepting Etherium.

Also, just don't put all your investments into one place.  People will warn you that crypto is a trap, and they are somewhat right: you very well may get burned.  But the volatility means that your investments can be way up as well as way down.  Just remember that you might be getting in at the top of a wave and need to wait for the next set to profit - stay invested.",Enchiguap,2,/r/investing/comments/n90hkk/market_valuations_and_investing_allocations/gxlo5ww/,0.042,0.824,0.133,0.9802
77,IMO," Betting on the big defense primes in times of inflation is not a good bet.  As inflation rises, interest rates will rise, which will absolutely demolish government spending.  The only thing that can raise the big primes stock price is overall defense budget increases, which is extremely unlikely any time in the next 10-20 years.  So IMO big defense primes are dead money at best.

I question whether “Capitalist Europe” exists.  Have you seen what companies in Europe have to do to hire and fire new employees or expand their facilities?  Yeah, no thanks.  Awful business environment.

Yes diversity and inclusion policies are a drag on growth because it means companies aren’t hiring the most capable people for key roles.  But this is basically just a transfer of wealth to smaller companies startups, and venture capital.  At some level of size D&I doesn’t do anything.  And there is a new wave of startups that are becoming apolitical like Coinbase which may also counterbalance this over time.  Trends in corporate governance come and go and rarely drive business cycles.

In times of inflation the best places to put your money are in certain “hot” commodities and emerging markets.  But personally I am not buying the inflation hype over the long term.

99,IMO," You are giving yourself anxiety over this where there should be absolutely no reason to do so. 

First off, why is your horizon so short? Only 10-15 years? I get you’re not investing for retirement but don’t you think you should at least consider IRA accounts, especially a Roth if you qualify? That’s tax-free (Roth) income in addition to pension and social security. 

Second, we are almost always in a bubble. I hear that term constantly. Yes, tech is at high multiples but, IMO, that’s justified given technology is such a significant factor of the economy. 

Third, you’re right, you can’t time the market. So don’t attempt to. Allocate capital overtime. Every time you get paid, invest a small amount. Do that consistently and it won’t matter if we are in a bubble or not. You will ride the highs and lows if you consistently buy. 

“If I began investing before the dot com bubble...” Yes but that’s not assuming you keep consistently investing during those two decades... Some of the wealthiest people right now are those that entered the job market in 05/06 and kept their job through the crisis while maintaining a commitment to consistently invest. They enjoyed one of the greatest bull runs in history.",ThrowawayFiDiGuy,10,/r/investing/comments/n98sow/investing_during_a_potential_bubble/gxmhc92/,0.047,0.792,0.161,0.9805

102,GE," I do the same when I get scared.  Buy big, blue chip names with strong brand (McDonald’s, Disney, etc) that I know will survive to the other side of a bubble in some capacity.

When you see the data-vis charts of the SP500 and it’s 1/3 taken up by giant software companies...it’s concerning that there isn’t more diversity.  Like, I get it, tech is a big part of our world and controls huge revenues.  But that could have been said about many sectors at many times who all saw their influence wane over time.  

Like in 2001, the top 5 companies were GE, Microsoft, Exxon, Citi, and Walmart.  Right there, if you only owned the top 5 companies, they are spread across different sectors with different risks, so you have diversity.  

Now it’s Apple, Microsoft, Google, Facebook, and Amazon.  It’s not “that” different than 2001, but two of the companies do the same thing nearly(Google and FB), and the profitable part of Amazon does the same thing as Microsoft.  And Microsoft also sort of does the same thing as Apple...etc.

Anyways, food for thought about different bubbles. It’s not so much if things are inflated, just making sure you don’t get caught too concentrated.

For example, all the “woe is me” reaction to the market today, suggest that it’s crashing.  Meanwhile, it’s just the big dogs of tech.

>DraftKings (DKNG) came out with a quarterly loss of $0.87 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $0.51. This compares to loss of $0.18 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.

Is it a speculative play, betting that they're leading the way in a growth industry?  I guess I can see that, but just seems to me that when a company is hemorrhaging money and disappointing the street for this long, it's not surprising they're going to have a difficult time sustaining growth in stock price forever.

199,RH," It's my understanding that there are a bunch of things to consider. This is not financial advice, only what I have read on the internet, so it could be bs, or it could be based in fact.

For starters, Matt Kohrs, youTube sensation said that sometimes when you put in a limit sell or limit buy, if a whale dumps like millions of shares, it could literally bypass your limit. Like, say your limit sell is 30, and the price is 50. If a whale dumps, it could go from 50 to 10 instantly and not step down a ladder. This means your sell then would hit at 10, and you would get fucked. I have seen this happen only once to me on Robinhood, and they were pretty close to the actual number, so I didn't really mind. 

The second part of this, is that HF's set a swing range themselves. You will often see a +/- 1% or something on a stock. It's an algorithim they have that sets it, so based on the price point, they have it worked out so they can safely make profits. You, on the other hand, pay commissions in some form. In Robinhood, for instance, when you buy, you always buy way above the current price, and when you sell, you sell way below the current price, and they get the vig or vigorish, and that's their comission. So if you have a stock at 30, and you instantly sold and rebought, you would lose. You would sell at 29.5 and buy at 31.5 for a net loss of a single share. That's their comission. Now because of the fact you have to pay this, when you set your own buy and sell limits you have to cover this, so your buy/sell range is going to be slightly larger than what the HF is having, this means that the HF's will have +/- 1% and you have to be +/- 1.5% making it really really hard for you to make money swing trading. It can be done, as you can certainly set larger limits like 5% but then you have to wait for weeks/months for it to swing that way. 

THe other thing to consider, is the shady volume generator they use. For instance, Say the stock is 30, and you have a buy order at 50. The exchange and HF's know because they can see this. They have an order flow view, and because they can see it, if they want the volume for the trade comission, they can pump/dump really fast to get your 50. So they rocket it right up to 50, you buy in, and then it dumps back to 30. They get their comission, and you got fucked. So then you do what most paper handed people do, and that's sell. The moment you sell, they made 20 off you in about 8 seconds. 

Lastly, and this is a big one over at wall street bets. When you buy on RH, you have a margin account. Let's say you buy in with 1M dollars. You buy say, TSLA. Now, you don't own those shares, they are hypothetical shares. But RH can now SHORT Tsla with YOUR MONEY which does two things: the first is they can short and rebuy making profit on your money, and two, if you sell for less, they get that money too. Basically they fucked you twice. You gave them money to intentionally short and fuck you as a loan. 

So, the only real play is do your due dilligence, buy, and hold for a minimum of 6 months unless it moons and then sell and take profit. Like if it moons in a week, sell that shit and take profit.

200,TSLA," It's my understanding that there are a bunch of things to consider. This is not financial advice, only what I have read on the internet, so it could be bs, or it could be based in fact.

For starters, Matt Kohrs, youTube sensation said that sometimes when you put in a limit sell or limit buy, if a whale dumps like millions of shares, it could literally bypass your limit. Like, say your limit sell is 30, and the price is 50. If a whale dumps, it could go from 50 to 10 instantly and not step down a ladder. This means your sell then would hit at 10, and you would get fucked. I have seen this happen only once to me on Robinhood, and they were pretty close to the actual number, so I didn't really mind. 

The second part of this, is that HF's set a swing range themselves. You will often see a +/- 1% or something on a stock. It's an algorithim they have that sets it, so based on the price point, they have it worked out so they can safely make profits. You, on the other hand, pay commissions in some form. In Robinhood, for instance, when you buy, you always buy way above the current price, and when you sell, you sell way below the current price, and they get the vig or vigorish, and that's their comission. So if you have a stock at 30, and you instantly sold and rebought, you would lose. You would sell at 29.5 and buy at 31.5 for a net loss of a single share. That's their comission.

201,OR," One more little tidbit:

IF you sell your newly shares shortly after the company buys them on your behalf, AND the stock price isn't too volatile, THEN the capital gain is minimal, and it don't much matter if you're paying normal rates or cap gains rates.  If there are any small fees or commissions on either the purchase or the sale, you might even be able to sell at a slight loss, and have even fewer cap gains taxes to pay.

With this approach, selling the day of the purchase, you are clearly NOT interested in -any- kind of cap gain OR loss; you are merely ""harvesting"" the company contribution.

206,IRS," In this situation - it really doesn't matter because the net profit/loss is what the IRS cares about. The wash sale tax rule was really meant to keep someone from artificially harvesting a tax loss. 

In your example - let's assume that each tax lot is 1 share. The avg cost basis is $75. So when you sell all the shares, the taxable gain is $10 or $5/share.

So in this example:

1. Buy 1 share of $100 of stock A
2. Sell 1 share of stock at $75, 5 days later
3. Buy 1 share of stock A at $50, 5 days later
4. Sell 1 share of stock A at $80

The first sale is a wash sale so the $25 loss isn't deducted. But you can add the $25 to the cost-basis of the $50 purchase so your cost basis on the new share is $75. When you sell for $80, the taxable gain is $5. 

Wash sales really aren't that scary. 

If you want to read more about the nuances - please look at the Wash Sales section of IRS Pub 550 - which you can find here - [https://www.irs.gov/publications/p550#en\_US\_2020\_publink100010601](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p550#en_US_2020_publink100010601)",greytoc,2,/r/investing/comments/n8zxcu/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gxmpn65/,0.023,0.826,0.151,0.9681
207,TLRY," The deeper ITM you go the more likely it is that your option will be profitable. So because it is more likely that your option will be profitable it means that the option will track changes in stock price more closely.

As you get closer to ATM or OTM options, the less likely your bet is that you'll be profitable, so the delta is going to be lower because there is still *time* for your option to be less profitable or not profitable at all.

Let's say TLRY goes from $15 to $25. Well, that $15 strike is now more likely to be profitable so the delta is going to now increase and start tracking the movements in TLRY closer because your option is becoming a better/stronger bet. The ""stronger"" your bet is the more likely your return is. So let's say the price keeps going up to $35, now your bet is even stronger, and your option changes are going to track the changes in the underlying more closely.

Let's say you buy an option ATM that is 100 days away from expiring. Later in the day the underlying stock goes up $1. The reason you aren't going to get that $1 return immediately on your option is because there are still 99 days to go for that underlying stock to go down $1 and because you're closer to ATM your bet here is weaker, so the changes of the option will be less drastic.

Now, let's say you buy a really deep ITM option that is 100 days away from expiring. Later in the day the underlying stock goes up $1. Because your option is so deep ITM it is almost considered you already own that stock so you'll see closer to that $1 return immediately.",ImActuallyUseless,1,/r/investing/comments/n8zxcu/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gxmh7m3/,0.021,0.902,0.077,0.9501

Innovation isn't a focus in any of my points.

>assume as a US person,

Canada, but we're basically the 51st state.

>all other countries are becoming more and more strict on gun control,

The places that are implementing greater gun control either already have small retail markets (like Canada) or have had strong gun control for decades (Europe). On the contrary, massive, growing markets in South America, SE Asia, some places in Africa, and the Middle East are rising steadily, especially Brazil and the Middle East.

>War and governments drives weapons manufacturing growth

[A vast majority (85%) of firearms are owned by civilians worldwide](http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/about-us/highlights/2018/highlight-bp-firearms-holdings.html)

That said, a large portion of that is resale, which is why gunmakers don't make $10bln+ annually.

So the new sales segment is probably split either evenly or a few percentage points either way.

As for military demand, I believe that will increase as well as poorer militaries become better equipped, PMCs rise in popularity, geopolitical tensions continue to escalate, etc.

227,SE," Yes you make some good counter points.

But...

Innovation is important to the long term viability of a company, take Colt, it used to be THE gun manufacturing. But they sat on their laurels and stopped innovating, coupled with rising costs and competition, it is a shadow of its former self, having undergone several bankruptcies and changes in management, not a good sign for an investment. If you take out innovation, it's just operating at the mercy of the government and market.

As for the countries you mentioned, well, those are where the demand would be, where the people have the most disposable income to use on a luxury, in SE Asia, middle east, and Africa, surplus firearms are cheap and plentiful, people are less likely to spend discretionary income on new guns. Not to mention super strict gun laws, so consumer access will be very limited. have you also accounted for gun import laws in these markets?

Not to mention ITAR regulations, since we are talking about US companies. It is unlikely that current third world countries will do business with US companies. US may export more weapons than anyone else, but these are high dollar amount items, like jets, missiles, and etc (aerospace and defense contractors are a better bet) If we're talking small arms, China and Russia takes the cake.

As for that statistics you provided, could there be another explanation? Perhaps because there are simply more civilians than there are soldiers? Have you compared non gun owning civilians vs gun owning civilians? The fact that the majority of guns are in civilian hands doesn't mean much by itself. If you mention resales, yes, then that money is not going to the manufacturer.

Yours is not the first gun stock post, but there is a lot of posts like this since the pandemic started. I think you saw ammo, guns, and reloading material fly off the shelves and thought gun stocks must be doing great. but they were affected just like any other manufacturing.

232,IMO," Bridgewater put out a note that they view 15% of the market as highly overvalued, and the remainder they view as mostly fairly valued. They also seem to be moving into defensive & healthcare(ie stuff like Pepsi, Abbott). IMO that's the best way to think about things right now. Note those folks did terrible last year..underperforming S&P by a mile, but I wouldn't discount them for that. Their primary directive is to preserve the wealth of their already wealthy clients.

233,AMD," You buy stocks that have long-term prospects. Some stocks such as AMD grew very quickly, were overvalued and then produced financials that support the stock price.

In the last year AMD went from a PE of 250 to 32, and its guiding for 50% y/y growth. 

You just need to look for the deals.

This stock is a buy.",CosmoPhD,5,/r/investing/comments/n9allg/the_covid_bubble_bursts_now/gxmps1t/,0.0,0.878,0.122,0.7579
