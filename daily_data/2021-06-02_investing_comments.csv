They are audited. Then there are algorithmic decentralized stablecoins like Dai, which are overcollateralized by ETH and transparently auditable on the public Ethereum blockchain. There are dozens of other algorithmic decentralized stablecoins out there that just went through a huge vol shock over the last few weeks as crypto assets lost about 40% of their market cap in aggregate.

Cryptos on the other hand still have an extremely volatile relationship to currency, and what could buy 100 dinners today might buy anywhere from 0 to 2000 if sold a year from now.

13,BSPE," I'm liking Duckhorn (NAPA).  The wine industry is a $45B a year industry and as of now Duckhorn is the only publicly traded wine company.  They have a great product with recognizable brands.  They sell both affordable and luxury wines; and they don't make anything bad though that is subjective.  NAPA turns a profit and they are currently up 25% from IPO but because of this a slight pullback is anticipated.  Overall they are crushing it.

 Also, while not an IPO I am interested in the SPAC merger between VWE (vintage wine estates) and BSPE (Bespoke Capital Aquisition).  As only the second wine company to go public I think this could be a great opportunity.  They are already a profitable company at 9.6 mil per year on a Revenue generation of 190 mil last year. VWE has recognizable brands with 32 listed on their website.  With the upcoming merger it should leave them with cash (\~440mil) to pay down debt and make acquistions streamlining their supply chain and consolodating the industry.  It also should be noted that shareholders have agreed to an 18 month lockup after the merger, signaling great faith by insiders considering most lockup periods are 2-6 months. 

TL;DR: Wine is big money and people love it.  As the only two (potentially) public wine companies at the moment I see great things for NAPA and VWE/BSPE assuming the merger goes as planned.

16,BEST," Norwegian startup FLYR AS 

Ihave posted I few times on it, but there is fast flow of new incoming info from the company, but also in air travel reopening in Europe and in Norway.

I little info on newest airline starter FLYR AS Norway 

Some say it’s the worst of times, others say it’s the best of times. 


My PERSONAL opinion is that, it’s the BEST of times

Why? Because it’s not like that countries and people will be looked forever. The population has not decreased, a drone airlines has not been suddenly invented. So of course people will soon be traveling again . And maybe more than EVER. Because I think that the appetite for travel will be immense in the coming months and years.


Here comes FLYR AS. This new starter , I believe has huge potential.

The potential and catalysts 



1. FLYR AS board members are former Norwegian people.

Tonje Wikstroem Frislid, a former Norwegian Air executive.

Brede Huser, former director Norwegian Reward

Thomas Ramdahl, former commercial director Norwegian

Asgeir Nyseth, former operations director Norwegian

Alf Sagen, has long experience in Norwegian 

Bjørn Erik Barman-Jenssen, former chief for ground services and cargo in Norwegian

Tord Meling, has experience from Deloitte and many years in Norwegian, as a chief for airplanes financing. 

2. FLYR unlike NAS and SAS are DEBT FREE, and have raised lots of cash.

I'm not saying it can't be done, but if you dismiss Stripe by referring to crypto then I think you misunderstand their value proposition. I'm a programmer and I so far have personally witnessed multiple projects where people outside or inside the industry tried to exploit the lethargy of the sector.

They sank hundreds of millions into this endeavour. Another time much latet some dudes from a prestigious private bank tried to create one of the first robo advisers. And so on.

Then just in general, do not underestimate the power of the American government to shut stuff down if it's in their interest.

Taking AMC and GME as examples, while the underlying fundamental value of the companies may be very low, as soon as the stock price jumps, regardless of the reason or meme-ness, the company can wipe out debt, restructure, and survive for months when it was close to bankruptcy. This is a huge change in the fundamentals, and that is BEFORE you account for how a company can take a change in stock price to use for higher equity, loans, hiring new key people to redirect the company and create new value, etc. A lot of people throw around ""meme"" as the ending of a statement, a meme-stock might actually reflect a paradigm shift in value-investing, where todays newer generation sees potential value in failing companies, and by investing actually creates the value they predict- it is the beginning of a statement, not the end. It is both a self-fulfulling prophecy, and making value out of nothing, in a sense, but it is actually the same thing that has always gone on in the market. Berkshire hathaway buys 20% of a company, then the press announces it- what happens, everyone else tries to jump in, creating a rise in value. That is what most institutional investors want- just entering a trade will increase the stocks value, since a lot of investing depends on confidence (in your choice). I have just started learning to invest, but these things seem obvious, in the same way that people driving horse carts thought that driving a car is going to be a fading trend, or that amazon would never be big, since they only sold books, and these are the experts that think Tesla is overvalued because it only sells cars, when it is a tech company, etc.

Take into account that the US has created (this is paraphrased from online, verifiable sources) approximately 20-25% of all dollars ever created (in value, not actual dollars) just in the last year. You hear a lot of discussion on how theres too much ""froth"" or liquidity in the market, which is leading to the current bubble. If you think that the dollar is artificially high in value (true devaluation of the dollar is not being allowed to happen), what do most people do? Invest in hedges- silver, gold, or in this case crypto. If the US pulled back all liquidity, and allowed the dollar to rise in value 50% what do you think would happen- probably shift out of crypto/gold/etc.

66,AAPL," ARKG is kind of whack. TDOC is the biggest holding. Why? What is the moat? Too many nothingburger companies in that ETF. Telehealth companies are a dime a dozen. I'd rather hold GNOM and even that probably has too many holdings, but at least better allocations than ARKG.

Edit:  ARKG isn't exactly a genomics fund - it's a biotech/genomics/sequencing/medical device/telehealth space fund. In these areas there are some clear chip companies, just like any other industry. I have an MS related to the field, and hospitals/clinics as an engineer and other roles for 5 years before switching to tech, so many of these companies are familiar to me in my professional experience and I worked for some. . 

 JNJ, Illumina, Invitae, (don't know which of CRSP/NTLA/EDIT/BEAM will win so split them 50/20/10/10), Agilent, ABBV, Amgen, PacBio, 10X, Guardant Health, TXG, ISRG, NVRO, LLY (they just created a pill that can treat type II diabetes. Millions are going to want to take this daily rather than sticking themselves with a needle), SGMO, TDOC (but much less than Cathie), HIMS, and maybe a sprinkle of AAPL and GOOG in here too. 


That's 21 companies, GNOM has 40 and ARKG has 60.

I suppose I could always open up a new brokerage account just for these companies, but without a tool or service to help you set specific allocations and purchase fractional shares if needed, it would be a lot of work.",oarabbus,9,/r/investing/comments/nq52cp/exploiting_retail_investing_causing_market/h0986iq/,0.012,0.881,0.107,0.9879

In 2020, I went overweight aggressive growth in March because I thought those names would have a strong recovery over 1-2 years. Instead the market went basically higher for months on end. The portfolio restructuring that I did between late Summer of last year and earlier this year was basically dialing back that aggressive growth and going back to something that looks more like what I owned 2-3 years ago. 

A sizable portion is devoted to more aggressive/speculative growth (SE, SHOP, etc) and a sizable portion is now devoted to slow(er) growth/high quality businesses that in many cases benefit to some degree from inflation/being able to pass off higher prices/have some exposure to hard assets/supply ""needs"" and/or essential services/etc.

Not much doing in stocks so far, with S&P 500 futures pointing to a flat open. Dow Industrials are up about 0.1% with the Nasdaq down about 0.1%. That’s as of 0630.

There are other pockets of rallies. I probably don’t need to tell you about AMC, which was up 22% yesterday. Reopening names are doing well along with energy stocks.

Not much on the economic calendar today. The Fed Beige Book is out this afternoon. These are anecdotes of economic activity reported by the Fed’s various districts. There are only eight of these a year and they come 15 days or so before the Fed meets to decide interest rate policy.

229,AMC," You're talking about the cinema stock. Rapid movements in the stock price aren't normal. When things move too quickly, IV shoots up. Your contract is in the rare spot where even though the price has gone against you, it's gone up in value due to the volatility spike. IV affects the price of your option because it adds uncertainty, and therefore it's more expensive to get someone to buy/sell an AMC options contract, as no one is quite sure if AMC will plummet to 1$ or rocket up to 200$",f1_manu,29,/r/investing/comments/nqrjup/why_is_my_put_option_gaining_value_if_the_stock/h0c84kn/,0.048,0.9,0.052,0.101

231,TSLA," If you're new to options, I would suggest you take some money off the table, take some wins and hold the rest. If you only have 1 contract, yes you can let it ride. But think of it this way: you made some % gain in 3 hours doing almost no work. The future is uncertainty, so sometimes its great to lock in gains now which is certain.

Either way, as stated above the reason your option is up is due to IV. Here are the things that affect options price:

1. Delta - How close the current price is to the strike. Closer means higher delta, further away means lower delta. Thats why options that are over 20% away are normally fractions of the stock price. While options that are deep ITM just move with the price of the stock. The option can go up if the stock price moves closer to your OTM strike.
2. Theta - Time decay away to expiration. Longer the time to expiration, the higher the theta. Theta always goes to zero as expiration date approaches.
3. Gamma - Change in the delta. This one I'm always weak on, but higher gamma means greater change in deltas between strike prices.
4. Stock price (ITM/OTM) - Deep ITM options have low delta and just move with stock price. Deep OTM options have low delta and are highest risk because they are most likely to expire worthless.
5. IV - The implied volatility. How much a stock may move before its strike. IV goes up and down based on factors such as earnings report date, recent stock movements, etc.

If a stock remains flat for a long time (like TSLA did through November) then shoots up a lot (Like TSLA did right after S&P inclusion was announced), IV can increase and the option will end up having more extrisinic value. This shift in IV can offset the change in delta.",radarbot,4,/r/investing/comments/nqrjup/why_is_my_put_option_gaining_value_if_the_stock/h0cwhtz/,0.097,0.817,0.086,-0.038

238,AMC," Yep.  

Purchasing options puts you at a maximum loss risk of the premium you paid for those options. Worst case scenario is that the options expire out of the money, aka worthless.  
  
Writing a call option puts you at unlimited maximum risk (assuming the option is naked, a.k.a. not backed up by shares you already own) since theoretically the maximum price of a stock is infinite.  
  
Writing a put option puts you at a maximum risk of 100 * strike price less the premium you received, assuming the company you wrote the put option for goes bankrupt/is delisted and you are now holding 100 worthless shares that you purchased for the strike price.  
  
Edit: With all of this said, there's a reason people say to limit your exposure to options -- they are inherently riskier than owning stock because there is a limited time component. For example -- many people were burned on AMC by purchasing far OTM call contracts that wound up expiring worthless. If they had instead purchased the stock, they would still have some equity, and at this point would have turned a tidy profit. The trade-off is that options, when lucky/done well, can provide many multiples higher percent returns, since they act as a form of leveraging.

I've been using the Investing.com app as my tracking tool, not for my holding- I use My Stock Portfolio for that- but for tracking stocks I'm watching and interested in. However, it has some pretty significant downsides, mainly that only 40 tickers are allowed to be tracked in any given view, not showing mini graphs next to the ticker (like RH does; not that I use RH), and overall it has a pretty dated UX.

Anyways, I was wondering what /r/investing 's favorite tracking tools were. I'm a pretty novice investor but I do like watching specific stocks, ETF's, etc, as I learn about them and want the best experience to be able to consume information as my interests start growing, so I was wondering what you guys like to use and why.

246,OR," Asset allocation in index funds in fidelity: independently done or done by funds


Looking into asset allocation I was wondering if there are there specific funds that allocate a specific percentage in stocks/bonds for you or if you have to manually calculate and buy the right percentage of stocks and bonds accordingly. This is all based in fidelity. 

 like do you have to individually calculate your money and see how much you would have to buy funds in stocks and bonds say like 90% stocks and 10% bonds. OR if there are like funds or baskets that automatically do this for you which are not target date funds. Not sure if this makes sense but I hope it does.

How do i invest in these? Is there a website i can do it through? I looked it up and apparently there's something called FXAIX that has really low fees of 0.015% but i have no idea how to invest through that or what it is. Is it the same as the S&P 500 or something completely different?

I looked on my bank (Nationwide) and it says i can invest through there but with what looks like a 0.86% annual fee and it is also on something called 'LF Aegon Multi-Asset 2 Fund'. I have absolutely no idea what this is or what it would put money into and i can't seem to find this information anywhere. If anyone could answer my questions that would be amazing.

250,APR," What's your level of experience so far? Shorting carries considerably more risk than ordinary trading that ideally you would spend at least six months in the market before starting to mess around with options, particularly shorting. 

The margin requirements on a covered call will vary by broker and by security. Some companies have ""marginable"" securities and others have ""non-marginable."" This indicates whether or not the values of the shares can be pledged as collateral in a covered option for that stock (i.e. you would need to see whether AGG is a marginable security, meaning you can pledge the value of your securities against covered options, or a non-marginable one, meaning you can't). Your broker should be able to show you at any time what your marginable and non-marginable purchasing power is, which is the total of your cash balance and the value of securities. The collateral you pledge is subtracted from those figures so you can't spend or withdraw it until the option is closed. With shorting, as the stock rises, the collateral required will also rise, meaning you could be subject to a margin call - a requirement that you deposit cash to cover the shortfall - if you run out of available purchasing power. 

If you have to borrow to cover your shortfall, the interest rates will also vary by broker. At Etrade I think it's 8 or 9 percent APR, compounded daily.

254,UK," If you are outside of the US make sure to read up on the tax implications of whatever it is that you want to do. Another thing is reading up on the US estate tax if your country doesn't have a treaty with the US and you want to buy US domiciled ETFs. Also, I think EU citizens can't buy US domiciled ETFs and would have to buy something from Ireland or similar that mirrors the S&P 500. The bogleheads wiki has some info: https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/EU_investing 

No idea how the situation is in the UK.

With (index) funds you usually have mutual funds or ETFs, I suggest reading up on what that means.

Another thing, the cost of those things can ramp up if you're not careful. 1% yearly cost per year means you only make 99% of what you could have made per year. Every year. This compounds. 0.99 * 0.99 * 0.99*... Do this 25 times and your potential return is reduced by 23%. That's why a lot of people try to invest into index funds with low fees. It's of course not the only thing that is important, and sometimes people overly obsess over this.

From my experience (Switzerland) I would never keep a portfolio at my bank, because the fees and commission fees and so on are ridiculous compared to brokers like Interactive Brokers.

261,IRS," If your option is exercised and you have to buy shares to sell them, that'll be taxed as short-term gain because you'll have held the shares for less than 1 year + 1 day. Short-term gains are taxed at your regular income tax rate, functionally the same as if your day job had increased your pay by that amount.

If you already own enough securities to fulfill the call if required without buying any, and you've held them for 1 year + 1 day, that'll be taxed as long-term gain. That's 20% for most people (15% if you have less than I think $15,000/year income, or something similarly low) which is almost undoubtedly less than your current marginal rate.

If you already own them but have held for less than 1y+1d, that's short-term gain.

I don't know if any brokerages withhold taxes on trades executed. Mine doesn't. Whenever I make a sale, I calculate my profit and then stick 20% of that in a dedicated savings account. (Note that's 20% of the profits, not 20% of the proceeds. And you'd want to stash a higher % for short-term gains.) Around March, your brokerage will send you and the IRS a 1099-B form that sums up how much capital gains profit or loss you had in the preceding calendar year, which you'll input on your 1040 to calculate tax liability.

If you have a day job and usually get a tax refund because payroll tends to err on the side of withholding too much instead of too little, it's possible - maybe even likely - that you'll never have to touch the savings account money, you just won't get (as big of) a refund as you would have otherwise gotten. Essentially some of that excess that would have been refunded will cover your capital gains tax. But I always recommend having all the cash you might need to pay your taxes on hand just in case, because you never know what might happen by next April.",emikoala,1,/r/investing/comments/nqhedp/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/h0c9ref/,0.023,0.835,0.142,0.9904

265,MRNA," I only own five shares of MRNA at $125, and I'm not buying more at this price, but if you're looking for the bull case I might be able to add a little. 

First,  the vaccine is just the jump start,  the mRNA technology really does look like a game changer, it has the possibility to yield a lot more cures for things that couldn't be cured with traditional small molecule chemical stuff.  

The vaccine isn't the long term future,  which is why they said that they wouldn't enforce the patent on it, the key is the ability (and manufacturing knowledge) to put the mRNA in the lipid shell to make it work.   That method can be adapted to a whole lot of other treatments.  The big hope is that the government will have faster approval for these new treatments (like they do with flu vaccine and have said they will do with Covid boosters).  

The short term vaccine side boost is that the dosing is much higher than needed (somewhat Intentional to make sure it got approved fast), so future vaccine production could be faster (less product per needle).  

Good luck.",bernie638,6,/r/investing/comments/nqnzgw/mrna_ath_sustainable_discussion/h0bq2mk/,0.016,0.823,0.161,0.9846
266,MRNA," Appreciate the thoughts. If they don't enforce the patent then current proprietary knowledge (lipid nano-particle & associated tech) becomes public and market forces will get to have their way. The bull case seems to be ""they could do crazy MRNA things one day"" - I guess, yeah. But that's sort of been knowledge since last summer, and a decent portion of its boon can be attributed to this, but I think post Jan 1st MRNA has been trading solely on vaccine hype, and this hype train could do a 180 on Ivermectin news",pax_developer,1,/r/investing/comments/nqnzgw/mrna_ath_sustainable_discussion/h0bvloj/,0.019,0.942,0.039,0.1901
267,MRNA," The part others have a hard time copying is the manufacturing process,  getting the lipids to coat completely with the correct thickness is really hard. 

The big win for MRNA is somewhat the vaccine,  but more the fact that the government approved an mRNA injection.   That part had been holding up a lot of potential applications since it was new and new things are scary.   The big boost after that was the idea that the booster for the new virus strain only needs to show effectiveness,  not safety, which is faster and easier and makes it more likely that other cures (example HIV) could also be approved that way.

Ivermectin is great that it works as a treatment,  but a lot of people would rather avoid getting sick by getting vaccinated even if an effective treatment is available.   If MRNA vaccine is effective at half the current dosing,  they could almost double the amount of vaccine production.   

I agree MRNA stock is pricy here (I'm notbuyingmore), but it does have a few possible paths to make it worth it.   I'm not a buyer here because there are things that could still go wrong,  but if everything goes right it may keep going up quite a ways.",bernie638,0,/r/investing/comments/nqnzgw/mrna_ath_sustainable_discussion/h0c56fd/,0.094,0.753,0.153,0.9531
