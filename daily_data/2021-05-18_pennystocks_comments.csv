“Among the bulls is Maxim’s 5-star analyst, Jason McCarthy, who sees a clear path forward for the company.
“Management is executing on its strategy and off the heels of a positive, but COVID-19 impacted year, ADMA is poised for a breakout in 2021. Multiple initiatives should drive revenue and margin acceleration. In particular, ASCENIV’s new J-code and multiple manufacturing initiatives, including the new fill-finish machine and BIVIGAM’s capacity expansion to ~4,400 L, should drive sales and margin acceleration in 2H21,” McCarthy opined.
The analyst added, “There is valuation disconnect between the company’s plasma collection facilities + sales potential vs. the market cap, in our opinion. Grifols recently acquired 25 US-based plasma centers for ~$370M, valuing each center at ~$15M. ADMA has 7 centers in various stages of development/ approval, and is planning to expand to 10 fully operational by 2024. The company is already on a ~$55M run-rate, with accelerating sales and on pace for potentially ~$250M by 2024. Management is executing, and we believe the intrinsic value of the plasma facilities and approved products already should exceed the company’s market cap.”
In line with these expectations, McCarthy rates ADMA a Buy, and his $6 price target indicates confidence in a robust 266% growth potential for the coming year.”",davidkozin,4,/r/pennystocks/comments/nf0a7l/adma_is_170_yet_six_6_analysts_cover_it_all_buy/gyj433s/,0.0,0.847,0.153,0.9867

65,RS," Usually it takes time for the RS to go through so shares are locked up. Because most can't sell, the prices artificially increase. Then people get upset because they don't have their shares and they can't sell at the high price. When the price starts tanking, then you'll know people got their shares back. It usually takes a week.",serenewaters,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/nf3ovh/daily_plays_may_18_2021/gyk7xdv/,0.039,0.797,0.164,0.8073
66,DD," As a rule, you will want to pay attention to what they and the market do now for a few weeks. Often after a reverse split it will slowly drift down for a period until there is some news or catalysts that will drive it. I would think if they had those coming though they might have waited to do the reverse split. The fact they didn't do 10 to 1 is a good sign though as they could have cut it a lot more for a much higher price so that tells me they don't expect to have a lot of price reduction going forward. My best advice is that, if the company's story and driving value have not changed then the company still should do what you expect it too. This of course assumes you have some solid DD to justify growth.",ToastTurtle,2,/r/pennystocks/comments/nf3ovh/daily_plays_may_18_2021/gykinw2/,0.024,0.872,0.104,0.8885
67,TD," I just meant that after the 15-1 consolidation, some people were reporting seeing their original number of shares (for example 1500 instead of 100) but with the new price (\~$8 instead of \~$0.50). If that's what you were seeing, it was a glitch and you could not have actually sold it. Your broker should either be showing your original # of shares and the lower price, or the new number of shares with the higher price. For me, TD is still showing the old figures, but with no ticker attached, and I can't do anything with them. I think most people are in this boat right now.",gemthing,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/nf3ovh/daily_plays_may_18_2021/gyl1i4n/,0.05,0.823,0.127,0.7003
68,EVFM," This stock . . . EVFM continues to get FDA approvals, listing in DoD pharmacies, and presents at conference after conference with new and successful treatments but cannot break into the commercial market. The board cannot steer this company into profits. My wee shares recently voted against every returning board member as they cannot create any returns for shareholders. I also voted against this dumbass ‘offering’ for fast cash. 

I’ll hold my shares until bankruptcy, which appears to be just around the corner with these people. With any luck, a grownup pharmaceutical company will buy EVFM and maybe I’ll break even.

EVFM has good science, R&D, policy, and processes. They just are not very good at business.",Buck_Murica,5,/r/pennystocks/comments/nf8gjr/evfm_offering_play/gyk7zal/,0.06,0.765,0.175,0.9377
69,DD," So I jumped on board in February at the height of everything in pennies with 5k. Everything and literally all my picks dumped between 15-89%. Plyz takes the cake. Rycey, hitid, and zbbisf I think may go green. I saw this post and said fuck it. I sold 4 stocks that I was down 50% on ship, ctrm, alyi, opti. I had bought into zcmd after some excellent DD the other day by one of you apes. Today I bought 1000 shares of evem at .80. Im up 50.00. My first actual win.

70,EVFM," Yeah, this is wild how overlooked the offerings of EVFM are. It has to be the climate as there is so much going on that reproductive health and STD prevention is not even in the backseat - it’s hanging off the bumper as far a visibility is concerned. They may market if they can get in front of a celebrity influencer or activist investors. I really thought EVFM would have gotten some media by now for their anti STD / contraceptive / lube.

2) Low float cheap stocks are much harder to day-trade, as they don’t follow traditional patterns as often. (Large positions at cheap prices leads to greater variance) aka low float/ most otcs. 

3) I don’t think you’re losing cause of the price of the stock, I think you’re losing because it seems your deficient in the knowledge required to consistently profit.
