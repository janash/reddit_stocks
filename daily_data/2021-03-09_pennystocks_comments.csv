If we're unhappy with the quality of what is passing for DD or a catalyst, then make recommendations for what *should* be included. There are plenty of good guides for what all qualifies as DD, investopedia has a good example that has 10 factors/steps to look at. I think taking a shortcut and only looking at one of these prior to deciding to jump in (or worse... none of these factors) would be a mistake. [Investopedia Due Diligence in 10 Easy Steps](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/08/due-diligence.asp)

I don't think a single mention of a conference or a comment about management qualifies as DD, but these are both factors that could be *part* of DD. So it's more of a comment to get things going that someone else (if they choose) can weigh-in on.

In all seriousness though, Investopedia is a gold mine of free information. They have a good article on what ratios are important for Penny Stocks here: [The Most Crucial Financial Ratios for Penny Stocks](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/061915/most-crucial-financial-ratios-penny-stocks.asp) They also explain why sometimes P/E isn't the right indicator but P/S might be better, or Price/Cash-Flow if sales are unreliable (or non-existent). 

Especially because some companies that *could* be good long-term bets have current earnings of zero (or are losing money)! This is especially true when talking about very young companies (e.g. look at some of the DD here for HYSR, the company has lots of potential on the horizon, but they're a risk.... they could just as easily fold).

The other question you need to ask yourself is: What kind of trading you are planning to do? P/E is a possible indicator of whether the market is currently over or undervaluing a company. The degree to which this matters all depends on how long you plan to stick with the stock.

If you go by all marriages of all years and ranges, the divorce rate has actually dropped to 46%. 

And if you reference the graph, you will see that over the last ten years, total divorce rates were less than 33%. The only reason it’s “risen” back to 46% is that marriage rates themselves took a massive dip in recent years (especially over the last year). But looking at the chart, you can still see that divorce is in a steady decline. 

But the statistic I think would be more important which is the above statistic, is that the divorce rate of new marriages is on a stark decline. This is the statistic that is going to be more relevant to people who are not yet married.

Might need to try with 5x more money per stock and maybe resell the ones that worked out well that day and hold the ones that didn't. I was initially thinking longer term when purchasing, but if they normally can move up even 10%+ perhaps it's worth selling again or at least selling part of it. Sell enough so that what you keep is totally free and then keep that waiting long term for it to potentially multiple several times or would that be crap?

1. $45 mil US cash.
2. 80 mil shares
3. Selling for .50 Canadian on the TSX (Toronto Stock Exchange) as VLE and in London under VLU.
4. Experienced team in overseas oil and gas ventures, with notable successes.
5. Looking to make a combination of a number of smaller oil and gas companies with potential but no cash. They have an excellent chance to succeed because of their strong cash position. They have been working on this combination for some time and expect an announcement by the end of March 2021.
6. They do have assets in Turkey with potentially substantial upside.
7. The March 3, 2021 interview of one of their advisors summarises their prospects: https://www.valeuraenergy.com/investor-information/presentations/

Summary: I like and own the stock.

This is not financial advise.

The company operates in three segments: Herbs and Produce Products; Cannabis Dispensary, Cultivation and Production; and Real Estate and Construction. 

Few key highlights:

* Recent CEO change back in December 2020. Seems to be a smart competent guy (Upenn grad, capital markets experience)
* They recently purchased Unrivaled, and the CEO came out and said they expect $70M+ in 2021 revenue. Current LTM revenue of $26M
* Market cap of around $75M so it seems the company is trading at a massive discount vs. other weed stocks

When I compare them to others such as SNDL (LTM revenue of $60M, market cap of $2bn), it seems that TRTC is massively undervalued. Anything that I'm missing?

It bounces respecting the cloud, as you can see in the arrows in the image. And finally breaks with great volume. I usually look for this.

So for us Longs this is a good indication the start of the above sequence.  As I said in another reply they acquired Teishan Oil back in ?2016 or so.

The battery recycling company everybody knows is ABML which has about 900 million market cap and there was a one that just went public via a SPAC (think it is called Lithium One) that was valued at 1.7 BILLION.  In comparison, SXOOF market cap is 60 million!.  That means if it went 10x it would only make it up to 2/3 the price of ABML.  That is just comparing it based on its ONE subdivision of battery recycling.
