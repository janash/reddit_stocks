- RMB , no one trust China on currency matters, not even the rich Chinese which is why they buy/move money  overseas.
- EURO:nope,  a confederation of fiscally opposite economies with lots of economic turmoil, only kept in check by a few countries (Germany and France)
- GBP: with Brexit and other economic challenges who knows.
- YEN;  poor  GDP/debt ratio , aging workforce..
- GOLD: as a store of value it works , but not as a currency (what can you pay in gold directly)l, it's not very portable, can have large price  fluctuations and it's not backed by any sovereign entity.
- CRYPTO:: nope, never (unless its CBDC)   no sovereign government is ever  going to give up it's ability to have some currency control, for a wide variety of reasons, taxes, trade etc.

32,API," My personal pick is the move towards modern APIs, from custom software integrations.

Modern APIs usually have the following attributes:

1. Open and clear documentation
2. Self-service signup and use
3. Open sandboxes for testing in advance of sale
4. All features are developed for the core API product; the company providing the API does not perform custom work even for larger customers
5. The API abstracts away as much complexity as possible, with upstream changes handled under the hood, so that it changes rarely and almost never breaks

This compares to traditional software integrations, which are high-touch affairs that require constant manual updating.

The premier examples are:

1. Traditional payment software -> Stripe
2. Traditional server software -> modern cloud computing companies

Some picks for this trend are:

Meanwhile, if we were to ever create AI at human or super human levels, we’d face three immediate problems: how do we train in a manner that’s less costly than flesh humans? How do we evaluate, gauge and eventually trust performance? And, lastly: any AI with that level of proficiency should be treated just like a flesh person, which will come with its own problems and period of adjustment if history is any guide.",uriejejejdjbejxijehd,1,/r/investing/comments/n9odr2/what_is_the_longest_future_trend_you_know_of_that/gxqm89b/,0.118,0.766,0.116,0.5187

77,IAG," Amen, and investing is about finding value where others have not. 100 people all spouting future trends means nothing if everyone else in the world already thinks it and the stocks are priced accordingly.

My long term play would be airlines. The size of the middle class in China will be equal to that of the whole of Europe probably in the next 10-20 years and other countries will be developing. People will want to be flying more, domestically and internationally. I don't think environmental concerns will have that much of an effect on prices, flight prices are still relatively cheap for what they are: a few hundred dollars to travel to the other side of the world or 10's of dollars to travel between European countries, with some airlines.

People will want to travel more and business will be more international, due to globalisation and people needing to meet for meetings. 

I just did a quick google and Delta Airlines and IAG were both sitting at a PE ratio of below 10, pre-covid.

That said, counter point to your argument. A few decades ago the US government spent billions of dollars mapping out the human DNA. Things went very slow for a while, the cost per gene mapped was quite high at the beginning. But as we got better at it, and improved our technology, the cost has gone down a lot since. 

This often happens in new fields, the more experience we get the more costs go down, and the better we get at tackling bigger and more complex problems.

86,ETH," Remind of the time when people could autonomously stake their tulip bulbs to earn passive income, become a liquidity provider, yield farm, swap between tulips or lend 24/7 all from home without a centralized account ie. Decentralized Finance (DeFi)?

Once you've driven off the fiat ramp, you actually own and control your crypto keys, which can't be said about a centralized bank account. No one needs to verify or check that you're swapping some ETH for another token or buying an NFT to trade. There's no transaction limits. However, there is a varying degree of responsibility (security practices, properly tracking and paying taxes, etc) and a learning curve to get over.

I remember the time it clicked for me: I was able to pay and settle an advertising deal in a few seconds to another country with just their ETH address. No IBAN or SWIFT or adding a payee and waiting for a wire transfer to execute and settle. You can transmit value from one address to another without a middle person and transparency track the transaction. The receiving party can opt to convert their crypto to fiat or a stablecoin, which is pegged to fiat but can be exchanged through various chains and later converted to fiat and into a traditional bank account.

Crypto happened to change my life forever. I got in and out when I did, but there's always someone else who got in earlier or lower than you--you'll rarely sell at the top. Accepting the reality of your decisions is an individualistic emotional exercise. The markets have been working in bull/bear cycles so far; gains are gains after all. Set your goals and try to stick with them or just wait things out until something becomes significant to your situation. Do not take this as investment advice but I would want to see a many month trend of lower prices to buy in long term. Now or anytime is great for short term activity despite the historically high prices.

The whole thing of crypto having no intrinsic value is a pretty sloppy argument that I've been hearing for years. Crypto isn't traditional finance or regulated as such. I don't believe anything has intrinsic value. An individual and society give value to things. Sometimes you don't need a persistent or objective value to make gains in the short term. If you're getting stuck at this part, maybe crypto isn't for you in this form.

All of the naysayers out there have their own beliefs and opinions. Some of my friends felt the same 4-5 years ago and I wonder if they ever came around. Not everyone is going to be ready at the same time. You can be scared about something new or not understand it, but that doesn't make anything more or less true. It also doesn't get you closer to exploring a new frontier. I can attest that through the noise, there is enough incentive that everyone should at least hedge a little into crypto. Just owning a little gives an inherent incentive to learn more about what you bought. You may not like it or understand everything, but it's an experience where you will at least come out knowing more than you started with, even if your portfolio goes into the dumps for a while.

Obviously 10,000+ coins won't all have value in the future. Many are just clones or created as iterations of other ideas and code. I still dabble with things and own a little of various coins that are both well-known and just for fun as moonshot bets. I believe in a cashless society and crypto is in the frontier of facilitating that eventual transition into the future decades. How big of a part it will play is anyone's guess.",guitarf1,0,/r/investing/comments/n9odr2/what_is_the_longest_future_trend_you_know_of_that/gxqv800/,0.045,0.833,0.121,0.9943
87,CNS," Yeah well I already have my PhD in genomics, published analysis on over 10k whole genomes in a CNS journal no less, and currently work for a biotech, if you are going to pull that card. 

Maybe you are too young to remember but the cost for a 30X genome really hasn’t changed in almost 10 years. You have to thank Illumina for propping up that cartel. 

Treatment is one thing, and might be sooner than you think with ASOs. Just look at how mRNA vaccines cut the time to make a novel one in about half. 25 years is a conservative estimate. 

Testing is where it’s at. 25 years ago MDs rarely sent tumors for genetic analysis and if they did it was a karyotype. Same thing goes for prenatal screening. Now for both you can take circulating DNA and look for chromosomal wide alterations. 15 years ago the number of genetic associations implicated in autism could fit on one hand. Now it’s over 100 known risk genes. Better to catch early than treat later. This is the immediate power and it’s catching on fast and keep an eye on those companies.",xXdoom--pooterXx,1,/r/investing/comments/n9odr2/what_is_the_longest_future_trend_you_know_of_that/gxr0u6f/,0.033,0.842,0.125,0.9575

94,ETH," I thought this sub would have smartened up instead of upvoting ""tulip"" everytime somehow wants to criticize crypto.

I have no idea how tech fluent you are but I hope this spurs you to dive into the details (I cant give them all to you at once). Fundamentally though take a token like ETH (Ethereum), it provides intrinsic value to the network by:

i) Being the literal fuel (cost) to run assembly code in ETH smart contracts

ii) Being required as an asset to stake to keep the network secure

Being used all day every day to this, right now (albeit ii) in a beta). The thing is obviously not all things are meant to be decentralized completely but everyday MASSIVE use cases are being proven out.

For those ecosystems to exist networks must tackle security and scale. Thats what you tradeoff when you have central player but you gain a system that requires trust in no-one. In order to achieve these things there must be incentives.. hence tokens and their value.

I'm not gonna say I am 100% know it all right but conversely your comment dismissed it all as some ponzi scheme. Go to the finematics youtube channel and at least be open-minded. Google the Byzantine general problem. At least to try learn a little bit without hype behind it.

Not an argument but its just disappointing that the least thought out criticism is getting these upvotes. To blindly paint it all as get rich quick is just not fair especially today living through 10+ years of people saying that.

PS: The Bitcoin use case is literally to avoiding getting poor over time via inflation, so if people are putting their money into it to gain value against USD then it is working exactly as intended. Not a scheme.",christianc750,6,/r/investing/comments/n9odr2/what_is_the_longest_future_trend_you_know_of_that/gxqd5bx/,0.072,0.777,0.151,0.9827
95,USA," This is... completely incorrect. The OP says nothing about international money movement, which is really all that matters. I work in information technology for a major FINTECH and treasury management corporation. The system used to transfer money internationally is called SWIFT, and was created decades ago. It is very expensive to wire money internationally as it's not a flat rate, but a percentage. Sending multiple millions of dollars can add up to tens of thousands of dollars and isn't fully settled for three days. With Bitcoin, right now, one can send one billion USD for under $50 and have it settled near instantaneously. Read that again. 

There is a reason that Paypal and Square are heavily moving in to the crypto space. It allows them to transfer money internationally exponentially easier and cheaper to serve as a back-end for their money transfer services. 

The reputation of Bitcoin has been damaged by alt-coins. It is correct to be cautious of crypto as a space in general. There are thousands of scam and copy-cat coins. The only one that is trustworthy, proven over a decade, decentralized, and has a large enough market-cap to be useful for corporations is Bitcoin. If publicly traded and SEC-regulated companies are making purchases and moving in to Bitcoin, you can rest assured that it is safe for the consumer.  Don't make that assumption for any other coin, including Eth.

Finally, the other major reason that Bitcoin will continue to move in an exponentially upward trajectory is the adoption by the entire rest of the planet that is not the USA or EU. There's a lot of talk about inflation and the danger of keeping your reserves in fiat money right now. Take whatever concerns you have and multiply that by one-thousand if you live anywhere else in the entire world, such as Turkey, Greece, or Africa, where new adopters are being onboarded at unprecedented rates. Bitcoin is rapidly becoming the new, decentralized, universal and trusted way to store and transfer value for normal people.

96,ACH," Crypto is the least convenient option RIGHT NOW. There are two narratives when it comes to DeFi. Actual utility and speculation. Right now speculators are becoming millionaires overnight due to where we are in the cycle. A year or two ago it’s utility was more discussed than its price potential. 

Decentralized finance has only been around for a few years. New protocols are being announced every month that continue to refine and cheapen transactions.  Compare it to one of the most common types of transfers in use by banks, the ACH, which has been around since the 70’s and still takes 2-5 business days to settle. 

Give DeFi time to mature and don’t get caught up with all the wildcatters making millions speculating.

97,ETH," If that's how you feel then good luck to you man, but if you think this revolution in Fintech is worthless and banks aren't aggressively working to capitalize then you're only fooling yourself. Big banks are not sitting idle while millions are moving out of their bank accounts and into crypto. People have been repeating these lines for years and yet here we are with VISA now accepting payment in crypto. Ethereum alone is outweighing VISA, JPmorgan and Bank of America with more than enough room to grow in ETH 2.0.

98,IMO," The current US banking system has been in a give and take with government oversight and centralized banking (FED) since the birth of this country if not earlier. I don't see why the government would give up the ability to interact with the country's currency and go the way of Greece in '08 or much worse. I see the cryptocurrency as either a get rich scheme or a libertarian pipe dream. I know the banking system has flaws, but why would the US, as a nation, give up the ability to manipulate our money supply? IMO the solution to the banking system is to address the issues, not replace it with a ""currency"" that is used for illegal activity 25% of the time.",Matt2_ASC,2,/r/investing/comments/n9odr2/what_is_the_longest_future_trend_you_know_of_that/gxq8wrg/,0.055,0.844,0.101,0.431
99,GDP," I'm going to preface this by saying I am by no means any kind of expert, this is just the way I see it.

A country's dollar is valued at the strength of that country. Whether it's that country's government institutions or the country's GDP. Nowadays a dollar is basically valued in comparison to other nation's currency. 

Gold is a precious metal that there is a finite amount of in the world. It can be used to make goods and while it can be melted down and reused, we can't make more of it than exists in the world. Sure, it may be most broadly known as a vanity good and was for a large part of human history, but it also has many other uses in things like electronics. 

You're just asking a question and I'm not trying to label you as anything else, but I do find it interesting that every time I make this comparison, I'm always followed up with ""Why is the dollar valued at what it is?"" Rather than, ""Well let me explain cryptocurrency should be valued at what it is.""",Frankie__Spankie,8,/r/investing/comments/n9odr2/what_is_the_longest_future_trend_you_know_of_that/gxq8ie9/,0.016,0.834,0.15,0.9752
100,IMO," The reason I ask that question is because I think it’s a critical first step toward attributing a value to Bitcoin. The numerical value of 1 Bitcoin is usually priced in terms of USD. But my question is why do we price in USD? If the Federal Reserve doubled the amount of dollars in circulation (M2 money supply to be precise) and everything else stated equal, then everything would get 2x more expensive. Your money would be worth 50% less. And so when we change the denominator from USD to purchasing power, or “monetary energy”, then you start to get a glimpse into why people
believe in the future value of Bitcoin and crypto more broadly.

And so when we look at “what should BTC / crypto be valued at”, first let’s remove the notion of the price of 1 BTC or 1 DOGE. Similar to stocks, just because a stock trades at x000 dollars or x0 dollars, doesn’t mean it’s inherently
more valuable. Market capitalization is what matters. 

So I guess I’m reframing your question from “what should the price of 1 BTC be in USD” into “what should the market cap of BTC be relative to other market caps, if USD is not the most useful denominator”.

And the answer to that, IMO, is much larger than 1 trillion USD when you consider the market cap of gold (11 trillion), off shore banking (13-20 trillion) and bonds (100 trillion+)",brandomango,2,/r/investing/comments/n9odr2/what_is_the_longest_future_trend_you_know_of_that/gxqcxze/,0.021,0.903,0.076,0.9073
101,GDP," I get it, and I thank you for writing that out. I do think that you are back now to debating crypto as an asset. With a few changes, we could imagine your reply being the bull case for gold in 2012, or 1980 before that. 

Do I think there is a higher level of inflation today than a few years ago? Sure, and especially in some segments like building materials, but there is a world of difference between a few percentage above normal and the hyper inflation that so many crypto advocates point to as a reason to flee from the USD. 

I think the FED's loose monetary policy is contributing a bit, not very munch. I see a tendency for people to describe it almost as if the money was being given and not loaned out. As we all know, loans (usually) have to be repaid, so I think the currency destroying aspect of those cheap loans has been dramatically overstated. 

Additionally, it is important recognize there are many other macro-factors which are all likely contributing to inflation. 
-	GDP shrunk last year due to COVID. This can be viewed as the nation ""saving"" some spending that it might have otherwise done. With COVID receding, it's natural to expect increased spending. 
-	Related to above, we saw a shift in consumer spending during COVID away from in-person services, and toward some goods. (I.e. fewer vacations, more home improvement projects, more eating at home)
-	Again with COVID, people sought to move out cities and remote work. Generally they could buy bigger houses by moving to the burbs. There has been less move into the cities so far, so the demand is more one of way, pushing prices. 
-	The actual housing (and thus building materials) supply had an unusually bad year in terms of natural disasters. 2020 was one of the most destructive wildfire years in terms of structures lost; there were 5 hurricanes that made landfall in the US; and in early 2021, there was the Texas Freeze event that caused tens billions of dollars in property damage. (Frozen pipes burst that become water damage, etc.)
-	Markets in general (stock, crypto, real estate) have been on a tear, despite COVID. This leads many of those asset holders (using that term loosely with crypto! 😉) having more money to throw around and buy up things. 

I offer all this not to say that I know the *real* reason that a sheet of plywood costs more, but that I'm very skeptical of using FED monetary policy as the backbone for an argument about the death of the dollar to establish crypto's value.",Xiipre,1,/r/investing/comments/n9odr2/what_is_the_longest_future_trend_you_know_of_that/gxqn557/,0.105,0.831,0.064,-0.981

103,PLTR," PLTR is a real growth stock with real affirmations of their projections and value with development of tech and time.

Literally the only problem with this stock, at least in my eyes, is their overwhelming float of shares - but I'm not sure if this or the market cap really matters, it's an extremely high-volume and liquid stock that will probably have ~40-50% solid gains annually (so long as we don't tank by mid-2022, which of course remains a possibility on the table at current valuations anyway).

I have 0 shares, considered buying in at ~16 pre-market today, but missed the boat.

This may sound strange. 

Here's what it means for this case, practically speaking. It's a wash sale if any of these conditions are met:

1. You buy more AMZN shares within 30 days after selling any AMZN shares
2. You sell AMZN shares that you bought within the last 30 days

My concern isn't what's going on in the current market with PLTR, but what it will do in the future. There will be many sector rotations before I think PLTR will pay off. 

The rest of your complaints are fair. I personally like PLTR cheaper (about $3-$5 cheaper) for some of those reasons. Especially the lack of profitability the past 17 years. 

However some of those points can be turned against themselves. You see the private sector presence (or lack thereof) as a negative. I see it as a growth potential.",PressurePass,2,/r/investing/comments/n9snsw/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/gxrcxd6/,0.144,0.722,0.134,-0.4914

245,HUGE," Since my post keeps getting removed...

So I'm fairly new in this topic. I did some reading in the threads provided here but it didn't quite provide the answers I was looking for.

Currently I (27M) am working in a company that provides a ESPP, up to 15% of my salary monthly, purchased in 6 month installments (at a 15% discount). I can change my contribution once per year (every May) and cash out every 6 months (after the purchase has been completed). Currently I contribute 3% of my salary only, but want to bump it up to 10%. The ESPP is done via eTrade. This is where my questions begin: I would like to sell my stocks (as I don't want to be holding single stock) and invest in some ETFs or something more secure. I see Vanguard recommended a lot on here but since my plan is through eTrade I would prefer keeping it simple and using them- but how do I begin?

Any good resources to read up on this, to properly set up my account for this and any other tips to a beginner?

One additional note I would make is that I am a dual citizen (US/German) and live and pay taxes in Germany. However the Etrade account is US based, and in USD. What sort of tax implications do I face and how do I deal with them?

257,USA," Thanks for taking a peek, I am trying to plan out my savings/investments to better prepare for a life with my wife and appreciate any help.

My current gross income, at a local government agency, is $52k/yr. I am 31 and my wife is 34, we reside in Florida, USA. She is a home maker at the moment while she studies, and currently our rent is not a concern.

I am saving as much as possible, most of our money goes to food, at $600/mo for two adults. We also have two large breed dogs, and two paid off cars. No other debt/big expenses right now. We are unable to file jointly right now because my wife's legal status is pending.

I have a healthcare plan with my job that includes vision, dental, and a health savings account account setup. I have not set up my 457b yet, but there is no employer match. I do also benefit from a pension and union, if I keep my job.

I have $12,000 in a Vanguard Roth IRA that I have not invested yet, and $3,000 in an Individual account with Vanguard as well. I was thinking about doing 100% VTSAX in the Roth IRA and 100% VTWAX in the taxable individual account. I would buy when it goes down a little more, as they seem like they will dip a bit soon. Are these good investments and or ratios?

I also have $12,000 in an Ally savings account with .50% APY, and $6,000 in various stocks ($3,000 in ARKK :/) with a Fidelity Individual account. I don't see much a choice right now other than holding until there is profit to be made.

I plan on saving as much as possible, keeping a few months of emergency funds in a savings account, and investing the rest for at least a year. Then I would sell investments if I needed something like a down payment for a house.

Is this a good plan? My risk tolerance is high for my retirement account, but I would like to have something separate for a house, as I may need a down payment in a year.

265,VERY," Start by finding a brokerage.  At least here in the US, they have a lot of useful research and ""how to"" to work with.  How much time and effort you can put into the investing should directly correlate to how simple you keep things.  i.e. if you don't have a lot of time for it, stick to broadly diversified market tracking types of things and don't do things that take a lot of maintenance.  since you are quite young you have a VERY long time horizon before you ""need"" the money, which means you can seek capital appreciation.

266,IMO," The old rule of thumb on buying houses was 3x gross income for a house assuming you had the down payment in hand.  It's really a cash flow decision on the part of the lender, so it is more sophisticated than that, however, Simple math says you need to find something else to target besides a $750K house, as you are more likely to qualify in the 200s.  So I'd recommend setting that goal further out in the future and focusing on what is in front of you.

You have a certain amount of cash flow to work with besides your savings, so think in terms of what is coming in and what is going out.  Set aside $$ to cover your non-discretionary expenses.  whatever that leaves you with is free cash flow ... split that into three things... 1) emergency fund sized to cover you for 3-6 months.  this is one of those things that needs to be reevaluated as your life changes.  you probably have more than enough already if you sequester part of the 30K.. so maybe you don't need any new cash.  2)  tax advantaged retirement.... Roth IRA and/or company 401K if there is one.  3) pay down the student loans (you don't have an unmanageable amount... so IMO paying that out of cash flow is fine if you have something better to do with your savings)

now if you have cash flow above and beyond that... well, some of it you should have fun with and some of it can go into taxable investing.  whatever's left of the  30K and the free cash flow could be a way to start investing... since it is a long term project and you can always tap into it for other things you want along the way, you have plenty of flexibility.  go for capital appreciation at your age... no need for bonds.",LiqCourage,1,/r/investing/comments/n9sn7g/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gxrko85/,0.028,0.86,0.113,0.9794
