Now for drug dealers they should def be careful about how they withdrawal the btc and where it goes after leaving the site but it’s like that w any currency. 

But really the main point is that something like PayPal or a bank absolutely wouldn’t allow any transactions for things like drugs on a dark web site which is the main reason it’s used. Yes idiots think it’s anon but the REAL criminals, like the ones actually selling things like drugs know what it is and how to use it. 

Back when I was 15 (I was stupid Ik) I used btc to buy drugs and u can v easily use anon wire transfers to send money over to reputable btc buyers n sellers if u find the right sites. That’s how I did it years ago b4 btc ATMs and without even owning a bank account.

As for the whole battery excuse you made: GM and Volkswagen will pay around 65$ to 75$ per kwh by 2024 where tesla will pay 50$. The difference may seem large but in reality its not. As for oil, the trillion dollar industry isn't going anywhere for atleast 40 years unfortunately. Oil is just so energy dense that there will be other uses for it.

No. Didn't consider it yesterday. Don't consider it now. Not likely to consider it much in the future. Did consider it a bit when corporate goon BS was CEO. INTC is a huge company, with deep ties, existing infrastructure, will benefit from Biden as the ""US option"" for chips, and is in a growing industry which shelters it from the multiple competitors eating away at it.

If ARM is going to be the dominant architecture, why hasn't it happened yet?  ARM is not new, nor are challenges to the x86 market.

2. A portfolio with a lesser variety compared to the one above, probably around 4/5 types of shares, meaning your equity is divided into those 4/5 different shares **OR**
3. A portfolio style that is not mentioned above

Okay I'm gonna be honest here - the reason for me asking this is because my portfolio is the one mentioned in the first case, and I feel that with that many different stocks, it's relatively harder for me to keep track of ALL the news, reports, analysis of the stocks as compared to a portfolio with fewer variety. I guess its safer in the first case?

My current aim is to have my portfolio provide a substantial passive income on the side whilst I focus on my education.

About 3 years ago I officially switched my permanent address with all my banks, etc. to my house here in England. My husband and I intend on going traveling (pandemic permitting!) in early 2022 for at least 6 months to a year. At this time we will give up the house we're renting and use either my parents' address in the US or his parents' address in the UK as our 'permanent' address. 

We've recently been gifted $30,000 and would like to invest that money in ETFs or mutual funds. We initially planned on doing so with Vanguard, but quickly discovered that this was not as straightforward as we originally thought because I'm no longer a US resident. I suppose one option is to delay investing for another year until we give up our UK address and switch to my parents', but that would mean a year without making any gains. However, I don't know if this is preferable over opting for some sort of international brokerage account.

Has anyone been in a similar position? Could you offer any advice?

As a final aside -- I've had a domestic account with Charles Schwab for nearly 10 years. However I never use it anymore and therefore never changed my address on this account, so it still has me listed as living in the US.  I don't want to break the law or risk being fined, so this is not a route we've considered. However, I've read about people who opened Vanguard accounts while living in the US and then invested in them after moving abroad.

At the end they recieve the original PAR value of the bond (in our example it was $100). So there's a whole time value of money aspect as well.

390,DTE,"Margin is looked at within the totality of your account, across all positions. Your total assets are represented as your NLV (Net Liquidation Value; the value that you would receive if you were to close the account at any given time). 

Using your example, $100k shares fully funded on a margin account and no cash, and you buy $10k worth of options on margin. You now have a short cash position of $10k (meaning you're borrowing $10,000 from the brokerage). 

In most circumstances you would not be able to buy another $90k worth of options, nor would you want to. Doing that would create a short cash position of $100,000 (the original $10k borrowed and $90k from the next amount borrowed). 

As a worse case scenario, you're buying 0DTE options and you've got the direction wrong (e.g. stock goes down and you have calls or stock goes up and you have puts). What would happen in that scenario is that if your options lost 100% of their value, your position would be closed and your total account would be reduced by $100k. The $100k margin position is closed out and $100k worth of shares would be sold to cover the $100k that you've lost during the day on the options side. Your NLV is now $0. Depending on your brokerage, you *might* get a phone call as this is happening so that you can deposit money to prevent this from occurring. The brokerage is under no obligation to call you though, so please note that it's merely a courtesy if they do give you some extra time. If your shares also lost money during the day, you'd owe the brokerage whatever the difference is. 

Another important number here is your Excess Liquidity (EL). This is calculated during the day and tells you exactly how much of a cushion you have on your margin position. If your EL goes negative, you'll be liquidated. 

The other thing to factor in is that overnight margin requirements are higher than the requirements during the day. Both of these things will be contributing factors to the timing of your maintenance call. Additionally, if you have a portfolio margin account, the requirements are going to be different (typically you get higher tolerances beyond the Reg T rules on margin w/ a portfolio account). Margin accounts can be converted to Portfolio accounts at most brokerages if you have a 6-figure (or greater) balance.

Your margin loan isn't a separate liability. It's directly tied and influenced by the total asset value within your account. Your equity with loan value must always be greater than your current maintenance margin requirement.",0.048,0.849,0.103,0.9482

422,AMC,"I’m not touching AMC with a ten foot pole, but how exactly were theaters dead or dying? 2018 was one of the biggest years ever for box office takes, and 2019 was only a slight drawback. Box office sales have continually gone up over the last 20 years.

I think that certain theater models were less profitable, but I just don’t see how theaters as a business/market were already dead.
