Now for drug dealers they should def be careful about how they withdrawal the btc and where it goes after leaving the site but it’s like that w any currency. 

But really the main point is that something like PayPal or a bank absolutely wouldn’t allow any transactions for things like drugs on a dark web site which is the main reason it’s used. Yes idiots think it’s anon but the REAL criminals, like the ones actually selling things like drugs know what it is and how to use it. 

Back when I was 15 (I was stupid Ik) I used btc to buy drugs and u can v easily use anon wire transfers to send money over to reputable btc buyers n sellers if u find the right sites. That’s how I did it years ago b4 btc ATMs and without even owning a bank account.

As for the whole battery excuse you made: GM and Volkswagen will pay around 65$ to 75$ per kwh by 2024 where tesla will pay 50$. The difference may seem large but in reality its not. As for oil, the trillion dollar industry isn't going anywhere for atleast 40 years unfortunately. Oil is just so energy dense that there will be other uses for it.

2. A portfolio with a lesser variety compared to the one above, probably around 4/5 types of shares, meaning your equity is divided into those 4/5 different shares **OR**
3. A portfolio style that is not mentioned above

Okay I'm gonna be honest here - the reason for me asking this is because my portfolio is the one mentioned in the first case, and I feel that with that many different stocks, it's relatively harder for me to keep track of ALL the news, reports, analysis of the stocks as compared to a portfolio with fewer variety. I guess its safer in the first case?

My current aim is to have my portfolio provide a substantial passive income on the side whilst I focus on my education.

About 3 years ago I officially switched my permanent address with all my banks, etc. to my house here in England. My husband and I intend on going traveling (pandemic permitting!) in early 2022 for at least 6 months to a year. At this time we will give up the house we're renting and use either my parents' address in the US or his parents' address in the UK as our 'permanent' address. 

We've recently been gifted $30,000 and would like to invest that money in ETFs or mutual funds. We initially planned on doing so with Vanguard, but quickly discovered that this was not as straightforward as we originally thought because I'm no longer a US resident. I suppose one option is to delay investing for another year until we give up our UK address and switch to my parents', but that would mean a year without making any gains. However, I don't know if this is preferable over opting for some sort of international brokerage account.

Has anyone been in a similar position? Could you offer any advice?

As a final aside -- I've had a domestic account with Charles Schwab for nearly 10 years. However I never use it anymore and therefore never changed my address on this account, so it still has me listed as living in the US.  I don't want to break the law or risk being fined, so this is not a route we've considered. However, I've read about people who opened Vanguard accounts while living in the US and then invested in them after moving abroad.

At the end they recieve the original PAR value of the bond (in our example it was $100). So there's a whole time value of money aspect as well.

Using your example, $100k shares fully funded on a margin account and no cash, and you buy $10k worth of options on margin. You now have a short cash position of $10k (meaning you're borrowing $10,000 from the brokerage). 

In most circumstances you would not be able to buy another $90k worth of options, nor would you want to. Doing that would create a short cash position of $100,000 (the original $10k borrowed and $90k from the next amount borrowed). 

As a worse case scenario, you're buying 0DTE options and you've got the direction wrong (e.g. stock goes down and you have calls or stock goes up and you have puts). What would happen in that scenario is that if your options lost 100% of their value, your position would be closed and your total account would be reduced by $100k. The $100k margin position is closed out and $100k worth of shares would be sold to cover the $100k that you've lost during the day on the options side. Your NLV is now $0. Depending on your brokerage, you *might* get a phone call as this is happening so that you can deposit money to prevent this from occurring.

Guessing that you panic sold because you were over-extended. You didn't want to see your $70,000 go to $14,000 (or zero, if GME went under). The lesson to learn here is one about risk management. Likely, if you had 1,400 shares you would have kept them as it would have only been $7,000 (10%) of your invested money instead of all $70k. 1,400 shares are worth over $80k as of today, so not a bad return on your $7,000.

There will always be missed opportunities and if you're able to get your risk tolerance in order, you wont make the same mistake again.

397,ICLN,"I don’t believe in hydrogen becoming a big contender due to it‘s energy inefficiency but diversifying into all clean energy sectors is the right thing to do in my opinion. I also think that nuclear is underestimated but could ultimately fail for pure political reasons.

It’s sad to see Germany shutting down nuclear before coal and gas as they have now both one of the highest percentage of coal energy and the highest cost of energy in Europe. So they hurt the climate while producing expensive energy which hurts manufacturing and consumers and somehow think they are the leader in green energy and climate protection. Great mindbending there. Nuclear is cheap and doesn’t hurt the climate. Anxiety about accidents is in my opinion irrational since coal kills more people trough air pollution and even water has had bigger accidents than Tschernobyl like the 1975 Banqiao Dam failure that killed and estimated 100-250k people  yet nobody is scared of dams.

I wouldn’t put more than 10% of my portfolio into clean energy though.

Also to add to this: Remember that different clean energy sectors are better suited for different environments: 

Wind is amazing in areas with lots of wind like windfarms in Northern Europe, especially Scotland, Solar is amazing in countries with long and sunny days like Africa or California, hydogene might be useful for certain niches like Amazons forklifts that don’t pollute warehouses and can be used without charging time, water is amazing in countries with mountains like Austria (Verbund is a big holding in ICLN mainly producing energy with dams in Austria) and geothermal energy is awesome in countries with lots of volcanic activities like Iceland. (Guess why so much Aluminum is produced in Iceland, energy there is really cheap.)
