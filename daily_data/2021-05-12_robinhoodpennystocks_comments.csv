2,DD," If I have said it once I have said it 1000 times lately... DD means nothing fundamentals mean nothin financials mean NOTHING in today‚Äôs market!...  How do you hedge your portfolio against a shit market where up is down and down is up and Reddit memes and crypto with no tangible value or practical use are banking Billions.. you can do DD till your FKN eyes pop out and take every possible precaution and in the end nothing seems to matters but luck! 

But jokes on them I have a new trade strategy!..

Seeing ZOM right now at .85 is not making me sweat one bit. I was there when they dipped to 0.07 and still held. We shareholders will see in a year where ZOM and their product stands.

21,AP," Additionally to add, Xiaomi who went through this delisting legal drama for Chinese military companies, had previously won the preliminary injunction and now tonight, we found out the DoD is throwing in the towel! They officially won the case and shows that it won‚Äôt be dragged out in court! I am 99.9% sure this will follow to LKCO, who has already won the preliminary injunction. So shortly here, they will be in the clear of all the court and legal battle!

We had a rough day today, but rebounded quite well and recovered. The tech for this company is INSANE, autonomous vehicles, internet of things, smart cities. There is no possible way this should be sitting at 1.19. 

So anyway, give it a look and drop me some thoughts! ‚ù§Ô∏è

Additionally, I reached out to investor relations and asked about earnings dates and potential PR‚Äôs. Here was the response:

‚ÄúThanks for the email.  The short answer is yes, the next step for LKCO with the litigation and delisting concerns moving to the background is to report financials / begin to update the market on the operations and development of technology (along with utilization of capital).
 
We don‚Äôt have specific dates (to be fair we‚Äôre about 3 business days past the litigation ‚Äì which was sizable challenge).  But management is very aware of the expectations of being public and transitioning to explaining the development of the business vs. speaking with shareholders about the survival of the equity.

Thanks much

24,GBX," It gets talked about every single day here. RR PLC had a lot of share dilution and burned a ton of cash over the course of Covid. A majority of their income stream is wrapped up in service contracts for the Trent 900, which is only used in the Airbus A380. That plane was designed with the expectation that the commercial aviation sector would move to a hub and sprocket style of travel (ie, you take a small plane from a local airport to a large airport, large plane to another large airport, small plane to a local airport), but the industry actually moved to direct flights via narrow body aircraft capable of landing at regional airports- A380s are too big to use such airports. 

IMO RR's near term future relies on developing an engine platform suitable for narrow bodies, with an long term move *out* of the commercial aviation industry and into static power generation. The company is currently viable in the short term because they *do* still have lots of Trent 900 service contracts and lots of military contracts, and by their institutional nature in the UK, they are unlikely to fold completely. That said, I don't think the stock is currently undervalued. If you want to gamble that they'll have a massive recovery and sit on $RYCEY/$RR on GBX, have at it, but you'll be waiting a long time.",ItsYaBoyDonny1,10,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/naul8j/rolls_royce_why_is_no_one_talking_about_this/gxvoxld/,0.0,0.971,0.029,0.6652
