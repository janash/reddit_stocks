114,OVID,Yes OP did make a mistake. Closing out a loan account usually knocks your score down a few points if it’s an old loan because the average age of your credit accounts goes down. But the bigger mistake is not waiting until at least the 0% interest period expires considering they could have put that money to use elsewhere in the meantime not to mention the possibility of at least a chunk of it being forgiven due to COVID. On the other hand it probably feels good to be done with them.,0.047,0.786,0.167,0.9042
115,GME,"Yup. Good shit OP. Now it’s gone forever. 

You could defer mortgage payments here in Canada, which sounded great, but the details revealed they just tacked the deferred payments to the end of the loan, which will just end up costing you more in the long run, lol.

I’m not sure what the outcome will be from these loan payment deferments, but I’m with OP, just get rid of it. He’ll make another $25k on GME by the end of next week!",0.07,0.837,0.093,0.4852

3) There's no downside to waiting - he has til October to see how this goes

4) He has a million more options if the $23k is in his court - including paying off all of his student loans at once and posting it to r/wsb

126,GME,"Valid stance too, if OP is someone of the mindset where they’re like, “I already have 23k in student loans what’s another 10k on a car?” Then paying off all their debt might help them stay focused on not taking out more debt.

Of course I could've put it into stonks and really done well but hindsight is 20/20 and I'm pretty risk averse when it comes to paying off student loans.

You need to give up your prosperity, your relationships, any possibility of surviving and getting ahead - at least for a while - and sacrifice so you keep the elderly and vulnerable safe.

That's fine and good, most of us are okay to do that. So we do as it's the right thing to do. But then we get fucked - mostly by the wealthy, quite a lot who happen to be older - and in the mean time we get a small amount of government support, but we lose our jobs / dreams / etc. What do we have left?

For a lot of people this was their red pill moment, when they read about what has happened in the world, how shady all politicians are (some more than others, admittedly), how the wealthy and the money makers effectively collude and rig markets to bleed those of us who are too dumb or time poor to figure out it's all a scam.

Many people are finally coming to the realisation that in a financialized world there's no real logic in continuing to grind - for just basic survival - and that the world is rigged and not fair. A poor person hears of some information or coordinates to get ahead on the sharemarket (a market reserved usually for the wealthy because poor fuckers don't have spare money after food+housing+expenses) - well those poors who ""colluded"" to get ahead get the book thrown at them.

For example, if your account has $10B in equity and you are using $1B in margin to short GME, 20% of your $5B total margin (assuming your margin cap = 50% of your equity) is dedicated to GME.  

This means three things:  

1. You're paying interest on that $1B  
2. You're locked out of $1B worth of margin that could be invested elsewhere for better gains (i.e., additional opportunity cost)  
3. As the GME price goes up, the margin cost of it goes up.  

The third point is the key here. If the GME price is $20 and you spend $1B shorting it, you are short $1B/$20 = 50 million shares. If the price launches up to $100, you are still short 50 million shares, but they are now worth $5B instead of $1B, which means that you are now paying interest on $5B instead of $1B and it is eating at $5B worth of your margin instead of $1B worth of your margin (
AKA 100% of your margin).  

If GME then jumps to $120, your 50m shares are now worth $6B. But your margin cap is only $5B. This will cause a margin call. $1B of your $10B portfolio MUST be liquidated (or the broker will do it for you, to cover themselves). This means that your portfolio will now be worth $9B. The $1B that was liquidated will be put towards buying GME, which means that now you will only own the equivalent of $4B worth of GME (which, excluding the fact that GME would rise due to you buying it, is $4B/$120 = 333m shares (down from 500m).  

However, the fact is that the price WILL rise from you buying, which can force you to liquidate even more, etc.  

For this reason, no individual (including corporate ones) will use literally 100.0% of their margin in this manner. It would be suicidal. They will liquidate of their own accord BEFORE reaching that scary 100.0% margin cap and being fucked.  

However, the combination of many investors can synthetically achieve the same effect. As one gets dangerously close to being margin called, they start to liquidate shit so that they can buy back shares. This drives the price higher, spooking other investors into liquidating to do the same, which drives the price even higher.  

A small one then gets margin called, which is AWFUL for them. They're forced to buy everything at market value, launching up the price. But this probably won't cause a stock run-away on its own. They just don't have enough power.  

But they now need to recoup losses. How? They still have millions worth of value, and they know that a short squeeze is happening, so they put their value into going long to squeeze the BIGGER players, who are then forced to buy at market at even higher prices.  

That's the best case scenario (ISS). More likely, all parties involved scramble to cover enough shorts over time to lower their short interest, leading to a progressive increase of price over several weeks until they feel confident that their risk (their short interest compared to daily float) is sufficiently lowered. Then they can stop worrying about the market.  

The natural progression then is that profit-takers outweigh buyers (since the short squeeze is over and so that removes an entire segment of buyers). The price now starts falling. Gradually at first, more rapidly as paper hands start getting shook. The same companies see the stock price beginning to plummet, which causes the opposite effect as described earlier in their margins (i.e., the falling price means that their outlying shorts are a SMALLER % of their available margin). Coupling that with the falling stock price + their desire to recoup losses means that they can now short the stock to aid in its crash, shaking diamond hands and triggering stop losses.  

The end result is that the price ends up higher than it started (due to the adamantium hands), FAR lower than the squeeze, and the people who lost money are a combination of the hedge funds (whose after-the-fact shorting did not fully compensate for the margin called buying) and the adamantium hands who bought high and never sold.  

The adamantium hands people will be a mix of sad bagholders who will feel betrayed by WSB and people like DFV who don't give a fuck about the squeeze and believe in a non-meme $420 GME in 1-2 years. They'll all get a happy ending if his bull thesis is correct, just on a longer timeframe.  

The saddest group will be the one that shows up late as fuck (""IT'S $200, IS THAT TOO LATE?""), gets memed into joining (""THE ROCKET NEEDS A REFUEL!!!""), watches as the price caps at $420.69 or whatever, doesn't sell, watches as the price falls through $400, doesn't sell, watches as the price falls through $200, doesn't sell, watches as the price settles back to $80, doesn't sell, asks in WSB where everyone went, and everyone goes ""to $BB dipshit."" In their anger they pull out of GME at a 60% loss instead of waiting it out true adamantium-hands style like DFV and then decide ""WSB isn't for me"" as they go back to r/investing and put all their cash into super shitty bonds or something for 4% YoY returns.",0.109,0.778,0.112,-0.8496

People forget that in order to profit you have to actually sell during the squeeze. If you convince enough people to set a stupid sell price like 1,000x, you make lower sell points more comfortable for yourself.

Anyone saying 1000x is likely planning to sell under 1000$ and leave you holding the bag once the shorts are covered.

Hodling GME is a great idea. Short Squeeze is a real thing with examples of it happening previously to other stocks eg Volkswagon. Short Squeeze is also temporary and WILL have a point where it tops out. People are posting meme prices of 4206.94 or 6942.00 because when the sell comes, **they are competing with you for the short's business**.

Set your price as you will. Keep it to yourself. Don't trust anything over $1000 unless you actually know how to make sense of the numbers. Below that, it's a shitshow but there's enough gravy to go around for most, I would guess.",0.048,0.88,0.072,0.6118

869,EB,"You all know I’m a strategist, so here’s the ultimate virtuous cycle. Everyone wins except the bad guys still lose. The ultimate Power to the Players, A GameStop Story.

Players can buy various gift cards @ their local GameStop, EB Games, Micromania, et al, in whatever tendies donomination they can afford: $50, $500, $5,000+ if you’re a u/DeepFuckingValue level Pro, all while using your free $5 per month PowerUp Pro membership credit (sign up here if you haven’t yet: https://www.gamestop.com/poweruprewards/). If you don’t have one locally, consider teaming up online with another Player who does, it’s super effective! 

In-store, ask each member of the local GameStop/et al’s staff (and ask about how many employees there are, full & part time) what their preferred gift card of choice (dining, retail, etc.) is and buy the whole team a positively life impacting gift with your donated tendies. You get points, they’re team tendies, the company makes a couple bucks. Win-win. Let’s share the retail market players’ golden delights with the people that have been on the front lines—underpaid retail staff doing their best to provide for their families & selves. 

Fair market value is higher, see our research at GMEDD.com Power to the Players.

Shorts would use their uPnL on their positions to sell puts and intentionally drive prices up by covering, only to stop just short of important strikes, where they would have ominously placed sell orders ( additional shorts ), they bought back their put positions for pennies, which they would then turn around and use to further pressure the price of GME.

Back then the books were so thin a 100k buy order would net 7-10% gain in price

\*buys back puts\*

\*slam the same 100k into a sell order\*

price right back where it started, use profit to drive the price down further - it was fucking disgusting.

With how much mainstream attention this is starting to get, money that has never been anywhere near the stock market before is starting to flow in to this. On top of that, new fucking morons keep lining up to short again the moment someone else covers (seriously, look at $GME on Stocktwits and Twitter. The number of people on there who are foaming at the mouth to short GME because think they are smarter than everyone else is insane).

I used to laugh at the $1,000 price targets, but you know what, we are beginning to enter completely uncharted territory here.  VW had a crazy restriction on the float which greatly contributed to its infinity squeeze, but it didn't have the mainstream hype and attention that this does.

Nothing like this has ever happened before, and I honestly think it's possible that this whole situation has gotten so explosive that it could end up turning into something beyond what even the most delusionally optimistic predictions have been saying.

It's a perfect storm and traditional schools of thought on this shit could be about to fly completely out the window. Strap the fuck in and rethink your $1,000 limit sells imo.",0.094,0.819,0.087,-0.5775

Don't be afraid. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to make some serious $$$$. There will be a Wiki page about this and a movie. Mark my words.

Buy in because this stock can rise to $1k easily and very quickly. Godspeed and make sure you set your sell minimums to $1k. We will create a sell wall that the shorters will have to pay.

What’s happening: 

Smooth brains(hedge funds) borrowed than lent out too many shares. More shares borrowed than exist. Smooth brains must now give shares back. Not enough shares to buy to give back. 

Enter WSB:

We buy shares and 💎🙌. 
Smooth brains still need to cover. We say $1000 a share please. We wait until they cave in. 


Things to remember:
Nobody knows how long this is going to last. Nobody knows if the squeeze will actually happen(98% chance it does though). Nobody knows for sure how high the price will get. In order for this to work you must have 💎🙌. 
Don’t buy calls, don’t buy puts, DONT BUY SHARES ON MARGIN. Turn off margin or else your shares can be lent out. ONLY BUY SHARES.

What’s happening: 

Smooth brains(hedge funds) borrowed than lent out too many shares. More shares borrowed than exist. Smooth brains must now give shares back. Not enough shares to buy to give back. 

Enter WSB:

We buy shares and 💎🙌. 
Smooth brains still need to cover. We say $1000 a share please. We wait until they cave in. 


Things to remember:
Nobody knows how long this is going to last. Nobody knows if the squeeze will actually happen(98% chance it does though). Nobody knows for sure how high the price will get. In order for this to work you must have 💎🙌. 
Don’t buy calls, don’t buy puts, DONT BUY SHARES ON MARGIN. Turn off margin or else your shares can be lent out. ONLY BUY SHARES.

SEC would first have to investigate how more than the outstanding amount of shares was able to be shorted, and the options manipulation that took place from Jul 2019 - Aug 2020

Shorts would use their uPnL on their positions to sell puts and intentionally drive prices up by covering, only to stop just short of important strikes, where they would have ominously placed sell orders ( additional shorts ), they bought back their put positions for pennies, which they would then turn around and use to further pressure the price of GME.

Back then the books were so thin a 100k buy order would net 7-10% gain in price

\*buys back puts\*

\*slam the same 100k into a sell order\*

So one of the interesting things that happened yesterday with that Gamma squeeze is that it revealed....the sellers had largely given up (this is important, I promise)


Yesterday morning, there was a large sell wall at 49.50 that I did NOT think $GME was going to be able break through.  So much so that I actually opened a short position at 49.27 in anticipation of bouncing off of it and falling to 45.


That sell wall wasn't defeated, but the entity that put it in place removed it, which is why the stock blew right through and didn't slow down again until about 52.  The important thing, though, was that the next sell wall?  Wasn't until EIGHTY FIVE.  I've never closed a short position so quickly in my life.  The moment I saw it at 50.58 I knew there was no resistance at all and I took my loss immediately.


The removal of that wall was a total capitulation by sellers, who waved the white flag.  Had it not been for the circuit breakers, $GME would have ABSOLUTELY gotten over 100 yesterday.  The only reason it closed as low as it did yesterday was because retail investors aren't used to seeing circuit breakers.  They don't understand them or why they're in place.  So it scared them.  Because why wouldn't it be scary when a stock stops trading?  That gave people who weren't even really looking at GME a few minutes to prepare to open large short positions, which is why you saw the stock absolutely plummet after the 2nd breaker - so much so that it triggered a downside breaker.    But if you look at the sell-side during that downswing, it was all tiny sell orders.  50 shares here, 100 shares there, some 20's, etc.  It was  🧻🤚 running for the hills because they didn't understand what was happening.  So even after that 2nd breaker, there was no real conviction on the sell side.  Which is why the stock was able to rebound to 65 from 57.


This is all a very long TL:DR of saying everybody keeps saying 420.69 as a joke, but....I wouldn't laugh if I were you, because when these squeezes and margin calls happen, there's absolutely no sell conviction to keep the price from skyrocketing.

The important thing, though, was that the next sell wall?  Wasn't until EIGHTY FIVE.  I've never closed a short position so quickly in my life.  The moment I saw it at 50.58 I knew there was no resistance at all and I took my loss immediately.


The removal of that wall was a total capitulation by sellers, who waved the white flag.  Had it not been for the circuit breakers, $GME would have ABSOLUTELY gotten over 100 yesterday.  The only reason it closed as low as it did yesterday was because retail investors aren't used to seeing circuit breakers.  They don't understand them or why they're in place.  So it scared them.  Because why wouldn't it be scary when a stock stops trading?  That gave people who weren't even really looking at GME a few minutes to prepare to open large short positions, which is why you saw the stock absolutely plummet after the 2nd breaker - so much so that it triggered a downside breaker.    But if you look at the sell-side during that downswing, it was all tiny sell orders.  50 shares here, 100 shares there, some 20's, etc.  It was  🧻🤚 running for the hills because they didn't understand what was happening.  So even after that 2nd breaker, there was no real conviction on the sell side.  Which is why the stock was able to rebound to 65 from 57.


This is all a very long TL:DR of saying everybody keeps saying 420.69 as a joke, but....I wouldn't laugh if I were you, because when these squeezes and margin calls happen, there's absolutely no sell conviction to keep the price from skyrocketing.  And every time it happens, it creates a higher low.",0.076,0.868,0.056,-0.8734

When a big stockholder sells, the stock price will go up creating even more pressure on those who still bet against GME because it becomes increasingly expensive to do so.

# Context

What happened last week with GME stock price and option was a combination of a gamma squeeze \[1\] and infinite short squeeze \[2\]. For the first time in financial history all GME call options are in the money (ITM) because the highest call strike price set by the CBOE for Januaray 29, 2021 is $60.

**Note:** A primer on gamma squeeze:

h[ttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2t9bf/gme\_i\_think\_this\_is\_a\_gamma\_squeeze\_where\_dealers/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2t9bf/gme_i_think_this_is_a_gamma_squeeze_where_dealers/)

Market Maker \[1\] are in a condition never observed in financial history. Hundred of thousands of retail (wsb) are buying the GME 60C across the options calendar and MM can't hedge properly because there are not enough GME shares to buy to properly financially hedge (accounting for the interest rate to borrow)

# Market Structure

To summarize the market structure:

1. Few GME shares to hedge.
2. Hundreds of thousands of (wsb) are buying the GME 60C because of the infinite short squeeze.
3. January 29, 2021 60C call option are the highest one on the option change for that date.
4. Conditions for Infinite Gamma Squeeze & Infinite Short Squeeze

As you may now realize --(MM and brokers) hope you don't -- there is a gap in the market structure that leaves them (MM/Citadel) vulnerable to massive losses.

# Infinite Gamma Squeeze

***Should*** **million of retails (wsb) buy the Januray 29, 2021 60C weekly on Monday, this will create an infinite gamma squeeze because MM still can't properly hedge, and are forced to buy shares at whatever price to hedge. MM doing so, forces brokers to margin call the shorts caught in their infinite short squeeze. Both conditions are pro-cyclical and feed on each other in an infinite feedback loop** ***so long as more an more retails buy the GME 60C.***

There is a chance that MM can dump the shares they bought to hedged the gamma steepening and call buying \[1\]. However, doing so does not make them market neutral. It effectively turns MM into a hedge fund. SEC may allow them to get away from this momentarily.

**However, after the MM dump shares in an attempt to stop the infinite gamma squeeze they will be net short GME shares and unhedged/not market neutral.** If after the MM dump, retails continue to buy GME shares up to the $60 price, MM will be caught in a *exponentially worse gamma squeeze*, which should GME go pass 60C (gamma bump) on the week of January 25, it would turn into the one of biggest tail risk event for the MM/Citidal.

**tldr;**

**There is a gap in the market structure so that if millions of retails buy Januray 29 GME 60C on January 25 2021, there is a high probability of both an infinite gamma and short squeeze. This has never happened in financial history. And should millions of retail buy the January 29 GME60C 2021, the losses for MM but profits for retail will be massive. Retails could see 100000% return on their weekly GME Januray 29 call options at the highest strike price.**

**Edit1:** Apparently there may be higher call prices for the January 29 2021 option chains. Fundamentally, this analysis is still correct. Should millions of retail all choose a common higher call strike price to buy (higher than 60C), the gamma squeeze will be triggered when that prices is hit.

Example:

Should millions of retail buy the January 29 70C or January 29 75C, and the infinite short squeeze continues. If the GME 70C or 75C is hit, GME share price enters a gamma squeeze.

What the MM are hoping for are twofolds:

1. They scare retails to sell below $60. This alleviates the infinite gamma squeeze. Or;
2. Retails don't all buy the same call options. But given that wsb loves high risk, I hypothesize they will all choose the furthest OTM call options.

GME at 60 is the Maginot line next week. Should it go to 75, gamma and infinite short squeeze continues. Should it fall below it, MM have won a strategic victory.

**Edit2:**

For gamma squeeze, you look at the open interest (OI) and strike price. Should the share price get close to the price with a highest open interest, that's when the gamma steepening occurs as probability goes to 1. MM have to buy shares to remain neutral as the options are now ITM.

The BB brand: I give it a solid B+. The biggest miss? They’re hiding the fucking headline. Why does this matter to us? 2 million subscribers. Let’s help them out. Build the brand. Build the business. Ride this to the moon.

Some words for Mark Wilson, their CMO:

Stop pussyfooting around the fact that you’re BlackBerry. Believe, motherfucker, believe. I’ve worked with dozens of your competitors – and you sound every other one of them. You’re not.

Try this on for size:

We believe in the battle hard-won.

The good fight.

The toughness of mind, quickness of wit, and clarity of heart that can only be earned.

Earned through taking a hit, going down, getting back up, feet planted, fists raised, ready for another furious round.

We can get them here with a couple of brokers (search the UK investing sub for a while to find them), specifically US brokers who operate here.

Right now most people are buying stocks because they help with the short squeeze. The massive gains you see are likely call options though (‘calls’ are bets that the stock will go up, ‘puts’ are bets that they’ll go down).

If you see people talking about GME 1/27 100c, for example, those are calls that GME will hit 100 by 27th of January (stupid America dating system). 

Options are way riskier than stocks as you can lose literally everything when they expire, but much more earning potential. I’ve given you a simplified explanation though, and much more goes into it. YouTube should be of some help!

You can agree with someone to buy 1000 shares of Initech stock for $110 each on friday (Ie, that's an option to buy). They set a price for this option, let's say you pay them $5000.  
If the stock hasnt gone up over $110 on friday your option is now worthless (you dont need to use it, because if you did you'd have to pay more per stock than it's worth).  
But if the stock is worth $125 then you can use the option, buy for $110k and immediately sell for $125k, making a profit of $15k minus the $5k you paid for the option.  
Of course in this scenario you could also just have bought stocks for $100 on monday and sold for $125k on friday.  
But if the price goes down, in the case of the option you're only down the price of the option, but if you bought stocks you can potentially lose any amount, eg if the stock nosedives to $50 before you decide to sell then you  lost a full $50k.

If you have any sort of federal income tax withholding, then you're giving the IRS what you think you'll owe from each paycheck (withholding).  When you file your tax return at the end of the year, you figure out what you actually owe, compare it to what your estimated payments (withholding) was, and then either pay the difference or get paid the extra.

I like the trade, but the DD from McKenzy is weak af, the whole article is a sell.

What’s legit... 5G autonomous vehicles will need high speed connectivity to work properly. Over the air updates are HUGE data piles, require a strong and fast connection to download properly. Vehicle location and roadside assistance can be done with less than a 3g signal, that’s what all current manufacturers use because it’s simple and cheap. 

What’s bullshit....  No one is shopping in their fucking car! You know what they are gonna use when their car is driving itself??? Their fucking phone!!! Customers won’t pay $500 a year for shit they don’t use!!! Ask how many people don’t pay for Satellite radio for $70 a year after the trial is up? 

To think that BlackBerry knows anything about integrated systems in cars is a fucking PIPE dream. When BMW release the 2002 745i, do you know how many computers could be in that car? 72!!!! 5 types of bus systems, 2 fiber optic systems and more. Since then they have simplified and combined systems but they come from all different manufacturers. Just look at the parts sourcing from these cars.... here’s how the software works, they are simplified into systems.
Drivetrain, infotainment, safety and let’s call it other electronic body systems. Blackberry has ZERO experience in cars! 

If they were lucky to score infotainment or telematics, one would ask what have they done lately? NOTHING other than troll patents. 

The bottom line is people won’t pay for the service connectivity that Blackberry thinks they can sell along with whatever User Interface they come up with. The name BlackBerry will never be shown in a vehicle, but Apple CarPlay will because they are still relevant.

Everyone seems stuck on the belief that :

1.  WSB won’t sell
2.  Short interest has to fall

Both are false and let me explain.   GME has roughly 70,000,000 shares outstanding.   27% are held by insiders and another chunk are held by passive ETFs so the real tradable float is probably something like 40,000,000 shares.  

Today 195,000,000 shares traded!  That’s every tradable share trading around 5x - so get the illusion out of your head that this group is hoarding all the shares and not selling - all longs, institutional, hedge funds, WSB, and more are clearly trading.  

So what’s going on?   

1.  I’d say that some of the active managers (institutional) are starting to sell.  They won’t be eager to help the shorts, but they will be eager to start taking chips off the table on a stock that’s flashing red on their screens as a “rich” stock.  

2.  Insiders are selling.   We won’t see that until later but surely, it’s happening

3.  Retail selling.  If i owned this at $10 cost, I’d keep a long but definitely reduce my position.   Live to fight another day.   

So what about the shorts?  So everyone is waiting for short interest to fall as a signal that WSB won.   It MIGHT NOT FALL.   As the price goes higher, just like the long shares are circulating to new hands, the shorts probably are too.  Some options expired today (synthetic shorts), others triggered stop losses.   Some just gave up on something that was 1% of their portfolio - moving on.  But when they cover, there are SURELY new shorts coming in at these new high prices. They will probably be much less bothered by an $80-$100 open on Monday that someone short at $20!  

So the point being, this hasn’t been an overnight short squeeze like VW or APRN.  This has been a slow process with LOTS of time for longs to adjust their risk, and shorts to adjust theirs.  I’m not suggesting that some shorts aren’t getting ruined, they are, I’m just saying you probably never see the short covering ripfest you think you will, because some of these shorts probably have new and deep pockets.   And the further this gets bought up, the richer an asset we own, the further from intrinsic value and the more the downside when the trade cracks.

So the point being, this hasn’t been an overnight short squeeze like VW or APRN.  This has been a slow process with LOTS of time for longs to adjust their risk, and shorts to adjust theirs.  I’m not suggesting that some shorts aren’t getting ruined, they are, I’m just saying you probably never see the short covering ripfest you think you will, because some of these shorts probably have new and deep pockets.   And the further this gets bought up, the richer an asset we own, the further from intrinsic value and the more the downside when the trade cracks.

I was talking to a buddy of mine regarding the price mechanics of GME in a MOASS situation. There comes a point in a face-ripping short-squeeze, where price ceases to matter, and where we begin to speak in multiples or percentages/ratios.

The math is there to back it up, given the correct assumptions (see my Price Target post, link in the post.)

Nobody knows. There are many unknown unknowns at play. Best we can do is watch how it progresses every day.

Lastly, I wouldn't be shocked, on the basis of technical price movement (eg. short covering and  >100% SI) and compounding math, if it reaches $250+ $500+ $1000+. On the basis of logic, no surprise. On the basis of emotion, I'd be mind-blown.

1852,OR,"“Hold for a little while” no. This is not a super safe, walk away from your desk type of deal. People are optimistic that the company could pull off a pivot of their business model and have a future, yes, but that’s less certain than the fact that shorts have to close their positions or face mounting pressure ($) to keep them. That is what we’re all playing - the short squeeze. Some people say it could last days or weeks, but it’s about timing it, so most people are setting limit sells for theirs shares to strike in the high hundreds. $1000 share, who knows, but I staggered my limit sells to get gains at multiple levels if it goes that high (price will be super volatile and selling the stock manually via market sell at $745.23 one second could execute at $620.89 the next, and could then go to 850 a minute later (random numbers)). I’ve also kept some shares uncommitted to limit sells just in case it goes into another galaxy (ex. $5000 share) OR holding onto a few for the long term (see: business model pivot). I suggest spending your weekend looking at the various DDs if you want to play it.

1889,GME,"Think of it like this.

You get a margin call, which means you need to either put up more cash (by selling other assets) or they make you buy back the stock.

For a small short of say 500 shares, trying to buy 500 shares all at once doesn't impact the market at all.

But try buying 500,000 share all at once, well, better hope there are lots of shares available to buy. Otherwise, the price goes up SUPER fast (as we saw today around 12;30)

And that is the beauty of this short squeeze (even though I have paper hands), is that no matter what, there are not enough shares available to close out their short positions.

So, it will collapse like dominoes, as each short is forced to cover, that raises the price. Which then can force ANOTHER short to cover, further increasing the price. 

BUT, just because the price hits $1000 a share doesn't mean it is going to stay there.

So, this will end when Melvin or whoever else is short, goes bankrupt / surrenders their short positions. 

(you can see they have been covering this week, by the slow boiling up of the price). 

Now, next week, that is going to be the week the shorts break. 

Why, because now EVERYONE has heard about GME and the trapped shorts (102% of available shares are shorted). So come Monday, expect a big jump (I bailed today, and have some regrets, but I expect to get back in).

So, what you would want to do, if you are serious about this, is set a sell price at, say $420.68 (which is below the 420.69 everyone else has set). So when the short squeeze happens, you close out your position and don't have to ride that rollercoaster back down.",0.043,0.867,0.089,0.8092

I have a degree in Computer Science,  I’ve engineered systems that run on Windows, Unix, Linux, containers using Docker and Kubernetes.  Open source software will always have more known vulnerabilities because the code base is easily viewed.  Many people with diverse engineering backgrounds can view that code.  This leads to more vulnerabilities being found, but also to more of those vulnerabilities being fixed, and fixed faster than closed source operating systems.

There’s a reason why Black Hat hackers love to take advantage of organizations that use windows.  It’s not that Linux is impossible to hack but exploiting windows is easier by an order of magnitude.  Those people that hack for profit usually take the path of least resistance to profit.

As of macOS Catalina Apple removed all old NeXTSTEP(based on BSD Unix 4.4) code and the OS is now entirely based on FreeBSD Unix with some Apple custom written code on top of it.

FreeBSD is an entirely open source operating system.  It has many contributors but not as many as Linux and is not as popular, it is still considered more secure by miles than the windows kernel.

Windows makes some very stupid architectural decisions when it comes to security.  Couple that with the performance of the windows kernel  vs the Linux kernel and you now know why most cloud providers exclusively offer Linux.

Microsoft relies on “capturing” your business and making it difficult to use other technologies as integrating with a Microsoft ecosystem is more opaque than say integrating Linux systems with FreeBSD.  Hell even the majority of Azure Cloud instances are running some kind of linux.

Integration is the name of the game in tech the tech world at the moment.  Any company not moving to the cloud and away from Microsoft is frankly behind the curve.

How does this relate to blackberry?  Blackberry devices use two operating systems Blackberry 10 and Android.  Blackberry 10 Based on QNX shown in this chart had its last release three years ago in April and the company has moved to android as of 2019.  Like Microsoft and their Azure Cloud Platform  Blackberry sees that custom homegrown closed source operating systems are dying.  I have a feeling that before the end of the decade Microsoft Windows will either be defunct or will no longer use the closed source NT kernel and be a distribution of Linux or based on some kind of Unix.

Tech companies are seeing the writing on the wall folks the open source operating system revolution isn’t just a passing fad but a trend that’s been on the rise for years.  Don’t bet on the losers folks, bet on where the tech industry is innovating, open source software and platforms.

30 years ago your car was not going to get hacked. Today it is totally possible.

The market potential for a highly secure OS is astronomical. You may not remember this but I’m old enough to remember (and Pepperidge Farm remembers) when BlackBerry was the go-to phone for corporate types and government folks that required a secure phone.

Additionally, the cost of living in CA is far higher than Idaho. I'm not just talking rent. Everything. Electricity, water, sales tax, state cap gains tax (if any), food, etc.  

You're right. You'd end up with more cash in CA still. After factoring in federal income tax, food, etc, the Idaho person might have around $40k laying around in disposable income, while the Californian person might have around $60k laying around in disposable income.  

I'm not going to trivialize a +50% increase of disposable income, but I AM going to say that a Californian guy is probably working a lot more hours per day in a much more competitive job. On the upside, the guy at FB has a LOT of room for growth into positions that are like $300k+ per year with time.

We here all know this is absolute bullshit, that any such regulation would be because we made institutional money look bad. If anything, WSB is most analogous to an old-school self-directed investment club, which the SEC has given the green light to for decades: https://www.sec.gov/reportspubs/investor-publications/investorpubsinvclubhtm.html

The other two that sold some still have a good amount left.

But yeah, always selling to zero shares seems a bit odd as a CFO no? But since he always does this it's probably not a bad sign at all. Maybe he just doesn't like to hold shares as the financial officer, but is this a common occurrence? Just wondering why head finance honcho don't want any.

So when you reap in those tasty tendies and later realize that you made too much taxable income,  you will have to pull the excess contribution out ALONG with the gains, get taxed on that income and incur an additional tax penalty for being a tard.

I had a similar situation and was able to catch it quick.  I contributed 3k in early 2020.  I usually only do half in the beginning of the year in case I make too much.  Earlier this month I made a 3k 2021 contribution.  I have GME in taxable accounts and my ROTH.  My gains in the taxable accounts already disqualify me from a ROTH contribution.  Fortunately I was able to have my broker switch the 2021 contribution to a 2020 contribution bringing me to the 6000 max.

So let’s say you contribute $5k every year in January. Like a good autist you like round numbers. Then, “Oh shit, GME gonna make me rich.” You can reallocate $1k to 2020 (remember you only committed $5 of $6k that year), this would max out that year and leaving you a $4k remaining balance. I believe you then can push that into 2022 come this time next year. Then cross fingers and hope you stay poor or something so you can continue to contribute to your ROTH.

You're correct. Unlucky-Prize is a paid shill. Been following him for a while.

""Unluck-prize is all like ""People don't pay enough attention to me and I get  downvoted, must be tribalism!"", ""WSB content is shit (shocking!) my  analysis is great, witness me!"".

Questions is why does this guy care so much and why he produces so much content on GME.

One  can come to a logical conclusion he's either an average trader with  superiority complex (which is fine) or a paid shill. His first post are  full of manipulative, fearmongering hyperbolic expressions in every  paragraph. When I called him out he adapted and changed the tone of his  messaging.

In his tribalism post  he's in essence complaining about not having enough influence over WSB  crowd. Really mate? Why would you fucking care? Do you get a bonus for a  number of upvotes or what?

If you dig deeper in his comments (just a few examples from memory) it's full of stuff like:

\-> Cohen is a founder, not a CEO - bearish

\-> Sherman is great - still bearish

\-> Uberkikz (Rod Alzmann ) and others DD posters not even amateurs, their DD sucks - bearish

\-> Institutional investors are not buying GME - bearish

\-> Price action is just a gamma squeeze - bearish

\-> Price action last week is just WSB buying- bearish

\-> there will be a MM catastrophic selling event (had little impact) - bearish

\-> MOASS is impossible - bearish

\-> shorts already covered - bearish

\-> Citron knows shorting and is legit - bearish

\-> We don't know if Melvin is really shorting - bearish

My guess is that all the market makers know this is coming and won't be 100% hedged, because they expect a gamma unwinding to happen almost certainly.  So you might not even see as big a gamma squeeze as you would normally expect.

Now, the interim hypothetical mid week squeeze *might* be enough to get some smaller hedge funds margin called on their shorts.  But, the big guys are going to ride it out.

12 months ago, you made a truly retarded and life-altering decision, on the basis of gut feelings and autism so pure if it was cocaine it’d kill.

But it was a decision so autistic you’ve breached the savant category and have treaded into u/DeepFuckingValue waters.

**Here’s a list of what to do now if you don’t know already or if you don’t already have a plan:**

1. Pay off debt.

2. Stash as much in retirement accounts as you can. Max 2 Roth IRAs for 2021, 2022, and 2023 if possible. Max your 401k at $19,000 for 2022, and do it again in 2023.

3. Invest the rest in index funds in a taxable brokerage account.

4. Use part of it as down payment on property.

5. Put some in savings for the possible education expenses.

6. Follow the steps and the flow chart in the wiki on the sidebar: “PRIME DIRECTIVE: How to handle $”.

7. Optional: Donate some to me. A stranger. 
Someone who you have never met, just out of the good in your heart, if there is any. ( 🤷‍♂️ Worth a try)

3726,DD,"Not directed at OP just my comments for general discussion:  


I think your exit strategy should really be built around what it is you are looking to get out of this play.

I bought 40 shares at 38.50 for a total cost of $1540. For me this is a pretty low cost play representing a really small portion of my overall portfolio. I mainly did it because I read a lot of the DD and thought the prospect of a short squeeze was interesting, I had the cash available, and I wanted to experience the excitement of the short squeeze as it happened.

As a result I set my sell limit at 1000. I don't have enough invested in GME to make a life changing amount of money, so I figured why not set my limit at something really ridiculously high like $1000. If it hits and I make 38600 profit that's really cool. If it doesn't and collapses back down and I sell at the same price I bought it at. I net 0 and got to have fun participating in a very rare market event.  


If I had an amount invested in GME that would actually be meaningfully life changing in some way I would set my sell limit at whatever that life changing number was. This will be different for everyone. For some people a life changing amount of money is being able to put a down payment on a house, for others it's not needing to worry about how they are going to pay rent for the next 6 months.

maybe 200b might be a bit too much today but if this stock gets more traction and people start to believe that it will be the next tesla while the fed keeps the money printer going then ending 2023 with 200B is not that far fetched

 The short interest was 13%. GME is estimated to be 138%. I believe it will take the shorts a week or more to cover their shorts. Squeezes don't happen in a day or two so you won't miss something big enough to make you FOMO. Not as much if you sell 10% at 100 and it goes to 1k.

First of all, is this link dated 12/8/2020 relevant to the anticipated GME offering? 🚀 🚀

Second of all, one of the major fears is that a GME stock offering will tank the market price, but I am anticipating them to do so at prices upwards of $300-- this is theoretically infinite, after all, and our hands are made of diamond.

based on the 100mil cap, that is at most 300k shares... which is NOTHING compared to short float! 🚀 🚀 🚀 significantly more shorts left on friday already (I think? so fucking hard to find info on that)

BUT 100mil is only 1/5 of their debt... I guess they fucked up with this planned offering and didnt expect such astronomical heights, heights made possibly by our sexy diamond hands. 🚀 🚀 🚀

Someone explain to me why im wrong and shouldnt be even more bullish than ever.

ALSO I added 1k to my robinhood (yes ik this is low iq) and its currently being transferred. theres no risk of weird margin backfirings if i just yolo that 1k of instant deposits into GME stonk, right?

Retail investors own so many less shares than corporations. This is a corporate battle and the only reason retail investors are getting media coverage is because there are significantly more retail investors than usual on this trade vs. other trades. The reality is, I am a retail investor following some stranger's quality due diligence (with regard to Ryan Cohen, short volume, and historical data like VW 2008), and there is no universally agreed upon sale price, and any weight that WSB is exerting on this trade is minimal compared to institutional money.

What I see in this text is 1. an attempt to blame the whole fiasco on retail investors and escape corporate responsibility, and 2. people that don't understand the fervor for video games trying to temper the market. And to them I say: I bought the dip and you can too.

I am an unemployed student and I am better off than the majority of retail investors. I own 172 shares at an average cost of 41.18, and sale price of 420.69 is peanut money compared to what corporations will earn and compared to what I plan to sell at. I am fully leveraged, using my rent money and a credit card advance. Retail investors have zero control over the market; we are just lucky enough to have caught the sewer tsunami.

3835,PLTR,"**History Refresher:**
Today, WSB falls under its greatest scrutiny, most of which can be attributed to the chagrin of a few large institutional opponents. So, let’s pause for a moment and reflect upon a time not too long ago when another online safe-house slid into similar cross-hairs.  

Let’s start with PLTR. Many of you homophobic retards are too young to remember, but wayyy back in 2016 PLTR’s cofounder *Peter Thiel* quietly bankrolled litigation against an online news forum called Gawker. These law suits tackled [sex tapes, Hulk Hogan, and other random salacious shit](https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattdrange/2016/06/21/peter-thiels-war-on-gawker-a-timeline/), but nothing related to the PLTR cofounder himself?  *So, why did Thiel finance the legal attack against Gawker?* To find the answer, we must go back a decade earlier when Gawker ran a story under the headline “Peter Thiel is totally gay, people.” Gawker outted Thiel. Thiel exacted his petty revenge, as all feisty gays will do.

As history would have it, those lawsuits ultimately shut Gawker down. And today, a half decade later, Gawker has not reassembled in any similar fashion. There is a void. Thiel won, Gawker lost, never mind the truth... Thiel **is** gay. *And that’s okay!* Well, at least outside WSB it is.

Anyways, y’all be careful with the jovial gay-bashing right now. It’s unethical, but that reasoning falls on deaf ears here. So if that doesn’t resonate, then study the day a butthurt Thiel rage-fucked Gawker into oblivion. Your opponents will jump at the earliest opportunity to serve you a coup de gras with a side of virtue-signaling.

TL;DR -
WSB is to Gawker, as Left is to Thiel",0.087,0.838,0.075,-0.5502

But this would only be true if there was an exactly 50:50 split of short sellers and non-short sellers! Typically shorts are much less than 50%, and therefore in the vast majority of cases more people profit from the increase in stock than lose, i.e. it's not a zero sum game. When shorts are more than 50%, more people profit from the decrease in stock, i.e. still not a zero sum game.

>my point is new wealth cannot come out of thin air

You have a very poor understanding of what wealth is, and zero understanding of economics. If I chopped down a tree and built a cross-bow with it and then sold it - I've generated wealth for myself out of thin air. The same concept works for companies - companies can work to innovate, develop products, and then sell them. This increases revenue and therefore increase the price of shares, generating wealth. No one else loses as a result of this economic activity, i.e. it's still not a zero sum game.

It's an easy bet when you believe in them and their product, and you hold a strong conviction that insiders recognize the upside and will do relatively limited profit taking.

You don’t think profit taking is then being turned around into buying more shares and swing trading?

100% it is.

As long as profits keep going up, the amount of money to keep reinvesting is endless.

If PLTR and BB both start printing up heavily, I don’t think they will, but if they do - rinse and repeat.

This could literally turn into a new wave of investing where finally the internet can become its own hedge fund.",0.0,0.935,0.065,0.6132

They have dozens of partnerships with automakers and Amazon and by 2023 will be the dominant player in vehicular data which will be worth major billions. They also have a robust cybersecurity biz, and patent licensing.  Ridiculously undervalued all the way to $100 IMO, and i'm not exaggerating.",0.084,0.799,0.117,0.3661
