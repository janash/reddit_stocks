7,NI," **Lithium continues to be the key component in the manufacturing of rechargeable batteries, which are used in a wide range of devices such as smartphones, laptops, electric vehicles, and renewable energy storage systems. As the demand for these products continues to grow, so does the demand for lithium.**  
The largest producers of lithium are Australia, Chile, and Argentina, which collectively account for more than 75% of global production. Other significant producers include China and the United States.  
It's worth noting that the lithium market can be volatile and subject to fluctuations based on factors such as supply and demand, technological advancements, and government policies.

**ACME Lithium Inc. (CSE: ACME) (OTCQX: ACLHF)** is pleased to report that the Company has acquired by staking 63 new claims (‚ÄúFLV 3 Claims‚Äù) encompassing approximately 1295 acres contiguous to the south and east of the Company‚Äôs FLV Project located in Fish Lake Valley, Esmeralda County Nevada.  With the additional ground, ACME‚Äôs total number of claims in the area have increased to 207 totaling approximately 4002 acres.  These claims are pending final approval from the Bureau of Land Management (‚ÄúBLM‚Äù).

The FLV claim group is directly west and contiguous to Ioneer Ltd.‚Äôs world class Rhyolite Ridge Lithium-Boron project area.  
  
ACME recently received results of a Phase 2 geological field review and sampling program, announced March 13, 2023, showing numerous new occurrences of lithium values exceeding 1200 ppm and the highest surface value to date at 1418 ppm lithium. Boron anomalies up to 1964 ppm occur with and adjacent to surface lithium anomalies.  
  
A geophysical survey completed in the fall of 2022 indicates the presence of a down-dropped fault block with interpreted target clay sediments potentially similar to illite units identified in the nearby Rhyolite Ridge lithium deposit.  
  
Shallow drill holes to test the areas of strong lithium anomalies are warranted as are the lithium anomalies associated with the geophysical anomaly to the northwest.

29,DD," Honestly this seems like one of the more legitimate companies posted on here and I took a look at it two years ago and decided not to invest. I did a little research before posting this comment (not full DD) and I have two questions. With increasing revenues how can you explain the somewhat stagnant share price? Other than some volatility the price is almost exactly the same as it was two years ago when I first looked at it. 

Question two what do you think the end game is here and how long until that materializes? There are only so many options for OTC companies buyout, up-listing, being taken private, or bankruptcy and not all of those can end up great for shareholders. 

Thanks for the DD I‚Äôll take a look. Not a lot of great companies to invest in right now.",SmellView42069,3,/r/pennystocks/comments/11x9hkd/the_paradigm_shift_is_here_we_cant_lose_anymore/jd3c0v2/,0.0,0.872,0.128,0.9577

31,DD," Numbers taken from yesterdays PR /8K filing. 
We can't lose as we do have a Blockbuster product POOPH - that is a bestseller on Amazon, Walmart and Chewy - brought in almost $4million revenue this Q and the growth trajectory is going to continue as a nationwide Walmart launch was announced and 25k retail locations by summer targeted. 

Numbers become relevant and the market cap is only $60 Million. 

I did a long DD post last week and today's PR just confirmed the great numbers.

If you are interested in OTC investing and you also like Derisked Opportunities I highly recommend to take a look at BioLargo - Their Odor elimination Tech is used in POOPH - that alone will carry the entire compoany next Q.
