Well not so cheap now but we're cheap when I was entering long positions. Another good angle is to invest in US defense contractors.

12,PLTR," Ya, the whole tech industry got THUMPED TODAY!  For a big company with around a 50b market cap and 1b a year in revs PLTR bounced back quickly in after hours!  Pretty good! They have some good tech going for them if you are looking for more of a larger company investment with that link to NASA and Cathie Woods investment link.  Very good stuff and if I invested in larger companies I would consider them for sure.  Have had multiple people discuss it with me on boards.  One gal has been an engineering tech for decades and said based on what she knows that one will be a good addition to the portfolio.  However, it will never have the explosiveness of some of the smaller drone stocks if some things fall into place this year for the industry.  But it is definitely less risk and a good company from what I have seen.

13,UAVS," Totally agree!  And hope for this country you are right! From a standard portfolio wise and looking at trends IMHO you are right on the money.  Funny thing with Drones though is there is currently no US based major player COMMERCIALLY that is dominant in any way.  Mainly because DJI had so much of the market. Because of everything you said above I am betting on RCAT to become one of the leaders if not the leader through M & A since it is a pure play.  And one of their subsidiaries currently has 85% of he drone goggle market which is a good start!  I suppose also you could see some of the defense contractors and maybe auto manufacturers as well potentially branch out into large commercial delivery drones as well for shipping like Boeing and others.  But, they will still need tech and there would still be huge opportunities for sub contracts.  Kinda like the situation of Blockchain experts back in 2018.  IMHO there will soon not be enough talent to meet the demand in drones.  Could even see another large company like Verizon did with Skyway come and buy RCAT down the road for big money or UAVS since they are both pure plays.  Guess we will see.

22,ID," Thanks for that input!  There are other drone products that could fit into even stuff with DJI in the commercial sector as well.  Like RCAT has DroneBox that will be compatible with any drone for insurance purposes and remote ID will soon be required on all drones above micros.  Many investors do not know also, since it happened quite awhile ago, but RCAT has a partnership agreement through their Rotor Riot subsidiary with them.  They(RCAT and RR CEOs) actually went to China and met with the execs for the company to finalize it!  So, might end up being able to provide tracking and monitoring tech to DJI that is US made retrofitting old drones or new stuff?  Who knows.  But they are one that could benefit regardless because of that partnership and being involved with selling(currently they do on the Rotor Riot site) DJI stuff.  And wouldnt it be great if they announced some sort of contract to provide that chip on DJIs drones.

Just posted this above also.  Another redditor actually started a subreddit for RCAT.  Trying to build it since it looks like it may be a real sleeper to keeps on what is going on with it.

RCAT is still early IMHO and has very little volume and following mainly because they took four small drone companies and merged them into one in a shell that combined are around 12-15m in revenue.  So basically you had ZERO retail stock following even though many of the names of the subsidiaries are well known in the drone industry like Rotor Riot, FatShark, and Skypersonic which directly ties into infrastructure programs and PUDs and government contracts relevant to the article posted.  They also are literally days away from a NASDAQ uplist as well.  The game changer though that really made me go all in on RCAT is that they have a product called DroneBox they have been working on for 5 years that basically is like a black box for planes but it does other things as well like remote ID, and performance monitoring of the drone.  All that info is then stored on a blockchain format.  Imagining the massive growth we are just about to see in the commercial and government drone market, it makes sense that this unique product could be utilized on any drone doing any function there is.  They have actually stated this and said that once it launches sometime this year it will be compatible with ANY type of drone!  Anyway, check them out.  They are my favorite overall and structurally look amazing with a float of 3m and less then 30m shares out.

Other companies I did DD on as well and may be an option are UAVS(2m in revenues and already seemed over valued MC wise considering they only do agricultural drones), ALPP(which has great revenues in the 30-40m range but only a small piece is drones so not a pure play like UAVS or RCAT.  They also are right at their max authorized shares out which scares the crap out of me they will force a reverse split-got screwed that way before), TAKOF(Is a Canadian company focused on drones but has a burn rate of 12m a year and has had no revenues for years...looked like a stinky pinky OTC scam to me being used as a piggy bank), and DFLYF(looks like it could be an early stage one but the risk is super high with little revenues and large burn rate.  Could have future potential though)

RCAT currently as of today has a MC of around 100m!  Very undervalued compared to UAVS and ALPP who are both in the 500m to 1b MC area and IMHO are not as good of investment opportunities.

So at this point they have no industry, product, revenues, etc. based on that profile just expenses.

35,UAVS," ALPP is definitely decent!  Just would not qualify them as a pure play drone company though.  They do lots of other things unlike RCAT and UAVS and DFLYF who are strictly drone related products.  But ya, ALPP should eventually benefit overall from this also!  Will say though, even after the vote to not reverse split, I am still worried they may do that.  Had that shoved down my throat on another stock over the years with super shares.

49,TSLA," TSLA is heading for another down day today. Over the last 6 weeks, Tesla has lost \~29% from the peak of $900. But it is still 9X above the low of $70.

Some of my friends are sitting on shares with average purchase price below $400, waiting for Long term capital gain. I sold way too early, don't plan I want to buy back. This is too volatile and risky for me.

What would you do? wait for LTCG or sell now?",AnapanaDaily,44,/r/investing/comments/lxkp12/jobless_claims_another_745000_americans_filed_new/gpnqf8b/,0.084,0.814,0.102,0.5629
50,ATH," I recently had the opportunity to work at an Unemployment department for the past year. With the FPUC payments, it's more convenient to stay home and collect rather than going back to work making $10-15/hour. The numbers just don't make sense to go back to work as long as we keep handing out the additional $300/week. 

In the beginning of Covid it was an additional $600. This lured people in and many people are still home not doing anything. I got family/friends who are happily abusing unemployment. Some got laid off in 2019, before Covid, and reapt all the benefits of the CARES Act too. People have traveled, paid off debt, and spent a lot of money off these benefits. Why do you think we were hitting ATH in retail sales while Unemployment Rates hit ATH too? 

It boils my blood when people complain about the US Government not giving enough stimulus. We have supported MILLIONS of people. In the state I work we have been giving away the PUA to everyone who applies. 

I'm not criticizing people who choose to collect instead of working... The issue is the government is creating a fake economy by incentivising people to stay home and also suppressing wages.",cgomez97,1,/r/investing/comments/lxkp12/jobless_claims_another_745000_americans_filed_new/gpp9voq/,0.104,0.8,0.096,-0.2333
51,AI," Tesla will never be worth that trillion dollar cap it had. At least in my opinion. That's not to say it won't be a major player in the automarket. People have a rough time differentiating between if a stock is well priced vs whether it will be successful. It can be overpriced and have a good future. And you shouldn't buy overpriced goods unless you have to.

Tesla is a car company. It would take a lot of things going right for Tesla to take the market share its price suggests it will from the likes of Ford, Toyota, Chevy, Mercedes, etc. 

Elon Musk also hasn't shown me he's really interested in creating mega conglomerates like Amazon or Microsoft. Each new endeavor he seems to create a new business. Maybe this will change and he will merge things, but as of now I find no reason to treat Tesla that much different from the other car companies. 

I could buy in to a 300-400 billion market cap only because of the potential for their AI software and ability to branch into energy storage. Both are real ifs though. Because other car companies are doing similar things with cars I can see the average consumer actually being able to afford.

Anyways, if you bought around $70-$400 I'd sell now and I would have definitely sold it all at $900 because I just don't see it ever being worth that again.

This wasn't a *financial collapse* in which credit is going to be difficult for companies to get for years to come (2008) or deflationary effects spiral out of control crippling consumer spending (1929).",WeenisWrinkle,1,/r/investing/comments/lxkp12/jobless_claims_another_745000_americans_filed_new/gppa7sx/,0.054,0.843,0.103,0.6858

80,ICE," Many manufacturers have made similar promises about models offered by 2020 and haven’t stuck to them. I’m asking for specific production numbers that we can use as a reference over time of how well they are keeping their promise.

For example, Hyundai annually produces somewhere in the range of 4-5M cars today. From a Google search, they hope to produce 1 million EVs by 2025 (other articles cite they target 500k by 2025). So from their own higher estimates, they would be losing overall vehicle market share if they were going full EV unless they sustain or grow the production of their existing 4-5M ICE capacity. 

To hit those targets, they would need to grow production by 50% YoY to get from 1 million in 2025 to 5 million by 2029, still  flat with their overall market share. This is something people said it was impossible for Tesla to do. 

Meanwhile, Tesla already is producing 500k vehicles and has advancements such as the single piece rear casting and structural battery pack which will dramatically increase their own production rates, on top of the two new factories coming online by the end of this year. I’m not saying Tesla’s valuation is appropriately priced based off their car production rates alone but I think there is a lot of assumption in how easily people think OEMs can overcome their own momentum.",Capital_Ad7289,1,/r/investing/comments/lxkp12/jobless_claims_another_745000_americans_filed_new/gpokpi5/,0.021,0.909,0.071,0.8176

90,IMO," I believe Square acquired Caviar for $90-100m and sold it for $410m. Square acquired Caviar in 2014 so while a 4x ROI seems great, that $90-100m invested in 2014 Square stock would have had WAY better returns based on how the stock was moving without Caviar.

IMO the biggest factors to Square growth:

1. Square Capital/Banking Services
2. Square Cash
3. Square POS

The last two items here are what drive exponential growth in its banking services since they provide machine learning signals for their underwriting. IMO traditional underwriting is honestly going to be a way of the past (checking your credit score, debt-to-income etc.). These things will probably still be required by regulators but in Square's case not the key determining factors when it comes to extended credit and choosing interest rates. THAT is going to be the future, and for that, I'm still all in on the Square train.

But Tidal is just not a wise investment IMO. I bet Dorsey sees potential with cyrpto currency and NFT's for artists. Dorsey is really obsessed with crypto so he probably has some vision there but I just don't see it being super successful. Maybe they can get some more Square Cash customers out of this, some interesting crypto collaborations but that's it. Luckily this isn't a huge acquisition for Square ($250m in stock is nothing for Square right now) but that investment would have paid more dividends in other areas.

113,GCP," I have experience in setting up Snowflake in a Fortune 100 company. And I have also worked on Google Bigquery, AWS Redshift, and Azure DWH in the past. Here are my thoughts on its potentials.

1. Snowflake is a way better product than Bigquery, Redshift, or Azure DWH. It automatically handles all legal database SQL syntax(Oracle, SQL Server, etc.). So data migration from the legacy database is less complex with a minimum learning curve. This is true not just for developers but for all the end-users like Analysts.   

2. Multi-Cloud: It can be hosted in AWS, GCP, or  Azure. This might sound irrelevant. Here is why it's important. Let's say a company started using Bigquery because Google is the preferred partner. After a couple of years, things have changed, and the company decided to make Azure the company's preferred Cloud vendor. Now it's not that easy to migrate your Data warehouse from Bigquery to Azure DHW. With Snowflake, you are not tied up to a particular vendor. The point here is Snowflake gives flexibility, and enterprise companies love this flexibility. 

3. Snowflake integration is pretty neat. It integrates with GCS, AWS S3, etc., and with other APIs natively.  Sample use case. Running an ML model(API) on top of Snowflake data using SQL. You don't need to be an ML expert to run a model. Anyone with basic SQL can do this.  This is one example, Applications are endless.

4. Data sharing and Data marketplace. They are building a data catalog complemented by the data sharing feature—essentially data as a service. More data demand -> More data listed in catalog ->  Network effect growth through sharing-> Customer exponential growth->More money. I believe this will be huge, which is the main reason I'm bullish on Snowflake. Because snowflake supports multi-cloud,  it's not easy for other companies like Google/AWS to replicate this.

5. Snowflake Customer retention is really high, and I strongly believe this will continue to remain so. Most of Snowflake's customers are Enterprises.  In my experience, companies switch or change databases for 3 main reasons. 1. Scaling or maintenance issue 2. License or hardware end of life or no longer supports 3—cost savings. Snowflake is highly scalable and utilizes cloud infrastructure with zero maintenance. So issues 1 and 2 do not exist. For the cost, it is charged per usage. It's way cheaper than any other legacy database like Oracle, HANA, etc. Basically, once an enterprise adopts Snowflake as their data warehouse, I don't see any reason for switching unless something terrible goes wrong.  Many companies still bear Oracle because of the complexity and cost of migration even though they really want to.

6. They have some unique features. One that stands out for me is the feature called Time travel. ( Read about it https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-time-travel.html. This is mind-blowing. They also have the ability to create, schedule, run data pipelines without the need for any ELT/ETL tools. ( Including setting up dependencies).

118,SRE," So I work as an SRE for an ecommerce platform.  

Snowflake is a cloud data warehouse. If you use their solution, you are vendor locked to them. Their monitoring, they opinions on workflow, their service response time, their performance levels, their avaliablity.  

You cant tune it. But you still need a team inhouse to convert this DATA to INFORMATION. This team will also have the skillset to build a database with free offerings (think redis,memcached,mysql) anyway with a unified protocol if needed (graphql comes to mind).  

Why would you trust your business lifeblood to another company?  

So then maybe we are not the target audience. Then who is? healthcare? banks?  
Theres a reason fintech is huge now (ant,wepay). They dont take forever for anything to happen with shitty service.  
Banks are all relying on their reputation and money which is slowly being chipped away (robinhood,lmnd,e-wallets) if they dont adapt.  

So yes, overall there is a market for it for now.

123,IMO," I agree that both are meme stocks. Two crucial differences though. First, is simply scale. Gamestop has financially benefitted unfathomably more than $29m from the trading frenzy. It's been relatively limited in its ability to immediately offload shares due to SEC limitations, but it's been able to leverage the attention to bring in some top talent, potentially acquire some extremely legitimate smaller gaming companies. Second is that IMO even before the frenzy Gamestop was still a much more solid company than Hertz, insofar as it wasn't exactly on the brink of bankruptcy, and was closer to being in the early stages of a slow death ala Sears.

144,BHE," That's funny you mentioned energy infrastructure investments:

>BHE, unlike BNSF, pays no dividends on its common stock, a highly-unusual practice in the electric-utility
industry. That Spartan policy has been the case throughout our 21 years of ownership. Unlike railroads, our country’s
electric utilities need a massive makeover in which the ultimate costs will be staggering. The effort will absorb all of
BHE’s earnings for decades to come. We welcome the challenge and believe the added investment will be
appropriately rewarded.
Let me tell you about one of BHE’s endeavors – its $18 billion commitment to rework and expand a
substantial portion of the outdated grid that now transmits electricity throughout the West. BHE began this project in
2006 and expects it to be completed by 2030 – yes, 2030.
The advent of renewable energy made our project a societal necessity. Historically, the coal-based generation
of electricity that long prevailed was located close to huge centers of population. The best sites for the new world of
wind and solar generation, however, are often in remote areas. When BHE assessed the situation in 2006, it was no
secret that a huge investment in western transmission lines had to be made. Very few companies or governmental
entities, however, were in a financial position to raise their hand after they tallied the project’s cost.
BHE’s decision to proceed, it should be noted, was based upon its trust in America’s political, economic and
judicial systems. Billions of dollars needed to be invested before meaningful revenue would flow. Transmission lines
had to cross the borders of states and other jurisdictions, each with its own rules and constituencies. BHE would also
need to deal with hundreds of landowners and execute complicated contracts with both the suppliers that generated
renewable power and the far-away utilities that would distribute the electricity to their customers. Competing interests
and defenders of the old order, along with unrealistic visionaries desiring an instantly-new world, had to be brought on
board.
Both surprises and delays were certain. Equally certain, however, was the fact that BHE had the managerial
talent, the institutional commitment and the financial wherewithal to fulfill its promises. Though it will be many years
before our western transmission project is completed, we are today searching for other projects of similar size to take
on.
Whatever the obstacles, BHE will be a leader in delivering ever-cleaner energy.

Nominal GDP = Quantity of Money × Velocity of Money

Prices = Quantity of Money × Velocity of Money / Real GDP

152,CD," Here’s a very simplified explanation.  There’s a lot to unpack, but at a high level it should get you to a point where you can continue your research.  

So gold is literally a rock.   As an investment vehicle it’s a non yield generating asset.   It doesn’t give you dividends, doesn’t generate revenue, it just is a rock that has value.   That value is generally stable and usually doesn’t go to zero.   

It’s similar to cash.  Cash is paper.   It only has value because someone else thinks it (or the us Govt/military says it does).  The future value of cash fluctuates and in some extreme cases (Zimbabwe or Venezuela for instance) it can becomes extremely weak.  

The reason people go to gold is generally they feel their cash will be worth less tomorrow and they don’t have anywhere else to invest it (or they are over leveraged in riskier assets).   So they transfer their cash to gold, which generally has been an uncorrelated asset, meaning it doesn’t rise and fall with the stock market (that’s been proven wrong btw...like March 2020 when everything sold off due to liquidity issues). 

When yields are low, and real yields are negative (I.e. inflation is higher than the yield) people go gold.   Because if you’re cash, your cash is worth less tomorrow.   When yields go up, and inflation is low, then gold goes down, because you could put money in a bond or CD and make more money and it’s pretty safe.   When yields go up and inflation goes up, then again people go to gold, but only if inflation is higher than the yield (i.e real yields are lower than nominal yields).   

To;dr.   Gold is correlated to real yields, not necessarily inflation.  Inflation just happens to be a component of real yields.",SDboltzz,3,/r/investing/comments/lx98sc/a_little_insight_on_whats_going_on_with_the/gpo4w8a/,0.075,0.821,0.105,0.8343

I don’t find it useful to argue with those who can’t be bothered to examine data over their intuition, however I will point out one interesting bit: there’s really three mainstream measures of inflation, the CPI, the PCE, and the GDP deflator - unsurprisingly to me they all tend to support the accuracy of the others.  Those are of course calculated by the BLS, and the latter two being calculated by the BEA.  This may be a surprise to you but the Fed isn’t listed here at all.

167,CPA," I’m not super familiar with Ben Felix but he’s another guy that doesn’t really have any credentials in the subject, and he is often wrong to get to the right answer. 

Like you should invest in index funds, but I know Felix in particular has made arguments that they have no market impact and there’s dozens of studies to the opposite. 

I don’t listen to podcasters unless they’re economists - I mostly just read central bank publications, financial industry commentary from economists, and peer reviewed studies.  Almost everything else is noise.  Listening to guys like Roche will just have you listening to someone who might get 70% right but will bullshit through the rest to sound smart.  I know this because I’ve personally interacted with Roche, and once challenged on his ideas he kinda fell apart.

Back when this sub had a higher percentage of people with deep understanding of Econ this thread happened, where 3-4 people all basically told Cullen he had no idea what he was talking about, and he just went with “agree to disagree”. 

https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/5p44yh/feed_my_confirmation_bias_bond_guru_who_called/

There’s also his dumbass takes on indexing:

https://reddit.com/r/investing/comments/49yl62/new_yorker_is_passive_investment_actively_hurting/

Let me put it this way, to add some perspective, Cullen’s education is basically just an undergraduate degree in finance and some basic licenses, that’s it.  He runs an RIA with less than 100MM in AUM and an average client size of like 600k.  Now I’m not the end all of authorities here but I’ve personally got 260MM of AUM, my team is at 5.3B.  And my average client size is just north of 7.5M.  I also have an MBA, CFP and CPA.  I don’t however have a personal blog.  But - I would never say “I’m an expert here, listen to me”.  I’d just go ahead and still cite the real experts in the field.  Cullen is basically a bottom tier RIA that presents himself as some sort of industry thought leader, and he ain’t.

This Felix guy seems to have slightly more going for him, but he’s still in a similar boat.  Basically people on Reddit love to treat these real average guys like they’re some sort of gurus, and to me they aren’t really that accomplished outside of managing to build a high profile for their blog/podcast.",MasterCookSwag,3,/r/investing/comments/lx8hwv/money_printing_and_inflation/gpn4tz0/,0.067,0.858,0.075,0.6242

I did write earlier this year about being increasingly concerned about the ""100% Ark!"" posts, but I don't think that there's a major chance that Ark will implode in the same manner as Woodford - if I remember correctly, the issue with Woodford's holdings was the illiquid private holdings (a bunch of which were sold to Acacia Research (ACTG), which flipped a lot of them for a quick profit and now is going to be working with Woodford on his new fund); while Ark's increasingly large % stakes in a number of names are concerning, they don't hold any private companies (given Ark's yolo nature, it's always surprised me that they don't.) I also agree that ""selling larger names to focus on smaller ones"" is not an appealing idea - especially if it's taking place so soon into a correction. 

Ark had seemingly started to buy larger names recently (a few big pharma names in ARKG for example) and that feels like it should be a longer-term thing rather than I guess being viewed as something large and liquid to flip the first sign of a correction. Ark had a rare kind of year last year and I really do think that setting up for the inevitability that this year wasn't going to be a repeat wouldn't have been a bad idea rather than just keeping the growth YOLOs turned up to 11.

So I don't know that Ark is going to have a Woodford problem, but I think people have to realize that uber-aggressive growth YOLOs go up until they don't and when that stops, it looks like recent weeks. Cathie has said that there will be major corrections but it does feel like ""major correction"" yet she also says she ""We Still Expect North Of 20% Compounded Annual Returns To Our [ARK] Portfolios Over Next 5 Years"" (https://www.benzinga.com/exclusives/21/03/19991356/ark-invests-cathie-wood-says-we-still-expect-north-of-20-compounded-annual-returns-to-our-ark-portfo), which I do find a little concerning - I don't recall a retail fund manager stating expected returns in that manner. Between the unusual returns last year and statements like that, I do think Ark could have done a better job dialing down the hype and offering more realistic expectations in an attempt to set people up for the long-term. For all the people ""long-term"" in their view of Ark, expect a few more of these in the next 5 years.

There's going to be significant corrections in highly aggressive growth investing and this isn't going to be the last one by any means. I don't a big chance of Ark imploding but if it did I'd think things would have to get substantially bad enough that I'd be concerned what the broader market also looked like in that scenario.

Edit: This sort of stuff mentioned in the blog ""ARK Invest has no chief risk officer on its website. ARK’s chief operating officer is Tom Staudt. According to Mr. Staudt’s LinkedIn, prior to joining ARK, he was the account executive at WILX-TV, a local station for Lansing, Michigan."" is concerning and is something Ark should discuss (""non traditional"" is okay...to a point.)",dvdmovie1,6,/r/investing/comments/lxh7am/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/gpnbfse/,0.03,0.864,0.106,0.9915

I read all of his DDs and a bunch more and then I bought (a measly 33 shares bc I didn't have any free funds).  Even though I'm in rkt for the long haul, if i see the opportunity to make a bunch of money, I absolutely will.  It means I'm betting on a dip so i can buy back even more shares.  Those are all risks I'm willing to take.

I follow people like u/The_Big_Short_2020, u/SIR_JACK_A_LOT and u/jn_ku.  If they post something, I read it and pay attention.  People like that do great deep dive analysis.  They make a lot more money than they lose.  I figure I can learn something from their opinions and I have.  My own analysis is getting better b/c I finally had a chance to read some really good ones.",earthrogue,1,/r/investing/comments/lxh7am/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/gpnm6qj/,0.054,0.794,0.152,0.9607

I remember last year I just closed my investment accounts and then one day everything was fine again, but right now feels different.

265,BG," > Cathie Wood never had an amazing track record before ARK. She seems more of a marketer to me than a real PM.

Fantastic marketer and plays to her audience too much sometimes with statements like ""bitcoin may replace bonds"" from the other day.

I don't think Ark/Cathie are bad, but I think the sort of ""we're a speculative growth fund and therefore have to keep the growth YOLOs continually dialed to 11"" is unnecessarily risky. Perhaps the marketing and fund focus paints the funds into a corner - if there's something even slightly boring that winds up in the portfolio it may risk being labeled as not ""on brand."" 

""And now we see all of the copycat funds emerging""

There were a number of other funds that did similarly to Ark last year (Zevenbergen Growth/Genea, the Morgan Stanley funds subadvised by Counterpoint, Baron Partners, Scottish Mortgage and probably some of the other BG funds, a couple of others) but did you hear about any of those? Not much. 

""the sign of a top""

IMO, the top (at least for the near term) was when people started calling Cathie ""Money Tree"" (https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-05/cathie-wood-amasses-50-billion-and-a-new-nickname-money-tree)  Nothing against her, but investing is not easy and if people start thinking ""this is easy"" it shouldn't be encouraging it should be concerning. Her being called ""Money Tree"" was a sign that things had gotten overdone.

I think that the hype became very excessive and they didn't do enough to dial down expectations. Yes, there were discussions that corrections will happen but it felt like in the same presentation it was also ""but we expect 20%+ a year for the next half a decade.""  You also saw ridiculous inflows into Ark in the last quarter of last year after the funds had already gone up something like 100% last year.

Some have compared it to Janus in the dot com era. A morningstar researcher on Ark's inflows: ""What we've seen over the past year plus is equivalent to like 16 Januses during that firm's heyday."" (https://twitter.com/syouth1/status/1360958603746811907)

So do I think Ark is going to implode? Probably not. Did the hype become overly excessive and need a period of shaking out people who came in late? Yeah. I said earlier this year that Ark had the tremendous flywheel of performance and then inflows and then posting their trades (and people buying what Ark is buying, which pushes up fund performance, which attracts more inflows, etc.) But that flywheel can reverse and the sort of sudden ""everyone to the other side of the boat"" rotation that has been seen lately is what that often looks like.",dvdmovie1,1,/r/investing/comments/lxh7am/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/gpnh43y/,0.058,0.849,0.093,0.9322

299,CRSR," there are a few posts around in various subs. I'm trying to sum up:

the secondary offering in january wasn't dillutive. it just allowed the lockeded up investors to sell shares for 35$. most of them didnt even think about selling at 35 $. So at the current prices even after lockup it's unlikely.

Majority of shares are institutions. Biggest one is Eagletree Capital, which is a major Investor in CRSR since 2017. Below OP maybe very right about his assumption, that neither Management nor Eaglytree Capital will hurt themselfs by selling a big amount of shares.

309,CDNA," I interviewed there a few years ago when they were just $40/share. Not a bad company and a lot to look forward too. I wouldn’t compare it to illumina though as that is a whole other animal. (Illumina basically created the liquid biopsy space with their sequencers, running PCR out the door.)  But the two founders are ex-Illumina through another buyout so I was hopeful for one here. 

It’s a good steady company, but at 15b for diagnostic products, I don’t know how far it can go without some serious pharma partnership or CDx indications.  I do prefer CDNA at their price and growth prospects. A buyout at 2-3x current market cap is possible.",herpderpgood,6,/r/investing/comments/lxafnt/with_guardant_health_gh_leading_the_way_the/gpm96fo/,0.0,0.863,0.137,0.9042
310,DHR," I started buying at the IPO, was a very large holding for a while and sold out remainder of it entirely recently at $162. It's still a very good company (and I do like how every earnings call starts with a patient story), but it's going to be a competitive field and everything ""disruptive"" felt (and still feels a bit) crowded. 

When GH IPO'd in 2018, it priced at $19 and opened at around $25 I think? Reasonable. Back then the GH IPO (as well as the TXG IPO in 2019) were associated with Softbank, which was - if anything - kind of a negative at the time given the WeWork debacle.  If it IPO'd today it would probably be like ""OMG CATHIES GONNA BUY THAT"" and if it priced at $19 would probably open at $38. What used to be an area that not everyone looked at is now overcrowded with everybody looking for the next ""disruptive growth"" thing. I've owned EXAS at times too and no longer that either.

322,TA," New to options trading here and my head is going to explode from all the information (or misinformation) that can be found on the interwebs. Hopefully some of you can help clear a couple things up...  


Selling options contracts seems  fairly safe. A bit of TA to find support/resistance and read up on news  regarding a particular company and you can sell some short term  contracts and make a few bucks. What is the biggest factor that affects  the value of a contract? Is it the Implied Volatility? (excluding the  expiry, as i know the closer to expiry the less valuable the contract  is, the Theta i believe?)

When  selling a contract, you want the strike price to be somewhere that is  realistic, but probably outside of a resistance/support line, so in  turn.... Unrealistic. This way your contract is not exercised and  expires worthless, but some poor fella believes it may actually get to  that target...?

When buying  calls/puts, i understand you do not HAVE to exercise the contract.  Obviously it would be in the best interest of the purchaser for the  price to at least hit break even, but can you buy a contract and turn  around and sell that same contract for profit before expiry?

Is the VIX something that should be as heavily considered as some articles claim it to be when selling options contracts?",RhoidRaging,3,/r/investing/comments/lxh6sl/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gpo2hdt/,0.039,0.85,0.112,0.9389

I do plan to hold a majority of my portfolio for a while, but I have a few short term plays that look so painful right now, those being PFE, RKT, GME, AMC and TRX (to be clear, Tron and Tanzanian Gold have the same abbreviation, I own Tanzanian Gold stocks).

336,LI," So let's say, hypothetically, my entire portfolio is down about 40% and I am in the red across every position. My portfolio is approx 50% marijuana, 30% tech across 5g and EV, and vegan/plant based for the rest. Everything is down almost exactly the same. 

(Apparently my trading strategy is to buy at the peaks when I think they are dips, and then panic sell at the real dips right before rebound. But that's a different post)

Feeling that the market will likely continue on this downward trend for a while, what are some of the options someone would have to mitigate that risk?

Pull out of everything and use what's left of the investment account to buy back in to different trades when things are going to be looking up? 

Just hold until things eventually bounce back and consider myself out of the game for a while? 

Hedge these positions with different calls and puts to maximize my leverage? 

Not looking for financial advice obviously, just some ideas from people with more experience and wondering what anyone else might do.

Info about me and my position: 

I'm 35yo.

I earn ~130k/yr.

I'm Investing for fun, to learn,  and increase income... hopefully... eventually.

I have Approx 10k invested down to 6k. 16k in cash in investment acct. 7k of that are realized gains since Jan 10, 2021. Losses are eating away my realized gains right now. I do not need this money to live. 

Biggest losers:

344,ANY," # Question: How do I find the Early Redemption Fee for Mutual Funds?

Early Redemption Fee is an additional fee that some Mutual Funds may charge people who buy the fund and then sell it before 60 or 90 days. To discourage short-term trading.

I have a bunch of Mutual Funds I want to sell, and it was pretty short-term.

I don't know how to check which funds have this Fee and how much it actually is... I tried to find the information but I can't seem to be able to.

If you want an example Mutual Fund, you can use ARTMX.

I tried using Schwab and Fidelity to search and go over the data for the Mutaul Funds, and the CLOSEST thing I found was ""Short-term Redemption Fee (on shares sold 90 days or less from settlement)""

But I could not find the actual AMOUNT of the Redemption Fee :|

They also have ""Fund's Contingent Redemption Fee"" and its listed as 0.00% BUT I think that would be something different entirely, I am not 100% sure in that case....

Just can't find the data! Maybe its 2% or 4% or straight up $50.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Also, do you know if its a Fee for selling ANY amount of the Mutual Fund within a short amount of time, or if you have to close your entire position for the Fee to count.... I think its the first one but I'm not sure.",NorthEfficient7473,1,/r/investing/comments/lxh6sl/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gpoxwl3/,0.036,0.921,0.043,0.1916

Hi there!

&#x200B;

This should the first of many posts I will publish in order to gather tips, information, advice and, being Reddit, insults, harassment, judgment and admonishment. I´m all in for the whole shebang. I will post this post in /stocks, /investing, /pennystock and /wallstreetbets and when and if, will I be allowed to post with my 2nd acc, I will delete those posts here on main, because of some personal info. I wanna ask all of you guys, because there is so much variation of information for me, at this stage, in order to obscure one kind of knowledge from the other. Even if some dislike the other subs, the end game is the same, make [money](https://youtu.be/PBwAxmrE194?t=16).

&#x200B;

Who am I:

I´m a 36 yo male studying behavioral science in Sweden. I live with my SO and my dog in my own apartment, own a 4.5L\\100km Diesel Hyundai and plan to have a comfortable life, working in the state department for social service, in one form or another, with some extra income from the stock market. If I´ll ever hit a couple of those tenbagger, I will retire and never look back. I am very new to the investing game, starting in November 2020 and managed to make 500$ out of 2$k investment, believing that I cracked the code and discovered WSB in January 22nd. [Cause = effects](https://youtu.be/6rtYfx1-FS4?t=61).

&#x200B;

My interests (area of confidence): Videogames on PC and console, my dog, books, movies, Warhammer, light outdoor experience. Travelling was number one on the list pre Covid. This translate in me taking interest in stocks in that area, possibly (shall we invest now in airlines, before the summer?).

&#x200B;

My goals for next month:

1. Read, watch Youtube 30-60 mins a day about investing and the stock market.

2. Invest in a long hold stock of which I have done my own DD (SNE$ probably).

3. Learn about MA + candlestick + basic statistics.

&#x200B;

My economics: 

\- I take about 950$ of students loan at 0,05% interest rate and I should have around 16$k of debt by the end of this academical year. If I will keep on to take the loan, I should arrive to around 25$k debt, when I´ll be done with my studies in a couple of years. Every month I get about 350$ of extra cash from the government for studying. Yep.

\- I also work part-time in a rehab and I can count on about 850$ extra cash after taxes. 

\- I own an apartment for the market value of 220$k of which I have 65$k left to pay.

\- The car is paid for and I have a very frugal lifestyle. Extra frugal under Covid, since my main expense were travels.

&#x200B;

My position in the market:

[Not good in retrospective](https://imgur.com/gallery/31nJG4d), but I learned more about stocks in the last 45 days than I did in 36 years, so I consider it an investment in knowledge. I learned for example that I can FOMO and can fall into an herd mentality, I´m good at holding, bad at exiting in a win smaller than expected, worst at exercising losing calls. I am ignorant, hopefully not stupid. We´ll see I guess. Most of them are honestly gambling with low effort DD and FOMO impulsive buy, especially the pennystocks. The ""meme"" stock it is it´s own thing. CTXR$ I believe has actually potential, TBLT$ aswell, even if the fundamentals are not there. NOK is meh, and Nordnet is change money. However all in all, is 5k I could afford to lose and it is not a loss until you sell right? I also own 300$ of a high risk/high reward Swedish index fund and about 2$k of a low risk/low reward bank fund from ICA bank (also Swedish). Somewhere I have 1k saved for emergencies. I use Avanza and I applied to trade 212 and Nordnet in order to diversify investing, trading and OTC.

348,SO," Since my post got banned 4 times for 4 different reasons, I think I will post here for the next month, if that makes sense to the mods.  


Hi there!

&#x200B;

This should the first of many posts I will publish in order to gather tips, information, advice and, being Reddit, insults, harassment, judgment and admonishment. I´m all in for the whole shebang. I will post this post in /stocks, /investing, /pennystock and /wallstreetbets and when and if, will I be allowed to post with my 2nd acc, I will delete those posts here on main, because of some personal info. I wanna ask all of you guys, because there is so much variation of information for me, at this stage, in order to obscure one kind of knowledge from the other. Even if some dislike the other subs, the end game is the same, make [money](https://youtu.be/PBwAxmrE194?t=16).

&#x200B;

Who am I:

I´m a 36 yo male studying behavioral science in Sweden. I live with my SO and my dog in my own apartment, own a 4.5L\\100km Diesel Hyundai and plan to have a comfortable life, working in the state department for social service, in one form or another, with some extra income from the stock market. If I´ll ever hit a couple of those tenbagger, I will retire and never look back. I am very new to the investing game, starting in November 2020 and managed to make 500$ out of 2$k investment, believing that I cracked the code and discovered WSB in January 22nd. [Cause = effects](https://youtu.be/6rtYfx1-FS4?t=61).

&#x200B;

My interests (area of confidence): Videogames on PC and console, my dog, books, movies, Warhammer, light outdoor experience. Travelling was number one on the list pre Covid. This translate in me taking interest in stocks in that area, possibly (shall we invest now in airlines, before the summer?).

&#x200B;

My goals for next month:

1. Read, watch Youtube 30-60 mins a day about investing and the stock market.

2. Invest in a long hold stock of which I have done my own DD (SNE$ probably).

3. Learn about MA + candlestick + basic statistics.

&#x200B;

My economics: 

\- I take about 950$ of students loan at 0,05% interest rate and I should have around 16$k of debt by the end of this academical year. If I will keep on to take the loan, I should arrive to around 25$k debt, when I´ll be done with my studies in a couple of years. Every month I get about 350$ of extra cash from the government for studying. Yep.

\- I also work part-time in a rehab and I can count on about 850$ extra cash after taxes. 

\- I own an apartment for the market value of 220$k of which I have 65$k left to pay.

\- The car is paid for and I have a very frugal lifestyle. Extra frugal under Covid, since my main expense were travels.

&#x200B;

My position in the market:

[Not good in retrospective](https://imgur.com/gallery/31nJG4d), but I learned more about stocks in the last 45 days than I did in 36 years, so I consider it an investment in knowledge. I learned for example that I can FOMO and can fall into an herd mentality, I´m good at holding, bad at exiting in a win smaller than expected, worst at exercising losing calls. I am ignorant, hopefully not stupid. We´ll see I guess. Most of them are honestly gambling with low effort DD and FOMO impulsive buy, especially the pennystocks. The ""meme"" stock it is it´s own thing. CTXR$ I believe has actually potential, TBLT$ aswell, even if the fundamentals are not there. NOK is meh, and Nordnet is change money. However all in all, is 5k I could afford to lose and it is not a loss until you sell right? I also own 300$ of a high risk/high reward Swedish index fund and about 2$k of a low risk/low reward bank fund from ICA bank (also Swedish). Somewhere I have 1k saved for emergencies. I use Avanza and I applied to trade 212 and Nordnet in order to diversify investing, trading and OTC.

349,UI," Is there a paper trading website like Investopedia that allows group rankings AND is real time?

Investopedia has like a 20 min delay and is incredibly difficult to use (especially when I've gotten so used to the UI of much better platforms). I also want the ability to compete with friends like Investopedia has which has been really cool. It worked for our 3 month long game we had, but it wont do for options. We're trying to be monkeys and we need real time prices. I've seen a couple of apps and website mentioned but I dont know anything about if they offer the ability to make groups and have a ranking systems. This is probably a very niche request but I figured it was worth to ask about anyway.

358,DD," Not a stock but I'd recommend looking at Nigeria, or similar countries, as currently they have a high baby population and a low senior population, and in a decade or two we will see a high amount of ""producer's"" (high income high spenders, people at the peak of their career) and low ""dependents"" (low spenders, who may need assistance from the government) . Since there are low dependents, if the government plays there cards right and are competent and such, we could see growth in Nigeria similar to what China saw in the past 20 years. To invest in Nigeria there is the NGE ETF. But Nigeria is a risky play, as Nigeria is currently in a economic recession, due to covid and prior, and with oil, a major Nigerian industry, going out of fashion, it could see some problems. Another recommendation would be Sony.

359,RH," The issue is robinhood does not have IRAs or any tax advantaged accounts. Good financial planning says you should be investing in retirement accounts before investing in taxable accounts like RH offers

Most common advice is to invest in the following order

So I would probably look to setup a IRA if you do not have one and fund that before investing in a taxable account

I don't pick individual stocks, just hold low fee passive index funds, focus on minimizing taxes, portfolio theory, and then just let it sit and don't touch it. Bogleheads is closely associated with Vanguard, and there is good reason this sub's FAQ recommends Vanguard.

I suck at giving advice on individual stocks and performing DD. Did it for a time, made a little money, but I underperformed the market. So take that for what you will lol. I'm of the opinion tho that most people also suck at picking stocks (including 95% of people on this and other subs).

392,JNJ," If your intention is using dividends as a hedge, then you’re acknowledging what I’ve been saying. Hedges are to prevent loss not make profit, which once again dividend stocks have a history of lesser gains.

You’re saying a 90 year old investor uses dividend stocks, so it must be the best investment. Are bonds strong long-term investments too? Or gold? Of course not. He’s been an amazing investor over the years. I’m not taking away an his achievements or saying his age makes him a bad investor. However, one of the first things any investor should learn is the older the get the safer you should play your investments. This means smaller long-term gains with the benefit of a stable short-term portfolio. 

If you wish to look at his company’s fund, which isn’t meant for just retirees or older investors, you’ll see the returns have underperformed the S&P for a long time. By either logic, it’s an insincere comparison or contrary evidence.

Why would you invest in anything else if there was a magic stock that could hedge inflation *and* produce statistically similar ROI annually. Buffet made his money. Now he wants to keep it much more then he wants to grow it.

Examples like Apple at .6% yield isn’t going to hedge inflation or provide long-term value. True dividend stocks are going to be JPM, JNJ, PH, T, etc. Apple is technically a dividend stock, but it’s dividends are negligible and very young compared to the rest of the dividend market. Using it as your definition of a “dividend stock” is dangerous, as it doesn’t represent the total dividend market at all.

Thanks to funds like Vanguard’s, we can find that the ROI of a dividend portfolio such as VHDYX can may be half of the S&P or even a similar vanguard fund that follows the indices. If you’re looking for dividends, you’re doing so for the steady returns. Bot large value.

The IRS has a **serious** underfunding problem, because Congress doesn't want to get audited themselves.  Typically, when headcount goes down, the first department to get cut is Enforcement -- making it harder for the IRS to track down abusers (and there probably are some of those not only -in- Congress, but also among their good friends).

Converting a cryptocurrency into another cryptocurrency, is a taxable event because you are selling one and buying another in dollar equivalents.

We would need to know if Amazon intends to buy *and* hold.  If they intend to hold, it would be because they anticipate ATSG's price remaining stable or improving, which is only likely to happen if Amazon renews their courier/lease agreement with them.  Is that the game you guys are at here? 

If so, then I agree that Amazon buying and holding ATSG shares would suggest an appreciation in its market value as Amazon would be strengthening their corporate ties, but I wouldn't feel sure about that theory unless and until Amazon and ATSG renew their partnership.",HardlyEvenKnow,3,/r/investing/comments/lx4yht/atsg_and_amazon_warrants_expiring/gpl3qjd/,0.029,0.776,0.194,0.9187
