0,FSD," I'm sceptical. This is at odds with both company's positions for the last several years.

Toyota has loudly stated that their primary path is hybrid ICE/EV towards a final goal of Hydrogen fuel cells. There was a presentation came out about 18months/2 years ago on it, and there's been nothing released that I've seen contradicting that plan (until this rumour). Furthermore Mr Toyoda has been publicly dismissive of Tesla, it would be very culturally odd for a Japanese ~~CEO~~ President (Edit wrong title) to step away from those unusually strong words and back into partnership.

Similarly this isn't congruent with Tesla's stated plans (although they are far more likely to do an abrupt change than Toyota). They have stated they're happy to sell their skateboard when they have spare capacity (ie production capability exceeds demand), but they've also made it very clear that their primary focus in the car space is the ""machine that builds the machine"" (in Musk's words) - that is they're focussed on developing their ability to build their gigafactories and the optimisation of the build cycle (the single piece casting of entire subframes etc ""giga press"" as they call it) and FSD. Trying to get a partner up to speed on their software platforms is going to divert a lot of resources away from their core goals and isn't in line with the way Musk has behaved for the last 5 years across all his companies.

If Tesla were looking for a Japanese partner to crack into that space, wouldn't a smaller player like Honda or Subaru be a more logical choice than a company that has been very negative about their previous experience with them ?",abrasiveteapot,58,/r/stocks/comments/mg91ws/tesla_and_toyota_are_considering_jointly/gssc4ha/,0.053,0.896,0.051,0.1512

41,AI," As someone who used to be in the 100% passive investment camp, I'd like to present a potentially unpopular opinion - the energy sector is slow and a lot of investors enter energy from other sectors not realizing specifics at play - therefore, the energy sector is ripe for bullshit (cursory glance at amount of energy companies mentioning AI vs. what even just ML (which is just a smaller subset of AI) can actually be useful for and not just bullshitting tells the story).

Therefore ETFs such as ICLN and PBW (of which I owned both at some point in the recent past), just aggravate this situation by investing broadly according to market cap, not helping anyone really, let alone their investors, in weeding out garbage from potential winners. And we can also talk about what's a winner company vs. what's a winner stock/investment and how the two might be disconnected, but that's for another story.

We can zoom out of this and start talking about Vanguard and Blackrock who are forced to buy shit companies just because they are in an index but that's veering offtopic in this discussion - however it does apply to ICLN, PBW and others.

61,BHP," I like your argument and agree wholeheartedly with most sentiments although rather lacking in regards to factual information especially when using ""wonky"" as an argument against said companies. 

I've always wondered why folks haven't looked to mineral resources as a safe strategy for portfolio growth. We know 'Green' electrification is the way forward and we know we need an absolute shit ton of certain strategic minerals such as Copper, Nickel, Zinc, Lithium among other things. The only mineral I've really seen this exponential growth hit was Lithium. Even with Lithium I'm hesitant to say it's the way forward as we've come to find the impact of lithium mining is extremely detrimental to aquifers and the environment overall. 

Back Pedal a little bit to Strategic metals, Copper, Nickel, Zinc. These metals have a multitude of applications and will have many more come future breakthroughs. So I ask, why haven't we seen Mining players see similar growth albeit some have seen tremendous gains but overall it's not reflected as proportional to Lithium.

I've been fortunate enough to get myself a Mining Engineering degree so I know a thing or two about the industry and can pick out the nuggets of gold when I read through the right Technical report which to the untrained eye looks like utter nonsense. This has led me to making some pretty wise investments thus far.

What I'm getting at is, I'm with you on the safe bets but why haven't the masses realized that in order to further these technologies and initiatives we need to dig up some rock and we have well known miners digging up some good rock and others with huge potential.

My high flying mining players I've got in my portfolio at the moment are:
 Rio Tinto (Huge miner, equally huge dividend)
 Barrick (Gold Player who recently erased some big debt and are frothing at the mouth with future potential given the trajectory of inflation)
Talon Metals (High Grade Green Nickel project in the US)(Future Mine in the US and will come online as the only remaining US Nickel mine shuts down (~2023)
BHP (Huge Player even bigger Staying power also a solid dividend) 



TLDR: Why gamble exponential losses when you can have safe solid returns and still see solid growth. Tech needs minerals, Minerals need miners. Give the miners some love <3",ZiggWigg,8,/r/stocks/comments/mg5nij/strategy_im_out_of_anything_that_looks_wonky/gsrubwt/,0.041,0.802,0.157,0.9935

In recent news, Jack Ma is trying to rebuild ANT valutation by increasing its cut of profit respective to that of the banks it works with. This shows he still has bargaining power.

I’m no expert, but suspect the interests of Ma and the Chinese government are largely the same, that they need each other to prosper and both know it.
Ma obviously can’t go against the party, it would be business (and potentially personal) suicide. He has little reason to do so, aside maybe personal ideals. Still in the past he has shown willingness to bow if needed.

The party wants to control power and information, and a growing stable economy. They want China to be a leader of the world and its successful business is reason of proudness.
This is more easily accomplished ensuring the loyalty of business leaders, rather than dismantling what they have built.

75,TSLA," >Bitcoin? Out. Not a real currency and way too volatile and uncertain.

This is the one that completely stumps me on how the value is still ~10X up over the year.  

I keep hearing 'hedge against inflation'...'the future of currency'...

On any given day the rise/fall of BTCUSD value can be more 'inflation/deflation' than the USD has seen in a decade.  

And as far as replacing governmental currencies... that's a pipe-dream that would take years in the making.  Tighter regulations and  simple volatility precludes that happening anytime soon... people want to know that the $1 they spent on X on Tuesday can buy the same next Tuesday.  

... And as for the argument that TSLA, etc. is now taking BTCUSD as payments (solidifying it as a currency standard) I guarantee that the moment that transaction clears they're converting it to USD, Yen, etc.  This is probably the biggest red-herring of them all.  

I do think digital currency is the future... but no way in hell do I think BTCUSD is 'destined' to be the one and worth the current price.",Karnes,4,/r/stocks/comments/mg5nij/strategy_im_out_of_anything_that_looks_wonky/gsremjy/,0.069,0.879,0.052,-0.7906
76,USA," Tesla is overpriced right now, or at least priced in for future growth over the next decade. I’d buy around 300-400$/share in a heartbeat though.
GameStop I’m holding my 5 shares, I’m not in it for the money, I’m in it for the memes.

The rest I don’t really have an opinion on except one which I think you should reconsider.

Bitcoin. It’s being seen by many people and companies as a real asset/hedge against inflation. It has always been volatile and uncertain, but that hasn’t stopped it from going from a penny for multiple bitcoin to 60,000$ for a bitcoin. Most people don’t feel comfortable buying in because it’s too volatile, but the fact is it’s literally the best investment of the past decade, and so far even the best investment of this decade. The way I look at it is a hedge against basically everything. Everyone should put in 1–5% of their stock portfolio in bitcoin, not only would it increase its value if everyone did so, but it would lessen the volatility in the long run. Not only that, but what’s a few % of your portfolio? You should be making a decent return, probably a very minimum of 5%(just to beat inflation) in your portfolio, so if you put 5% of bitcoin in your portfolio you’re losing out on one year of gains by putting 5% into bitcoin, and that’s saying that it goes to 0$, which will never happen. 

I’m assuming you live in the USA, but it holds true no matter where you live, but if the USA has an collapse of its massive debt, things could get really bad here, our dollar could become worthless. For me, 5% of my money in bitcoin is a hedge against that securing my future, knowing I will be able to be independent from the government if it does happen. I’d put the probability at maybe 5% or more of a total/major collapse in my lifetime, and that’s just piece of mind. I’d put the probability that bitcoin becomes a stable/seen as a legitimate currency in the next 10-20 years at 90%. 5% that it completely fails. For me, those are good odds. I can’t see bitcoin just leaving completely. If anything, each continent gets its own form of blockchain and bitcoin becomes the middleman for exchanging currency.",RS_Germaphobic,2,/r/stocks/comments/mg5nij/strategy_im_out_of_anything_that_looks_wonky/gsrq2u2/,0.083,0.823,0.095,0.6213

138,GE," Im not the one you replied to but:

You probably only wanted to advise people to buy well earning and proven blue chip companies with this post, something that is simply not very volatile right? 

But the reason people are giving you a hard time here is because you literally (and accidentally i suppose) advertised for: buy high, sell low. I assume you are a long term holder of companies since you quoted buffet in this thread, but this is the exact opposite of what he would do.

The way you phrased it it sounds like you buy stocks when everything is fine and certain around a company and sell as soon as even the smallest uncertainty around it arises. 

I mean selling GE only because of a reverse stock split? really? why did you buy into it anyway if you had such a low conviction to hold this Company? Even Companies like Google or Visa have arguably higher uncertainties going on than this.

If you always start selling your companies as soon as stuff like this happens you are not going to make much money let alone outperform the market.",BlackOut7722,4,/r/stocks/comments/mg5nij/strategy_im_out_of_anything_that_looks_wonky/gsskt3x/,0.105,0.798,0.097,0.2755
139,GE, It sounds like you only want to buy when times are good and sell at the slightest uncertainty or when things get “wonky” and not just that but sell once the prices are already going down and deep red. “Uncertainty with China” is the reason you sold BABA? I don’t buy Chinese stocks for that reason but the uncertainty with China has always been here since 2008 so why did you even buy in the first place knowing that risk as been there for awhile. Out of GE because of a “wonky reverse stock split” like unless your a day trader this means nothing to a long term investor. If you believe in the company long term it doesnt really matter what they do with their stock. So once again why even buy in the first place. Also wont buy ARKK because of “wonky god talk”? The god talk has always been here for a long while ever since she first started managing money. Back in December and January this sub loved Cathie Wood and don’t you dare say anything bad or prepare for the downvotes or how she and her stocks are the future and people are holding long term. Now that the hype has died off because everyone turned against her now and are now bringing up “god talk” is the reason they sold and not because the stock is down over 30%. So much for the long term investing strategy and the future lol. The point is your post basically encourages a buy high sell low mentality. Like why even buy into these companies in the first place is my question if you are a long term investor?,JRshoe1997,1,/r/stocks/comments/mg5nij/strategy_im_out_of_anything_that_looks_wonky/gsswo9d/,0.069,0.834,0.098,0.8361

142,NIO," My reasoning has enough elements for me that I decided I could be wrong and feel good about selling NIO. There’s a chip shortage that’s going to affect production in the near term for months or years. There’s skepticism over Chinese reportings on earnings and the SEC is discussing removing those that don’t meet their standards over time. The CCP is known to be defensive over their financials. There are billion dollar hedge fund sell offs of Chinese stocks, which I’m told is unrelated and more to do with shorts. China as a whole has pressed political tensions with the world and the outlook is uncertain. They show aggression in the South China Sea standoffs with the US, with armed troops in India’s Himalayas and in Philippines fishing waters recently. The Uhghurs prison camps containing millions of Chinese minority Muslims that I’ve been aware of for a year or so are becoming internationally recognized as a modern day genocide. 

I bought in at like 45, some bought at 60, people said it’d go to 200 during the hype- but you know where it was for the past 20 years prior? Between a 1.5 and 15.

157,TSLA," “Trading at those prices based on other considerations” than the fundamentals is exactly where the wonkiness comes in.

What is belief in underlying tech actually worth? Will TSLA’s underlying tech generate the kind of revenue growth it takes to justify the massive valuation?

How much market share growth will TSLA be able to achieve once ev infrastructure takes hold and economy options comparable to the Honda Civic present themselves at much more accessible prices and locations? If tsla remains a niche higher-end vehicle, its uphill climb to justifying current valuations is already going to be difficult.

My wife has done business in China for many years with importation of reverse osmosis water filtration products and it’s like doing business anywhere else for the most part.

225,LEO," As usual when it comes to thinking about what the world will be like more than 1 year in the future people completely miss the point.

Ark’s space exploration ETF isn’t just about launchers.  It’s about which industries will benefit most greatly from the coming space technology convergence.  This will cause an exponential reduction in cost of payload to orbit, which will have many wide ranging effects.

Perfect example: Netflix.  Netflix has 200M customers today.  They’re close to reaching a saturation point whereby the only way they can continue to grow their subscriber base is by increasing the amount of bandwidth available to people across the globe.  Mega constellations like Starlink are poised to do just that.  This may double (or more) Netflix’s TAM which increases their scale, which lets them invest more efficiently and be more profitable.

This seems like an obvious space exploration play, and I’m not sure why people are having such a hard time seeing this.  If payload to LEO drops from $10,000 lbs/kg as it was in just the 2000’s to $10 lbs/kg as it is projected to in the next 5 years high bandwidth consuming content providers with massive scale will benefit immensely.",deadjawa,64,/r/stocks/comments/mgbnlp/is_ark_totally_crazy/gssgh1g/,0.024,0.822,0.153,0.9779

236,RL," RL is a far better space company than ARK, I say as someone who follows and understands space/rocketry more than the average person.  That doesn't mean that will translate into stock price on wall street, but they are fundamentally a sound company that can deliver with re-usability and can build their next rocket in a reasonable time frame.  They are a great stock for the next 2-5 years which I have invested what measly bits I can afford for this reason.  

Astra is another one, but is the opposite of RL, where RL has growth potential Astra has quick earnings potential.  RL has steady ability to send special cargo to specific orbits on your timeline for a higher price (later to send up constellation sats on a non-SpaceX, non-foreign launcher) than a ride share program, Astra is basically the cheapest quickest ways to get to orbit.

Astra uses the cheapest materials and technology to get to orbit with small payloads, RL uses the most advanced technology to send whatever will be the market demands in the future (trailing demand).

Astra will be winning contracts I believe (NASA shortly) and is liked by DOD because it can launch very quickly for cheap price (basically it an ICBM on a truck) where as RL has won launches from NASA by being able to handle scientific equipment and handle expensive long distance missions with their kickstage.

I haven't see any of that from Ark.  Honestly I haven't seen anything from Ark but Wallstreet information and promises, and the people from Wallstreet seem to have a record of falling through.  To me it seems like Ark is the first that will probably poison the well for investors to space because it will promise the moon and barely deliver.  What they want is SpaceX and without any knowledge of actual companies of rockety they are fleeced.  

And that is not new in the world of rocketry, it happens all the time where investors get sold a new company that make launches if they just invest their money, they just need more money to get it off the ground, just so more money.  Even Elon thought their company would fail because rockets are hard, even with former NASA people on his team.  I don't think WS will have the stomach for bleeding cashflow that will be required for Ark to be competitive compared to a solid business like RL or Astra who only need the money for R&D for next generation of rockets.",-spartacus-,-2,/r/stocks/comments/mgbnlp/is_ark_totally_crazy/gstdp3y/,0.029,0.835,0.136,0.9934

I'm a big fan of any ETF staying true to their actual purpose or at least general investment ethos. Here, the ethos seems to be wacky.

In case of an inflationary hedge, why not use short term money funds or similar ""safe positions"", if you want to call them safe, of course. Safer than cash, let's say in case you expect inflation surging. 

So, yes, I'm aware it might be better to use NFLX in terms of (short term) monetary appreciation - but also: who knows in this crazy valuated market with strange single stock movements flaring up everywhere (and tech broadly tanking), with super high current P/E's over 25-30 and high forward P/Es north of 50? 

NFLX current P/E 80 (!), fwd P/E > 50! 

So: Who says NFLX can't and won't tank to a current P/E of, say 45.3 and a fwd P/E of more reasonable 21.8, soon? I know it's only 1.2 % of stated holdings currently. That does not make the question or train of thought invalid, though.

249,LEO," > RedWire (GNPK)

Well I can't say that I knew much if anything about them before you asked, however I can say I know these points of information on a trend-line if these things continue.

* SpaceX's Starship whose development I follow will within a year or two be capable of launching millions of tons into LEO very cheaply each year
* NASA is now planning on doing a solicitation for designs for a new space station https://futurism.com/the-byte/nasa-offers-400-million-companies-build-new-space-stations?fbclid=IwAR3w6LUy1mKL6v-lGpAyRAOdrrCmB-dHqvUL_h_6IN2J7eXYk6dsJWcd0J8
* NASA's new space station is planned to be built using private-public partnerships like it has done with the previous COTS/Crew/Lunar programs (selecting winners and providing awards)
* SpaceX plans to send its colonists to Mars with 3d printers and harvest resources to save weight to build the colonies

From what I can see RedWire would fill that gap, SpaceX aims to be more the railroad and telephone company in this scenario rather than trying to be everything.  Redwire would be filling that gap with their technology that would work well with a partnership with both SpaceX, NASA, and other space companies when working in space.

I do not know anything about their fundamental technology or about leadership or their finances, only that their goal of their company is at least aiming for a necessary open marketplace in the future should these key points continue to stay open as well.  Should NASA get a change in direction and SpaceX have to go alone, should SpaceX have to fight tooth and nail with the FAA for every launch making their prototype testing a serious hassle, then that could change.

I would say try to find 3rd printing board and some experts if they have any opinion on the company or something along those lines.  Typically you can get a feel for companies baselines from field experts.",-spartacus-,3,/r/stocks/comments/mgbnlp/is_ark_totally_crazy/gstgjbl/,0.02,0.92,0.06,0.8957

251,CLPS," Reading a little bit more, I found out that they have acquired several smaller companies (basically a merger between a group of them) that have won contracts on CLPS and other things.  Their focus is on doing things in space, deep space, which is exactly where the government and private can make money right now, not in launching which is very niche with SpaceX domination (which you have my writeup on already).

So I was slightly off with the 3d printing thing, they may go that route, but they are 100% going to be bidding on that new NASA space station and have experience doing so.  I don't know if they are worth the $10 it is now (I have a feeling it may drop below after merger unless a deal were to be announced).

However, they are in a great position for the commercialization of space with space tugs, stations, and transit in between (docking, maintenance, human activity, etc) there are lots of parts their companies they merged with make and can make as part of contracts.

The main sticking point is, is it worth $10 a share?

>Redwire has proven revenue-generating power, with projected 2021 revenue of $163 million, and many of the companies now operating under its umbrella are fairly mature and have been operating cash flow positive for many years.

There are investment research firms who rate stocks solely on TA and nothing else and consistently pick the winners. Marketedge for example had a buy rating on GME since august last year at $4.

In current market environment i picked up stocks  that have given over 100% return in couple months based only on TA. Eg REI and SRPT.

I'm not saying any of this is ethical or how things should be (on the contrary, I think it's horrible and should be changed, and I think there needs to be a lot more advocacy for financial rights of disabled people), but:

Depending on the jurisdiction:

- you may not even be allowed to have $5K in cash (for example, in parts of Canada, if the disability office finds out you've managed to save up cash, or someone has gifted you something valuable, they cut off your benefits to force you to spend it)

- if you start making money, you may get kicked off your financial assistance (for example in the UK, if you're on benefits and they find out you had any kind of paying job, they kick you off benefits and it takes 6 months to reapply, even if your job was temporary and isn't paying you any more)

- in the US you may make just enough money to lose access to healthcare

- be careful of how your financial situation affects family members - for example, in Canada if a person on disability is married to someone else who gets a paying job or has other sources of money, they lose their disability benefits because the system assumes the spouse makes enough money to support them both

325,AI," The issue with paper trading vs real trading is actually volume. The methods you stick to are going to *have* to change when you enter the market with real money. I was where you were with paper trading. Heck I was where you were even trading real capital for a while. But something I don't see anyone talking about is how liquidity kind of...shifts as soon as you enter your trades on the tape. This is especially a major issue now with volume and liquidity being sucked right out of the market. Because now you're exposed on the tape and I can (and have) learned how to not play the price, but the people on the other side of my trades. It becomes less of a skill of data analytics and becomes more of a skill of things you'd use in a game of poker.

Also *because* I've been where you are I know you won't actually believe what I'm telling you until you experience it yourself, and that's fine. I'm just letting you know that it'll happen and maybe having that in the back of your head will help you when you get to a certain level.

Basically what I'm saying is that paper trading is easy for the same reason playing against AI on a computer is way easier than playing pvp in any given video game. The situation and game looks identical, but what happens and how we can cause others to tilt on purpose when we throw an unexpected move at each other fundamentally changes and snowballs your approach to the game everytime.",ckam87,3,/r/stocks/comments/mgjo3t/i_feel_nauseated_because_im_making_money/gsub3ki/,0.017,0.9,0.083,0.9577

A lot of people don't understand what it means to be disabled and live way below the poverty line for their entire lives, ""just get a job"" isn't in the cards, especially when you have multiple disabilities. Employers will straight up hang up on you during a interview as soon as you tell them your disabled and need accommodations. Never at any point did I have hope of having my own place until now. This is the 1 thing I CAN do, with ease at that!

431,IRS," Hey happy to help. 

**First thing's first - make sure you contribute before May 17th**! I know you said you're contributing in April, but I urge you to make sure you don't put it off, as the May 17th deadline is final for 2020 contributions. Usually the annual deadline falls on April 15th, but the IRS has extended it this year in an effort to provide relief. 

Additionally, you can contribute a maximum of $6,000 to a Roth IRA every year, so while I like your plan to add money out of each paycheck, **I recommend you add as much money as you possibly can right now!** Even if you don't have $6k right now or even close to it, **contribute as much money as you can budget for the 2020 tax year**, and you'll be very happy you did. Then for the rest of the year you can start contributing out of each paycheck for the 2021 tax year!

As for the portfolio breakdown:

* Originally (last year when I started the Roth IRA) my **target** allocation was as follows:
   * 40% Total Market (VTI)
   * 35% Growth (VUG)
   * 25% Tech (VGT)
* In the past couple of months, I decided to add the **crypto** funds to my retirement account, so I amended the **target allocation** percentages to the following:
   * **Four-way even split (25%) between Total Market, Growth, Tech, and Crypto**
   * To breakdown the cryptos, the target split between the two is **75% Bitcoin, 25% Ethereum (20% and 5% of the total portfolio, respectively).**
* Since the values are constantly changing, and  because I had some cash in the account waiting to purchase, the **ACTUAL** percentage break down is currently:
   * 24% Total Market (VTI)
   * 22% Tech (VGT)
   * 20% Cash
   * 19% Growth (VUG)
   * 12% Bitcoin (GBTC)
   * 3% Ethereum (ETHE)

You want to limit the extent to which you exit just before big rises or to which you exit after a stock was found to be overvalued and dropped.

Do the ETFs for general growth like people said but if you're still interested in some level of risk then make two or three mental slots in your head for companies that you will invest in after doing due diligence. Personally evaluate them based on their financials, their potential for growth, the experience and success of their executives, etc. No dogecoin, no AMC, no Palantir, unless/until you've evaluated those for yourself and you are satisfied that there is a real thesis for them and that you are going to be able to tell what price to exit at",PeliPal,2,/r/stocks/comments/mg4mug/so_i_dont_have_much_to_invest_and_i_dont/gsrarro/,0.066,0.743,0.191,0.9822
455,IMO," No.   You're doing this wrong IMO and there's alot of boring advice from guys who shouldnt be trading and should just throw their $ into $SPY because they probably wont beat it.. Learn SOME fundamental and technical analysis. Education it's free with Prof. Google.  Don't over diversify. Find your companies that have potential for growth and a sound balance sheet, and preferably with healthy volatility such as cyclicals. If you're in for the long game buy all the dips. Once you get an understanding of fluctuations over days/weeks/months/years you'll be better at predicting highs and low.  At that point have an entry and exit strategy. But what do i know I've only made 6x profit on original investment and 130% YTD. You cannot control the market,  just your risk/reward tolerance.  

I started off like you,  having alittle bit of money in alot of stocks and had virtually no gains my first year. Good luck!",aisleorisle,1,/r/stocks/comments/mg4mug/so_i_dont_have_much_to_invest_and_i_dont/gsrupbe/,0.07,0.76,0.17,0.9483
456,BB," This is exactly me right now. Just starting, just learning. While I am following the great /stocks sages advice of reading the learner links I still wanted to have a little play in the mean time. Just to get a feel, to learn to watch red days and not panic. To learn not to watch that stock app every 5 minutes. One of the first things I did learn lurking in /Stocks is this is not just financial stress, it's also psychological.    
    
So being small time and wanting to avoid as many commision's as possible I signed up to eToro (took 30+ days to validate, not 3 pffft). Took £1k from an  unexpected bonus I didn't budget for and can afford to loose (This is still a lot of money for me, so 'can loose' is relative to the 'unexpected' part) and threw it into the App. Currently only half of this is allocated. Dipping my toe so to speak.    
My aim at the moment/next few months? Try to make more than my bank account will give me and to learn. After that I'll want to be doing more. At that point I'll want to be doing my own DD's and looking hard at ETF's etc aswell. I want to be able to look at sites like Macroaxis and have it all make sense, not just the jist of it.    
    
Where am I now?    
    
A bunch of shares in SNX.  - Why? I work for them and believe in the company. I'm not high level, just shop-floor and thankfully have no insider info. I like how the company is run, I like the commitment from those around me. In at sub 100, I've seen nothing but green.    
    
A bunch in RR.L -  Again a company I like and believe in. In at sub 106, this is a long play. A lot of their income comes from flight time, once things start to normalize I expect his to rise.    
    
A couple in CRSR - I like and always have liked their product. In at sub 32. No DD, pure emotion buy...cuz it was cheap :)    
    
Couple in CCL - Total gamble, in at sub 24. (Missed the 'boat' on this one due to eToro validation time, watched it rise 40% in my virtual account). No logic to this, but people are not logical so meh. This will either Phoenix or go Bankrupt. This one was a lesson I chose to teach myself about FOMO.    
    
Couple in BB - I believe this company has a future, and its defo a long play. In a bit high, just over 11. This will probably settle about 9 (+- .50) in my uneducated opinion. If it gets to 8.5 i'll get a few more to even me out then sit on it for a year.    
    
A few in PLTR - In at 26, just before the tech dive. A lesson in meme stock learnt. Uneducated guess will settle above 20, prob 21-22. No friggin idea what to do with it now.    
    
After the last few weeks of stocks bouncing around my account has pretty much been about the -3% mark. Worst day -4%, currently at -2%. I see that as OK considering.

Youre gambling and not making a well informed decision.  Investing in stocks require a well informed decision and in my opinion youre barely even scratching the surface of research.  Youre probably not even sure where to begin.  All thats okay, youre starting somewhere, but why jump in the tank when you dont even know how to swim? Sure you may know how to float, but the market isnt exactly stable.

Also, if youre in the USA, open a roth or ira first. I dont suggest trading in one, but you can trade in there if so desired.

514,HP," If you're referring to cars on HP from a garage/dealership through a financing company, the 'family of 5' who are paying for the car don't actually own it. In the case that they can't pay back the loan, the car is returned to the financing company who will sell it and it'll be cost-neutral. 

If you mean people taking out bank loans and using the stimulus cheque as a deposit for example, the bank should have done their due diligence as to whether the person being given the loan is in a suitable position. That includes whether their income will continue. If the person can't pay, there are already systems in place that allow money or assets to be removed to offset the loan. 

In either case, the financiers are insured twice basically. Once because they have such a vast expanse of people who are paying to them, if a small percentage default, it doesnt affect the whole operation. And secondly by typical insurance. 

The companies that would suffer if in 4 years time the loans systems collapsed are the small local firms who actually probably don't do their own distribution of loans because that needs a huge amount of capital, and also are probably small enough that they dont distribute shares anyway",londxncalling,11,/r/stocks/comments/mgmz3r/how_do_i_short_the_automobile_finance_industry/gstzh5z/,0.035,0.925,0.04,-0.2491

524,CP," Humans,  they really are unpredictable.   In your example,  before the final earnings announcement,  it could be trading at $14 because of the uncertainty,  like you said,  or it could be trading at $16 because people like the company and may believe they were sand bagging expectations and were going to announce improvements by 60%.  

In reality,  as it gets closer to the announcement,  it should trade very near $15.  Why, well,  one answer is that the uncertainty discount and hope/hype will cancel each other out.  Another big reason is that there are professional traders whose job is to know.   I'll bet you're good at your job,  if your full time job was to analyze this particular company, you'd know.  They look at things like how many trucks full of materials to build the stuff arrived and calculate how much production from that,  or perhaps how many hours the management car spends in the lot (normal hours means things are going well).  These are the people who use satellite images to look at how many open parking spaces there are to get an idea of the change in same stone sales so important to retail metrics.

527,DCF," Priced in is very subjective and it can be seen from two perspectives: the future cash flows, the discount rate, which is a proxy for the risk of investing in the company, and the growth rate. To determine whether something is priced in, you have to do a reverse DCF i.e. what the implied growth rate is when you fix the expected cash flows/discount rate, or the implied discount rate when you fix the growth rate/expected cash flows.

As an example, say a regulator announces that they are looking into Company A for Violation X. Typically, when a company breaks this specific regulation, they are typically fined $1 billion. Market participants start to assign probabilities on different amounts. When the regulator announces this, the market cap of Company A may drop by $1 billion, by more or by less.

Your job is to determine what the expected fine will be (say you expect $1 billion); if the price drops more than $1 billion, you can say that the fine is 'priced in'. If you have a strong conviction on your estimate, then there is an additional return you can generate if you invest at that price if your estimate is correct. If the market cap drops less than $1 billion, you might say that the fine is 'not priced in' and you won't buy at these prices.

Note that in this example, it's a one-off event and it's much simpler to visualise, but irl market participants have assumptions on trends, future cash flows, growth rates, discount rates etc. which all change dynamically as the market moves forward.",simonkesterlian,1,/r/stocks/comments/mg2g8o/some_clarity_on_what_is_meant_when_something_is/gss18wm/,0.019,0.913,0.068,0.8807

Apparently got caught up in the Bill Hwang's Archegos Capital Management family investment vehicle short covering scandal on Monday.  


I was surprised to see the RKT block trades executed at a premium as everything else liquidated went for a discount.  Likely caused the nice, but momentary  price spike up on Monday.


I'm not recommending the stock although I own some.  I'm undecided on my investment in RKT because I'm still cannot figure out the complexity of this holding companies share classes. 


At any rate, very interesting read for any RKT owners or anyone considering a purchase:

594,TFSA," I'm 20, I work full time and am also paid weekly. I also live with my parents and have almost no bills, (300-400$ a month?). I started investing just before the covid crash as I nearly 30k in my savings from when I was in high school buying and selling things on ROBLOX for usd, invested most of my money during March and April of last year, so in retrospect a great time. I maxed out my TFSA (I'm Canadian) and that has since seen a 125% return last year and then I started investing the rest into a regular account. I'm saving up for a mortgage on a triplex right now so for me personally I try to keep 10k$ in my bank at any given time and I've been trying not to invest it into the stock market until after I get into a triplex, but man it's been difficult to not invest it lately, that's all I want to do haha. 

If I were you I'd consider a similar path and invest in real estate, but if you're not interested in that then I would still try to bolster the savings up a bit while also investing. Maybe do a 50/50 split until you get to 7-10k in savings just as a safety margin (maybe parents might lose job and need help, who knows).",SorrowsSkills,4,/r/stocks/comments/mgjw9b/am_i_doing_it_right_or_should_i_tone_it_down/gstjn91/,0.058,0.872,0.069,0.5254

I am also bullish on Disney, but if you're saying that they proved their credibility with COVID safety with the NBA and that will translate to safety and protocol following for visitors... That's just a terrible conclusion. 

The NBA bubble has zero connection to how COVID will be handled with visitors. Zero. It was a bubble. With a professional sports organization making the rules about it. Neither of those are true for visitors in their parks. 

Limited staff and building maintenance crews were the only ones involved in the bubble - a fraction of the staff needed to run parks fully.

626,AAPL," Personally, I do not care if a shoeshine boy gives me investment advice. I'm not a pro. I think the ease of trading now has made it so the shoeshine boy can talk about stocks, which I think is a net positive. The downside is people expect massive gains in a short period of time.

That means the education is pretty poor, as most people just see massive gains with options online, and are trying to emulate the same results.  Or don't realize some posting huge gains are scams seeking membership fees/class fees or pumps. I've had some friends who have YOLO'd their accounts, and obviously it did not work out well. 

&#x200B;

Back in 2015 when I started seriously investing, the sentiment was the same about the market crashing but the boogie man was different. It was raising rates then. I started way earlier than that, but I just bought stuff I knew and honestly did no DD. Actually it was very similar to this time, oil and commodities were on fire. 

Regarding tech, I agree, some of it is overvalued. Some companies are way overvalued their current evaluation. However, back then they were saying TSLA and AAPL were way overvalued and their crash was impending. Now it is sort of an overall sentiment that AAPL is a safe haven for funds. I believe the reason for is most importantly the ability to acquire companies. Free cash flow makes a big deal. Part of the bear stance I read for tech back then is these companies need to always innovate, which I have come to realize isn't true.

Regarding tech, I agree, some of it is overvalued. Some companies are way overvalued their current evaluation.

Does it have a reason to be more than say 7% higher than 2019 market cap?   Did they make more subscriptions,  or raise prices to make more per subscriptions?

I almost feel bad for Archegos.  They were undone because Viacom saw the run up and decided to sell stock which caused this whole disaster.

A lot of times you will see a big, violent bounce after something sells off this hard (especially since the sell-off was caused by a margin call on a large shareholder - essentially an unlikely to be repeated event). It should see the 60’s again very soon. I would sell it there and look again in 6-12 months once this rotation into cyclicals and value stocks has gotten a little farther into its move.
