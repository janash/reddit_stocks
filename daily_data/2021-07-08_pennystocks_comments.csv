The state of Florida and Iowa have contracted UAVS to track their hemp crops. I think UAVS (AgEagle will be adopted by other states as well) Besides that there's a plethora of other things the company has going for it. Honestly (imo) think now is a pretty good buy in point - here's a comment a made to someone a little while ago:

Hello! With the CEO Brandon Torres Declet from the recently purchased company Measure - $UAVS is well positioned to compete and win in the drone industry. Measure brings with it a slew of companies and now with the censor technology from MicaSense (now also an AgEagle UAVS company) and the means to produce drones, I believe that ,and this is just all an opinion, that AgEagle will yet again BIG increase in revenue!

AgEagle has contracts with both Iowa and Florida dealing with hemp (this will probably extend to other states as state laws change regarding hemp)

This is the opposite direction of what the legalization process will look like, IMO.  Common sense and user experience would suggest a strong backlash to something most people find insignificant, that being high on cannabis.

51,THC," With Alcohol Breathalysers, the way it works is essentially that alcohol comes from your blood into your lungs at a known and consistent rate.  The machine knows that rate and can work out from the proportion of alcohol in your breath, how much is in your blood, which in turn gets used as a measure of how pissed you are. 

Alcoholics are the exception to the rule because they have a particular tolerance that’ll mean they score sky high, but still function better than most would.  Most people fit within a certain range, according to which a limit is set in law. 

I can’t see this being all too different.  

Once the THC gets metabolised, it won’t be in your breath any longer. 

The only risk is the same one that currently exists with alcohol breathalysers…. Doing a test a very short time after consumption and getting a falsely-high reading because the substance is still in abundance in your mouth and GI tract from the beer, joint, whatever. 

Don’t be fooled into thinking that it’s ok because loads of people do it.  I’ve seen THC on Toxicology reports on more fatal collisions than I can count.  More often then not; they’ve died as a result of a shitty decision they made at the wheel.  THC impairs you to one extent or another; it’s undeniable.  It’s the amount to which it impairs you that’ll change from person to person.

Definitely a super unique corporate strategy and over the past few months of me following them, they have taken serious actionable steps to progress their business model. From a research perspective, their CSO's CV is incredible. He has over 100 publications in accredited medical journals like Nature and Lancet and I think the research being done out of the University of British Columbia is underappreciated as the company progresses through clinical trials versus research being conducted somewhere in the Caribbean. They have 10 years of research supporting the claims being made and although they may seem outlandish, there is definitely scientific support backing it up. The stock is definitely underperforming and was overvalued at the $2 price point but the $1 range has increased volume, is a more accurate assessment of where the company currently is and I'm personally really excited to see where this company can take it!
