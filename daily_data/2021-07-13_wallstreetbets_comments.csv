198,SAFE," Just know that the true long play here is US MSOs (multistate operators), not Canadian LPs. Sure LPs ran up from election and senate run off, but not because of fundamentals. It‚Äôs misinformed retail investors. Which can be the case again for sure, not disagreeing with you. Just know it‚Äôs for the wrong reasons and won‚Äôt be sustainable long-term. 

US MSOs are growing 100%+ YoY and the top 4 are well on their way to surpassing $1B+ revenue in 2021 or 2022, yet they have lower multiples than Canadian LPs who can list on US exchanges. They are doing just fine without fed legalization, but there‚Äôs a few factors explained below on why MSOs can rocket. The reality is LPs are burning up cash, barely growing, and have a tiny TAM in Canada yet are valued significantly higher. That won‚Äôt be the case if/when the inevitable happens. 

Fed legalization or a pivot to SAFE will likely result in a few key catalysts. First is the removal of 280e. MSOs can‚Äôt write off business expenses like normal companies, this will open up a lot of capital to further accelerate growth. 

Next is the opportunity to access banking and more affordable capital. 

Lastly, the opportunity to uplist on US exchanges which will open up volume on both the retail and institutional sides. Institutions have to sit on the sidelines on MSOs and some have even made plays and had to liquidate because of compliance reasons. Volume is also too low with the current exchanges these MSOs are forced to list on (Canadian pink sheets). 

People will eventually learn while everyone was looking at Sundial and Tilray, there were $1B+ in revenue cannabis businesses growing like all hell right here in the US that they never even heard about due to its exchange listing.",SomeHand9182,11,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ojiap1/marijuana_bill_being_introduced_july_14th/h51yz4i/,0.072,0.781,0.147,0.9683

463,MVIS, Well a company that is as old as MVIS it actually matters. They are pioneers with their tech. They went through the dot com bubble. Their tech was way ahead of the times. They are just now being able to tap into these new emerging markets via mixed reality and AR( MVIS is the core of Microsoft‚Äôs hOLolens 2)  and safe mobility(long range Lidar). Their MEMS tech and I think like over 50 patents they have(could be wrong) are impressive. There are so many companies publishing patents related to MEMS now it‚Äôs insane. But if you look at MVIS past revenue it looks bad I admit. But with these emerging markets I like to think about MVIS as a r&d startup just now realizing it‚Äôs true market value.

1) Tesla was growing rapidly throughout the past decade. MVIS is shrinking.

2) Tesla's price to sales ratio never got above 30 from 2011 on. MVIS has a P/S ratio of around 1000. Meaning the company is valued at 1000 (!) times what it takes in each year as revenue. This isn't even considering profit, which MVIS has no plan for ever obtaining.

703,AMC," I think we talked last month. I've been shorting since the start of June.

I've watched most of Trey's Trades, Matt Kohrs and Roesnch Capital every time they release a new video, hyping AMC. 

The faith is mainly focused on the expectation that shorts eventually have to cover, and that there are at least 90-100 million shorted shares. The argument is AMC has gotten stronger recently, so that the probability of bankruptcy (price to $0) has shrunk drastically, therefore shorts do indeed have to cover if they want out in the near term.

So my strategy plays around taking advantage of their exuberant firm belief of the short squeeze. Knowing that a vast majority of them will not sell and will likely unload as much of their next paycheck into more AMC stock, the best strategy is to bet a slow ladder grind down, with some upwards breakthroughs (that may turn dangerous).

I've been selling OTM puts while holding onto my short position on the way down, but I'm planning to cover the short soon and sell both OTM puts and OTM call spreads (need the upwards protection). Currently up 7k, but planning on taking as much money from the apes as possible, as safely as possible.",beer_flu_reborn,8,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ojcg2b/daily_popular_tickers_thread_for_july_13_2021/h529om9/,0.008,0.895,0.096,0.9317

780,SPCE," Buy the rumor, sell the news. The rumor was this space flight with Bronson on board, which led up to the stock's major run. The news was yesterday with the successful space flight. Combined with understanding that a stock can only run up so much, regardless of real world facts and fundamentals, it seemed clear to me that SPCE would be coming back down today, even with the successful flight.

Also important to remember that Wall Street generally likes companies who beat earnings rather than companies who speculate they'll be generating profits somewhere down the road.

I'm not trying to be a dick here, and I'm also pretty new to investing, so I'm not trying to come off as an expert, but the massive run-up leading to this, plus a company that is still pretty speculative had me thinking this was going to be a ""sell the news"" thing. I was watching SPCE today in case it popped, but I didn't think it would because of the above.

Again, not trying to say that I'm smarter than you and not trying to shit on you or anything, but use this as a ""buy the rumor, sell the news"" example.

944,VG," SpaceShip One: first spaceflight 2003

SpaceShip Two: first spaceflight 2018, three more after including this one

Even IF they were able to get SS2 anywhere near the operation pace they'd need to come close to breaking even in the next decade, Branson himself admits that scaling up from SS1 to SS2 was vastly more difficult than they anticipated, and it took 15 years to get to a near-produxtion vehicle. 

There's absolutely no reason to believe that scaling this design up further wouldn't be just as, if not more difficult. Adding many more people or going point to point is not a trivial task, and would require essentially a clean sheet design, not to mention the regulatory issues (which are enormous and also not trivial since their design may fundamentally not be certifiable in the current landscape). Additionally, there's no indication that VG has designed this rocket to be serviceable over the long term, and has no operational experience that informs potential long-life issues - hell, they had a major structural failure on just their second flight of VSS Unity that could have caused another in-flight breakup. 

On top of the difficulties of getting the commuter point-to-point design to work, why would anyone risk their life on an experimental vehicle and pay an order of magnitude more money to shave a few hours off a normal airplane flight that's basically guaranteed to be safe? Modern aircraft are safe because thousands of people had to die over the last century for us to learn our lessons and improve designs and regulations to meet acceptable levels of risk. 

I believe that point to point suborbital travel will probably become a thing at some point in the 21st century, but I don't think VG has the team or design to make it happen before they run out of money.

*""Futures are flat overnight holding 4377. We see little change in gamma levels, with 4350-4400 the main range into Fridays OPEX. With that our model forecasts a very small max move today of 76bps/33pts. 4384 shows as a very large Combo Strike which may be a decent ‚Äúfair value‚Äù/pivot reference for today.""*

*""As we grind toward the Friday OPEX we note that our intraday volatility metrics are once again pushing lows. This is seen in the middle chart wherein the ‚Äúcompression‚Äù reading is back to a historic lower bound. This is aligning perfectly with a ‚Äúrelease‚Äù post-OPEX.  What is equally interesting here is that realized volatility (bottom chart) is well off of the lows seen at the start of July.""*

Food is being hit by draughts and input costs.

Today was a strong performance and it‚Äôs done very well after the sell off, especially since the CFO sold off some shares- I believe 50k shares a couple weeks ago. 

As far as AH, it usually trades so sideways and with little to no volume AH that I reckon it was just a heavy sell there for whatever reason. I‚Äôm not concerned right now though, it seems to have a lot of support anywhere sub 40. On that dip RSI reached 23. They should have their biggest quarter to date coming up, people have a newfound love for the outdoors and firearms. These guys kill it in those areas.

1184,EA," As a gamer, I loathe that jerk off for nickel and diming unsuspecting kids for their parents hard earned cash so they can get the latest ""skins pack"". He promised to take the fun out of game development citing the fact that it's easier to keep control of a depressed work group.
Since his take over of infinity ward and treyarch studios, most of the original developers of the call of duty series left or were muscled out. The original leads of IW ended up at EA under their new studio 'Respawn'.
I'm concerned about his ethics driving away talent at both Blizzard and Activision by churning out bug filled garbage and zero control over the hackers in warzone that are also call of duty partners streaming their content daily. There's zero chance the young adults and teens that like, subscribe, and use creator codes for these cosmetics purchases understand they may be buying into subliminal advertising to be just like ""x"". When in reality the skins do nothing and they are likely using some 3rd party hacking tool to keep the wins coming. There's also talk of a ""whitelist"" all cod partners are on to ensure they never have connection issues to the servers. This also means they are not subject to being reported for any cheating or exploiting by other players. Cod partners accounts have been permanently banned during waves of automated hacker bans, and they just created a new account and moved on like nothing happened. (Symfhuny)

They even fucking rerelease wow, slap wow classic on it and call it brand new. Look at the recent crashbandicot remake, it was a huge success and was good, Diablo 2 remastered look like a good nostalgia bait after diablo mobile, Overwatch 2 ... well, still gonna bait so much people.
