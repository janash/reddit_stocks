18,SNDL," You can do this, but you're not exactly coming out on top if your shares get called away. Let's look at the option you spoke of, the SNDL 6/18 50c call.

You own 100 shares which are at $1.06 right now. Cost you $106 to buy the shares.

Sell the call, collect $55 in premium. If that call ends up in the money and your shares are called away, you sell your 100 shares for $50. Net return is $105. You paid $106. 

If you're looking to consistently farm premium, probably stick with your current strategy.",Itsboomhomie,1,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/nx2b67/daily_discussion_thread/h1ed0e9/,0.0,0.847,0.153,0.9349

They're going to need capital, so expect further dilution.
