9,OR," I'm not in the play, but find it so odd they don't have a plan prepared BEFORE starting to drill.  If you know what you are doing you should have had a plan A, B, and C.  That is what experience teaches you in any occupation.

A couple of questions:

1.  I might have missed it but why not just drill next to the one that they just did?
2. I thought I read somewhere the reason the well went down the tubes is they went with a cheap drill?  Was that confirmed?  If so, why don't they just do the above with a better rig OR just don't go down far enough.

There is something I am missing as the next step does not seem complicated?

Thanks in advance.",10xwannabe,5,/r/pennystocks/comments/p4tn0u/heliumone_hlogfhe1_first_well_results_and_next/h918sit/,0.138,0.815,0.047,-0.8866
10,ALL," Actually it is that easy.  You move the rig over and just do the same thing.  It is done ALL the time in drilling when you lose a well.

The issue it sounds is NOT a science related issue, but a company centric issue regarding the rig.  If the issue is the rig then to try the current rig on a different hole at the same TD they were aiming for the first time wouldn't make sense as you may get the same result.  Then, of course, the company doesn't want to upset SP by telling everyone there will be a delay waiting for a new rig.  Sounds like stuck between a rock and a hard place so to speak.

My guess, the company already knows they made the mistake with the drill selection and that was the issue (not sure why they went so cheap considering they say they have money+ knowing ahead of time they can't easily change drills if something goes wrong).  They will likely drill next to this one at a shallower level and hope for the best.  Hopefully, at the same time spend some money and get a REAL rig shipped without telling the investors as not to cause panic.

Curious, what is the experience in drilling from the CEO?  He seems WAY young, but that could just be me getting old. :)",10xwannabe,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/p4tn0u/heliumone_hlogfhe1_first_well_results_and_next/h91bh30/,0.101,0.758,0.141,0.9538

They announced a merger agreement with Global Green Energy Acquisition Corp.

28,HUGE," Who knows, but it fits in a situation you can see a company succeeding. 

1.  They are in a field with a HUGE TAM.
2. They are low in that totem pole (so a lot of room to move up)
3. They have something that would indicate they have a chance of taking market share since they help marketing better (more revenue) and cheaper then their competitors.  If you are a CEO why would you NOT try them out.  Who would pay MORE in advertising budget for worse results??

Definite biggest problem is patience.  Not easy to start taking market share for any company so just need to give time.  I figure by end of 2022 it should start really seeing some forward momentum.",10xwannabe,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/p4xehu/inuvo_inuv_first_in_class_ai_ml_for_advertising/h92nhjw/,0.104,0.711,0.185,0.9153
29,HUGE," No if this stock makes it or not will be decided in the next 2-5 years.  It will either make it or will fall flat based on its legacy Validclick business.  I do agree (as I noted) this is a multiyear play, but the HUGE potential of multi bagging makes it worth it (at least to me).

Sorry you bought at the height.  Never buy when something is exploding.  For any new investors forget to even mention it seemed to jump earlier in the years as it was discovered Blackrock and Vanguard bought into the stock. Which is not too common for them to buy into a such as small stock (probably around 50 million market cap at that time).

So either Blackrock and Vanguard are correct or you are correct.  Guess we will find out. :)",10xwannabe,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/p4xehu/inuvo_inuv_first_in_class_ai_ml_for_advertising/h91zg2q/,0.037,0.867,0.096,0.8573
30,AI," Same I have been watching this one.  MOST stocks have been getting KILLED after even great ER so I thought the same would happen here.  It only went down 5% or so.  So figured this is about as low as I can expect to go anytime soon so just bought in as I plan on holding for 2-5 years to give them time to get established and see if they take off and grow into a big player.  

Tech industry, undervalued valuations (<2x revenue by end of 2021),  AI/ML, low market cap, and near low entrance point last 1-3 months was enough for me to go for it.
