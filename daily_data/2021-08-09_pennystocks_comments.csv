The only reason I know is I was going to buy a little more to try and lower my cost basis and Fidelity wouldn't let me because of it. When I did some investigating I found some news/posts from BLDV saying they were aware of the problem and were fixing it. Last time I looked they were again current. 

So it could be that the stock was current, people were buying, and then it went CE. You can check stocks on otcmarkets.com and actually you can go to BLDV on there and look under disclosure and see their attorney's letter with respect to current information on otcmarkets.

As the stock is listed under ""PINK SHEET"", I have to figure in TD Ameritrade's non NYSE exchange fee (+maintenance fee) to determine if its something that would be cost beneficial, or if the length of holding would negate any profits netted from the maintenance fees.

From my DD sheet please see Estimated Life (years): 20. The dividend could be paid over a 20 year period, and when compared to other Oil & Gas stocks paying a dividend, the $1.85 is the ""up to"" price per share should FECOF pay a dividend which is 75% of the income net of expenses (see below) and net of production share (see below).

100,ARC," I hate posting Imgur links, so I made this an image post and am putting the DD below.

**Intro**

Last month I decided to try an experiment: trade a stock that is trading in a channel and see if I can realize a small, low-risk profit. My plan was to buy near the bottom of the channel and sell near the top. The stock I chose was ARC. I‚Äôm sharing this here because it worked and because I think the stock could go higher Monday.

**Fundamentals**

ARC Document Solutions, Inc. is a ‚Äúdocument printing solutions‚Äù company. It‚Äôs quoted as ARC on the NASDAQ/NYSE. It has 3.53 book/share and 1.26 cash/share and a float of 35 million. As of Friday, it was trading at 2.65. Unlike most pennies, ARC is profitable, a dividend stock and its public float has actually shrunk.

**The Trade**

I bought a small position in ARC on July 17th at 1.97/share. I set a GTC order to sell at 2.39. That order executed on August 4th.

**Analysis**

I bought just below the channel, predicting the stock would not go much lower. The stock followed my thesis and slowly moved to my profit target. I also predicted the following:

* If it moves past 2.4, it could go to 2.6.
* If it goes past 2.6, it could go to 2.7.
* If it moves above 2.7, it could go to 3.
* If it goes above 3, it could go to 5.
* Past 5, it could go to 10.

Friday it went as high as 2.7 before moving back to 2.65. I figure it will either continue its upward trend this week or it will stay true to form and start its decline back to the bottom of the channel. I don‚Äôt have a bias toward either scenario.
