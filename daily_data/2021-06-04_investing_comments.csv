18,UE," What's interesting is that this is basically a giant experiment. Roughly Half of states(red states) ending unemployment benefits, half of states(blue states) keeping them.

In a couple months we can look at the data and see if cutting off extended unemployment benefits actually improved the unemployment situation, if it did nothing, or if it made things worse, relative to states that kept them going.

I'm sure higher UE benefits are reducing incentive to go back to work, but there are certainly more factors than just unemployment benefits. Other sources of unemployment:

1. Structural unemployment. People with specific skills that were in demand before the pandemic might have trouble finding work, and not want to take a lesser paying job that doesn't use their skill set.

2. School closures. With childcare being unaffordable, some lower income parents are probably in no hurry to find work due to schools still being remote. Hopefully in the fall this will be back to normal.

3. Fears of pandemic likely also kept people out of the labor force, but hopefully vaccinations should be addressing this.

4. Early retirement due to layoffs.

Me yesterday when I saw the news: ugh.

Also, as I noted below, this is simply a stake in something that other public companies - Vivendi and Tencent - have a significant stake in already. I have no interest in investing in music, but even if I did why do I want this when I can own it via Tencent's diversified array of investments?

Apparently you're also getting remainco + SPARC, but I don't know this Universal deal is not that encouraging a start at least for me. Given the fact that PSTH is down 10% pre-market though I guess I'm not alone in my view.

30,AMC," Good morning contrarians!

Not much doing in stock futures so far. S&P and Nasdaq are flat, Dow Industrials and Russell 2000 down about 0.1% and 0.2%, respectively. Cryptos are getting beat up again, with bitcoin down almost 7%. Meme stocks not looking that great either, with AMC down another 6% in the premarket. That’s as of 0700.

This follows a day where tech stocks sold off (Nasdaq gave up 1%) and the S&P dropped 0.4%. For the most part it’s been a quiet, holiday-shortened week. Not much in the way of economic data or other events to move markets.

Today is all about non-farm payrolls, out at 0830. The May number is expected to come in at 671k, which would be a substantial increase from the 266k we saw in April. Remember that that figure was a massive surprise, as almost 1 million new jobs were expected (and some analysts, now sadly not yet discredited, were calling for twice that number).

Remember too that the market shrugged off that massive miss. As I’ve said the NFPs are just not as important as they once were. Maybe that will change today if there is another disappointing report. Of course, a disappointing number could also mean the Fed will keep its foot on the gas for longer, which markets presumably would like. So there is that. We’ll just have to see.

My thoughts on this are in the audio. Don’t feel like typing it all out.

So… quick backstory.  I got in and out of the BB craze this week super quickly. I went against my intuition and bought shares at 19 as it was ramping up, but then it fizzled and tanked. So I sold. I know I should have just held and waited out the long term play. I think it’s still a good company. This just wasn’t the one I was planning on holding.

That being said, I’m looking at Ericsson for the longer term. 6mo-1yr at least.

89,NMS," The point has gone over your head. NMS - fundamentally - was a flawed game in a way that Cyberpunk is not. While Cyberpunk could benefit from the addition of more features, all they really need to do is bug fixing - even reviews of the game seem to point this out with a lot of launch and user reviews tending around ""I like it but wish the game was less buggy"". NMS was a game flawed at its very core, even ignoring the lies about features. While the backlash was strong in part due to the lies, I think the greater reason for the backlash was that NMS just wasn't fun in any meaningful way. 

This is still a problem with NMS - even after dozens of expansions the game is still flawed to the very core and yet people hold it up as a golden sign of improvement. Considering NMS then, and the comparatively little problems needing to be fixed in Cyberpunk - it is far easier to fix bugs than to fix broken game design - I think CDProjekt are in an ok position to bounce back. If NMS can bounce back despite not fixing greater issues, CDprojekt can bounce back just as well by fixing smaller issues.

96,IRS," The IRS does have clear (and imo fair) standards on transfer pricing across jurisdictions. The regs are clear intercompany transactions need to mirror hypothetical external transactions. 

There are a couple issues that appear to be at play here, but I would be shocked if transfer pricing was one of them. If that's the case there's little to no gray area - it's just tax fraud",vhhjnkjhhhhgggghjjjk,1,/r/investing/comments/nrzssj/abbvie_and_creative_accounting/h0lj668/,0.147,0.78,0.074,-0.8038

98,AAPL," First let me say that AAPL/AMZN/GOOG are fine stocks that I wouldn't mind holding. AMZN and GOOG in particular are stocks in that rare class of never sell. The way you know is if someone said *""You can only hold 1 stock for 10(or 100) years. What stock would it be?"" The stock you pick would be in that class. My pick would be something like GOOG or AMZN.*

With that said, I don't know anything about you, your investments, and your goals/timeline. You're asking for general tips without mentioning much besides holding companies I personally wouldn't exit. So assuming I for some reason didn't want those, was looking to diversify into something like the S&P500 VOO, and wanted to minimize my tax burden then I would:

1. Buy VOO on margin first. Interest paid will offset capital gains from earnings.

2. Buy LEAPs on VOO and use money paid for call options to offset gains.

3. Sell the lowest earning shares first to minimize capital gains

4. Take a vacation and make less. That way capital gains will be lower.

5. Invest time/money into a start up or company that won't be making money and use the earnings from stocks as income. 

6. Pay taxes. You are only taxed on your earnings and every citizen should pay their fair due of taxes. Better to sell and pay taxes on earnings than not selling and making nothing. 

In 2020, I had lower earned income than normal due to the lockdowns and pandemic impact on business. So I took it as an opportunity to take some capital gains. Sold a portion of my GOOG stock I had owned since 2013 and took profits and paid low capital gains tax on it. I bought back in at a lower price because I love GOOG, but basically pocketed some of that capital gain.

101,AAPL," Maybe move some of that S&P 500 index into Whole Market index fund?  So VOO into VTI?  Still a ton of these companies but maybe 15-20% allocated into smaller companies. 

For example, VOO has 5.8% in AAPL. VTI has 4.6% (per Google).  So 1.2% reduction. 

If 85% of your money is in VOO, you would be reducing your total allocation to AAPL by about 1%.",Dowdell2008,1,/r/investing/comments/nsd6yy/overweighted_in_tech_with_tax_concerns/h0lyuf0/,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
