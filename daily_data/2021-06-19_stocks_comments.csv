1,VERY," Gold has gone down because the dollar has gone up VERY fast. Don't look just at gold, look at other commodities like copper, soy, platinum, corn they have all dropped significantly. The dollar has strengthened most likely due to the fed signaling that they might be tapering earlier than anticipated. Lots of ppl were long commodities due to fears of inflation.

16,III," The fuck it will.

First, Basel III is a banking regulation imposing capital, leverage, and liquidity requirements. Second, it was fully enforced at the beginning of 2019. 

The Basel I-III regulations were incremental increase in the robustness of world banks, motivated by the fragility that was exposed or actualized in the 2008 meltdown.

They consider physically-held gold to be a Tier 1 asset meaning it carries no discount to inclusion in regulatory holdings for risk of failure, which is not to say it carries no risk of losing value. Tier 1 also includes shares of common stock.

Banks have fiddled with gold since Bretton-Woods was eliminated in the 70s, but it's not really a big deal to them. Just another asset to convert cash into.

I keep looking for this June date in official documents but have yet to find it. If it's real it's buried, but the people who have to comply with it have been moving that way for a decade. There won't be a shift in their behavior at the end of this month.

And what “Accord”? And by that I mean when has the EU ever followed their own guidelines? 

Look at section 2 of the Maastricht Treaty, which at the time (1992) were apparently gospel “EU nations must not exceed a debt/GDP ratio of 60% at the end of fiscal years”

Meanwhile you have high level EU officials like Mario Draghi calling for outrageously elevated public debt levels to be a “normal feature” of EU member states.

Look at the numbers:

Germany: 71.2%
France: 96%
Italy: 132.7% 
Greece: 177%

30,CCL," If you can’t see anything good about their earnings report chances are that everyone else feels the same way and it’s already priced in.

This is the mistake investors often make. They see something that they think is a sure thing, forgetting that everyone else can see the same thing. Chances are good that even if CCL have a terrible earnings report they won’t go down much simply because it was expected, heck they might go up if things ain’t as bad as people think.

If you are going to gamble don’t pick one where the odds are against you. If I had to place a long or short bet on CCL (and I’m happy I don’t) I would go long on the chance they report something positive.

33,RCL," The stock market is always forward looking.  Anything you know everyone else knows and is already priced in.  When stocks move on earnings it is not because of how much money they make or they lost, it is on how different that number is from expectations.  No one is expecting Carnival to have good earnings.  If they have more good news about future bookings which have been strong for all cruise lines (I don't know specifically about Carnival) as well as good news about more ships than expected starting up the stock could actually rise.  On the other hand the only way it is going to go down is if future bookings are lower than expected and they announce further delays (which are possible as RCL just had to delay a ship due to crew covid cases).  I just don't see any large movement down but it may dip a little.  I would stay away but definitely would not be short and not heavily short into earnings.

Having said all that, full disclosure I am still long on RCL and am expecting a potential 15-25% increase in the short term.  I do like to cruise and am a member of a couple of cruising and travel related message boards and let me tell you those people are insane and have been chomping at the bit to get back to cruising.  Cruise prices have been going up and travel agents are warning people that they are going to keep going up at least through 2022 as demand is heavily outstripping supply.  That said I do not expect prices to remain so high once all the ships are back and full (as right now they are still selling assuming limited capacity).

All of your arguments are for a long term short positions not for a short position into earnings (which is more likely to be a short term positive rather than negative).  If you still believe that it is doomed then I think you should wait until after earnings and see if it jumps then go short.",imnotgood42,8,/r/stocks/comments/o3g0vb/carnival_cruises_is_reporting_its_earnings_this/h2bopy9/,0.073,0.852,0.075,-0.0387
34,CCL," I pretty much agree with the sentiments of the OP and I'm staying away.

It isn't that I don't think investing in a dip on a cruise line is a bad idea and they can't survive this, it is that the price currently is way too high to take the risk that involves. I'd take on the risk at a lower price, but enough people are willing to take the risk at a higher price.

The upside potential for the level of risk involved isn't that great. I'll invest in stocks that have less upside potential but comparatively tiny bits of risk. 

&#x200B;

However, in defense of the cruise lines, I would spot out that in normal times they are -highly- cyclical.  These are firms designed to weather storms, pun intended, but they are firms designed to make well above typical profits in good years.. They have the infrastructure in place to make a good deal of money quickly and there is a great amount of built-up demand not being met and the macro economy is well-primed for a surge in spending on excess items, like a cruise vacation.

I would expect 2 things: 1) When they are at full operations, they will be able to remake lost ground and pay off some of their debts relatively quickly and 2) getting partial operations running without having to sell as many tickets at a discount will allow them to stop the cash bleed lowering their short-term risk. It is this second part that is appealing. They could probably keep ticket prices elevated operating at 50% capacity and stop their financial bleed and maintain their high-value in assets.

&#x200B;

The political situation isn't good for them either. Even when they get back up and running, they depend on on older clients with expendable income in retirement savings, especially in off seasons (3/4 of the year). DeSantis is playing games to protect the anti-vaxers from decisions of private companies... well just for the sake of doing it.  The problem for the cruise lines is that would be a huge selling point for over 3/4 of their customer base. People knowing that everyone onboard is vaccinated would probably be a profitable selling point and they can't achieve that. Cruise lines also tend to be a bad-press magnet, because of how self-contained they are. A few covid cases on a cruise get noticed, but the tens of of thousands (or more) occurring at Wal-Mart go relatively unreported.

The reason this is important is Florida has 28 docks for cruise ships and most of them are cruise dedicated year-round and have billions in specialty infrastructure built to accommodate cruise ships. The rest of the East and Gulf Coasts only has 15 docks for cruise ships. Some of these are only seasonal and some only have minimal terminal investments. Cruises also endure larger sailing costs from non-Florida locations. The ship has to go to a foreign port due to the Jones Act. Only Florida allows a ship to burn less fuel and sail a short distance to the Bahamas, so the rest of the East/Gulf coast is more expensive to sail out of.

It has been really odd how a Republican is defiantly not helping out such a large in-state industry. He's allowed a minimal short-term political gain among a support base to outweigh being business friendly to a large in-state industry clearly in economic duress.

On the west coast, Canada not allowing sailings is a problem. The cruise lines have been granted a reprieve from the Jones Act for Alaskan cruises, but they are losing a great deal of existing terminals to access in Victoria and Vancouver.

&#x200B;

One last issue is RCCL is a better buy over CCL, but it is even more over-bought, given my perception of the risk. I think the market reflected this in their stronger price recovery. CCL was long known to buy their ships out-right and have no to low borrowing costs, but they also cut many corners and have the cheapest ships. Over the last 10 years they had too many problems pop-up that were related to the under-investment and it really hurt them. RCCL would borrow more, making them more leveraged, but their ships are in good condition and they did more to retrofit and new build in a better sales environment for on-ship purchases. They have better pay restaurants, better shops, and their cruise clients typically have more expendable income.",cwdawg15,3,/r/stocks/comments/o3g0vb/carnival_cruises_is_reporting_its_earnings_this/h2cgtui/,0.1,0.787,0.113,0.9457
