5,UK," Yeah its interesting watching it as a Canada-based Brit. 
We (in Canada) seem to have mostly tamed our inflation, if you believe the CPI numbers. Our most recent was 5.2% and core inflation plunged. Also, we are coming into the months when gas was at a peak of over $2 last year, the YoY comparison should be pretty favourable assuming it stays in the $1.4 range. 
Canada inflation never hit double figures. 
UK inflation has been over 10% a few months now. And yet their base rate is STILL lower than Canada. Its madness. However, I thik the Bank of England is stuck between a rock (inflation) and a hard place (Brexit) meaning ramping up the interest rate is likely to trigger a very hard recession.

6,UK," >Markets expect an average terminal rate of around 4.6%, while many forecasts have inflation falling to below 2% by the end of the year.

Inflation at best is flatlining at about 10%. There's no indication whatsoever that 4% base rate is having an effect on Inflation. 

These forecasters are probably the same that said inflation would be transitory at the end of 2021..

>8% would be a wild number to be at. 

Not really, historically.

Tesla LOST $9bn until 2021 when they started making money. They've been in profit 2 years yet you're acting like they're the largest car company in the world. They're not. They make a fraction of the cars on the road and their Ev share of market is dropping from 73% to 65% in the last 12 months alone. That's going to drop further in 2023 and remember: there will still be a large number of consumers who never switch to EV regardless of price or fandom.

Ford, Toyota, BMW, Merc, VW etc. Literally not a single Tesla my entire trip. 

I don’t think you understand how truly small Tesla are and how massive the majors like ford and Toyota are. Tesla I struggling to make 1.7m cars. Toyota does that in two weeks. Ford do it in a month. VW do it in a month. 

Tesla could triple their units (which will take 5 years at their current rate) and still not make the top ten regardless of whether they’re an EV company or an ICE company…while all the ice companies continue to launch more EVs.",phatelectribe,-1,/r/stocks/comments/11zk13p/fords_ev_business_lost_2_billion_in_2022_offset/jddrwwk/,0.06,0.904,0.036,-0.4003

Blue Origin, Relatively Space, SpaceX, and Rocketlab are the 4 major players right now. SpaceX is clearly number 1, Rocketlab and blue origin are both targeting different sides of space but would consider them both number 2 while relatively is 3rd.

It's much easier to just build a car from the ground up to make a good EV, rather than trying to adapt an existing ICE platform to an EV. It can still be done though.

ICE platforms are likely to run into issues due to things like the weight of the batteries if you try to build an EV based off an ICE design that wasn't designed for EV parts, which can cause other problems with the car as well.

The alternative is to spin off the EV segment into a new company, which either sinks or swims.

160,AI," Initially, I think we’ll see huge increases in white collar/office productivity as many administrative tasks become automated. I watched the demo for Microsoft’s co-pilot and I’ve been thinking about all the things I rely on people for in my job and how I will probably be able to use some version of Co-Pilot for most if not all of those tasks. So while productivity increases, many lower level administrative jobs are going to be wiped out. Will those jobs be replaced with other sectors that develop as a result of AI? I’m more optimistic than many in this point, and I think they will. 

In sciences, AI’s ability to handle the vast amount of data needed to find breakthrough drugs and cures to diseases is going to be huge. I think we’ll start seeing treatments we previously thought we impossible.

Socially and politically, I’m worried. We’ve already shown as a society what happens when social media becomes so engrained in our society—misinformation and hostility are amplified, people are more isolated despite being more connected than ever and almost nothing is truly private anymore. I think AI will add to these issues as less sophisticated bad actors gain access to highly sophisticated tools like AI that enable them to carry out bad acts.

Also the banks potentially providing the $30B in liquidity are all major banks.  It feels like it's in their best interest to let small/medium banks fail as deposits will flow into the safest (read largest) banks.  

Ergo if I were the big banks I would not provide extra liquidity. I would appease the Fed by looking into it but ultimately it feels like bad business.

But on the other hand, they’re effectively forcing Europe to also get their rates up to 5% or see their currencies collapse, just like what happened to the Euro, Pound, Swiss Franc etc last year when everything went to parity (or less) with the dollar. And seeing how system critical banks in Europe are imploding (Credit Suisse, maybe Deutsch Bank, maybe UBS too seeing how UBS’s credit default swaps are soaring the past few days), I doubt Europe has the stomach for 5% rates too? The impact on Europe of a Deutsch Bank or UBS imploding far outweighs SVB’s impact on our economy. I read somewhere that if UBS collapsed, the size of UBS relative to Swiss GDP and tax revenue means the Swiss government literally cannot afford to bail them out and make whole all depositors.",RZdidkfkfk,0,/r/stocks/comments/11zey9h/rstocks_daily_discussion_options_trading_thursday/jdcnaa6/,0.069,0.841,0.09,0.6261

My dear P/E ratio,

I'm sorry to say this, but I think we need to break up. It's not you, it's me. Well, actually, it is you.

You see, I've realized that you are not the perfect ratio that I thought you were. You have many flaws and limitations that I can no longer ignore.

You are too simplistic and naive. You only look at earnings, but you don't consider cash flow, assets, liabilities, growth potential, competitive advantage, or any other factors that affect a company's value. You are blind to the nuances and complexities of the business world.

You are too volatile and unpredictable. You change your value every time the stock price or the earnings change. You make me dizzy with your ups and downs. You are affected by market sentiment and accounting practices that can distort your true meaning.

You are too inconsistent and arbitrary. You vary widely across different sectors and industries. You have no universal standard or benchmark for comparison. You can be manipulated and misinterpreted by analysts and investors.

You are not the only ratio for me, my dear P/E ratio. There are other ratios that can offer me more insight and guidance. Ratios like P/B, P/S, EV/EBITDA, ROE, ROIC, DCF... They are all more sophisticated and comprehensive than you.

You are not my favorite ratio anymore, my darling P/E ratio. I have outgrown you and moved on to better things. I don't love you anymore.

Please don't take this personally or try to change my mind. It's over between us. I hope you find someone else who appreciates you for who you are.

Apple has been designing their own chips, unlocking some immense efficiency only available to products that control that much of the stack (both the chip design + software that runs on it). 

If they have a brain, and they have 1000s of incredible ones, they will target an in-house AI solution, just as they've done for their M1 and M2 laptops in cutting out Intel. I'm pretty sure they already have portions of the wafer designed for ML type workloads.

So when the M6 pro or w/e is out and Apple is praising the power it gives AI developers to train models on such a thin and light form factor, it will be enabled by their own chips, not nvidias. That means they capture that fat, fat margin while offering a product that can only be competed with similar, full stack designs - a very very difficult task.

Edit: on the data center GPU market, I would guess no but it really isn't impossible apple cloud becomes an AWS competitor if it runs on in house chips. I would be more confident that they do that for themselves and their products - whether they start pursuing B2B stuff with it is interesting. If the numbers balance out I can't see apple turning down a cash flow.

Edit2: I can definitely see them offering an external-GPU style solution for developers wanting more power - a nice billet aluminum box with like a KG of apple silicon that costs as much as a car.

For consumers devices, laptops and desktops sure. But barely any overlap with Nvidia as far as AI is concerned.

Production AI models are getting bigger and more complex all the time. Currently there is no indication that desktop HW might catch up with that (well ever based on the current trajectory).

For training I really don't how could Apple be competitive with cloud solution any time soon (and why'd they even want to, the market for what you described (people willing to pay much more than they could just to train their models at home with inferior hardware) is negligible small...)

Like what? The Number of Macs that had discrete GPUs back in the Intel days was negligible and that's the only product this applies too.

All buy datacenter GPUs and train their (or their client) models on them. Again is there any indication Apple is planning to enter the datacenter/enterprise market? 

I really don't see them doing that. Unless they start their AWS division or their GPUs to third parties best case they'd have to invest massive amounts of money with only payoff being some savings on their power bill (datacenter compute is a commodity)

350,AM," More on this after checking the economic calendar and seeing the 400 SPY and (~)12k nasdaq today. The macro economic events are used to justify the swings IMO. Monday is quiet as a mouse . US House price indexes on Tuesday . 

House prices going down means inflation is going down . On the other hand , a sturdy housing market is likely enough “news” to tank the other indexes. 

I am guessing it’s the latter based on my comically limited perspective as a home owner who checks Zillow and Redfin .  I still like SRS for these reasons , and then you see the 1Y and 3Y chart creeping up to highs . The ATH will never be reached again , but I can easily see a breakout to the 30’s if housing is flat and the other indexes are getting punched .

That lack of trust for videos, recordings, writings, and anything else will create a distaste for most things digital for many.
