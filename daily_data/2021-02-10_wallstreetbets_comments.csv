39,GME," It depends on the volatility of the stock. In the case of GME, when DFV pointed out the shorting interest, it was call writers (not the put buyers) and shorts in futures. At that time volatility was low. But WSB had increased volatility significantly by buying GME and these call writers and shorts in futures lost their margins (like Melvin Capital) and were forced to cover their positions aka short squeeze. And subsequently the long unwinding had also happened above 350 and now there are no many players in GME as they used to be like in January. Because many of them are stuck or booked profits and exited. So the volatility has gone down. At this juncture it is good to short OTM calls and take their premium. If the volatility, like it was in January were to return in GME you'll be victim of short squeeze like Melvin Capital. Otherwise you cash in your entire premiums. Just don't go overboard with too many margin obligations which you cannot satisfy (Remember even Melvin Capital couldn't).",CoeurDeLion-Sag,4,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lgp6c6/me_right_now/gmt586q/,0.082,0.824,0.094,0.4973

When I go all in on a stock it really fucks with me and makes my anxiety / depression go to an all time high depending on how the stock rises. Seeing -100 then +100 in a matter of seconds makes my heart race above 90 BPM until about lunchtime or I sell.  


But when I have a nice spread over a few stocks with equal-ish shares in companies I believe in I can make some good growth and if anything falls my brain automatically finds the parallel stock that is cancelling out (i.e. a Stock at +10 and a stock at -10 cancel each other out) and as much as it sucks to lose in general it doesn't make me feel nearly as bad. I can look at those mistakes as just that - a mistake.

252,CBD," We don't export buds. We export medicines derived from cannabis. Sativex for example (which is only available in Wales on the NHS and not the rest of the UK) is what we mainly export and most of it is exported to the US. It's a drug used to help muscle stiffness and spasming for people with Multiple Sclerosis. 

Sativex is not only protected by seven different patent families but its exclusivity is further enhanced by other forms of protection such as plant variety rights and proprietary know-how.

So considering we mainly export to North America, and the main drug we export is patented, and even if the drug wasn't patented, the strains used to create the drug are protected, Brexit isn't going to affect how much is exported at all.

The laws are changing, in 2018 we legalised medicinal cannabis IF there are no better non-cannabis based medicines available. Is it perfect? Far from. But changes are happening slowly. I'm a labour supporting pot head and spend about £4k a year on the stuff. We're a long way from outright legalisation, certainly do not believe it will happen in the next 10 years, but decriminalisation and furthering the scope of how we can use it medicinally is already happening.

If we were to legalise cannabis, I would fully support the legal age to be 21. There's still a lot we just don't know, but the more we understand about cannabis and mental health, the more we are understanding the detrimental effects it can have on those with predisposed mental health problems. The brain doesn't fully develop until mid/late-twenties, and studies have shown that cannabis has a negative effect on devloping brains. 

Though there are more recent studies showing that CBD was the balancing act for THC. ""Black market"" cannabis has been purposely bred to increase THC levels and reduce CBD levels. Just 20 years ago cannabis would have been about 5% THC, whereas now you can easily get your hands on cheap cannabis that's 25%+ THC (there are strains at 70%+ but that's not cheap or easy to come by, most likely not found in the UK at all). So not only have we lost the CBD levels which helped alleviate the mental side effects of THC, THC levels are increasing, just further upsetting the balance.

There are also many studies that show there are more negative side effects to long term use than positive. Lack of motivation, inability to feel emotions, anger management issues, unable to look forward or be excited by something. This can happen off just weekly use.

As someone that has been refused counselling for the amount of cannabis I smoked, I thought I'd try and give an unbiased answer to why we haven't just simply legalised the stuff. We're already in a mental health crisis across the globe with younger people, we can't afford to add more fuel to the fire. So I guess there is the argument of legalisation = regulation.

278,GME," What I’m curious about is the short interest dollar volume. Last run there was $11 billion on the line that the HFs fought over. Since there are multiple short interest figures flying around I’ll use the extremely conservative estimate of 44% of float or 22 million shares. Assuming they started shorting at $300 a pop, that comes out to roughly $6.6 billion being held by shorts. So while the short interest has fallen significantly the pie is still huge. Retails certainly do not have the organizational power or the deep pocket to kick it off. Question is will the long HFs blow up the shorts again? And if so who will fall? That said though everyone here needs to realize the mechanics has fundamentally changed with the lower short interest-higher entry point.

* They have short sold 78% of the existing stock.

* Short selling is borrowing a share and selling it at current price. You pay interest on that borrowed share. To cover your short position, you buy a share and return it to the lender.

* If the price of the stock increases, then this will cause a short squeeze.

* A short squeeze is when the lender loses confidence that the short position will be able to cover. This results in the lender calling back their share, forcing the short position to cover. When the short position covers, i.e., when they buy a share, this creates upward pressure on the stock's price. As the price goes up from the short position covering, more and more lenders will lose confidence thereby forcing more and more short positions to cover and so on.

* For GME, a short squeeze would mean that the short positions will be forced to buy 78% of all existing shares.

* They have short sold 78% of the existing stock.

* Short selling is borrowing a share and selling it at current price. You pay interest on that borrowed share. To cover your short position, you buy a share and return it to the lender.

* If the price of the stock increases, then this will cause a short squeeze.

* A short squeeze is when the lender loses confidence that the short position will be able to cover. This results in the lender calling back their share, forcing the short position to cover. When the short position covers, i.e., when they buy a share, this creates upward pressure on the stock's price. As the price goes up from the short position covering, more and more lenders will lose confidence thereby forcing more and more short positions to cover and so on.

* For GME, a short squeeze would mean that the short positions will be forced to buy 78% of all existing shares.

* The end result is that the price will explode and holders of GME stock can exit with a large profit.

333,SI,"  FINRA is the official government agency on this matter too. 30% SI is huge, 78% is astro-fucking-nomical. When 140% of the stock was shorted the shorts were betting for $20 and below. It jumped from $35-$400 in 7 days. People with $20 puts were at a 2:1 loss before they even knew what was happening; 10:1 a day after that.

Buying was shut off with most brokers because those HFs literally couldn't cover their margin calls, which made clearing houses liable; they didn't have the liquidity either; so it fell on the DTC. DTC didn't even have the liquidity, so they pawned it off as collateral on brokers and forced trading to get shut down. Everything was so underwater the entire stock market almost collapsed. Not crashed; collapsed. HF's haven't covered because they literally can't. They used money they didn't even have to open those positions in the first place (leverage), and now their brokers (institutional banks) are on the hook.

As soon as this starts going back up the rest of the lower shorts are going to get covered. Those liable were just waiting for it to bottom out. And when it really starts climbing all those people that shorted at 400 or 300 or 200 are going to start covering to lock in profits.

It is a catalyst in this sense:

* There's huge short term profit potential.
* That's exciting.
* People get excited.
* Investors pile in.
* Upward (buy) pressure.
* Price goes up leading to more excitement and buying in.

I think we all (the ones willing to wager our money) knew this is what was going to happen from the beginning and were prepared.  Even WSB being taken over/fucked with had a high probability.  The hedge funds knew war was on once DFV's power play started really taking hold and garnered a lot of attention here.  I'm sure that shit spread like Lincoln logs in a toilet bowl around the stock community and they were ready to start ushering people in to do dirty work of trying to dismantle the community.  I don't think it has worked for the  💎🙌 though.  We are suppressed but still strong and recognize the shitty actors via their bad sentiment on comments (not the usual retarded autist talk we're use to seeing) and posts like we've seen all over the place.

389,GME," Let me explain. The hedge funds involved are so powerful, they can easily overtake a Reddit community, professionally infiltrate it, bribe literally everyone, and pay for people to create anti-GME memes that would be way better than anything pro-GME posted before.

Actually, they have enough resources to buy a mercenary army, take over a third-world country in Africa, enslave everyone in that country, turn it into a human breeding farm, teach the bred children English, Finance and the arts of memes, and then send them to infiltrate this sub. And it would STILL be just a VERY SMALL fraction of what it would cost them compared to the initially planned squeeze.

Mods, admins, other active members of this sub – they're all human. Hundreds of people suddenly posting how they all were able to pay off their student debts, having sold almost exactly at peak, not $100, not $150, not $250 – also not waiting for a possible $600 out of greed –, they all seem to have some insane intuition. Truth is, those posts do discourage diamond hands A LOT, basically showing, ""that's it, we cashed in, it's over"". They are so effective, it would definitely be worth it for the hedge funds to actually pay off those people's student debts as payment for posting that one fake RH screenshot.

That's just users. But having a mod or admin here on your side to destabilize the whole GME party? This shit is easily worth 7 figures upwards. And the hedge funds have it. And it is sure as hell worth it if it means paying less than $50 per share instead of $500+.

508,GME," ETFs are absolutely a safe and reliable investments....if you get the right company managing them such as Vanguard and diversify the ETFs you buy into. Beating the market is a losers game since the house always wins, hence the bets part of the sub. Outside of a big yolo wins in here, most people lose money or grossly underperform general markets. ETFs let you buy into a ton of different stocks that are never sold and only increase in value as the corporations in them increase in value - they’re meant to be bought and held for 20+ years, a true retirement vehicle for the most part. Not at all this sub. 

I have 25% of my portfolio in ETFs, 50% in common blue chip stock, and 25% just to fuck around with like GME and now weed stonks.

So at current prices if the merger happened now your $26,500 worth of $APHA would instantly become $51,118 worth of TLRY.

So APHA is available right now at a massive discount.

In a young and VERY volatile industry like marijuana - there are a ton of awful companies.  In fact if you do any diligence and look at actual income - its so competitive that very few companies are able to turn a profit. An actively managed ETF is able to have  lot of liberty in selling off shares, weighting companies differently, and vetting new companies.

Here is some terminology for the apes out there:

Shares outstanding (total float): all shares that are held by individual investors and institutional groups, plus any restricted shares that are held by company insiders such as employees and executives. Restricted shares: shares that cannot be sold in the open market due to a restriction, like a time lock or employee compensation. Public (free) float: A company's ""float"" are the shares are available for trading on any given day — in other words, shares outstanding minus any restricted shares.

The Numbers:

Gamestop is shorted at 78% of the total float (shares outstanding) according to finra's new report today. There are exactly 69.75 million shares outstanding for gamestop. This means that 78% of 69.75 million shares are shorted, or ((69,750,000 / 100) * 78) = 54,405,000 shares short. Total free float varies between 49 million shares to 51 million shares according to yahoo finance and finvis, so lets assume this number is 50 million shares. The short of free float ratio is now 54,405,000 / 50,000,000 = 108% of free float.

Now this is where the numbers get really fucking interesting:

According to finra institutions own approximately 144 million shares (obviously this number is out of date, and cannot be factored in). According to yahoo finance, institutions own 122% of the free float (some institutions sold), which equates to ((50,000,000 / 100) * 122) = 61,000,000 shares. According to finviz, institutions own approximately 95% of the free float (some institutions sold), which equates to ((50,000,000 / 100) * 95) = 47,500,000 shares.

Lets assume the worst case scenario, where institutions only own 47,500,000 shares of the free float. This leaves 50,000,000 - 47,500,000 = 2,500,000 shares available to us WSB apes.

The best case scenario is that shorts must must buy back 54,405,000 shares from 2,500,000 shares from us, assuming institutions never sell from this point onward (this is not realistic at all, and will lead to the biggest MOASS)

The worse case scenario is that shorts must buy back and institutions sell like they did this time around. However, there is a caveat: why would institutions sell their stock when it is at 50 dollars? They are literally incentivized to jack the price up before they sell the stock for short sellers to buy back.

This leads to the average case scenario: stock shoots back up, and gamma squeeze will fuck these shorts up. Keep in mind that shorters are attempting to hedge their shorts with 800 dollar call options. If trading desks dont halt the stock, you can see some insane price action beyond 800 dollars. If they halt the stock, you can expect a similar outcome to what we've witnessed already.

EDIT: revised based on feedback. Thank you those who corrected me.

EDIT2: 

Guys, stop saying that 78% is of the free float. The 78% is on the shares outstanding (also known as total float). Im recalculating the numbers with the below definition

Definition: 
When expressed as a percentage, short interest is the number of shorted shares divided by the number of shares outstanding. For example, a stock with 1.5 million shares sold short and 10 million shares outstanding has a short interest of 15% (1.5 million/10 million = 15%).

.78 = X/69,750,000, where x is the total number of shorted shares. 

X = 54,405,000 shares shorted. 

54,405,000 / 50,000,000 = 108% of free float is shorted.

Yes, math checks out.

EDIT3: 

https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnys/gme/quote

Click the short interest, and its calculated with 78% based on the free float (21 million short / 27 million free float) = 78% short of free float. I AM MOST LIKELY WRONG WITH MY ORIGINAL POST ABOVE THESE EDITS.

Keep in mind that prices were at 325 dollars a share when this was reported, so idk what to think about these numbers honestly.

576,GME," So lemme get this straight. Based on a report on 2 week old data, that is calculated three different ways by varying sources, the short interest was anywhere from 42-78%? And that was right before the RH nonsense and Wallstreet changed the rules? So we don't currently know for sure what the actual SI is but we think its more than that? 

Here's what I think could happen, and stick with me for this. If the GME sentiment carries, and this fucked up autistic collection of apes keeps slowly buying the float and not selling, it will truly result in a VW style MOASS. As the percentage of float goes down because idiots like me keep buying a couple shares every paycheck the float will dry up, just like what Porsche did to setup the VW MOASS. So, it doesn't really matter the accuracy of the SI because either way the estimated float % will slowly dwindle off and any and all shares sold short will eventually get trapped when the volume starts to slowly dwindle off and the price starts to creep up. 💎🙌 is the real key with this assumption as the total amount taken off the table will need to be massive, we are talking $100+ million to make it happen. 

Why I think the previous squeeze was delayed/avoided/cheated? Well first of all Wallstreet changed the rules, maybe because legitimate reasons, most likely because they could and they are sore losers. Either way artificially limiting demand was a dirty trick. Secondly, that squeeze was being set off by big money, other wallstreet players that wanted to take a chunk out of their competition. They probably helped bail the losing funds out in exchange for some other favorable deals and some other trades we know nothing about. Did it all under the guise of a social phenomenon and then tried to use that to hit all their positions and win bigly. I know I would. I mean, if you watched CNBC talk about it at all, they threw every single ticker symbol that went up over 20% onto the ""ReDdiT iS TarGEtINg ThE ShORtz"" segments. Even shit I never saw on here. And I know there are whales in here that toss money into absolutely dog shit yolos, but that was tens if not hundreds of billions of dollars moving around every corner of the stock market, and a reddit movement doesn't have that kinda cash.

Why do I think the second one will be different? If the float % captured by WSB gets ridiculous, I'm talking upwards of 25 million shares and roughly 1/3 of the company, there won't be shares to bail these funds or other retail shorts out with. They won't be able to go to other players and offer anything cause they won't be able to get the shares from them. This could go totally nuclear, but only if this whole buy and hold bagholding keeps going, and I mean for awhile. The last estimate of WSB ownership of GME was like what 3-5% so we would need to increase that by roughly 10x and that was during the squeeze, I know a lot of people probably sold off by now so its an even longer shot. Still, I think it might happen. And if a good catalyst comes along like an awesome earnings or news from RC it could also drive the momentum for this.

596,GME," I understand there must be some more complex calculation for a stock price, but I am trying to simplify it for my Ape brain.

So the price of GME shares was pulled down because of these ""synthetic"" longs since the company value (let's say $100) was not changed, but the number of the shares (let's say a total of 100 shares available) is increased and by the synthetics (122 shares) the value of a share was dropped. Simply, the current value is $0.82 ($100/122) instead of $1 ($100/100).Maybe the spike we had in the last week of Jan was just because the demand was extreme.

If my understanding is slightly true, the squeeze is on hold right now, or we might have a Squeeze 2.0.

734,GME," I read all of it. Thank you for putting it together.
My non technical thoughts are that the squeeze would indeed have been a catostrophe, as you said. It would have led to a domino of liquidations, from the shorts to their backers then the banks and so on. A true transfer of wealth.
When GME rose, many stocks and the SPY plummeted. Then they halted buying as there were likely few shares left and the losses would have been infinite.
Suspicions were corroborated by interactive broker's head saying on cnbc that GME is a $17 stock and they stopped trading to ensure there was no collapse.
I also think that maybe the ones with real money on the bull side don't want a giant squeeze as they are likely to have many positions, which could drop hard if GME squeezes. So, they may be ok with squeezing this, getting profits, then letting the shorts attack it. Kind of like a sinusoidal wave pattern.

Remember, the MSM is the same damn fraternity as these suits, always has been.

DTCC needs to be investigated on this. More so than the HFs who shorted GME to the ground, as they facilitated (and likely continue to) the naked shorting.

After years of trying, WSB finally found the one perfect bet with GME. u/DeepFuckingValue was a statistical inevitability: a WSB member who actually found the perfect setup, even as everyone else was posting their loss porn from yet another failed attempt.

What happened with GME was solid proof that if you put a million apes in front of keyboards, eventually one of them will produce something brilliant.

Even if there were no DFV or GME, eventually another brilliant opportunity would've been discovered. There'd be the same influx of newbies, the same (or similar) media frenzy, the same shitshow with the sub getting hijacked.

>What the fuck happened?

On the 25th of January there was 2.5 million people. 16 days later there are 8.8 million and a (basically) new mod team.

6.3 million people joined because of GME FOMO. And now are bag holder refusing to believe they are bag holders. The original 2.5mil got in and got out in the green. Wednesday the 27th of January there were sell orders triggered for one Redditor (cant find his username, but go looking, youll find it in one of the threads on the 27th or 28th) for $2,500 per share. This place has never been about diamond hands, or about a cause, or fucking over the hedge funds. It has always been about making quick money on ridiculous bets!

BUT THE SQUEEZE HASNT BEEN SQUOZE 

There is an additional 6.6 million people here. Legit smooth brains. Most of these are encouraging people to hold GME and buy GME WHILE NOT SHOWING ANY POSITIONS. Have a look at the post history of ANYONE on the front page. 80% of people havn't posted to WSB before GME. Also, the mods won't allow posts criticizing GME bag holders....

>I joined WSB 3 weeks ago to become part of a movement that stood as a symbol of small investors' resistance to the foul play of the big players, the eilte and the WS. Everyone here was touting buying and holding GME at the time. They wanted to set an example and make money at the same time. There was talk of a redistribution of wealth from the super-rich to the poor. DO YOU ACTUALLY REALIZE HOW HISTORIC THIS MOVEMENT COULD HAVE BECOME??? And now, although nobody really knows exactly what kind of evil game was played with us back then, many throw away this idea and just go their way. I mean, I didn't know WSB before and I don't know anyone here personally. But now I just have to tell you: I have never seen such a pathetic bunch of hypocritical, lying, weak, small-minded and cowardly people anywhere in my life as here at WSB.
I'm out of here once and for all you morons. I can't stand this forum here anymore. This place is pathetic ad nauseum. And NEVER AGAIN PREFACE AS IF YOU WANT TO MAKE EVEN ONE PIECE OF THIS SICK WORLD BETTER.

I told people $48 would make a great entry, several times over the course of the last few days.

I didn't even take the chance that it would actually come down that far.  I bought a bunch (back) at $58, sold calls that expired last Friday, sold more calls that expire tomorrow... brings my basis down to between $37 and $38.

Without any changes whatsoever, I think it's worth $32 right now.

I think it's worth $65 with Cohen involvement, *very conservatively*.

Here's the big thing: this is, *still*, viewed by Wall St. as a dead company with crap financials, two years from bankruptcy.  That's just never going to happen.  At some point, these idiot analysts will get around to updating their financial models.  And then, at some point, Cohen and company with start to release some press about future directions they plan to take this boat.  Once that happens, Wall St. is going to turn this into a darling stock, and start slapping huge upside PTs on it and bullish calls.  First, $80, then $120, then $145, etc.

Video Games and game loot are a completely different rodeo. It seems like long-term, games are going away for them as a revenue source. They have turned it around some with loot/merch, though. Hopefully that will continue but it doesn't have the obvious, not going away need that pet food has. 

I've got my GME and I'm holding. I hope Cohen can turn things around, I think there's a good chance he can.

978,GME," Short Squeezes, Shorts and $GME.

Current Position: 33 $GME Shares @ $103.88

Amateur Investors vs Hedge Funds is a topic that has been circulating this subreddit for the last month (or so). Especially when it comes to the Shorts placed on GME by Melvin Capital and the confusion as to how come a short squeeze hasn’t happened yet. I’m gonna assume that if you’re reading this, that you already know a bit about Shorts, and short squeezes and how the Hedge funds would have to buy back there shares they shorted and all that.

For the last several weeks we have seen Short Ladder Attacks, Brokerages (RH) restricting the purchasing of stock and many other tactics all to try and lower the price of GME as much as possible.

The question I think we have all been asking ourselves is at what point will they start covering their shorts?

Well, while I have no idea when they will start covering there shorts, I did want to do some research to try and figure out at what price Melvin Capital shorted GME for, so using the public SEC Database, I was able to find some information.

Now firstly I want to say that, I am not a financial advisor, investment advisor or any kind of advisor at all, I am just a amateur investor who has been following this GME thing since it started. So, I may be mistaken on points, or just wrong. I am just here to present the information I have found and the thoughts I have in hopes that others on here will be able to contribute there ideas/research.

The Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) database of Form 13F for Melvin Capital:

https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?owner=exclude&action=getcompany&type=13F-HR&CIK=1628110

If you look at the most recent file, it says it was filed on 2020-11-16. So, November 16 2020 is the most recent file that's available. Yet, the OMB (Office of Management and Budget) approval stamp says it expires on October 31st, 2018. (There’s probably a reasonable explanation for this, but I thought it was worth mentioning.) 🚀🚀🚀

Anyway, in the most recent file, it states that Melvin Capital is shorting 5,400,000 shares of GME for a value of $55,080,000. If we do some basic math, that means they shorted GME for $10.20 a share.  (I think that's what that means so please let me know)

Now, I could go through all of them, but I am way too lazy for that, but if these forms mean what I potentially believe (and who knows I may be wrong) that as long as the GME share price stays above $10 (or so) a share, then wouldn’t Melvin Capital have to buy back there shares at that price?

So in this retards opinion, I don’t believe Melvin Capital genuinely has any sort of possibility of getting the share price to less than $10 a share (when writing this, GME is currently at around $50 a share) These Short Ladder Attacks and other tactics to lower the price are (in my opinion) not to try and return the price to sub $10, but instead to lower it as low as possible so its the least damaging to there wallets when they have to cover the shorts.

I’m really wondering whether or not I’m right on this, so please let me know if I’m mistaken on anything or if there’s any information I should look at, I would really appreciate it. 🙌🏻💎🙌🏻💎🙌🏻💎🙌🏻💎",meekie18,4,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lgpwez/why_this_is_just_a_beginning_a_guide_for_the_gme/gmullo3/,0.042,0.857,0.101,0.9908

Ask price for 950c is 5.00, ask for 500-850 is 10.00. So watch these bids and asks. The bid for 780 is $0.05 so there might be something to gain.

Btw the 'fair' price for these options considering standard models (BSM) is $2.5-$3. If you're putting limit orders in I'd set them around that mark and see if you can maybe get twice as many contracts.

Here is some terminology for the apes out there:

Shares outstanding (total float): all shares that are held by individual investors and institutional groups, plus any restricted shares that are held by company insiders such as employees and executives. Restricted shares: shares that cannot be sold in the open market due to a restriction, like a time lock or employee compensation. Public (free) float: A company's ""float"" are the shares are available for trading on any given day — in other words, shares outstanding minus any restricted shares.

The Numbers:

Gamestop is shorted at 78% of the total float (shares outstanding) according to finra's new report today. There are exactly 69.75 million shares outstanding for gamestop. This means that 78% of 69.75 million shares are shorted, or ((69,750,000 / 100) * 78) = 54,405,000 shares short. Total free float varies between 49 million shares to 51 million shares according to yahoo finance and finvis, so lets assume this number is 50 million shares. The short of free float ratio is now 54,405,000 / 50,000,000 = 108% of free float.

Now this is where the numbers get really fucking interesting:

According to finra institutions own approximately 144 million shares (obviously this number is out of date, and cannot be factored in). According to yahoo finance, institutions own 122% of the free float (some institutions sold), which equates to ((50,000,000 / 100) * 122) = 61,000,000 shares. According to finviz, institutions own approximately 95% of the free float (some institutions sold), which equates to ((50,000,000 / 100) * 95) = 47,500,000 shares.

Lets assume the worst case scenario, where institutions only own 47,500,000 shares of the free float. This leaves 50,000,000 - 47,500,000 = 2,500,000 shares available to us WSB apes.

The best case scenario is that shorts must must buy back 54,405,000 shares from 2,500,000 shares from us, assuming institutions never sell from this point onward (this is not realistic at all, and will lead to the biggest MOASS)

The worse case scenario is that shorts must buy back and institutions sell like they did this time around. However, there is a caveat: why would institutions sell their stock when it is at 50 dollars? They are literally incentivized to jack the price up before they sell the stock for short sellers to buy back.

This leads to the average case scenario: stock shoots back up, and gamma squeeze will fuck these shorts up. Keep in mind that shorters are attempting to hedge their shorts with 800 dollar call options. If trading desks dont halt the stock, you can see some insane price action beyond 800 dollars. If they halt the stock, you can expect a similar outcome to what we've witnessed already.

EDIT: revised based on feedback. Thank you those who corrected me.

EDIT2:

Guys, stop saying that 78% is of the free float. The 78% is on the shares outstanding (also known as total float). Im recalculating the numbers with the below definition

Definition: When expressed as a percentage, short interest is the number of shorted shares divided by the number of shares outstanding. For example, a stock with 1.5 million shares sold short and 10 million shares outstanding has a short interest of 15% (1.5 million/10 million = 15%).

.78 = X/69,750,000, where x is the total number of shorted shares.

X = 54,405,000 shares shorted.

54,405,000 / 50,000,000 = 108% of free float is shorted.

Yes, math checks out.

EDIT3:

https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnys/gme/quote

Click the short interest, and its calculated with 78% based on the free float (21 million short / 27 million free float) = 78% short of free float. I AM MOST LIKELY WRONG WITH MY ORIGINAL POST ABOVE THESE EDITS.

The Daily Short Sale Volume Files provide aggregated volume by security for all short sale trades executed and reported to a TRF, the ADF, or the ORF during normal market hours for public dissemination purposes (i.e., media-reported trades). There are individual files for the volume associated with trades reported to each TRF (FINRA/Nasdaq Chicago, FINRA/Nasdaq Carteret, FINRA/NYSE), the ADF, and the ORF. There is also a file entitled ""Consolidated TRF/ADF Daily Short Sale Volume Files,"" which combines the volume for trades in exchange-listed securities reported to the TRFs and the ADF.

FINRA posts the Daily Short Sale Volume Files to this no later than 6:00:00pm ET of the same day on the relevant trade date.

Trading volume is fucking 550m that week, enough for anybody to cover. If a share can be sold short multiple times it can be bought back and cover multiple times. Institutions have high frequency trading algos that can do things faster than you can imagine, they don't really need your shares.

1145,AMC," I signed up for A-list a few days ago and took my girlfriend to see a movie at my AMC.

My initial purchase was 1200 shares @ $12.99, bought $5k more at around $7, bringing my average to $10.91.  I'll be happy to break even at this point, but setting my sell limit every day at $15 so I don't miss out on too much upside if it booms.  I figure if it does reach 10-12 bucks randomly, it's not just going to drop back to $5 instantly... I hope.

&#x200B;

I'll be holding until I break even or make a profit... don't care how long it takes at this point.

&#x200B;

I started investing about 10 months ago, and this is currently the most expensive lesson I learned.  From now on, I will always make sure I have a stop loss order on all stocks... For example, after I bought AMC at 12.99, it went up to $17 that day.  I should have set a stop loss at $15.   Basically, I am betting 2k that the price will go up still.   Short gains add up.

I also missed out on huge gains this year because of paper hands.

They've got a new moral conviction that holding is going to win the battle of good vs evil and simultaneously make them rich.

On top of that, with the well known prevalence of disinformation in social media, it's very easy for them to perform mental gymnastics dismissing any evidence that does not agree with their collective narrative.

This is literally the same mechanism that qanon used, and maga.

I'm not saying GME is going to tank, but I don't have my hopes up either.  And I sure as hell am not going to allow myself to be brainwashed by a GME cult.

IF. IF. IF. If you retards would stop being so self absorbed and in denial about GME and instead learn about the economics the fundamentals the financial institutions instruments etc of how this shit works you could have your actual ""revolution"" your actual elevation of millions of people accessing ""rapid"" (but uneven) financial growth. 

Instead you just chant memes and pretend you're part of a cause by posting crap about HODL or whatever. You want to be long on GME? Hope the price falls to 20 or lower before earnings and YOLO that shit. (I will) But stop using blatant denialism to ruin a sub and financially ruin yourselves because you're literally just giving money to the hedgefunds that you claim to hate. If you care about poor people getting rich it doesnt require them beating ""the rich"" Melvin shitron shitadel, they're all just a massive drop in the bucket and killing them is just for your young egos it's not even a single bloodstain on the tapestry of wealth inequality or whatever shit you're worried about. Poor people getting rich ISNT reliant on rich people getting poor. Figure that out and you might actually go learn something and start making money.

1244,GME," ? People have been promoting weed stocks while GME was at its peak, they literally were trying to make bank on gamestonks and use that to buy dankstonks.  I’ve seen at least 4-5 posts this week pushing weed.  The fact that democrats control congress is also enough of a reason to go weed stocks by itself.  If you read through the posts instead of just ignoring all of them because you think they’re all GameStop related that’s on you.

Edit: just to exemplify how pointless this complaint is, here is the post I saw directly below this post explaining how tlry was the second most discussed stock yesterday.

At present time the floor for GME is $40+. Therefore, apes should not care about volatility or share value in the face of downward pressure. Hedge funds want to cover at sub-$10 or sub-$5 but that will not happen thanks to diamond hands. HF want your shares but $40+ is still too damn expensive so they will continue to apply downward pressure and send wave after wave of bots, shills, and concern trolls to break pro-GME sentiment. It costs us nothing to hold. It costs HF real money every single day as they are forced to pay interest on borrowed shares. HF will eventually capitulate because even though they have a lot of money, they don't have infinite money. We can stay retarded longer than hedge funds can stay solvent.

- killed all the GME media hype

- tried to move focus to other stocks

The math never added up, the volume was super low for the large price movements, and if they covered big we would have seen more upward movement.

It costs us *nothing* to hold. It costs HF real money every single day as they are forced to pay interest on borrowed shares. HF will eventually capitulate because even though they have a lot of money, they don't have infinite money. *We can stay retarded longer than hedge funds can stay solvent.* Patience will win the day, my fellow apes.",adle1984,105,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lgrxxk/gme_reeee_consolidation_zone_210/gmup1ey/,0.141,0.717,0.142,-0.1835

1500,SI," First short interest is the number of shorts divided by the outstanding shares.

So simple algebra says 0.7846 = X / 69.75m shares

Short Shares X = 54.72M Shares

Float = 46.89M Shares

What does this tell you? Still a lot of synthetic shorts out there about 7M shares.

Short Interest Ratio is the number of days to cover those shares = shorts / average daily volume

SIR = 54.72M / 50.62M (Average for 10 days) SIR = 1.08

Meaning it will take a little over a day for the shorts to cover.

What does it mean?

As others have said HOLD. By holding and not selling you drop the denominator in the equation and thereby increase the SIR so it takes the shorts longer to cover their position.

Regarding SI being 228% there were

2.28 = X / 69.75M

X = 159M shorted shares.

So prior to the recent craziness the average daily volume for 30 days was 32.17M per day. So 159m / 32.17M

SIR = 4.9 which means it would have taken the shorts close to 5 days just to cover.

So to get SIR as high as possible you either increase the numerator (or have more shorts) or decreased he denominator by HOLDING and not selling.

 Robinhood, Melvin Capital, Citadel execs expected to testify in Congress on GameStop turmoil - sources REUTERS 9:07 AM ET 2/10/2021 GME 53.6 up +3.29 (+6.5395%) QUOTES AS OF 10:09:32 AM ET 02/10/2021  
WASHINGTON, Feb 10 (Reuters) - Executives from Robinhood, Melvin Capital and Citadel Securities are expected to testify before a House panel at a Feb. 18 hearing exploring recent trading turmoil in GameStop Corp.(GME) and related stocks, according to two sources familiar with the matter. The three companies will face questions from the House Financial Services Committee, which is examining how an apparent flood of retail trading drove certain stocks to extreme highs, squeezing hedge funds like Melvin that had bet against those shares. A committee spokesman did not respond to a request for comment. (Reporting by Svea Herbst-Bayliss and Pete Schroeder Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)

Also it’s different when the witch hunt is on the people who think GME is done, not the other way around. In fact, a good portion of the active users from this sub left and made a new one because it was so bad here.

If you think 7 million new people are the victim, take a hard look at the probability of that. Herd mentality at its finest. Yeah WSB loves losses but we don’t encourage it in a mass exodus unironic way, spreading false hope, and the same lies over and over and over again.

Also these people are tired of seeing the same post each week. “The float interest is 140%! Hold on to your crayon hands it’s gonna hit this Friday!” Then Friday rolls around “The float interest is 120%! Hold on to your wife’s boyfriend, it’s gonna go up on Tuesday when the SEC releases a report!” Tuesday rolls around. “Omg the short interest is 74%! The squeeze has not squoze!”

All the while the stock continues to plummet. Any sensible person with a calculator, internet connection, and crayon sees the writing on the wall. Simple math.

But whatever, this will be my last take on GME for a few days. I’m just gonna sit back relax, and watch how it all plays out.

On ~$1B of revenue in 2020 it would compound at 15%pa to ~$4B.

$4B of a $750B market is shit.

Good points on profit margin, if they keep that up in the next few years, maybe a higher valuation. But as competitors enter the market, margins go down. keep an eye on that

Leader in proprietary systems? Thats a big tick too

But arent we missing the whole BB track record? BB is a fucking flop and dinosaur in the mobile phone market. They couldnt move with the times, stopped innovating. Thats their track record. With this new market/venture, their track record shows that they don't have good management and dont have good long term decision making processes. They may be first to lead the market, but will fall behind whenever the next big leap happens ( as it did with smart phones)

TLDR: Hard to put a value on BB but I think you could be there, if BB gets to an EPS $10 and shows they can maintain dominance, $45 is viable.

1855,DD," Trend in growth/sales/expenses.

The effects on the stock by market volatility, can the stock take possible downturns and if so how fast can it recover?

The trends of competitors and emergent competitors. (When I say trends I mean actual figures such as market research/search results in particular regions if applicable/Figures from their earnings calls and quarterly reports)

The goals of the stock in question vs their competition and your opinion on which is more relevant to the direction of the market. (I.e. If a company is focusing on pushing hard sales in an economic downturn with people spending less they are less favorable to the company that is conserving profits and taking a good approach to their expenditure during such a time)

A clear exit strategy is also very important if not passive investing, and that does not mean pick a number that seems high and ""aim"" for the price. If a company is up and coming and you think they will be the market leaders don't expect them to exceed the current market lead market cap without excessive risk.

If you are interested in some decent DD I can link you in the right way assuming you don't just jump in blind.

Nyan cat, rick roll, chocolate rain. Don't invest in memes unless you know how to get out before they become stupid.
2. The SEC needs to assess how (if at all) the mods push or block threads on here. The current GME pumping is ridiculous. IT'S OVER AND YOU'RE A FUCKING MORON IF YOU DON'T SEE THAT. Why are such threads still being pumped and what role, if any do mods or purchased upvotes have to do with it? (You didn't know you can buy upvotes? google it. very easy.) **It would be hilarious if hedge funds are buying upvotes to con suckers into buying GME so they can take your money by shorting once it spikes.**
3. Deepfuckignvalue told you all when to sell, it was the day he converted his gains to millions in cash. I have no doubt he would be going to jail right now for a pump and dump if not for the fact that he publicly revealed that sale. The fact that he publicly revealed it and you all still believed his GME pump is on you.

1988,GME," Alternative perspective:

The point of this place is to make money, the people who sold at the top didn't ""get nervous"" or doing anything wrong, they were smarter than you and took  your money.  That's the point.  You have no friends day trading, and if you take only one lesson away from this, let it be that.

>This isn't about money anymore

It is about money.  It's always about money.  It really can't be about anything other than money.  The difference is not between ""paperhands nervous loser vs diamond hands apes"", it's between people who spotted the top and got out with the money and people who stayed in and gave it to them.  You didn't get fucked by wallstreet, at least not entirely - you also got fucked by the people in here who are smarter than you. 

It's also not about ""making wallstreet bleed"" or sending a message, get that stupid ideology bullshit out of here.  GME is owned by the biggest nastiest institutions on wallstreet.  Melvin capital isn't ""wall street"".  Blackrock is ""wall street"".  Guess who owns a shitload of GME?  You donated money you need for rent to larry fink's hookers n blow fund and you think you're sticking it to the man?  

They also didn't ""fuck you by changing the rules"".  The rules always existed, prominent amongst them liquidity requirements for brokerages and clearing houses.  You chose to use a brokerage for children because it had a pretty app, as did all the others like you, and because of that choice when Baby's First Brokerage couldn't keep up with the volume your momentum was killed.  Stop looking for conspiracies and start learning how and why you fucked up.

2490,APHA," The reason I never exercise is it makes no sense to do it before expiration since you lose any extrinsic value, and I'd rather control my exit at a comfortable price instead of leaving it to chance on expiration where price manipulation can cause fluctuations and stress I avoid.  Also, my broker charges a lot to exercise and I have to pre-arrange it, hope that the direction doesn't get screwed up on and they accidentally sell to close my position, or worse, let them expire in the money (which I've seen happen!).  Lastly, and to expand my point about controlling the prices, I can sell to close at my price (on a climb of the underlying) and then subsequently time my entry into the underlying by getting into a dip, or likely multiple dips over several days.  Especially at the values you are looking to exercise.  I also try to avoid letting delta go above say 0.8, I'll typically roll it out at either a further date, higher price, or both, obviously depending on my sentiment of the trade.

2500,CAN," If they exercise the option, they are now obligated to buy the underlying shares (100 per contract.) So yes, a lot more money. So if the contract cost 1200, and the SHARE price was 100, and the contract strike price is 100.(100 x 100 = 10000) they are now have a contract that cost 1200, but covers 10000.00 worth of shares. So let's say the share increases to 120 the day the contract expires. The contract now controls 100 x 120 = 12000 value of shares. The profit = 12000 - 10000 = 2000, minus the cost of the contract 2000 - 1200 = 800.

Now they have two options. Sell to close or exercise the contract. To exercise, you need to buy the shares for the underlying costs. You CAN use your profits, but still need a lot more capitol. Most would sell to close the contract, thus profiting 800.

Okay, so now we see the value of these contracts. You get to bet on 10k worth of shares for a fraction of their cost. Now, if the stock doesn't go up,  or goes down, the contract decreases in value the closer you get to the expiration. That leaves one w a hard decision. Do you sell at a loss, or hold on?

2536,GME," The option that friend B bought is very deep in the money. The premium that they did pay would have been absurdly high if they bought when GME was over $100 (the contract would be over 100% in the money). Deep ITM contracts run the risk of “slippage” as the price continues to grow because there’s 

A. Less people that can afford them (remember there’s always someone on the other end)
B. The spreads for the contract change and can be very wild and impossible to predict as the price moves. 

All depends on who owns them and what they decide the ask price should be. There are days that the price can rise, and deep ITM contracts can decrease. The unpredictability and expense is a risk that most people don’t want to take.",papyrus33,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lgh95u/palantir/gmrzonx/,0.041,0.925,0.035,0.0422

2538,NIO," For the seller there are two types.  A naked call which means they don't already own 100 shared of the underlying stock.  Or a covered call which is someone who does own the stock and sold a call against it.  

A naked call has unlimited downside, if the stock moons you owe to buy 100 shares of that stock on the expiration date.  If the stock goes down though, you keep all the premium without having to own the stock.

A covered call has a few pitfalls.  Personal experience, I had NIO selling covered calls against it.  I was collecting 10% every 2 weeks while the stock was flat to slightly up.  Then it mooned out of nowhere and all my calls I sold means all my stock sold.  Now I made good money on it, I made the stock value up to the strike and made the premium on top of that.  But ... If I didn't sell calls against that I would have doubled my money so I missed out on the moon.  The other extreme is possible too.  The price of the stock can plummet but you can't sell because the option price doesn't exactly follow the option price.  The stock can go way down but the option may not move too much.  Covered calls work best on steady increasing stocks and not holding all the way to expiration.",TerrorSuspect,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lgh95u/palantir/gms5udo/,0.021,0.917,0.062,0.8579

2594,APHA," APHA is currently 27.7 aftermarket and TLRY is @48.6, this is ~0.57 ratio, way worse than 0.83. So indeed we will have the arbitrage. However, keep in mind that option IV for both tickets is  already exploding @ 200%, so buying naked calls will be risky right now because of potential IV crush.

Also, keep in mind that both stocks can fall to satisfy the conversion ratio.

That said, there is a way to play the arbitrage: long APHA and short TLRY, at the ratio of 1/0.83 ~= 5/4. Since, borrow cost of TLRY is expensive, it might be more economical to construct synthetic short positions (sell call buy put). This way you are not betting upside/downside of the stocks, but trying to gain from the price imbalances.

Shorting is risky so I would put a long call further otm to avoid margin issues.

This is is no financial advice and just my dd.

Edit:

The current pricing of APHA vs TLRY indicates there is a risk that the deal will not sweeten. Ask your self: if anyone can get arbitrage, it may not be an arbitrage. So take your bet ;)

Just checked: TLRY is almost impossible to short now, even with options. So yup, no free lunch and take your bet!

2624,APHA," >  (2) the split/ratio is adapted to Aphria's detriment, both seem highly unlikely because the merger was already publicly announced. 

This is the crux of the argument right here. Let's dig into it:

1) Why is that unlikely? If an asset was mispriced what is to stop a correction from happening prior to the merger actually going through?

2) What difference does it make that it was publicly announced? They can just update the ratio and....publicly announce it again.

If these part of the thesis doesn't hold true, and for some regulatory or contractual reason beyond ""I dunno they prolly just won't do it,"" then the entire thesis falls apart.

1. Memes are fleeting. Go through the history of memes and you'll see that every single one took over the world for a brief period of time, where everyone thought it was genius, and a short while later -- it was stupid and irrelevant. Nyan cat, rick roll, chocolate rain. Don't invest in memes unless you know how to get out before they become stupid.
2. The SEC needs to assess how (if at all) the mods push or block threads on here. The current GME pumping is ridiculous. IT'S OVER AND YOU'RE A FUCKING MORON IF YOU DON'T SEE THAT. Why are such threads still being pumped and what role, if any do mods or purchased upvotes have to do with it? (You didn't know you can buy upvotes? google it. very easy.) **It would be hilarious if hedge funds are buying upvotes to con suckers into buying GME so they can take your money by shorting once it spikes.**
3. Deepfuckignvalue told you all when to sell, it was the day he converted his gains to millions in cash. I have no doubt he would be going to jail right now for a pump and dump if not for the fact that he publicly revealed that sale. The fact that he publicly revealed it and you all still believed his GME pump is on you.
4. Your analysis of ""short ladders"" 201 rule blah blah is just wrong. This is another thing the SEC shoudl investigate. Are you posting this BS because you're new and just don't know or are you intentionally spreading bs?
5. Value people you know in real life over random internet people. Let's be honest, the main reason people post on reddit is because they have some socially undesirable trait that they want to hide. Otherwise they'd be in real life, facebook groups and so on. This can be that they are ugly, an undesirable minority, anything. But they do it to hide that from others, while also engaging in the human necessity of socializing. Another reason is that they are scamming and don't want that scam tied to their identity. I read reddit too but I know to value the people I actually know in real life over anonymous randos.",DannetteFlatt,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lh0bpl/_/gmv5fex/,0.087,0.872,0.042,-0.9164

They've got the contract to replace the Humvee in 2015 and celebrated rolling out their 10,000th JLTV today. Though based on some articles they're still not quite as combat ready as the Humvee.

The only rebuttal I have is that none of this is contingent on Joe Biden. USPS has been looking to replace their fleet and hoping to go electric since 2016 when they proposed the contract for bids. The rewarding of the contract was delayed twice last year and the buzz was looking toward WKHS then too. Either way, we already knew it was most likely going to be electric. Oshkosh teamed up with Ford to design something. WKHS made an actual product (with design input from UPS) and they're nearing 10k orders already. So they have the infrastructure to build a large number of vehicles and in fact have two models to pick from. WKHS also has the benefit of not being tied to a big manufacturer like Ford who will increase overhead and the likelihood of the project needing an extension (just like Oshkosh needed a $25mil extension for the JLTV last year). WKHS is ready to go and they've proven that. But others are ready to go as well. But as far as buying puts? I wouldn't. They're still getting orders and being long on them might be better than a single payout from a government contract that'll tie up their resources for the next 5 years.

Definitely an interesting play on your part and might turn out to be a smart one. No one inside WKHS has been bullish on their own company since 2019. They've sold shares as recently as last month.

Edit: Additional research shows that Oshkosh has some lobbying on record with the USPS in 2019 and 2020 while Workhorse has done none.",Birdhawk,44,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lgebby/yesterday_if_you_followed_my_advice_on_tlry_youd/gmr2b8a/,0.015,0.821,0.163,0.9935

3006,AMD," Yeah I’m also in AMD they have a great product. Market beating and given nVidia issues with 30xx chip quantity and intel being unable to make decent cpu after years of hegemony in the market AMD is amazing.

Amd has x86 cpu that is great and it has glusterfs that even if not nVidia level still can mine and game.

Ryzen 3600 and 3900 plus threadripper is a full package right now for cpu market for both low end PCs and higher end gaming platforms.

In the GPU market AMD has worse offering but buying nVidia is hard while getting AMD gpu is much easier.

I expect only great profits and further buildup. The only worry for me is right now ARM and Qualcomm and Apple but besides Apple M1 nobody seems to be able to produce decent arm  pc cpu so we have some time with AMD.

I expect AMD to hit 100 within 6 months. But that isn’t really moon material.

They're barely up on profit this year despite a large increase in revenue, and they're down two years ago and a year ago from three years ago.

3059,GME," Here you will find a bunch of people daydreaming and constructing delusional predictions after placing a terrible bet on a company that has a fair value of close to $5. 

A fair value is determined based on revenue / cash flow / other literal variables which are reported by the company itself. 

To say GME should be $50 a share is absolutely absurd and would put this company’s valuation at 4 billion dollars. 

Before the short squeeze, GME was valued at roughly 500 - 900 million dollars. Nothing at all has changed in the company since this time. 

This is where you draw the line between investment, and delusion. 

I hope to save the more intellectual portion of this thread the time, but for you who have a cultish mentality or need to resolve your losses:

3061,DD," The recent growth, those massive peaks in the $100+ excluded, has been purely due to good news like Ryan Cohen, Microsoft deal etc 
If i remember correctly from some DD i read about 2 months ago (so take it with a grain of salt) the just valuation for GME, even at it's worst technical state and as a dying brick and mortar chain, should have never dropped below $30 and float between 30 and 60, depending if bullish or bearish estimate.

Long term it works, but you need deep pockets to ride out any short term changes in spread between TLRY and APHA.

If you look at the chart at the all time high, the float back then was around 10% due to IPO investors being in lock-up. Since then, parent investors have retained the majority of the outstanding shares, keeping the float low. Short interest is high in the sector but particularly on this stock. Shorts are now covering with the merger on the horizon. This is affecting APHA directly, causing APHA to accelerate upwards, which in turn is affecting TLRY even more.

3178,APHA," I'm reposting one of my old comments thats answers your question.

I've been following this for a while. If the merger goes through APHA shareholders are given 0.8381 shares of TLRY for every APHA share they own. This has tied the share prices together due to the arbitrage opportunity. You have three major options that happen.

1. The merger doesn't happen and both APHA and TLRY take a hit.

2.The merger goes through and TLRY falls to close the gap between it and APHA (to make APHA price 83.81% of TLRY)

3.The merger goes through and APHA rises to meet TLRY (to make APHA price 83.81% of TLRY price)

TL;DR The short term play is TLRY but is risker and the long term play is APHA but carries much less risk than TLRY even in the short term. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🌕

Public perception on stuff like weed is changing, but while public perception of psychedelics is softening, the vast majority are against fully legalizing them. The really big factor in this has been the opiod epidemic. Big pharma spent almost 2 decades agressivley marketing them as a low cost non-addictive alternative to acually giving lower and lower middle class people real medical care. We all know how that panned out, and now societey has half a million people overdosing on the shit every year. This has made research groups very, VERY cautious about thier work inadvertantly creating the next street drug crisis. Its also made doctors hugeley adverse to prescribing any sort of potentially abused medication.

My, strictly sociological/criminological opinion is that its gonna take a while for folks to get over the gargantuan repurcussions of the doctor/big pharma spawned opiod epidemic before they become comfortable with psychedelic drugs being used medically outside of highly controlled and limited research lab settings.",Vict0r117,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lgz5jz/could_psychedelics_psyk_be_the_next_weed/gmv198z/,0.139,0.754,0.107,-0.7537

Actual Reasons to buy GME RN

Obligatory not financial advice, I’m holding GME etc etc

The company I work for sources unique data to take short term to long term positions (anywhere from 1-63 market days) in stocks that trade options.  Every day we produce a list of the top 20 stocks based on a number of data sets.  Over 3k stocks meet the criteria to be evaluated.

As of market close today GME (according to market makers) has a price target of $91.25 and a range index of 51.  There have been 37 instances in the past 5 years where GME has been in this position.  94% of the time it has either reached its target or timed out after 63 days for a gain with an average annual return of 348% compounded.

In short, crayon soup is on the menu and you should now be buying GME if you weren’t already.  Oh and last thing, it was ranked #1 on our buy list.",l_Pulser_l,94,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lgni07/why_finra_and_the_others_sis_dont_line_up/gmsgv1x/,0.0,0.953,0.047,0.7096

I turned off margin on my RH account beforehand as well but by default your account might still be considered margin from what i've been reading.

3340,RH," This is absolutely the primary reason (excluding margin account factors). They are completely overwhelmed. I’ve been waiting since 1/28 for the transfer to finish. My personal opinion is RH got screwed in all of this, however, it’s still their fault entirely. I suspect they did have their hand forced by the clearing house, and they don’t mean to be screwing up transfers, they just don’t have the staff to keep up. That said, both problems relate to RH not having the resources to be a reliable broker, and their lack of transparency is egregious and inexcusable. 

For anyone that hasn’t transferred but plans to do so, my recommendation is this: 1.) Document your positions, 2.) sell your positions one or two at a time every day or two, 3.) transfer the funds to your bank account when the transaction clears, 4.) deposit the funds in your new broker and rebuy. If you can afford it, make a deposit in your new broker first to rebuy your positions simultaneously as you go. By doing it this way, you can maintain control over your positions during the switch, and you can avoid a transfer fee. Believe me, there is nothing worse than being completely frozen out for two weeks (and counting) while invested in anything even remotely volatile.",heyimdong,34,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lggsmn/robinhood_cancelling_brokerage_transfers/gmreryq/,0.069,0.894,0.037,-0.6507

226% SI = Xshorts/70M

X = 2.26 \* 70M

78%SI = Yshorts/70M

Y = 0.78 \* 70M

Y = 54.6 M

So 78% SI has 54.6M shorts

To drop 226%SI(152Mshorts/70MOutShares) to 78%SI(54.6Mshorts/70MOutShares)

3462,AM," PLEASE READ EDIT3 BEFORE CONTINUING.

Here is some terminology for the apes out there:

Shares outstanding (total float): all shares that are held by individual investors and institutional groups, plus any restricted shares that are held by company insiders such as employees and executives. Restricted shares: shares that cannot be sold in the open market due to a restriction, like a time lock or employee compensation. Public (free) float: A company's ""float"" are the shares are available for trading on any given day — in other words, shares outstanding minus any restricted shares.

The Numbers:

Gamestop is shorted at 78% of the total float (shares outstanding) according to finra's new report today. There are exactly 69.75 million shares outstanding for gamestop. This means that 78% of 69.75 million shares are shorted, or ((69,750,000 / 100) * 78) = 54,405,000 shares short. Total free float varies between 49 million shares to 51 million shares according to yahoo finance and finvis, so lets assume this number is 50 million shares. The short of free float ratio is now 54,405,000 / 50,000,000 = 108% of free float.

Now this is where the numbers get really fucking interesting:

According to finra institutions own approximately 144 million shares (obviously this number is out of date, and cannot be factored in). According to yahoo finance, institutions own 122% of the free float (some institutions sold), which equates to ((50,000,000 / 100) * 122) = 61,000,000 shares. According to finviz, institutions own approximately 95% of the free float (some institutions sold), which equates to ((50,000,000 / 100) * 95) = 47,500,000 shares.

Lets assume the worst case scenario, where institutions only own 47,500,000 shares of the free float. This leaves 50,000,000 - 47,500,000 = 2,500,000 shares available to us WSB apes.

The best case scenario is that shorts must must buy back 54,405,000 shares from 2,500,000 shares from us, assuming institutions never sell from this point onward (this is not realistic at all, and will lead to the biggest MOASS)

The worse case scenario is that shorts must buy back and institutions sell like they did this time around. However, there is a caveat: why would institutions sell their stock when it is at 50 dollars? They are literally incentivized to jack the price up before they sell the stock for short sellers to buy back.

This leads to the average case scenario: stock shoots back up, and gamma squeeze will fuck these shorts up. Keep in mind that shorters are attempting to hedge their shorts with 800 dollar call options. If trading desks dont halt the stock, you can see some insane price action beyond 800 dollars. If they halt the stock, you can expect a similar outcome to what we've witnessed already.

EDIT: revised based on feedback. Thank you those who corrected me.

EDIT2:

Guys, stop saying that 78% is of the free float. The 78% is on the shares outstanding (also known as total float). Im recalculating the numbers with the below definition

Definition: When expressed as a percentage, short interest is the number of shorted shares divided by the number of shares outstanding. For example, a stock with 1.5 million shares sold short and 10 million shares outstanding has a short interest of 15% (1.5 million/10 million = 15%).

.78 = X/69,750,000, where x is the total number of shorted shares.

X = 54,405,000 shares shorted.

54,405,000 / 50,000,000 = 108% of free float is shorted.

Yes, math checks out.

EDIT3:

https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnys/gme/quote

Click the short interest, and its calculated with 78% based on the free float (21 million short / 27 million free float) = 78% short of free float. I AM MOST LIKELY WRONG WITH MY ORIGINAL POST ABOVE THESE EDITS.

3463,POST," PLEASE READ EDIT3 BEFORE CONTINUING.

Here is some terminology for the apes out there:

Shares outstanding (total float): all shares that are held by individual investors and institutional groups, plus any restricted shares that are held by company insiders such as employees and executives. Restricted shares: shares that cannot be sold in the open market due to a restriction, like a time lock or employee compensation. Public (free) float: A company's ""float"" are the shares are available for trading on any given day — in other words, shares outstanding minus any restricted shares.

The Numbers:

Gamestop is shorted at 78% of the total float (shares outstanding) according to finra's new report today. There are exactly 69.75 million shares outstanding for gamestop. This means that 78% of 69.75 million shares are shorted, or ((69,750,000 / 100) * 78) = 54,405,000 shares short. Total free float varies between 49 million shares to 51 million shares according to yahoo finance and finvis, so lets assume this number is 50 million shares. The short of free float ratio is now 54,405,000 / 50,000,000 = 108% of free float.

Now this is where the numbers get really fucking interesting:

According to finra institutions own approximately 144 million shares (obviously this number is out of date, and cannot be factored in). According to yahoo finance, institutions own 122% of the free float (some institutions sold), which equates to ((50,000,000 / 100) * 122) = 61,000,000 shares. According to finviz, institutions own approximately 95% of the free float (some institutions sold), which equates to ((50,000,000 / 100) * 95) = 47,500,000 shares.

Lets assume the worst case scenario, where institutions only own 47,500,000 shares of the free float. This leaves 50,000,000 - 47,500,000 = 2,500,000 shares available to us WSB apes.

The best case scenario is that shorts must must buy back 54,405,000 shares from 2,500,000 shares from us, assuming institutions never sell from this point onward (this is not realistic at all, and will lead to the biggest MOASS)

The worse case scenario is that shorts must buy back and institutions sell like they did this time around. However, there is a caveat: why would institutions sell their stock when it is at 50 dollars? They are literally incentivized to jack the price up before they sell the stock for short sellers to buy back.

This leads to the average case scenario: stock shoots back up, and gamma squeeze will fuck these shorts up. Keep in mind that shorters are attempting to hedge their shorts with 800 dollar call options. If trading desks dont halt the stock, you can see some insane price action beyond 800 dollars. If they halt the stock, you can expect a similar outcome to what we've witnessed already.

EDIT: revised based on feedback. Thank you those who corrected me.

EDIT2:

Guys, stop saying that 78% is of the free float. The 78% is on the shares outstanding (also known as total float). Im recalculating the numbers with the below definition

Definition: When expressed as a percentage, short interest is the number of shorted shares divided by the number of shares outstanding. For example, a stock with 1.5 million shares sold short and 10 million shares outstanding has a short interest of 15% (1.5 million/10 million = 15%).

.78 = X/69,750,000, where x is the total number of shorted shares.

X = 54,405,000 shares shorted.

54,405,000 / 50,000,000 = 108% of free float is shorted.

Yes, math checks out.

EDIT3:

https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnys/gme/quote

Click the short interest, and its calculated with 78% based on the free float (21 million short / 27 million free float) = 78% short of free float. I AM MOST LIKELY WRONG WITH MY ORIGINAL POST ABOVE THESE EDITS.

Keep in mind that prices were at 325 dollars a share when this was reported, so idk what to think about these numbers honestly.

The notice OP is talking about is in regards to FINRA's daily ""Short Sale Volume Data"".  [This volume can be found here](https://www.finra.org/finra-data/short-sale-volume-daily), and [here's a website that puts this data onto a nice chart](https://shortvolume.com/) since FINRA is a bunch of fat retarded pigs too busy sailing in their yachts to put a simple fucking bar chart on their website.  Be sure to change ticker to GME.

This data is roughly the % volume of shares traded hands, of a particular ticker, that were short sold.

The notice talks about why this data sucks and that they want to let you know why it sucks. Then they bend you over and stick their cock up your ass like so:

>Thus, to obtain a complete picture of short sale volume to total volume in a particular listed stock, market participants must combine data published by FINRA for each of its trade reporting facilities, as well as data published by the exchanges.

I don't know where the fuck myself, as a market participant, can find the data published by FINRA for each of its trade reporting facilities and the data published by the exchanges.  However, this is likely what S3 and Ortex do for a living.

---

[The FINRA report we are all waiting for](https://www.finra.org/filing-reporting/regulatory-filing-systems/short-interest) is called ""Short Interest Report"" -- it's a bi-monthly consolidation of all FINRA members' collective short interests.  Eg, Broker A shorted 10,000 GME, Broker B shorted 500,000 AMC... add it all up, and show the totals per ticker.

I also cannot find where to download this data.  And I cannot find the list of participants that have to submit their data to FINRA.  Is it brokers? Exchanges? DTCC?  No fucking clue.  Can't find any info on their website. But rest assured, FINRA has your back.

The truth of it is we have an extremely complex financial system; it has been made extremely complex through all of the myriad of different financial instruments, investment vehicles, derivatives, etc etc - mostly for the benefit of wall street to make more money.  
  
It CAN be understood, and (even though you may have to pay for subs to various sources) you CAN get all the data.  But it takes a lot of time and effort to be able to fully learn the ins and outs of the system and be able to follow the convoluted BS, and REALLY understand what the numbers mean.  
  
But really, any of us here thinking that we can look at a few basic numbers dumbed down for the general public and come to a correct conclusion that absolutely the shorts are in over their heads and we could easily force a short with the miniscule power of retail (by comparison anyways; even with 8 million people banded together in a stock, the reality is we command a far lower amount of capital than the big boys)... is a little arrogant.  
  
I'm not telling anyone to hold or buy more.  I'm not telling anyone to sell.  You do you.

3620,GME," I mean yes and no, Gamma is about the speed of the rise. As people are piling in and this is jumping 10, 20, 40% it's moving faster than the hedging ( becoming delta neutral) and creating a buying effect which squeezes the price until the hedge can be achieved, at which point it dumps as gamma slows down and as the price falls there is accelerated selling action as the MM's no longer need the shares to maintain their delta position.

It's not simply buying a bunch of OTM calls and waiting, although that is needed, as if I buy a bunch of 0.2 delta calls the MM only needs to buy \~20 shares per call but it also has to have a catalyst and move fast. These seem to be happening more to high short stocks (Tesla, GME, TLRY) so I imagine a component is a reduced float but haven't seen enough research on that to know.

I think a crash is coming, its the only way to balance the trillions they have printed is to erase trillions somewhere, or somehow. It will also benefit big money, because all the small retail investors looking into the market now will get burned and have to go lick their wounds, and most wont come back into the market after getting wiped out from a crash so this whole retail movement will just be eradicated as people lose their homes, cars, and go into debt.

I saw on a Youtube video the other day that 40% of all US currency in circulation right now was printed in the last year. Thats not good. However an interesting point the video made was that almost every major country is doing the same thing, step in step, with the US.

3645,GME," Me as well. Made some profits from GME and have a lot of it in cash still for when (not if) there is a correction. That is a good point about the Biden admin. being in a bit of a time squeeze if they want to say this was Trump’s doing. Though the low interest rates may keep this propped up for long enough that it makes its not necessarily a no brainer. Especially if it continues on this path until early summer. Though covid has affected a lot of people negatively, for those who’s work hasn’t been effected they have been able to save a lot more than usual and there’s no where else to put it that’s worthwhile. For those who’s work has been effected, if they weren’t unemployed they are making the same income, but the risk is to their safety. Which is terrible, but puts them in the same position as the other category when it comes with what to do with that $. Either way I think having some cash on hand for when that time comes would be a good idea. What I would have done to have cash sitting in my account during the covid crash, and not having it in a bank account / have to wait 3 business days (with my brokerage at least) before it would be available. The people who are able to make the most bread during bear markets. Everyone else is worried about the decline / tapping into their emergency savings as not to realize losses, while the people with cash on hand are...stocking up.

3719,BB, Hyundai's stock price just took a hit because they aren't going to be involved with apple car anymore if I'm not mistaken. Also BB stock is already very slightly pumped but they have earnings coming up in March and I don't think they have materialized any new revenues despite the good news. No doubt the last 3 earnings calls of the year and any other news that comes out is sure to give them a killer increase I just think they are propped up a dollar or 2 by paper hands that will pull out over a flat or negative earnings in March.,MrBaloonHands228,4,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lgl1ub/why_bbs_contract_with_motional_is_bigger_than_we/gmswt36/,0.176,0.759,0.065,-0.9403

You're right! That's also why I don't expect there to be a massive dip, direct listing allowed PLTR to sidestep the investment banking hype overdrives. 

The value we are seeing now is organic, tested in real market conditions and not on expectation pre-IPO.

3809,GME," The problem with holding is when a stock is shorted it basically creates two owners of the same share. 

1. Guy buys GME at $20 and holds it in his brokerage account 

2. HF borrows the share to short

3. Girl buys the same share of GME at $250 from the HF
 

In order for the hold strategy to work you would need both the guy and the girl to hold, the price has to go up And volume traded has to be low so longs cannot be recycled. But if the Girl bought it at $250 And the guy bought it at $20 their profitability points are very different so it’s going to be hard to get enough people on board for it to work for BOTH. In my retard opinion.

3895,MLM," Controversy

Between June and November 2017, advertising watchdog organization Truth in Advertising found that Beachbody distributors were making false and unsubstantiated income claims to promote the company’s business opportunity.[11] The FTC has stated that 99.6% of all MLM participants will lose money, after factoring in the costs to join.[12]

In 2017, Beachbody agreed to pay $3.6 million to settle a lawsuit from the city of Santa Monica over automatic credit card renewals. It was alleged that Beachbody was charging its customers’ credit cards on an automatic, recurring basis without the required written consent of those customers.[13]

SNDL for Idiots like me

I looked at my SNDL options this morning and was wondering what the fuck is going on. As it turns out, you fucking idiots have caught on which is great, but let me explain the fundamentals for the slower ones.

SNDL has been shit on by Wall Street for what feels like a millennia. Covid has mutated more times than these fucks have changed their narrative. For decent reason, the idiots running SNDL clearly haven’t been living to the mantra “don’t get high off your own supply” and running the ship like the fucking titanic. But when Wall Street talks, there’s something there. If there wasn’t money to be made they would not say a fucking word about it. So we dig in.

A couple months ago SNDL’s balance sheet looked like a drunk girl fighting gravity on a countertop. I think Enron had better numbers. Some how they were pivoting away from their main revenue streams and losing revenue month over month.... fucking shrinking like my dick on a winter morning.

That’s when Wall Street really turned up the fuck this stock rhetoric and said they would delist it. But then something interesting happened, WSB fuck bois pumped the stock with all the rest of the weed stocks but unlike everyone but the fucking hedge fund fucks.... SNDL’s leadership, did a line off a hookers asshole, and turned their debt into equity, raised money, and now sits on a $600M+ war chest to make acquisitions. These high rod fucks have enough cash to make Cheech and Chong look like fuckin mormons.

So what the fuck is the play? I bought .50 July 16 calls (for a fuckin premium at $.90) with a price target of $10 a share+ between now and July. 

Between the Ganja war chest and the imminent US federal legalization of marijuana this fucker is going to take off. Or I’ll lose some money but who gives a shit, literally betting on stoners to get high and sell weed which in my experience is a predictable business. 🚀🚀 to the fuckin moon, don’t bet money you can’t afford to lose. If I lose my grand it’s a few less lap dances when the strip clubs open.

Make money, don’t, I don’t fucking care, I’m not a financial advisor or a fuckin registered fuck, just an idiot who reads.

If they can’t keep 8 speakers and a sunroof running for more than a year how the fuck are they going to excel in the EV/tech space?

4069,CMPS," I think this is the most over valued stock in the sector and they are not ""Good People"". This company is not well liked in the industry, just got busted for basically trying to patent psychedelic therapy, entirely, and their med is the same as 25 others being developed. There is a lot of star power from the financial world, not the psychedelic world, and basically what they are trying to do is develop a non psychedelic daily med.

4070,FOR," Random note as some one that was addicted to Xanax. (used to treat the same things they want to use Shrooms for)

Those withdrawals where the worst part of my life that lasted close to 6 months.

Other random side note: the vitamin supplement I give to my dogs also has shrooms in it. Has a huge warning sign on it (NOT FOR HUMAN USE). My sister and her husband gifted it to me, but I know they buy a lot from Chewy.

Final Thought: I know we love Papa Thiel, but the biggest thing in the way of this is the American Government. Will be keeping an eye on it, but wont make a move until Green goes fully legal.

IMO, its probably one of the better positioned company to enter the market. Because of its farming business, it already has the infrastructure in place to export to the USA and can stay positive while they get the cannabis's side of their company sorted. 

As a side note, take my opinion with a grain of salt. I'm probably biased because I work as a manager at a local produce store in BC and I like the stock because they've constantly given me discounts of high quality produce so I'm making money with them either way lol.

4168,GE," So?

Rolls has no current engines suitable for a narrowbody airliner.  None.  Guess where most of Airbus' growth is?  If you said narrowbodies (A220/C-Series, A320) you'd be right.  There are two narrowbodies that use Rolls engines, the Boeing/MD 717 and the Boeing 757.  They both fit very unique niches but production of both has long since stopped and both models are being phased out by airlines.  Meanwhile GE (via CFM) has engines on every single 737 flying and a big chunk of the A320s. Pratt has all of Airbus' A220s.

Okay let's talk widebodies then.  They don't sell as well as narrowbodies by virtue of their size and cost.  The 767 is living on with the KC-46 (which has its own issues), but those are all powered by Pratt.  GE is the single source for current 777/777x engines.  Rolls offers engines for the 787 and they managed to snag exclusive rights to the A330neo and A350.  Great. The neo is limping along sales-wise while the A350 and 787 are doing great.  But there's a catch.  Rolls' Trent engines are unreliable and Rolls has been battling persistent problems with them.  Look at how many 787s were grounded last year waiting for engine replacements (this and the 787 teething problems really hurt Norwegian long haul).  Rolls has gone through a few revisions but the problems remain.  ETOPS certification got clawed back on the Rolls powered 787s.

And then there's the whole shift towards using narrowbodies on longer flights.  When air travel recovers you're likely to find that flying a larger chunk of the flights are on narrowbodies.  US flights to Hawaii and transatlantic flights are definitely shifting towards narrowbodies.  The days of being able to hop on a domestic DC-10 or Tristar are long gone.

Even when air travel starts to recover Rolls is not well positioned to profit.  They have a troublesome engine family to deal with (Trent) and no products to compete in the fastest growing market segment.  Yeah, sure, they're too big to fail.  But too big to fail doesn't mean too big to screw over the shareholders.  Rolls will be around in a few decades, your investment in them probably won't.

4193,DAL," I like southwest as well, but it was my second choice on a recovery play.  They're by far my favorite airline to fly, and I think with their large domestic presence they may recover first as no doubt demand is there domestically once vaccination numbers improve.  Southwest dropped from $58.83 in March, down to a ridiculous low of $22.47.  Their financials are dope, and that probably explains why they have recovered almost back to their pre-pandemic level, which, I still think is probably undervalued, their service is great and they continue to expand.

I went with UAL. Which at $43.32 as of close, is about half of what it was valued before the pandemic.  UAL dropped from $90 all the way to $17.89 as well, like somehow planes can catch the rona and need to be burned on the runway or something.  United has a much larger exposure to international and business travel, and that I believe will be the real trigger for thier rebound.  They are a larger bulkier airline and their 55 boarding groups are somewhat annoying, but they fly absolutely everywhere, they offer a more premium product to southwest in some aspects, and I think the pent up demand for international travel will boost UAL and DAL.  Even if business travel doesn't return in full force, pent up demand exists there as well.  Their financials aren't southwest good, but they're better than average, and they're prepared to weather the storm.
