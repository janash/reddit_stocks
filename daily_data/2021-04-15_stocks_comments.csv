Union vs. Non-Union definitely has different benefits and pay schedule, but in large cities both make more than enough to live a comfortable life. Union benefits are unreal - if you are able to get into the Union you have amazing health insurance, overtime, and a pension if you work enough time (10 years I think). I have worked with Union Electricians / Carpenters / Welders who are pulling down $150k-$200k per year or more including overtime. The demand for electricians and plumbers is so great that most of them work weekends for themselves and bring in even more money (usually not exactly kosher but everyone turns a blind eye).",Trisolaran_arbitrage,2,/r/stocks/comments/mrdwuq/state_jobless_claims_in_us_fall_to_lowest_since/gunkkez/,0.043,0.796,0.161,0.9664

10,NYC," Quick search through apprenticeship jobs in NYC appears to indicate that pay falls somewhere between $15-$30hr.

I'll also mention that per the BLS, wages your mentioning are not typical.

Electricians - $56,900 [(Source)](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/construction-and-extraction/electricians.htm)

Personally, I have mixed opinions on trade work. I think it can be a rewarding career alternative to retail/fast food/min wage positions or college. Several tradesmen I've known definitely paid the price with their bodies unless they transitioned to management.

15,FL," Maximum unemployment from the state in FL is $275

Federal gov paid another $600 at first, and then that lowered to $300. That comes out to $875/week, equivalent to a 46k year job (!!) and then $575/week, equivalent to a 30k/year job.

That is, of course, assuming the person places ZERO value on having free time and less stress.

I personally know people who could have worked for the last year and have chosen not to. And I don't blame them, I think they'd be foolish to take a job when they could get paid just as much without the stress or various job-related expenses like gas/clothes. I think you can certainly argue that for the sake of public health and financial security they were a great benefit, but to deny that the payments may stifle jobseeking is almost comical levels of denial.",pfSonata,1,/r/stocks/comments/mrdwuq/state_jobless_claims_in_us_fall_to_lowest_since/gunueoe/,0.088,0.807,0.105,0.3808

106,DKNG," I think those two deals go hand in hand. They were announced roughly around the same time. Genius Sports has the exclusive rights to collect and distribute the NFL Data. Genius Sports will be supplying the data through their feeds. These feeds make up the majority of DKNG’s in-game gross gaming revenue (GGR). Since DKNG signed an agreement with Genius, they’ve shown exponential growth in their GGR. (Check their earnings/presentations I don’t remember the numbers)

For reference, in 2018 NCAA formed a 10-year partnership with Genius to build and implement NCAA Live Stats. This data system, mind you, includes March Madness. The terms of the deal allows them to hold the exclusive license to distribute their data to third parties. Think CBS, Turner, etc. So now, Genius Sports gets paid by implementing these live data feeds from the leagues (NCAA, NFL, EPL) and they get paid to distribute their data feeds to Draftkings, William Hill, etc.

Draftkings doesn’t create these exclusive feeds and data, rather they now expand their partnership with NFL (So did Caesar’s entertainment and FanDuel FYI) and can implement their product on NFL Media Properties (think NFL.com and the NFL)  App). But now since they’re exclusive partners, they will be using the league’s official data feed (Genius Sports). And these data feeds are how DKNG gets their odds. 

I don’t think Draftkings wants to go in to the business of creating their own data right now, as the current big players have signed multi year, possibly even decade long deals.

108,AAPL," Ok, here is the thing. The stocks you have been buying looks like you scanned through the top posts of /r/wallstreetbets and bought those companies. This, in general, is a very risky plan. Especially buying companies in highly speculative industries like cannabis or EVs. 

Now, if you really believe in those companies, a 25% loss over 2 months shouldn't faze you. Two months is basically no time at all. Stop looking at investing as a month by month endeavor and start thinking years in the future. If you think these are good companies, you should be looking to hold them for multiple years. If you believe in these companies, and hold them, it is possible that you see them gain back your losses. 

If you don't believe in these companies, you should sell, eat your losses and move on to things you believe in.

There are a lot of comments suggesting buying AAPL, AMZN, or MSFT. However, you must realize that there is no individual stock that is 'safe'. Some are 'safer' than others, but ALL individual stocks have substantial risks. Even the bluest of blue chip companies can falter. Do I think it is likely for AAPL or MSFT to stay flat or lose value over the next few years? No, I don't believe that is likely. However, what if the newest iPhone is a flop? What if Azure is the victim of a serious security breach?

Buying ETFs is less risky, but still involves risk. Especially if those ETFs specialize in a specific sector. But, in general, they are less risky than individual stocks because ETFs generally hold many, many individual stocks and the performance of a single company is weighted far less as a total of your investment .

If you are looking for the safest investment, put your money in a high yield savings account. The next safest option is probably long term government bonds. The next safest option is highly diversified ETFs. ETFs like VTI, SPY, VOO, etc, are not devoid of risk, but will generally track the performance of market, are relatively stable, and generally go up over the long term.

If you are happy with market returns, putting all your money into VTI is a good, 'safe', plan. If you want to beat the market, then you'll need to invest in specific sectors or companies that you believe will do better than the market.

113,PLTR," Everyone is in the same boat dude.
It depends on what is your strategy...
I usually put more and more money every month, with other sources of income, so if a stock goes down let's say 10%, then i average down, since I am averaged down, it won't take the 10% back to go back up... Like this, in a long run, you can get your money back, but if you have put let's say 10k aside and ia only gonna use this 10k to keep growing, it is much harder to recover the losses...

I bought PLTR in any price you can think of, from 20 to 35, i got to be around -15% in PLTR, now that I averaged down to around 23.50, i am breaking even this way.

In my opinion that is a safer way to recover your losses.

But if you don't have a second or third source of income to be covering the losses and trying to balance out, at the moment is very hard to recommend anything, since the market is very uncertain at this point.",GLUB_GLUB-GLUB,5,/r/stocks/comments/mrftxt/safe_stock_or_etf_plays/gum3728/,0.066,0.875,0.059,-0.3035

160,ATH," **Daily Stock Market Forecast**

Things are looking bright and sunny today.

* Companies are smashing earnings expectations across the board
* Unemployment is dropping faster than expected. [Initial jobless claims](https://www.dol.gov/ui/data.pdf) were were 576,000, the lowest in more than a year, and well below the forecast of 710,000.
* [Retail sales](https://www.census.gov/retail/marts/www/marts_current.pdf) are booming, up 9.8% compared to a forecast 6.1%.

I'm forecasting a **green day** with a NASDAQ **high of 14,102** and a **low of 13,996**. 

That would put us just a little shy of ATH at today's peak.

207,AZN," Trying to figure out the option play with the vaccine rollout. There are in my mind four companies - Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca and J&J. it seems odd that the AZN and JJ vaccines are effectively suspended for having stated blood clots issues arising in 39/17,000,000 and 6/7,000,000 respectively. The blood clot issues from people who catch Covid are according to my reading of the WSJ (today's) more than at least five times as high. Specifically looking at the numbers that matter, it was reported that MDNA receives $240 per shot, PFE $125 per shot while JJ receives $18 to 22 per shot and AZN receives $5. I may have these numbers slightly wrong but am sure I will be corrected.

Is it just my misreading or is there something up with the numbers. Who stands to gain at MDNA and PFE - are there government contracts being given and allowing certain affiliated persons to profit? Why does it seem that countries that can afford to pay are being pushed to the higher priced alternatives.

It seems like there is no price impediment to MDNA/PFE right now and we should pile into these stocks for the short to medium term.

The stock market in general always has a lot of ups and downs, and the steep bull run of 2020 from the feds pumping trillions into the market was bound to stop eventually.

272,NOV," the only lessons are that stocks drop sometimes, you can't predict the market, and that confirmation bias is real.

let's say that its Dec 2021 and spec stocks full recover while boomer stocks start dying. the lesson then is going to be ""hold growth stocks and don't chase short term gains""

if spec stocks don't recover until a few years from now the lesson is going to be ""Feb-march"" was just a mini bubble, you need to hold high conviction plays.

if the whole market crashes in june the lesson is going to be ""see, pay attention to the overbought signals, the market was going to collapse its too high""

Here's a fun exercise for confirmation bias: imagine going back in time to when biden got elected in NOV and telling your november self: ""puts on all clean energy, calls on oil and brick and mortar banks and carnival cruise lines. puts on all growth stocks"" your old self would probably start maniacally laughing ""REALLY? you want me to buy calls on oil and brick and mortar banks and CHEESECAKE FACTORY and buy puts on clean energy? in a biden presidency?

We are going through 3 major phases in information

1. Explosion to access to information
-Birth of World Wide Web, and cataloguing of anything and everything from junk to breakthrough science/technology 

2. Storage and mining of information
-What are are going through now. Facebook, google, Amazon, targeted ads, companies, manufacturing shipping, you name it. Getting and holding data is king.

3. Making sense of this stupid amount of information we have
-The is the thing no one really has elegantly solved yet. How do you efficiently go through all this insane amount of information easily? How many times or people do you know who work in supply chains are frustrated as shit because every single system is clunky, Frankensteined together with different systems, legacy systems etc

Palantir I think offers a real solution to 3

I work in medical and their double click demo on healthcare systems fkn tore me a new asshole. And it’s exactly what I’m saying about point 3. We have the capacity to capture so much fucken information these days but no useful way of accessing it and linking things together

Palantir is basically the abacus. It’s a tool that assists humans to improve their intelligence and output artificially.

Maybe someone who works in supply chains can chime in.

Will a % of my portfolio sit there for a long time and maybe not do much? Sure, it’s possible.

I've heard a lot of good things about COIN. Cramer likes the management team and the plan. It's almost like Paypal. I love the stock but it's too expensive FOR ME. I can't find a good entry point. I lost a little on Paypal because I didn't wait for a good entry point. 

Cramer says buy COIN below the mid $400. Maybe he is right, but I'm having problems calculating my valuation of this investment. This is also a meme stock and I don't like trading them. Religious belief can change fast, so I'm careful around these kinds of stock.

My plan is too wait for the price to stabilize before I invest. Typically the stock price is controlled by forces we barely understand after a IPO.  I'm not smart enough to play that game.

You can't buy bitcoin in a 401. Also, there are some ETF's that we can buy but they charge 2% or more for the privilege. I don't pay 2% without some guarantees. And, importantly, compared to my 401 my after tax account is a hobby.

Also, only a fool would not consider what happens when things go bad. Notice I said when, not if. Everything eventually goes bad. Even Bitcoin.

360,COIN," Excellent points!  We can also use other industries to see how they transitioned and new players were brought in:

* Western Union charges a whole lot of money to remit currencies to a different location.  It's not just the fee's, but the FOREX spread which they capture.  They are obviously high cost, but the value is also high because of the ease in which to pick up payments in thousands of locations.

* Banks and PayPal are middle of the road here.  They'll have a FOREX spread which benefits them and also charge a fee.  

* Wise (or whatever they are now) are the best in terms of fixed fees and very close to real-time XE exchange rates when doing global money transfers.  

Any of those companies (and banking institutions) can do what COIN does right now, and the fee structure will be identical to what is happening at real-time.   So COIN will need to include other services, such as portfolio or investment options.  

Retail users will go with what they know, and what is easiest.  COIN is very new and doesn't have the known branding.  Then users will want to know how much they could have made / saved and as such, shop their options.

Looking at Robinhood (RH) as an example.  People got in, but a whole lot of them transferred out to Fidelity, E*Trade and others with no consequences.  It's simply that easy in this day and age for stocks for a 3-5 day transfer to occur and all equities winding up with the new firm.",Qs9bxNKZ,1,/r/stocks/comments/mr3ex1/when_i_hear_about_coinbase_being_a_bad_investment/guk2l9a/,0.016,0.857,0.127,0.9857

TSLA would be a good example of what I am speaking of. In FA I wouldn't buy in until the high 300 low 400 range, but the public has faith and wants to see it much higher. I don't think they are more valuable than all of the other auto makers (yet), but if you want to wait a few years or decades for their profits to catch up so you can put some in your retirement account than you would have missed a lot of large gains (and potential losses obviously).

362,TSLA, Well like I said if your swing trading and day trading yeah FA doesnt really matter but like I said if you plan on holding a stock for the long term I am talking years than yeah FA is very important. Tesla fundamentals are overall not that bad. As of right now yeah their earnings are no way reflecting on the stock price but their profit margins are increasing very rapidly. This shows that they are improving their fundamentals and becoming more and more profitable. Will their earnings justify their current price in the future? Probably not because they are already priced in at a 700 billion dollar company. Me personally I dont care about short term volatility because I buy and hold stocks long term so FA is very important for me. Also you make it sound like taking advantage of short term volatility and hype speculation is super easy way to make money in the market which it is absolutely not. Thats how a lot of new people who go into the stock market with no education and think its a get rich easy scheme lose a bunch of money. I can give you many examples but I would just use one that we are discussing which is TSLA. A lot of people did buy into the hype and bought Tesla at the $890.00 mark. Because “Meme stonks never go down 🚀🚀🚀” You can even go on the Twitter Tesla group and there was a lot crybaby idoits on there tweeting at Elon saying that bought TSLA believing in him and he failed them.

They can grow market share all they want but growing market share 5-10% when the market is shrinking 25%+ means revenue and profit are both going down and they'll take the share price with it.

Your P/E thesis is predicated on the idea that people will be happy to pay twice the price for half the revenue. I don't believe that will be true. I see P/Es holding at current levels and *maybe* going a little higher which means the share price will decrease with the decrease in earnings.

465,DKNG," I do think DKNG is aggressively priced but I absolutely think it's warranted and I'm really high on the future of it and this industry in general.

I was reading that the estimated betting handle on the sports betting market between legal and illegal bets in the US was somewhere around $250B. Books make about 6-8% of the handle so that makes sports betting roughly a $15-20B industry in its current structure for revenue. Mix in Canada once they approve single game wagering and the growth from exposure and having betting widely available and I would not be shocked if that number doubles if not even more once legal widespread betting is available.

Also I love the groundwork that DKNG has laid, earnings has been mostly held back by advertising and promotional costs but it's clearly paying off. DKNG has heavy market shares in a lot of newly expanded states. Mix that in with the NFL Deal, talks for a deal with Action Network, and all the other deals you referenced, it's a no brainer to me.  I believe will ultimately end up being the #1 Sportsbook in the US with FanDuel being a close second and other books like Barstool and MGM being formidable and getting their share.

I came into investing into this industry with a blank slate in terms of who I wanted to commit my money to and just firmly believing this industry was going to be huge. DKNG has impressed me more than everybody else thus far and by a pretty good margin

509,CVX," Some general advice that I try to employ as part of my own investment process:

- The old adage that ""if you get the buying right, you don't need to worry about the selling"" has a lot going for it: whenever possible, I invest in companies that I ideally want to hold ""forever""
- I generally don't sell to ""take a profit"", I only sell when I need money for a better investment and when I do, I sell my worst investment / lowest conviction idea first (not the one with the largest gain or loss or anything like that)
- I avoid making investment decisions primarily based on tax considerations (this has never worked out well for me in the end)

In your case, I see the first two points in slight contradiction. IMHO (and I really hate to give you direct advice, but I will anyway), you own businesses that are not good long-term businesses even in good times. Some specific comments:

- DAL: the stock was *much* lower than it is now in 2016 after the Brexit scare of UK/US business travel impact. Doesn't that seem ridiculous compared to what state the whole industry is in now? It's a cyclical trade that could work out for a bit longer, but in the long run, this would be a poor business to own *even* if it wasn't drastically impaired by all the debt, dilution and labor etc. issues that will be coming when things finally (who knows when) return to normal for the airlines.

- BA: see above. The best bull case for this cyclical that I hear is that ""the government won't let them go bankrupt"". I'd personally rather hold businesses where avoiding bankruptcy is not the primary concern...

- XOM: read some critical analysis on their ability to continue dividend coverage and debt service. You also hold CVX (which is much better positioned) and CVX will benefit from recovery in oil prices and E&P when that finally comes (I believe it will).

To summarize: go over the businesses that you own, do the DD, figure which for you are businesses you want to be a long-term ""part owner"" of and which were just trades and then ""close out"" the trades.

If you're buying weeklies for example, and AAPL drops 2% from $132, your $132.50 will drop more. 2% will increase IV, but the loss from the movement and theta will negate the IV bump since it's so close to expiry. 35-40+ DTE, the effects will be less.

let's say you get the 950 strike '23 LEAP for $2525. I'm thinking the basic nature of your question means you can't afford much more, and if you could, I don't know why you would choose gme at this point, but I digress... Stonk just had a big day 30% gain on contract, so if you buy now and it falls back, you can quickly lose 30% value or more in a flash. no big deal you have time to recover, right?

Theta won't start hurting until you're 60-45 days out from expiration, and then it ramps up quickly, losing more and more value each day. So you'd have from now until Halloween '22 before you have to worry about that. But if on that date GME is at $500, and after 2 years the IV dropped (.77 Vega!), that contract will not be very valuable.

If you were to exercise, then you need to be ITM and have $95,000 on hand to purchase the shares. And GME needs to be at 975 for you to profit. 

Imo, best hope is that you buy right before or intraday during a big run and get out just as quickly. If you're thinking far OTM Leaps are a cheaper way to bag hold I think you'll end up disappointed.

519,GME," You absolutely can get IV crushed on a LEAP

And yes Theta does matter


If your stock (GME) doesn't make any significant movements towards the strike, the LEAP will slowly bleed Theta over time.  While you may intend to exercise the call, if you ever need liquidity you may not be able to exit the position at a favorable valuation.

Secondly, you need to compare the extrinsic and intrinsic value of your LEAP.  GME has very high IV, so it's likely your LEAP will have a significant amount of IV priced in.

If the implied volatility of GME falls, it'll affect your LEAP as well.  As of today, it looks like the Jan2023 LEAPs (>.85 delta) are pricing GME @$200 or so.

521,GME," You will absolutely get crushed opening a leap call on GME. Volatility plays a huge role in option pricing...and has a great impact on leaps. I haven’t checked the latest volatility reading for GME but I’m fairly certain it’s still through the roof.

Look at it this way: At the money contracts in both TSLA ($723) and GME ($166) have very similar prices! There’s a $557 difference in the underlying yet contract premiums are comparable. This should be a big indicator that GME contracts are factoring in tons of volatility. 

Before opening any leaps I would suggest fully understanding the Greeks, volatility and how they impact option premium. Look into IVPercentile/IVRank as a way to determine when’s a good time to open leaps (or any option position in general)

EDIT: After going over your post again you definitely need a crash course in options. 

Intrinsic value = options value if you exercised contract (ie: $20call on XYZ trading @ $25 would have 5.00 of intrinsic value)

Extrinsic value = options value derived from time and volatility

2. MAXN crushed EPS

574,ID," Short answer: Yes, possibly.

Long answer: VW Group sold 232k EVs in 2020, the third most of any auto manufacturer. They sold the 2nd most automobiles globally of any auto manufacturer in 2020. They're the biggest car company in Europe and in China, two quickly expanding EV markets. They have a global network of dealerships and deep pockets. The ID.4 is getting good reviews and I think it will sell well. In the long run I think they will surpass Tesla. Whether they reach 600k EV sales this year will depend on demand and production capacity. It seems to me that demand for vehicles globally is still somewhat weak but once it does recover I expect VW to become a major player in the EV market.",Endurance_Cyclist,3,/r/stocks/comments/mr5nbu/could_the_next_tesla_sell_600000_battery_electric/gukgxdx/,0.035,0.914,0.051,0.2724
