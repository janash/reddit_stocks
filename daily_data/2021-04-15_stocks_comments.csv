Now, if you really believe in those companies, a 25% loss over 2 months shouldn't faze you. Two months is basically no time at all. Stop looking at investing as a month by month endeavor and start thinking years in the future. If you think these are good companies, you should be looking to hold them for multiple years.

If you don't believe in these companies, you should sell, eat your losses and move on to things you believe in.

There are a lot of comments suggesting buying AAPL, AMZN, or MSFT. However, you must realize that there is no individual stock that is 'safe'. Some are 'safer' than others, but ALL individual stocks have substantial risks. Even the bluest of blue chip companies can falter. Do I think it is likely for AAPL or MSFT to stay flat or lose value over the next few years? No, I don't believe that is likely. However, what if the newest iPhone is a flop? What if Azure is the victim of a serious security breach?

Buying ETFs is less risky, but still involves risk. Especially if those ETFs specialize in a specific sector. But, in general, they are less risky than individual stocks because ETFs generally hold many, many individual stocks and the performance of a single company is weighted far less as a total of your investment .

If you are looking for the safest investment, put your money in a high yield savings account. The next safest option is probably long term government bonds.

100,PLTR," Everyone is in the same boat dude.
It depends on what is your strategy...
I usually put more and more money every month, with other sources of income, so if a stock goes down let's say 10%, then i average down, since I am averaged down, it won't take the 10% back to go back up... Like this, in a long run, you can get your money back, but if you have put let's say 10k aside and ia only gonna use this 10k to keep growing, it is much harder to recover the losses...

I bought PLTR in any price you can think of, from 20 to 35, i got to be around -15% in PLTR, now that I averaged down to around 23.50, i am breaking even this way.

139,ATH," **Daily Stock Market Forecast**

Things are looking bright and sunny today.

* Companies are smashing earnings expectations across the board
* Unemployment is dropping faster than expected. [Initial jobless claims](https://www.dol.gov/ui/data.pdf) were were 576,000, the lowest in more than a year, and well below the forecast of 710,000.
* [Retail sales](https://www.census.gov/retail/marts/www/marts_current.pdf) are booming, up 9.8% compared to a forecast 6.1%.

I'm forecasting a **green day** with a NASDAQ **high of 14,102** and a **low of 13,996**. 

That would put us just a little shy of ATH at today's peak.

180,AZN," Trying to figure out the option play with the vaccine rollout. There are in my mind four companies - Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca and J&J. it seems odd that the AZN and JJ vaccines are effectively suspended for having stated blood clots issues arising in 39/17,000,000 and 6/7,000,000 respectively. The blood clot issues from people who catch Covid are according to my reading of the WSJ (today's) more than at least five times as high. Specifically looking at the numbers that matter, it was reported that MDNA receives $240 per shot, PFE $125 per shot while JJ receives $18 to 22 per shot and AZN receives $5. I may have these numbers slightly wrong but am sure I will be corrected.

Is it just my misreading or is there something up with the numbers. Who stands to gain at MDNA and PFE - are there government contracts being given and allowing certain affiliated persons to profit? Why does it seem that countries that can afford to pay are being pushed to the higher priced alternatives.

It seems like there is no price impediment to MDNA/PFE right now and we should pile into these stocks for the short to medium term.

254,NOV," the only lessons are that stocks drop sometimes, you can't predict the market, and that confirmation bias is real.

let's say that its Dec 2021 and spec stocks full recover while boomer stocks start dying. the lesson then is going to be ""hold growth stocks and don't chase short term gains""

if spec stocks don't recover until a few years from now the lesson is going to be ""Feb-march"" was just a mini bubble, you need to hold high conviction plays.

if the whole market crashes in june the lesson is going to be ""see, pay attention to the overbought signals, the market was going to collapse its too high""

&#x200B;

Here's a fun exercise for confirmation bias: imagine going back in time to when biden got elected in NOV and telling your november self: ""puts on all clean energy, calls on oil and brick and mortar banks and carnival cruise lines. puts on all growth stocks"" your old self would probably start maniacally laughing ""REALLY? you want me to buy calls on oil and brick and mortar banks and CHEESECAKE FACTORY and buy puts on clean energy? in a biden presidency?

283,PLTR," It’s hard to explain a position like this succinctly but I’ll try (and admit I could be entirely wrong)

We are going through 3 major phases in information

1. Explosion to access to information
-Birth of World Wide Web, and cataloguing of anything and everything from junk to breakthrough science/technology 

2. Storage and mining of information
-What are are going through now. Facebook, google, Amazon, targeted ads, companies, manufacturing shipping, you name it. Getting and holding data is king.

3. Making sense of this stupid amount of information we have
-The is the thing no one really has elegantly solved yet. How do you efficiently go through all this insane amount of information easily? How many times or people do you know who work in supply chains are frustrated as shit because every single system is clunky, Frankensteined together with different systems, legacy systems etc

Palantir I think offers a real solution to 3

I work in medical and their double click demo on healthcare systems fkn tore me a new asshole. And it’s exactly what I’m saying about point 3. We have the capacity to capture so much fucken information these days but no useful way of accessing it and linking things together

Palantir is basically the abacus. It’s a tool that assists humans to improve their intelligence and output artificially.

Maybe someone who works in supply chains can chime in.

Disclosure: I hold PLTR for long

Will a % of my portfolio sit there for a long time and maybe not do much? Sure, it’s possible.

346,COIN," Excellent points!  We can also use other industries to see how they transitioned and new players were brought in:

* Western Union charges a whole lot of money to remit currencies to a different location.  It's not just the fee's, but the FOREX spread which they capture.  They are obviously high cost, but the value is also high because of the ease in which to pick up payments in thousands of locations.

* Banks and PayPal are middle of the road here.  They'll have a FOREX spread which benefits them and also charge a fee.  

* Wise (or whatever they are now) are the best in terms of fixed fees and very close to real-time XE exchange rates when doing global money transfers.  

Any of those companies (and banking institutions) can do what COIN does right now, and the fee structure will be identical to what is happening at real-time.   So COIN will need to include other services, such as portfolio or investment options.  

Retail users will go with what they know, and what is easiest.  COIN is very new and doesn't have the known branding.  Then users will want to know how much they could have made / saved and as such, shop their options.

Looking at Robinhood (RH) as an example.  People got in, but a whole lot of them transferred out to Fidelity, E*Trade and others with no consequences.  It's simply that easy in this day and age for stocks for a 3-5 day transfer to occur and all equities winding up with the new firm.",Qs9bxNKZ,1,/r/stocks/comments/mr3ex1/when_i_hear_about_coinbase_being_a_bad_investment/guk2l9a/,0.016,0.857,0.127,0.9857
347,TSLA," I'm not dissing FA, but I'm also pointing out that it's not the only way to make profits. At the end of the day if you only use FA then you are ignoring a lot of potential volatility from positive social sentiment, but everyone has a strat that is for their comfort level. TSLA would be a good example of what I am speaking of. In FA I wouldn't buy in until the high 300 low 400 range, but the public has faith and wants to see it much higher. I don't think they are more valuable than all of the other auto makers (yet), but if you want to wait a few years or decades for their profits to catch up so you can put some in your retirement account than you would have missed a lot of large gains (and potential losses obviously).

348,TSLA, Well like I said if your swing trading and day trading yeah FA doesnt really matter but like I said if you plan on holding a stock for the long term I am talking years than yeah FA is very important. Tesla fundamentals are overall not that bad. As of right now yeah their earnings are no way reflecting on the stock price but their profit margins are increasing very rapidly. This shows that they are improving their fundamentals and becoming more and more profitable. Will their earnings justify their current price in the future? Probably not because they are already priced in at a 700 billion dollar company. Me personally I dont care about short term volatility because I buy and hold stocks long term so FA is very important for me. Also you make it sound like taking advantage of short term volatility and hype speculation is super easy way to make money in the market which it is absolutely not. Thats how a lot of new people who go into the stock market with no education and think its a get rich easy scheme lose a bunch of money. I can give you many examples but I would just use one that we are discussing which is TSLA. A lot of people did buy into the hype and bought Tesla at the $890.00 mark. Because “Meme stonks never go down 🚀🚀🚀” You can even go on the Twitter Tesla group and there was a lot crybaby idoits on there tweeting at Elon saying that bought TSLA believing in him and he failed them. Like I said I can give you many examples of people getting burned on short term volatility in the market.

When/if Boeing will be able to reinstate the dividend again is unknown, but isn't expected for another five to ten years.  And when the dividend returns, it won't be 8% (more like 3%).

- The old adage that ""if you get the buying right, you don't need to worry about the selling"" has a lot going for it: whenever possible, I invest in companies that I ideally want to hold ""forever""
- I generally don't sell to ""take a profit"", I only sell when I need money for a better investment and when I do, I sell my worst investment / lowest conviction idea first (not the one with the largest gain or loss or anything like that)
- I avoid making investment decisions primarily based on tax considerations (this has never worked out well for me in the end)

In your case, I see the first two points in slight contradiction. IMHO (and I really hate to give you direct advice, but I will anyway), you own businesses that are not good long-term businesses even in good times. Some specific comments:

- DAL: the stock was *much* lower than it is now in 2016 after the Brexit scare of UK/US business travel impact. Doesn't that seem ridiculous compared to what state the whole industry is in now? It's a cyclical trade that could work out for a bit longer, but in the long run, this would be a poor business to own *even* if it wasn't drastically impaired by all the debt, dilution and labor etc. issues that will be coming when things finally (who knows when) return to normal for the airlines.

- BA: see above. The best bull case for this cyclical that I hear is that ""the government won't let them go bankrupt"". I'd personally rather hold businesses where avoiding bankruptcy is not the primary concern...

- XOM: read some critical analysis on their ability to continue dividend coverage and debt service. You also hold CVX (which is much better positioned) and CVX will benefit from recovery in oil prices and E&P when that finally comes (I believe it will).

To summarize: go over the businesses that you own, do the DD, figure which for you are businesses you want to be a long-term ""part owner"" of and which were just trades and then ""close out"" the trades.

In your case, I see the first two points in slight contradiction. IMHO (and I really hate to give you direct advice, but I will anyway), you own businesses that are not good long-term businesses even in good times. Some specific comments:

- DAL: the stock was *much* lower than it is now in 2016 after the Brexit scare of UK/US business travel impact. Doesn't that seem ridiculous compared to what state the whole industry is in now? It's a cyclical trade that could work out for a bit longer, but in the long run, this would be a poor business to own *even* if it wasn't drastically impaired by all the debt, dilution and labor etc. issues that will be coming when things finally (who knows when) return to normal for the airlines.

- BA: see above. The best bull case for this cyclical that I hear is that ""the government won't let them go bankrupt"". I'd personally rather hold businesses where avoiding bankruptcy is not the primary concern...

- XOM: read some critical analysis on their ability to continue dividend coverage and debt service. You also hold CVX (which is much better positioned) and CVX will benefit from recovery in oil prices and E&P when that finally comes (I believe it will).

To summarize: go over the businesses that you own, do the DD, figure which for you are businesses you want to be a long-term ""part owner"" of and which were just trades and then ""close out"" the trades. When you own a high quality compounder, ""nobody ever went broke taking a profit"" is stupid advice - but here it might apply.",snake250,2,/r/stocks/comments/mrht3l/one_year_later/gun9fok/,0.121,0.795,0.083,-0.9442

If your stock (GME) doesn't make any significant movements towards the strike, the LEAP will slowly bleed Theta over time.  While you may intend to exercise the call, if you ever need liquidity you may not be able to exit the position at a favorable valuation.

Secondly, you need to compare the extrinsic and intrinsic value of your LEAP.  GME has very high IV, so it's likely your LEAP will have a significant amount of IV priced in.

500,GME," You will absolutely get crushed opening a leap call on GME. Volatility plays a huge role in option pricing...and has a great impact on leaps. I haven’t checked the latest volatility reading for GME but I’m fairly certain it’s still through the roof.

Look at it this way: At the money contracts in both TSLA ($723) and GME ($166) have very similar prices! There’s a $557 difference in the underlying yet contract premiums are comparable. This should be a big indicator that GME contracts are factoring in tons of volatility. 

Before opening any leaps I would suggest fully understanding the Greeks, volatility and how they impact option premium. Look into IVPercentile/IVRank as a way to determine when’s a good time to open leaps (or any option position in general)

EDIT: After going over your post again you definitely need a crash course in options. 

Intrinsic value = options value if you exercised contract (ie: $20call on XYZ trading @ $25 would have 5.00 of intrinsic value)

If you own the shares you'll have a gain as long as the shares go up.  If you buy the 900 strike option, it might not print at all.  if GME goes to only $800 by Jan 2022, your option will be worthless while your shares are nearly 5x more.

Also, it's possible for a squeeze to take months or years to happen.  TSLA for example.  If you're wrong on the timing then you've just thrown away money you could have spent on shares.",Grand_Barnacle_6922,3,/r/stocks/comments/mr5pze/question_regarding_buying_long_options_vs_buying/gukur7h/,0.082,0.783,0.135,0.7463
521,GME," I’m very bullish on GME right now so don’t take this the wrong way but if you buy a $900 strike price call you will lose all your money guaranteed. That’s over 1 thousand dollars you’ll literally give to whoever sells it to you. Wait for a big dip (it’s coming) and buy the shares or a deep in the money call that expires that week or the next. It’s so volatile right now it not worth the risk.

550,ID," Short answer: Yes, possibly.

Long answer: VW Group sold 232k EVs in 2020, the third most of any auto manufacturer. They sold the 2nd most automobiles globally of any auto manufacturer in 2020. They're the biggest car company in Europe and in China, two quickly expanding EV markets. They have a global network of dealerships and deep pockets. The ID.4 is getting good reviews and I think it will sell well. In the long run I think they will surpass Tesla. Whether they reach 600k EV sales this year will depend on demand and production capacity. It seems to me that demand for vehicles globally is still somewhat weak but once it does recover I expect VW to become a major player in the EV market.",Endurance_Cyclist,3,/r/stocks/comments/mr5nbu/could_the_next_tesla_sell_600000_battery_electric/gukgxdx/,0.035,0.914,0.051,0.2724
