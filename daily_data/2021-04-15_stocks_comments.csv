I guess a kind of extreme example would be if a man named Joe has had mental health issues in the past, spends lots of time in ""extremest"" online chat groups, and has been arrested before, tries to enter a movie theater. The AI can scan his face, pair it to the records and possibly prevent him from entering the building under suspicion - maybe he recently purchased a gun.

You’re not emotionally immature. And you don’t have to invest in only index funds (although it wouldn’t hurt to have a good chunk of your money in them)

I made good money in January too and lost a bunch of my gains in February and March. It happens. The market was pretty rough for a month and a half depending on what you were invested in. It sounds like you were swing trading (not day trading like some people assumed) and overleveraged. I’ve learned that lesson too, and although it hurts now this is probably one of the best lessons you’ll learn. Could be worse.. you could’ve pulled a Bill Hwang.

I rarely do just calls or puts anymore bc I’ve been burned before like you have. Spreads are great.. not sure if you were doing mostly calls or had some debit spreads in there, but theta can chew up your premium pretty quick even with multiple legs.

I’d use the next month or so to focus on the better weather and the covid situation improving a bit. Enjoy yourself a little bit, see your friends if you can. But also take some time to learn... r/thetagang and r/1percentmax are two subs that I’ve learned a lot from—especially if you want theta to start working in your favor. Tastytrade videos on YouTube are great. So is kamikazekash, who goes over a lot of spreads and theta strategies. Consume all of these sources. You can learn so fucking much if you want to stick with options. You’re not gonna have explosive gains like you probably did with just calls but you can make some steady gains with options. What I’m trying to say is.. you don’t have to give up on swing trading and stick to etfs like this sub likes to advise. Maybe look into credit spreads, I like them more than debit spreads. Buy on dips, learn solid FA and TA (even tho I’d say TA is a self-fulfilling prophecy and can be leaned on too much)

132,UUU," Don’t invest in the top 5 gainers in hopes to turn a quick profit. There is often more risk than reward here, and even if you make a decent profit, you have to actually sell for profit before it quickly falls to a loss. Now, if you make a bad investment decision, don’t panic as soon as you see red. Sell if it is a small loss, but you can almost always make your money back if you hold the loss and remain patient. It could take months, but once you sell, your loss if permanent. 

The market is unreliable right now, but I am a fan of UUU. It runs consistently, but be sure to buy before it begins. Never jump into a stock you haven’t researched. If you end up losing money, you will feel far better if you are confident in the company you are investing in. Impulsive trading is gambling- period. 

Take the entire $4,000 you have left and put it in one company you trust will make you money. Ignore comment boards, and let it ride for longer than a day, week, or month. However, please don’t put any money into penny stocks, regardless of how “promising” it seems.

I am 34 years old and have learned many hard lessons in all aspects of life. I have found that bad financial decisions are much harder at the start, but there is always a solution to make things better. Mistakes in love, friendship, and career are much harder to move past than a financial loss is. Don’t beat yourself up. Some people blow thousands at strip clubs. Others have spent thousands on a car with more problems than it’s worth. People start businesses that end up failing. Or spend money on lawyers in a court case they end up losing.

135,MIT," \^ This. Statistically, you are not going to beat the market.

Even the average professionals struggle. And even the top 25 percentile of professionals struggle after fees and taxes (cause no one works for free) when investing in a risk adjusted manner. It's to the point that professionals are desperate to trade on inside information (and even that's not enough).

The average redditor to have outsized returns will need to take ridiculous levels of risks relative to the market. And when so much risk is at stake, a trade that goes 'wrong' can just empty the principal.

Learn to have better risk management. If you need the money immediately, stop speculating with it on the stock market.

Stock market has always been advised for most to be an investment tool for long term holding (in terms of decades), not weeks or a year or two. Short term money should be in safer instruments.

Risk management is a thing.

Anyways, more mature redditors here will have their 'serious money' on broad market ETFs like VTI and VXUS for equities while the single pick stocks are mostly on a 'fun money' account.

And don't buy into anyone in Youtube when it comes to stock trading. If those people were as successful as they claim, why would they need your money (e.g.: sign up to their discord community -pump and dumps-, their 'free book', their courses, etc.) instead of making billions in Wall Street.

I don't try to 'compete' against professional artists in art. So why should I feel confident enough to 'compete' against professional stock traders in Wall Street filled with Phds from Harvard, Princeton, MIT, etc.. It makes no logical sense. You are competing against math Phds from top schools willing to grind 120+ hours a week to 'beat the market' long term. In the short term, anything can happen. But do it long enough and probability will eventually work against you. Now, if you believe you are that < 10% of retail investors, then go ahead. But at least know the risk/reward ahead of time.

167,AAPL," Honestly hard to put a bead on it yet. The biggest cloud over it for me is whether bitcoins volatility is going to start to subside with institutional investors creating selling pressure on the runs and buying pressure on the dips. I think we’re starting to see a bit of that already,  not all that long ago many people thought the run was likely over once again, but then instead of the big drop, we had *tons* of support which was later revealed to be the likes of Tesla and other institutions 

So, we’re at all time highs right now. great time to IPO, maybe not the best time to buy. I do believe they’ll add more cryptos to their exchange, which will be a large increase in revenue (this is where binance has the edge currently) but ultimately bitcoin is going to be the largest contributing factor. The next bear market is going to be the most interesting to me, I’m really interested to see how it evolves with institutions involved now rather than just the emotional retail side alone we’ve had in the past. I’d love to see the next bottom be a less violent retraction with strong support from these institutions, that additional confirmation that the institutions are here to support the price would be more than enough for me to jump in. By then, market discovery takes its place, hype dies down a bit, and you can be sure you’re getting a mostly fair price with a higher ceiling to run up to. 

What I’ve learned dealing with crypto related things is it’s not so much about price as it is about the emotions surrounding the market. If no one is talking about bitcoin you can literally close your eyes and market buy and you’ll make an absolute killing. it has been a highly emotional market dominated by retail thus far. Right now everyone is extremely excited. That alone gives me pause regardless of what their financials say right now.  

To put on a bit of a tin foil hat about speculation, the biggest long term case is obviously bitcoin continuing to grow in adoption, but I’m also really interested in seeing this type of exchange done for actual securities as well. Imagine something like ERC20 tokens representing shares of AAPL I can actually take private key ownership of. damn that’d be really fucking cool. We’re talking about the ability to transact 24/7, peer to peer if desired, and in used more ways than just simple stock market exchange. A serious reduction in the fraud on our exchanges. Look at all this crypto out there that isn’t even meant to be “currency” but rather equity in some type of development platform, but people can use them as currency because of the simple utility of the technology

Of course, you’ll have other companies like TD and fidelity and Schwab doing the same thing at that point- but honestly feels like if anyone is going to front run the new age of value ownership and exchange it’s probably going to be coinbase

So in short my take is; keep an eye on it, let the market digest, see what bitcoin does next time it pulls back, then reassess.

213,PM," Hi.  Yes, in fact my thesis statement is based on the premise that Walmart currently has a majority of retail market share and is strategically placed to build on that market share via eCommerce.  There's a lot you're missing and it may be better to address it via a PM but in essence, fundamentals in market analysis refer to looking at financial statements and drawing conclusions from data such as multiples and financial ratios.  

The theory is that companies in the same industry should share similar financial metrics.  This becomes increasingly difficult in a blended market where companies such as Amazon are doing more than one thing so their multiples result in outliers from the norm.    

Maybe I can address u/7loUge and u/Stock_Resolution7866 here as well.  P/E is simply the price per share over earnings per share.  Typically, or so I was taught, a P/E under 15 is indicative of a value stock whereas a P/E greater than 15 is a growth stock.  Has Walmart ever been at a P/E of 40?  Of course not.  But then again, Walmart has never been considered an eCommerce retailer until very recently.  There's certainly a paradigm shift in HOW Walmart does things not so much what they do.  To say that 40 is not viable long-term is to also say that a P/E of 70+ for Amazon is irrational.  Whether it is or is not doesn't matter in this analysis.  The bottom line is that in a fair market, WMT is undervalued.  

Key takeaway:  Walmart doesn't have to grow their business through eCommerce (though they will) to increase their Market Cap. there are scores of ways they can do this.  One such way is if they maintain market foothold while decreasing operating costs through eCommerce.  I do not believe a P/E of 40 is irrational whatsoever.  Sometimes people look too closely at a stock and forget the only thing that matters.  Market Capitalization.  WMT is a $400B company and Amazon is at $2T (? fact chk.).  Yet Walmart has a much larger share of retail and more distribution channels.  Now obviously its much more complicated than that.

Only thing I'm bearish about WMT is the CEO. He has not so good approval rating and when I went through his track record, he is more of a broadening business type guy. But WMT should focus its efforts in efficiency now more than ever imo. WMT is losing its footprint in Asia due to high cost of operations. Also for fintech business model I went in because I thought it would give them more efficiency not because they are broadening their footprint in e-commerce.(Also that part of fintech is already populated by companies like Square and Stripe.

You can't buy bitcoin in a 401. Also, there are some ETF's that we can buy but they charge 2% or more for the privilege. I don't pay 2% without some guarantees. And, importantly, compared to my 401 my after tax account is a hobby.

Also, only a fool would not consider what happens when things go bad. Notice I said when, not if. Everything eventually goes bad. Even Bitcoin. 

So, what would happen to me if Bitcoin crashed by 50% or maybe 80% and didn't come back?

I have to assume that COIN would mitigate a crash in bitcoin. People here are saying that COIN would not do as well as bitcoin increases in value but I also thing COIN would crash less than bitcoin.

My plan is too wait for the price to stabilize before I invest. Typically the stock price is controlled by forces we barely understand after a IPO.  I'm not smart enough to play that game.

Or maybe it's time to buy Paypal. Maybe all the traders will run to one side of the boat and sell Paypal to buy COIN.

I've read many posts on this thread saying... just buy bitcoin. They have some good reasons to do so. But they don't document the downside.

You can't buy bitcoin in a 401. Also, there are some ETF's that we can buy but they charge 2% or more for the privilege. I don't pay 2% without some guarantees. And, importantly, compared to my 401 my after tax account is a hobby.

Also, only a fool would not consider what happens when things go bad. Notice I said when, not if. Everything eventually goes bad. Even Bitcoin. 

So, what would happen to me if Bitcoin crashed by 50% or maybe 80% and didn't come back?

I have to assume that COIN would mitigate a crash in bitcoin. People here are saying that COIN would not do as well as bitcoin increases in value but I also thing COIN would crash less than bitcoin. 

So, I think COIN is probably a fine investment, I have to wait until I can calculate, and find, the right price.",grizzlytalks,2,/r/stocks/comments/mr3ex1/when_i_hear_about_coinbase_being_a_bad_investment/gulh0jg/,0.084,0.807,0.109,0.6553

i dont think it makes sense to value them like tech growth company. should be valued like exhcnages (ICE NDAQ etc)

the only way it makes sense to even maintain, much less grow, is if volume goes up 50-100x

242,COIN," Excellent points!  We can also use other industries to see how they transitioned and new players were brought in:

* Western Union charges a whole lot of money to remit currencies to a different location.  It's not just the fee's, but the FOREX spread which they capture.  They are obviously high cost, but the value is also high because of the ease in which to pick up payments in thousands of locations.

* Banks and PayPal are middle of the road here.  They'll have a FOREX spread which benefits them and also charge a fee.  

* Wise (or whatever they are now) are the best in terms of fixed fees and very close to real-time XE exchange rates when doing global money transfers.  

Any of those companies (and banking institutions) can do what COIN does right now, and the fee structure will be identical to what is happening at real-time.   So COIN will need to include other services, such as portfolio or investment options.  

Retail users will go with what they know, and what is easiest.  COIN is very new and doesn't have the known branding.  Then users will want to know how much they could have made / saved and as such, shop their options.

Looking at Robinhood (RH) as an example.  People got in, but a whole lot of them transferred out to Fidelity, E*Trade and others with no consequences.  It's simply that easy in this day and age for stocks for a 3-5 day transfer to occur and all equities winding up with the new firm.",Qs9bxNKZ,1,/r/stocks/comments/mr3ex1/when_i_hear_about_coinbase_being_a_bad_investment/guk2l9a/,0.016,0.857,0.127,0.9857

* Unemployment is dropping faster than expected. [Initial jobless claims](https://www.dol.gov/ui/data.pdf) were were 576,000, the lowest in more than a year, and well below the forecast of 710,000.
* [Retail sales](https://www.census.gov/retail/marts/www/marts_current.pdf) are booming, up 9.8% compared to a forecast 6.1%.

I'm forecasting a **green day** with a NASDAQ **high of 14,102** and a **low of 13,996**. 

That would put us just a little shy of ATH at today's peak.

353,PLTR," It’s hard to explain a position like this succinctly but I’ll try (and admit I could be entirely wrong)

We are going through 3 major phases in information

1. Explosion to access to information
-Birth of World Wide Web, and cataloguing of anything and everything from junk to breakthrough science/technology 

2. Storage and mining of information
-What are are going through now. Facebook, google, Amazon, targeted ads, companies, manufacturing shipping, you name it. Getting and holding data is king.

3. Making sense of this stupid amount of information we have
-The is the thing no one really has elegantly solved yet. How do you efficiently go through all this insane amount of information easily? How many times or people do you know who work in supply chains are frustrated as shit because every single system is clunky, Frankensteined together with different systems, legacy systems etc

Palantir I think offers a real solution to 3

I work in medical and their double click demo on healthcare systems fkn tore me a new asshole. And it’s exactly what I’m saying about point 3. We have the capacity to capture so much fucken information these days but no useful way of accessing it and linking things together

Palantir is basically the abacus. It’s a tool that assists humans to improve their intelligence and output artificially.

Maybe someone who works in supply chains can chime in.

Disclosure: I hold PLTR for long

407,NIO," There is a shortage going on with NIO, and they are not producing at the level they need to be. This led to the stock dropping several percent.  It had rallied back up to about 45, and then traded sideways for a while between 40-45 when the shortage info came out, it tanked and has not recovered since.


Charts only mean so much when there is valid proof and reasoning as to why the stock is trading the way it is, as opposed to things that make no sense like Gamestop's stock.

>NIO estimated the production shutdown could reduce its first-quarter deliveries by up to 1,000 vehicles, to 19,500.

If your stock (GME) doesn't make any significant movements towards the strike, the LEAP will slowly bleed Theta over time.  While you may intend to exercise the call, if you ever need liquidity you may not be able to exit the position at a favorable valuation.

Secondly, you need to compare the extrinsic and intrinsic value of your LEAP.  GME has very high IV, so it's likely your LEAP will have a significant amount of IV priced in.

If the implied volatility of GME falls, it'll affect your LEAP as well.  As of today, it looks like the Jan2023 LEAPs (>.85 delta) are pricing GME @$200 or so.

441,GME," You will absolutely get crushed opening a leap call on GME. Volatility plays a huge role in option pricing...and has a great impact on leaps. I haven’t checked the latest volatility reading for GME but I’m fairly certain it’s still through the roof.

Look at it this way: At the money contracts in both TSLA ($723) and GME ($166) have very similar prices! There’s a $557 difference in the underlying yet contract premiums are comparable. This should be a big indicator that GME contracts are factoring in tons of volatility. 

Before opening any leaps I would suggest fully understanding the Greeks, volatility and how they impact option premium. Look into IVPercentile/IVRank as a way to determine when’s a good time to open leaps (or any option position in general)

450,AAPL," If AAPL is $132, $132.50 is OTM. It's only $0.50 but that could make a huge difference depending on DTE. If you're buying weeklies for example, and AAPL drops 2% from $132, your $132.50 will drop more. 2% will increase IV, but the loss from the movement and theta will negate the IV bump since it's so close to expiry. 35-40+ DTE, the effects will be less.

It sounds like from your comments in the thread you started with $100, made $500 on one good trade, and $400 elsewhere. That's not bad, but not enough to say your doing well either. Buying options is just gambling and one wrong move will mean large losses. If you have 5 open positions worth $100 each, you could lose 25% of your account value in an hour or 2. Spreads are better for limiting downside risk in my opinion, but are harder to understand, build, and manage effectively.

The farther OTM you go, the bigger the gamble that it will be profitable. Buying ITM options is simply using leverage to control more shares of the underlying with less capital than holding the underlying itself. Leverage can result in a 10x gain in a few days, and a wiped account as well. $1000 isn't much to worry about long term, but depending on your income it could be months before you could save that again so idk.

I'd paper trade spreads if you want to make money guessing which direction a stock will move. I traded a call debit spread on a stock I can't list here assuming, incorrectly, that it would go up with the COIN DPO. It dropped 15% in one day.

451,COIN," If AAPL is $132, $132.50 is OTM. It's only $0.50 but that could make a huge difference depending on DTE. If you're buying weeklies for example, and AAPL drops 2% from $132, your $132.50 will drop more. 2% will increase IV, but the loss from the movement and theta will negate the IV bump since it's so close to expiry. 35-40+ DTE, the effects will be less.

It sounds like from your comments in the thread you started with $100, made $500 on one good trade, and $400 elsewhere. That's not bad, but not enough to say your doing well either. Buying options is just gambling and one wrong move will mean large losses. If you have 5 open positions worth $100 each, you could lose 25% of your account value in an hour or 2. Spreads are better for limiting downside risk in my opinion, but are harder to understand, build, and manage effectively.

The farther OTM you go, the bigger the gamble that it will be profitable. Buying ITM options is simply using leverage to control more shares of the underlying with less capital than holding the underlying itself. Leverage can result in a 10x gain in a few days, and a wiped account as well. $1000 isn't much to worry about long term, but depending on your income it could be months before you could save that again so idk.

462,USA," Good question, when I was younger I considered it.

* The price of what you get.  The dividend payout is over four quarters and you've got to look at the percentage payout (annually) divided by four.  Still, not bad right?
* Selling and buying a stock becomes income.  That is not always a capital gains and will be taxed at the highest rates
* The dividend is also taxed at income

But hey, free money right?  Here's some experience:

I recently sold USA at $7.60 and it's now jumped to $8.24 today ($0.80 increase) because of the announcement of the dividend.  I bought it last year at $4.89 and had the dividends reinvested taking my share total from 2500 to about 2700.  

That 1 year growth at 2500 x $4.89 is a 55% growth.  If I focus on the dividends, it's 200 shares at $7.60, about $1550 or 8%.

If I waited from 3/31 (when I sold) to today at 4/15 (two weeks) I could have realized a larger gain, right?  $8.24 - $7.60 = $0.64 x 2500 = $1600.  

So if you look at the play above, you can still capitalize on dividends, reduce your tax liability AND have growth.  

Point is:  Don't just wait to buy it ""the day before"" but be aware that if you want, you can get the dividends AND the growth.  When you get this, then you start looking at how to maximize your income (from dividends, and then from growth) by minimizing your expenses (aka taxes).",Qs9bxNKZ,3,/r/stocks/comments/mqycyw/whats_stopping_me_from_dumping_my_life_savings/gujzzv6/,0.014,0.842,0.144,0.9867

491,USA," It's kind of normal.  The underlying assets can be ""in demand"" and the business team can be top notch.  

Like any stock with a high P/E, you may see this also reflected in the premium of a CEF.  Buy a home in a pricey zip code, you're paying a premium over the average market price.  It'll be a premium more than likely today, tomorrow and a few years down the road.

You're looking at CEFs typically because

* Dividends (probably)
* Price
* Underlying asset class (probably not)

The premium is indeed something to look at, but by that logic, we'd avoid companies that never turned a profit (high P/E) and typically choose laggards (little to no premium).  

I'd flip the above bullet points in reverse, focusing on the CEFs that are holding assets that I would want to hold, a price that is affordable (compared to the NAV) and then the dividends.

494,BSTZ," Yep, definitely going for the dividends. Part of my thesis is that tech/Nasdaq is going to see some sideways chop for the next couple of years before seeing substantial growth again, and I'm looking for a way to invest in tech while simultaneously generating some income. I'm also in QYLD for the same reason, but QYLD would limit my upside when tech does finally take off again, so I want to diversify.

523,ID," Short answer: Yes, possibly.

Long answer: VW Group sold 232k EVs in 2020, the third most of any auto manufacturer. They sold the 2nd most automobiles globally of any auto manufacturer in 2020. They're the biggest car company in Europe and in China, two quickly expanding EV markets. They have a global network of dealerships and deep pockets. The ID.4 is getting good reviews and I think it will sell well. In the long run I think they will surpass Tesla. Whether they reach 600k EV sales this year will depend on demand and production capacity. It seems to me that demand for vehicles globally is still somewhat weak but once it does recover I expect VW to become a major player in the EV market.",Endurance_Cyclist,3,/r/stocks/comments/mr5nbu/could_the_next_tesla_sell_600000_battery_electric/gukgxdx/,0.035,0.914,0.051,0.2724
