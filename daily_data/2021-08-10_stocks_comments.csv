59,JPM," That makes one of us. I actually like Crypto as a concept but I'm not foolish enough to believe it's going to last forever. Crypto has one truly marketable advantage over dollars, it's cheaper and easier to move large amounts of currency internationally. That's it, that's it's best real world function.

The fed is likely to release their own digital dollar at some point which will have the same flexibility as crypto. My guess is the biggest reason they haven't done so already is bc it competes with their biggest customers, big banks.

A fed issued digital dollar could be crippling to wells Fargo, JPM Citi ECT.... It also puts Fintech at the front of banking services.

I agree that regulation=institutional adoption and is short term bullish but control over currency is something federal governments and central banks will never relinquish and they've got the power to do as they please here. Eventually crypto as we know it is a footnote in history.

ZEV got this contract because they can electrify already-existing fleets. That means they don't have to actually make the vehicles, they just have to install the drivetrain. It's a completely different business model than trying to sell completely new vehicles.

It is actually bearish for companies that are trying to make their own electric fleet vehicles from the ground up.

This is precisely my point - but none of the companies you mention do fleet conversion. Forest River does fleet bodies. Now they'll partner with ZEV to provide electric motors. But the fleets are still Ford (or whatever) chassis.

Let's say you've already got a fleet of 10,000 Ford trucks. Each one has a custom trailer that you paid thousands of dollars per truck to develop and install for the specific needs of your company. Why would any business buy another 10,000 trucks and then pay to customize their trailers when all they need to do is swap a drivetrain? 

Especially since the electric tech is changing so rapidly. Replacing the drivetrains will give the existing fleet years more relevance and function as an effective stop gap while companies watch the tech advance.",roundupinthesky,6,/r/stocks/comments/p1uecr/zev_lightning_emotors_secures_850_million/h8g8dvj/,0.028,0.934,0.038,0.3818

2) 90% of your current tax liability by the end of the year.

278,NVDA," My advice before anything is not to make any short-term or medium-term investments. You need to be prepared for the market to crash and the market may fluctuate in the short-to-medium term. Your horizon should be at least 5 years in my opinion. 

That being said, amongst other companies like Apple, Google, Amazon and more, I‚Äôm particularly bullish on NVDA (Nvidia) in the long term. Their growth is astounding, and they‚Äôre constantly expanding into different areas of technology, one of the more notable expansions has been data centre. They make fantastic amounts of money which I only except to grow for years to come as they mature as a company. Their current market cap sits around $500B but I easily see them becoming a trillion dollar company in the next 5-10 years. 

Despite this, they‚Äôre quite expensive right now when looking at their P/E ratio, but as I‚Äôve said on another post, you‚Äôd be kicking yourself if you didn‚Äôt pick them up at the current price, which will be considered cheap in a number of years to come. 

Of course do your own research as I‚Äôve barely scratched the surface with the information that I‚Äôve provided, and there‚Äôs much more information to read about, but I‚Äôll leave that up to you. I strongly advise that you take a look at their balance sheet, read their quarterly and annual reports, look at their growth in the past 5 years. They‚Äôre a very exciting company! 

Best of luck!

So they end up in a position where all the money they spend investing in new drinks doesn't even increase their revenue, it just slows the decline. Pretty much what's been happening to them for the past decade. None of their other brands have close to the same competitive advantage Coca-Cola does, if the flagship is in trouble, I think the whole company is in trouble.

That being said, I don't think KO is necessarily a *bad* company, just for that multiple there are lots of companies with double digit revenue and profit growth who are on the right side of emerging social trends, so personally I don't see any reason to make room for it in a portfolio.",luckynumberdouble8,3,/r/stocks/comments/p1vz3i/ko_reasons_to_avoid_investing_in/h8g9dza/,0.077,0.758,0.166,0.9202

You read both of their convincing reports, but making an informed decision may be easier since the economist understands way more about the market and knows it's not just numbers.

376,ANY," >sold all shares on the same order 

Same order--different shares.

Look at each individual share. Did you sell it at a lower price than you purchased it for, and then buy it again within 30 days?

Then yes it is a wash sale.

Example: I buy a share of X (share 1) at $10. I then buy another share of X (share 2) at $20.

I then sell both shares at $15. I then buy another share at ANY price less than 30 days later ($10, $1, $1000, doesn't matter).

I have $5 in profit from Share 1 and $5 in losses from Share 2. But because I repurchased the stock within 30 days I cannot write that $5 loss off on my 2021 taxes. 

If you use a broker like Vanguard, that $5 loss will simply be ""added"" to the total cost of the security for accounting purposes, which will be reflected on the tax documents your broker will provide you during tax season.",vacchagotta_on_fire,1,/r/stocks/comments/p1ej52/wash_sale/h8d012r/,0.056,0.798,0.146,0.8481
