17,UI," Well I never said it was shitty.  I use android and not Samsung.  So depending where you look, apple and Samsung make up about 60-70% of the phones used.  Typically apple has a bit larger of that share.  The quality to the price is debatable, just as the charge holding.  Android UI is also very easy, it just takes a little adapting from iPhone usage.  I used to use iPhones but after NEEDING to upgrade every 1.5 -2 years the cost was to much.  So now I use a $300-400 android and they last about the same length or longer and have all the same features, with similar or better battery life.  Apple has a few phones but they are all very pricey, typically.  Samsung has several phones with a range of prices.  Are iPhones safer?  That is also debatable.  All iPhonss use the same iso.  Androids have several different iso versions, so to target an android you have to target that version.  To target an iPhone you just have to target that singular iso.  Now the new iPhone privacy seems like it will increase privacy but not security specifically.  Also, I may be better to use the product of the company you invest in.  But my personal opinion of the product isn't always reflective of the user base.  My investment in them reflects the companies quality not a specific product they make as the make lots of stuff.

25,DD," I'm going to add some thoughts  here, and start with saying I don't have a ton of time today, so I might not be very active here - and I don't know a solution either, so throw whatever you've got our way. 

In our mod discord I've been saying for probably two months that these DD posts are suspect as hell, they're all similar in structure and tend to be posted to every single sub that has anything to do with money.  And they never existed before the GME shit.  In a lot of ways the GME fiasco broke reddit financial subs, and they have yet to recover.  Lots of the organically good posts just stopped coming, and tons of straight garbage content has flooded every sub.    

Some of the other mods will attest that I've said several times these posts reeked of corporate shillery, but they have typically been generally not micro-caps or anything.  They're typically 800MM or so on the small end and up to 5-7B.  

So, what do we already do?  We don't publish this guideline because we want to reserve some qualitative control - but stocks under 100MM market cap are almost always removed.  Anything between 100-500 is situational, and generally pump and dumps don't happen on 500+ mil stocks so we allow that.  

I've been told there's a post on /r/superstonk that details someone being offered money to post DD on a stock.  Some jackass here actually posted DD and disclosed at the bottom that they were paid 1k to do so(obviously they were banned).  First of all, please don't believe everything you see on /r/superstonk - the sub is basically the /r/conspiracy of financial subs.  Their mods regularly push the most retarded of conspiracy theories. (Seriously - they were formed because the batshit stuff people were posting was too absurd for WSB. Someone linked a mod doing a livestream with some kid in his dorm room explaining that the DTCC was actually a ponzi scheme yesterday.  Like, what the fuck?)  That said, the idea that bad actors are looking to try and create a repeat GME situation by leveraging uninformed investors on reddit isn't a conspiracy, I see signs of that all the time.  And the DD posts are a prime example of them.  

So, we have already had a gigantic decline in quality posts after GME.  I'm not super happy about further limiting it, but I still feel like 98% of these DD posts are bad faith.

43,ABC," Also, one more quick addition, I tracked down the thread in /r/superstonk that everyone is referring to.  My BS detector went off immediately.  I think that's a fake recording.  I do think it's completely true that these DD posts are coming from bad actors, and I think there's people paying to have content put on reddit.  But come on guys, that was clearly some girl who's never had a professional phone call in her life.  I'm pretty sure some 19yo dude just recorded that with like his girlfriend or something.  A few glaring tells - because people need to be able to spot bullshit as a basic life skill.

1) ""okay ummm so essentially we are a media agency"".  She didn't drop a name, and she stumbled through the description with a ton of ""umms"" and filler words, and ""media agency"" isn't the way any firm would describe themselves.  It's PR firm, Social Media Marketing, Marketing, etc.  So right off the bat it's sus as hell.  I get calls from marketing people all the fucking time, and we hire kids right out of college to develop in to our planners over time.  That whole ""ummm, so, essentially, uhhh"" stuff gets beaten out of you less than a month in any professional job.  No marketing agency would let someone so poorly spoken helm the phones.  

You'd expect this:

> ""This is Rebecca with ABC solutions, we are a PR and marketing agency specializing in helping interested third parties generate buzz and awareness on key social media platforms for various public companies.  We are interested in exploring a partnership with you, and leveraging your position on Reddit to discuss XYZ, there is compensation involved depending on blah blah blah blah blah"" 

I spitballed that off the top of my head, and I definitely don't work in marketing.  Like, I realize much of the subscriber base here is young and not familiar with the professional world but come on, that ""call"" was glaringly unprofessional.

51,DD," I'm in favour of keeping DD posts, but think that it might be worth imposing even higher standards. 

One of my rules of considering DD posts is that it must have, or at least acknowledge, a bear case. If a poster makes a DD post with a bull case and says only good things about the stock that is an automatic red flag.  
At least if the poster is presenting a bear case too it A) Shows a slightly deeper understanding of the company and, B) forces paid shills to at least give a slightly more balanced post. We're not going to get rid of them, so we might as well force them to have some standards.

Edit: After reading some other comments, I wonder if having set criteria for a DD post might be worthwhile. My 3 must-haves would be:

* Minimum post length (at least 2-300 words) 

* Discussion of company financial (are they good/bad, is there a reason for this? How does it compare to sector etc)

* Must have a bear case, or at least discuss why there isn't one.

3. People undercounting Warner business/tv production getting back once economy reopens.

4. Netflix looking like it has less and less moat against more and more competitors that will eat away at them because they don't NEED to make money on streaming. Google doesn't NEED youtube to make money cause it has search, Amazon with prime streaming, AT&T makes money on phone/internet lines and not HBOMax, Viacom with Paramount movies, Alibaba/Tencent will fight their global expansion, Disney can keep raking in billions are merch/parks/DCUmovies, etcetc.

104,DOW," My understanding of a capital gains tax you pay based on the difference between buy and sell price.   If you've held for example stock in Apple for the last twenty years,  you have a lot of paper gains but haven't paid any tax on that gain.  If you hold,  you will have to pay the new capital gain tax on the entire gain.  If you sell now,  you owe the current lower tax.  You can take that money and buy something else like a DOW index   fund and keep some exposure to Apple for some period of time to avoid a wash sale,  then sell the fund and buy Apple again resetting the buy price for any future gain at the new tax rate.

I'm steadily averaging down and plan on getting another 2k shares should it hit \~$1.7 again. This is a stock I plan on holding for a few years, as I believe the risk to reward ratio is in my favor. Their main competitor is Dexcom, which is a $350-400 stock. They have an over the skin sensor which only lasts for 10 days. Due to share float, SENS has too many outstanding shares to ever reach Dexcom levels in my eyes, however I believe $50-100 for SENS is doable should they successfully acquire FDA approval in the USA.

They make a subdermal blood glucose monitor that can stay in place for 180 days (only available overseas at the moment). Estimated FDA approval/denial is Q3-Q4 of this year (I predict October time frame). The CEO has stated that after their first billion in profits from the CGM sensor, they plan on expanding the technology to be able to do more real time readings for things such as cholesterol levels. They're also working towards a 365 day subdermal sensor. This company COULD strongly shake the CGM market, which is expected to increase by 25% in the coming years, according to a few reports I've seen.

Their next earnings release is coming some time in June, and will reflect profits from sales of their 180 day sensor in Europe.

Edit: They have a 90 day sensor which IS available in the USA at the moment.

About the same returns, much less risk (no interest rate risk or, for bonds outside of T-Bills, bankruptcy risk), and generally more liquidity. Either way you aren't beating inflation.

If I was in my late 50's and retired, I wouldn't be 30% bonds but probably looking at laddering bonds with maturities where I need them around 3 years out. That makes sense, because I will require certain sums of money at certain points that I already know.

* How old are you? What country do you live in?
* 40+, USA
* Are you employed/making income? How much?
* Semi retired, I am trying to plan out an investment vehicle before going back to work so I have more peace of mind.
* What are your objectives with this money? (Buy a house? Retirement savings?)
* Grow it as much as possible while preserving capital.
* What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs?
* I don't need the money but I am trying to protect it against inflation etc.
* What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know its 100% safe?)
* I have a lot of risk tolerance but prefer stability.
* What are you current holdings? (Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors? Any other assets?)
* 323k in a professionally managed 401k that I never touch.  It does pretty well so I have something to compare against.
* Any big debts (include interest rate) or expenses?
* I am totally debt free. Expenses need not factor into any suggestions as I cover them outside of this fund.
* This is a 50k fund.

Here's the plan, I'm basing it around sort of a swing/defensive idea.  That being if fiat currency overinflates or the dollar crashes, I'm at least a little stabilized in gold and maybe silver.  If the stocks crash hard, same thing and I keep a cash position to repair those investments/buy undervalued stuff.

I intend to keep 10 percent in speculative things: Motley Fool picks, FAANG if they ever look undervalued, maybe straight up day trading.  Never more than 1-2% in these.  I'll probably end up with 5 motley fool picks over time and discard underperformers.  This is where I'll sell a little to rebalance hopefully if everything else retains value in the attempts to construct a wealth generating vehicle that preserves itself by eventually winding any profit into the more stable areas.

I like SCHD, SPYD because they seem to be based on the most stable parts of two major indexes due to preselection for dividends with no overlap so my diversification is covered.   PHYS and PSLV are the next best thing to holding real metals it seems.  This is the part I'm most unsure of due to silver price manipulations in the past, I'm not sure of a good ratio to keep in these, or at all.  I'm somewhat sold on the bull case for silver speculation lately, but I worry about gov't repeat of what happened with the Hunt brothers, or other government seizure (Sprott's Canadian vault).   

I have no experience with bonds but I know they're terrible right now so I'm hoping to use PMs and these seeming tanks of ETFs to stabilize the portfolio in place of them.  I'd also consider a solid single stock like T in here maybe, but I am already invested in T in my back end 401k.

I'm new to serious investing for myself, and a lot of my research centers around what didn't lose value in the March 23, 2020 crash, or snapped back very fast.

I'm mostly waiting for a serious downturn to even buy in because everything seems massively overvalued to me right now, which is a large part of the reason for the more cash and PMs idea.  I also like the idea of having my own cash backed by ""my own PMs"" (except they're really just shares in a joint speculation in a trust because I can't practically come up with enough capital to take a massive delivery from Sprott)

Anyway please share any thoughts or suggestions.

149,DD," You've come to the wrong place for harsh criticism I think (or hope).

My overarching philosophy is run with the bull while the bull is running...  And be able to spot real bear markets.  we haven't had a real bear market since 2008-9 so it will hurt when it shows up.  that said real bear markets take a LONG time to resolve, if you can spot them three months in you are way ahead of the game, because the worst pain of the bear comes in its final third part of dropping, which can easily be 7-12 months in.

changing allocation in that 401k you mentioned could have more impact on your total return than a lot of other steps you can take.

In the mean time, if it ain't a bear, it's a bull.  Invest in it.  Better to have the gains to lose than have money on the sidelines doing nothing but deflating.  What if there is no bear for another 2-3 years?  final thirds of bull markets are also where disproportionate gains can occur.  What's funny is at the end of the bull cycle you will have a hard time finding a person with a worried outlook ... people will be rationalizing the new normal and Grandma will be giving you investment advice.  we aren't there yet.

Also, Silver and Gold don't correlate as an inflation or crash hedge the way people seem to think.  They are cyclical commodities so I don't have a lot of belief in them myself.  and like you pointed out, they have been manipulated.  oh yeah, and people are still digging them out of the ground... supply/demand if prices go up more mining happens.  Don't just believe what the gold and silver people say, take a close look at the history.  Ever since the buck was decoupled from silver and gold there hasn't been a lot of reason for it to be valuable in a crash.  This is my opinion, do your own DD.  I think you are already finding some of it.

You are right about bonds.  People just lump them in to the financial plan without a lot of critical thinking.  When the signs all say interest rates will be higher in the next 1-3-10 years, they will lose money which makes them worse than a drag on the portfolio.  Not all classes of bonds move exactly the same way, so I know I am making a blanket statement.

So I need to buy it may 2nd to get the dividend, on may 2nd it will trade at $100, however open on may 3rd it will trade at $99 dollars (all other things being equal there may be other UN-related movement) so now I could sell it may 3rd for a $1 loss...but then get a $1 dividend in return and equal out.",SirGlass,2,/r/investing/comments/mw0n7w/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gvfw3r2/,0.02,0.937,0.043,0.3612
