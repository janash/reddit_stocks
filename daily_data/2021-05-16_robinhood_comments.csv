0,GOOG, srsly tho why is GOOG doing so well?,ilostmyfirstuser,7,/r/RobinHood/comments/ndc42a/faang_stock_performance_2021/gyarc2u/,0.0,0.719,0.281,0.4101
1,FANG," FANG initially stood for just the consumer internet companies: Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google. 

Apple got added somehow because it was easy to do so amidst the other ‘A’. However both Apple and Microsoft are not really consumer internet companies. For eg Apple primarily sells hardware and bundled software, msft used to sell bundled software like windows, office. Now they have moved to cloud based applications but they are still a lot more heavier on enterprise side and not really consumer",pranavr93,3,/r/RobinHood/comments/ndc42a/faang_stock_performance_2021/gyb2ms2/,0.0,0.938,0.062,0.4678
2,IBM," Company style. Microsoft is more of an older fashioned company than these others. I’d compare it to IBM. They are more of a conglomerate of different things too, not that the others don’t have multiple revenue streams but most of them do one thing. Apple does phones/computers, Google does search engines, Netflix does streaming, Amazon sells stuff online, Facebook collects data from old people.",Match_MC,10,/r/RobinHood/comments/ndc42a/faang_stock_performance_2021/gyabh8f/,0.0,0.968,0.032,0.2617
3,MSFT," Microsoft as an old company hasn't seen as explosive a stock growth until at least 2016. If you held MSFT from 1999 to 2016, you could have seen 0 gain.",oryiesis,1,/r/RobinHood/comments/ndc42a/faang_stock_performance_2021/gyb44sd/,0.0,0.812,0.188,0.7184

5,AI," Not super surprising actually - they completely dominate in so many areas: search, advertising, browsers, email, maps, video streaming, AI and more. Not to mention that their cloud services area is hugely growing too.

It's basically impossible to go online without touching some Google property, and since the pandemic many people are increasingly living their lives online.",eliasbagley,1,/r/RobinHood/comments/ndc42a/faang_stock_performance_2021/gyd1u7x/,0.111,0.856,0.033,-0.5803
6,TV," Microsoft is definitely more diversified , but Apple is getting up there. 
Their Watch and AirPods business would be a huge company even on its own. 
Same with the App Store and iCloud. 

People like to say Apple is too reliant on iPhone but they have done a remarkable job of not just continually growing iPhone revenue from its already astronomical levels, but growing existing lines and creating new ones. 

Almost everything Apple touches becomes a cash cow. I say almost because there have been some recent failures (HomePod ... Apple TV has been slow to grow too ).",trpkchkn,3,/r/RobinHood/comments/ndc42a/faang_stock_performance_2021/gybfjil/,0.069,0.772,0.159,0.8734
7,IBM," MSFT culture is def not comparable to IBM. Ballmer era was more IBM.

Satya Nadella took over and broke the culture issues that plagued MSFT. It’s actually a place people are proud to work and it’s a top place to work again. 

Innovation is happening again and AZURE will eclipse AWS.",Pdicky69,4,/r/RobinHood/comments/ndc42a/faang_stock_performance_2021/gyal2qc/,0.051,0.814,0.136,0.5719

9,COST," It’s not timing the market. It’s time IN the market. Buy a solid, diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds. Seek dividend paying stocks and those with strong balance sheets. Dollar cost averaging is your friend. If your risk tolerance is high, own mostly stocks and few bonds, if your risk tolerance is low or you are retiring soon, more bonds. Try to stick with stocks you are familiar with. Start with businesses you know and love yourself. I am a consumer of almost all the stocks I own. I like the following:
