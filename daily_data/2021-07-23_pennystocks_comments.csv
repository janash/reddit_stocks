71,GS," Custodianships and the upcoming restrictions.

This is how I understand it. Please correct me if any of this info is wrong. The big players in custodianships, GS, SSM, Alpha, **ETC** need to own a significant amount of shares to apply for custodianship of a defunct ticker. Will they be able to buy these shares after the new restrictions take place?  If not, or if its a huge hassle, they should be accumulating now. It appears that AlphaRidge is doing just that with their custodianship applications.

For those that like to gamble, AND have patience, wouldn't these next few weeks be a good time to buy as many as possible? And hold them in hopes of becoming current in the near future?  Like several small positions of $100 or so to kind of diversify.  Some wont make it current, but if half or more of them do, gains could be huge.

140,CEMI," yes and no. I am still learning. And I'm lucky(and unlucky)  that I have a propensity for not selling at a loss. CEMI, for example, I was WAY down on and it went back up and I was able to make a profit. I'm hoping I don't have to baghold XELA, IGC, and CRTD too long. 

I also know there will be losses, but in terms of penny stocks I made the mistake in the beginning (months and months ago where I bought maybe $40 worth and am now down 90%) of getting in and out quickly. 

The problem with the market right now is I don't think it's tied much to fundamentals or technical analysis (though I am very slowly reading about those.) I think there's a chaotic FOMO psychology that can be read and used to quickly ride a high and then sell. 


My problem was that I rebought XELA after selling for a profit (and two days of it being hot) and that I averaged down on IGC but even though I significantly averaged down, there's been a whole bigger dip so I'm sitting at 3.36 average on that. If I had used that money for any of the other stuff I was looking at (SPRT among them) I would have at least had some money making capability on the side while waiting for these three to do something.

142,IGC," yes and no. I am still learning. And I'm lucky(and unlucky)  that I have a propensity for not selling at a loss. CEMI, for example, I was WAY down on and it went back up and I was able to make a profit. I'm hoping I don't have to baghold XELA, IGC, and CRTD too long. 

I also know there will be losses, but in terms of penny stocks I made the mistake in the beginning (months and months ago where I bought maybe $40 worth and am now down 90%) of getting in and out quickly. 

The problem with the market right now is I don't think it's tied much to fundamentals or technical analysis (though I am very slowly reading about those.) I think there's a chaotic FOMO psychology that can be read and used to quickly ride a high and then sell. 


My problem was that I rebought XELA after selling for a profit (and two days of it being hot) and that I averaged down on IGC but even though I significantly averaged down, there's been a whole bigger dip so I'm sitting at 3.36 average on that.

160,COO," Also consider that this product has been used on the market by numerous surgeons under enforcement discretion by FDA and the safety profile as well as it’s indications and instruction for use are well developed and understood. Also go to clinical trials dot gov and review the results of their 100 person DFU study that compared this biological product to the current (SOC) standard of care for DFU.
It’s not just the FDA approval from CBER. It’s what happens when this is the standard of care to treat DFU better and cheaper than the current standard of care. 

Richard Hague, President & COO, commented, “Our team firmly believes that a successful BLA for SkinTE will create a highly valuable asset based on the clinical data that will support our eventual BLA submission, which should drive widespread adoption, enable favorable payer coverage and clear marketing claims, and provide regulatory exclusivity if SkinTE is deemed a reference product. With over 1,200 clinical uses of SkinTE to date and many positive outcomes, we look forward to submitting an IND and commencing the clinical trials that will support our BLA, so that many more patients can benefit from treatment with SkinTE.”",ipostsomethingtoday,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/oq836o/pte_is_recovering_to_50_dma_and_expecting_ind/h6a41je/,0.0,0.759,0.241,0.9944

This means that you have no clue how to properly value a company and thus you don't even know if xiaomi is actually super overvalued or not. If its overvalued it will fall like a brick with a correction or a market crash or if blacklisting talks or something similar happens again.
