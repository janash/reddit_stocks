Was hoping someone could tell me why the chart on EToro for Rolls Royce (RR.L) is different to one shown on LSE when I look back at them. For instance if I look at the EToro chart in 2019 its moving between around 700 - 950, but on the LSE chart its much lower, around the 300 mark all year.

They seem to have the same current price and both are in GBX, but I feel like maybe the EToro one is a different instrument or something, but it is hard to tell.

12,GME," I don't think this has much to do with GME. Hedges don't want to get wrecked on shorts because they see the bull case as incredibly strong. And I have a hard time blaming them. Rip roaring economy, government payouts that are going into debt and savings (i.e. equities) combined with still-low interest rates. 

Hard to see the bear case right now -- and there is wisdom in saying that that means it's exactly the time to be wary, but sometimes a spade is just a spade, too.

76,GME," This isn‚Äôt as true as people think. 

I operated on this belief for most of my trading life. In fact, i assume worse than this. That the news is often manipulative when it comes from the industry players and fake when it‚Äôs from news outlets just trying to get clicks with hysteria. 

 >>‚ÄùGell-Mann amnesia 

>>Michael Crichton coined the term Gell-Mann Amnesia effect to describe forgetting how unreliable a source is in one area when you trust it in another area.‚Äù

Meaning if you see a topic you know about, you will always see how the news gets the story wrong most of the time. But you assume it‚Äôs a fluke and they get it right on other topics.

So I‚Äôm fully indoctrinated ok? That said, there are academic studies that have disproved this. All news helps stocks prices. And the market actually doesn‚Äôt react as fast as we cynically expect. And this was before the acceleration of the domination of momentum and meme stocks. 

What we experience is impatience. Retail traders do buy at the near term peak and get front run on. But if they held past the next dip they would STILL out perform over the medium and long term! AND you can front run casual retail traders still by buying premarket and at open. So it‚Äôs really only on the horizon of news cycle discussion that they underperform. ie boomers are only down when it‚Äôs topical, and up over short, medium AND long term.

There was a post yesterday someone showed even Jim Cramer who we always bust on, has been killing it with picks over the same timeframes I‚Äôm describing. But we just laugh at the boomers buying the nearest peak and selling the nearest bottom. But the HODL boomers actually are crushing it. 

This has become more and more true now that retail traders are pushing momentum stocks for so long now.  This will likely revert soon, but trying to pick that top will drive you crazy and may break you. (Ask me how I know) 

Furthermore, on major bad news the market and algorithms don‚Äôt even know what to do for black swans. So if you think things through, there is often opportunities.

We knew there was a pandemic for weeks before the market reacted. The few biggest events of the year are like this.

I‚Äôm personally 75% Microsoft, Amazon, Google, FB. Around 20% in Baillie Gifford SMT (high growth fund) and 5% in Fubo cause, why not? 
Fubo is taking a beating but the rest are just fine. Why? Because they all make cash dollar. Interest rates go up? Who cares Microsoft and the like have billions to play with. Past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future returns. However, having a fat balance sheet helps. High interest rates? Who cares. 
Also, if you have half a brain you know that through some mechanism or another these companies will continue to grow. A world without Amazon, Microsoft or Google?

126,TV," The graph of the market for the last 100 years means little, to nothing, in terms of what they market will do in the next 6 months or 1 year.

Sure, maybe it all goes tits up next week, and you look like a genius buying that dip. On the other hand, maybe the market rallies for the next 6 months and you miss out on a 10% gain. And, then, maybe it dips after that, and you buy in, and then it falls even more!

Bottom-line is, if you are trying to time the market, you are going to have a bad time. If you are listening to the 'tone' of the talking heads on TV to gauge the upcoming performance of the market, you then, apparently, believe the talking heads can predict the market. If they could do this, they wouldn't be talking on TV, they'd be chillin' on the beach with their millions of dollars.

139,NIO," The EV sector grew unreasonably in 2020 due to FOMO brewing from Tesla's fantastic year. At the heart of NIO's operations is a good idea, but the stock has priced in the sale of millions of cars.  
  
In addition, every car they produce and sell--they sell at a loss. So for Fiscal 2020, NIO had revenues of $780 million with costs to achieve such a figure of over $800 million. This tells us that each car's cost to produce is greater than their selling price. This loss is before any overhead such as SG&A nor R&D.  
  
I personally believe NIO's FV is closer to $20-25 per share (Market cap of $25-30 billion)  
   
Should NIO be worth $15 billion more than Ford? I don't see it personally and I believe Ford is better positioned to be the affordable EV maker in the future.",EnronWorldComLehman,12,/r/stocks/comments/musi47/have_i_been_the_only_one_with_my_portfolio_value/gv8erxx/,0.039,0.851,0.11,0.8625

149,DD," 1. Hubris - We can know that 95% of traders don‚Äôt beat the market, but we believe ourselves to be the exception. This isn‚Äôt necessarily a bad thing. Hubris is just a more negative word for confidence. 

2. Trying to beat the market and failing is how we learn. We may never in our lifetimes learn how to beat the market but learning anything over the course of your life is a good thing.

3. This one is counterintuitive, but as with everything else in life, making the most amount of money possible isn‚Äôt always the goal. If it were, we‚Äôd all be trying to become doctors, lawyers, or investment bankers. Yet we choose to go into careers that interest us. Investing is much the same, there are a lot of factors that impact how we invest that have less to do with returns and more to do with emotion, and that‚Äôs fine. Some people invest ethically, some invest in companies that they already support.

161,ALL," I think 95% of DAY TRADERS don't beat the market. That is, people who open and close trades on the same day.

It's mathematically impossible for 95% of ALL investors to underperform the market, since the average investor (the 50th percentile) would perform at whatever the market is. The market is made up of individuals and institutions that are trading and investing, so most folks should end up around whatever the market performance is.",banananailgun,1,/r/stocks/comments/muwhxe/if_95_of_traders_dont_beat_the_market_why_are_so/gv918gh/,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
162,JP," > If the 95% stat is true, why does day trading exist?


Why does the lottery exist? Why do slot machines exist? Why do casinos exist? Some people do it for fun. Most people try it to get rich quick. Everyone thinks they‚Äôre special. 


As for day trading I think the number is 85% lose money, 10% break even, 4% make a profit and 1% beat index funds. And 0.00001% of day traders make more than minimum wage. 


It‚Äôs hard to gather data on day trading because:


1) People cannot accurately calculate their returns. There was a study done on Brazilian day traders and they found on a survey that 85% of them claimed to beat the market, turns out that number was closer to 3% when they analyzed their trades. 


2) The market doesn‚Äôt do the same thing each year. It‚Äôs far easier to be profitable when the market goes +42% in a year compared to -30%. This leads to discrepancies in the data just due to the market. This is where the 1% statistic comes from, 1% of day traders are able to predictable make profits every year regardless of market conditions. 


As for investors (there‚Äôs a difference). JP Morgan did a study and found the average investor from 1999-2018 had an annual return of 1.9%, while the S&P500 had an annual return of 5%. They believe this is due to investors panic selling during crashes and bear markets causing them to lose time in the market and thus hurting their returns.",The_Texidian,14,/r/stocks/comments/muwhxe/if_95_of_traders_dont_beat_the_market_why_are_so/gv8ewht/,0.047,0.843,0.11,0.945

170,JP," I agree with your fundamental point on the difference between traders and investors, although I think there are a lot more good traders than you come up with.

And clearly, JP Morgan who wants to sell advisory services, wasn't sponsoring a self serving study then and cherry picking the start to be the worst time period to measure for a lot of individual investors since the bubble was so big,and '18 was one of the few down years in the most recent 10 ... highest possible starting peak, worst possible ending point.  I wonder what average investment advisor returns looked like during that period.  Wouldn't surprise me that they underperformed the S&P also.  Probably to the same tune that individual averages did.

Since the final third of the bear typically produces 2/3 of the losses, panicking at the wrong time and/or not returning to the market will have a huge effect on investment returns.

As for investors as a pool, there are self directed and there are those that use advisors but probably still get classified... hilariously almost every investment advisor sells services that are guaranteed to underperform the market.  Admittedly, there are some time of life reasons to accept underperformance in exchange for income, and Just using a fund strategy that matches the world market will guarantee slight underperformance because of friction.  However it is also pretty easy to beat the market if you just overweight a couple of the right sectors.  That's simple and doesn't require a lot of stock research.

I think we can be optimists about this.  cheers.",LiqCourage,1,/r/stocks/comments/muwhxe/if_95_of_traders_dont_beat_the_market_why_are_so/gv91tv4/,0.056,0.828,0.116,0.9506
171,AMZN," To me, buying **profitable** green energy stocks (not smoke and mirror growth stocks) today is about as obvious a pick as buying tech stocks in 2015. Sure, it's reductive to say how easy it would've been to buy X in year Y, but sometimes future growth is quite predictable.

For example, the advent and acceleration of cloud computing in the mid/late 2000s and 2010s wasn't exactly a secret, and anyone who knew the players would have known that AWS, Azure and GCP would be enormous cash cows for their respective parent companies -> buy AMZN, MSFT, GOOG.

178,MSFT," That‚Äôs fine. Sorry if I came across as aggressive - you‚Äôd be surprised how many people tout their experience as reason to follow their advice, online or in person. I‚Äôm not an expert either but I‚Äôm a firm believer in the research Fama and French put together to explore the underlying factors that explain returns. I‚Äôm surprised you haven‚Äôt heard of them considering modern investment theory is largely predicated on their groundbreaking work. Fama french three factor model is often brought up alongside CAPM in finance classes at university. They‚Äôve since moved to FF 5 Factor which I suggest you look into. 

Again, my recap is that business growth doesn‚Äôt mean share price growth. Microsoft didn‚Äôt do anything until 2016-2017 as far as ATH‚Äôs since 2000. Cisco has never reached their ATH again even though their business has improved dramatically.

271,ATH," **Daily Stock Market Forecast**

Today is going to be a **red day** with a NASDAQ **high of 13,915** and a **low of 13,843**, with the market ~~**closing higher than it opened.**~~

I don't think today will be *too* bad -- but I do think we're going into a downswing.

Bear with me on this one. It's really long.

**Why was yesterday so red?**

On Saturday, a new SEC Chairman was [sworn in](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-17/biden-pick-gary-gensler-is-sworn-in-as-sec-chairman), and he has promised to be [tough on companies](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-candidate-for-sec-chairman-is-expected-to-be-tough-on-companies-11611743403).

Saturday night after midnight, some Redditors noticed that the lights for the executives floors of banks, market makers, and major finance lawyers were lit up all night long and that Google data on their phones showed they were extremely active. The subreddit that discovered this is full of crazy people, but, this time, it [checks out](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mtgr19/a_breakdown_of_citadels_overnight_activity/).

Monday morning, futures were blood red and, throughout the day, the market kept plummeting.

That's what I know for sure. I *assume* that these three dots connect and that finance companies are freaked out that the new SEC Chairman is actually going to do something. Either way, they're selling off hard.

**Why won't the red stop?**

Technical analysis swings the market. There are analysts at every investment company, and so if something *looks* bearish on a chart, it will *become* bearish in reality.

Last week, we were on an escalator to the moon. Yesterday, we fell off. [Here's a picture](https://i.redd.it/3u41lenp35u61.jpg) from the NASDAQ daily chart.

That firmly cemented Friday's high as a resistance line, which means that people using technical analysis are likely going to wait for the market to hit support before they start buying again. Those support lines [look like this](https://i.redd.it/vxyjkx3pk5u61.jpg).

Today, we should get a brief respite as we hit a support line at QQQ's previous ATH close of $336.45, but I don't think that'll hold as the week goes on.

**How bad could this get?**

It should be fine.

*Most likely,* this is just going to be a minor delay in momentum and we'll bounce back when we hit support. The market is bullish and all news is great, so even though we're going into a few red days, this won't even register as a drawback.

The only thing that worries me is the small cap companies. The Russell looks like it's getting ready to make a [head and shoulders](https://i.redd.it/mt6nircwg5u61.jpg), which will be a major sell sign for people who use technical analysis.

That won't just affect small caps. If the Russell crashes, the market will go with it. In 2007, right before the crash, there was a major correction. The NASDAQ appeared to get out of it -- but anyone watching the Russell would have seen that [it wasn't over](https://i.redd.it/g29mccosg5u61.jpg) and that a bigger crash was coming.

Ok, that's an extreme example. I'm not saying this is 2007. I'm just saying that the Russell is a better indicator for whether or not a correction is over than the major indexes. Here's [a picture](https://i.redd.it/akd4iqraj5u61.jpg) of the NASDAQ and Russell during a minor correction in 2018. We're probably going into something a bit more like that.

It's even more likely that we're in the clear. As long as market news remains bullish, we should see nothing worse than normal market fluctuations.

But watch for bad market data.

On your bull case, you should add military reactors.   The US submarine fleet is old and is retiring faster than new ones are being built right now.   That will change since the SSBNs can't extend their service live too much longer and the Fast Attack submarines are very important to any potential conflict between the US and China.   Remember,  submarines don't get re-fuled so retiring them doesn't lower demand and the new ones get 30 years of fuel.

What's missing is a country like Japan with some behemoth battery manufacturers like Panasonic and NGK. Sure, ""clean"" isn't a buzzword in those companies' sectors but they are vital players in the sector.

It's a confusing story with companies like Plug and Ballard power. Hydrogen? Fuel cells? the EV market is exploding and these companies are harping on about tech with a questionable future at best.

403,CPA," Firstly, congratulations for taking this step at a very young age! You must definitely be proud of this decision you made.
Secondly, and most importantly, forget about this flawed explanation you‚Äôve heard almost every amateur tell others ‚Äúwhen you‚Äôre young be aggressive‚Äù or ‚Äúput money into stocks you‚Äôre willing to lose‚Äù. That is one of the most popular lies people tell each other rather than admit they don‚Äôt know what they are doing. 
I mean why would you invest when your goal is to grow your money, but you hear others ‚Äúadvice‚Äù you there is always the risk you might lose it all üôÑ That is not investing at all. 
There is a book by the legendary Jack C. Bogle called ‚ÄúThe Little book on Common Sense Investing‚Äù. I want you to find the strength and the discipline to study that book, not just read it for the sake of telling others you read it. That book will open your eyes to the foolishness of majority of the market participants, and save you from making the mistakes most of us make. 
You‚Äôve taken the step in the right direction at such a young age, sir. Don‚Äôt make mistakes listening to unprofessional advice. Every, and I mean every single successful investor will tell you, their success was not because they picked winning stocks or they discovered some magical formula. Their success was simply because they made very few mistakes throughout their investment lifetime and grew their wealth over time. 

Good luck to you!

404,ALOT," Not sure what your entry point is in terms of $, but as an 18 year old, your life is lightspeed right now and you really need to enjoy the moments. Not saying that this shouldn't become a prime hobby or even a ""career"", but I'd honestly put my money in a managed brokerage account. Yes, you pay a small management fee off the top, but they'll set you up with a diversified portfolio based off your risk tolerance levels. As an 18 year old, basics say to be aggressive because you have ALOT of time left on the game clock. But I'd honestly let a firm manage 80% of your account, And you keep 20% to learn on your own. And then, given enough time and experience, you might feel comfortable to take the reins entirely.

My biggest mistake was keeping cash in a checking account in my early 20s, because I was too afraid and incompetent on what to do with it. Put it into a managed account to let it start working for you, while you keep a small sliver of it to ""live and learn"" with.

Just my two cents. You'll get full exposure (large, mid, small cap, US based, internatoinal, value, growth, and even some bond exposure too). That's where you want to start building that massive nest...and at 18, you're doing it which is so important for long term wealth management.

Think of it as that. Wealth management (even if you don't think it's ""wealth""). You need to think long term. Let someone manage it for a few years while you day/week trade on the side a bit. Don't ""live and learn"" with all of it. You can live and learn with just 20% and then put the remaining 80% into a managed account (and watch how they manage it...you'll learn alot from just watching your own managed account and the decisions those algorithms make).

I'm in my mid 30s, kids, house, cars, etc...the whole ""upper"" middle class shebang. And, like I said, I didn't start investing until around 25. But through ""dollar cost averaging"" (learn this term) through monthly contributions to my managed account, I'm seeing 6 figures of literally just ""play"" money. It's not retirement (which I also have in the form of both a Roth and 401k), and it's not a rainy day fund (which I've built and stashed in a money market account). It is literally my ""wealth"" management account that my wife and I don't have earmarked for anything in particular. Our monthly cash flow covers all expenses and we make contributions to all our accounts without fault.

We still don't have a plan for the account, but it really is just there to build long term wealth, and we will continue to DCA the account, through the highest of highs and the lowest of lows. Our retirement accounts should see us be millionaires at retirement, while this managed account should see us be multi-millionaires by retirement. We still have about 30 years of employment left, so plenty of time to go through crashes/bears and bulls. But the important aspect to wealth growth is stable cash flow (employment and budgeting) and monthly contribution to retirement and investment accounts (DCA).

480,ATH," > Currently i'm considering: ARKG 


Why ARKG? Why do you think genomics would be a good long term hold? Can you explain genomic technology to a toddler before they get bored? What is your current position on the ethical debate around such technology? Where is it in the process of getting development/approval? How do you think people will respond to a class issue regarding this new treatment? Keep in mind actively managed funds tend to do worse than an index fund over the long run. 


> ARKK 


Why ARKK? Historically actively managed funds to worse than an index fund over the long term. If I remember right Cathie has had this fund more than 12x in size, it‚Äôs harder to manage more money. Also why do you think investing in unprofitable ‚Äúinnovation‚Äù is a good strategy? Every time there‚Äôs innovation, it‚Äôs followed by a boom and bust, do you think Cathie will be able to time the market and get out before busts? Are you willing to pay 0.75% for potential years of bad results? 


> ICLN 


Growth is more than priced into ICLN, even after its now down 30% from its ATH. Now it‚Äôs faced with multiple issues as people bail out of this ETF. One of which is that the green energy utility companies have very high costs and thrive by taking out loans, so they don‚Äôt really have bubble potential outside of narrative driven rallies. Not to mention most of their holdings are still ridiculously overvalued so they‚Äôd need to see extreme growth if you want to see any type of returns. 


https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&q=ICLN,ARKK



You can also see how ICLN/ARKK have exploded in popularity due to their returns, while before March 2020 they had no interest.

It's ""tarot"" for a lot of people because it's not easy or quick (so it gets written of as ""voodoo crap"" because, simply, almost no one takes the time or dedication necessary to learn how to train and refine their TA skills enough to actually get good at it). I had to pour tons of hours and time into practicing, learning more, and practicing more -- especially in the worst market days (that last part is super important so you can trade well in both a bull and bear market).

I also agree though that simulations are crap, but because they never actually simulate how low volume stocks are manipulated, and how your trades will literally move against you *because* you put them up on the tape for other traders to read. I ran a simulation and turned 100k into over 1.5 million in a day because I just yoloed the entire 100k into a running low-float stock. But in reality?

Runs don't mature when you pump the price like that because honestly, if most people saw the price jump 10-20% because of a single, massive whale purchase, who *wouldn't* take profits?

My personal advice - since it's a no-risk simulation, if you want to just win (and don't care about learning about how to actually trade well), throw 50-100% into low-float momentum plays (best if under $15ish to maximize % gain) and let them ride for ~10-15 minutes up past your average before hoping out and onto a different low-float runner while the one you left cools off.",ckam87,1,/r/stocks/comments/mulxjs/trading_4_weeks/gv92kzx/,0.095,0.792,0.113,0.7599

and who cares who owns MF? considering the advice they offer is the most basic, vanilla advice ever, there's hardly room for some grand conspiracy that they're tricking masses into making poor investments. they're basically like preschool for new investors, planting the most basic seeds of investment principles. i can totally understand why someone wouldn't think it's worth it, but the whole outraged anti-Motley rabble is silly. i followed their advice and made good money, so it was worth the few bucks i paid for it.",codebcode,-2,/r/stocks/comments/mun40r/did_motley_fool_beat_you_as_a_child/gv6rs3p/,0.085,0.752,0.163,0.931
