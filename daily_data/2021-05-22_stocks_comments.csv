25,IMO," I totally agree with your ”bullish” points. However I believe Amazon currently deserves a much higher P/E because of how their profit will increase in the years to come. They are still investing extremely much, a small amount of revenue is currently profit. Amazons P/E could therefore decrease substancially because of profit explosion during the years to come. Alibaba is already extremely profitable, hard to increase the percent of revenue that goes to profit. But Alibaba is at a forward P/E around 20 I think, so they don’t need to be more profitable to be a extremely good stock. They are growing extremely much so if they just maintain there profit margin, their P/E is what it should be years ahead, so if they grow revenues like 25% per year their stock should grow similar IMO.",MonkeyBusinessssss,2,/r/stocks/comments/niiukt/baba_is_now_a_value_stock_with_50_upside_time_to/gz3dr91/,0.016,0.756,0.228,0.9814

51,BABA," You're absolutely correct. However, from a personnal point, as a very very small shareholder of the total market cap of BABA, I don't really mind that much having no voting rights (and as long as the CCP is in power, I don't expect foreign investors to be able to take managerial decisions for a while). 

As for BABA going belly up, it is of course an additional risk, but we're talking about Alibaba here. I doubt very much that BABA would go bankrupt, especially with their market strength/position. 

Finally, the political risk. This one has been around literally since BABA first listed on NYSE. While this one definitely is the biggest risk as a foreign investor, I'm confident that a 500B market cap company **won't** get delisted from an American Exchange as it brings in way too many liquidity. They'll always come to an agreement. And for the anti-monopolistic violations, it's already in the past. Although it might occur again, I seriously doubt it would affect BABA in any significant way. 

At these extremely low prices, I'm very willing to bear those risks, especially since they are in part superficial and exaggerated.",Uncle_Pennywise,26,/r/stocks/comments/niiukt/baba_is_now_a_value_stock_with_50_upside_time_to/gz23syn/,0.157,0.776,0.067,-0.9476

Remember that reddit is mostly comprised of Americans. Im not saying all Americans are dumb or anything but; there is a huge amount of fear mongering in the US. 
A lot of people just hear mainstream media talk about potential outcomes of US-China conflicts and truly believe in those outcomes.
Whereas big money is seeing through it because they know the actual details of the inner conflicts.

1. Do you guys really think, that the big energy players will sit and watch the game from the sideline? And yes, hydrogen is a loooong term solution, which will be profitable from 2030 on... Why? Because whole fkn Europe is supposed to get CO2 neutral by 2050 and the Nordic countries in Europe are constantly building their hydrogen infrastructure, to be the supplier for core countries like Germany and France. 

2. Hydrogen will eventually be profitable, our oil and gas infrastructure took trillions to build up and it would be great if we could use parts of it in future too. Ohh and btw, to all ppl who say that hydrogen is to expensive, yes, you're right, but look at the development in PV  and onshore wind market, it's now not only competitive to fossil fuels, but is outcompeting them. 
Ten years ago, nobody would have believe in that.

Hydrogen fuel cell manufacturers are a bit of a lottery ticket. I'm heavily invested in APD because they produce the hydrogen that will be bought, alongside plenty of other industrial gases, all of which I see a bullish future on. The historical arguement against hydrogen is that its inefficient to produce, but that's green/grey hydrogen. Blue hydrogen is what I love, not green hydrogen, and APD are making the move to that. Although I would love to see a move to green hydrogen in the future, Blue hydrogen is far more efficient, with essentially no pollution.

just FYI you don't need tons of high tech gizmos to be a good investor. the hedge fund manager Seth Klarman, a widely respected value investor, doesn't use a Bloomberg Terminal at his desk. he's a long-term investor, mostly uninterested in by-the-minute data. Will Danoff at Fidelity manages of one of their flagship funds (FCNTX) and he's also old-school, wth tons of handwritten notes and in-person phone-calls to companies he buys. 

Howard Marks, in his book The Most Important Thing, explains how technical analysis/chart reading is nowhere near as important as it used to be. the data simply isn't there so show it's useful in the long-term.

195,OR," A mutual fund and an ETF are only types of investment vehicles. They are not specific investments per se. An ETF or a mutual fund can track an index, making either an index fund.  Confusing, I guess. 

You should probably look at index funds. They are very low cost, diversified, and passively follow specific segments of the market OR the entire market. This makes it easy to track the market’s overall performance rather than relying on stock picking, which can be very risky.

Depending on the brokerage you use, each one has similar products. The total US stock market fund at Fidelity is FSKAX. It’s VTSAX at Vanguard, and SWTSX at Schwab.

S&P 500 index funds at these brokers are FXAIX, VFIAX, and SWPPX respectively. 

An ETF is a fund that may be traded in real time like a stock. Many of the same products are available in ETF form. VTI is the Vanguard total US market ETF. VOO is their S&P 500 ETF.

196,IMO," - a mutual fund is a collection of stocks, bonds or other assets. these are ""mutual"" because they're owned mutually by a group of people. 

- an ETF is also a collection of stocks or other assets. the main differences are (1) ETFs trade in the middle of the day like stocks, so the price can fluctuate mid-day, but mutual funds trade only on one price at the end of the day and (2) ETFs will have an additional fee called the ""bid/ask spread"" -- bid is the buyer price, ask is the seller price. there's always a gap even if it's just a penny (but it can be much larger_, and you pay this fee to whoever handles the trade each time you buy/sell. IMO the only major advantage to ETFs is in a taxable account, because they're structured to minimize capital gains taxes. in a tax-sheltered retirement account, capital gains doesn't matter. 

- an index fund is one strategy for mutual fund or ETF investing -- an index tracks a sector of the market and doesn't do detailed stock-by-stock or company-by-company analysis. for example the Russell 1000 is just a list of the largest 1000 companies that trade on the US stock markets. every 4 months, they adjust the list as companies get bigger or smaller. the type of company, or if the company is profitable or not doesn't factor into the list. in contrast there are growth stock funds (companies growing faster than average for their type), or value investing (companies where the stock is on sale relative to the value of the company, like buying a $10,000 car for $5,000). there are sector funds (healthcare stocks, energy stocks), or other strategies. indexing will have lower management fees, and over time it's difficult to beat the averages of the overall market. so there's a wide agreement that most of your investing should be in low-fee funds.",harrison_wintergreen,2,/r/stocks/comments/ni66ut/mutual_fund_vs_index_fund_vs_etf/gz2tkzu/,0.026,0.856,0.118,0.9826

217,BABA," I think a lot of Western investors are used to thinking about companies in a certain way that don't translate to BABA's situation very well. They expect a free market where companies rise and fall based (mostly) on their merits. In that world BABA is severely undervalued and will inevitably go back up to ATHs. However in China the government is above all and anything that might threaten that control is targeted and eliminated with brutal efficiency. BABA was the nail that stuck out and got hammered down.

The government will never allow BABA to amass as much power in China as a company like Amazon has in the West. So where does that leave their future? I don't think anyone knows. But this could very well hang over their heads forever. They should recover somewhat but could very well stagnate for years with their growth potential severely limited. In the worst case they go too hard again and the CCP really screws with them.
