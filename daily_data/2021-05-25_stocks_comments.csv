9,JD," Most companies(if not all) that grow in size become less efficient. From business decisions and processes to technological innovation , things move very slowly and become inefficient.

You only need to look at modern examples (standard oil comes to mind) to see how breaking up monopolies benefited shareholders immensely. Standard oil was broken up into 34 separate companies and many of those become some of the largest and most powerful companies today. Not only did it increase the share prices of these forms, it more than quintupled JD Rockefeller net worth. 

In general companies that become very large can become very fragile ( think aig) when a company that large fails, there are significant impacts to the market and their own shareholders. By breaking up monopolies into smaller parts companies the market can become more “antifragile” (if you don’t know what that means go read the book by Taleb) but essentially it prevents the greater possibility of significant and harmful effects (aka market crash or company bankruptcy).",bosydomo7,7,/r/stocks/comments/nkqj4f/amazons_ad_revenue_is_now_twice_as_big_as_snap/gzf8gkg/,0.042,0.853,0.105,0.7269

I think that is another thing that NIO has to fight against. The lack of trust in Chinese products.

53,AMD," I agree with everything the OP said in their post. I invested a good chunk of my cash (about 20%) in the companies that i believe in such as Amazon, Apple, Airbnb, Microsoft, Facebook, Nividia, Paypal, AMD, Palantir, Snowflake, Beyond Meat and will not ideally have to touch them for at least 5-10 years (that’s the goal). I saved a good chunk of cash for the dips when the market crashes. Sometimes days go by before i look at my portfolio.
I think people who are panicky when the market starts going down and start selling do have their money in the stocks only for short term gains. These people could be losing on big gains in the future.
Id rather have a line of credit ready and untouched as my emergency funds than sell stocks at a loss when the market crashes. Yoi can pay off the debt (if needed to be used) probably in a year when the market bounces back.

78,AAPL," The market is saturated, but the way I see it is that Peloton is like Apple. I personally know people who love Peloton and would probably buy anything if it had Peloton branding. That is eerily similar to Apple. I remember when Apple was consistently making inferior products compared to Samsung and other Android phones and yet they sold out because of their loyal customers. 

On top of that, they also sell clothing. Owning Peloton product is a statement just like owning Apple product is a statement. One of the biggest reasons why Peloton hasn't been profitable is because of the massive amount of money they have put into marketing and development. They spend roughly 40-60% of their yearly revenue on marketing per year. They truly are positioning themselves to become the top of the line industry-standard company. 

If you're deciding to buy or sell Peloton stock based on the performance of yesterday and today, you are buying and selling the stock with the wrong intention. This is a long term hold, in my opinion this is the fitness version of getting into AAPL in the early generations of the iPhone. Peloton is a huge disruption in their industry when you take into account the full company and not just the production side of it. Like someone else said, other companies sell future yard-sale equipment. Peloton sells an experience, and if a person buys the bike and subscribes to their business model, it'll take 4 years to make the same gross revenue from their subscription as they did with the bike. I get that 4 years is a lot of time, but other companies aren't adding that kind of value to their product. Other companies bucks stop once the customer has purchased the equipment.

 Also something that no one really takes into account is that Peloton still has yet to **really** enter the commercial market. Gyms have yet to properly utilize Peloton to increase their customer base. Peloton has worked with some hotels, allowing guests to sign into their Peloton accounts on equipment in the hotel gyms.

101,GME," I've been investing since the late 90's and think the idea of building a community around an investment, and that the community should offer moral support to each other, and that the investment thesis *requires* recruiting more people to invest and hold in the stock even as it goes down - is really fucking sad and ridiculous. 

These communities are basically support groups for people who make sketchy investments, just like a cult or people falling for a scam.

And yes, I've read the GME ""DD"". I understand the short squeeze aspect. But nothing in there suggests that the price of GME will actually hit astronomical levels, in the tens of thousands or even millions. The people who believe that are idiots and just don't understand law.

Yes, you can say ""hedge funds are required to cover shorts"". But where does the money come from? That's like saying that homeowners are ""required to pay their mortgage"". Yes, they are. But sometimes they don't. And they get foreclosed on. You can't take money from someone who is out of money.

There's no situation where a hedge fund will be paying $10k/share for GME to cover a short position. They will go bankrupt before that happens. They will be liquidated before that happens, and if they can't be liquidated then their *broker* will be liquidated and go out of business, a-la Lehman Bros.

People who make comments saying that they're poor and they hold one share hoping that it goes to $10M so they can escape poverty are gullible idiots with no financial knowledge and it's sad that the GME groups are taking advantage of people like that, propping them up, and offering them moral support instead of kicking them in the ass and telling them to get a fucking grip on reality. Fuck everything about that ""movement"" and ""community"".

If you think you are going to build ""generational wealth"" from a single stock holding due to a technicality in security law (which won't pan out...) then you need help. You've been tricked, just like Qanon followers. You'll be holding worthless shares for years proclaiming that they'll be worth millions someday, while you slip further into poverty and delusion.",irresponsible_owl,4,/r/stocks/comments/nkx8pc/dodid_you_participate_in_the_meme_stock_movement/gzfgtpb/,0.144,0.744,0.112,-0.9528

I owe the gains entirely to Reddit where I saw many great posts in this subreddit explaining the extremely unusual situation, and why if was likely a short squeeze would happen.

139,COIN," Took notice in January and began researching what was going on.  The information was deep, but not very broad.  The official response from major firms performing research was to avoid.  

Began taking positions in February (200 @ $225).  More research (DD) came out and noticed the groundswell of support.  

Increased positions.  Currently holding XXXX with total $57K gain as of today.

* Treat it as part of your FU money from your portfolio (not more than 10% in total)
* Do your research.  They got your attention, but it's YOUR money.

165,AMC," >Simple, the retail market owns the float (at least 80/90%) and already voted no to the dilution proposal.

How do you know that retail owns the entire float? That's a pretty massive claim, so you need to substantiate it. AMC has 25% institutional ownership which is enough for shareholders to push for the company to offer more shares, plus the dilution vote was only for the 500 million shares they wanted to offer (correct me if I'm wrong on this) and they're not under any obligation to not offer more shares. Plus, why wouldn't AMC want to capitalize on this? It would get them out of the dire debt situation they're in, and the fact that they were intending to offer 500 million shares shows that they have the motivation to do so, should demand be so high. 

&#x200B;

>We own the float and we are not selling, and there is a crazy amount of naked shorts to cover: this is not about fundamentals, this is about the illegal naked short selling done for over a year.

Ok, so they are many problems with this. First of all, there isn't any concrete proof that AMC is completely owned by the float, unless every AMC holder in retail tallies their shares. Second, even if you aren't selling, traders can still short the stock, by borrowing shares, I'm not sure how this is relevant.  Third, I'm pretty confident that naked shorting is illegal, and if AMC was so heavily shorted in the fashion you're talking about, then the data should prove so, but it's not. The current % of the float short is at around 20% which is high, but nowhere near high enough to create such a massive return. These are the statistics that we can find on any AMC quote, and I don't understand how these things could be so massively faked across literally every single financial site, with no whistleblower coming to call them out on it, not to mention it would probably cost them more money to cover it up than to have it entirely open, and AMC hasn't even had a catalyst for a squeeze yet.",mithyyyy,4,/r/stocks/comments/nkx8pc/dodid_you_participate_in_the_meme_stock_movement/gzfnsdj/,0.06,0.878,0.062,0.192

They could just return all the money to shareholders, but have you ever seen an organization do that? It isn't that simple. Board members that don't think they can accomplish the task would make more money by liquidating their stock at the current price -- which some have.

Rebuttal #2: You are right that SpaceX is in a different market. They can go orbital, which is cooler and lasts longer than 5 minutes -- but currently costs 10s of millions per seat. They will need starship to bring that down but if they can -- at similar prices, SPCE has no way of competing against that.

BO is on the trajectory of doing orbital, but they currently have a comparable suborbital experience to SPCE and it's going to happen roughly at the same time (first paying customer in the summer). The existence of this will reduce SPCEs margins and market share.

I'm not quite sure there will be enough people interested in a mid-6 digit cost 5-minute experience. Everyone is handwaving here.

188,UWMC," I think there's probably good trades to be had, and these all are probably an ok long term investment. UWMC is my favorite and I too think 10 dollars is a fair, I hold some in my retirement account. In my trading account its been one of my best trades to date, and I do like the company. So this is not meant to be overly negative because they have a few great things going for them. but the industry as a whole is predicting a major draw down. Both Rocket and UWMC have outlined this in their earnings calls. Both of these companies make most of their money from refinances and both note and estimate significantly less earnings in 2022. Go look at their 2019 earnings compared to 2020. I'm convinced they saw the writing on the wall and saw it as a great time to go public. Smart move.

>**UWM originated $42.6 billion in refinance volume during 4Q20, as compared to $20.3 billion in 4Q19. UWM originated $139.6 billion in refinance volume in FY20 and $57.9 billion in FY19. UWM’s 2020 production mix was comprised of 76% refinance and 24% purchase.**

UWMC also pushed away \~500 of \~12000 brokers with their ultimatum, and who knows if that number will trend upward as more loan officers and companies get annoyed by being held hostage. Imagine if their client gets quoted a better rate from Rocket, as a loan officer their job is to deliver affordable, good loans, and if they cant use them to service the needs of a client, it would be pretty shitty spot to be in. I think in the long term this will be fine, but in the short term I think it was a bit short sighted. Great tech, industry leading close times, their slice of the mortgage pie is growing yoy but with some unfortunate turmoil short term (Market draw door, 500 less lenders working with them, etc)",_Please,2,/r/stocks/comments/nkc3fe/just_a_trade_idea_there_could_be_a_great/gzd04a7/,0.05,0.809,0.141,0.9823

Aside from a meme spike a couple months ago this stock lived around $20 during their best quarters. I don’t see a huge upside from here.

As for mortgages in general, have you noticed that nothing is for sale right now? New mortgage volume is super low. Once rates creep back up people will stop refinancing, further killing volume.",trail34,2,/r/stocks/comments/nkc3fe/just_a_trade_idea_there_could_be_a_great/gzdrvc2/,0.134,0.761,0.105,-0.2023
192,GME," **Avoid.**

Are you trying to make a quick buck, in it for the short term, or long term investor?  

**RKT** came into focus a few months ago when it came out that it was being targeted by short-sellers ($24/sh).  The CEO took the strong arm position that he was going to go against them and the stock responded positively (due to GME being in the news then).  This was prior to earnings, and even CNBC commented on it compliments of Cramer IIRC ($28/sh)

A few days later it went back down to it's prior price point ($25/sh), and though earnings were positive, it continued to decline.  Now $16/sh.

It's basically under attack and as many saavy investors recognize, short-sellers are betting against the company for a reason.

In that business, you make money from the interest (as a lender, compliments of amortization), origination and other fees as a service provider.  

Interest rates declining incentivize people to refinance a mortgage, or to move to a new home (property tax caps be forgotten).  This means greater profits when rates are decreasing.  

Interest rates have no more room to go down, and people are going to hold on to their mortgage rates (0.5% to 0.75% difference) meaning amortization plays a role in favor of the borrower.  

Millennials have been adverse to buying homes, preferring to rent.  Builders in large cities have accommodated this trend as well.  Evictions have held off and affordable housing coming into a larger role the last few years.

Long term investors like Mr. Buffett have exited the financials market (e.g. WFB) which include lenders.  Back to that original question, what kind of investor are you?

I remember WAMU and Countrywide.  Today it's dominated by Quicken and a dozen years back it was another lender (forgot the name) and it'll be different a dozen years from now.

Anyhow, I'd avoid the entire mortgage / lender sector:

* Refinancing decreases when rates are low, or increasing
* COVID has impacted income for many people
* Evictions on hold, but now that they can be relaxed, expect people to exhibit poor credit
* Preference for renting in city-centers versus buying in the 'burbs.

But hey, that's me.  I'd love some data for someone to convince me otherwise.",Qs9bxNKZ,2,/r/stocks/comments/nkc3fe/just_a_trade_idea_there_could_be_a_great/gzfs2nm/,0.033,0.849,0.118,0.9805

195,RKT," Bear in mind RKT has a very high retention rate for it’s sector. Most clients who purchase with RKT will refinance with RKT. 

Cash-out refinance is also RKT’s bread & butter, which is looking pretty sexy considering all the consumer debt and home value increases. I used to write those loans, they were absolute no-brainers and RKT’s target market is definitely laden with consumer debt. RKT retail bankers are going to be calling everyone’s ditzy aunt and uncle to get the credit card debt out of high interest accounts and into the mortgage. You wave $200+ savings/month at someone and they will be hard pressed to say no.

Then consider RKT’s residential product is priced 1-2 points higher than its competitors, these guys do it all for the volume, because as we all know they get paid the crumbs of the origination volume. 

This RKT thing isn’t over yet. They have so many leads and the lead flow is so insane. Not to mention a bunch of mortgages are still in the money. For whatever reason, not everyone qualifies for a refinance, it takes a couple of tries for some borrowers. Those borrowers are RKT’s safety net.

254,CCO," In relation to the operations of the company itself? 

The company is in the process of swiftly overhauling its entire business strategy with Ryan Cohen, founder of Chewy at the helm. And there's optimism and an element of hype behind the process in a nutshell. 

Given the success of Chewy, with its focus on excellent customer service, achieving customer loyalty, planning and setting up of its fulfillment centers and logistics network for delivering its products, the idea is that Ryan Cohen is someone who has credible experience and understanding of constructing successful ecommerce businesses. 

An ecommerce business that could still exist and compete, despite juggernauts like Amazon already existing and having a sizeable foothold in the sector. 

In August 2020, it's revealed he purchased a ~13% stake of the company, which suddenly makes him a major shareholder. 

Being an activist investor, this caused rumblings about whether he was going to step in and play a more ""active"" role in shaping the future of the company. Otherwise, what did he see in this supposedly dying company that he would go in and buy a huge chunk of it? 

A couple of months go by without a lot of noise, when all of a sudden, a filing through the SEC reveals that Cohen (through his investment firm) officially sent the company's board an aggressive letter basically saying how much the video game market has grown over the past decade, how the company has failed to capitalize on it and obtain market share, and refuses to change its antiquated ways at the expense of the shareholders. 

It turns out he tried reaching out to board members several times beforehand to discuss needing to change things up, and all attempts fell on deaf ears and were given cold shoulders. This just emboldened him, ""well if you guys aren't gonna take this seriously, then I'll just take it to the next level.""

January 2021, it's announced Cohen officially gains board seats, not only for himself, but also for two former Chewy executives, the CFO (Jim Grube) and CMO (Alan Attal). He's effectively consolidating power over the company in order to steer it the way he wants. 

March, news surfaces that the company's CFO and CCO (Chief Customer Officer) are resigning in a sign of upper management/C-suite shakeup. Hires of former high-level employees of Amazon, Walmart, and Chewy are announced, to swiftly begin the reconstruction of the business.

April, CEO George Sherman looks to be given the boot as it's announced he's also resigning and the company announces that it's in the process of searching for a successor that will be fit to execute the company's new vision. The board announces Ryan Cohen is the planned new chairman of the board after the voting from the annual shareholder meeting in June takes place.

300,CRWD," One of the biggest concerns for many years was GameStop's high level of debt. And, this was also one of the reasons for the shorters' high conviction over the doom of the company. 

Well ... in the beginning of May, the company announced it took advantage of the elevated price of GME, issued ~3.5 million shares to the market, and raised roughly half a billion dollars. 

And ... supposedly with this new war chest, paid off essentially all of its outstanding debt. The debt that shorters thought had the company cornered and set to crumble.

Now, the question is, is the current price of GME somewhat reasonable or completely whacko. 
I am of the opinion that it may be high, but it's really not that insane given all the supposedly positive things happening within the company that point to massive change and its valuation relative to market conditions. 

At its current range, it moves between 10B-20B, which I can understand people wanting to say it's high af. 

However, look at our current market environment. We have a ton of companies doing less than 500M, 300M, 200M in revenue a quarter ... some barely profitable, many aren't profitable at all ... being valued at 20B, 30B, 50B ... 90B+ ... DDOG, CRWD, NET, DKNG, DASH ... SHOP is at 153B valuation off <1B quarterly revenue. 

Yet, somehow GME with 2B+ revenue last quarter at something like 15B valuation is completely bonkers and deserves more criticism and spotlight compared to all these other, imo, more bonkers companies.

Even Chewy itself has revenue/earnings comparable to GameStop, yet was valued at nearly 50B just 3 months back.

The thing that GameStop doesn't have compared to many of these other companies is actual revenue growth.
Its revenue figures completely stagnated for many years, and began dropping the past couple.

I'm not saying these are bad companies or anything. And comparing GameStop to these other companies isn't exactly apples to apples. I just don't understand when people call GameStop insanely overvalued, but conveniently fail to associate all these other instances of even more outlandish valuations. 

If the company can reestablish growth, its valuation is gonna go way past what it is now judging by how the stocks of all these other companies have performed.

Now, as for the whole ""squeeze"" and the superstonk community, yeah, there's a lot of nuttiness and straight-up conspiracy theory there. I've lost track of the number of times the community believed something was gonna happen on some date, and nothing of significance ends up happening unsurprisingly. 

However, I also don't believe that there's absolutely nothing fishy going on with the short situation. 

Some of the accusations on naked shorting, hiding shorts, DTCC being irresponsible, SEC not doing their job do have merit to an extent. However, I believe a lot of the theories there put it all on steroids, and the actual truth is somewhere in the middle. 

The '$10 Million is the Floor' is completely loco.
However, I wouldn't rule out the possibility of a further squeeze either. 
It would be a couple thousand at best imo.

There just isn't a whole lot of transparency. 
And there are tactics to hide the size of positions from public knowledge.
So, the amount of actual exposure currently at stake against GME isn't clear.",Clamhead99,1,/r/stocks/comments/nklllm/rstocks_daily_discussion_technicals_tuesday_may/gzfd4q2/,0.081,0.826,0.093,0.8597

At its current range, it moves between 10B-20B, which I can understand people wanting to say it's high af. 

However, look at our current market environment. We have a ton of companies doing less than 500M, 300M, 200M in revenue a quarter ... some barely profitable, many aren't profitable at all ... being valued at 20B, 30B, 50B ... 90B+ ... DDOG, CRWD, NET, DKNG, DASH ... SHOP is at 153B valuation off <1B quarterly revenue. 

Yet, somehow GME with 2B+ revenue last quarter at something like 15B valuation is completely bonkers and deserves more criticism and spotlight compared to all these other, imo, more bonkers companies.

Even Chewy itself has revenue/earnings comparable to GameStop, yet was valued at nearly 50B just 3 months back.

The thing that GameStop doesn't have compared to many of these other companies is actual revenue growth.
Its revenue figures completely stagnated for many years, and began dropping the past couple.

I'm not saying these are bad companies or anything. And comparing GameStop to these other companies isn't exactly apples to apples. I just don't understand when people call GameStop insanely overvalued, but conveniently fail to associate all these other instances of even more outlandish valuations. 

If the company can reestablish growth, its valuation is gonna go way past what it is now judging by how the stocks of all these other companies have performed.

Now, as for the whole ""squeeze"" and the superstonk community, yeah, there's a lot of nuttiness and straight-up conspiracy theory there. I've lost track of the number of times the community believed something was gonna happen on some date, and nothing of significance ends up happening unsurprisingly. 

However, I also don't believe that there's absolutely nothing fishy going on with the short situation. 

Some of the accusations on naked shorting, hiding shorts, DTCC being irresponsible, SEC not doing their job do have merit to an extent. However, I believe a lot of the theories there put it all on steroids, and the actual truth is somewhere in the middle. 

The '$10 Million is the Floor' is completely loco.
However, I wouldn't rule out the possibility of a further squeeze either. 
It would be a couple thousand at best imo.

There just isn't a whole lot of transparency. 
And there are tactics to hide the size of positions from public knowledge.

302,DDOG," One of the biggest concerns for many years was GameStop's high level of debt. And, this was also one of the reasons for the shorters' high conviction over the doom of the company. 

Well ... in the beginning of May, the company announced it took advantage of the elevated price of GME, issued ~3.5 million shares to the market, and raised roughly half a billion dollars. 

And ... supposedly with this new war chest, paid off essentially all of its outstanding debt. The debt that shorters thought had the company cornered and set to crumble.

Money won’t go back to many of the past speculative bets. Inflation isn’t the only problem here. Speculation follows momentum, and that also works downward.

You should check the article I linked. It’s a fund manager who expects the market to be lower at year end … yet he is fully invested for short term gains. But he is also scanning for signs of impeding corrections.

That’s what we have now IMO. Money chasing short term gains but oh-so-ready to race to dump at the first sign that there will be a sign of the expected trouble materializing.",year0000,2,/r/stocks/comments/nklllm/rstocks_daily_discussion_technicals_tuesday_may/gzdzbbw/,0.094,0.851,0.054,-0.6597

363,RSI," As a swing trader (someone who buys/sells within 2 weeks), I find my stocks through general people, [shiftsearch.com](https://shiftsearch.com), certain indicators on thinkorswim that help me find stocks with a low RSI, upcoming events (such as earnings, or company announcements), some watchlists i've created for certain sectors, and if i'm day trading, premarket volatility. My most important tool is, however, listening about a stock that is being hyped up, then formulating my own opinions on it.

A good example of a stock being hyped up is $SQ, and their whole [checkings account fiasco](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-24/square-to-take-aim-at-jpmorgan-with-checking-savings-accounts). I bought in some calls before market close yesterday, sold it this morning, no need for financial analysis (although I probably should've) Just a check on people's hype, a look at the article, my own trust in the company, etc... You probably shouldn't do this, but for someone like me who spends their entire day swinging, this is pretty normal.

An example of me using indicators is that I use ThinkOrSwim stock hacker to set up and find stocks with a low RSI. The scanner gives me a list of stocks, I check their net change, how many days they've been bleeding out, if its their first time being this low, how unsure is this company, are there any clear patterns, etc... A good example is when I bought $JD (I think a week or two ago?) It was near the lower band of RSI, and while Jd has been sort of bleeding in the past months, it had clear indications that it rises, then falls a little bit lower than what it use to be.

 Use EMA5, EMA10, MacD, RSI, Bollinger Bands, etc... and hope to god that nothing random happens in the market, and you're kosher.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but the shares have been diluted 3x since 2019 [(there are 3x more shares now than in 2019 due to share issuance and AMC raising capital)](https://ycharts.com/companies/AMC/shares_outstanding) yet you think it's worth more than it was in 2019? 

The market cap in 2019 was $1 billion but today it's $4 billion...

They don't seem to have made any acquisitions of note [(source 1)](https://www.crunchbase.com/search/acquisitions/field/organizations/num_acquisitions/amc-entertainment-holdings), [(source 2)](https://www.amctheatres.com/corporate/amc-history)

401,DD," >valuations dropped drastically from the beginning of the year

Your arbitrary time period doesn’t mean anything. Expand that time period to a year and they have massive growth. Nothing about that predicts the future. You can choose any combination of time periods to fit whatever scenario you are looking for.

>so they only have to return to where they already were

Says what? Says who? Why do *you* know this and everyone else doesn’t? Where’s your proof? 

>Wall street spent months talking about moving out of growth and going to cyclicals

No. The talking heads talked about their analysis of money flow.

The money flow is entirely obvious. Pandemic destroyed cyclicals, so money flows out of that into tech/medical. Pandemic eases, money slowly flows back into cyclical. But we also see money flowing into commodities. So now we get to predict where money flows back into. Or does it just settle to pre-covid. Most analysts see the money flowing to the most reasonable forward earnings; that is not tech. 

Just because a once in a century event inflated the price of a stock, doesn’t mean that price is representative of the company’s outlook. The price movements in 2020 were not organic. 

>so eventually they’ll go back

Again, where’s your proof? Why do you know what they are going to do with their money when they don’t even know yet?

I’m willing to wager you have not evaluated any of these growth stocks for future earnings and are basing all of your decisions on the 1Y stock chart and wishful thinking that everything is guaranteed to return to 52W highs and you started calculating your returns. Probably been watching too much Ricky Guttierez.

Nothing fundamentally bad about the company,  and they're reinvesting in increased manufacturing capacity,  facilities,  expanding in automotive etc. This is not only value,  but dropped into ""growth"" territory.  You can pay about 10x earnings,  3x book and 3x sales. Which is both value,  and you can't buy any peers growth for that cheap.  

Now I'm not saying go buy intc,  not was this the intent.
