I also wouldn’t recommend posting what stocks you want to buy/sell unless you’ve already bought or sold them. You’re basically just giving your strategy away to get played.

As far as their financial go... from what I can see they look great. They have some great margins especially on the accessories they manufacture and on average at 38% across all lines. They are one of the very few that are profitable and not bleeding cash every quarter. Nice fresh cash injection for more acquisitions and great online presence with grasscity.com

DDC also has a partnership with Air Canada and a lot of pending LOIs which should turn into purchase orders soon. Now I mentioned drone saas, what does that mean?

DDC has a patented FLYTE software which ANY drone can be programmed too. With A lot of other companies in the drone space you are buying the actual drone, with FLT it is both the drone and the technology. FLT has also recently added an ai aspect to their drone technology which will be huge. We also have ~20m in cash laying around which keeps us healthy from an expansion point of view and we don’t have to worry about running out of cash like some of the others guys.

167,DD," I bought into European Metals Holdings $EMHLF at 0.90 today.

Sitting on a massive pile of lithium (by comparison, it's maybe 1.5x as big as LIACF' in the western USA) on the Czech border, the project is 51% owned by the government, so regulatory and financial support will be easier.  Right near all sorts of battery and auto manufacturers in the clean-energy supportive Eurozone.  China is increasingly keeping their raw materials in China, so new sources locally will have plenty of demand.

Experienced mining execs are running the show.  They're going to mine tin and other metals at the same time, increasing revenues and reducing waste.  The whole thing is super interesting, and given the rise in other lithium producers (the aforementioned LIACF, which I also own was up like 100% in the last month), I love this play.

Obviously, this is not financial advice; do your own DD.  I just read a lot about it and the more I saw, the more I liked.  It's only been trading since November, I think, so there is plenty of room to run.  They project 21 years of full-time mining once it kicks off... so once the income begins, I think it pops pretty hard.  But what do I know.

I am long EMHLF and LIACF.",ProgressivePatriarch,3,/r/pennystocks/comments/lcar67/daily_plays_february_04_2021/gm12qwm/,0.025,0.841,0.134,0.976

I actually kind of like CBBT, they have a real product that might be a little late for the Covid surge, but I think has real practical applications in medicine (it's a transparent facemask they got through acquisition) that acquisition also gives them some vertical integration as a medical device company. (Company acquired, PKG, is a manufacturer)

 but ALST was something I saw on iHub and looked like it was picking up volume/volatility but hadn't really ""popped"" yet, so that's a little more speculative. (I am a decent fundamentals investor, but technical trading is new to me)

My positions in both are relatively small, since I haven't traded pennies since 2011 and it didn't go well for my back then.

Second question - When buying penny stocks, I have read that you should be using a limit purchase option. How do I set the limit purchase price on a rising stock so that it doesnt pass me by without ever filling the order? i.e. stock is at .003 and ask is .0032, what should the limit order be placed at?

325,LNG," This play is way more complicated than OPs post or even your post. Like to the point that it actually hurts.

LNG is a global commodity. Penny stocks are fun, but global commodity trading is a whole new level of complicated if you want a well informed position.

Two things matter for LNG. The domestic cost of NG, and the foreign cost of NG.

Some things that go into natural gas prices. Politics (which you started with), weather, storage levels, power sector demand, coal prices, drilling technique, active rig count, drilled but uncompleted wells, geology, estimated reserves, transportation rates, pipeline critical notices, associated gas production for oil wells, all the things that move the oil market around.

Now you have the domestic price. Now do this again for every country on the planet. Now find the difference. This is the maximum revenue! Wait, now do it again because extracting and shipping that much LNG around the globe will change literally all of your assumptions around cost and production.

Now that you’ve done it a few times and figured out that LNG does or doesn’t make sense, you can look at this company and what is their competitive advantage.

I’ve paid companies hundreds of thousands of dollars to do this analysis, they get it wrong. In fact they’re always wrong. And they have teams of people running complicated simulations. 

Not to mention building an LNG plant is kind of hard. I realize they said it’s permitted but nothing is ever really done being permitted in today’s day and age. Anything with tanks measured in BCF will be a huge deal and face giant opposition from the environmental community. Heaven forbid you need to build a new pipeline to the facility.

That said, it’s a penny stock, don’t take it too seriously. But if anyone buys this thinking they’re well informed, they’re wrong.

I won’t hate on OP tooo much because I’d actually like to see more O&G stocks on here.

Guess who the principle and founder of of SGCI (a european financial/ invesment firm) is?  DS Chang, the current CEO of Resort.  Through SGCI they bought Teishan Oil in ?2016 or so.  

My guess is this is an attempt to bring Wandi public, build up a big holding company (with a few more disinfectant company additions in progress as well), and then go for uplisting (again DS Change was interested in doing this several years ago).",10xwannabe,2,/r/pennystocks/comments/lc3tzu/i_will_give_you_a_gem_i_found_rssv/glzklmh/,0.0,0.907,0.093,0.925
374,DD," I just finished doing the minimum DD on the company before I decide to go in. **I'll buy tiny bit** (200) just in case, but here's **something to keep in mind to help avoid FOMO jump**.

They tweeted they were enrolling patients for Phase 3 on Jan 27th. I'm sure it will be nice presentation, but I doubt that the stock price will be going through the roof. There would be an update on their other main product's milestone (CITI-002) but again, that won't be a major catalyst either.

To see their presentation skills, I tracked their past presentations and the stock price changes around those periods. Nothing special there.

**I personally like the company, and I think it's a good long play** (I'm expecting a better catalyst within a couple of months time from Phase 3), but I think we need to **keep our expectations in check this time.**

444,CBD," Hi,
If anyone think it is good time or not for entry in each cannabis stock, think that this decade will be sure the cannabis decade.

I'm a cannabis producer and I know the big numbers in this business
>CBDD (cannabis, obviously) is a micro-penny, but has clean balance sheet, $10 million total revenue 3rd/4th quarter, already 2.6 million in revenue for January, successful CBD and Hemp oil pilot program in 5 retail stores in Switzerland (140+ stores in chain). They are looking to uplist to OTCQB (being audited to prepare for application). Up from triple zeros in November. Rare to find an OTC with clean balance sheet, growing sales and revenue, and transparent management. Good accumulation stock for anyone, but especially for people without a lot of cash. Probably the best micro/sub penny stock I've seen with regard to finances. This one is a no-brainer for the mid to long term.

CBDL - Double zero OTC, but has good news, growth, and CBD product. Recreational marijuana is now legal in Arizona (company based in Scottsdale, AZ). Definite risk factor for this one, but it is cheap and stock price is increasing.

449,BB," There have been multiple time that i always fear the fomo. It usually happens when you constantly watch on it.... what i would suggest is :
1. Only invest what you can afford to loose..coz if you need the money urgently you have to cash out at the price which might be at loss (which might be most of the time for short time frame)
2. Instead of looking at the ticker 24/7 always look for the news on the company you are investing.
3. If you buy at high always do the dollar cost averaging (DCA) this is if you believe in the company they are going to do great in long term alwayys better to buy more stocks when they dip( but yeah human minds is if it goes down it goes down and if it goes up it will go up which is why you always try to buy when the stock goes on a run and expect that it will go up and give you profit which is not always the case)e.g you might have bought idex back then when it was 3 and after the hindenberg research caused it to 1$ you could have bought more share and lowered your avg price to somewhere around 2 or may be 1.50$ based on how much you could have added. 
4. Never buy the stock in the opening because everyone buys at that time and thus the trend is up and you might always buy when the wave is at high thus, wait for the dip during later in the market when the market consolidates.
5. Always take your initial investment and profit when it goes green and don’t be greedy! My personal experience is i had bought 541 shares of BB at avg price of 8.23. I sold 141 at avg price of 25$ i only sold nearly equal to my investment . Now I don’t have to worry whether the stock goes down or up coz i already took out my investment. I can leave it for as many years as i can. I still have 400 shares so if it goes 100$ a share in 2 years or 3 year or may be in month or 2 I’d be happy. Even if it goes low down to 5$ a share i still get 2k profit if i sell.
6. Which bring me to another point that realised paper loss/profit. You don’t loose or gain unless you sell your stock/securities. Always remember that Realised gain> unrealised gain. 

I might have missed more things but this is what i have learned how to control FOMO. Or my experience so far

Back to back filing days to start this week took it to nearly 3 cents. Today was the first day it struggled a bit due to a lack of any new filing so far and even so, it ended green.

I think people realize that even if it's not a flashy company expected to run big, it has easy 10-20 cent potential if what is known about it is correct and based on this history of the CEO. And I know some people think it could double that. So for its price, considering it is expected to become current soon and go on a PR blitz to let shareholders know what's happening with its new enterprise... well it seems like a good deal still.

JNJ also has a vaccine candidate that should be approved for distribution in the US within a month and it is a one shot and has standard storage requirements and is producing monster quantities of it.

I hope OCGN pays off for everyone but it seems like it is too far behind to put up huge numbers in the US.",veilwalker,3,/r/pennystocks/comments/lcni54/opinions_on_ocugen_inc_ocgn/gm0xo2t/,0.0,0.856,0.144,0.8735
485,DD," My thoughts exactly. Their vaccine has a huge advantage in terms of stability since it can be stored at much more reasonable temps than competitors and the demand is sure to keep growing, especially since many experts believe Covid is going to be a recurring/seasonal thing like the flu that will require yearly vaccinations. Plus under their deal they are getting 45% of the profits for what is largely a completed product, their end of the deal is going to mostly be securing regulatory approval in the US and possibly tweaking the formula to adjust for future changes. So I’m sold on the idea of significant growth at least for the next year. But that 2018 plummet in stock value was insane and for whatever reason I just can’t find any articles discussing what caused it. It’s a big enough drop that I can’t overlook it during DD, I need some idea of what happened there.",Captain_Sacktap,2,/r/pennystocks/comments/lcni54/opinions_on_ocugen_inc_ocgn/gm0vyp4/,0.053,0.794,0.153,0.9325
486,UK," The article says they have initiated talks with the FDA to set up a regulatory path for emergency use authorization. No US study yet, but it’s in Phase 3 in India, who have given EUA, and the results are apparently good. The big selling points seem to be that it’s a single shot, decent storage requirements, effective on a large number of COVID strains including the UK variant, and produces a longer term, persistent immune response in recipients. Given that they have not yet started US trials I don’t think they will benefit from the initial wave of vaccines, but the effectiveness of the product is promising and could set them up as a major player in the later stages of the vaccination initiative as well as in the longer term, year-to-year vaccine market if COVID indeed becomes a persistent, seasonal thing like many experts seem to believe it will.",Captain_Sacktap,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/lcni54/opinions_on_ocugen_inc_ocgn/gm10l2a/,0.038,0.804,0.158,0.9661
