2,VS," Welcome to capitalism. Workers/employees have no say over the value they added, the eventual profits everybody helped to produce. The top/board of directors pays it out as dividends to shareholders (which they often are too), instead of higher salaries. Often a few people in a capitalist enterprise/country own the majority of shares (10% of richest people in the world own 80% of the shares, and it's increasing, that's what capitalism does), the workers either own none or very few shares in comparison, so have zero say in any of the key decisions, that do influence them.

The top/board of directors are chosen by the shareholders, every share 1 vote, so you see how this is as undemocratic and hierarchical as it is. They make all the key decisions based on profits, and profits alone, because the shareholders want their profit. Move the factory abroad and thousands of jobs lost? That's the people's/communities/governments problem and cost (huge costs that outweigh the profits) to bear, not the capitalist enterprises concern. A different way would be workers co'ops, where everyone has an equal say in what to produce, where to produce, and what to do with the profits that everybody helped to produce. Little chance workers would vote their jobs to be lost and production moved abroad.

Rising salaries, instead of the stagnation for example the US has had since the 1970's (real wages in the VS are the same as they were in the late 70's!!!) promotes spending in the real economy, goods and services, creating jobs and flowing of money, whereas the stock markets/capitalist enterprise only purpose is to make profit, often at the cost of jobs, the climate, employees, etc

Consider a thought experiment: you get one million monkeys that throw darts at a market weighted(so area on board is equal to share of market) board to pick stocks. Consider that they just pick randomly, they should be ON AVERAGE returning exactly the market.

Now among those monkeys, a load of them will make more than the market one year, and another bunch make less. The next year, some of them will make less, and others more and there will be fewer big winners but there'll still be some. And so it goes on until 20 years later even from 1 million monkeys, none remain that have made consistent big returns. Because of course monkeys don't know shit about stocks.

This is one of those things that sounds super smart but falls apart completely upon examination.  The story comes from Malkiel's ""random walk down wall street"" which was quite popular for some time, unfortunately the science behind it was literally nothing more than surface level ""thought experiments"" and analogies.  Once we began actually observing the data we learned that not only is this sentiment unfounded, it's quite literally the opposite of reality.

In general, when one uses an analogy to establish a position on something that contains hard data you should immediately be suspicious of the statement.  The only reason to use analogies and cute stories in the absence of measuring data would be to fool the reader, and in this case it would seem many people are quite open to being fooled.",MasterCookSwag,0,/r/investing/comments/lpodbg/last_year_the_top_25_managers_earned_32_billion/godc6pu/,0.077,0.851,0.072,-0.287

\-Sell their own preventative treatment health products (currently carried in Target)

\-Fills script and sends it to you by mail

They're smart to focus on inconvenient medical issues like birth control scripts, ED, & hair loss. It's a smart strategy to capture a chunk of the younger market and roll out more healthcare solutions.

I like HIMS because they offer telehealth services in addition to fulfilling scripts for you and selling you their own products. Lots of rev streams to capture and really convenient.

My appointment at Hims was cheaper than my dermatologist appointment with insurance & only took 15min of my time to get a diagnosis and treatment shipped to me. And the subscription model they use gives me competitive prices on scripts, even thought I don't go through insurance.

26,TDOC," A couple other relevant points on TDOC (full disclosure: I've been in this name since early 2020):

1. While they get paid per visit, it's also important to note that they also have partnerships with per-member-per-month (PMPM fees). For the visit fees, they are just generating a spread between what they receive from insurance companies and what they pay out to the docs / clinicians on their network. The PMPM fees are more of the ""profit generator"" that they can use to invest in R&D, sales / marketing, etc. Think of it like the Costco membership fees...
2. They recently merged with Livongo, which is a remote patient monitoring / chronic care management business focused on diabetes. This ties well into their strategy to help payors / employers holistically reduce HC costs across their beneficiaries. Diabetes is like \~20% of all healthcare spending in the country so if they're able to contribute to that reduction in system-wide expenses, it could be huge",EBITDA-XIRR,1,/r/investing/comments/lpq85b/i_want_to_talk_about_telehealth/godxmto/,0.008,0.842,0.15,0.9693

40,COST," I would argue... ""NO"".  Why?  If the ""Call"" strike price is below your cost basis, you will likely lose money if the stock prices rises enough to get the stocks called away from you.

But this is MY opinion.

FYI:  Selling ""Covered Calls"" does NOT actually reduce your COST BASIS.  What it does is pay you a fee for writing the call.  (It's kind of the same thing, but it will not be reflected in your account Cost Basis.  They are two distinctly different trading transactions.)",CheonsaGateun,2,/r/investing/comments/lp8m71/selling_covered_calls_to_reduce_cost_basis/god9k4f/,0.05,0.93,0.021,-0.1365

Selling covered calls is like picking up pennies infront of a steamroller.

IMO if its a stock you really believe in, its better just to hold the stock. If the stock shoots up quickly you will be steamrolled and forced to sell. You will miss out on a huge gain. 

Selling calls basically limits your maximum gain while decreasing your risk very slightly. Not worth it.",Shoddy_Ad7511,-6,/r/investing/comments/lp8m71/selling_covered_calls_to_reduce_cost_basis/goa33ku/,0.095,0.647,0.259,0.9473

44,CC," If you really think it's going to take off, you can buy calls instead.  But in that case you aren't benefitting from the shares you already hold.

You can always sell your CC's at a higher strike, but you'll get less in premium.

CC's are a strategy whereby you're skimming income in exchange for limiting your potential on big upswings.  If you see the upswing coming and you think it's going to really keep going, you can buy back your sold call at a loss so that you can keep your shares.  Typically though you want to be selling at a strike where you're ok if you end up selling them, incase you can't buy back your call to close out your CC for a reasonable loss.",holt5301,2,/r/investing/comments/lp8m71/selling_covered_calls_to_reduce_cost_basis/gobkb9b/,0.08,0.854,0.065,-0.2389
45,CC," Stocks that go sideways for a while are perfect candidates for selling covered calls.  Each call that expires worthless is cash gained that effectively reduces your cost basis for holding the stock.

If you have 100 shares of some stock that you think will go up, you don't use CC strategy for that.  You buy calls for that.

Someone mentioned selling puts - NO, that is used when you desire a stock at a specific price.  You'll set aside cash to cover the purchase at the strike price you select, and if the stock goes down below that strike before expiration then you could be forced to buy at that strike price.

62,CC," I apologize in advance for the wall of text.  When selling a CC, you set the strike high (I'm typically at least 30% up, so a $10 stock I would set strike at $15 or higher).  The closer the strike is to the stock price (ATM), the greater the time premium (extrinsic value) that you can make.  But obviously the closer to the strike price means the greater likelihood that a small movement up might put the option ITM, which upon expiration will take your covered shares/option away from you.  The more premium you can collect, which you pay short-term capital gains taxes on, the more value holding the stock is to you.  So some see this as a cost-basis reduction strategy.  Imagine you only have 1 stock, if you buy and hold then all you have is any capital appreciation and paid dividends, but selling covered calls can bring in additional income which increases the value of your account. Since it is holding the stock that allows for you to do this, the stock is effectively bringing in additional income through the CC strategy, and therefore you can look at it as reducing your investment capital in the stock.  Selling CCs can reduce losses during downturns in the stock, and increase returns during stagnant/slow growth periods.

03/18/2020: $85.18/shr (+75.86%) vs S&P 500 (+52.62%)

04/14/2020: $94.7/shr (+58.14%) vs S&P 500 (+40.71%)

04/21/2020: $89/shr (+68.27%) vs S&P 500 (+37.67%)

05/13/2020: $84.18/shr (+78%) vs S&P 500 (+35.40%)

Average gain since first JPM buy: +67.48% vs  S&P500's +41.46%

This is discounting the ~4% dividend yield during my buys. I do this with a lot of stocks and it's been working for me since the beginning of this bull market. The market seems to overreact in the short term and in the long term reprices accordingly. That overreaction is where an opportunity presents if you are a buyer. 

My portfolio is split between index funds (33% retirement), growth stocks (~30%) that are super volatile, low to slow growing stocks (%30%) that chugg along and 5% to 10% in bonds that act as dry powder for major corrections. The growth stocks lift the portfolio, the index funds and low volatility stocks provide stability. The bond allocation doesn't do much but neither does it drag the portfolio as the growth component makes up for it.",programmingguy,2,/r/investing/comments/lpot6m/lets_discuss_what_people_mean_when_they_say_buy/gocmpvw/,0.024,0.867,0.109,0.9673

77,PSTH," All stocks dip.  Look at any chart over any period of time and stock prices never go straight up.  It is natural for all stocks to pull back, or ""dip"".  When a stock price goes down, and you believe in the company, then it is an opportunity to buy more, especially if the price is below what you've already bought in at.  This is called averaging down and it reduces your overall cost basis on your position.  Bitcoin is a horrible example as it does not move in any way like a normal stock.  I bought PSTH for $30/share, it rose to $35/share and stayed there for a while, then dipped down to $29/share and I bought 200 more shares.  This reduced my cost basis in the position to $29.50.  It is now back up to around $30/share so I'm now in green where I would've been flat before.  And when it goes up I have 400 shares to ride instead of 200.  Basically dips are like flash sales in retail, while supplies last!

82,PSTH," So is ""buying the dip"" really just a short term strategy then?

I would assume that you would hope that PSTH would be at $45+ a couple years from now.  If it's not, and instead it drops to $18, are you still going to be buying more or are you going to be questioning your investment analysis?  

If it is at $45+, then it is unlikely to drop back down to $29 (and if it does, you'd probably question your investment analysis).

84,VGAC," Excellent question.  Because this is a SPAC without a merger target, my investment is ""potentially"" long-term but currently considered short-term.  I will re-evaluate once they make the announcement.  For example, I owned VGAC, another SPAC, and they announced 23andMe as their merger target and I am not interested in owning that long-term, so I sold my position.  If they announce a target that I like, then yes I will buy more if it dropped down to $18 (although this SPAC is a $20 floor, so not likely to go that low, but I get your point/example).  I'm a believer that you should re-evaluate your investments constantly.  Things change and your outlook on a stock can change, too, and in those cases you wouldn't accumulate more on dips.  If it was at $45, then dropped to $38, that may be the ""dip"" that I buy more, assuming I still believe in the stock. When my stocks are in the red, I review every one of them that day to determine if there is a buying opportunity.  When my stocks are in the green, I rarely buy on those days.

85,GME," But this is my problem with the strategy.  In your two scenarios, the investor was ""right"" about the stock, but never bought because they tried to time the market.  If there was never a dip so you never bought, it means the price just kept going up.  In which case, never buying means you missed out on those gains.

Missing out on gains is fine.  I missed out by never buying GME.  But I also never did any research on GME.

If you research a stock, analyze it, make the determination that it's a buy, *and you're right about it* - those are your winners.  That's what you're trying to do.

88,IAC," Dating is a fantastic industry to be in. There’s constant churn in relationships (both new relationships starting and existing ones ending). 

I’ve been in Match for quite some time and doubled down with shares from the IAC spinoff (IAC typically spins its companies off and you as a shareholder get shares of the company that gets spun off in addition to keeping your IAC shares. IAC fully recovered in price and Match continues to march forward. In the case of Match, you received 2.15 shares per each IAC share owned (plus again, you kept your IAC shares), making it a fantastic investment for everyone who held on. As an aside, IAC’s next spinoff is Vimeo.)

As you mentioned, Match owns several other large dating sites and apps. Additionally, they recently invested in a South Korea based social media company, Hyperconnect, which should fit nicely into their existing portfolio.

Bumble just had their IPO and I started a small position in them to assess performance.

Bumble, although successful, is a one trick pony. No one would be surprised if Bumble evaporates by 2025. It’s mostly a less serious/younger persons app and we all know how that goes.

100,NAV," > If this is the case, why would anyone still holds bond instead of saving as cash.

Bonds yield more than cash, and interest rates can go down, driving NAV up. A year ago, EDV (long-dated Treasuries) took off while stocks crash, going up 20% at one point while stocks were down. That provided a great rebalancing opportunity to buy stocks low. Now EDV is back where it was a year ago and people fear another crash is coming. EDV could easily rocket back up again if that happens. If you're just talking about holding bonds (not rebalancing) I suggest looking into [Series I savings bonds](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/i3w6zj/suggestion_now_is_a_good_time_probably_the_best/) (track inflation, very flexible, etc...).",misnamed,7,/r/investing/comments/lp78nj/bonds_index_vs_cash_on_interest_rate_near_0/goa1mzc/,0.088,0.792,0.12,0.5849
101,IMO," With interest rates at 0, you are asking a valid question. At least for nominal bonds and not inflation protected ones.

IMO, nominal bonds have mostly if not completely lost their diversifying effect after rates get cut to 0. With the major exception of China where there is still some yield. It's theoretically possible for the Fed to cut rates below 0, pushing up the value of bonds currently yielding 0 or 2%, but I think at this point that is more speculation than investing.

I don't think holding long dated bonds helps diversify equity risk anymore until the 0 yield world changes and investors should come up with alternatives.

129,DD,"  Just wanted to hear your thoughts on Affirm.

The share price was inflated after its IPO but that is to be expected in the current environment and hype. I got in at a fairly good share price and am thinking about buying more. What do you think?

I will not go ahead and repeat what I have read from various analysts and I am afraid my DD skills are far from proficient at this point. For me the dip in price occurred due to overly big expectations, but the solidly beat all projected earnings by analysts.

I personally think the business idea that is aiming to take a chunk of the credit card market is worth while, plus their partnership with shopify and goals for global expansion should be great growth opportunities.

137,GM," I've heard/read about semiconductor shortages that are allegedly going to severely hamper production of automobiles. But, best I can tell this hasn't been priced into stocks like F and GM. 

I think GM has great [very] long term potential based on their commitment to EVs and innovation, but not so sure about Ford. 

If production takes a hit and is reflected in the next 1 or 2 earnings reports, what play now has the best chance of the highest ROI? 

Full disclosure: I've never traded options (created an Investopedia account to get a fake portfolio to try it out, but still pretty clueless) and have never shorted stocks. As a matter of fact, I've really only ever bought and held stocks and haven't even tried strategies to alter positions, etc. beyond buying more stocks in different industries/geolocales.

That doesn't mean continual upside, though. ICLN had an RSI into the 90's in mid-January, which is massively overbought/overcrowded. There was some selling after that and now there seems to be some selling of what worked last year and buying of what didn't. Additionally, tons of people buying in January - the buying of something like ICLN should have been around the election, not waiting until in office.

For all the enthusiasm on this sub over the last month over clean energy, I'm seeing people ask should I sell?

235,UK," See [this post I made on this topic recently](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/llr1yi/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gns1b5g/):

>An [oft-cited Vanguard study](http://www.smartretirement.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/7.23.2012_Dollar-cost_Averaging.pdf) found that on average, across various countries (US, UK, and Australia) and time periods (1926-2011 in US, 1976-2011 in UK, 1985-2011 in AUS) lump-sum investing a block of cash saw better returns than dollar-cost averaging it in over the course of a year (in a particular portfolio: 60% local stocks, 40% local bonds) about 2/3rds of the time. Thus, on the assumption that we retail investors can't time the market (so any attempt to guess at ""But THIS time we're in the 33% bucket!"" is a fools' errand), I generally just play the numbers: lump-sum does better than DCA 2/3 times, so invest my investable dollars as soon as I get them. 

>On the other hand, that same study only saw lump-sum beating DCA by an average of around 2% (2.3% for US, 2.2% UK, 1.3% AUS) after 10 years. That particular 2% number is specific to all the variables of that study (the country, the time period, and the portfolio), but demonstrates a basic qualitative point: although lump-sum seems to historically beat DCA, it's not by a *huge* margin. So, if you think you'll see a psychological benefit from DCA'ing, that may be worth an anticipated couple percent underperformance.

In brief: at least historically, you've generally, on average, seen better returns investing in a lump sum vs. stretching that sum out over a year (admittedly that study looked at one particular portfolio construction, so YMMV). This makes some inherent sense: if you think the market will go up overall (you're investing in it, after all!) but don't know the specifics of how it will move short term (if you could accurately predict that you'd be rich!), you generally just want your money in as soon as possible so it's in the market as long as possible. However, it's not a massive difference either way.",throwawayinvestacct,2,/r/investing/comments/lpke2t/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/goci64m/,0.019,0.914,0.067,0.9235

Some general tips I can give:

&#x200B;

If something is up 15% in 1 day, don't buy it the next day or that day, wait for it to drop like 7% and if you feel really confident it's going to go higher buy it.

&#x200B;

Find a stock you really like and that makes you ""feel good"" and put most of your money into that, in that case if it goes down you can just buy more and see it as a ""discount"". Trust me with random stocks you hold for profit you don't do this.

While it is in writing, it is a legally enforceable protocol but you can only enforce it legally by going to court and that in itself shows a serious break in your working together.  

I just went through a purchase in the US of a small business buying a portion or % of stocks of a company.  Just working with the attorney for review of the Purchase agreement and refining the OA (that my now business partner provided and he paid an attorney to do) cost me about $$1800.

I like the CEO and the current leadership, although I only read transcripts, so I don‘t know how he „sounds“. They seem the right people for the job.

I like that TEVA is    growing in the biosimilars field and has other non-generic products.

This is the problem with TSLA (which I firmly believe is a bubble stock, if that even needs said).

282,GME," I am not saying that Burry is right, but you don't give a single reason why he is and here you are wrong.

&#x200B;

1. His Hedge Fund was nearly bankrupted because a lot of his clients withdrew their money. He underperformed due to his investment into CDS.  After that he posted a 489% increase in 2008.
2. Nothing to do with luck. He made great gain in 2001 and 2002 as well when the S&P 500 was negative. I think he would have been known in investment circles even without his great 2008 investment.
3. He bought most of GME in late 2019/early 2020 where the price hovered around 4$. He sold all of it in Q4 of 2020, where the price was around 15$. That is nearly a 4x increase in less than a year. I don't know in which bubble you are living in, but 4x on an investment in a year is tremendous. Yes he might have made more staying invested in it, but it was not a given that the short squeeze would happen.
4. Shorted Tesla. Yea, why not. Tesla's valuation makes no sense no matter how you look at it. Add the recalls, and increased competition and it makes even less sense. Let's see in 3 years if he was right about Tesla.
5. He is an active investor, so given his bias I wouln't count it against him that he talks about an index bubble -  and chances are high that prices are inflated due to many passive investors.
6. How do you know Hyperinflation won't happen in the US? Any proper reasons, historical examples or number that you can back it up? He brings the Weimar Republic as an example because they had to print money to pay for the war, and the US currently prints a lot of money to pay for stimulus/debt.",RoPrime12,20,/r/investing/comments/lph1q8/why_michael_burry_is_wrong/gobnj4a/,0.073,0.796,0.131,0.9648

288,USA," The USA had inflation of greater than 10% for a few years back in the 70's. It was caused by a bunch of issues all culminating together - nixon had interfered with the Fed's operations, and made them not raise interest rates when it was needed (so he could win his 2nd term election on the back of good employment numbers). This caused the precursor to the on coming inflation - triggered by the oil crisis (with oil price spike up causing input-inflation). 

Once rates rose in response, it cooled off fine, and has been on a downtrend ever-since.

For the USA to reach the level of hyperinflation that you see in venezuela or zimbabwe, the USA has to lose a lot of productive capacity (let's say, by war), or print 100x more money than they already have (and even at 100x, it would not trigger the venezuela style inflation, it'd have to be 100x every month!).
