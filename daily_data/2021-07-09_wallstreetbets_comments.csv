If you are buying a call and selling it before expiry or it expires outside the money, you aren't risking anything more than the premium which is the price of the option x100 for each option you buy. Say you want to buy 1 option contract to get started and it cost .50 that will cost you 50$ and your only risk is that 50$.

-This shouldn't be flaired as TA. TA doesn't give a fuck about value calculations, it plays on cyclical patterns observed in charts and the perfect market hypothesis

-DCF alone is a bad valuation tool. It's a good reality check in combination with other things, but requires a LOT of assumptions on how the company's money grows over time. China could boost shipping costs to the US and WISHs profit margins would tank immediately.

-No catalyst is presented. Why is this going to move on the near enough term that WSB would care about this? If I want an investment that'll double in 10 years I'll go read r/investing.

415,SPCE," SPCE DD - not financial advice

SPCE can have an additional 5 locations globally by 2026. Three locations already in negotiation. Colglazier is looking to expand globally. At 400 flights per year, with 4 spacecraft per location, at $600k per seat (this years price paid by Italian Airforce). This would make VG an $8+bn /year stock, with a very high profit margin, close to half their revenue even after capital expenditure. This will make the stock worth around $350-700 at a typical high growth P/E multiple between 20-40x. This doesn't even include supplementary income from hypersonic flight, on site entertainment, etc.

VG have 1 operational SS2 spacecraft, 1 SS3 in fit out, 2 SS3s in production ready for 2022. They will soon be turning a profit. They currently have no debt and burn only $240m per year, and can generate $1.4bn per year at full capacity ($600k per seat).

Makes a share price today of $50-70 a bargain, to get in at the ground floor of the first commercial space line approved by the FAA. Momentum and FOMO following the big weekend launch could easily make this spike to $70-80 next week.

If they are fully operational by 2023 at just one location. Today's share price is only a 16x multiple based on 50% profit margin. So it's worth up to 3 times it's current value for a high growth stock. Takes it above $100 today if you project revenue forward just 2 years.

Latest analyst forecast 2 days ago, gave a $51 target, which seems conservative given the above. Still today the shares are still cheap and relatively undervalued, imo.

423,SPCE," Some info for those apes who don't know SPCE that well.

When VG say they are testing, they are no longer testing the spacecraft. That has already been certified by the FAA for passenger travel. This weekend's test is mainly the customer experience in the cabin. They have also combined 2 cabin test flight's into this one, including Branson.

Combining tests means after this flight, they will have a Italian Airforce astronaut training flight in Aug/Sept, which is a VG's first full commercial revenue generating flight at c$600k per person. They call this a test but again is just checking how to deliver training as a customer experience.

So this Sunday is more like a commercial launch. The spacecraft is proven. Hence there is about greater than 99% chance of launch success this weekend. The weather remains clear for Sunday morning. They can launch anytime in a clear window since there is no countdown with a launch from a jet based mothership. Branson would not be flying if this was not a complete go situation. 

Still nothing is 100% safe, but a rocket plane is statistically safer than a large booster rocket. Remember Space X had two failed commercial rockets in 2015/16 which were on their way to re-supply the ISS. Safety is paramount at Virgin hence why it took so long to get here through much testing and improvement. 

Looking forward to a great live stream event on Sunday!

28% short volume yesterday.  Figure most covered intraday, thus the leg up after $50, but some would have remained open.  What did remain open, if unhedged, is in a bad spot.

Which means SPCE might dip in the AM with a steady rebound the rest of the day.

Not only am I extensively trained in pumping and dumping, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the SEC and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable portfolio off the face of robinhood, you little shit.

764,SPCE," It won't be SPCE with the breakthrough though. They have zero technology in their vehicle that's transferable to high speed mass transport. Hey have a simple gimmick which works because the challenge is to have a booster boost you for merely seconds before turning into a glider. Which is fine if you want to glide up and down to and from space close to where you launched. 

Verdict: If you want to go to India, nothing in this plane(s) will help you revolutionize your approach to that. Composites are figured out by now by everyone. And a hybrid rocket motor sure has his use cases. It's is not in mass transport. Once the (or any other) big ship is flying this turns into a dumpster fire because it won't be the most exclusive option anymore.

&#x200B;

If I look at SPCE I see three competencies:

a: building a suborbital composite airframe 

b: building a hybrid rocket engine 

c: creating procedures to safely and repeatedly execute a commercial spaceflight with this one particular vehicle

&#x200B;

My position:

a: can be done by many 

b: is a relatively new technologie with its pros. verdict about the usefulness of 3d printed rocket engines is still out, could turn the whole (small) market upside down, bring in new players and make this rather insignificant new propulsion feature irrelevant. Also, Raptor. If there is one engine good for mass transport for a variety of reasons, its this. still rather unlikely it flies ever point to point. Or even ever. I dont know. But if you aim too low you'll never hit. SPCE=Space Balenciaga. Now stone me

c: is a very particular skill, hard to earn, very hard to transfer over to another vehicle.

BABA and other China stocks definitely carry a lot risk, no doubt about it. But I still think the time to buy is now - there‚Äôs blood on the streets. And BABA is still especially bloody today (although 24hrs ago would have been even better).

I‚Äôm glad to hear that the Chinese were kicked off of base all those years ago. I‚Äôm one of the guys who watches out for that stuff now.
