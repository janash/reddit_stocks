This post is actually really dumb. That advice section at the end especially. Every point you make contradicts the one before it.

You say to not trade on any news that will affect the industry, or to trade on any expected news that will affect the stock. However, your last major point is SELL THE NEWS. Which one is it? Should I not pay attention to what you call fake pump-and-dump tactics or should I trade on news? You contradict yourself.

Furthermore, if your point is that this ‚Äúnews‚Äù is artificial and doesn‚Äôt actually pertain to the value of a stock, then why is one of your points at the end that ‚Äúyou MUST stay current‚Äù on a stock you have bought, and that ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt just buy and forget about it‚Äù??? Wouldn‚Äôt long-term holding with a disregard to price fluctuations be the best way to counter the artificial mini pump and dumps you are describing?

I have a son and if I die and the stock stays there, the money will be there, weather there is an AMC squeeze or not!.  The money is there, invested and my son can cash out when ever he wants.  It is owning a bit of the company, it is being a part of something.  The company weather it is in debt or not, it could and can come out of debt.  We know nothing of the future.  So, if the stock does happen to have a short squeeze, I'll be in the money either way.  I don't see the company going bankrupt after all this.  So I'll hold till I die.

* 49% Short Interest with 100% utilization and super high costs to borrow according to ORTEX (6/21). This is somehow fucking increasing, wtf!
* 100/100 Squeeze Score from S3 (Ihor)
* $720,000,000 in cash, no debt
* No threat of stock dilutions or market offering
* Insider's can't sell stock unless stock is >$30 for 90 days
* 45.6% increase in revenue 2020 over 2019  
Net loss $91.6m (2020) vs $363.7m (2019)  
Projected revenue 2021 $810-$830m vs $672m 2020 revenue and $462m 2019 revenue.
* Citadel owns 7x more AMC than CLOV, they take positions in stocks they short as a hedge or secret final weapon.
* Machine Learning AI Assistant for doctors and works with Medicare (growth market)
* Victim of hit piece from shorting hedge fund FUD Hindenburg (same people who slandered DKNG falsely in laughable reports), DOJ investigation from months ago hasn't gone anywhere
* Let's be real, high org ownership is actually kind of good for this squeeze, they're far more diamond handed than day traders or brand new apes.
* Last run up was from $10 to almost $30 - only 5% of shorts covered! For a 3x return we only had 5% cover. Imagine if we forced them all to cover. They've only seen a FRACTION of our POWER.

This is a fundamentally sound business using machine learning and AI to help docs make smart decisions with patient care. This both increases the quality of care and reduces cost of care, something our country desperately needs. Be a patriot, consider CLOV!

Tilray's original float was \~95 Million and they had issued \~ 40 million shares. So you are somewhat correct but it's not *as* big of an influence because the majority of the reason for changes in market cap are the Aprhia merger. You can compare the market cap from 3 years ago to now, but you can also compare the Price/Sales ratio (or any ratio) which they valued Tilray at. For ex. when Tilray was 40 and they had an 80 target they were suggesting an appropriate P/S was well over 100, but now they are suggesting a fair P/S is less than 20.

1709,CLNE," It could be a few things. 
I am guessing the Op could have purchased these much earlier at a lower option price. Option prices go up with the price of the underlying security (CLNE) and volume.  As the expiration date nears, the price of the option will be closer aligned to the price of the stock and the time/value will decrease. 
Because the volatility and volume of CLNE is high, the cost of the options is higher so long as there is time left before expiration if out of the money. 
I hope this helps and did not cause more confusion.",ConstitutionlPatriot,5,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o4j6h0/losses_on_clne_where_to_next/h2hm5fr/,0.021,0.88,0.099,0.8023
1710,TD," So the price you pay is just for the call (or put) option.  That is the option to purchase the stock at that strike price. So, if the option is 1.80 and the strike is $10, you have paid $180 ($1.80 x 100) for the privilege to buy the stock at $10. For you to make money, the stock would have to be at $11.80 at expiration.  

The price for an option will always be AT LEAST  the strike price plus any gains the underlying security has over the strike price.   For instance, say there is an option that expires this week with a $10 strike price and the stock is trading at $12.00. The option price will be higher than $2.00. 
EDIT:  I have seen some stock options that are deep in the money having a very minor discount if purchased then executed. One would have to take into account brokerage fees for both buying the option then executing it to see if it is worth it. 

Most people sell their options prior to expiration and do not execute the purchase. One reason may be capital.  One option contract is for 100 shares, so a stock strike price of $50 would cost $5,000 to execute the buy. 

TD Ameritrade has some free videos that explain option trading. You can also practice with a 'paper' account and see how they work.

DLSS is NOT Open

In summary: **DLSS is NOT**",MrObviouslyRight,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o52lqs/amd_already_beyond_the_galaxy_and_google_is/h2kq0tt/,0.043,0.957,0.0,-0.4973
1829,AMD," Xilinx was announced last year. It will complete this year. AMD was at $99 a couple of months back. But it has been trading sideways, consolidating a new base.

Now, with the recent clients, events, products, technologies, it is expected to breakout once again. The consensus analysts target for year-end is $110, although I expect it to be $130.

The revenue growth for 2021 was adjusted in April, after the $110 target price was reached.

To summarize, it will go up with or without Xilinx.",MrObviouslyRight,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o52lqs/amd_already_beyond_the_galaxy_and_google_is/h2kvmq9/,0.0,0.941,0.059,0.6124
1830,GPP," DLSS is yet another of NVIDIA's attempt to create a niche market for consumer abuse and anti-competitive practices.

They did it with G-Sync, charging stupid prices for Monitors.... but lost.

They tried it with GeForce Partnership Program (GPP), which was flat out criminal

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeForce\_Partner\_Program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeForce_Partner_Program)

So yeah, now they created some fancy sounding closed software (DLSS) while attempting to charge ridiculous prices for their GPUs.

Unreal Engine's Lumen and Nanite on UE5 (one of the 44 studios supporting AMD's Fidelity FX Super Resolution) has already made ray tracing possible in a much more convenient process. So yeah, DLSS will fade away, just like G-Sync and GPP.

Foreclosures before the pandemic were at all time lows.  So we will be coming up from those, but probably not past (or far past) normal rates.

Why do I think this:  a lot of forbearances end in the skipped payments simply being added on to the end of the mortgage, so many will not be facing a giant bill when the program ends.  Many who do have foreclosure actions taken against them will be able to sell their homes before they lose them.

Lets say you start with $1000 and traded 50 stocks and made $1000 (total $2000 in your account).

Then with your $2000, you YOLO'd into a meme stonk and sell with weak hands and lose $1800. Now you have $200 in your account

At the end of the year, your capital loss is ($800)
