0,SENS,"I bought the dip. Here was my thinking: SENS went up to $3.50 due to hype and that press release about the insurance company covering the device. More insurance companies are likely to announce they are covering the device soon, so it will probably pop back up again, at least to $3. I figured that anything below $2.40 was a steal since it had dipped in premarket and hadn't broken $2.40, so I bought more shares when it hit $2.39. Then it dipped more and I figured, hell I liked it at $2.39, what's wrong with it at $2.25? Then it dipped a bit more to $2.20, and I have a limit buy order in for $2.19, so I was hoping it dipped 1 more cent but it didn't.  Setting a limit buy order below the current price helps emotionally in this case because you win no matter which way the stock moves.

Looks like it's back down to the $2.40's now, so you all might have another chance soon!",0.055,0.813,0.131,0.9101

Slowly grow your portfolio, learning when to enter and exit. If a stock has already gone up 30%+ within a week, it's probably not the right time to buy.

My take on it is, once you grow your account up to 25k you're probably knowledgeable enough to handle riskier bets, like hopping into a stock up 80% but knowing to leave asap if it drops or knowing  that 5% profit is still excellent. 

Imo, and btw I started my brokerage account with 5k, once you've gotten that far you'll be glad to know how to do your own dd.
