0,SENS,"I bought the dip. Here was my thinking: SENS went up to $3.50 due to hype and that press release about the insurance company covering the device. More insurance companies are likely to announce they are covering the device soon, so it will probably pop back up again, at least to $3. I figured that anything below $2.40 was a steal since it had dipped in premarket and hadn't broken $2.40, so I bought more shares when it hit $2.39. Then it dipped more and I figured, hell I liked it at $2.39, what's wrong with it at $2.25? Then it dipped a bit more to $2.20, and I have a limit buy order in for $2.19, so I was hoping it dipped 1 more cent but it didn't.  Setting a limit buy order below the current price helps emotionally in this case because you win no matter which way the stock moves.

Looks like it's back down to the $2.40's now, so you all might have another chance soon!",0.055,0.813,0.131,0.9101

You are correct, the rule was created to protect brokerages and was meant to encourage Investing. You may be an experienced trader, but that doesn't mean everyone else is and if it weren't for the pdtr  people would be hurt worse, it teaches patience and discipline. 

There's definitely a lot more traders than there was back then. I think if you were to give a bunch of inexperienced traders the opportunity to trade freely there would be a lot of stocks tanking and or rising for absolutely no reason.

Slowly grow your portfolio, learning when to enter and exit. If a stock has already gone up 30%+ within a week, it's probably not the right time to buy.

My take on it is, once you grow your account up to 25k you're probably knowledgeable enough to handle riskier bets, like hopping into a stock up 80% but knowing to leave asap if it drops or knowing  that 5% profit is still excellent.

(MAYBE Biden will be good for nuclear, but he’s trying to push primarily towards solar, wind, and hydro, which will most likely (economically) fail, maybe giving them the idea to push the agenda on nuclear power in let’s say 1-2 years depending on how fast he realizes buying billions of dollars of solar panels (who’s yearly energy output is fractional to a nuclear power plants’ 24 hour output).
