0,USA," Avoid cap weighting.  For example Schwab has passive funds based on fundamental weighting which corrects for a lot of problems with cap weighting.  DFA core funds can play a similar role (Advantis offers similar products and not that John Hancock has sector funds run by DFA).

4,IMO," Modern portfolio theory achieves diversification across two main asset classes, bonds and equities. Within the category of equities, further diversification is achieved through holding potentially thousands of companies across all market sectors, large and small caps, as well as emerging markets and just global companies rather than just looking at home country bias.

Big picture look is that those bonds and equities are supposed to be uncorrelated asset classes, and in the event of a crash, rising bonds will help offset the losses from equities and you just rebalance.

What can you do if Burry is right about the passive bubble? Invest in other, truly uncorrelated asset classes.

Chiefly I would suggest long volatility and gold. I haven't figured out how to optimally express long volatility without killing myself on the carry as a retail investor.

You should consider looking at some terrific interviews and research papers by Chris Cole of Artemis capital, and his Dragon portfolio.

7,BIG," While it is true that index funds put money into all underlying stocks, the distribution is weighted though. I am not sure how weight of a stock in SPY is being calculated but majority of it is going into BIG companies. The proportion of money being put into smaller companies that might not be doing well but still performing well on stock market is very small. Basically, even if SPY has some bubble stocks, they are a very small proportion. I am going to write that off as a ""fee"" for owning the asset. So if I put in $100 in SPY, may be only $97.5 is going to non-bubble stocks.

11,AAPL," I think in a way you answered your own question to an extent. You stated “Index funds will go down when their underlying holdings go down” which is true. Index funds also go up when their underlying holdings go up. Buying an ETF is awesome, you buy a piece of several different companies at once, and don’t have to worry about rebalancing and diversifying (as much). Some of the simplest and “best” financial advice now is “Buy an index fund and forget about it! People barely beat the market.” So people started doing it. It’s one of the best things to do historically. So now people buy ETFs, and those ETFs purchase those underlying assets. And I think what they’re saying is that people are buying ETFs just for the sake of buying an ETF, they’re really not sure how valuable those assets underneath are. So that leads to companies that are included in ETFs to be artificially inflated. For example, let’s say the only index fund to exist is the sp500. Because of this ETF buying the sp500 P/E ratio of underlying assets would be 50. Meanwhile, the P/E ratio of all other stocks not in the sp500 would be 30. The numbers used are made up just to give an example.     

So in theory ETF buying is pumping up the equity values that are held in ETFs, while stocks that aren’t in ETFs are missing out. 3 of the 4 biggest ETFs track the sp500, which comes to a combined AUM of 865 Billion. However, the counter argument is if this is true (equities are overvalued that are in ETFs), to what extent does it affect the equity values? There are many ETFS, large cap, small cap, bonds, growth, value, momentum, industry specific, etc. It seems any stock is placed in some sort of ETF. Also going back to the 3/4 biggest ETFs tracking the sp500, it’s weighted by market cap, and the biggest companies such as AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, GOOG, and FB have been extremely well. So while I see the argument that index funds may be overbought and pumping up the underlying equity values, specifically the SP500, those 5 companies along with Berkshire are weighted at about 20% of the index.

16,TSLA," Yep!  You're absolutely correct.

If everyone buys index funds then they're buying both bad and good stock.  This gives an opportunity for value investors but in a different than historical way.  Historically value investing is finding undervalued companies and then hopefully in the future their price rises to reflects their true value, à la Warren Buffet style investing.  But with everything being bought up by index funds, there are no longer low priced stocks.  Instead you have to look for normal value where you think the company in the future will exceed its current value and blow up.  Eg, buying TSLA years ago when it had a normal value.  (If you're buying during it's price rise it's growth investing not value investing.)

17,DD," Exactly, it is a Nash equilibrium. Concretely, it is a Nash equilibrium in mixed strategies.

If everyone except yourself invested passively, it would be best to invest active (you basically decide what the others will buy just by purchasing it). On the other hand, if everyone investe actively, you are probably best off passively following them, this is what the Bogleheads preach.
Now, as both strategies are superior when played against the other one, there is a Nash equilibrium in mixed strategies.
So much for the theory. In reality, especially in a multi million player game without perfect information and some irrational behavior, we don't actually reach a perfect Nash equilibrium but instead hover around it. 

The only hard part is to decide which strategy is superior right now. In my opinion, Burry is right. The indices are in a bubble and it will eventually pop. Now what to do? Don't buy overpriced companies. Research, do your DD, and you will find fairly valued companies.

24,GE," Those superstars that drive the fund's performance aren't static.

The point of buying the fund is that you most likely aren't going to be picking the right stocks, so you get to benefit from the rising superstars as they come up and the ETF will naturally rebalance itself to give you more exposure to better performing companies and less exposure to companies trending down. As long as the market in general continues to trend upwards they'll be okay.

32,CAT," I don't believe it is necessary for passive indexing to influence prices for active strategies to become superior. My example at the beginning was just to proof that at some point the passive strategy will definitely be dominated, but it might be much sooner.

My conclusion is based on the PE of the S&P as well as my growth estimations. More precisely, the data points for some of the companies in it. And I don't only refer to Tesla.

33,MCD," I don't believe it is necessary for passive indexing to influence prices for active strategies to become superior. My example at the beginning was just to proof that at some point the passive strategy will definitely be dominated, but it might be much sooner.

My conclusion is based on the PE of the S&P as well as my growth estimations. More precisely, the data points for some of the companies in it. And I don't only refer to Tesla.

34,GOOG," I'm jumping in here to try to throw the topic back on track. It's not so much a reply only to so much as the posts above as well.

I'll say we're all mostly in agreement about the unlikelihood of meltdown because boomers retiring. However, I will say that MB isn't wrong in that the index funds have all the right features of a bubble or to form a bubble:

* General lack of understand of the underlying investment. And the investors actively being ignorant to it.

* The general push of funds into said investment.

* The general mentality of ""Just keep putting money in. It only goes up in the long run. And whatever dips will be gone in a few years. Even if you bought the top"" This probably the most important part. I remember this was literally the mentality of real estate investing prior to the 07 crash. 

MB (and trad economist) note that it's usually leverage and pumping that causes bubbles. Which I also believe could be true as well. People might be more willing to buy more and more into VOO than even the best stock because the diversification reduces risk. Someone who won't buy GOOG on margin might feel safe enough to do it for the SPY.

I think the big index funds are more likely to create larger swings than actually be the bubble themselves. They allow people to buy in easily, have stronger faith in the safer asset class and use leverage, and finally easily pull out when they think things are going down. Index funds will add upward push to the stocks and market when going up and will add additional downward pressure when markets go down much like leverage.",zxc123zxc123,23,/r/investing/comments/nf5rgc/if_burry_is_right_about_the_index_fund_bubble/gylm4k1/,0.036,0.81,0.154,0.986

47,USA," This is such a great question.

Let me give you a real personal example. I was professional poker player. When i played first million hands online in new game format, I could 95 % guarantee next million of hands I will have same profitability. After first 50k hands i could estimate with 80% how much profitability will have. 

However in last years, players field got suddenly so competitive. Every million hand I made less money. My profitability went down. Top earners start to earn less. My game has not change, but everyone got so solid. Reality has change. 

USA will not have same macro - financial reality as last 100 years. Think of 1918 how much of potencial USA had. Or in 1945. So much technological edge, Britain being bankrupt, Germans down, half of world with Russians in communism. USA had half of world gdp. 

You think USA has same potencial growth in 2021 as in 1918 or in 1945. You think Chinese are not competitors? 

Japan is great technological coutry, but never fully recovered from 1990 bubble . Their PE ratio was 90 for god sake. Like Michael Burry says big bubble = long recovery 

Great Britain, once a mighty empire has low stock returns in last 30 years. In 19 century they had such a bubble they banned trading for 40 years or what.

52,UK," You'd be wrong on that point.

The more time you take to DCA, the more cash drag affects your returns. If you invest all of your money at once, you are 100% exposed and your performance will mirror the stock market.

The average direction of the returns of the stock market is positive, which means you miss out on gains on average.

DCA of 1 year adds an annual underperformance of 0.38%. Basically an MER of 0.38% for an ""active"" strategy.

Ben Felix released a paper if you want to see more.

https://www.pwlcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Dollar-Cost-Averaging-vs-Lump-Sum-Investing.pdf

https://rationalreminder.ca/podcast/101

He also explained it in one of his podcasts. Timestamp at 31:49. The 0.38% number is at timestamp 38:32.

By not having all of your money tied to the stock market at T+0, you aren't efficiently capturing the rise of the market as a whole. This results in underperformance of your portfolio compared to the market.

He looked at 10-year rolling periods (Jan 1970 - Jan 1980, Feb 1970 - Feb 1980, etc), individually in Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, UK, and the US, of 100% equity portfolios. DCA was done with $1 million over 12 months.

On average, the annual growth of the DCA portfolio trailed the lump sum portfolio by 0.38%.

It does have a lot of competition and from what I can see at a birds eye view fubo isn’t differentiated enough to compete long term and keep subscribers. Again I’m open to some info to the contrary.

25 Years Old, UK.  
  
Employed making 32k a year.  
  
Want to Invest savings that I hold and will add more savings monthly too. That will be used towards retirement and to provide a more passive income.  
  
20-40 years. Possible dabble in short term high risk when more experienced.   
  


Medium Risk - if long term investing maybe more into high Risk  
  
No assets or holdings, really new to this. Finding it hard to find info that is not clickbait or adverts for sites.  
  
Mortage on house I live in.   
  
Main issue at the moment before I start looking at my portfolio is what Site to use to start my investments. There are so many and most seem to have ads galore that its hard to tell legit from scam.

It is, but as something that's larger and profitable, that's likely to hold up mildly better/be less volatile than ""rapidly growing but unprofitable"" (which has done horribly this year.)

"" it just updates the software so people have to buy the subscription.""

I'm not familiar with ADSK products, but if there's a need for people in that industry to use the software/if it's the ""go to"" software, then there's some degree of consistency/stability in that.
