3,RH," My man I get it, you are clearly very passionate about this. 

What happened to Alex Kearns was absolutely tragic, full stop.

I (and I'm sure many others here) agree with you that RH sucks big fat balls and deserves to be harshly punished. We get people with your passionate point of view in this sub almost daily. I'll politely tell you the same thing I tell them.

All brokers offering ""commission free"" trading are guilty of the same unethical practice of selling order flow information to hedge funds. Robinhood is not a stock broker. It's a data company. Sure it facilitates trades, but users are the product. Same can be said for every broker offering commission free trades.",Itsboomhomie,11,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/ofva83/robinhood_sued_by_users_for_their_illegal/h4f1lr2/,0.09,0.77,0.14,0.759
4,SOL," Thank you and I apologize if I‚Äôve offended or ‚Äúovershared‚Äù üòÑ but I‚Äôve traded with Fidelity for 20 plus years and have never experienced anything like what Robinhood did to me personally. I lost a good chunk of money when they restricted the sell of shares I bought with them. When I called to complain and ask for compensation from their ‚Äúsell freeze,‚Äù they basically said sorry your SOL. Then I read so many others with similar experiences and they are being sued from all sides for this and other types of unethical, inaccurate or just simply lazy behavior. Again sorry for over sharing or repetitive data. I‚Äôm just very much on a personal position to help others avoid these same experiences.",Alternative_Power_87,7,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/ofva83/robinhood_sued_by_users_for_their_illegal/h4f2irn/,0.207,0.676,0.117,-0.896
