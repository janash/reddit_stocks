This is because everyone realized the internet would be the next big thing (like AI) but there are a lot of unknowns. Who will succeed, how profitable, etc. 

A company could come out tomorrow with a huge breakthrough in AI hardware or software, which I believe would cause many of the other companies to fall. Or there could be a few lackluster earnings reports, and many investors may lose patience and look to put their capital towards companies with better results, especially during a time of economic uncertainty. 

It’s difficult to price something that is almost completely unknown, so I suspect there will be wild price action for a while. You are best off DCA into Nasdaq if you believe in the future of AI as there is no way of knowing who will win/lose.

36,AI," It seems overvalued, but there's a potential huge upside - at some point truly exponential growth may set in, and to have stakes at AI companies at that point would be very profitable.

However, the longer this exponential growth is not visible, there's a risk of the bubble popping.

Currently the models are OK for generic tasks, but not that great for more specialised ones. I'd be interested to see how good would a potential model be at learning new information from e.g. company-specific internal data source (documentation, etc.). Of course information like that is minuscule in comparison to the datasets LLMs are normally trained on, and so potentially it might still not do that great.

Also there's an issue of accuracy - sure, the model may be impressive at times, but that doesn't account for much if you can't really trust it - there has to be a person fact-checking and overseeing the output anyway.

NVDA, for example, has a P/E ratio MUCH higher than MSFT. At the moment, most of their revenue comes from GPUs, which has been rapidly declining (they even saw their networking/data center revenue drop in the last qtr). So right now their projected revenue growth is centered around their AI chips. If they were to sell a million of these chips each year(which the average person /business doesn’t need in order to utilize AI) it would add 10b in revenue, which would be a 35% increase to current revenue. 

They would then have a few challenges to overcome to ensure they maintain this 35% increase. 

1 - They have to maintain their lead over other competitors to keep their overwhelming market share (I acknowledge they have a big lead at the moment). 

2 - They would need enough advancement in their chips each year, for everyone to justify replacing their chips every year. (The resale market on the old chips these companies are replacing will cut out of their potential revenues as well.)

3 - They have ongoing supply chain issues. They would need to ensure they are getting all of the required materials to make a million AI chips a year on top of all of the other tech they are producing. 

4 - Their market is already being limited - the US isn’t allowing them to sell any chips to China, unknown if other restrictions will follow. 

5 - The macroeconomic environment isn’t the best at the moment and innovation tends to come at a pretty high cost. 

6 - US/ China tensions over Taiwan have been escalating for a while now and Nvidia relies on Taiwan to manufacture their chips.

The examples you provided for using it to generate simple template code I'm aware of. I don't personally do it because it's really faster 90% of the time to grab it from google. I would not use it to validate sql (due to schemas being proprietary and also because SQL editors usually points you to where the issue is anyway). I think I can also find aws cli commands faster on google.

139,LNG," I think it's a fair critique as a 'capitalist.' A boom/bust cycle is not great when the underlying commodity or related infrastructure is critical for humanity's needs. We underbuild infrastructure like import/export terminals for LNG, crude oil refinery capacity; we wait to mine copper/rare earth metals until we really want them (and then we have to wait a decade for the market to respond); we don't bother diversifying oil and gas supply until it's too late and the Russians invaded. Or expansion of semiconductor manufacturing capacity.

I don't really care about a boom/bust cycle for automakers or precious metals. But strategic resources are a different matter and warrant state intervention to ensure a steady supply. Having half the industry go bankrupt or become wildly profitable can't be a sustainable strategy. I mean, you wouldn't want agriculture to be purely market driven; imagine if we just stopped producing food because it was temporarily not profitable!

However, this cyclicality at least provides a profitable investment strategy for those who are ready.",AP9384629344432,2,/r/stocks/comments/1288qre/copper_investors_are_demonstrating_the_bystander/jekvhkk/,0.083,0.754,0.163,0.9149
140,CG," You seem... confused.  

You're mixing tax advantages with market returns.  IRA, 401k, 403b, 457... Those are all tax advantaged accounts.  They can all be invested into markets and get market returns.

All else being equal, throwing money in a tax advantaged account rather than a brokerage with no tax advantages should come out ahead in the long term.  With traditional contributions, you pay less in taxes today, allowing you to throw more in, AND you don't pay CG taxes on that money.  With Roth, no immediate tax break, but no taxes on that money in the future, and again, no CG taxes.  Both of those are superior to a brokerage, where you don't get a tax break today and you don't get a tax break on the gains.  

Now once you've maxed out both IRA and 401k contributions for the year (~29,000 dollars), any *additional* money should get thrown into a brokerage, sure.  

It's worth noting that there are several ways to access money in tax advantaged accounts before retirement age.  Roth IRA contributions (but not gains) are accessible at any time.  You can also choose to pay the penalty, which is generally less than the amount saved on CG.  You can also set up something like Rule 72(t) SEPP to access money earlier.  

ALSO, Roth IRA has no RMDs in retirement -- you aren't forced to take money out unless you want to, which is a nice advantage.

So I guess the point is you aren't leaving non-retirement-account money sitting around as cash -- nobody is suggesting that.  If you've maxed out retirement account contributions, then absolutely throw any additional into a brokerage account and invest now.  And if in future years, you don't have the means to max out retirement accounts, you can always liquidate part of the brokerage balance to max out your retirement account contributions.

---

Given the scenario you presented, $100k at age 18, you'd aim to turn that money into tax-advantaged money over time:



* Throw $100k into brokerage
* Take $6,500 out and throw it into an IRA
* Set 401k contributions high enough to max out for the year.
* Consume some of the brokerage balance to live on if 401k contributions have made you too poor.
* In following years, repeat the process.

Whether you go for Roth or Traditional contributions to IRA and 401k mostly depends on income -- low income, Roth is generally preferable.  High income, Traditional might be preferable.  Very high income, might have to look into Backdoor Roth.  

In something like 4 years, all of the $100k would be tax advantaged in some form, and you've moved your retirement date much closer to present-day than those folks who didn't get $100k at age 18.

10% isn't a realistic number for long-term, after-inflation gains.  You're more likely looking at 5% over inflation.  Which would mean the real value of the money would double in 14 years or so.

Intelligent investor

One up on Wall Street

100 - Baggers

The little book that still beats the market

The Dhandho investor

You can be a stock market genius

Poor Charlie’s Almanac

The most important thing illuminated

Rich Dad Poor Dad

The little book of Valuation 

After that be wary of the Dunning Kruger effect and read some more.  Warren Buffets annual reports for Berkshire Hathaway are free on their website.  

After all, people forget that the only reason most of us work is so some day we don’t have to. Doesn’t it make sense to learn about what will make you more money than your vocation over your lifetime.

Vanguard ETFs are a great way to start.

For an individual stock I would look at STLA.  It’s the merger of Chrysler & PSA in Europe.  It’s the 4th largest car company.  Selling below book value.  P/B .7.  Has an 7.95% dividend.  ROE 26.08%.  49 billion in cash and only 27 billion in debt.  22 billion after paying off all debt is $9 a share in cash.  It’s trading at 18.19, so you get the company for about $9 after you take out the cash.  Oh and the PE is 3.13.  I don’t want to own a car company long term, but a double would be nice.  Morningstar has a price target of 41.

200,DRS," You can.. but you should also be aware of what they represented.  There is a digital equivalence of a physical paper stock now or ""paperless"" called DRS. Directly Registered Shares.. as in, these shares are directly registered in your name(like the old certificates). This means the shares are yours in your name and not held in your brokers name at the DTC(Deposit Clearing Corporation). You usually have to get these DRS from the company's transfer agent. Mine uses Computershare. This is a big deal for memestocks apes, for example, because they don't want their shares being lent or sold without their permission and they can keep better tabs on who owns what of the float. If they buy more than %100, DTC wouldn't be able to cover it up.   If your shares are held with a broker, and they default, like robinhood almost did during the memestock event, your assets, depending on what they are, may or may not be fdic insured for up to $250k. But if your shares are in your name or DRS, you don't have to worry about someone selling your shares without your permission. With DRS, the transfer agents just contract the trade out to brokers. You can order a paper physical certificate from transfer agents.. but I think I just learned today, that if a company opted out of physical issuance, the transfer agents will still print you one, but it's for show only. I really want to get certs of my memstocks and frame them though. So I've been looking into it. 
Hope this kinda helps. There's physical paper, but also know there's the financial product that those papers represent. If you want the paper, that's cool, but also know there is a very valid reason to want to own you shares in your own name or DRS. This can be done digital now.. or paperless, but it's different than ""owning"" shares at your broker. Your broker owns those shares. Your ownership is warehoused with them at DTC. It's kinda like the phrase.. ""not your keys, not your crypto."".. if it's not in your name.. its in somebody else's name.. your broker or whatever. I love DRS.

If they buy more than %100, DTC wouldn't be able to cover it up.   If your shares are held with a broker, and they default, like robinhood almost did during the memestock event, your assets, depending on what they are, may or may not be fdic insured for up to $250k. But if your shares are in your name or DRS, you don't have to worry about someone selling your shares without your permission. With DRS, the transfer agents just contract the trade out to brokers. You can order a paper physical certificate from transfer agents.. but I think I just learned today, that if a company opted out of physical issuance, the transfer agents will still print you one, but it's for show only. I really want to get certs of my memstocks and frame them though. So I've been looking into it. 
Hope this kinda helps. There's physical paper, but also know there's the financial product that those papers represent. If you want the paper, that's cool, but also know there is a very valid reason to want to own you shares in your own name or DRS. This can be done digital now.. or paperless, but it's different than ""owning"" shares at your broker. Your broker owns those shares. Your ownership is warehoused with them at DTC. It's kinda like the phrase.. ""not your keys, not your crypto."".. if it's not in your name.. its in somebody else's name.. your broker or whatever. I love DRS.

202,DTC," So great question.. and yes. A bunch of us are getting DRS(directly registered shares) with our company's transfer agent. It's a digital version of a paper stock but some will print copies if requested.  Your broker should be able to transfer any previous shares you own so you don't have to sell but they might also charge a fee. Also, transfer agents might have fees when you trade with them, but it's worth it to me to avoid the conflicts of interests with brokers and DTC and share lending ect..

203,DRS, Correct. Direct Registration is not a physical cert. most stocks don’t have physical certs anymore as Cede/DTCC has been digitalizing them all. DRS is just putting the shares directly in your name rather than beneficially owned through a brokerage.,UncleBenji,3,/r/stocks/comments/128d3ca/can_stocks_be_held_in_physical_form_instead_of/jejsi44/,0.0,0.862,0.138,0.6808

205,DRS, Dude.. brigading? This is a stocks sub. Stocks. He asked about physical shares and limiting conflicts of interest. I provided a decent answer. And you want to prevent him from learning because you don't like my stocks. Wtf is wrong you? Seriously. I mentioned apes because there are tons of posts about DRS if he wants to learn more. This is a stocks sub. I'm personally never using a broker again because they've screwed me multiple times.. as in .. lots of money.. conflict of interest. These things matter whether you like my stocks or not and I'm trying to help someone so brokers don't fek him like they feked me.

210,OP," Can’t imagine paying these prices for homes after buying homes for literally fraction of the cost at auctions.  I literally just sold 3 homes last year in the during the peak (or at least what I thought was the peak). 

VOO from my knowledge is vanguard’s version of spy??  If so, I am planning on putting some into spy and other etfs.  

What is this “freedom money” of which you speak??🤔

Ps: Love to rehab homes so that is still not written off, but just not at these prices.

213,ALL," You notice I didn’t post this on r/wallstreetbets.  Lol.  Jk. Jk. Though I bet they’re head and shoulders above my financial smarts. 

Up until now, it didn’t hurt having cash on the side and buying the homes cash at auctions and then rehabbing them without loans; however, the foreclosure/auction market is just ridiculous right now.  The kind of people bidding up the properties have no idea what they’re buying and the liability they’ll have after the Purchase, so I am out of the foreclosure market for now. 

I need to figure out how to invest wisely.  Although, I am not looking for a lottery, I do want a decent rate (which I believe should be around 7-9%, if I am not building any equity in the process). 

For ALL OF THE MISSED OPS (During the .com crash, GFC and a brief downturn during March 2020… where luckily I was able to get into great positions in energy/oils at really good prices) I believe there may be an opportunity around the corner that I do not want to miss.
