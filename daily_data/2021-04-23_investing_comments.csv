30,AMD," Certainly gets people in a much safer position than ignoring diversification. 

I'd say 25 gets people 95% of the way to being as diversified as the overall market. 12 stocks might be like 70% of the way there.

It also depends on investing strategy. If you're older and you only want dividend paying stocks that are large caps seeking income with short-term safety and less future gain, you can be well diversified for those types of companies by only paying attention to sector diversification of those types of stocks

However, if you're looking at high-growth tech companies where there are more risks and rewards, you might want to diversify within that portion of the market and across all sectors. These stocks are high innovation, but valuations price in future revenue growth. There is more lost when another company comes in with a slightly better innovation. A random short-term example is Intel disclosed weaker sales today and went down 5% and it sent AMD up 4% based on that alone.

I'm in AMD and I'm betting on them coming back and being an alternative to Intel again, even if they keep a smaller market share. But Intel could create a new innovation at any time in the future sending AMD down. I still want some high risk/reward growth, so I need to diversify that sector/type too.

You might want to have 5 or 6 high growth tech stocks alone, so it is more likely that one of your higher risks/rewards stocks make it big to counteract any that don't over time within that sector. Then you'd want 12 stocks that really spread you out across the whole market, while being sure not to ignore well-established value companies, industrials, and some good 'ol relatively recession safe-ish healthcare stocks.

96,AMD," Intel entering the discrete GPU space should not be news to anyone that ACTUALLY follows this stuff, so it's telling that your immediate response is ""lol you googled an article"".  Or is there actually something wrong with citing information?  


And Intel has GPUs.   They sell more than anyone else.  Their integrated GPUs are a giant portion of the market, so their transition to making discrete GPUs should not be crazy.  They also have their own supply of chips that isn't nearly as affected by the shortage as AMD and Nvidia, so they stand to capture as big a piece of the GPU market share as they are able to produce.  I'm betting they are able to release before 2022, it's understandable if you are more skeptical though.  


Even without the addition of discrete GPUs, due to the extreme shortage+demand at the moment, people are actively seeking out CPUs with integrated graphics in order to have working systems until supply for discrete GPUs is finally met.  AMD's integrated graphics options in the desktop market are not nearly as desirable - the SKUs are too low end for gamers or power users to use it as a viable upgrade path (buying a 3400g to hold you over until you can find a 3070 or 6700xt creates a CPU bottleneck, buying nearly any intel CPU with an iGPU avoids that scenario by being a way better CPU than the current AMD offerings)  


In any event, go ahead and hate on Intel if you want.  Analysts were already wrong once about their earnings, it won't be the first time.  Eventually the market will figure it out.",titeywitey,7,/r/investing/comments/mwimp5/intel_q1_earnings_call_summary/gvj0bcr/,0.071,0.869,0.06,-0.634

I an trying to get experience with options.  I just completed my first SALE this week of a covered option, but it didn't conclude the way I expected.

I purchased 100x SNDL at .8510, or $85.10

I sold a 0.50 covered call expiring today 4/23 .  The premium I collected was $35 dollars

The break even point of this option was 0.85

Sundial closed today at 0.8399 it appears like, and then immediately shot up to 0.855 at 4:05 after market.

Is my expectation correct, in that I normally wouldn't get assigned on the call.  The stock ended lower than break-even (once again, I sold the call).  Did the after market activity cause my assignment?

My partner is finishing grad school and will be making more money starting in June but we do not combine our finances and I'd like to purchase something alone.

I feel stupid for letting that money sit there but it took me all of my twenties to earn and its my entire life's savings.

There was a time that all the DJ components purposefully tried to keep their stock price within a certain range to be able to attract investors since trading costs were high and no one could own part of a share.

130,IMO," Congrats on taking steps early in your life to plan ahead!  you have a long time for the market to work in your favor.

You don't mention your own retirement in here anywhere, so I am hoping that you are already maximizing company match in 401K and/or have IRAs put aside for your own future... As important as your children are, your own retirement shouldn't get lost in the shuffle.

I also hope you also have an emergency fund that could cover all your expenses for 3-6 months right now.

All that said, we don't know what choices our children will make when they get there, and don't discount the idea that they will be resilient young adults at age 18 if you raise them right.  The risk of the 529 plans is that you are trading off some tax benefit, in return for locking up funds only to be used on education.  IMO we shouldn't be overfunding those things that lock up per child.  Better off to have money in other vehicles that can be shared appropriately at the time.  Many of the 529s have ""target date"" investments only so their return won't be stellar.  I also think College is changing and I don't think we will continue to see the completely insane cost growth rates that occurred over the past 20 years.  I did 529s for my two; for one we tapped additional out of taxable accounts (although he owed us the difference and is paying it off) and the other one (who has health issues too and can't deal with full time college) has excess we are trying to figure out what to do with; I overfunded it.  So don't overfund, because the only real benefit is tax mitigation.

My other suggestion is plan now and discuss with them early that they are partially on the hook for their education.  The more it is not just your problem, the surprisingly better choices they may make.  You actually have quite a long time to find that money, and if both of you grow in career, you will have more money to fund it out of.  start under $100 per person per month (you can grow this or not as your situation changes) 

TL;DR.  Put aside for yourselves first, kids second.  Don't overfund 529s, and make sure your retirement is funded now.  and also get taxable investments going too.  It's really ok if you need to tap taxable investments for large future expenses, and if you are smart with the money it is going to grow a lot more than the 529s will.

cheers!  future planning is something you are putting a lot more thought into than the average person your age!",LiqCourage,2,/r/investing/comments/mwr2lz/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gvktjgp/,0.016,0.882,0.102,0.9892

135,AMD," I avoided plug mostly because I don't see hydrogen fuel cells being the future. Green infrastructure already in place is basically everything but that. And you don't necessarily need to be the best, you just need to be first. So solar, wind, and hydro electric will probably win out (at least for my money).  I have a couple thousand spread across a few random green ETFs, but no single stock. 

I'm long on nvidia, AMD, and apple at the moment.  Especially AMD if you can get it at or below the $80 price point, they have chip sets in both next gen consoles, VASTLY outperform intel in both laptop and desktop chips, and there is word they are gaining ground in the data center sector as well. Generally in the world of CPU manufacturers intel and AMD trade blows and go through cycles where one manufacturer is dominant for a few years at a time. It seems as if this is the beginning of AMD's cycle, especially after the 11th gen intel chips were just released and were benchmarked *worse* than the 10th gens. 

As far as Nvidia, they just released the 30 series graphics cards and they are the HOTTEST commodity right now in the tech industry. They have some of the best raw power AND bang for the buck that PC builders look for, and frankly the performance jump compared to the previous generation is amazing. AMD happens to be their competition in the GPU market, so if you buy both you can hedge your bets some (but AMD is still CPU king so they should be fine even if NVIDIA is killing it with GPUs).

Biggest concerns/risks right off the bat I see are the fact that to some degree buying AMD and NVDA is a zero sum game since they compete with one another in the GPU market  (tho they don't in the CPU market, and frankly I'm okay with hedging as a form of safety). Also and perhaps the biggest risk (at least short term) is the silicon shortage. Nvidia and AMD both deal HEAVILY in silicon and in case you haven't heard that is hard to get right now. Worst estimates that I've heard place the shortage as being in effect until 2023 plus or minus. So if you are like me and looking to buy and hold for 5+ years as retirement or a down payment on a house then it's probably not an issue. But if this is a shorter term investment, then it is something to consider. 

I dunno if I covered everything (I left out stuff like financials since that's easy for any of us to just Google), but if you have any specific questions just ask. 

Of course all that is just my two cents and I'm not a financial advisor blah blah.",jmorlin,1,/r/investing/comments/mwr2lz/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gvlhfn8/,0.05,0.859,0.091,0.9707
