2,SO," Maybe unpopular opinion. 

Netflix never got to me, I don't know why, or maybe I do.

But there is just SO much content and they pump out new content at such a high rate that it just gets confusing and tiring to find something of quality to watch.

You have dinner ready, wanna watch something but spend 30min trying to find something to watch and now your dinner is cold.

And there is also a lot of ""background content"" that you just hit play on and spend maybe a minute watching it while the other 29 are spent on your phone. I know this is part of their business model, since they win YOUR time.

Like these new Adam Sandler movies, great background noise.. 

I am not surprised that they're bleeding customers.

Disney: Mandalorian, Clone wars, biggest set of IP ever

HBO: GOT, Westworld, Lovecraft country

CBS all access: StarTrek: Picard

Amazon: The expanse, The boys

Netflix: Nothing new or good

Netflix used to understand how to keep people locked into their subscription - Exceptional shows - But now they only produce crap and cut anything that goes too long. They bad black mirror, American Horror Story, The Office, Etc. All draws that get people to buy a subscription. But now they are cancelled, effectively cancelled by ""indefinite hiatus"", or in the hands of another streaming service.

4,HD," I would love to see them offer a discount if you pay for a full year. Disney and HBO Max both offer this.

I also would prefer weekly releases as opposed to releasing all episodes at once. I would think that would be good for business as well as it may help retain customers.

My ideal pricing would essentially be HBO Max pricing. Combine the standard HD plan and 4k plan into one at $14.99/month and offer a year at $149.99.

5,NFLX," I am getting extremely bullish about NFLX lately because of everyone is missing the point! People are constantly going on and on about not liking Netflix content or competition or subscriber growth, but am I the only one that is looking at the actual numbers? Has anyone looked at their financials?

Their annual and quarterly financial charts are freakin beautiful. Year on year revenue, earnings and share price growth. They are the only streaming service which is slamming out PROFITs. 2021 was an odd year but it never once (ok maybe once) went into the red from 2020  levels and we have seen 500% share price growth over the last 5 years. NFLX is the best performing TECH stock of all time by a long shot. Subscribers grew by an additional 1.5 million which beat expectations this past quarter. A person can realistically only have 1 Netflix account, so naturally growth will slow, but the only thing that truly matters is their revenue and earnings growth: both are doing just fine and are not slowing. You don't have to believe me, just take a 5 second glance at their actual numbers!

And no one is talking about them moving into video games because they are imaging something dumb or unrealistic, when in reality it will likely be a game changer. It's not going to be like a Wii Fit or a Roku or console or mobile games, if you think logically about what it could possibly look like, the only answer is interactive content like Black Mirror: Bandersnatch.

I never cared about NFLX stock because I like others don't care for the platform, literally bought my first share yesterday. It doesnt actually matter that I personally don't like the content when it's clear that enough people do because it's a solid performing stock. I am absolutely loving all of these blatantly false headlines because I am going to start loading up.

And I swear to god, if I have to read one more person talk about the FAANG acronym needing to be changed, I'm going to lose it. The accronym is not based on what stocks are hot or in favor at the moment or what stocks people like.

42,TV," Netflix is a failing business, albeit very slowly. I have been Downvoted for this in another unpopular opinion thread but it's a fact: all their competition is increasing their subscribers faster than them. Their offering is not competitive. Their search and suggestion function is garbage.

They are losing market share and are trying to solve it by cost cutting instead of innovation. 

Streaming is now such a crowded market that the margins are getting eaten. Netflix has recognised this very early and has started doing absolut dogshit own productions costing pennies in order to still make it make sense.

But this will only continue on for a couple years.

Overall, Netflix is like AOL during the dot-com bubble. Not innovative enough.


As for them trying gaming: this is exactly what I mean. This is not innovation, this is desperation. Gamers and TV watchers are two totally different target groups. One is active entertainment one is passive entertainment. 

They are doing this to tap into a new market since they themselves know they hit a ceiling, but they don't know anything about this market or have any credibility there.

*But*, when I did a trial with them, it was super nice playing a AAA game on my shitty work laptop, then, going to a friend's house and continuing the same game there while waiting for them to get ready.

Cloud gaming is a HUGE untapped market that hasn't taken off because Google and Amazon are being super greedy with their business models. GameStop with Microsoft's Azure infrastructure may be able to take charge in a few years, but it remains to be seen if Cohen and Co want to take the company in that direction.

67,MS," I havent really kept up with movies since I was a teen... I barely watch any of the popular stuff any more.

The shift to streaming games will happen. There is no stopping it any more. It works perfectly fine for anything that is not multiplayer twitch based. Single player twitch should be no problem because you can preload. Multiplayer twitch type games will require low latency internet which is actually already available in many urban areas. Outside of that, its hit or miss but that is a lot of people nonetheless which is why the big game companies havent committed. Its just a matter of time.

But the problem with most services is content. They need content to pull people and build a base. That will not come cheap. Google outright failed to make games. Thats just Google for you... Other will need to buy studios or make some crazy deals with publishers and devs. The minute you have exclusives however, its game over. The shift will begin.

The one with the best chance of accomplishing it is Microsoft. Netflix may have the infrastructure to stream now, but they have no content. Microsoft on the other has both the gaming studios and infrastructure to make it happen. But they are led by idiots who are always behind on tech. It will take a different exec to step up and make it happen or just pure luck. For example, if you make the next Elder Scrolls a MS streaming game, you instantly get a few million subs. Easily. Because its a single player game it should work for pretty much anyone with 10mb internet.

Will it suck for people who dont want streaming? I would hate it myself... but end of the day? I will buy the streaming game anyway. Because I love the series and there is no other choice. This wouldnt be the 1st time I bought into a platform I didnt want... I would never buy a console at all if not for a few exclusive games.

The only other company I see being able to really make streaming games stick is Steam (Valve). Though they dont make many games themselves, they have connections with developers already.

I hated prime cause they are interlaced with additional paid content and found no way to turn that off (I didn't try very hard).

Found their content mostly dry unless paid addtional for past the subscription (kinda defeats the purpose of the subscription)

The UI's are missing to things.

The complete list sorted..... Possibly with Genre and the ability to mark things to remove eg watched and don't watch.

Also a list of new content added.

They also tend to have a messed up favorites. like I would scroll down the list and add items to a watch queue. Can't do that either. You have to manually remove things from the watch queue after watching them and for series if you complete them. the would loop back to the start be in the queue. So you would remove them only to have to figure out manually again then the new season of something was released. Rather than just have it pop-up into the watch queue again.

Another problem I always noticed was the signal to noise ratio. They are laid out as a thumbnail grid. Typically 4 rows and 4-5 columns wide. That means you only get 20 titles max per page. Often with duplications between the rows and things you have already seen.

I can understand why some people need big thumbnail etc... But there should be options in the to display more per page. It seems to be forever scrolling to look for stuff.

I actually found it faster to use an external site. Then search directly for the item i wanted rather than use their UI. When people are doing that in a system it should be setting off alarm bells and their end of things.

Either way I have detatched from the film industry mostly these days. I havn't actually watched anything on TV or a streaming service in about a year. It wasn't like I decided one day that was going to be the case. I simple got bored and did other things.... The modern content is pathetic and boring mostly (netflix price increases didn't help their case here either). Went down the route of games for entertainment.

I doubt netflix will be able to deliver games like these in a new platform other than a reseller. But for these games even platforms like the xbox / ps5 ain't going to run a lot of the engines. They simply are not powerful enough.

Most gamers are millennial and younger, boomers and gen x and the stigmas around games they had will fade away, and gaming will be pretty common at any age.

Misconcpetions:

i) they make a loss

True, but if you back out the one-off expenses surrounding two acquisitions, Q1 2021 was profitable, even more so when you hold most of the operating expenses surrounding marketing, sales, and R&D constant.

Hint: they are investing in the business

ii) Amazon and Walmart are coming for them

Are they? Just like Amazon came for Spotify, Square, Roku, Netflix, Shopify and Etsy?

The healthcare is a very, very unique industry and I think it will be an even harder nut for them to crack than the above retail consumer facing ones.

iii) they aren't growing as fast?

Well, they increased revenue last year by 100%, on pace to increase revenue by 100% this year. Then are projected to increase revenue by up to 40% for 2022 and 2023.

$25b right now. 10 years I can easily see this as a $250b company.

I’m not saying this will happen or even that it’s likely, or that it’s without risk because it certainly has a great deal of risk, but it has potential. 

Yes, they’ve struggled in some respects, but Africa has tremendous growth potential and Jumia is only live in a few countries, and their penetration in these countries isn’t that deep. Africa will be the fastest growing (and urbanizing) region on earth in the 21st century. It’s also the youngest continent on earth, with many of the highest growth markets in the world. Many countries in Africa have strong mobile adoption, and infrastructure investments are working on building more reliable networks. There’s so much talent just waiting to be tapped into, and as it matures (which it already is In many places) there is just so much room to run. 

It may not be Jumia, but whoever figures out e-commerce in Africa (which is a very different proposition than anywhere else in the world), there is at the very least hundreds of billions of dollars on the table, and potentially trillions. 

Alibaba, JD for China, Amazon for North America and Europe, Rakuten in East Asia and penetration elsewhere, Mercado Libre in South/Central America, flipkart in India and many more. These are among the largest companies in the world, and jumia has a path to join them, but it’s minuscule now. It serves 80% of the African internet population, so there’s going to be brand loyalty because it’s built for Africans, as opposed to someone else trying to come in and learn the market. 

I’d love to hear others thoughts on this, because it feels like the risk/reward is too good to pass up (pending execution, of course)

They are tech incubator company that is working on making niche social media platforms which I see as a disrubtor to the monopoly Facebook currently has. They have a clear launching point with their first IPO mjlink that will take off( in my mind once fed legalizes marijuana) and a whole slew of others in the pipeline. 

They have a nice revenue structure once/if their IPOs take off.

220,AMZN," I am a DevOps Engineer, and I have worked a lot with Cloudflare and Fastly technologies. Therefore, I laughed a bit of the initial valuation.

I have sold half at $80, bought back at $67 and sold everything at $102.

Cloudflare is the better one between the two in my professional experience. Cloudflare is also a ""sort-of"" moat since they invested a lot in CDN infrastructure and it's extremely hard even for AMZN/MSFT/GOOGL to close in on them.

Right now they are extremely overvalued and I would wait for it to drop to at least $50-60.

240,AMZN," IMO, FSLY is a much better value right now compared to NET. They have improved A LOT in the last year (the TikTok scandal scared them a bit :) ) when it comes dependency to dependency on ""big clients"", but they are still overvalued right now IMO because they carry more risks.

They are not a moat like Cloudflare. They share almost all their availability zones with AWS and Azure, which both provide their own CDNs. They are not as diversified as Cloudflare right now, but they are improving that with their edge cloud platform, although that's heavily focused on mobile solutions, whereas Cloudflare provides the same functionality for enterprise applications. 

The really scary thing for me for both NET and FSLY is Amazon and Microsoft. NET is much better there since they have a better infrastructure and are focusing on cybersecurity and DNS too (which I don't see AMZN or MSFT diving into). FSLY is at risk there, since they share most of their infrastructure with the 2 giants. If either of them decides to invest a lot into creating a solid CDN and edge computing platform (which they both have plenty of cash on hand to invest into this endeavor), FSLY would take a huge hit. If that happens AWS and Azure could steal a lot of clients even if their service would be a bit worse, because they host most of the applications that are out there and can work on providing a very easy integration, whereas with Fastly you would need to configure it yourself which implies extra costs (paying someone who knows how to do it and time lost + maintaining the setup) which would deter most product owners.

With regards to CDN usage, in my experience, Cloudflare is much easier to use by the broader public. The Fastly documentation and support sucked last time i have used them (2 years ago). I don't mind it since that's my job, but Cloudflare offers a very easy to setup solution that requires no DevOps skills at all for basic setup.

329,CC," Lets say the stock is $10, and your average is $8. 

Then you sell a CC with a strike of $5, and immediately pocket $500 of premium. 

If the stock goes up/stays flat and your shares are called away, it's as if you sold at $10.

If the stock goes down a bit but stays above $5 and your shares are called away it's as if you sold at $10, $500 of which you received the day you sold the call, and $500 on expiry. 

If the stock drops below your strike (let's say to $4), you keep the $500 of premium and your stock, so your average is actually $3, meaning you're still up 25%. 

Selling the CC allows more potential outcomes than just selling the stock at market for $10. It's useful when you think the stock may drop (either above or below your strike) or trade sideways.

If the stock was dormant and had a sudden run-up, the IV and therefore premiums will be high, which is great for collecting large premiums and/or protecting gains. I've personally made a ton of money this year selling ITM CCs after a run-up. Worst-case I've capped my gains, best-case I'm able to time it near the top before it crashes back down below my strike. If it dips below the strike you can either hope it stays there and expires worthless, or just buy it back for significantly less than you were paid for it before it runs back up.",IllBiteYourLegsOff,2,/r/stocks/comments/opafgd/rstocks_daily_discussion_options_trading_thursday/h65y9cb/,0.048,0.855,0.097,0.9446

Nvidea has a 500 billion dollar market cap because of their good pipeline of current products, as well as potential for the future.

Also, take a look at Nvidia's current financial strength, valuation ratios, and margins like sales, profit margins, EBITDA margins, etc.

Right now, at this stage, when taken as a whole, Nvidia's fundamentals are better when compared to AMD's. That's why they are a 500 billion dollar market cap company right now.

Is it possible that AMD shares appreciate to 500/share? Yes. But with the cutthroat competition right now in the CPU, GPU and chipsets space, doing that in only ""a few years"" would be insanely hard.

397,AMZN," I would say AMZN has and it isn't in a dip, but you need to widen the timeframe to 2-3 years.

AMZN was perfectly positioned to do extremely well in the initial stages of the Covid Pandemic and it continued to do so throughout. Other companies weren't, took a dip in March 2020 and remained dipped for several months and slowly grew back before surging later in 2020.

So while other companies took a hit around March of 2020 and then had to rebound and grow later, AMZN grew really strongly those first few months and never took a hit. From March 2020 to August 2020, it surged.

So I would say it did rally, it just rallied before most other companies. It was priced so well when other companies rallied later in the pandemic, it didn't have as much room to grow.

&#x200B;

My two cents to the OP. I own some shares. I see no reason not to buy AMZN, but I would keep your portfolio well diversified. Do not forget whenever you buy an S&P 500 index fund that it is weighted to 3.9% AMZN. If you own the NASDAQ-100, QQQ, AMZN is weighted to 8.5% of that index fund, so you already have a strong exposure to it through most many indexes.

I would factor that into any decision you make and I would personally lean towards keeping my money diversified in indexes.",cwdawg15,10,/r/stocks/comments/op4kxw/is_now_an_ok_time_to_buy_an_amazon_share/h638ihu/,0.011,0.877,0.111,0.9767

407,AMZN," Yeah. If Naples was suggesting long-expiration (which I would assume since he says ""not sure how far out you can buy them""), one call option on AMZN in with an expiration in January 2023 at a strike of $3,750 would cost you $44,690 to purchase.

A ""true LEAP"" that is deep in the money expiring in Jan 2023 with a strike of $3,000 would run about $84,657 *per contract*.

Yes, one contract represents 100 shares, so is much less than buying 100 shares of AMZN outright, but certainly a bit much if you're just looking at dropping the funds needed to purchase 1 share.",NativeTxn7,2,/r/stocks/comments/op4kxw/is_now_an_ok_time_to_buy_an_amazon_share/h6334at/,0.037,0.827,0.136,0.858

USA has been pushing for EV's and Biden's team has been actively trying to get more infrastucture/tax credits for EV.

China offers crazy tax incentives for EV's and their infrastructure for EV's is insane.

In many parts of Europe, driving an EV is cheaper than driving an ICE and with the amount of new regulations, driving an EV is almost a no-brainer considering some countries are even giving special access to EV drivers such as EV only parking spots.

Next, people want to invest in the new Tesla. It doesn't take a genius to see that Tesla has proven that EV is sustainable and a very lucrative investment. Other EV's are trying to join in on that craze which is why so many EV alternatives have been popping up. GM is putting nearly $40 billion into EV innovation and plans to fully be EV only by 2035. Volkswagen has made similar pledges. Eventually, ICE vehicles will be largely obsolete in terms of new vehicle manufacturing.

Auto sales every year is around 50-70 million units. It's one of the largest industries in the world. Most people not being able to afford EV's depends on the type of EV but the costs are reducing and will eventually be comparable or lower than ICE vehicles.

Now, I know there's a swath of difference between a horse-drawn carriage and the combustion engine, but I still think it's a valid comparison.

Beyond designing a vehicle(s) you have to master the manufacturing process, connect an intensely complex supply chain, market appropriately, and be able to deliver inventory efficiently and at a good price. Ford et al. have a century of experience doing this. I think what TSLA has managed is monumental, but I think the EV space will suffer the same fate as the early car market did; there'll be a handful of winners, and many well-intentioned failures.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not an EV bear. I think they are indeed the future of transportation. It's just that new technologies meant for mass adoption always seem to go through a ""troubleshooting"" period of serious risk.
