33,DD," It‚Äôs simple I‚Äôll start with calls (only doing covered calls and cash covered puts)

You own 100 shares of X company at $50. You want to keep holding this company long term but you don‚Äôt expect much movement to happen soon, however you don‚Äôt want your money just sitting there not making you MORE money while you wait for the price to go up. So you sell a covered call. You pick a strike price that you are comfortable selling your shares at i.e. if you bought your shares at $50 each and you want to make 50% on your investment on the stock you sell covered calls at the $75 strike price. The cost of the call is called the premium; how much a call costs/how much you can sell it for. You times the premium by 100 because each contract is for 100 shares. When you sell a covered call you give up 100shares x however many calls you sell as collateral that is why it‚Äôs called a ‚Äúcovered‚Äù call because if it exercises you have the shares to cover your position instead of having to deposit funds or buy 100 shares to be able to fulfill the call you sold. You MUST do this because the person who buys your covered call has the right to do something called ‚Äúexercising‚Äù the call. When someone exercises a call they have bought then they are buying 100 shares, at the strike price, from whoever they bought that call from.  

So you sell a covered call at a $75 strike price with a $5 premium that expires one month from today.  You instantly get $500 from selling that call that you can do whatever you want with it‚Äôs your money now. 

Here comes the risk section. While your call is in effect you have given up 100 shares per call as collateral so you can‚Äôt do anything with them until the call you sold expires, you buy the call back from whoever bought it, or the buyer of your call exercises the option (which means they buy 100 shares from you at the $75 strike price). The risk part happens when the stock price goes down, because you have your shares given up as collateral you are unable to put any stop losses in effect to limit loss in case the price tanks. A way around this is to monitor the price of your call, if the price of the stock tanks then likely your calls value will drop with it meaning that you can buy back the call if you want to free your 100 shares from being held as collateral. Generally though you sell covered calls if you are long the stock so hopefully your DD gives you strength to not panic during dips. 

The other part of the ‚Äúrisk‚Äù with selling covered calls is that it limits your potential gains before the call is expired. If you have the shares at $50 and sell calls at a $75 strike price and the price of the stock goes to $100 from an unexpected catalyst or whatever then your calls will be exercised and you will be selling your shares in collateral for $75 instead of $100. In this case you made $500 from the premium and you got a 50% return on your investment, still good but you could have had a 100% return. 

You buy calls when you expect the price of a stock to go up a bunch but you don‚Äôt have the funds to buy a lot of shares. When you buy a call your risk is limited to strictly how much you paid for the call. If the call had a $2 premium then you pay $200 for the call and if it expires OTM then you just lost $200 and that‚Äôs it.  
OTM means out of the money. When a call is out of the money it means that the price of the stock is LESS THAN the strike price. The stock at $50 is OTM on a $75 strike price call. It is ITM (in the money) when it is above the strike price. The upside is that when the price of a stock goes above the strike price of the call you have bought you can sell that call you bought to someone else for MORE than you paid for it, collect your free money and go to sleep happy. You can also exercise your call that you bought meaning that you are going to buy shares at the strike price from whoever sold that call to you. So X company is at $50 you buy a $60 strike price call and then the price of the stock goes to $100. You can either sell your call to someone else get some money and be done with it or you can exercise the call and buy 100 shares at your strike price of $60 and then you are the proud owner of 100 shares of X company at $60 while the market price is $100. You can then immediately sell your 100 shares at market price of $100 or hodl them if you think it‚Äôll keep going up






So short version calls limit your gains when you sell them but when times right can make you money while your stock is trading sideways or slightly up. However you are unable to do anything with your shares before your call has expired making the risk during a crash or correction significantly higher. 

Buying calls is a way to make money off of a stock moving upwards without having to expose yourself to the risk of actually owning shares. 

Puts are pretty much the same, just opposite xD
Let‚Äôs say you own 100 shares of X company at $50 but you want to limit your risk to a 10% loss of $45 a share. So you buy a put with a $45 dollar strike price. (For puts OTM and ITM are different from calls. A puts ITM is anything LOWER than the strike price and OTM is HIGHER than the strike price.) When you buy that put for $45 you are buying the right to sell 100 of your shares to whoever sold the put that you bought. You do this if the stock is volatile because you don‚Äôt want random down turns to trigger a stop loss making you sell when the price recovers fast. Since you have that put at $45 of the stock crashes for real from $50 to $10 or whatever, not just daily volatility, then you have protected yourself by having the right to sell your shares at $45 instead of the market price of $10.  The cost of puts is the premium and you also times that by 100 because each contract is for 100 shares. So you take that into consideration as well. Buying a $2 put at $45 strike price costs you $200 so it‚Äôs up to if you feel the price of the put is worth the safety net during an unexpected crash.   

Selling a cash covered out means that you expect the price to go down and you want to buy up some shares during that dip, however you also want to make money while you wait for your entry price on the stock. 

You expect X company‚Äôs share price to fall from $50 to $25. You you sell a cash covered put at the $25 strike price for $2.50 premium. You instantly get $250 to do whatever you want with but you have to throw down $25x100 so $2500 as collateral. You do this because the person who bought your put has the right to exercise their put and sell you 100 of their shares at $25 costing you $2500. This is perfect because you originally wanted in at $25 and you made $250 waiting for the price to get down that low. The downside is that your cash is held as collateral until the put expires, is exercised, or you buy back the put you sold from whoever you sold it to. There isn‚Äôt too much risk here because if the price goes up then your put is OTM and if it expires OTM you get your money back from collateral and you keep the $250 you made selling the put, you were just unable to make other potentially profitable trades with the money that was held in collateral. So it‚Äôs basically making money while you wait for the price of a stock to drop to what you want to enter at.

Tax the rich and they take their business to a different country. There goes your job.

Tax the rich they sale their stocks. Market tanks. There goes your investments.

Tax the rich they raise prices on their products to compensate for the high tax prices. You think IPhones are over priced now?
