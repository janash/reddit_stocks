Psychedelics Wellness Company Delic: Proven Management Team with a Star-Studded Board
Whitefish, Montana--(Newsfile Corp. - April 6, 2021) -  CFN Enterprises Inc. (OTCQB: CNFN), owner and operator of CFN Media, the leading media network dedicated to the global legal cannabis, CBD and psychedelics industries, today announced an article covering The Delic Holdings Inc. (CSE: DELC) (OTCQX: DELCF).

The psychedelics sector is quickly evolving into a multi-billion-dollar industry with a growing number of publicly traded companies. As with any new industry, there are many companies backed by little more than financiers looking to make a quick dollar before moving on to the next opportunity, which makes it important for investors to know who's at the helm.
Let's take a look at what sets Delic Holdings Inc.'s (CSE: DELC) (OTCQB: DELCF) management team apart and why its board members represent a strong vote of confidence in the team and business over the long-term.
Experienced Management
Delic was founded by veterans from the cannabis industry-another highly-regulated industry that went from zero to billions of dollars in just a handful of years.
Co-Founders Matt and Jackee Stang were executives at High Times, a leading counterculture publication that became the voice for the cannabis industry. In fact, the monthly magazine had a circulation of over 500,000 copies an issue, rivaling Rolling Stone, and its website attracted 500,000 to five million users each month by 2014 as cannabis took off.
Matt Stang was a previous owner and operator of High Times, was instrumental in legalizing cannabis in multiple states and launched the Cannabis Cup in America. After interacting with all corners of the cannabis community for two decades, he helped found Delic two years ago as one of the first psychedelic corporations. His expertise in marketing, branding, business development and product viability will prove invaluable as he shapes the company's vision and path.
Most recently, John Coleman, Ph.D., former President of Anandia Labs, a cannabis biotech company focused on genetics and analytics, was hired as VP of Business Development. With a foot in both corporate and scientific worlds, Dr. Coleman is well-equipped to head up the company's business development efforts as it looks to enter new vertical markets.
The company also recently hired Zak Garcia, former CMO of Bulletproof Inc., maker of the well-known Bulletproof® Coffee brand, as its Chief Marketing Officer. Mr. Garcia is a highly sought-after marketing and leadership strategist that helped grow Bulletproof® Coffee to over $250 million in revenue-experience that will help bring Delic to the next level of growth.

Renowned Billion-Dollar Backers
Delic's management team is supported by an impressive Board of Directors that reads like a who's who of success stories in cannabis and other industries.
Paul Rosen founded the $4 billion Cronos Group and orchestrated the famous $1.8 billion Altria stake that kicked off the industry's meteoric growth. 
Kraig Fox was a Senior Managing Director at Guggenheim Partners and later served as President and CEO of High Times. The involvement of these industry icons alone represents a big vote of confidence in the management team.
Mr. Rosen and Mr. Fox are joined by entrepreneur and venture capitalist Martin Tobias, finance veteran Sashko Despotovski and Dr. Markus Roggen, Founder and CEO of Complex Biotech Discovery Ventures. On the board of advisors, investors will find best-selling author Shep Gordon, Apollo Neuroscience Founder Dave Rabin and other leading voices.
The company's well-known and respected board members provide a vote of confidence in the management team, valuable connections to grow its businesses and expertise that can be called upon to help make strategic decisions. With a wide range of expertise and disciplines, these team members could be invaluable in building long-term shareholder value.

Looking Ahead
Delic Holdings Inc. (CSE: DELC) (OTCQB: DELCF) is well-equipped to grow with its veteran executive team and its star-studded board of directors and advisors. With the right team in place, the company has been actively making acquisitions to become a strategic and diversified player in the nascent psychedelics industry today and well into the future.

“The North American helium market has been upended in recent years after a 2013 law required the U.S. government to sell off its strategic helium reserve, which it has been maintaining in Amarillo, Tx. since the 1920s. The U.S. government is set to sell its last remaining helium stores by Sept. 2021 and the drain on that supply has turned the country into a net importer of the inert gas, which doesn’t combust and is used in MRI machines, to cool super conductors and as a purge gas for rocket ships.”",BandicootBeginning85,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/mym353/anyone_look_at_investing_in_the_helium_market_a/gvxeswf/,0.0,0.928,0.072,0.8271

73,DD," Initial testing confirmed Royal Helium to have Economic Helium Concentrations ranging for .34% to .94% in their first 3 wells. The June results will be the completed testing. It is a 3rd party doing the testing. Sproule I believe the name is.

Royal helium pay zones are large. 45-90ft and layered depending on the well.

DME is the opposite, 7% concentration with a pay zone which is much smaller(15 feet I think)

That’s why Royal Helium, in my opinion, is such a great play today. The helium is there, they just don’t know how much!!! There is much less risk involved now that the initial results have been released.

Do your DD but it’s worth looking deeper into and adding to your watch list.

76,DD," Most of the time a 5 minute search prior to purchasing the stock can prevent this. Always, and I mean always, scan the last year worth of news provided by the company. You can do this on the company website but I recommend Sedar or Edgar. What you will be looking for is anything that is related to financing or private placements. Every placement comes with shares and warrants that are locked up for a period of time (Usually 4 months) and always causes a company's share price to dip for a short period of time. As a rule, the financing is below market so you will find most of the tradable shares being dumped for fast gains after the lock up. It is like clockwork so add this to your DD so you don't get surprised. A lot of people with cheap shares will short sell a few days before the lock up ends and cover when they can access their shares. This is why prices dip a week before and stay down for a while after.

Now is he connected?  Well he was associated with ABML in recent past and is likely the reason they got a grant from the U.S. government.
