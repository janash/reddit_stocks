2,GME," 8 years old is way too young to understand all the inner workings of the market. 

Although I bought my niece (7 years old) 8 shares of GME @40 and she does understand the price going up and down and she has learned how to calculate how much money she has made/lost. She is excellent at math and thinks it‚Äôs a wonderful game. 

She had gotten very good at her multiplication tables and decimals with this practice. Simplify it my dude. And because it‚Äôs HER money she is always very interested to know where she stands.

Edit- it‚Äôs also cool because I take her to the actual GameStop brick and mortar and she knows that she is an investor (owns a tiny slice of the company). She walks through that place like a Queen.

3,RBLX," > I told him I was going to spend his savings on buying RBLX.

So you sent him the message that if he works hard on saving money, you'll take it and do whatever you want with it. And if that investment fails, there's a really good chance he's just going to internalize that you're a dickhead that took his money.

Kids don't learn lessons like adults do. Be careful.

17,PW," I called Apple once to say that my son had spent $200 on smurfberries during a 15 minutes period of time when once logged out, the spending ability still was in tact - a glitch they probably have fixed.  This was within days of receiveing an ipod touch for Christmas back when he was about 11 or 12.  He even came up to me and said, ""Hey Mom, look I can buy $5 in Smurberries"", as he touched the button and it confirmed the sale.  I had no idea what I was looking at.  A few days later, my husband asked, ""Why do I have a $200 charge on iTunes?""  I said I don't know let me call apple.  The applecare rep said it happens all the time when kids get these devices and that they allow a one time reimbursement and walked me through the settings of how to PW protect the device.  While on the call, I also explained while laughing so hard I could hardly believe my own words that the craziest part is that my son reset the game so not only do we have a $200 charge but he no longer has the of smurberries.  The rep confirmed that when you reset the game all the smurfberries go away.  A few years later, we began having charges again.  Turns out that they get older and learn that while we are sleeping that they can enter our credit card and download music, $60 at a time.  So you have this stuff to look forward to!  In that case, we made him pay us back nickel by nickel, dollar by dollar.

If you look into the history of Amazon, their philosophy is to disrupt. But everything ultimately leads back to the technology side of things.

Is it possible they want to kill grocers, yes. But if you look at what this store has that traditional grocers don‚Äôt, it‚Äôs the technology and intellectual property.

Aren't we all?

We know the world is going to need EVs soon yet all of the stocks went down since January. Sure it'll only go up from here but we don't know when because the rich is still stuck on oil.

Vaccines are needed in the world but their stocks didn't really spike up as much as TSLA or AMAZON did during the pandemic.

I saw EA went down 2010 to $14, heard they were buying stocks to stay alive - they are now $100+ and they're still a shit company.

it's all speculation and popularity and I've watched these things happened behind the scene for too long.

Mac revenue increased $2billion in Q42020 compared to 2019 as well, and the new apple silicon mac lineup is still yet to fully release (with some exciting stuff like M1 iMac and M2 (or M1X) chips this year).

iPad and accessories are anchors in their respective classes and aren't going anywhere, and services only get better the more they add to appleTV+ (and because people paying for apple one like me are probably in way too deep and not going to switch). Not to mention that they have more in cash reserves (~200B) than the market cap of entire companies like Netflix, Coca Cola, Disney, or Toyota.

Nothing IMO on the horizon poses any major threat to any one of the product categories in its entire lineup. Their weakest product is probably the homepod, but even then they make more in profit per unit than all the others and dominate the +$200 category.

191,DCF," No problem if you have any questions feel free to ask me. I found an article here (Link at the end). Its basically like this: you estimate a growth factor for your free Cashflow but you Need to ask yourself about the cost to generate this cashflow. In DCF the answer is that you use cost of equity and cost of liabilities. 

[Equity ratio * cost of equity] + [liability ratio * cost of liab] * (1-tax rate) = WACC

Now you have to go one step deeper to generate the cost of equity and liab. One would use CAPM Model. 

Generating cost of equity and liab isnt easy i suggest reading some articles about CAPM and beta factor.

201,DD," Honestly, good that your order didn't fill as it means the price level shot above what you were willing to invest. FOMO is your worst enemy in the stock market. IPOs (new stock issues) are ususally oversigned multiple times, and a public listing like RBLX did is usually too hot to enter immediately. Read up on Demand vs Offering to get why it might be a bad idea to FOMO into an IPO immediately.

I usually watch them from the sidelines. If it heats up too quickly people FOMOing in usually pay way too much of an upside to the fair valuation and it will calm down significantly after the initial Bull Run. You don't lose anything but then again you don't win anything.

You'Re looking for a long-term investment, contrary to the ""GME Rocket to the Moon"" meme ideal of making 1000s % in gain. Don't believe for a minute this is the ""normal"" on the stock market. It's the absolutely abnormal side of the market that more resembles the famed ""Sir, this is a Casino"" meme more than ""investing"".

Also, as I've seen this comment here, don't let random reddit people tell you ""to get a new job""... not only is that downright rude, I'd take a high bet someone being that rude is stuck in a shit job themselves and trying to kick at what they perceive a downward direction. Just my 2 cents.

Hence, here are my tips - based on my experience. 

The best strategy getting into investing - neverminding the time of order placement or execution - is to set a few rules:

1. Find a stock you'd like to buy / stay invested in
2. Read up, do your own DD to find the fair price you'd be willing to pay for one unit of stock at the current fundamental levels available. Ie. you see a stock, say ""Oh wow! Company X sounds like a rock solid, long-term growth investment. They have a great product or service and will likely double their value in two to five years time. I like that company X so much, I want to buy some shares. Seeing the current price trajectory I'm willing to invest 22.80 into it per stock as a fair buy at this point in time.""
3. Set limit order to buy X units at 22.80 open for trading (some brokers let you set orders to stay active several months, depends on what you use)
4. Set order and forget. Your price might not ""hit"" immediately. But market conditions rapidly change. It might hit a day or days later. Just make sure you don't let it ride for too long without checking price levels or it might get away from you. Sometimes you'd need to upgrade the order in case the price has a hike upwards to get some shares.
5. If your order it gets executed, great, you're now the proud owner of X Stock for Y Company and intend to stay in it for the long haul to see it grow (hopefully)
6. Based on your risk profile you either set an immediate stop loss (ie. if Stock loses X amount of value, execute an automatic sell on your behalf to limit ""losses"")
   1. OR: if you don't care about ""virtual losses"" on the books, just let it ride.
   2. Adversely, set a ""take win"" order if you'd like, ie when Stock gains Z amount of value, execute an automatic sell-off of all or at least a part of your shares to the market (some do this to ""take the entry fee back"". Something that's very individual to your investor profile and your philosophy.

IPOs (new stock issues) are ususally oversigned multiple times, and a public listing like RBLX did is usually too hot to enter immediately. Read up on Demand vs Offering to get why it might be a bad idea to FOMO into an IPO immediately.

I usually watch them from the sidelines. If it heats up too quickly people FOMOing in usually pay way too much of an upside to the fair valuation and it will calm down significantly after the initial Bull Run. You don't lose anything but then again you don't win anything.

You'Re looking for a long-term investment, contrary to the ""GME Rocket to the Moon"" meme ideal of making 1000s % in gain. Don't believe for a minute this is the ""normal"" on the stock market. It's the absolutely abnormal side of the market that more resembles the famed ""Sir, this is a Casino"" meme more than ""investing"".

Also, as I've seen this comment here, don't let random reddit people tell you ""to get a new job""... not only is that downright rude, I'd take a high bet someone being that rude is stuck in a shit job themselves and trying to kick at what they perceive a downward direction. Just my 2 cents.

Hence, here are my tips - based on my experience. 

The best strategy getting into investing - neverminding the time of order placement or execution - is to set a few rules:

1. Find a stock you'd like to buy / stay invested in
2. Read up, do your own DD to find the fair price you'd be willing to pay for one unit of stock at the current fundamental levels available. Ie. you see a stock, say ""Oh wow! Company X sounds like a rock solid, long-term growth investment. They have a great product or service and will likely double their value in two to five years time. I like that company X so much, I want to buy some shares. Seeing the current price trajectory I'm willing to invest 22.80 into it per stock as a fair buy at this point in time.""
3. Set limit order to buy X units at 22.80 open for trading (some brokers let you set orders to stay active several months, depends on what you use)
4. Set order and forget. Your price might not ""hit"" immediately. But market conditions rapidly change. It might hit a day or days later. Just make sure you don't let it ride for too long without checking price levels or it might get away from you. Sometimes you'd need to upgrade the order in case the price has a hike upwards to get some shares.
5. If your order it gets executed, great, you're now the proud owner of X Stock for Y Company and intend to stay in it for the long haul to see it grow (hopefully)
6. Based on your risk profile you either set an immediate stop loss (ie. if Stock loses X amount of value, execute an automatic sell on your behalf to limit ""losses"")
   1. OR: if you don't care about ""virtual losses"" on the books, just let it ride.
   2. Adversely, set a ""take win"" order if you'd like, ie when Stock gains Z amount of value, execute an automatic sell-off of all or at least a part of your shares to the market (some do this to ""take the entry fee back"". Something that's very individual to your investor profile and your philosophy.

203,RBLX," You could just play around some more with different order types. Lots of people set their limit orders too low yesterday even though they were awake and watching. And RBLX isn‚Äôt even moving that much, so it should be no problem to set a slightly higher limit order and score some shares today. 

But the real question is, how much are you willing to pay? I feel like if they had started this thing at $30 it would have shot up to $100 as everyone scrambled to get in. But it‚Äôs just sticking around $72, so you aren‚Äôt actually missing out on any action right now, unless you had planned on buying a massive amount of shares and selling right away for a $5-9 profit per share.

215,TSLA," I understand everything is ""high."" But it's precisely that reasoning that leads to these decisions that you lament. I wanted to buy TSLA in April. I bought other stocks for ""serious investing,"" and I was very much influenced by others' narratives in regard to growth stocks. My value stocks all underperformed dramatically in comparison to TSLA. (And, yes, I understand 2020 was a great year for growth, but many years were great for high P/E future-oriented companies such as Amazon in the past.)

Most people are enamored by Warren Buffet, but it is not the only investment strategy in the world. I learnt that I prefer Peter Lynch's or Bezos's philosophy of investing (""if you have a 10% chance at 100x returns, you should always take it. You're still going to fail 9/10 times, but the rewards are well worth it."") Now I just buy what I believe has a big growth potential in future whenever I can (and especially during a correction).  


Edit to add: Lynch knew that his strategy will make him lose on some stocks (for example, he bought all search engines because he did not know which one will win), but that the winner will make up for it (google did). I've learnt that I prefer stocks that can surprise me more than I do steady value stocks (I have both in my portfolio). But not everyone is the same.

The Fed has to consider such information given the role which the sovereign debt and credit of the USG (as well as the USD) play in global financial architecture.

228,BP," I think that it's a matter of the price you pay for long term growth. New technologies tend to get overhyped at the beginning because people underestimate how much time it will take to bring them to fruition (see the Gartner hype cycle). So you risk buying in at a high price during this hype period, which reduces your return long term. Even if your general thesis is correct and you manage to pick one of the winners.

On the other hand oil companies were undervalued last autumn precisely because many people underestimated how long our economy will still need oil until we can transition to green energy. In that sense they were a good opportunity in terms of price, even though in the long run they'll have to change their business model and become environmentally accountable if they want to survive (something that companies such as BP and RDS are beginning to understand pretty well, since they are getting serious about gradually becoming green energy companies).",Ahrideva,3,/r/stocks/comments/m2ve17/market_correction_and_yield_narrative_looks_to_be/gqm0eg3/,0.051,0.804,0.145,0.9444

No no no.

The 2239 loss is the loss for owning an equity worth zero that you paid 2350 for, taking into account the 111 you made on premium.

255,TSLA," I 'may' be completely wrong on what I'm about to say, but I think a lot of people will purchase a long call (like months out) as a hedge against a put sell. And in some cases, people will do spreads simply hoping the price stays between them, and if it gets exercised, I believe the call option is the other leg they can use to offset that cost (in case they are lacking the pure capital to purchase 100 shares of the put option).  My understanding of the potential loophole that has screwed over some people is when the put option ""expires worthless"" (i.e; Friday, 4pm) but after hours trading sends it ITM, and the buyer chooses to exercise it.  In one case with TSLA a few months back this happened, and some guy who expected a $500 loss (premium) max...never had the other leg executed (cause it all happened after hours on a Friday) and his account essentially needed the capital for 100 shares of TSLA and it was like $25,000 or something.",majorchamp,1,/r/stocks/comments/m2s5f9/selling_put_option_want_to_make_sure_i_understand/gqlswnl/,0.073,0.859,0.069,-0.1893

428,CX," Sorry for a quick comment without reading your DD, but want to share my experience with them. When I tried selling my 2013 Volvo C30, a fairly unique car, shift didn't do a good job. At first they gave me a valuation of $12.1k which would expire in a few days... At this point I wasn't really serious so I just sat on it for another month. Then I tried the same one-two  months later and then Shift said now your car price is $10.6k! I was like what!!! (this price was closer to what a dealer would have paid, maybe +/-500 range)

So I was curious what Carvana would quote for my car. Within minutes of being on their website, they quoted me $14.1k.... And yes, that's what I went with and throughout the process I kept feeling like at some point there will be a catch somewhere and they will reduce to about $11k. But no, no catch just a superior customer experience at Carvana. 

Now of course this is anecdotal and probably means Shift is more profit minded (better for investor) but CX like this stays with someone for a long time.

432,DD," I was going to pop a comment here about Carlotz (LOTZ) too.  I think they're a WAY more fair company to compare Shift to vs Carvana.  **I have no positions in any of these companies** but Vroom and Shift are publicly-traded babies compared to Carmax and Carvana, for example, both of which have so much more name recognition than Shift and Carlotz.

The DD provided above seems solid so this comment is not *for* or *against* but if I were considering an investment here I'd be thinking about two primary factors:

1. Name recognition, or lack thereof, in an increasingly competitive space
2. How they compare to like-sized and established peers",MadeToOrderName,2,/r/stocks/comments/m2rh7l/shift_sft_dd_a_rapidly_growing_competitor_to/gqm2f57/,0.041,0.907,0.052,0.0507

522,GME," It's alright, I think the main lesson from this whole event is that the stock market is cool and many people have found a new interest in it, but it's very clear that most of us were (and still are) very suceptable to crowd behaviour

So long as you're using the experiences to learn new things without risking more than you can afford to lose, it's all good. Besides, even if you know a lot about the markets, cogs are whirring behind the scenes that seem to mean what actually happens with GME is detatched from reasonable or informed predictions anyway so I wouldn't beat yourself up about it

528,TDOC," TDOCs business model is undeniably the future. The demand in healthcare is constantly increasing as our population keeps growing and people reach a higher age, while there is a shortage of doctors. Therefore, a platform that helps connect supply and demand is necessary to somehow meet the need.

In addition to a great market perspective, telehealth offers so many other benefits. TDOC seems to be the market leader and their technological advances compared to their competitors make it look like a big enough moat to me. 

Cathie Wood and many other large investors also believe strongly in the company.

529,TDOC," My wife is a telehealth nurse practitioner. I've had my eye on TDOC over the last 2 years, long before I knew ARK had a position. The Livongo merger really pushed me into buying. What I believe is a synergistic move is considered to be overpaying by wallstreet. As we all know they only care about next quarter. As it stands we're back to March/April 2020 valuation. 

I'm up to 6% of my portfolio now into TDOC. If it's keeps dropping I'm going to sell off other positions and scoop up the fire sale even if it's a higher % of my portfolio than I'd want long term.

As with a lot of tech we were already headed into telemedicine (convenience, low cost) before Covid. The only thing Covid did was expedite adoption as many were pushed into telehealth visits that they probably wouldn't have done otherwise.

530,AI," I have TDOC at $212, and I'm holding and plan to add as if it continues to go down. Currently TDOC has dropped below its 200MA. It could keep falling to its next support level which is around 170 from back in November. Which gives it a potential 100% upside to its ATH in February.

The most recent price panic is due to the earnings call being less than stellar. Their membership growth was projected to slow down. But their revenue projections and earnings projections are very bullish.

https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/03/10/3-top-stocks-to-buy-during-this-market-crash

For me, if you haven't bought in yet I would watch the price action as you can probably get it at a steal around $175. But, with current market forces its all kind of a guessing game. Maybe sell a cash secured PUT to hedge against an upside movement and buy shares if it moves against you?

Be aware, TDOC is a total see-saw. I've been in it since August and it bounced around with 20% swings regularly. It can be infuriating as it struggles to break through many times before.

Either way, I think its a good stock to own, its in ARKK so Cathie believes in it, and there's good partnerships and evidence to indicate that TDOC is the future of medicine. Current medical practices cannot scale without adopting telehealth and AI based solutions. TDOC is offering to do both, which I think will give them a strong footing for the next 5 years.

543,AMD," There are a couple of ways to do this:

1) Look at the current P/S and P/E ratios and compare to the company's historical range. In the case of NVDA, the stock had never traded at a PE higher than 60.  It recently reached over 80 and has since come down a bit, but it is still quite a bit higher than its historical range.

2) Look at the market cap and the market cap relative to revenue.  NVDA's market cap is $320B on annual revenue of $16.7B.  That gives you a market cap/revenue of 19.2.  As a comparison, AMD has a market cap of $97.7B on annual revenue of $9.8B for a market cap/revenue of \~10.  So AMD looks like the better value.

3) Look at forward revenue and earnings projections to get a sense of growth prospects.  Ideally you want a company that is relatively undervalued but has strong growth projections.  NVDA is projecting 33% earnings growth for this year and 11% for the following year.  AMD is projecting 52% and 28% respectively.

545,AMZN," I use a very simple idea for investing--will the company earn in profits equivalent to its current market value by the 10th year?

The reason that I'm using the above question is because I am comparing the returns of a stock against the profit earned in real-estate. I presume the profit in real-estate is about 10% a year--so, it'll take about 10 years to earn back the cost of investment in real-estate.

Let's take AMZN. Its current p/e ratio is 74.07. So, earnings/price = 1/(74.07). And, if we agree that it can reasonably grow 36.03% (in revenue or profits) per year, then over 10 years, it would grow by a factor of (1.3603)\^10 =  21.694366891. So, in 10 years, it would earn 1/(74.07)\*(1.3603)\^10 =  0.29289006198 or roughly 29% of its current market cap (per year)--whereas real-estate would roughly only give a flat 10% year over year.

Once it‚Äôs federally legal and if done right, there will be tons of tax incentives to grow, much like farmers get paid and are heavily subsidized and basically anything you buy can be a write off if you‚Äôre in agriculture (not joking, between my family owning a rice farm and working at HD/lows for a while farmers have tax free everything basically). I know a few who already went legit up in OK and got a few acres to grow medically. They are making about 3x what they were when they were dealers/ suppliers and have no stress about raids or cops.

561,TLRY," There‚Äôs way more to be made in weed than in avocados. There‚Äôs also going to be a point in time where weed is legal in the states which would cause Mexican cartels to refocus and lose a large driving part of their profits. Mexico just having legal weed in general will surround the US with legal weed and it will be pouring across the boarder. 

Additionally the legal weed sector could be worth close to $1 trillion in the coming decade, compare that to the cartels that bring in an estimated combined $9-23 billion. That much money is sure to attract private businesses, businesses with a bit more defense than avocado farms. Not saying that will solve anything but TLRY bringing in private security for their farms or labs would definitely cause some to think twice.  They could also just straight up buy out individual cartels and make them be their security arm in the region.  Collectively there‚Äôs wayyy more money in the legal sector, either they turn legit like the bootleggers that made moonshine and transformed into major distributors today or they get strong armed out in a violent exchange between the government and private companies (who can buy off officials easier than cartels can and spend more).",TheFondestComb,1,/r/stocks/comments/m2fkjq/what_stocks_might_profit_from_mexicos/gqjg6lh/,0.031,0.797,0.172,0.974

585,IRR," Generally, the 30-year CAGR (or even the 25-year CAGR) of the S&P tends to be what gets quoted by finance experts as the benchmark.  That figure is 10.67%.

Also, I'm not sure what term he uses but ""annual average return"" is confusing because the quoted metric, Compounded Annual Growth Rate, is not the same thing as Internal Rate of Return, which is a metric you use to measure the straightforward return on a single investment:   (Proceeds - Cost Basis)/Cost Basis.

CAGR is calculated differently.  It's this:

((Ending Balance / Beginning Balance)^(1/n)) -1

where n is the number of years.

Taken together, the IRR and CAGR tell you the efficiency of your individual investment decisions and the resulting overall annualized growth of the portfolio.  e.g. you might make many small, inefficient trades resulting in small, incremental returns, but then end up with a sizable amount of growth.  Knowing both helps you assess where you need to tune your investment strategy to optimize returns and reduce risk exposure.",th3cr1t1c,1,/r/stocks/comments/m2dlbq/12_annual_average_returns_sp500_dave_ramsey/gqint1t/,0.036,0.838,0.126,0.9525

I used to own EA with a $150 - $170 price target. Good company as well and I think continued success with Apex Legends + Battlefield 6 being a hit will lead the stock higher within this year.

In the mid-1990s the FCC was running trials of prototype HDTV tech to choose the system they would impressed as the HD standard. There were a dozen or so competitors. I put enough into one of them to be a 0.1% owner of the company, on the premise that they had the best candidate system. A couple of months later the FCC announced that none of the companies had presented a complete solution, and they were reorganizing the competitors into two groups that would integrate their components together to complete the evaluation. Having to share the win with 5 competitors significantly diluted the benefit that the one company would be able to derive. The stock tanked.

632,MSFT," I like AT&T but it‚Äôs riskier than most dividend stocks and for certain riskier than MSFT. They have a shitton of debt. Definitely be aware of that before buying.

641,IMO," Never understood people who worry about whether a growth stock is overvalued. Of course growth stocks are overvalued. If they were fairly valued, why would anyone ever own any other kind of stock? 

The primary worry should be whether or not the company can continue executing it's business strategy and continue growing. Roku is in an excellent position to do so, with several catalysts for growth mentioned by OP. Roku continues to be heavily dedicated to growing platform revenues. 

Revenues are projected to be about $8b in 2025. IMO projections are underestimated because too much of it's hardware revenues are factored into the growth. It's platform revenue is growing +70% YoY and already significantly exceeds its hardware revenues.

642,ROKU," I struggle with ROKU. I love their devices and use them, but I'm not here to pick what I need for my TV. I'm here to pick a company that can strategically make money and have some pricing power.

ROKU is set up to be a middle-man between content providers and consumers. Their platform is simple, closest single device that is close to have a level playing field for content providers, and is easy to use and well liked.

The problem I have is where can they strategically make a profit from being the middle man? They have little negotiation pressure over content providers that can rather easily leave and go elsewhere. The switching costs for consumers switching devices is also low.

So this really comes down to hardware sales, sales of marketing information, and sales of an extremely limited subset of advertising.

The hardware is great, the software is great, and the relationship with Nielsen is great. I just want to see more strategic vision of ROKU being able to hold a long-term profit and have some pricing power on more elements of their business.

Many of their competitors are also content providers. They will favor some content, while allowing access to some third party content to gain users. They will have a financial incentive to build cheap and be innovative, because they have more revenue streams in content.

Other competitors, like LG's webOS and Samsung's ecosystem have more to do about them selling larger television, blu-ray players, and other home entertainment systems.

This makes ROKU unique in that they are the closest thing to be a content-provider neutral playing field, but the more they try to make money off that the more I see content providers moving to other options that are subsidized by alternate streams of revenue from ROKU's model.

The the advertising concept is there, but they have to figure out how to deliver more ads, while playing 3rd party apps. They are stuck in an eco-system that is demanding on having non-invasive advertising or they would risk losing consumers or content providers.

They have a first-mover advantage that is large, but the power they have to create revenue streams seems to be weak and if they did they will find competitors.

I want to jump in because of this large advantage at market share, but its negotiation power for increased revenue that concerns me.",cwdawg15,1,/r/stocks/comments/m2vxyl/taking_another_look_at_roku/gqm9d0m/,0.062,0.734,0.204,0.9968

646,ROKU," It is a matter of how overvalued they are or aren't.

Most analyst give them the ability to be fairly valued, while including assumptions of future revenue and earnings growth.

The problem is when the price of the stock goes beyond any expected growth in the coming 4-5 years the risk starts to grow exponentially.

A run of the mill standard dividend stock with a 1.5-2% dividend and a stable, but not growing business might fetch a P/E of 13-20.  Many larger growth companies with a dominant grasp on some markets will fetch a P/E of 20-45. More speculative companies that are still capturing their first markets will fetch anything from 40-150 and up.

It's this latter group you have to watch carefully. You really have to start looking at what risks you're taking and how long it would really take for the business to really be successful at that price. With some popular stocks that are becoming popular, the price is trading at something that would require 10+ years of unaffected positive growth on current trends. 

That would often be called at as overvalued, whereas an analyst might say a company can get there with 5 years growth and they are on a positive trajectory to get there with certain risks acknowledged.

The more future earnings/growth baked into the current price, the riskier it will be and the lower the room for future growth.

Personally I'm not changing anything, just investing monthly into the stocks I already planned on buying.

From TheStreet:

>14 MINUTES AGO  
>  
>The U.S. Treasury sold $24 billion in 30-year bonds Thursday, wrapping up a week where $120 billion in new paper was released into the market, marking one of the sternest tests interest rate markets have endured so far this year.  
>  
>Foreign demand for the long-dated bonds, which are the most sensitive to interest rate changes, fell more than 30 percentage points from the previous sale in early February, with so-called indirect bidders taking just 60.55%. The overall auction yield on the bond sale was 2.295%, up 36.2 basis points from last month, while the bid-to-cover ratio, a key gauge of demand, edged modestly higher, to 2.28 from 2.18.  
>  
>Earlier this week, the [Treasury sold $38 billion in 10-year notes](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/us-10-year-bond-auction-gets-solid-foreign-demand-yields-steady) and $58 billion in 3-year notes in auctions that drew mostly solid foreign demand, with further downward pressure on yields coming prior to the market open when the European Central Bank pledged to¬†[significantly' increase the pace of its monthly asset purchases](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/ecb-pledges-significant-increase-in-bond-purchases-yields-fall) in order to stem the tide of rising bond yields amid a sputtering economic recovery.  
>  
>Benchmark 10-year note yields were marked at 1.518% following results of the 30-year auction,¬†the Dow Jones Industrial Average extended gains, rising 314 points to 32,610 in the wake of the $24 billion sale.  
>  
>This week's bond sales -- part of a $274 billion quarterly funding target that was established before the Senate passed President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion COVID relief bill -- comes amid a modest easing of inflation expectations even as investors look to a faster-than-expected post pandemic recovery and oil prices hover at the highest levels in more than two years.  
>  
>Headline [February CPI was pegged at an annual rate of 1.7%](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/february-inflation-rises-core-pressures-ease-bonds-yields-fall), Commerce Department data indicated Wednesday, but so-called core inflation, which strips out volatile components such as food and energy prices, eased to a monthly pace of 0.1% from the previous month.  
>  
>The so-called breakeven rate between five-year Treasury bonds and five-year inflation protected securities, a key market gauge for consumer price increases, was marked at 2.38%m down from the 2008 high of 2.5% it hit last Wednesday but still firmly ahead of the Fed's 2% inflation target.  
>  
>The Treasury sold $58 billion in 3-year notes at an auction-high yield of 0.335%, with foreign demand falling just below average at 47.8%. Overall demand for the new paper, however, was solid, with bidders seeking $2.69 for every $1 on offer from the government, the highest since June of 2018.

So results are out, and foreign demand up (to be expected, German and Japan yields are trash right now), but prices not high enough to shake the market, but it did inch the 10Y rate up a smidge. I guess the test will come tomorrow if it stays flat/down, or inches up, but looking like that's the last of the bond selling and rates didn't fly up and market still pumping tech stocks, so this may be the sign it keeps going... maybe  :D",whowhatnowhow,3,/r/stocks/comments/m2vpgl/discuss_tech_stocks_up_but_so_are_us10y_yields/gqlnikw/,0.027,0.885,0.089,0.9842

Pros:

\- Many brokers (if not the majority) prefer them over RKT.

694,TDA," I have both Schwab and TDA.   

I can confirm that both Schwab and TDA do both Pink Slips/OTC and (normal markets) extended hours trading which starts at both firms at 7am and ends at 8pm eastern (with the day session in the middle).

TDA also has limited stocks 24x5.

In the day trading tools for each firm, one gets a glimpse into the order book/order completions.   My impression is that the volume is so low outside 7a-8p that losing the 4am-7am window isn't a big loss.

696,IT," The point I might have not made fully:

There are very very few trades going on before 7 am.   Heck, I was just trying to buy some VXUS after 7 am session, and there has been a total of 22 shares exchanged hands.

The spread is 40 cents right now.   I can either buy for 62.90 or sell for 62.50.   I even put a limit order in for 62.63 (the previous day close) and didn't get a taker over the half-hour plus the order was in before I gave up.

This is for an ETF with an average daily volume of around 4 million shares.   Yet only like I said, only 22 have changed hands between 7 and 8 am.  Oh wait, another 7 just exchanged.

There are some holdings I have that there aren't any pre or post-market orders at all on most days.

The reason why this matters is twofold:

1) Most people find that trading in the pre-and-post market sessions isn't really that desirable.  I understand that you do, that's fine.   But with the significantly decreased liquidity and the increased bid/ask spread it isn't for most investors.

2) Because of #1, at some point it doesn't make fiscal sense to keep a brokerage open.   Kinda like how there are fewer options to buy groceries in most towns at 2 am than at 5 pm.    Some places are open 24 hours, but many aren't.

I think the reason why some of the newer brokers like webull and zackstrade do the full market times is that their IT infrastructure is newer and probably is largely hands-off, so it doesn't matter when they trade.

On the other hand, why some of them don't do OTC's and Pink sheets is likely the same reason why others don't do full hours.  Customer demand.

With Interactive Brokers, they have large institutional/hedge fund customers who I'm guessing are paying them for availability all of the time, so their individual customers get to come along for the ride.",Pass_Little,3,/r/stocks/comments/m2n39n/why_arent_brokerages_more_competitive/gqkju5z/,0.015,0.928,0.057,0.8866

728,TSLA," Winners rotate.

QQQ has had an incredible run due to the growth in tech post-2008.  

If you look before 2008 you'll find that VTI was winning.

There are signs that this is getting ready to invert, again.  

In the last 6 months, QQQ had cumulative returns of 6.88% which sounds pretty good.   Until you look at VTI and note that its return was 13.78% over that same period.

The year to date is even worse - QQQ only had 0.13% returns, and VTI was up 2.79%.   Note that this is cumulative so you'd expect the 1-month numbers to be lower.

The point of VTI is that you have the right stocks in your portfolio to be earning no matter what the market is doing.   If tech is hot, VTI is growing.   If more traditional stocks are hot, VTI is growing. And so on.     

With QQQ you are basically betting on a very tech-heavy portfolio, which may or may not be the right thing.   No one knows.    With VTI, you may end up underperforming QQQ, but only if tech stocks continue to be overheated as they've been.  With VTI you may end up overperforming QQQ if tech stocks calm down to be more normal levels of growth.

Note that if you had owned QQQ in 2000, you wouldn't have been very happy (dotcom bubble).   With the hyped-up inflation of TSLA and other tech stocks, you might see a similar thing again.  Or not.

A lot of the underlying analysis of this particular discussion can be found over on r/bogleheads where they're more oriented toward indexes and can probably show you numerous backtests to show why a VTI type approach would have been better in certain decades.   The point of all them can be summarized this way:  You never know what's going to happen in the next 25 years, and something like VTI has a proven track record of doing, on average, better than any market-segment approach when you look at the long-term history of the stock market.",Pass_Little,9,/r/stocks/comments/m2h1gp/vti_vs_qqq_better_for_retiring_early/gqjbxsc/,0.019,0.868,0.112,0.9836

747,TV," I've never taken an economics course or had any experience in the finance world before February. When I was younger I wanted to invest but I didn't have the money nor the know how & didn't know anybody else who did, either.

748,TD," > I just have a few questions how to start investing? 

You can start very easily! Make an account on TD, Vanguard, Webull, or Fidelity (there are a lot of other ones, these are just the bigger named, popular ones). Once you do that, there should be instructions on what to do in order to link a bank account. After that is done, transfer money and you're set.





> what does one invest in? 

That is near impossible to say...there are day traders, there are options (calls/puts), short, value, dividend, etc. THEN there are taxes to worry about, hype (meme stonks), products/services you are for/against ethically, your risk tolerance, time frame, etc.


The safest thing to do is invest in an index fund ETF that follows the S&P 500 (like VOO). The ""S&P 500"" tracks the 500 biggest companies in the US- usually when people say ""The market is down"" or the ""The market is doing great today!"" They are referring to how the S&P 500 is doing. I also recommend this as the first investment. It's safe and diverse (kinda..). You are buying into the 500 biggest US companies.


Next suggestion is: Still ETFs. ETF is usually described as a ""basket"" where other stocks are gathered. So let's say you like technology, you might want to buy VGT because that ETF (basket) holds stocks like Apple, Microsoft, NVIDIA, and so on. One thing you want to look out for is ""Expense Ratio."" That's how much you pay to have your ""basket"" managed (not like out of pocket, they just automatically take the money from the funds). Some ETFs are .03% and that ranges up to something like .75% (and some are even more). Seems like a tiny amount, but if you invest for long term it adds up.



For individual stock picks...that's up to you. Take ideas from the internet, but you need to check it out yourself. This is where things get hard. You need to learn the language, read the news, read the financial reports, read, maybe watch a few YT videos, news videos, Google news, just keep reading.




> How to know when and when not to invest? 

Hard to say. If you have money to spare, invest. If you have debts to pay off...maybe pay that first. Let's say you get a 10% return on your investment (which is pretty good!) but your debt is costing you 25% interest. There are different strategies and loopholes of course, but I would pay away debts first.


* Don't invest money that you need to survive. Make sure you have funding for your NEEDS (rent/mortgage, insurance, food, utilities, etc). Wants like movies, fancy dinners, luxury brands, etc can go away.


> And does the amount you invest matter initially? 

Most people say no. I'd say yes.


I put in 1k. That was enough for me to stay interested, but not enough to sink my life if it were to turn to $0. If I put in $10 and lost it, it's just a bad experience. If I lost that 1k, I would want to know why. 


Also, seeing that 1k go up and down was a good gauge for me. You don't want to feel like you need to cut your losses at every dip, same as how you don't want to throw in another grand at every green light.

754,JP," from some guy on yahoo finance:

""VWAGY vs. VWAPY vs. POAHY  


There seems to be some real confusion about the stocks for VW. (POAHY is technically a holding company called Porsche automobile, but they are part of the VW world). I will not refer to the German share names of VOW, VOW3, and POAHF, but the 1/10 shares listed in the US. But the same definitions apply.  


VWAGY - The ordinary shares that have voting rights when purchased on the Frankfurt exchange.  


VWAPY - The preference shares that have NO voting rights when purchased on the Frankfurt exchange. They are not like preferred shares as defined in the US (a stock/bond hybrid). They are no different than VWAGY minus the voting rights. They are a share of the VW company.  


POAHY - The Porsche Auto holding company that owns 50.1% of the voting rights. They do this via 30.3% ownership of VWAGY stock. The valuation of POAHY should be exactly 30.3 % of VW if you went by book value of the shares. (It‚Äôs usually way under this and sells at a 30% discount. )  


I own all 3, but I love a discount so I own far more of POAHY and VWAPY than VWAGY.  


I will give some history on why VWAGY has a premium to VWAPY and why it no longer matters. I will do this using todays symbols to make it easier to understand, but the symbols were different back then for the shares. In 2008, Porsche wanted to get control of VW, so they started buying up VWAGY. This caused a huge share price difference between VWAGY and VWAPY of $100. Hedge funds pounced on the arbitrage play and shorted VWAGY and went long VWAPY as they knew they should be equal in value for the most part. (example - Google voting shares trade for a 5% premium vs non-voting shares). This was a risk free trade for the hedge funds, except Porsche had used options to lock up the entire float of VWAGY. Shares in VWAGY skyrocketed and in 2008 during the short squeeze of VWAGY, VW had the highest market cap in the world.  


Now fast forward to now. Porsche Auto (POAHY) owns 50.1% of the voting rights to VW. So why buy a voting stock when your vote doesn‚Äôt matter. I‚Äôm not even sure JP Morgan allows a vote with VWAGY given that it‚Äôs an ADR, but even if they did, Porsche owns the company. Your vote doesn‚Äôt count. But, the price difference between the two could continue forever, but not if there is an event that changes the status quo.  


That event is a possible Porsche spin-off. Lets do the math using a $100,000 purchase of VWAGY or VWAPY today. We will also assume the Porsche spin-off gives us 1 share of Porsche for every share of VWAPY or VWAGY we own (it wouldn‚Äôt, but lets avoid math problems).  


100,000 of VWAGY is 3424 shares.  
100,000 of VWAPY is 4291 shares.  


If I buy VWAPY, I get an extra 865 Porsche shares once they do the spin-off. That is real money and since I have no voting rights anyway with the holding company owning 50.1% of the voting stock, I will take my 865 extra Porsche shares rather than some vote that doesn‚Äôt matter. If there is no spin-off, then there is no catalyst to reduce the spread, but if it happens, VWAGY and VWAPY will be the same price on the day of the Porsche share delivery. The math all but guarantees it. Everyone loves free shares of stock.  


As for POAHY, I buy a lot of it as well because they will get a big boost and the discount will shrink because they 30.4% of the Porsche shares. (Porsche Auto is simply a holding company to control VW, it‚Äôs not the Porsche Stock that will be spun-off). The discounts on holding companies are always small on hot stocks and large on laggards. This stock is heating up and the discount will shrink and the market cap will also go up with VW.  


I still own a lot of VWAGY (15% of my total in VW) as I buy all 3, but I see some extra value in VWAPY and POAHY and a possible 15% kicker of extra Porsche shares with VWAPY if the Porsche Spin-off happens.""

The overall trend of the XLV could be reflected in each of these stocks to the T, thus mimicking each other, or one could be an outlier.

777,LUV," The reopening stocks I own are DAL, BA, LVS and DIS. I picked up all of these last year. Note that some airlines (like DAL) tend to be more reliant on business travel vs leisure travel. I would say LUV is more leisure travel focused. Leisure travel will come back first. I would swap to a different airline stock, but my cost basis is low 20s for DAL and I don't want to get taxed at short term cap gains rate. I'm just selling covered calls on that position now with a strike just under pre covid highs.

781,FCF," Levered free cash flow is the free cash flow available to all capital providers (i.e. it excludes interest payments to debt holders), while free cash flow is the cash flow available to equity holders (i.e. the interest payments are removed). So in your case it makes sense because the free cash flow available to all capital providers is positive, while the free cash flow available to equity holders is negative (which would mean interest payments are the reason).

Another reason could be that the company paid down its debt rather than reinvest or pay out dividends, which could also be a reason that one is positive and the other is negative.

For context, one formula for levered FCF = Net Income + pre-tax interest + non-cash charges - fixed capital investments - working capital investments. This would be the cash available to all capital providers.

FCF to equity holders = levered FCF - pre-tax interest + net borrowings. This removes the interest expense and adds net borrowings (it should be obvious that net borrowing should increase the cash available to equity-holders)",simonkesterlian,2,/r/stocks/comments/m2q4yh/levered_free_cash_flow_vs_free_cash_flow/gqkmhmu/,0.075,0.717,0.208,0.9819

783,FCF," Well if you're an equity investor, it wouldn't be good because that would mean there's no free cash flow left for you. But, if it is a start-up for example, it would make sense that there's no FCF left.
