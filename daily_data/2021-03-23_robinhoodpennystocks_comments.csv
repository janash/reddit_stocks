15,GME," Well at least he was honest by telling he doesn't know much. Remember that before taking any of the advice people!!

Although, I do agree with the premise of leaving robinhood. Not because of what has been said in this post, but more because I foresee another GME like fiasco happening. Robinhood doesn't have deep enough coffers (at least yet) to cover all retail trades so a clearing house (in this case Citadel) can easily make them do what they want.

Edit: I just read through some of the later parts of the post. I think the funniest would have to be ""The point of buying a stock is to purchase at the lowest possible price then when the stock increases your cost basis is lower and your percent gain can be slightly higher"". If only I knew all I had to do was buy low sell high!",Rmandhana1998,1,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/mb4crh/leave_robinhood_now_they_are_literally_scalping/grx5eno/,0.081,0.776,0.143,0.8529

17,RH, Open an account at a different brokerage and have them transfer it. Td Ameritrade didn’t charge me to transfer. But you’ll need to sell your crypto and fractional shares from RH first.

18,RH, That's quite possibly due to the Greeks and you not understanding what they mean. You can even have a stock gain in price but your option decreases in price because of time and volatility  or your stock shat the bed. Each option contract represents control 100 shares. Any movement is times 100. A share goes up $1 you make $100. If the option is expected to be at your strike price and takes its sweet time getting there value can be lost i think thats called theta decay. Just because your option lost 70% of value does not mean RH is at fault. Its a shit app for other reasons and its never a bad thing to transfer out. You can transfer funds and stocks to a new broker without selling and being hit w taxes at least right away.,Plate-toe,11,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/mb4crh/leave_robinhood_now_they_are_literally_scalping/grwaedc/,0.122,0.743,0.135,0.2789
19,RH," Last I read, fidelity will cover the $75 fee if you’re moving in $2k or more. But as far as I know when you do import your positions over you still lose your stats like average cost and such, and crypto and fractions of shares are auto liquidated

77,ETH," I half expect 10y yield to spike and stocks to crater on 3/31-4/2. I dug into this last night and banks have been bitching about the plan to let SLR exemptions expire for weeks. That was amplified on Friday when Powell said they wouldn’t extend the SLR exemptions but might adjust them in the future if needed. When it was announced Friday, 10y jumped to 1.75%. I suspect that was also part of the reason for so much red yesterday. Banks are apt to dump at least some of their 10y Treasurys on or before 3/31 to offset the loss of the exemption and the 10y yield runs inverse to the supply. It may already be priced into the market by 3/31 or maybe not. I was toying with the idea of selling off everything before 3/31 and just leaving my $ in my account as 3/31 is a big question mark. If the 10y spikes up to 2% or more on 3/30 or 3/31, it will effect everything if it hasn’t already been priced in. 10y yield increase = downward pressure on stock prices.    On the other hand, If it spikes and adds substantial inflationary fears, it might also spike BTC, ETH and other crypto. People used to run to gold and other PMs when inflation fear peaked but as Powell said just a few days ago “Bitcoin is more of a substitute for gold than it is for the dollar”. That also makes me curious about all the hit job articles on BTC this last week - some people may be trying to drive the price down for a cheaper buy in.

Isn't it though? Track some of the stocks after super positive DDs have been posted, they're mostly total losers. This sub is full of bag holders who diversify penny stock investments that just slowly trickle their money away. It's full of total newbies. 

Trading penny stocks is about taking gambles on risky shit companies at the slightest hint of positive news, mostly premarket and then you pump and dump. You can't even buy OTC penny stocks on robin hood, and those are the ones with the potential of hitting it big. People on this sub are just playing around with cash as they lose it. This isn't an investing sub, it's a hobbyist sub, and this hobby is costing most of you money.

154,IMO, Zom is a buy for long term and and no longer appealing to those looking for a quick buck. Look for 5-10 dollars EOY and 2.50 by next earnings. The reason it went down recently is because of the early release of the product. The ceo was aware of Reddit based hype and there was a high number of shares out there and a belief that a lot of people were gonna sell at the end of March. He released the product early to lower the price and get those looking for a quick profit out because their were so many. If he waiting for the 30th the price would have been higher and the drop would have been even worse. He made the right decision for the company and for the benefit of those in it for the long run. IMO it’s a huge buy right now added some shares today.
