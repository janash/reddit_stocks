8,AMC," Honest opinion from someone that’s starting with $400 that is also doing options only: 

This is really tough to do. You make money on short term options when stocks move fast. Unlike stocks you not only have to be right about the direction of the stock, you have to be precise on where it lands in a hyper specific time frame. 10x on options is possible but difficult even with tons of time, research, and expertise.

As someone that’s done almost 200% returns in a month I’d say the biggest thing to this success would be learning options thoroughly and being hyper confident on your 3-5 plays. Personally my big winners were never penny stocks (BMBL puts, IPOE calls and AMC calls).",Vile-Affliction,2,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/nk9r8h/reached_a_goal_today_a_month_of_strictly_options/gzd3ras/,0.034,0.826,0.14,0.9478

I would say that I’ve felt very confident in my past few positions when entering them so that allowed me to avoid any panic selling!

You can still buy those 30-45 DTEs, although I’d recommend coming in closer to something like 10-14 DTE, and just scalp a little off the top here and there. It’s not all about being a millionaire off a single trade. Slow and consistent traders also become rich. It’s just the difference in the timeframe they do it.

The TL:DW is that the longer out the DTE the higher premium you’ll pay for the extrinsic (time) value.

23,SAF," Sundial Growers
Like it or not, Sundial Growers remains a favored name among retail traders. It was one of the hot penny stocks on Reddit earlier in the year as traders flocked to the stock. Soon after reaching highs of $3.96 this year, SNDL stock tumbled. The company had gone on a capital-raising spree to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars. It has also been a frequent name on the list of most active stocks in the market, daily.
Besides profit-taking, a key reason for the stock decline is equity dilution. However, it seems that the worst is over in terms of the downside. After a series of capital fundraising, the company has a stronger cash buffer to fund its growth over the coming one to two years. 
Earlier in May, Sundial announced the acquisition of Canadian recreational cannabis retailer Inner Spirit Holdings Ltd. That would put Sundial in a stronger position in the market. Besides, Sundial announced its first-quarter results on Wednesday. In it, the company saw its first quarter of positive adjusted EBITDA in Sundial’s history, at $3.3 million. With these achievements, would you be adding SNDL stock to your portfolio?

SNDL stock is another cannabis stock worth considering. The stock touched a high of $3.96 in February 2021 and has corrected sharply to current levels of 76 cents per share.

The correction has been on profit-book and significant equity dilution. With the capital raising program, the company reported cash and equivalents of $873.5 million as of the first quarter.

With strong financial flexibility, Sundial seems positioned to pursue aggressive organic and inorganic growth. In May, the company announced the acquisition of Inner Spirit for a consideration of $131 million. The franchiser and operator of retail cannabis stores already has 86 stores in operation. In the fourth quarter of 2020, Inner Spirit reported $9.2 million in revenue and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 19%.

Sundial also has a 50-50 joint venture with SAF Group. The company has committed $188 million towards the joint venture to invest in equity, debt and hybrid instruments globally in the cannabis sector.

The company reported 74% branded cannabis sales for the first quarter. Sundial also reported a positive adjusted EBITDA of $3.3 million for the quarter. EBITDA growth was supported by revenue of $15.7 million from cannabis related portfolio investments.

It seems that SNDL stock has bottomed out. With the current cash buffer, it’s likely that revenue and EBITDA growth will accelerate in the coming quarters.",Bobofsky,1,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/nks5qw/another_195_shares_bought_today_a_little_each_day/gzfv6mv/,0.029,0.849,0.122,0.9874

27,SNDL," If the US opens the border with Canada for marijuana trade, SNDL has the opportunity to come into the US. Just a dream. 

As for comparing them to Apple, when Apple was trading at around $.22 in 1982 people were talking smack about them. That $.22 is equivalent to $.61 today. 

SNDL isn’t about to go under. A stock I wish I had jumped on was SiriusXM in 2008 when the stock was at $.12 per share. People were taking about Sirius going bankrupt and I hesitated and looked elsewhere to invest. About a year later the stock was over $1.00 and has been over $7 a bunch of times since.
