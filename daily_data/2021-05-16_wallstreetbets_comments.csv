I have a subscription but cancel it each month then renew when I want to watch again, saves some money if I don't use it for a week or whatnot.   


The thing Disney+ provides and arguably their market is the obsessives (but it is flat per month) and parents with kids. There's no way they'll reach Netflix level coverage with their vault offerings + Mando alone so they're fairly capped on subscribers.   


Now that's really not a huge issue because they have a ton of different income streams: release movies, merch, the parks and now the digital side (but they were making money licensing before so.. not sure if that's a net gain but likely smart for the future).",Teripid,11,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ndok5d/dis_yolo_one_million_dollar_loss/gycqi5i/,0.076,0.795,0.128,0.7935

124,UWMC," Strong Earnings last week and an announced $300m buyback. Short borrow fee has skyrocketed with zero shorts available to borrow.

Buyback puts pressure on shorts and will force them to cover higher, causing a squeeze.

166,OI," It's not so much that anyone is ""trying"" to pin it at $7.50.  Is just a natural, normal, expected result of continuous delta hedging and high OI at a strike close to the current price, with other strikes being far away.

181,UWMC," > Since delta is the chance that the option expires ITM, the time before expiry and the volatility of the stock also affect the delta.

My understanding is that delta measures the change in value of an option when the price of the underlying increases by $1. I know delta increases the further ITM an option is, but can it really be used to measure the probability that it expires ITM?

For instance, UWMC is at $7.51. Looking at 18 Jun calls, $7 strike has a .67 delta while $8 strike only has .42 delta. Shouldn't they both have similar chances of expiring ITM, since the underlying is right between them?",buoybuoy,0,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ndcm0p/uwmc_is_a_powderkeg_low_float_high_short_huge/gycj7cp/,0.031,0.918,0.051,0.3094

183,UWMC," The 7$ strike is already in the money, while the 8$strike is still out of the money. If the share price of UWMC were to stay flat until June 18th (though I personally hope it will moon this week), the 7c option would get a delta of 1 at expiry, while the 8c option would go to a 0 in delta eventually. For the 8c to be itm, the share price has to increase by about 8%, while the 7c already is itm and has intrinsic value. Therefore a 7c is seen as much more likely and will therefore have a higher delta. Ofc, if UMWC rallies this week, both calls will be itm and end with a delta of 1. Then the 8c will most likely have a larger % increase in price since the change in delta will be larger. It is true that delta reflects the change in price of the underlying, but that is because it reflects the chance of being itm at expiry and thus the option will have that many out of the 100 shares hedged for. This will show up in the price increase or decrease.

228,DD," I had done a DD on UWMC sometime back. Hope you find it useful (might be a bit dated but fundementals still remain the same)  
  
Core Product  
  
United Wholesale Mortgage (UWM) underwrites loans for mortgage brokers, banks and credit unions. It doesn't lend directly to borrowers. Instead, they are simply the facilitator and underwriter. What they mainly provide is consumers, lenders and institutions a simple process by which they can apply, compare and complete a mortgage application. They currently have one of the fastest and most effective consumer to lender processes due to their heavy investments into IT infrastructure (UWMC‚Äôs mortgage process takes an average of 17 days from start to finish when compared to the industry average of 47 days)  
  
Financials  
  
UWM had a stellar year in 2020 and it reflects in its financials.  
  
UWM reported 4Q20 net income of $1.37 billion and FY20 net income of $3.38 billion, an 821% and 715% increase over 4Q19 and FY19 respectively. Their total loan volume amount for 2020 was $182.5B which was 69% higher than 2019.  
  
Cash in hand also rose from 133M in 4Q-19 to 1.22B in 4Q-20. Credit quality of the loans improved with the weighted average FICO of 757 for the full year of 2020. This brought down the 60+ delinquency rates well below the industry average. UWMC also just declared its first regular quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share on the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock. The dividend is payable on April 6, 2021 to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 10, 2021.  
  
Potential and Hype Factors  
  
Russell index addition: UWMC is expected to be added into Russell 1000 and Russell 3000 index by end of March. This will force all the funds tracking these indices to add UWMC to their portfolio possibly driving the stock price higher.  
  
Technology moat: UWMC invests heavily in IT infrastructure and technology. They develop all their technology with in-house developers. They have developed tools such as Blink+, UWM InTouch, and Brand 360 which enables them to have an industry-leading close time (almost twice as fast as Rocket and 3x as fast as the industry average)  
  
Short interest: While the company is in no way similar to some meme stock case in short interest (up to 140% which was a very rare event), it still is at 31% which is significantly higher than average. (source: fintel.io)  
  
NPS score: They currently have the happiest customers among their competition with an NPS score 16% higher than that of Rocket (which is at 2nd place).  
  
Risk and Competition  
  
75% of the mortgage volume was based on refinancing ($42.9B new mortgages, $139.3B refinancing). This is predominantly driven by declining mortgage rates. If the mortgage rates increase, then UWMC‚Äôs refinancing volume will take a significant hit bringing down their revenues.  
  
There is a lot of discussion around this being one of the reasons UWMC went public so as to capitalize on the refinance boom. I don‚Äôt completely buy this argument as company executives themselves are solidifying their position (Director of $UWMC just reported his SEC form 4, showing he more than doubled his own position on March 1st, from 50k to 110k shares).  
  
The full impact of UWMC‚Äôs CEO's surprise announcement that they wouldn‚Äôt work with mortgage brokers that work with Rocket or Fairway Independent Mortgage is still not clear. UWMC has said that the split will take effect from March 15th.  
  
Conclusion  
  
This is the first time in my experience that a trending stock that has solid fundamentals is generating revenue, is profitable, and has no debt. Although there are some risks in terms of mortgage rates and the surprise announcement, I think the current market conditions put UWMC in a very strong position as a long-term play.",nobjos,10,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nds2vh/i_built_a_program_that_tracks_mentions_and/gycdv3c/,0.031,0.845,0.124,0.9965

Core Product  
  
United Wholesale Mortgage (UWM) underwrites loans for mortgage brokers, banks and credit unions. It doesn't lend directly to borrowers. Instead, they are simply the facilitator and underwriter. What they mainly provide is consumers, lenders and institutions a simple process by which they can apply, compare and complete a mortgage application. They currently have one of the fastest and most effective consumer to lender processes due to their heavy investments into IT infrastructure (UWMC‚Äôs mortgage process takes an average of 17 days from start to finish when compared to the industry average of 47 days)  
  
Financials  
  
UWM had a stellar year in 2020 and it reflects in its financials.  
  
UWM reported 4Q20 net income of $1.37 billion and FY20 net income of $3.38 billion, an 821% and 715% increase over 4Q19 and FY19 respectively. Their total loan volume amount for 2020 was $182.5B which was 69% higher than 2019.  
  
Cash in hand also rose from 133M in 4Q-19 to 1.22B in 4Q-20. Credit quality of the loans improved with the weighted average FICO of 757 for the full year of 2020. This brought down the 60+ delinquency rates well below the industry average. UWMC also just declared its first regular quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share on the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock. The dividend is payable on April 6, 2021 to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 10, 2021.  
  
Potential and Hype Factors  
  
Russell index addition: UWMC is expected to be added into Russell 1000 and Russell 3000 index by end of March. This will force all the funds tracking these indices to add UWMC to their portfolio possibly driving the stock price higher.  
  
Technology moat: UWMC invests heavily in IT infrastructure and technology. They develop all their technology with in-house developers. They have developed tools such as Blink+, UWM InTouch, and Brand 360 which enables them to have an industry-leading close time (almost twice as fast as Rocket and 3x as fast as the industry average)

242,GM," Nikola Motor Company (NKLA) makes me think of ""companies"" like Bre-X Minerals & Theranos.

This is a company that mislead investors in an (IMHO) criminal way.

The founder has from multiple sources a long history of scamming people by selling businesses under false pretenses and information.

He took capital money and hired his friends and family who have no experience or expertise.  His brother was in the hydrogen technology department despite being a basic home repairs guy laying concrete driveways his whole life...

The only money on the books for the company was the founder (who as you mentioned got kicked out of his own company) putting money on the books for sales to him...

The company and old founder first lied about the technology existing, then promised huge rebuttals on social media.  Then made all the social media private, then ghosted social media all together...

It has went back down to IPO price only this time all the hopes and promises that made it launch at around $9-10 a share don't exist.

No one in any formal business sense wants to touch this company with a 10 foot pole.

They offered free cash and free stock to GM and even GM after discussion realized the association was so bad for business they turned down free stock and free capital....

For the investors that were in NKLA before all the lies and in my opinion fraud came out they should join the countless class action lawsuits, write to the DOJ and SEC to continue their investigations, and write to their local and state representatives to push for investigations as they people were taken advantage of and this business and those at the executive level failed in their fiduciary duty to the shareholders.

The people investing since the news broke and riding it all down to IPO price from around 70-80 are beyond cult kool aid level.  Lol it says something when even WSB gamblers mock a bunch of people for being ignorant.

If the executive team cared at all about the shareholders they would take the remaining capital and assets and merge with a respectable company pursuing hydrogen tech (if you agree with it or not) and lose the name and the history and give the shareholders a chance at some future or at least tech development.

295,ABC," Its tricky with legacy content on streaming - my understanding is that most of the traditional tv industry is built around keeping the production side at arms length from the distribution side, with profit participants in between.

In order to repatriate Friends, HBO Max had to outbid Netflix for its own content, with the stars continuing to get paid out.

When Disney bought Fox Family, they mistakenly thought they could reair ABC content gir cheap, but those kinds of deals weren't in place. Source: Disneywar

ABC ended up getting sued for Who Wants to be a Millionaire reruns and for generally underpaying for the hit show through self dealing. They had to pay out millions of dollars is my understanding. 

Similarly, AMC is currently being sued by several of the producers of The Walking Dead in at least two lawsuits, although the preliminary judgements seem to be going in their favour on that front.

Most streaming shows are being produced on the basis of paying out the backend up front, aka the Netflix model, which has also been the norm for Canadian television for quite some time if not forever.  Hence, CTV/Bell owns the backend on Corner Gas.

In the case of Viacom, my understanding is that the Redstone family through National Amusements owns the majority of voting rights for Viacom, so any takeover would depend on what Shari Redstone wants to do.
