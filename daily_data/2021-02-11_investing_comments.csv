I mean sure, I'm jealous that people are getting rich on stocks like GME and Tesla, but that doesn't mean that those people are inherently ""wrong.""

They're exploiting the system to make money which is literally everyone's goal.

Also, screw the author of the article for literally only mentioning one stock that is doing well and then somehow lumping Bitcoin and Doge into the mix with no context.",staniel_diverson,609,/r/investing/comments/lhkjqr/the_worst_stocks_are_doing_the_best/gmy0b4a/,0.141,0.764,0.095,-0.6187
1,AM," I lost my job last year. Started to take a key interest in the stock market in December. I decided to jump in with 20k EUR, and made 14,665 EUR profit, before tax, in 2 weeks and 2 days. 

I've now exited all my positions for the time being.

I did not play GME or AMC, this is purely based on momentum trading and some swings.

My takeaway of the current market as a neophyte who enjoys learning and reading, and has immersed himself into this field:

\-> There are a number of areas that work on the weekly including Biochem, China education stocks and shipping stocks. You can buy low, sell high with these, at least for the last two weeks a lot of volatility in these stocks

\-> Biochem has amazing catalysts, look at what Kempharm is doing and how that is evolving now. Do good DD, invest in good Biochem, and you're a winner.

\-> Weed stocks are dangerous, but getting a lot of love right now. I made a few thousand on SNDL and KERN, but have exited my positions. I think KERN is too limited and will likely lose out to SAP or some other ERP supplier when the weed companies get bigger. I don't like the catalysts for weed, but if good weed news happens in the AM, then you can buy ZYNE/KERN/etc. who all benefit and usually one going up will trigger the others

This is what I've been doing for 2 weeks, and made my profit. I'm now taking a break to change broker and learn more, because I know something bad is coming, I can feel it. I'm learning to do better DD, setting up better news feeds so I can be on time and not miss major catalysts, and am learning more about different fields.

I will say this: right now the market is artificial. It is propped-up by two things: the US administration pumping out USD like it is free money (I mean it is), and the retail investor rush. Both of these things are quite bad for the long run.

Furthermore, look at some videos from 2008. What we are living right now makes no sense. Markets at an all time high, yet bad unemployment numbers, a global pandemic, a lot of deaths, poverty, etc. It makes no sense and feels like a bubble. Tech is so high right now. What happened in 2008? Look at how tech stocks got wrecked, mad stuff.

I'd say that fundamentals are out of the window for day traders and swing traders, and it is all about momentum (at least for retail traders). I would also go as far as saying that any investment right now is very risky, so take care if investing in ETFs/long term stock portfolio/ and even real estate. I read an article today about the UK housing market taking a beating soon due to: job losses, increased poverty, decreased income and purchasing power. Well guess what? These things are happening in the US too, the only difference is that the UK government is not printing money right now like the fed is.

16,AMC," I think you can attribute this pretty solidly to the explosion in retail investing.

AstraZeneca is a relatively boring blue chip stock. The company is in a bit more of a spotlight right now because of the vaccine, but, even then, the vaccine's lack of effectiveness against the new variants hurts any boom narrative.

In general, a blue chip pharma company just isn't the sort of YOLO opportunity that retail investors are looking for.

The retail investing is focusing more on fun stocks. People might still have their investment savings with their bank, being invested in blue chips, but the money they are investing in retail is their fun money. That's the new money that's flowing into the market right now, which is why it is flowing into fun stocks.

GME is a fun stock. A lot of millennials grew up in Game Stop locations, and gaming is a fun industry. The anti-hedge fund narrative around the stock helped to massively increase the hype.

AMC is a fun stock. It's not a very well run company, but everyone loves movies, and there is a real narrative around saving an iconic movie company that people love.

The weed stock craze that's going on over the past week is a similar thing. Again, people love weed, and the potential of federal legalization gives the industry a natural growth narrative. It's the same thing that happened with Canadian legalization a few years back, except in a much bigger US market.

The point is that, if you are a company like AstraZeneca, you aren't going after the retail investor market. You are going after institutional value investors, but that's not the money that's flowing into the market right now, so their growth hasn't been that good.

As such, that's why I am looking at investing in some of the sort of businesses that are likely to be able to catch that retail wave. Right now, the two I am highest on are [SCR.TO](https://SCR.TO) (Score Media and Gaming), and EGLX.TO (Enthusiast Gaming). They are both TSX listed companies, but both have pending applications for NASDAQ listings, which should come to fruition in the next month or two, providing strong near-term catalysts. The Score is a sports betting play. They have the second most used sports app in North America, and have entered the sports betting market in New Jersey, to great success, while legislation is currently pending to legalize single event sports betting in their home market of Canada, as well as other legislation to open up several other states. Meanwhile, TGLX is probably the best pure eSports play on the market, having built North America's largest gaming network. They own multiple esports teams (Luminosity, Vancouver Titans, Seattle Surge), as well as a huge network of game specific websites (over 100), YouTube channels (over 1,000) and influencers (over 500).

Both companies have huge growth prospects, forthcoming catalysts, and meet the criteria for catching the retail investing craze. But, for boring blue chip companies like AstraZeneca it isn't surprising that they are failing to cash in on the current wave, since they just don't fit the criteria of what retail investors are looking for, and that's what is currently driving growth in the market.",LemmingPractice,4,/r/investing/comments/lhkjqr/the_worst_stocks_are_doing_the_best/gmyhnnw/,0.061,0.749,0.19,0.9983

42,GME," In a lot of ways the people playing Tesla and those that got in on GME for the short squeeze are right.  They played the market as it is very well. This isnt the first time that the stock market has become detached from the fundamentals and it wont be the last. Anyone that has even cursory understanding of the markets history would be able to point out many different times where its happened. The price of stocks grow faster then the companies themselves grow. People have always said that their bull market was different and was going to continue indefinitely. Eventually things always return to the fundamentals, but untill that does happen and people remember that they can lose money in the market prices will continue to climb well beyond where they “should” be.",Melkor1000,9,/r/investing/comments/lhkjqr/the_worst_stocks_are_doing_the_best/gmyza1f/,0.034,0.91,0.056,0.27
43,GME," I've thrown out any strategy I had before GME for about half my portfolio. As long as it seems to work I use that to momentum trade. Exactly what you say, exploiting the system to make money.

That Sundial stock made me thousands and I was only in for a day and a half. I took the profits and reinvested them in stocks I do plan on holding long like an ETF. I'll continue to hold a small base position in the original stock but look to ride another retail pump and dump stock. It'll work until it doesn't. Eventually the market will calm down after COVID and I'll go back to a more long term hold and accumulate strategy.

I think we’re very recently just seeing a trove of Millennials and Gen Zers get involved in the market using a different set of tools with a different philosophy than what the market has seen before. You can round up a bunch of people on a given social media platform to rally behind one stock and flip a quick profit.

All of those picks (minus Nikola) are from companies that are currently expected not only to lead the market but to actually create whole new market sectors. They're detached from fundamentals because a good chunk of what 'fundamentals' actually are from a financial statement analysis perspective is based on an accepted understanding of the financial dynamics of the sector in which the company operates. When disruptors come along, their financials are often difficult to fit to the models because they violate expected growth assumptions for the sector writ large. 

The valuations we're witnessing could be easily explained by a market consensus that we are in the middle of the Tesla's and Shopify's of the world cleaving themselves from existing sectors to define whole new ones. 

Whether you consider that consensus irrational speculation is determined by whether you think 'fundamentals' (or at least how you evaluate them) are static or whether you leave some room in your definition of fundamentals to expect that the dynamics within a sector can change completely over the course of your investing horizon. 

Personally, I leave room for both. I have a vast chunk of my portfolio in assets that I believe are reasonably adherent to their 'fundamentals' split between high and low risk, but I also leave a smaller slice for these kinds of momentum plays. It's my philosophy that it's an extremely helpful tool for a retail trader because it gives you an outlet for your FOMO feelings and permission to put some of your money into potential moonshots that you believe the market is underpricing based on personal experience (mine in the last 12 months have been TSLA, HEXO, and FTRP for example). 

At the end of the day, to each their own. Some people don't have the instinct for these kinds of picks. Some people don't have the patience and discipline to stick with those picks through volatility. It may be a terrible strategy for many simply due to biases in investor behaviour. There's also the survivorship bias of being part of a historically bullish market. I'll be the first to say it's not a perfect strategy because I know that a perfect strategy doesn't actually exist. All I know is that it works for me. It seems to work for others.

117,RNA," Awesome post, thanks alot.

I'm a physician but got no idea about stocks just started trying to figure this out, but your pointers have helped! Especially the last part about marketing. 

I decided to play on risky bio tech companies. Been watching crisper therapeutics the last four years (i still remember following the patent drama befoe the nobel prize) and after the RNA vaccine got a conditional marketing license with roll-out review, all biotech almost leaped. I guess it helped with public weariness of these things.

I know the rule is always diversify, but dont have the heart or money to invest in crisper & Intellia therap. Plus Editas Medicine who is backed by Novartis ( crisper thep.'s rival). 

I backed Crisper Therap because products are further in clinical evaluation, their budget is safe(600mil?), supported by Vertex pharm & Bayer plus incase they do get an FDA approval their marketing should be strong, the news that they hired Philippe Drouet as Chief Commercial Officer 2 weeks ago says something to me about their own perception of their products. Another upside is that if one of their product (and thet have the most on the pipeline) fails, well the genome is rich to try their tech on another disease.

I love the question though and it really lets me talk about the medicine from a business standpoint. Doctors come in two flavors, creates of habit, and lovers of the new. Creatures of habit rarely pick up stuff like new drugs right away (many will go their whole career without trying something new). The difference though, is in those specialized drugs that aren't used on everyone. For example, a drug to treat a rare mutation of cystic fibrosis, you can bet every single specialist on cystic fibrosis will know about it and be watching for data on efficacy. So that's kind of a nuance and understanding who treats what, and at what level. When a patient is referred to a specialist vs when a general practitioner will be able to care for them. 

Now, onto your specific question. ~~Hepatitis B is not a vaccine that we give routinely.~~ The only indications I can think of at the top of my head are military and hepatitis C **and the fact that there is multi-vaccine series at birth**. We MAY give them for people traveling to high risk areas (though I doubt it). I know the military gives them routinely. It's also standard of care to vaccinate someone who has not been exposed to hepatitis B when they develop chronic hepatitis C infection. The reason we generally don't care about hepatitis B is because the vast majority of cases resolve on their own (exact number escapes me but it is >80%). We only vaccinate hepatitis C patients against it because we don't want to cause further liver damage. That said, most people with positive hepatitis C labs also already have had hepatitis B or were previously vaccinated so they would get no benefit from vaccination.

From a marketing standpoint, the best bet then becomes the military. GSK has a wider reach than this company so I doubt VBIV will be able to compete for that contract. I imagine their drug will also be more expensive than GSK so most hospitals won't use it. 

I guess what I'm saying is that these guys have a lot of hurdles to overcome. Can they do it? Anything is possible. But, the odds are heavily stacked against them. Big pharma has many advantages.

EDIT: my edit is that I think the market exists but can they really prove to large hospital conglomerates to use this vaccine on newborns? That's the big market here, and the key thing to even look at is if their studies are even being done in the newborn population.

We only vaccinate hepatitis C patients against it because we don't want to cause further liver damage. That said, most people with positive hepatitis C labs also already have had hepatitis B or were previously vaccinated so they would get no benefit from vaccination.

From a marketing standpoint, the best bet then becomes the military. GSK has a wider reach than this company so I doubt VBIV will be able to compete for that contract. I imagine their drug will also be more expensive than GSK so most hospitals won't use it. 

I guess what I'm saying is that these guys have a lot of hurdles to overcome. Can they do it? Anything is possible. But, the odds are heavily stacked against them. Big pharma has many advantages.

EDIT: my edit is that I think the market exists but can they really prove to large hospital conglomerates to use this vaccine on newborns?

121,VBIV," Thanks I'm happy I could have helped. I will say, though, that investing and waiting for an FDA decision is akin to gambling. Playing the market and riding the hype, I do that all the time and it can be very profitable. 

I love the question though and it really lets me talk about the medicine from a business standpoint. Doctors come in two flavors, creates of habit, and lovers of the new. Creatures of habit rarely pick up stuff like new drugs right away (many will go their whole career without trying something new). The difference though, is in those specialized drugs that aren't used on everyone. For example, a drug to treat a rare mutation of cystic fibrosis, you can bet every single specialist on cystic fibrosis will know about it and be watching for data on efficacy. So that's kind of a nuance and understanding who treats what, and at what level. When a patient is referred to a specialist vs when a general practitioner will be able to care for them. 

Now, onto your specific question. ~~Hepatitis B is not a vaccine that we give routinely.~~ The only indications I can think of at the top of my head are military and hepatitis C **and the fact that there is multi-vaccine series at birth**. We MAY give them for people traveling to high risk areas (though I doubt it). I know the military gives them routinely. It's also standard of care to vaccinate someone who has not been exposed to hepatitis B when they develop chronic hepatitis C infection. The reason we generally don't care about hepatitis B is because the vast majority of cases resolve on their own (exact number escapes me but it is >80%).

135,EV," I did a fair bit of research a few months ago and bought VW. They are the largest investors of EV technology and they started earlier than companies like Toyota, as far as I'm aware.

A question for car companies in general, what is the profitability of electric cars compared to combustion engine cars? What's the macro trend for car companies? There's less innovation that they can put into a car because cars have suddenly become much simpler, way fewer moving parts, most will probably be buying their batteries in, electric motors are way simpler than combustion engines, so harder to differentiate.

In my opinion, we'll see more companies differentiating by having different passenger 'experiences' and interiors compared to having different driving specs.

136,EV," I actually agree with this. Toyota has been suspiciously quiet the past few years and you know they're working on something. I just cannot believe that they are blatantly lying about having a usable solid state battery. They have something up their sleeve. Naysayers will claim that they put all their eggs in the hydrogen basket, but they aren't dumb enough to do that. They correctly predicted the demand for hybrids far before anyone else, and have been producing vehicles with lithium batteries for decades now. I say if anything they are at it again, looking ten years out just like they did with the prius. Their solid state battery won't have insane energy density or anything. It will probably be in the ball park of the best lithium ion cells. But knowing toyota it will be stone cold reliable, operate at real world temperatures, no fire risk, very long cycle life and slow charging but no degradation. Toyota knows their customer. No toyota buyer would be interested in a lithium ion battery with a fire risk and that loses 10 percent capacity over time. Toyota isn't going away. The Japanese government would not allow it. The only way toyota is doomed is if you assume they are completely missing the EV transition, which if you take a step back and ask yourself ""does that sound realistic?"" Well, no it doesn't. They obviously aren't missing it. It just appears that way because of the timing of things. No doubt switching your entire operation over to a new technology is not easy. But we are talking about the company that wrote the book here. Manufacturing is what they do.

I agree Toyota is a great company with a solid foundation, but they seem firmly rooted in traditional automotive/industrial manufacturing. One could argue that this space could become commoditized over time. Being the worlds best manufacturer is nothing to scoff at, but how much more innovation could there be in this space? Other than automation, which is already priced in, it's not clear. Also, as a manufacturer they have huge liabilities with infrastructure, tariffs, unions, etc. Apple, by comparison, doesn't manufacture their own stuff. As an automotive developer, Toyota aren't that impressive. Their technology is very traditional and they seemed to have squandered the massive lead they had with the Prius by not pursuing plug-ins and electrics aggressively enough. They did the traditional auto maker thing of wanting to milk the thing that worked, not realizing PHEVs aren't the end state. Their foray into hydrogen is a fool's errand and a serious miscalculation on their part. The real reason automakers want to do hydrogen is that it's a product oil producers can make.

161,GM," GM, FCA, and Toyota all sided with the Trump administration on the fight for CA emissions laws. Some of the other auto makers were on the other side, no sure where Subaru landed. I love Toyota vehicles, but despite their early Prius/Hybrid lines they aren't that green of a company. Aggressive changes to standards works against their slow and steady engineering. They also use their high mpg small cars to offset their really poor mpg 4WD vehicles that tend to have older, under-stressed, overbuild engines that get poor mileage; Toyota doesn't need to eek out every MPG from their FWD like the big 3 do with their pickups.

Subaru is in a bit of a pinch since full-time AWD is their signature feature and that is really hard to pull good mpg numbers out of. Although, Subaru is doing a really good job of it for full-time AWD cars. With their tight coupling now I see Toyota potentially using Subaru as a test bed for new techs (EVs, next gen infotainment, performance collaborations) to avoid risking Toyota's reliability branding. Toyota is definitely wielding all the power in that relationship since Subaru is more of a parts supplier that started making cars than a proper car company.",xarune,1,/r/investing/comments/lhdjf1/a_rough_analysis_on_toyota_motors/gmzbj2d/,0.097,0.818,0.084,-0.2308

I mean it would be great if Toyota made solid state batteries work just as well in passenger vehicles, but it's just very unlikely that they'll make them better than lithium ion will be in a timely fashion while also reducing costs.

It's interesting you brought up ETH as if it doesn't have all these problems x 1000. Current cost of a single transaction on Ethereum is about $10 - $100 depending on the time of day, and only if you want a transaction to process with a few minutes.

BTC has nothing to worry about. There isn't a blockchain platform that doesn't compromise on one of three things: speed, cost, security. At scale you can have 1 of those 3, but not all 3. The faster / cheaper the platform, the more likely it is to be either insecure or more centralized (i.e. defeating the point). BTC is a juggernaut, because, despite being slow and expensive, it is one of the most secure computer networks in the world. And that makes it very valuable.

Big oil companies only refine the oil, after that the fuel will likely go though a dozen different midstream companies before it even gets sold to a station. Oil companies got out of the gas station game long ago. Too many expenses and too many to manage.

People with stable parking locations (driveway/garage) will do 90%+ of their charging at home, leaving every morning with a 'full tank'.

Putting in a Level 2 charger (<= 50 kW, adds 30-40 miles of range per hour) is pretty cheap, and you don't need the oversight or tanks that a gas pump does. They are often placed as 'destination chargers' - my local Chili's has a couple, and they're free - it gets extra customers coming in at a cost of about $2/hour. Similarly, I'll seek out hotels with chargers when I'm on a road trip.

Gas stations are smelly, nasty places. I'd much rather charge while I'm at the mall, in a restaurant or supermarket, or while I'm working in the office, etc.

The only people who need to stop specifically to charge are on long road trips, or who have no access to charging overnight at home - urban centers are the great underserved market here.

242,BP," Need some advice on this

I have experience in buying options mostly vertical and naked call options. Heard selling puts on stocks I think are somewhat undervalued is a great strategy.

BP on LSE is trading at 255 (pence). It hit an all-time low earlier this year at around 200. bad news revolving covid reopening and fall in oil demand has kept the stock down. I think everything under 300 is a huge overreaction because of a worse than expected quarter. 

I'm therefore looking at buying bullish options on this. I would think that selling at 200 pence strike price options is the way to go. at 200 exp.July 2021 the cost would be 650£.

243,EGOV," Still relatively new to investing. A short while ago I purchased shares in EGOV. There was a recent cash sale announcement and all shares are being bought @34 a share, a 14% increase over last close. A law firm encouraged shareholders to reach out about 34 not being fair to investors. I don't have many shares, and selling would net about $24 profit.


1. It still appears to be able to trade, at a few cents higher than 34. Wouldn't it make the most sense to sell now? Is there any chance the 34 would be revised?


2. Do I physically need to sell, will it be done automatically?


3. Are the lawyers saying reach out to us is you feel the offer was low a fairly common thing in these kinds of situations?",thanos_gme_snap,2,/r/investing/comments/lhhl70/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gmy2v7e/,0.029,0.813,0.157,0.9273

256,USA," 30 yars old. USA.

I have about 25k in cash. 5k emergency fund, 20k meant for a down payment on a house.

50k in my 401k, 7k in my Roth IRA. -25k net worth

The housing market is insane right now with houses going for 50-100k over listing and flying off the shelves instantly. So much competition....it seems not worth it.

Because of this, I've decided to hold off on buying in the next few years.

Now, I need to decide what to do with 15k. NOT going into individual stocks, so I am looking at ETFs in Fidelity.

My initial thoughts are - hit my limit on my 2020 Roth IRA while I still can, then invest in the following:

 QQQ
 $3,000
 VOO
 $3,000
 ARKQ / ARKX (march)
 $4,000
 MSOS / POTX
 $5,000

I am currently using eToro, which is fee free (obviously they are profiting on the spread) which works well for the small amounts I'm playing with, this seems to be the only fee free option I can find available in Australia? I know we're behind the rest of the world in many ways but feels like I must be missing something. 

Issue I have is that it seems to be very limited on what's available to trade, no ASX listed shares and many others not there (AMC, SNDL, VFF all unavailable) 

My portfolio is worth a whopping $900 as of now, I have $25k cash in the bank and I'd be ready to drop $10k in to get started properly (sticking with stock buys only for now with no leverage) and then will probably look to add approx $500 p/m whilst hopefully making gains along the way.

With that background, would anyone have recommendations as to any alternative platforms to take  a closer look at (that are beginner friendly!) and an idea of whether my fear of fees is rational at these kind of investment levels (imagining 20x picks at $500 each) or whether I would get better value with a broker that charges fees but doesn't hit you on the spread.

294,TSM," After some research and suggestions from other responses, I've narrowed down international ETFs to a few prime candidates for long-term investing, and would value any opinions on them.

AIA is one of Blackrock's iShares offerings, so a reliable Asian-focused ETF.  However, despite technically being Asia region, it's actually only four countries - China, Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.  It is fairly top-heavy in Tencent, TSM, and Samsung, but as those are solid performers, it's done well historically.

XSOE is from WisdomTree, with whom I am less familiar.  It focuses on non-state-owned holdings and expands beyond the Asian region for a total of nine countries worldwide, though the heaviest percentage is in China, Korea, Taiwan, and India.  They have not done quite as well as AIA in the past, but share the same top holdings plus adding Alibaba.  Their diversification is likely what has held them back due to having 510 holdings compared to AIA's 55.

Lastly, CXSE follows the same methodology as XSOE, but solely focused on China.  This means they do not hold TSM or Samsung, but are heavily invested in Tencent and Alibaba.  They have performed exceptionally well recently, but have experienced far greater volatility over time than either of the other choices and likely face the greatest risk of government regulation going forward.

I'd welcome any input.  Thanks for your help.",Daemi,1,/r/investing/comments/lhhl70/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gmyr0jn/,0.011,0.82,0.17,0.9894

Say I bought 100 stocks of AAPL at $100, and then 100 more at $150. If I'm not mistaken, this would move my average to $125.

If I sell all of them at $120, what would be the Realized Loss subject to Wash sale if I reenter in less than 30 days?

I'm not sure whether if it is the $3000 loss from buying at $150 and selling at $120, or it actually considers your average price for Realized Gains/Loss calculations.

305,SSPK," Personally, my approach with something like this (a theme) is:

1.  Find the name where I have the most confidence (like management, like the business, etc) in the company as a long-term play on the theme (whether it be pot or something else.) If I think this is a compelling long-term theme, what stock would I be okay with if I couldn't sell it for a few years? Ultimately, if I think this is a long-term theme, I want what I will be most comfortable/confident in.

2. Buy it and try to be in relatively early.  Always be on the lookout for compelling themes/trends.

3. Long period of doing nothing. Don't chase/have FOMO (and if you buy reasonably early, you won't have FOMO/be compelled to chase hot names) Hype can cause sectors to get waaaay ahead of themselves (see also: ...the last time that weed got way ahead of itself a couple of years ago and then the sector cratered.) Do I think there's going to be a repeat of what happened to weed a couple of years ago? No, but I think eventually there's going to be a correction and probably eventually a shakeout that gets rid of some of the weakest/worst players.

I owned GTBIF for a while and did extremely well with that. I saw the Weedmaps SPAC (SSPK) announce that deal late last year and bought that the moment I saw the news because I thought it's one of the few highly appealing broad plays on weed - I'm not betting on a specific MSO or grower, plus significant audience (10M+ MAU) and well-known brand. Basically sort of a weed Yelp/Grubhub. ""Weedhub""

SSPK has more than doubled since. 

There will be a more opportune time to add if I want to add to SSPK or look at other weed names (the only other things I'd look at if anything would be the MSOS ETF or a couple of the individual names in that.)

Weed will be a theme. What part of that business is more compelling long-term I think is a good question and how many of these companies are built to last (I'll guess a number of them are not.)

So I have no idea what these names will do in the short-term. All I can say more broadly is, if you think weed is a long-term theme, what do you think is the very best play on that that you'd feel comfortable with owning long-term? Buy it on significant dips (not when everyone is falling all over themselves to pile in and indiscriminately buying anything related) and hold. If it dips more, add more. Don't overdo it in terms of allocation - too many people get overly excited about something when everyone is going crazy for it and pile most/all of their portfolio into it at the wrong time.",dvdmovie1,2,/r/investing/comments/lhhl70/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gmxi929/,0.036,0.852,0.112,0.9855

Growth is used because of the idea that stocks are priced on future returns. Fundamentally, a stock is worth the sum of its discounted future cash flows.

sometimes this is good advice sometimes not.

I do however think it is important that you have at least a basic understanding of what the business does and how it makes money. Take TSMC you don't need to understand how they make semi-conductors , or even understand the MFG or design process; but you just need to know their business model; making semi-conductors is hard and expensive you need to build massively expensive fabs; meaning unless you are churning out hundreds of millions of these building a fab on your own will be cost prohibitive so you outsource to TSMC if you only need 5 million built per year.",SirGlass,1,/r/investing/comments/lhhl70/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gmxts8p/,0.009,0.9,0.091,0.899

360,IMO," IMO, it's this market...

""1) Value has become a dirty word. Traditional fund managers used to identify a cheap stock and buy it in the hope that it would gain in value. **Nowadays cheapness is a turn off rather than a turn on. Expensive stocks get more expensive as they attract more flows, and cheap stocks are shunned as losers rather than diamonds waiting to be discovered.** One way of thinking about this is that prices used to be self-limiting. Stocks would rise to a point where valuations (earnings multiples or price-to-book) would become unattractive, which would cause the stock to go down and give valuations a chance to normalize. **Nowadays, the amount of money chasing inflows means that prices can go much higher than traditional security analysis might suggest. In a world of sluggish growth and asset price inflation, chasing inflows has arguably become the best bet to generate outperformance**.

2) Flows before Pros. I've written about this a lot this year. But the simple premise here is that in an environment where **flows matter more than fundamentals**, the guy trading stocks in his basement might be better equipped to judge where money is going next. He might have **a better sense of the strength of a stock's particular ""story,"" for instance, than a portfolio manager wedded to valuation models**. In a more-than-a-little-ironic turn of events, finance professionals are now chasing retail flows.""

If you watch the portfolios of what people are posting on here, they increasingly all feel the same - lot of the same names, a lot of the same hot themes/etfs. Seeing what seems like everyone posting the same things does not IMO make them compelling, it makes them somewhat concerning as it becomes clear that everyone is piling into increasingly crowded trades/is on the same side of the boat.

Edit: I mean, we live in a time where Ark buying $6M of something was followed by investors buying to the degree that added a record 3.3B to the company's market cap. https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-11/cathie-wood-copycats-trigger-3-billion-surge-in-ping-an-health. Nothing against Ark or aggressive growth, but it's an example of the flywheel spinning - tons of flows into Ark, she buys something and sets off tons of buying, which lead to continued outperformance which leads to more buying. It's all about flows (as discussed above) and tons of money is flowing into Ark and anything similarly growthy.

361,IMO," You can absolutely outperform the market short term if you can predict retail flows, of course doing so is difficult.

If your investment strategy depends on fair valuations and fundamentals, it can take years or even decades for your analysis to actually result in a solid return if the market fails to recognize the value of the stock, especially if it doesn't pay a dividend. Even if a company is growing earnings and you think the trend will continue, if the market is scared the company will fail soon due to a risk you think is not an issue, the market might continue to price it less than you paid for it, leaving you with little liquidity. If you don't want a loss, you have to commit to the investment until either the company returns capital to shareholders that exceeds the decline in price you've experienced, or the market finally acknowledges the value you anticipated and prices it higher.

IMO the best strategy right now is a combination of the two. First start by utilizing fundamentals to identify companies that are undervalued. Then by predicting retail flows, utilize this to buy in at favorable prices and buy/sell based on volatility, adjusting size of position based on the price. So if it's severely undervalued, increase weight in portfolio, and if overvalued, decrease weight, and also take advantage of retail trends.

For example, I'm doing this with LUMN. It's a company that I believe is undervalued based on the cash flow it generates and dividends it pays, so I'm comfortable holding it. I bought initially around $9 on average when investors were scared due to past dividend cuts, rising interest rates, pandemic, etc. When the price grew suddenly to $15 a couple weeks ago, I sold, knowing it had to be something fishy and temporary. I then bought back in a smaller position at $12.

I almost sold yesterday before earnings on the prediction that people were buying in prior to earnings with hope to sell after(I anticipated the price would drop post earnings), but ended up not selling because I was expecting it to rise higher and it dropped in the last hour of trading, and I had FOMO that I would have to buy in at a higher price. So I missed an opportunity to sell and buy in cheaper due to FOMO.",skilliard7,3,/r/investing/comments/lhekgj/are_we_in_times_of_placeholders_companies/gmysk6i/,0.053,0.871,0.076,0.7133

I do agree ARKK is Risky and Pricey , and that the market is in for a correction IMO. So I am treading carefully - already burnt my fingers once trapped in a stupid structured plan. 

Gold is a good suggestion - I dont know much about commodities but will spend some time learning about investing in that Tonight. 

An no, unfortunately being a long term expat, I don't have options for a 529 - I just want to grow my wealth over the long term, so that I don't worry about retirement like my parents did. Hopefully my kids turn out to be smart and secure Scholarships and I buy a nice house on a beach somewhere cheap :D",ShoofiMaafi,1,/r/investing/comments/lhgki8/critique_my_portfolio_please/gmxnixh/,0.07,0.649,0.282,0.9849

446,USA," It sounds to me like you are saying you have an expense of $X in 12 mo and have a portfolio of 2X.  That is you need a portfolio that absolutely won't have a drawdown more than 50% but can comfortably take risk beyond that.  

I think you can take on more risk but something like the Larry Portfolio is a minimum:

* 70% short  high quality bonds (VCSH)
* 15% USA small cap value (FNDA)
* 15% EM value (FNDE)

I think you can boost the risk to something more like

* 50% short term high quality bonds
* 15% USA small cap value (FNDA)
* 15% EM value (FNDE)

450,FCF," Oh ok yeah, I watched the first few minutes (up until the net income ratio you were talking about). 

This is actually a decent video from what I can tell so far. 

He's basically saying that since the free cash flow of apple relates well to income, he's just going to project out income instead and then convert it to FCF by using that 107% income to FCF ratio. It's not exactly the ""right"" way to do it, but it probably works fine for Apple and other mature companies as net income and FCF probably have a very consistent relationship. You won't necessarily see that for all companies across the board. 

There's also different ways to perform dcf. Ricke318 mentioned levered free cash flow (also known as free cash flow to equity - fcfe). The way I usually do it is by using unlevered free cash flow (or free cash flow to firm - fcff). Both should get you to a very similar answer, but just pointing out that there's more than one way to skin the dcf cat. 

I'd recommend continuing to watch the video you posted - it seems pretty good. And then find other sources and try to fill in what you don't understand from those. Once you read (and watch) enough, things will start to click.

452,TSLA," This is the correct answer. In other words, he still owns over $500,000,000 worth of TSLA and the $25M reflects a mere 5% change in his TSLA holdings.

453,AAPL," To name one example out of the countless, I had occasional doubts like you similar to this reasoning  when I kept  averaging down on AAPL when it fell some 40% from ~$700/shr to some ~$400 back in 2012 to 2013. I had a ton of red for the longest time on some of those positions. 7 years later, all those buys have made AAPL my largest holding.

454,IMO," The point of “averaging down” is all about the easiest road to a break even/profit across the total position held. If its highly unlikely that stock X returns to $300 share price anytime soon....but its totally possible that it does get back to $175....then the no brainer move would be to average down, so if/when it does get back to $175, you’ve recouped your loss from the $300 trade, and the share price never had to get back to that level. 

The statistical probability of breaking even/making profit on initially bad trades where you bought the top, increases significantly by averaging down IMO. I do it for sure.",GrassOrAss954,1,/r/investing/comments/lh57q2/discussion_on_averaging_down_being_a_myth/gmvb8m8/,0.068,0.812,0.12,0.6369
