0,FL," It's been 20 years that states have been poaching CA based corporations on the promise of low/no taxes. And to add insult to CA's injury, this is done by CA paying the bill. The per capita Federal payment to FL is $2,187, the per capita Federal payment to CA is $12. So FL doesn't ask for money because it gets a TON of federal money, and CA keeps paying FL's bills.

&#x200B;

So well done, FL - the play is to suck off the Federal tit and then brag that you don't have income tax or corporate tax. But make sure you claim fiscal responsibility as long as the Federal dollars keep rolling in. Just like the founders wanted.

5,VERY," There's more to it. A few of my friends that are long term Disney employees are most likely getting moved if they can't find other jobs by November. 

The entire Disney staff here is VERY left leaning and absolutely hates the idea of being moved to Florida.  They employ tons of LGBT people as well.  Morale is really low, a lot of talent is trying to jump ship. They'll need to import other talent to the middle of Florida which isn't easy. 

Of course as a whole, Disney has their cult and anything they do makes money which is why I have their stock. 

This move, I'm witnessing first hand and it's a really shitty thing to do.

It's also a very beautiful country and fascinating. Every 50 kilometers you drive the country is completely different and has completely different weather system.

Only draw backs is if you're not living near one of the major cities. It can be a long drive to buy something specific that you want. You'll miss how Amazon works when living in the US, but I still go back to the US and still have one foot there.

Also crime, it's much safer than other neighboring countries but it's still a 3rd world country. You just have to pay attention to where you are at night but there are worse neighborhoods in parts of the US. Some places are extremely safe, but there are bad spots you want to avoid.

Use play money to invest in individual stocks. The majority of professionals who pick individual stocks, and spend all day researching, still lose vs the index. Why would you do any better with less expertise and a full time job that isn’t researching equities?

52,IMO," In my opinion right now (Could change), Apple is a stock I plan on never selling (and im in my low 20's)

Price of apple falls one day, week, month= Add more to my portfolio.

I currently have a couple other stocks like that in my portfolio.

Reasoning; After investing in apple, I now look around when im out in public and notice around 75% of people are carrying an iPhone or AirPods or apple watch etc.

I am one of those people, I own a Mac, iPhone, AirPods and considering getting a Apple Watch. I am basically locked into the apple cloud and it will take a lot to reconsider changing my phone. When apple gets into EV (which they will) they will have tons of growth. APPL has enough cash to do anything and keep up with the latest technology.

With that being said, apple is not the only stock I own but will continue to add to my position.

$SPY is a great ETF that I will also slowly add to my position over time. 

Like you said you make around 70K a year, so IMO id keep ur apple and continue to add S&P ETF when you can.

hopefully that helps!

Also, be aware that selling short dated options will reset the holding period of your underlying.

99,CVS," Amazon is taking on water 1,000 different ways bc they’re trying to do a million different things and have countless targets on their back. Doordash is purely focused on delivering instant gratification re physical products. I am extremely bullish on people wanting more and more instant gratification of physical products and think DD is best positioned to deliver. 

I own restaurants, own door dash stock, and order delivery 10-15x per week on average.

As a restaurant owner, they are far superior to all other competition. They currently partner with Square on some back end - what’s stopping them from taking over payment processing for their restaurant customers? And I’m scared shitless I’m gonna lose my shirt once DD starts opening it’s own restaurants and ghost kitchens. Doing your own delivery only works in really dense places like NYC or if you’re like dominos and have 10 locations spread out over a bigger market. 90% of restaurants are gonna be in trouble if DASH ever goes into direct competition against them bc customers will continue to demand delivery and most restaurants just can’t deliver it themselves.

Look at gopuff. Yeah dash is working with Albertsons and  7-11 now but just like restaurants - soon all the convenience items and grocery items they’re delivering will be their own in-house brands like Kirklands at Costco or Trader Joe’s. People want fewer good choices not plentiful shitty choices. Why eBay sucks, why Amazon retail is going to hell and why Trader Joe’s, Costco, Target thrive. Dash is well established to deliver on all of this, no pun intended. 

 As a consumer, Door dash delivers my prescriptions from CVS, my Apple products from Apple, my cookies from crumbl. And 80% of my on-demand food (Ruth’s Chris and the local burrito place are on uber eats only smh) Pretty much anything except Target orders from shipt and Instacart orders from costco. 

I think when more people have more disposable income, their spending will look more like mine. I think disposable income will continue to increase for more and more people - look at who millennials and gen Z elect. Spending 30 minutes round trip picking up your $10 burrito or buying all your groceries and cooking all your meals to save $30/day is for people who don’t value their time. You should be working on your side hustle or startup, wasting time saving money cooking and picking up your own takeout is just making it harder for your business to be successful and you become the next billionaire! Focus on your assets not wasting time doing menial tasks and manual labor to save pennies. 

Also more and more people getting rid of their cars or shifting to one car households. Save money on that but require more delivery. Just customers transferring that spending from geico and Ford to doordash. 

While I’m talking crazy, the next generation isn’t gonna even have a full kitchen in their home, let alone cook for themselves.

I plan to hold for 20-30 years and expect it’s a $10 billion company along the way but expect it’s a multi trillion $ behemoth when all is said and done.

They currently partner with Square on some back end - what’s stopping them from taking over payment processing for their restaurant customers? And I’m scared shitless I’m gonna lose my shirt once DD starts opening it’s own restaurants and ghost kitchens. Doing your own delivery only works in really dense places like NYC or if you’re like dominos and have 10 locations spread out over a bigger market. 90% of restaurants are gonna be in trouble if DASH ever goes into direct competition against them bc customers will continue to demand delivery and most restaurants just can’t deliver it themselves.

Look at gopuff. Yeah dash is working with Albertsons and  7-11 now but just like restaurants - soon all the convenience items and grocery items they’re delivering will be their own in-house brands like Kirklands at Costco or Trader Joe’s. People want fewer good choices not plentiful shitty choices. Why eBay sucks, why Amazon retail is going to hell and why Trader Joe’s, Costco, Target thrive. Dash is well established to deliver on all of this, no pun intended. 

 As a consumer, Door dash delivers my prescriptions from CVS, my Apple products from Apple, my cookies from crumbl. And 80% of my on-demand food (Ruth’s Chris and the local burrito place are on uber eats only smh) Pretty much anything except Target orders from shipt and Instacart orders from costco. 

I think when more people have more disposable income, their spending will look more like mine. I think disposable income will continue to increase for more and more people - look at who millennials and gen Z elect. Spending 30 minutes round trip picking up your $10 burrito or buying all your groceries and cooking all your meals to save $30/day is for people who don’t value their time. You should be working on your side hustle or startup, wasting time saving money cooking and picking up your own takeout is just making it harder for your business to be successful and you become the next billionaire! Focus on your assets not wasting time doing menial tasks and manual labor to save pennies. 

Also more and more people getting rid of their cars or shifting to one car households. Save money on that but require more delivery. Just customers transferring that spending from geico and Ford to doordash. 

While I’m talking crazy, the next generation isn’t gonna even have a full kitchen in their home, let alone cook for themselves.

I plan to hold for 20-30 years and expect it’s a $10 billion company along the way but expect it’s a multi trillion $ behemoth when all is said and done. 

I’m also extremely bullish on TGT (with Shipt) for many of the same reasons.

Stop losses just in case, and Ive made enough money to be happy without going to a casino. Ofc, not investing blindly, if it goes wrong but there is tons of potential, then I turn the short term play into a long one. Thats why u learn about the company, to see if there is actually a legit reason to do so

136,AMD," I agree with ""Invest in what you know""...but you can learn about things you don't currently know so the sky is the limit. Research and forward thinking is key.

I'm a big gamer so I researched for processors and chips for months. Looking at current frame rate issues and upcoming next gen consoles. Developer's games falling flat because the technology wasn't there. AMD seemed the way to go in 2018 and that really paid off.

I try to see where we're going as a society and get in early. TAAT is one I like just because nicotine is on it's way out and cessation is a legitimate addiction that TAAT can deliver without nicotine and tobacco.

I also like AVCR. Mostly because the Weston Family has a vision to democratize the pharmacy industrt giving pharmacists the tools to conduct blood testing, monitor diabetes and even provide covid tests. Shoppers Drug Mart just had a successful pilot of HealthTab. Loblaws own Shoppers, the Weston Family aka Galen Weston of President's Choice owns Lowblaws. Looking at PC's existing healthcare structure it appears part and parcel to a bigger ecosystem that AVCR's HealthTab is becoming a part of. 

Don't take any of my advice but I'd look around and see what interests you then research everything you can.",Jon_Forge,1,/r/stocks/comments/p3ftlf/how_do_you_guys_find_good_companies_to_invest_in/h8tqlrm/,0.006,0.93,0.064,0.8422
137,DD," I watch what the Government is doing. I like tech, and green energy stocks. No pharmacy for me. (My preference.)Then DD starts. I look at business, money, possible contracts, any past or present lawsuits. I read  stock sites but do my own DD. I’m a small guy and look for stocks under $1.00. What I’m doing seems to work for me. I’m up +1000% on one stock, and +17% on another. My last purchase of stocks was at .48 cents, and it’s around $4. Now. I just like screwing around with stocks, and better than lottery tickets.   “This is not financial recommendations and I’m not a financial advisor.”😂",ruwo1171,1,/r/stocks/comments/p3ftlf/how_do_you_guys_find_good_companies_to_invest_in/h8tqp98/,0.048,0.857,0.095,0.7311
138,AMC," I have a few strategies. But first, I noticed lots of people are saying watch the stock for a week or some time period. Don’t. When you find a stock you like and have confidence in long term growth, just buy. If you’re going to hold for a few years, a week of watching does nothing and is equivalent to day trading. Maybe it’ll drop, but maybe it’ll go up. Dice roll. To combat this and mitigate risk, buy over time. If you want 50 shares, buy 10 shares per day or per week. The longer between buys, the more risk you mitigate (potential loss of some upside to potentially lower your avg cost basis). 

For stock selection, my primary strategy is buying strong, stable companies. Something like Apple isn’t going away any time soon. Sure, you won’t see 1000% return in a year, but very low chance to lose money. 

Next, when there’s a product fad, I invest in major suppliers of that company. E.g. when GoPro was the rage, I bought Ambarella, which supplied chips to GoPro. That far outperformed GoPro, and for longer the. The fad lasted since they were diversified. 

Next, be opportunistic. When a severely negative event happens, like COVID, invest in the hardest hit sectors. Travel was a good example - you know people will eventually travel again. I actually bought AMC for a similar reason - I knew movie theaters would eventually come back and seemed like a bargain. Granted, the meme stock stuff really threw off the proof of concept there, but theory holds.",LeaningTowerOfPizza,1,/r/stocks/comments/p3ftlf/how_do_you_guys_find_good_companies_to_invest_in/h8ttal1/,0.126,0.697,0.177,0.9291

274,DD," Ignoring the ethics and looking at it as a business opportunity: this industry is under bought because people think it is dying. That view is wrong in my opinion because most of these companies increase their revenue every year. They are still totally reliant on combustible tobacco, but their share of revenue from other segments is constantly increasing. Weed and vaping and heated tobacco are massive opportunities to continue growing. 

The other, even better reason that these stocks are underbought is because many, many pension funds and mutuals don’t buy them because of the ethical issues. This makes the stocks cheaper (simple supply and demand). Given that they’re dividend machines, this means more profit for those of us willing to invest in them. 

Over a long enough time horizon (half a lifetime), the ethical issues might lessen and the dead industry fear might disappear, so I think in addition to earnings growth and earnings expansion, these stocks might benefit from multiple expansion. 

I own shares in Altria, Philip Morris and British American Tobacco. The first two because they seem to have a head start on heated tobacco, the last because of the insane yield. I may buy some Imperial as well, I need to do my DD first. 

It’s noteworthy that the analyst consensus on these companies is for continued revenue growth. People have been forecasting the demise of big tobacco for decades. So far everyone who has done so has been wrong. 

I won’t invest in Swedish Match because the thought of putting tobacco against my gum makes me feel nauseous. Don’t know why, it just is a horrid concept to me.",hmu5nt,5,/r/stocks/comments/p391m3/tobacco_stocks_unpopular_but_is_there_money_to_be/h8sa1nz/,0.092,0.761,0.147,0.9386

It’s a double-edged sword.

Whatever anyone's opinion on Uber is as a brand, their brand name is synonymous with ridesharing, and is practically so with food delivery. As EUI ends, more gig workers will be re-entering the job market looking for work. Another often overlooked part of Uber's revenue are business travelers, which have not come close to being restored to 2019 levels.

I believe alphabet is technically a parent not a holding.  But the distinction is narrow and doesn’t really matter.  The legal structure of a big group like alphabet doesn’t matter to investors (unless I’m limited weird situations like BABA or Porsche owning VW) in most situations. Investors are interested in the ‘enterprise’ as a whole. 

The antitrust stuff has nothing to do with the legal structure.

It’s not a holding company, it’s a parent company.
The thing is when a company buys another, it depends on the size and scale and the impact on the consumer. There are mergers that have to go though regulatory approval so that there is not impact on the consumer. The reason you here about anti trust stuff as you put it, is because some companies to become too large and their scale allows them to potentially take advantage of the consumer. There is definitely much more to it than that.

346,IRS," First, 70-100 = $30 of realized gains if I am reading that right.  Thats what is used for tax purposes.  Your unrealized gain themselves don't matter.

However, if that unrealized is based on a position you took within 30 days of the realized loss, you have a wash sale, and the unrealized is not allowed until you close out the position taken within 30 days.

Next issue is reporting.   Each broker will issue their own 1099 with realized gains and wash sales based purely on what is held with them.  It does nothing with what's at other brokers.  However, the IRS wants you to calculate wash sales across brokers.  So taking a loss in one account and putting on the same position in another account generates a wash sale according to the IRS, but would not show up on your broker 1099s.
