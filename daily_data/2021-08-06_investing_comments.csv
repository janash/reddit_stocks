12,SCHW," It really depends if the overreaction is justified or not and also the track record of the company. If you follow some stocks, its kind of a trend that after every overreaction (from earnings), there will be a correction in the following weeks or months until the next earning and then it might repeat itself. Sometimes, there is no correction and will trade sideways until next earnings because investors is looking to see if the company will recover or not. This really depend on the sentiment and perception on the company.

Its hard to know when the drop is going to stop. I normally wait a day or two before going in a certain stock. Because I rather buy calls than hold a stock for too long. If a stock drops by too much, I rather buy a call 1 month from expiration and it has worked well so far.

Like Today, there is a rally from all the banks. Banks have been down since July (after Jpow speech). I expected a rally but I sold some calls yesterday (SCHW) at 20% profit and the calls I sold today (JPM), I made a good 60% in the morning. While, I could have hold it a bit for the afternoon. If I held the calls for SCHW till today, I would have made easily more than 150%.

64,MKC," One that I never see talked about is MKC (McCormick Spices). I think spicy foods, and spices in general will continue to become more common especially in the US as we continue to become a more globalized world. More cultures mixing together and that’s what happens, so I don’t see this trend slowing down or stopping any time soon. And I think that with increasing wealth inequality and food shortages caused by things like climate change, just-in-time supply chains, obviously pandemics, etc. we’re going to start seeing an overall shift to more people cooking (and even growing, even if on a small scale) their own food and using spices rather than going to a fast food place or buying a packaged item for every meal (Incidentally, I’m also long $MCD, just too big to fail).",thebiffdog,6,/r/investing/comments/oytnbj/what_are_some_of_your_less_popular_stocks_that/h7v9dkx/,0.024,0.92,0.056,0.6369

I am surprised this one isn't more popular considering it's a trendy brand among millennials and Gen Z. It's had a massive run (like most other things) after the pandemic crash last March. It's a bit rich in valuation but it's one of the few companies that IPO'd thats actually profitable and not losing money. Revenue keeps growing and it's running circles around the competition because of the vast amounts of data it has access too.

>if someone comes along and does Apple things better than Apple, that IP becomes worthless very quickly, very little salvage value.

Correct. The problem with intellectual property is that its value could vary wildly depending on whose hands its in...  How would I know?  I wrote my senior thesis on internet distribution of music.

A few years later, Apple acquired Soundjam MP from Casady & Greene, licensed one-click purchasing from Amazon, and turned it into iTunes Music Store...

The opposite is also true... Remember when Murdoch paid $580 million for MySpace?

You'll also notice that the tech companies that supposedly have ""huge"" IP value don't actually make that claim in their financial statements.  They mostly don't have glaringly huge intangible assets... Out of $323 billion in total assets, AAPL, who patents hundreds of things they never even bring to market, has not listed a dime of intangible assets on their balance sheet since 2017.  Facebook's gross intangibles are $5 billion out of $159 billion in assets... insignificant.  Amazon's gross intangibles are $6.4 billion out of $321 billion in assets.  It's almost as if the people who dismiss P/B don't even passingly glance at balance sheets, let alone understand what's in them.

Everything else they will rattle off in response to your rather straightforward question that has a *measurable* impact on the byproduct we're interested in, operating cash flow, is reflected somewhere in the financial statements and ticks-and-ties between the engine (balance sheet) and its work output (cash flow).

If price is increasing rapidly in relation to tangible book value, then it is most likely increasing in relation to the discounted cash flow of the company as well... it's the ***rate of change*** in this metric that's important here, and that seems to be what the dismissive responses are missing (besides not having thoroughly read the financials at all).",th3cr1t1c,1,/r/investing/comments/oz9lis/sp_500_pricetobook_ratio_approaching_pre2000/h7z8x3x/,0.065,0.845,0.091,0.7201

>Can they take over real-estate business in the long-term with direct home sales?

Sure looks like it. They need iBuying to fill their funnel, selling homes is easy. Look at their iBuying performance over the past two quarters

&#x200B;

>Does any other company have a sophisticated algo designed to buy homes like Z does?

AI/ML model accuracy is entirely dependent on duration they've been running and comprehensiveness/longevity of the datasets you can feed it. Not sure anyone can catch them at this point without a serious influx of capital to purchase past data-sets and a wickedly smart group of data-scientists. Look how accurate the Zestimate already is. The Zestimate is fueling their iBuyer program, which has grown substantially and was incredibly profitable the last two quarters.

I do think that there will probably be some attempt to go back into these ""re-opening"" plays before people feel the worst of the current variant has passed, but people also felt similarly not that long ago. Lets say things get better over the coming weeks, that gets us to September and then it's Fall. Sticking with long-term growth themes just continues to feel easier than trying to figure out whether the next few months are going to be okay enough to allow things like travel plays to take off or whether another wave will cause these names to sit on the runway.

256,IRS," Ok, so we can see your income is going to go up in the next 4/5 years, and you’ll likely do most of your retirement planning around a percentage of that income (standard advice is to save for 70% of your income, though I personally prefer to plan around expenses as income is kind of useless for people with high savings rates).  Since you’re early on and don’t really know what your expenses will be, targeting 70k (roughly 70% of your expected peak) makes sense for now. If the income you make now is significantly less than 70k, then a Roth is likely your best bet (again with some caveats here and there with manipulating your agi as needed for the advanced). 

Another advantage to the roth is that you can withdraw contributions, but not gains, at anytime without a penalty. Gains have to wait until 59.5. Traditional, it’s all locked away until then. That means if you max your account this year and have an unplanned major expense your senior year, you can always go back and pull some out to dig yourself out. You don’t want to put yourself in a spot where you have to quit school to save money and lose out on a great career. Roth is very handy for people with skint emergency funds in that way. Note though that you can get audited and will have to prove it was a contribution, so you need to document your contributions on your taxes and save them forever along with your brokerage papers. The IRS only keeps 10 years of paperwork,  but can demand any timeline from you.

I'd like to ask you for some advice. In January I bought a stock (LLKKF) and the app I bought in on (Trading212) shortly after restricted the stock.

There is an url below: https://helpcentre.trading212.com/hc/en-us/articles/360017986898-Temporarily-buying-suspension-on-illiquid-penny-stocks

After contacting with Trading212 employee they sent me over to InteractiveBrokers since its their intermediary.

IBKR told me that they cant trade it, since its microcap US stock. (https://ibkr.info/article/2892)

However there is a stock that is also on that microcap list (AMLM) and it can be traded in Trading212. Both of those have exact same categories (OTC, US, PINK).

When I pointed that out they didn't even answer me. The reponse was so vogue like ""LLKKF can't be traded"".

What can I do in this situation? There are many people that bought at the start of the year and it has been suspended since February. No employee can give me reasons or the requirements for the stock to be unrestricted. I need some help.
