If you think about it MMT is the only way governments are going to be able to survive in a world with increasingly complex problems and not enough access to capital to solve them. If they can print money and not worry about the debt then maybe we can overcome all the obstacles we face. 

So I believe that they will continue to print, inflation will temper the debt and anyone who isn't in good debt now will lose out over the next decade or so, possibly even all together or at least until everything collapses.

25,DD," Well, like I said, I can’t say they’re not a scam.  I said it’s a lottery ticket, and it’s worth doing your own DD.

But lack of a report or faces on a video does not make this a scam inherently.  There’s always a chance that expectations are higher than reality.  But you’re reading the negative into the lack of the report, and I’m reading it as they don’t really care if you feel that way or not.  They know what they have.  They’ll let the results speak for themselves.

Also remember, they’ve said they’re fronting the initial 10M to get started.  That is preventing dilution for the time being.  They plan to use the materials found to help fund future projects.  So, if that’s accurate, they wouldn’t care about the price of the stock in the short term.  And what benefit do they get from lying?

The original question was which mining stock am I most bullish on, and this is it.  If the numbers are accurate, then the price potential is astronomical.

77,AL," Check out $JADA ! Expecting a Quarterly Report to drop in the next 2 weeks. This is the expected logical next step for the new CEO, Wayne Sellers. Loading shares now under .10! This will make a major move once the report drops. Here is the Reverse Merger/Change of Control PR from 6/21/21:  
  
https://backend.otcmarkets.com/otcapi/company/financial-report/288558/content  
  
$JADA shell was bought in June from Joseph Arcaro's sister, Marianne Uveges, and control was updated in the PR above to the new CEO, Wayne Sellers; a Food/Supplement/Restaurant entrepreneur out of Birmingham, AL. He has a ton of $$ to inject into this company. He has told me he has close ties to Proton Power https://www.protonpower.com/ and Dr. Sam Weaver, who was a huge innovator at Oak Ridge National Energy Innovation Laboratory!

80,GE," $PSUD has been going off. Price increase of 38% yesterday alone. At the beginning of the year you were  looking at around 6¢/share, as of now before market open it is 74¢/share. 

This is a company that shows great potential. A possible deal with SpaceX and GE to directly supply helium while also being in talks with a major domestic car company to directly supply lithium. Just speculation, but, I feel like If they are already in talks to sell helium to SpaceX it might be obvious who would want to buy PSUDs helium as well. 

I think this stock is a gold mine and still just in the early stages. Hundreds of thousands of acres of mining land holding impressive amounts of helium/natural gas/oil/lithium/zeolite clay. They are estimating billions in revenue on the low end for just the helium, everything else will just be icing on the cake.",WarheadsOnForeheads0,-1,/r/pennystocks/comments/oxjx5x/the_loungedaily_plays_august_04_2021/h7nwvgc/,0.027,0.87,0.103,0.8968
