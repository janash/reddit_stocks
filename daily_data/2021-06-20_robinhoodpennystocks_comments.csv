5,ATOS," It might go up in the short term and i hope their meds work out. But thats just not how the stock market works. As the prices goes up, and long periods of no news occur, there will be sell offs and profit takers. With no actual income ATOS is at risk for dillution, especially when their drugs get passed the fda. 200m cash on hand is not enough to go into full production. There will absolutely be a huge dip at some point, regardless of the short term. You might like ATOS and you probably got in at 2 or 3. These posts one reddit should help the price, but a 10-20% payout on a already propped up price is not worth my time.",SuckinEggYolk,3,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/o40prt/atos_atos_atos_atos_atos_atos_inclusion_in_the/h2gc4ah/,0.073,0.783,0.144,0.9005
