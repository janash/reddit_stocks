10,MD," Welcome to life. 


There certainly are people that are smarter too though. You probably know one or two people in your life or have at least met them. Those people are just on the ball. 


One time I played this party game. Sort of like murder mystery. Where you had certain attributes and you had to figure out based on everyone else and their true / false, who the murderer was. Something like that. Sort of like Clue but all verbal. 


Early on this guy solves it. No guessing. We were all pretty surprised. He just explained it out. “Becky said no green 4 rounds ago and josh said yes to Fred’s question in the first round so by him not asking about Lauren, rob is the murderer.” Nobody had a clue how he derived that. 


I’m not saying he is a super genius. He’s just got a great working memory demonstrated here. 


He is also an MD and super charismatic person. Not overly in an annoying way. Very neutral casual way. 


Another guy I knew in college didn’t have to study. He just had to read or experience it once and then he knew it. Crazy. 


And yet another guy had crazy visual memory. Smart guy in general. Always asked really insightful questions or ideas or solutions. Always seemed one step ahead. 


One time he was recalling some page or something and couldn’t remember one part and described where it was on the page. Super interesting. 


Another person I know is a serial entrepreneur. Company’s galore. More recently from when I’ve known him, he had one multi national physical product store reach the hundreds of millions in sales. For whatever reason he stepped back and started another one. Really quite similar but not competitive against his earlier one. It’s now doing nearly as well. 


So people that are just higher caliber definitely exist. 


On the other hand. 98% of the bankers, lawyers, and accountants I’ve worked with are pretty dumb. Majority just do whatever the internal resources say. No critical thinking. Nothing.

26,AAPL," I just wish someone would explain this stuff. Like VIAC stock was around $35-$52 range in 2019. Then it goes to $102 in 2021. Their net income was like 37% higher in 2019 than the last 12 month in 2021. So, you have to assume VIAC is not only going to make up the lost profits, but also drive another 37% more. Sure they are going the route of streaming services, but their total revenue is actually down slightly from 2019. Even if you had a bullish case for the company, which is fine, why are people so interested in this company anyway to bid it up so fast?

And even if you take a company like AAPL, their net income is only up like 7.4% from 2018 levels. Apple was a $40-$58 stock in 2018. Now it went to $145 this year. So how is the stock worth 2.5 to 3.6X as much when Revenue is up 10.7% since 2018? I don't even see the covid case. So, everything has changed and everyone now needs an AAPL device! Why is Revenue up so little then to support some mass sales about to take place? If anything, everyone probably already bought what they need for the next few years and sales were pulled forward and there will be a drop off.

39,ANY," hedge funds have consistently trailed the indexes in a long term basis - aside from a few exceptions. It’s such a fraud - they trail the index and meanwhile they charge 2% of funds and 20% of gains. What a fraud! And a lot of them invest in index funds - while charging 2%. How ridiculous is that?

That’s not just my opinion - this is Warren Buffet and Charlie Munger’s opinion as well. Remember the bet Warren made with a hedge funds - pick any - ANY - hedge fund and see if they can outperform the market over 10 years. Guess who won that bet?

43,XEC," Note that this portfolio is designed for Canadians.  XIC in particular is Canadian stocks, so Americans might want to allocate that to the US (and probably a bit to international, since there's already a lot of US in the portfolio), and people from other countries may want to allocate the 30% to their home country/region.

The other three funds are also in Canadian currency.  The US equivalents are VUN->VTI, XEF->EFA, XEC->EEM.

Retail investors can buy Avantis funds now.  The portfolio is not factor-tilted at all without them.  It allocates 10% to AVUV (from VUN) and 6% to AVDV (from XEF).  So:

* 30% XIC
* 30% VUN
* 10% AVUV
* 16% XEF
* 8% XEC
* 6% AVDV

I'm really glad you posted this, because even ignoring the factor aspect, most forecasts suggest US equities are expensive right now and call for international to outperform over the next decade.  The past decade US outperformed, but the previous decade international outperformed.  Diversification is key to consistent returns.  Ben also put out a paper on expected returns: https://www.pwlcapital.com/resources/expected-investment-returns/",MakeTheNetsBigger,79,/r/investing/comments/memnob/ben_felix_proposed_fivefactor_etf_model_portofolio/gsiebsk/,0.011,0.962,0.028,0.2168
44,XEC," Can anyone explain how exactly the ETFs he choses tilt the portfolio towards each of the five factors: market beta, value, small cap, profitability, investment?

My understanding is that he proposes:

* 60% total market exposure - through XIC and VUN
* 16% small cap value - through AVUV and AVDV
* 24% unknown exposure - through XEC and XEF - **towards which factor do these ETFs tilt the portfolio?**

Also, **how are the profitability and investment factors included?**

I see that his ETFs choice is very Canada-oriented. **Would the following choice replicate it well?**

* [VTI](https://etfdb.com/etf/VTI/) or [ITOT](https://etfdb.com/etf/ITOT/) \- 55% (US broad exposure)
* [BBCA](https://etfdb.com/etf/BBCA/) \- 5% (Canada exposure)
* [AVUV](https://etfdb.com/etf/AVUV/) \- 10% (as Felix proposes)
* [AVDV](https://etfdb.com/etf/AVDV/) \- 6% (as Felix proposes)
* [IEFA](https://etfdb.com/etf/IEFA/) \- 16% (substitute for XEF)
* [IEMG](https://etfdb.com/etf/IEMG/) \- 8% (subsititute for XEC)

Than the price per dollar would be less. I’m pretty sure the loonie has been gaining on the dollar since Biden was elected and I contribute that to stimulus. I’m an amateur investor who’s gotten lucky with good gains for the last 8 years. I see things simply. I don’t know how to factor in GDP and with work and family I just don’t have time to calculate that sort of thing. I just form an opinion from information I hear on the news and quick data I see on BNN.

54,ATH," >I understand that part, but the S&P always goes up over a 10 year span.

Nonono. I have a feeling that you suffer from a strong case of recency bias. The S&P500 has done extremely well the last decade but the last decade has been anything but usual for large-cap US equities. Since 1926, [long-term bonds have beaten the S&P500 17.1% over rolling 10 year periods.](https://awealthofcommonsense.com/2020/06/how-often-do-long-term-bonds-beat-stocks/) Even during rolling 20 year old periods, long-term bonds have beaten the S&P500 8.7% of the time. Over the same time period, cash (defined as 1 month T-Bills) beat the S&P500 14.9% of the time, given any 10 year period.


>So why do I need to diversify beyond that?


[Who needs diversification? We all do.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=RR7e1Y-HJxQ)


>So why do all the diversity when the S&P always goes up?


Again, this is [false.](https://www.yardeni.com/pub/sp500corrbeartables.pdf) Throughout time, the S&P500 has gone up but it has also experienced long periods of drawdowns and it takes it a while to get back up to ATH. The longest one started on September 7, 1929 and ended on September 22, 1954. That is just over 25 years (or 9,146 days to be precise) just to get back up to break-even. You might be wondering, ""well...that was a long time ago, why do I care?"" Well...prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the most recent one was from March 9, 2009 until March 28th, 2013. That is about 4 years or so. Prior to that, it was from October 9th, 2002 until May 30th, 2007.

Investing in the S&P500 while having a long-term horizon is a great decision, but it is not as risk-proof as you seem to believe.",Reddit_Man71,4,/r/investing/comments/memnob/ben_felix_proposed_fivefactor_etf_model_portofolio/gsk3xz0/,0.048,0.895,0.056,0.4853
55,IBM," There is a lot of hype around this company.

Things to consider -
1) consulting is not a high margin business, think 12%. If you want a case study on what that does for valuation look no further than IBM.
2) At today's prices, you are paying for 4 years of revenue growth assuming nothing goes wrong. 
3) Their software margin really isn't that good. It's sub 70% which when you compare against Salesforce, Workday, ServiceNow, etc it's really underperforming. 
4) Their co founder just sold 97% of his ownership. You would not do that if you saw huge potential in share price growth.

Things I like:
1) Cyber defense funding isn't going anywhere even during a recession. 
2) I like that they are branching out to corporate to diversify their product line.
3) High barrier to entry for new competitors.

The claim from Palintir themselves is that these costs will dissipate and they'll eventually have a product that can scale without them needing to scale their internal costs along with it. As anyone who has worked in enterprise software knows, this is a very lofty claim and something many companies (IBM, Microsoft, Google, etc.) would love to crack.

100,BB," Yes it will take a while to implement this project, however if other auto manufacturers want to offer FSD then as far as I see it this is the most viable path towards that outcome. BB has the existing relationships with manufacturers, they have the partnership with Amazon and their ML engineers to work on this. It will take time to build out the necessary data collection. Point is, their network could scale more easily than Teslas because Teslas can only grow by selling more of their own cars, whereas isolating the OS and sensors from the manufacturer means it can be deployed more easily.

101,FSD," Yes it will take a while to implement this project, however if other auto manufacturers want to offer FSD then as far as I see it this is the most viable path towards that outcome. BB has the existing relationships with manufacturers, they have the partnership with Amazon and their ML engineers to work on this. It will take time to build out the necessary data collection. Point is, their network could scale more easily than Teslas because Teslas can only grow by selling more of their own cars, whereas isolating the OS and sensors from the manufacturer means it can be deployed more easily.

So if the price is nearly x4 times overpriced like you said ($50), then why aren’t these institutions selling? If you owned a stock that you thought was 4 times overpriced, would you sell for profit? Yes. 

You said the price at the moment is propped up by hopefuls and bag holders. Retail investors currently own just under 20% of the float.

For retail to move this price up from 40 to 180 as of now, they would have to own a far bigger % of the float, which is very possible.

\- Amsterdam Euronext (in EUR), low fees (but a bit pricier), trades \~6.5m USD/day

\- London LSE (in USD), this would be the priciest, trades \~10m USD/day in volume

\- London in GBP, I don't see the upside of trading this

The differences in commissions at the amounts I invest will be \~0.5% more expensive in LSE than in SIX, with Amsterdam somewhat halfway.

In what exchange would you recommend I invest? Should I prioritize minimizing fees (by investing in CHF), or higher volume exchanges? Is there any upside to trading it in USD as it's a US stock ETF? I assume underlying prices are just corrected by FX so there should be no hidden cost there?

151,BA," Hey guys,

New to this Reddit, btw. I have a double major BA in Finance & Accounting. But have professionally only worked in accounting. I am 31, married, 4 kids. I make 55k/year and my wife stays at home with kids. She is planning on going back to work (LPNurse) ~45k/yr in about 5 years. My wife and I each have 5k in our checkings. I have 10k in a 401k from previous job (vanguard), 6k in 401k current job (fidelity), and 15k in stocks/mutual funds (E*TRADE). 

Owe 140k on house, 25k cars, 30k fed student loans. 


I’m thinking that I want to move everything to fidelity? What should my next investment/retirement moves be?

Thanks!",willsonthebus865,1,/r/investing/comments/mexuc3/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gsm7vu8/,0.0,0.955,0.045,0.593
152,GME," I'd say, just like in a casino,

1. Set aside a set amount of money you are prepared to lose, then
2. Set a target price to buy in.

At the current price, I would call GME a ""gamble"" rather than an investment. Why? Because it completely defies everything investors know about fundamentals. And this *must* be put into perspective before you decide to jump in: we don't know exactly how much is shorted, nor do we know how much did the shorts cover; the best we have are guesses based on incomplete data, and that sounds a lot like gambling.

In as much as GameStop is a pretty good company (at a lower price), if you aren't prepared to treat it like a gamble at its current point, you'll get devoured by Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt (FUD) and probably lose money trading emotionally. Should shit ever go down and you get caught holding the bag, you need the emotional resilience to hold long and potentially average down.",d1nner4lunch,5,/r/investing/comments/mexuc3/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gskx7pc/,0.116,0.759,0.125,0.1635
153,GME," GME and other squeeze stocks are musical chairs. They are way above any rational bullish valuation but are high on current attention. To me they are like penny stocks. You can try to turn a quick profit on the action but at some point the music will stop. My personal feeling on these is there is no reason you have to buy these. They are tempting with possible fast returns, but risk is extremely high too which most traders ignore. Most people trading GME here will lose money.",RelativeStrengthPro,1,/r/investing/comments/mexuc3/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gsl4h63/,0.15,0.765,0.086,-0.7662
154,TSLA," Rather than explaining with my own words, here is an example from [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/how-does-one-make-money-short-selling/). 

For example, if an investor thinks that Tesla (TSLA) stock is overvalued at $625 per share, and is going to drop in price, the investor may ""borrow"" 10 shares of TSLA from their broker, who then sells it for the current market price of $625. If the stock goes down to $500, the investor could buy the 10 shares back at this price, return the shares to their broker, and net a profit of $1,250 ($6,250 - $5,000). However, if the TSLA price rises to $700, the investor would lose $750 ($6,250 - $7,000).

Short selling involves amplified risk. When an investor buys a stock (or goes long), they stand to lose only the money that they have invested. Thus, if the investor bought one TSLA share at $625, the maximum they could lose is $625 because the stock cannot drop to less than $0. In other words, the maximum value that any stock can fall to is $0.

However, when an investor short sells, they can theoretically lose an infinite amount of money because a stock's price can keep rising forever. As in the example above, if an investor had a short position in TSLA (or short sold it), and the price rose to $2,000 before the investor exited, the investor would lose $1,325 per share.",hywelbane87,1,/r/investing/comments/mexuc3/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gslknpm/,0.08,0.844,0.075,-0.3182

All are ishares bc they’re the only ones available on my broker at the time I started. Don’t know the tickers. The sustainability aspect is pretty important to me so I only picked ETFs my conscience is cool with. It’s a double edged sword with them being emitted by BlackRock I feel but I figured I gotta start somewhere. 

Only the first two are in the green right now but I just started in February this year so fingers crossed ;).
