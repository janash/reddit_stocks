On the positive side, I can’t think of any company that moved up earnings dates because they had bad news. They also hired some new execs who majority want to be paid in stock.

Also the timing of forcing the warrants with moving up earnings is a big gamble and the timing is too coincidental. I’m bullish and I think it’s on bargain basement pricing so I added more to my position.

No institutions are selling besides Vanguard who re-allocated some shares across their funds and multiple other institutions (existing + new) have been accumulating. Finally, r/clov has almost grown to 40k apes who are all buying the very small remaining float. So, why is the price still going down? $CLOV is also recalling all their warrants years earlier than expiration at a rock bottom price which means they don't need the capital and the float will be diluted as little as possible compared to what it could have been. Not going to argue, the chart looks ugly right now but there is no explanation for the downtrend besides market manipulation and massive shorting/naked shorting to explain it.

290,AMD," Do you have a source which says that nobody ever sells cash-covered or naked calls?

Obviously the percentage of which is covered or not covered is a moving target for any stock on any given day. If I knew that statistic, I'd be able to see into all the accounts at any given time and if I could do that I probably wouldn't be making AMD calls. I can say with certainty that if it were an all-or-nothing thing then gamma events wouldn't occur, but they do so obviously there's an effect even if it's a moving target as to how much.

Also, what do large funds do when covered calls gets assigned for a stock which is moving up in price? They buy back in. It's not like AMD is a one-turn stock with no future. THAT generates buy pressure. Even if you don't want to look at that as a thing, I still talked about the options trends as a signal of sentiment.

I don't really get the point of the intensity of the argument. I acknowledged your point and said it's probably mostly true, just not an all or nothing thing... take the win, man. :)",Moist_Lunch_5075,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/or8oya/amd_dds_i_mean_tna/h6i5qmm/,0.063,0.864,0.072,0.601
291,AMD," I’m just seeing this point repeated a lot and it’s incorrect. So I’m not as much trying to win argument as just point out incorrect information that may mislead people. If you were correct gamma squeeze type of events would happen after option expirations, but that’s not the case. Most commonly the counter party that sells you the calls is the market maker. As they sell the call they buy shares to stay delta neutral. The calls are not fully covered because generally the delta <1. If the stock price shoots up, the delta goes up as well and it forces MMs to keep buying shares (also other calls but I’m simplifying) to maintain neutral delta. This is done automatically with algos to avoid losses. By the time options expire they are fully hedged and the shares that were bought are either released or transferred off the exchange. That’s why ITM option expiration doesn’t impact the price anymore because its impact on the price already happened.


Anyway AMD is good stock obviously, nothing against it, I like it too. But Mondays are not that magical. The only real impact of option expiration especially after monthlies expire that I can see is that the price starts moving more liberally as it’s less slowed down by hedging at strikes with high OI, so there is less pinning too.

293,AMD," Honestly, and I don't think I did a great job expressing this in my post, the bigger signal I'm getting from the options chain is about sentiment. If you add all of it, it's still <1% of AMD's market cap, so by itself even if they were all naked/cash covered or generated equal buying pressure in some other way, it's still not going to move the stock very much... BUT it does indicate significant market sentiment in favor of AMD given the volume of contracts, the stark disparity between competition over time for calls versus puts, and the range of interest in the higher strata.

Of course, that doesn't by itself create upward force on the price, but as tea leaves and entrails go, the options chain actually have substantive inputs that speak to sentiment direction and willingness to bring capital.",Moist_Lunch_5075,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/or8oya/amd_dds_i_mean_tna/h6ibm6d/,0.04,0.865,0.096,0.8567

334,EDU, I'm not for investments like this but Honestly I think your bet or calculated price prediction for EDU ONLY hitting $6 bucks in 3-6 months is about 3-6 x to low.

335,CLEU," For a swing trade I like CLEU alot. Is only trading at 50% of cash on hand ATM which was raised via a private offering to people with social connections to management at what was something like a 25% premium to share price at the time. It's also in the middle of a giant acquisition and has never posted a negative EPS, even during covid. 

Finally it took a big hit with the rest of Chinese edu stocks, but the proposed regs don't even affect it because CLEU isn't in compulsory education so I expect it to swing back up from that.",starwatcher16253647,0,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/or5nge/chinese_education_stock_idea_edu_time_to_long_is/h6g779c/,0.0,0.906,0.094,0.7351
336,ONE," You have absolutely no idea how these commies think mate. You think this is some ""Free Market Capitalism"" America shit? 

Let me tell you how it works in commieland. The CCP is the absolute mafia there. Everybody else is their bitch. Its not like America where the billionaire capitalists have significant influence behind the scenes. The average lifespan of a billionaire there is LESS than 40 years old. Look at Jack Ma the richest cunt there. Forced to keep quiet and disappear for a few months. Money doesnt mean shit when the commies control every industry and sources of capital. Billionaires & companies are replaceable.

Now, granted I didnt read your long ass bullshit post but i know for a fact that you have no idea how these commies think. You must understand the china culture- everything is done from a collective perspective. Oh, your 1000 investors are going to lose money? Who the fuck cares we have 1 billion people lives to think about. Shutting down the private education sector has been their top priority now. Why? Because it promotes inequality-rich kids get an advantage which is an absolute no-no because commies are supposed to be equal remember? NEVER forget the commie dream- ONE China ONE people BLah Blah blah prosper together Blah Blah

Now, dont get me wrong- fuck these commies i never liked them. But your trade idea and holdings are totally fucked.

I'm not understanding what the allegations are suggesting. Are they hiding profit and writing things down as expenses and embezzling money? It doesn't make sense to me that a company would want to hide profitability. SEC investigated in August then IQIYI seemed to refute and publish their numbers later and are coorporating with SEC.
