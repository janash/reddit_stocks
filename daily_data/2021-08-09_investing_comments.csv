59,CI," I'm a CI user (before implantation i wore hearing aids for 30+ years) and it's usually a fight to get insurance to pay for hearing aids or CIs.  I don't think OTC devices are going to make an immediate impact for those who require audiologists to find their needs. CIs are a medical device and I don't see those becoming OTC anytime within several decades.  If a person is legally deaf, then there isn't much point of an OTC hearing aid because their needs are going to be specific to the individual.

For general hearing loss, OTCs would probably shine a lot and there would be a huge market for these but there is an issue with people buying OTC hearing aids and end up damaging their ears further because of an improper hearing aid. Those OTC companies can potentially be held responsible for failure to educate the buyer.

I feel that this market has some advantages of growth from this kind of competition, but the risks are on the high end.

I believe Advanced Bionics owns Phonak in some way.

Btw, you can switch CI implants when it comes time for an upgrade of the implant due to different reasons. So you could go from Advanced Bionics to Cochlear America if desired.

65,CI," My deaf/hoh friends don't care about the price of their CI/hearing aids because the majority of them get support through VR or through Medicaid that covers 100% of the cost. 

I think the coverage of service will vary by state. My parents had to pay out of pocket because they didn't know about what services were available back in the day. Since High School, I was able to sign myself up for things like Medicaid and VR and get all my devices and surgery covered. Today, I have a full-time job, and my insurance balks at covering CIs but it usually takes some phone called to get things resolved.  Right now I'm working with VR to get a CI upgrade and they will help reimburse me for anything my insurance does not cover because I require a CI for my job.",Blwillia,2,/r/investing/comments/p158bw/getting_ahead_in_hearing_aid_investing_before_law/h8b6qyd/,0.021,0.899,0.08,0.804
66,CVS," I'm a skeptic. I gave what you wrote a more thorough read and agree you have good points. My comparison about Warby Parker is not really related to any OTC reading glasses you may be able to buy in a CVS.

I used to pay $200-300 for new glasses + another $400-600 for new contacts every year as my eyesight continues to get worsen. Instead of continuing to do that, I now stick to glasses. I pay $50 to get my prescription updated at the doctor's. I then take that online to eyebuydirect and buy a good-looking pair of $14 frames with $40 lenses and I wear those for over a year.

People who are aging are more technology-savvy and trusting than their predecessors.  The absurd costs and profits of hearing aids is now more publically known. People will be looking for an alternative.

I ended my interviews for a digital marketing job at a big hearing aid company in the US because I thought it was unethical that they could be making that much money on seniors just to spend it on advertising.

This is an area primed for major disruption in the following years. It is begging for a better solution.

However, ears are different from eyes and those are different from teeth. I am not an expert in the field. Align is a company that also advertises heavily and is able to get young people to pay thousands of dollars on their products.

86,ATH," Hello! 

I recently rolled over my ROTH 401K to a Roth IRA. I now have \~$30k that I'd like to invest. I plan to deploy most of the balance into a target date index fund through Fidelity. My question really has to do with market timing. I was initially thinking of just dumping all the money in at once, but I would literally be investing at the funds ATH. Granted, this investment will sit in the account for another 35 years, so perhaps it really doesn't matter if I DCA or if I just lump sum invest it. Any thoughts? Has anyone experienced a similar situation? 

I also plan to save about 20% for individual stock picks. I actually just started a very small position in Tesla. Any other individual growth stocks you might recommended socking away into this account?

87,ES," I'd love to crowdsource some ideas on the Russell 2000 (/RTY) and the S&P 500 (/ES) and the underlying risks, headwinds, and tailwinds in the coming months / years.  
/ES is HUGE; \~$220K contract size, somewhat volatile, and shows no signs of slowing the current melt-up. However, I see it as very high risk because 25% of the total weighting is FAANG and tech heavyweights, which I'm unsure how would be impacted by inflation as a headwind. The market seems to not really care about a Delta variant, so not too worried. Besides inflation, I see a black swan as the real risk (war, etc) in which case I'm less worried about my portfolio than I am extrinsic factors.  
/RTY is more reasonably sized; \~$110K contract size, more sideways, because of that sideways action it's also somewhat amicable to my strategy. Because it's much better diversified with 2000 companies (in theory), and the boogeyman meme stock risk is low (\~2% of total holdings if I had to guess), the risk is more economic in nature, i.e., inflation. However, I'm also not sure how the Russell would be impacted by rate rises if and when they happen.  
I anticipate the Russell 2000 underperforming the S&P 500, which is fine for my strategy. However, how do you anticipate inflation or a rate rise (call it 1% for simplicity) impacting either index? Does that ""flatten"" the >15% stellar COVID returns to a more reasonable 5% stable market returns? Does it cause a 10% correction before the melt up resumes at a reduced rate? Does it cause a 2008+ bear market that drifts downward 20% to 50% from ATHs over the next 3 years? How would the response of the Russell vs. the S&P 500 differ? What other headwinds and tailwinds or systemic risks do you seem in the coming few months for the Russell 2000 and S&P 500?

90,TWO," I would pose that this need not be an either/or scenario.  If, for example, you invested 20K of the 80K and that investment gains 10% over a year, you are up 2K on your 80K (2.5%) that is doing nothing, at least partially offsetting the spending power losses of 80K sitting for 12-18 months. The one thing I would not do is go all in at once with some portion of the  80K.  If it were me, I would put 20K in, increasing that with say half of the weekly deposit amount.  There are indexed ETFs and some alternative investment choices you might consider.  Since this is all about housing, you might consider something like TWO, a real-estate play that is paying 10+% dividends, with the idea that if housing jumps 10-15%, your future down payment is moving in line with that.

100,USA," I'd be cautious on investing in Chinese EDU stocks. In all honesty, the measures they took for the EDU stocks makes sense for the betterment of their society. For profit education in general can be dangerous and may not have society's best interest in mind. Prime examples are for profit colleges in the USA. That being said, I'm not sure of the incentives the Chinese Government has to walk back their mandate on EDU stocks, other than the potential impact on other foreign investors in other Chinese stocks (but even crashing the Chinese market makes a certain amount of sense as well).

When Lehman collapsed in the USA SIPC didn't even really have to get involved , sure some investments were tied up for a while but with in days over 100 billion was transferred to other brokerages

Even when Maddoff brokerage collapsed (the brokerage was separate from the hedge fund) again the assets were transferred mostly in an orderly fashion and SIPC didn't get involved on the brokerage side.

In 2008 when lehman collapsed SIPC didn't even really need to get involved as all assets were transferred to other brokerages in a few days. I am not sure if I know of any cases where people actually lost money do to brokerage insolvency

MF Global is a glaring example of this not really being entirely true.  I'd agree it's incredibly rare - but it happens, and people lost money.

107,MF," I always thought that SIPC's involvement with MF Global was only limited to the liquidation. And that because many of the MF Global accounts are futures accounts - those accounts were not insured by SIPC. 

I'm pretty sure that SIPC insurance doesn't cover regular futures accounts which were a bulk of MF Global accounts. And why many account holders weren't made whole.",greytoc,2,/r/investing/comments/p10auk/terms_of_service_is_insolvency_risk_of_broker/h8bk876/,0.03,0.883,0.087,0.5574
