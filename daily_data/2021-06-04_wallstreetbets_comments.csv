591,AMC," The people/companies who bought it paid $1.17 for each right to buy one piece of stock at $145 on June 4 (that's today).

If the stock costs less than that on the open market, the right they bought is worthless, because why would you buy at $145 when you can get it cheaper.

If the stock goes to $146... they still lost money because they spent more than a dollar on the right.

If the stock goes to $150, they can buy it for $145, sell for $150, make $5 (minus the $1.17 they spent) for a massive profit.

It's a bet that loses unless the stock makes it to $146.17, then pays off massively.

That's how those massive gain porn screenshots are generated - it rarely goes well, but if it does... tendies.

Oh, also, a contract is 100 units if I'm not mistaken. So if the number is correct, overall, investors and gamblers put $20M into this bet that is highly unlikely to pay off.

Note that not all of this has to be WSB apes gambling, options are also used to e.g. limit risk (""hedging""). Imagine you promised someone 100 pieces of AMC stock tomorrow as part of some other trade. You can afford to take a little risk, but if it goes over $145, that's too much for you... So you pay $117 (100x1.17) to make sure that in the unlikely case it goes up even more, you can at least get it for $145.

~~But I suspect most of it are WSB gamblers.~~ edit: the last sentence was a guess and there are good arguments below why this could be all hedging.",aaaaaaaarrrrrgh,18,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nrujso/amc_has_only_46124_shares_left_to_issue_and_they/h0jjkfw/,0.076,0.855,0.069,-0.0355

Let's moon apes.",johnnygalt1776,5,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nrujso/amc_has_only_46124_shares_left_to_issue_and_they/h0jb9zk/,0.058,0.792,0.151,0.8192
602,NOW," Sort of, they only lose the money that it cost them to buy that contract. That‚Äôs why a short is different than a call (obviously they also go different directions because short = you betting it goes down) because on a short you can lose infinite money (if the prices keeps going up) but on calls you can only lose the amount you paid for the contracts and then they may expire worthless.

Edit: 

For how much you make: The contract is a right to buy the stock at that price. So if buying calls at 145 for .4 cents, it must go higher than 145.4 for you to make money overall on the transaction. If it hit 160 you would make 160  - 145 - .4 which is 14.6. But then if your contract is actually for 100 shares, you make 1460. If the stock finishes below 145 you will lose the amount you paid ( .4 ), and if it finishes between 145 and 145.4 then you lose (final price - 145.4).

Edit 2: this is the case if you exercise the calls. HOWEVER you can also SELL the calls to someone else if your position is improving BEFORE they expire. For example if you bought the calls when it was 100, but now the price is up at 140 and there is still 2 weeks left to get to 145, your option contract is now worth more, and people will be willing to pay for it. As a replier said, the premium may NOW be .6, even though you bought at .4 . The option is now yours to sell if you choose (pun intended), so you can sell at .6 and collect the .2 per share (which will be 20).  Overall this is what most people do because others/the market will pay a premium on the chance that it keeps going up, while in reality it may just be 50/50 by the time you sell or maybe even lower in your opinion if it‚Äôs hit its ceiling. In my opinion it‚Äôs the best move to do that, unless you are confident the stock will keep going up, because you never really know with volatility.",OrangElm,134,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nrujso/amc_has_only_46124_shares_left_to_issue_and_they/h0jofab/,0.062,0.875,0.063,0.4678

607,AMC," I hope you are right.  What I am saying is I tripled my profit. I am out on principle and I am good. 

 If AMC wasnt paying their CEOS and board members 100-300  mil in shares, bonuses and salaries every year they wouldnt be in debt and they wouldnt have to sell shares.  Blow me whoever thinks AMC and these other crappy companies ceos are due a 20mil salary plus bonuses and shares every year.  They drove that company to the ground every year if they couldnt survive a pandemic.  Government was giving out loans and handouts to these big corps.  How did they get billions in debt?  Because even though they were making 20mil a year they didnt Forsee something like this happening?  Im mean noone saw covid happeing but something like it.  Their whole plan has been getting people in to the theaters.  Paying 30 for oily popcorn and dried up hotdogs and $30 for tickets $100 for a whole family?   Tell me they deserve that kind of salary every year.  

They dont care about the cause.  Strictly greed for them.   So yeah im covering my ass too and getting out.  Im not going to get left holding the bag while those guys get 2 mil bonuses for running a failing business.

They were not cheated they simply failed to put in the time to understand what they are buying.

989,BB," OP bought 7 contracts at 5.80$ premium an option. One contract holds 100 options so op bought the right to buy 700 shares at 24$ until expiration on 6/11. Also OP is a true degenerate for buying options 1 week short of expiration at this prenium. His breakeven is 29.80 (24$ strike price + 5.80 prenium), so once BB hits 29.80 OP would make 100% return on investment for every 5.80 BB goes over 29.80. The higher the premium the less gains you can make and the less worth it gets to take the risk as you lose your investment if expir comes and you never broke even. Basically if everything works perfectly OP will make like 100 to 300% gains, if it goes expectedly he will lose everything. Completely different story if you buy your calls before everything is overhyped af. I got my Juli 15C at 95 Cents so for every 95 cent BB rises over 15.95 i make 100% return on investment if I were to exercise my calls (buy the shares at strike price). You can also sell your contracts to make money on expectations (15C are worth 4.50 even tough BB is not at 19.50).",addicteded,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ns6fwq/bb_are_you_guys_coming_to_get_me/h0kw4x6/,0.056,0.832,0.111,0.8924

1014,BB," I remember my first BlackBerry. I got hired on full time at Fidelity Investments and they issued me one. It was GLORIOUS. Yes, the web browser was locked down and proxied through the company BES, but the keyboard beat the hell out of the Motorola RAZR I had as a personal phone. As soon as my contract was up, I traded the RAZR in for a BB Curve 8830 (which I STILL have, I just don't have a battery for it).

Looks like the short % of float is bit bigger than Jan although that doesn‚Äôt really matter. What I found interesting is that alpha trading signals trigger came off today and it was the RSI 90-100 and that also came off back in jan (23rd I think?). The volume yesterday was higher than any day in Jan (I think). Combined with RSI trigger coming off yesterday as well this all looks super super bullish.

1095,BB," Yeah so when you sell a covered call you ""sell to open"" which means you're selling and opening the contract. If you want to buy that contract back for whatever reason you can ""buy to close"" and re-buy back the contract. So I sold it for I think 10-15 dollars and then rebought at 27, so I lost out on that intial income but wanted to avoid having my covered call exercised against me in the case that BB increased significantly over the strike price.

Yahoo finance is just showing 0 OI for all strikes, [this site](https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/AMC/options?moneyness=allRows) is showing OI (about 1/10 volume overall).  It only goes up to 120 strike, not sure if that's just the site's free tier showing limited data or if all the options higher were closed out in today's trading.

There are a *shitload* of options outstanding.  Remember that gamma can also work against a stock, as expiry approaches OTM hedges get released, pushing the option further OTM (for both calls and puts).  It's going to be fireworks, especially towards the end of the day.

Unless the majority immediately reinvests their options profits into shares and/or calls for next week there is a chance that we see a death spiral today like we did last Friday as the MM unloads 20-30 million shares from open contracts that weren't exercised and hundreds of thousands of call contracts go from ITM to OTM.

The expiration is today so that means as the expiration approaches,  the price of the call starts to rapidly fall to zero. It doesn‚Äôt even gradually fall because it‚Äôs not linear. The ‚Äúspeed,‚Äù of the fall to zero accelerates rapidly. If the stock dips just a little, the fall to zero quickens. If the stock blips up the call will still lose value because the expiration is today and the contract is far out of the money. 

The only thing I can imagine someone doing this is if they sold to open 173k calls, (they wrote and sold the call options to someone) and so they bought the calls to close and take profit because they will be having testicle reduction surgery today and don‚Äôt want to risk their shares being assigned and sold at 145 on the off chance that AMC goes to $300.",wiserone29,17,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nry4p8/somebody_bought_173000_amc_call_contracts_strike/h0jicb2/,0.031,0.898,0.071,0.6124

1642,ANY," Disallow short selling for those stocks in general, or naked shorts on those stocks. Big difference in terms of how the stock price could sky rocket...

e.g
But 1,000 stocks during dip, wait until it goes up, sell 500 stocks and also sell 5 covered shorts, wait until goes down, buy more stocks at dip with profits and then do it again. Allowing shorts of ANY kind will still affect the market by allowing the potential for market manipulation for funds that have the massive purchasing power to do this.

1681,GME," I was under the impression that the driving force behind the squeeze was the fact that GME was shorted over 100% of float.  And the assumption being thrown around is that, despite what's being reported, GME remains over 250% shorted (being hid by some creative reporting).  

So if other institutions follow suit, wouldn't that mean that these short sellers would need to buy out their positions?  And wouldn't that mean that the demand for the stock would shoot up?  And since they need to buy out 250% of a stock that has less than 100% of its shares being floated, wouldn't that mean they CANNOT buy out of that position?  And wouldn't that mean that the price would go up indefinitely?

1692,AMC," >If I have to buy x of a stock, but I can only buy x-1 of the stock, doesn't the holder of that last 1 unit get to set a charge price as high as the moon?

Yes, but what happens when no one is allowed to speculatively borrow anymore shares in the future?  More short interest is generated by more overvaluation and high RSI indicators.

From the bank's perspective.. when the person they allowed to borrow can't cover the bank holds bag so if it becomes a trend these brokerages and banks can blacklist at their discretion because they have a responsibility to their depositors.. and when the bank is irresponsible and has to cover for a bankrupt investor FDIC has to print money to cover those deposits and bail out the bank.

So what happens when you have a stock you can no longer force anyone to buy at an overvalued price?  That is essentially the speculative trading pool they are trying to cut off.

As for AMC at this point.. 80% of the shares are owned by retail investors and there is only 13% short interest.  Doing the math, that 80% of retail investors will bid themselves down to be the first to cover that 13% of short interest.

1832,AMC," well where do I begin. sorry I don't wanna be patronising in any way, its just a lot and I don't have much time.

1. shorts do not have to cover. I might get downvoted for this, because many ppl here (want to) believe that, but there is simply no law or rule or contract that says shortsellers have to cover. the may decide to cover if they fear their losses might rise or the interest they have to pay on borrowed shares becomes too expensive. in many ways, shorting is the exact opposite as holding shares. if you hold shares, nobody can force you to sell. you may decide to hold your red position for ages until it becomes green again. if you short sell, you may do the same (and pay interest; but if that interest is like 0.1%, who cares)
2. AMC can (and did) issue new shares. company value stays the same, but share float rises. its called dilution and usually bad for investors (bc all of a sudden you own less of the same company). in 99% of cases though, when you buy a share, you dont buy it from the company, you buy it from a random stock holder who sold it in the same second).

bottom line is, its simply impossible to predict when shortsellers cover. the amount of shares the company can still issue (46k in this case) is basically irrelevant in that regard.",jp_taxguy,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nrxupf/amc_and_bb_both_have_potential_research_and_put/h0l1rdn/,0.072,0.783,0.145,0.9625

1834,AMC," Right, so I understand both of these points. I guess I'm confused by the logistics of it. AMC has stated that after yesterday, it won't be issuing new shares until 2022. With retailers owning 80% of the votes, that seems to ring true. But I guess I'm still trying to understand the who synthetic/borrowed shares thing. If there shares do not exist, then the HF are losing money as we all HODL. And I guess I understand that shorts do not have to cover but it's probably ideal for them to eventually. 

When/if they do, and in this scenario everyone else is HODL, are their only option to buy back in the remaining 46k shares that AMC has? That's all I'm trying to understand. Will the demand be high among HFs because they all suddenly want back in?",billie_holiday,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nrxupf/amc_and_bb_both_have_potential_research_and_put/h0l2pp8/,0.046,0.83,0.124,0.8888

Electrification has its use cases, 100%. Commuter vehicles and last mile deliveries, possibly public transport depending on location but that‚Äôs about where that ends. It also conveniently ignores the fact that electrified vehicles are also inherently dirty due to manufacturing, waste, actually charging them (which is still done by fossils.) 

Hydrogen, at best, is 10 years away. And that‚Äôs from it being a feasible technology to actually be used in transportation. What about infrastructure? Decades away from meeting scale. 

RNG is here now, and is the alternative to long haul transportation. especially when the only feasible alternative is diesel. Yes, more facilities need to be built out but the infrastructure and technology is already there on scale. 

The energy reallocation cannot be a one trick pony. Electrification will not solve every problem our transportation has. It will solve some, and RNG will fill in the gaps where electrifying is unfeasible. You can‚Äôt just slap thousands of lbs worth of batteries on long haulers and expect it to work, let alone be economical.

Which is funny because if RNG is going to lead to its own extinction, then it sure doesn‚Äôt help hydrogen fuel by doing so as it directly produces hydrogen fuel as a byproduct. 

The green hydrogen you‚Äôre so stuck on that would be produced by solar+wind would require such an immense amount of both that I‚Äôm curious as to how you expect to achieve the fuels required for our transport industry, and at the same time power the entire electrical grid given that both technologies are geographically limited? 

Take solar. In NYC to install a run-of-the-mill solar setup on a townhome ranged anywhere from 80k-145k depending on the contractor. The panels would‚Äôve lasted MAYBE 15 years given our lovely weather, and would‚Äôve generated enough electricity to offset running a kitchen 2x a day for 3months of the year.

2173,RNG, Gennerally it costs 300% more to use RNG and it produces the same amount of emissions so not really solving an emissions issue. RNG has a limitation on how much gas you can get from Cow farts so it won't scale up. The carbon negative claim is so crazy that it doesn't make any physical or thermodynamics sense. Good luck with the bet but I doubt it is a game changer.,Great-Lychee,-3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nrq2i4/cow_farts_and_the_philosophers_stone_how_we/h0isq3o/,0.145,0.803,0.052,-0.7241
2174,RNG," In this case carbon negative is a bit of a misnomer. They're not carbon negative in the way most people think (ie sucking carbon out of the atmosphere like a tree or Aether Diamonds) but they are carbon dioxide equivalent negative. The greenhouse gases emitted through the use of renewable natural gas (RNG) are less than those emitted by the feedstock (methane) if it were left alone. 

Since different greenhouse gases have different warming potentials they are converted to carbon dioxide equivalents (1 metric ton of x = y metric tons of CO2) for the purposes of comparison. Methane (cow farts, manure, etc) has a CO2e of roughly 30. 

So when RNG is made from methane some of it goes into making trucks go vroom and some goes into the atmosphere as CO2 (not as potent as methane). When you leave the cow shit alone, it sits there happily producing methane and roasting us to death. 

The big potential for RNG is not in reducing emissions (which it does do) but in waste management. It literally turns shit into cash. 

It is also a bitch to remove methane from the atmosphere so it's better if there are any emissions, they are CO2 rather than methane. Atmospheric methane's only real sink is bacteria in the soil (most commonly found in forest floors). There are machines that can scrub CO2 from the atmosphere and turn it into diamonds. All we got for methane is a bunch of trees close together. 

So go invest in RNG and üíé‚úä some üå≥üå≤üå≥.

Essentially if Amazon came by and decided they wanted to buy up one of either AMC or Cinemark, it is the EV they would use to compare total price to pay for both. That is because they would have to buy all the shares and take on the debt, but would then get the cash from the balance sheet, after buying the company.

Now in reality, they would have to pay a premium to the current share price to get shareholders to sign off on the purchase, but it's a good starting point to see the entire worth of a company.

IF AMC was $5/share, it's market cap would be around $2b +$1.1b in debt - $800m in cash= $2.3b EV.  CNK EV is currently at $6.13b.  Given that AMC is the largest publicly traded in the sector, with double the amount of theatres worldwide of CNK, let's just say AMC EV should be double CNK (fundamentals, right?).  So if the EV SHOULD be $12.26b, the reverse math would be $12.23b EV - $800m cash + $1.1b debt= $12.53b market cap.  That is 6X the $2b amount above, meaning the actual share price SHOULD be 6X $5= $30 / share.

2683,AMC," really? If youre serious market cap is total shares x share price. Giving you the total value of the company. 

So all your maths are wrong, or... theyre calculating the wrong thing anyway. You can just look at market cap and see that AMC's valuation is way way way ridiculously too high compared to simular companies.

All you did was calculate how high cinemark share price would have to be ($169) to be as equally overvalued as AMC.",Raceg35,6,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nrvwe7/serious_question_for_amc_apes/h0j0fr2/,0.113,0.759,0.127,0.0609

2685,AMC," I'm seeing one main number that is differing a lot for me. I'm seeing AMC with $5.4B in debt, the same $800M in cash, so I get an EV of $6.6B at $5/share vs the $6.1B for CNK. Also you didn't actually reverse the math. From the $12.3B, we need to subtract the $5.4B, but add $800M, so $7.7B for theoretical market cap of where AMC should trade, which would be closer to 4x the $2B. That would mean by your statement of AMC should be worth about double CNK, it would give a price target of $20, still a far cry from that guy's $0.01 price target.

I will add a caveat that I'd have to check all the above numbers versus the SEC filings. I was just looking at Seeking Alpha for my data, so please excuse me if any of it is incorrect. It also adds an extra layer of complexity that AMC just sold at least 20M shares, but has raised over $1B this quarter (I think it means they have certainly sold more than the 20M shares sold recently). This is still good for the overall math of AMC being worth more than $20/share, because they sold shares for more than that, or at least all the ones sold in the last week were.

In the end, I think that analyst has a $0.01 price target for shock value. I'm sure he wouldn't put any money down on them hitting $0.01 within a year, even if he does think they'll eventually go bankrupt somewhere several/many years from now. One thing is definitely true from all this though- it bought AMC a lot of time to try to change around their business to a format that works again. Hopefully they can turn around the trends of the past couple decades.

2876,TSLA," I‚Äôve decided to go full BB and PLTR ape this month. BB is no where NEAR done. It‚Äôs just getting start. 

PLTR got amazing news as well. Invested $230 million in Babylons Health SPAC merger to go public. A great long term partnership will begin. Great things are going to come out of that. They are investing in billionaire tech company‚Äôs like Google and Intel. The CEO knows what the future holds for the company.

This month is going to be fun you apes. üëêüíé 

Don‚Äôt let today get to you that much. We have the weekend now. Let‚Äôs all get high, have a drink, have happy thoughts, and be prepared for anything on Monday. üëêüíé

Cheers. üç∏üçª

EDIT: Anyone curious on my PLTR and BB postions, for PLTR, I decided to switch my TSLA calls to PLTR and I averaged my calls WAY down. I have 27$ calls that were .34, now .21, and I have 35$ 6-25 calls that were .31, now .17

A fleet of trucks can NOT sit there for hours to recharge, and having to spend the juice to haul the HEAVY BATTERY PACKS, on top of the cargo.  

Hydrogen doesn‚Äôt have the infrastructure.  CLNE made the smart decision to build filling stations RIGHT NEXT to Amazon warehouses.  

Also, it‚Äôs much easier AND cheaper to adopt current gas engines to run natural gas...can‚Äôt say that about hydrogen nor ev.

Whether you are in it for short term swing or long term hold...it‚Äôs hard to go wrong...especially at this pps.

For larger purchases in order of hundreds of thousands dollars plus, yes, PFOF hurts.

But then again, at that point, go to an actual brokerage.

Also, not every brokerage practices PFOF. That's up to you as a customer to choose. There are free trade brokerages like Fidelity/Vanguard/Merrill Edge/etc. that has no PFOF.

And you can always pay for IBKR Pro if you really need execution speed on options market and all.
