591,AMC," The people/companies who bought it paid $1.17 for each right to buy one piece of stock at $145 on June 4 (that's today).

If the stock costs less than that on the open market, the right they bought is worthless, because why would you buy at $145 when you can get it cheaper.

If the stock goes to $146... they still lost money because they spent more than a dollar on the right.

If the stock goes to $150, they can buy it for $145, sell for $150, make $5 (minus the $1.17 they spent) for a massive profit.

It's a bet that loses unless the stock makes it to $146.17, then pays off massively.

That's how those massive gain porn screenshots are generated - it rarely goes well, but if it does... tendies.

Oh, also, a contract is 100 units if I'm not mistaken. So if the number is correct, overall, investors and gamblers put $20M into this bet that is highly unlikely to pay off.

Note that not all of this has to be WSB apes gambling, options are also used to e.g. limit risk (""hedging""). Imagine you promised someone 100 pieces of AMC stock tomorrow as part of some other trade. You can afford to take a little risk, but if it goes over $145, that's too much for you... So you pay $117 (100x1.17) to make sure that in the unlikely case it goes up even more, you can at least get it for $145.

602,NOW," Sort of, they only lose the money that it cost them to buy that contract. That’s why a short is different than a call (obviously they also go different directions because short = you betting it goes down) because on a short you can lose infinite money (if the prices keeps going up) but on calls you can only lose the amount you paid for the contracts and then they may expire worthless.

Edit: 

For how much you make: The contract is a right to buy the stock at that price. So if buying calls at 145 for .4 cents, it must go higher than 145.4 for you to make money overall on the transaction. If it hit 160 you would make 160  - 145 - .4 which is 14.6. But then if your contract is actually for 100 shares, you make 1460. If the stock finishes below 145 you will lose the amount you paid ( .4 ), and if it finishes between 145 and 145.4 then you lose (final price - 145.4).

Edit 2: this is the case if you exercise the calls. HOWEVER you can also SELL the calls to someone else if your position is improving BEFORE they expire. For example if you bought the calls when it was 100, but now the price is up at 140 and there is still 2 weeks left to get to 145, your option contract is now worth more, and people will be willing to pay for it. As a replier said, the premium may NOW be .6, even though you bought at .4 . The option is now yours to sell if you choose (pun intended), so you can sell at .6 and collect the .2 per share (which will be 20).  Overall this is what most people do because others/the market will pay a premium on the chance that it keeps going up, while in reality it may just be 50/50 by the time you sell or maybe even lower in your opinion if it’s hit its ceiling. In my opinion it’s the best move to do that, unless you are confident the stock will keep going up, because you never really know with volatility.",OrangElm,134,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nrujso/amc_has_only_46124_shares_left_to_issue_and_they/h0jofab/,0.062,0.875,0.063,0.4678

612,AA," So far it seems they can stay afloat for now especially with the cash they generated. That debt is really a burden though. 

I was initially upset about the shares sold but AA technically didn't lie. He wasn't going to sell new shares except that they had some that had been approved for this year which is now down to the 47,000. 

Not to mention I invested in AMC to support it because I absolutely love the movies. If it means they can survive for longer then I shouldn't complain.

613,AMC," So far it seems they can stay afloat for now especially with the cash they generated. That debt is really a burden though. 

I was initially upset about the shares sold but AA technically didn't lie. He wasn't going to sell new shares except that they had some that had been approved for this year which is now down to the 47,000. 

Not to mention I invested in AMC to support it because I absolutely love the movies. If it means they can survive for longer then I shouldn't complain.

They triggered last week and  sure it stung a little but I already made money back and they triggered at a 60% gain. Did I get a little trigger finger itch to buy back in? Yes. Did I pull it? Hell no, that ties back into the obvious greed lessons learned mentioned from GME.

It opens up a whole new world and gives you more tools to succeed.

What is even more sad is people do not realize when they FOMO into an option position with a sky high IV that it is VERY difficult and rare for the value to continue to skyrocket. 

If they FOMO into a stock they can recover but they FOMO into a high IV call position and even if the stock rises a bit the IV crush slaughters them and they have no idea what happened and feel cheated.

They were not cheated they simply failed to put in the time to understand what they are buying.

941,ARE," Wages at the bottom need to go up, period.

No business should be paying anyone poverty or below poverty wages for a day’s work. 

By allowing that, it throws everything else askew. Businesses that pay wages at or below poverty and thus necessitating their employees be on public assistance should be charge five to ten times the amount for “administrative fees” to cover the difference between what their wages are and what the local cost of living is.

That alone would put a lot of shit companies out of business, but it would also cause relative wages to increase, while simultaneously removing the expense of a welfare state supporting people whose ARE working one or more jobs as many hours as they are able to obtain.",Strange-Scarcity,-1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ns0z3c/holding_strong_bb/h0khgee/,0.097,0.852,0.051,-0.3071

989,BB," OP bought 7 contracts at 5.80$ premium an option. One contract holds 100 options so op bought the right to buy 700 shares at 24$ until expiration on 6/11. Also OP is a true degenerate for buying options 1 week short of expiration at this prenium. His breakeven is 29.80 (24$ strike price + 5.80 prenium), so once BB hits 29.80 OP would make 100% return on investment for every 5.80 BB goes over 29.80. The higher the premium the less gains you can make and the less worth it gets to take the risk as you lose your investment if expir comes and you never broke even. Basically if everything works perfectly OP will make like 100 to 300% gains, if it goes expectedly he will lose everything. Completely different story if you buy your calls before everything is overhyped af. I got my Juli 15C at 95 Cents so for every 95 cent BB rises over 15.95 i make 100% return on investment if I were to exercise my calls (buy the shares at strike price). You can also sell your contracts to make money on expectations (15C are worth 4.50 even tough BB is not at 19.50).",addicteded,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ns6fwq/bb_are_you_guys_coming_to_get_me/h0kw4x6/,0.056,0.832,0.111,0.8924

Yes, the web browser was locked down and proxied through the company BES, but the keyboard beat the hell out of the Motorola RAZR I had as a personal phone. As soon as my contract was up, I traded the RAZR in for a BB Curve 8830 (which I STILL have, I just don't have a battery for it).   


A few years back, when they released the PRIV, I bought one. Great little phone, but the BlackBerry Hub software tended to drag the rest of Android down with it, and the battery life was shit as a result.

Looks like the short % of float is bit bigger than Jan although that doesn’t really matter. What I found interesting is that alpha trading signals trigger came off today and it was the RSI 90-100 and that also came off back in jan (23rd I think?). The volume yesterday was higher than any day in Jan (I think). Combined with RSI trigger coming off yesterday as well this all looks super super bullish.

If you want to buy that contract back for whatever reason you can ""buy to close"" and re-buy back the contract.

1182,AMC," No.....

The expiration is today so that means as the expiration approaches,  the price of the call starts to rapidly fall to zero. It doesn’t even gradually fall because it’s not linear. The “speed,” of the fall to zero accelerates rapidly. If the stock dips just a little, the fall to zero quickens. If the stock blips up the call will still lose value because the expiration is today and the contract is far out of the money. 

The only thing I can imagine someone doing this is if they sold to open 173k calls, (they wrote and sold the call options to someone) and so they bought the calls to close and take profit because they will be having testicle reduction surgery today and don’t want to risk their shares being assigned and sold at 145 on the off chance that AMC goes to $300.",wiserone29,17,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nry4p8/somebody_bought_173000_amc_call_contracts_strike/h0jicb2/,0.031,0.898,0.071,0.6124
1183,GME," If the stock magically flies far above $145 you get the $$$.

That's how you saw people make $1k to $1+ million back in Jan from GME calls.

You buy calls so unrealistic that premiums themselves are near non-existent. In other words, you are paying almost nothing for all the profits of the 100 shares per contract if that 'unrealistic call' actually goes ITM.

1642,ANY," Disallow short selling for those stocks in general, or naked shorts on those stocks. Big difference in terms of how the stock price could sky rocket...

e.g
But 1,000 stocks during dip, wait until it goes up, sell 500 stocks and also sell 5 covered shorts, wait until goes down, buy more stocks at dip with profits and then do it again. Allowing shorts of ANY kind will still affect the market by allowing the potential for market manipulation for funds that have the massive purchasing power to do this.

1681,GME," I was under the impression that the driving force behind the squeeze was the fact that GME was shorted over 100% of float.  And the assumption being thrown around is that, despite what's being reported, GME remains over 250% shorted (being hid by some creative reporting).  

So if other institutions follow suit, wouldn't that mean that these short sellers would need to buy out their positions?  And wouldn't that mean that the demand for the stock would shoot up?  And since they need to buy out 250% of a stock that has less than 100% of its shares being floated, wouldn't that mean they CANNOT buy out of that position?  And wouldn't that mean that the price would go up indefinitely?

1692,AMC," >If I have to buy x of a stock, but I can only buy x-1 of the stock, doesn't the holder of that last 1 unit get to set a charge price as high as the moon?

Yes, but what happens when no one is allowed to speculatively borrow anymore shares in the future?  More short interest is generated by more overvaluation and high RSI indicators.

From the bank's perspective.. when the person they allowed to borrow can't cover the bank holds bag so if it becomes a trend these brokerages and banks can blacklist at their discretion because they have a responsibility to their depositors.. and when the bank is irresponsible and has to cover for a bankrupt investor FDIC has to print money to cover those deposits and bail out the bank.

So what happens when you have a stock you can no longer force anyone to buy at an overvalued price?  That is essentially the speculative trading pool they are trying to cut off.

As for AMC at this point.. 80% of the shares are owned by retail investors and there is only 13% short interest.  Doing the math, that 80% of retail investors will bid themselves down to be the first to cover that 13% of short interest.

As you say , the IB's will fight like hell to keep the price at 12.99. But when you talk about the apes, you're talking about an unregulated hedge fund with over 100 billion dollars in AUM. They own 20 billion dollars worth of Raisinets alone. The reason they're so successful with meme stocks is because there are only a couple of hedge funds in the world that could go to war with them on an individual equity and win, and none of those will do it.

As you say , the IB's will fight like hell to keep the price at 12.99. But when you talk about the apes, you're talking about an unregulated hedge fund with over 100 billion dollars in AUM. They own 20 billion dollars worth of Raisinets alone. The reason they're so successful with meme stocks is because there are only a couple of hedge funds in the world that could go to war with them on an individual equity and win, and none of those will do it.

Obviously I have a vested interest in seeing the price rise before my calls expire, but my 9/17s were bought on 5/10.  30 of my shares were bought in the first half of May. I quadrupled my position yesterday after someone else lit the fuse (a little too early, IMO).

If not for the gamma potential, my commentary would be better suited for /r/investing because the price is still barely off the floor and, in my opinion, less than 50% of where it should/will be.

1832,AMC," well where do I begin. sorry I don't wanna be patronising in any way, its just a lot and I don't have much time.

1. shorts do not have to cover. I might get downvoted for this, because many ppl here (want to) believe that, but there is simply no law or rule or contract that says shortsellers have to cover. the may decide to cover if they fear their losses might rise or the interest they have to pay on borrowed shares becomes too expensive. in many ways, shorting is the exact opposite as holding shares. if you hold shares, nobody can force you to sell. you may decide to hold your red position for ages until it becomes green again. if you short sell, you may do the same (and pay interest; but if that interest is like 0.1%, who cares)
2. AMC can (and did) issue new shares. company value stays the same, but share float rises. its called dilution and usually bad for investors (bc all of a sudden you own less of the same company). in 99% of cases though, when you buy a share, you dont buy it from the company, you buy it from a random stock holder who sold it in the same second).

bottom line is, its simply impossible to predict when shortsellers cover. the amount of shares the company can still issue (46k in this case) is basically irrelevant in that regard.",jp_taxguy,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nrxupf/amc_and_bb_both_have_potential_research_and_put/h0l1rdn/,0.072,0.783,0.145,0.9625

1834,AMC," Right, so I understand both of these points. I guess I'm confused by the logistics of it. AMC has stated that after yesterday, it won't be issuing new shares until 2022. With retailers owning 80% of the votes, that seems to ring true. But I guess I'm still trying to understand the who synthetic/borrowed shares thing. If there shares do not exist, then the HF are losing money as we all HODL. And I guess I understand that shorts do not have to cover but it's probably ideal for them to eventually. 

When/if they do, and in this scenario everyone else is HODL, are their only option to buy back in the remaining 46k shares that AMC has? That's all I'm trying to understand.

However, using natural gas as a fuel releases CO2 and therefore still adds greenhouse gas to the atmosphere, even if the source of the natural gas is a waste byproduct. Yes the RNG prevents CH4 from entering the atmosphere, but if it's used as a fuel I dont understand how that process could be carbon negative or even carbon neutral.

2128,RNG," Except that it’s not. You don’t need to call it green hydrogen, it’s just hydrogen. 

Electrification has its use cases, 100%. Commuter vehicles and last mile deliveries, possibly public transport depending on location but that’s about where that ends. It also conveniently ignores the fact that electrified vehicles are also inherently dirty due to manufacturing, waste, actually charging them (which is still done by fossils.) 

Hydrogen, at best, is 10 years away. And that’s from it being a feasible technology to actually be used in transportation. What about infrastructure? Decades away from meeting scale. 

RNG is here now, and is the alternative to long haul transportation. especially when the only feasible alternative is diesel. Yes, more facilities need to be built out but the infrastructure and technology is already there on scale. 

The energy reallocation cannot be a one trick pony. Electrification will not solve every problem our transportation has. It will solve some, and RNG will fill in the gaps where electrifying is unfeasible. You can’t just slap thousands of lbs worth of batteries on long haulers and expect it to work, let alone be economical.

2132,NYC," I have as well, I actually took my drivers exam in a hydrogen Honda (insight? Can’t remember). 

You’re specifically referring to green hydrogen for a reason. I’m going out on a limb and guessing you’re stuck on that because a majority of hydrogen fuel today is manufactured as a byproduct of either refining natural gas or by manufacturing coal. 

Which is funny because if RNG is going to lead to its own extinction, then it sure doesn’t help hydrogen fuel by doing so as it directly produces hydrogen fuel as a byproduct. 

The green hydrogen you’re so stuck on that would be produced by solar+wind would require such an immense amount of both that I’m curious as to how you expect to achieve the fuels required for our transport industry, and at the same time power the entire electrical grid given that both technologies are geographically limited? 

Take solar. In NYC to install a run-of-the-mill solar setup on a townhome ranged anywhere from 80k-145k depending on the contractor. The panels would’ve lasted MAYBE 15 years given our lovely weather, and would’ve generated enough electricity to offset running a kitchen 2x a day for 3months of the year. 

Federal regulations are at what, 80,000lbs load limits for long haulers? Explain to me how adding at minimum 10,000lbs of batteries to these trucks is supposed to be the future of transportation? You want to cut down 1/8 the max capacity per vehicle to achieve some make believe electric trucking future? Where’s the missing capacity being made up? Who’s paying for it? 

You’re also conveniently ignoring the catch-22 that by trying to electrify the industry, you must increase the raw inputs to achieve it. I’m assuming strip mining battery components is a clean business now is it? Strip mining components for solar and turbines is clean as well, given how much more solar+wind would be needed to achieve hydrogen production that is truly “green”?

2173,RNG, Gennerally it costs 300% more to use RNG and it produces the same amount of emissions so not really solving an emissions issue. RNG has a limitation on how much gas you can get from Cow farts so it won't scale up. The carbon negative claim is so crazy that it doesn't make any physical or thermodynamics sense. Good luck with the bet but I doubt it is a game changer.,Great-Lychee,-3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nrq2i4/cow_farts_and_the_philosophers_stone_how_we/h0isq3o/,0.145,0.803,0.052,-0.7241
2174,RNG," In this case carbon negative is a bit of a misnomer. They're not carbon negative in the way most people think (ie sucking carbon out of the atmosphere like a tree or Aether Diamonds) but they are carbon dioxide equivalent negative. The greenhouse gases emitted through the use of renewable natural gas (RNG) are less than those emitted by the feedstock (methane) if it were left alone. 

Since different greenhouse gases have different warming potentials they are converted to carbon dioxide equivalents (1 metric ton of x = y metric tons of CO2) for the purposes of comparison. Methane (cow farts, manure, etc) has a CO2e of roughly 30. 

So when RNG is made from methane some of it goes into making trucks go vroom and some goes into the atmosphere as CO2 (not as potent as methane). When you leave the cow shit alone, it sits there happily producing methane and roasting us to death. 

The big potential for RNG is not in reducing emissions (which it does do) but in waste management. It literally turns shit into cash. 

It is also a bitch to remove methane from the atmosphere so it's better if there are any emissions, they are CO2 rather than methane. Atmospheric methane's only real sink is bacteria in the soil (most commonly found in forest floors). There are machines that can scrub CO2 from the atmosphere and turn it into diamonds. All we got for methane is a bunch of trees close together. 

So go invest in RNG and 💎✊ some 🌳🌲🌳.

2380,GME, I don't think it is a conspiracy. I think it is evolution. The idea behind pushing GME was to hurt hedge funds and benefit other retailer investors. WSB is moving towards other stocks trying to short squeeze investors. This is not about a specific stock. It is about bringing down companies that manipulate the market for their own gain. More importantly it is about individuals moving together for the benefit of us all. Apes stong together. The individual stock is irrelevant.

Doesn’t matter how many shares you buy it only matters how much % return is... that’s like saying 4 bricks at a total of 100lbs weighs more than 100 pieces of paper at 100lbs....1/4 brick is 25% of 4 total bricks. just like 25 out of 100 is 25% of the paper....25/100 = 1/4 which = 25%....Holy cow that’s some amazing shit right right? Here’s what AMC and BB have, A LARGE FLOAT. If GME had 700 million in volume like AMC did at 70, it would be well over $2000 a share. This is because there are only 50 million shares available for the market to buy! AMC has 450 million...For example, If Chad buys $10k of Gme at $250 and it went to 1k you would make $7500 profit. if Chad buys $10,000 worth of AMC at $25 a share and it went to 100 how much would Chad profit? Anyone???  The reason why AMC/BB held strong is because large floats are harder to push down/up.

If GME went bankrupt that would have had zero effect on Netflix and a virtually undetectable effect on Amazon, which benefits when any retailer goes out of business. They didn’t target GME because they saw it as a threat, they targeted it for exactly opposite reason— it appeared last year to be a literal joke of a company whose customers hated it and wouldn’t have batted an eye at its bankruptcy if it hadn’t been for the tendie train. 

Let’s not pretend this is somehow a story about how the wholesome and long-beloved GameStop came under fire and apes rushed to its aid out of brand loyalty— this is a cash-grab for most, who have probably never set foot in a GameStop and don’t give a fuk about NFTs or whatever. If the same situation had happened with Hardee’s or EA Games, people would be bandwagoning behind them too and talking about how mean it is for hedgies to short, even though nobody really likes these companies.

That is because they would have to buy all the shares and take on the debt, but would then get the cash from the balance sheet, after buying the company.

Now in reality, they would have to pay a premium to the current share price to get shareholders to sign off on the purchase, but it's a good starting point to see the entire worth of a company.

IF AMC was $5/share, it's market cap would be around $2b +$1.1b in debt - $800m in cash= $2.3b EV.  CNK EV is currently at $6.13b.  Given that AMC is the largest publicly traded in the sector, with double the amount of theatres worldwide of CNK, let's just say AMC EV should be double CNK (fundamentals, right?).  So if the EV SHOULD be $12.26b, the reverse math would be $12.23b EV - $800m cash + $1.1b debt= $12.53b market cap.  That is 6X the $2b amount above, meaning the actual share price SHOULD be 6X $5= $30 / share.

2683,AMC," really? If youre serious market cap is total shares x share price. Giving you the total value of the company. 

So all your maths are wrong, or... theyre calculating the wrong thing anyway. You can just look at market cap and see that AMC's valuation is way way way ridiculously too high compared to simular companies.

2685,AMC," I'm seeing one main number that is differing a lot for me. I'm seeing AMC with $5.4B in debt, the same $800M in cash, so I get an EV of $6.6B at $5/share vs the $6.1B for CNK. Also you didn't actually reverse the math. From the $12.3B, we need to subtract the $5.4B, but add $800M, so $7.7B for theoretical market cap of where AMC should trade, which would be closer to 4x the $2B. That would mean by your statement of AMC should be worth about double CNK, it would give a price target of $20, still a far cry from that guy's $0.01 price target.

I will add a caveat that I'd have to check all the above numbers versus the SEC filings. I was just looking at Seeking Alpha for my data, so please excuse me if any of it is incorrect. It also adds an extra layer of complexity that AMC just sold at least 20M shares, but has raised over $1B this quarter (I think it means they have certainly sold more than the 20M shares sold recently). This is still good for the overall math of AMC being worth more than $20/share, because they sold shares for more than that, or at least all the ones sold in the last week were.

In the end, I think that analyst has a $0.01 price target for shock value. I'm sure he wouldn't put any money down on them hitting $0.01 within a year, even if he does think they'll eventually go bankrupt somewhere several/many years from now. One thing is definitely true from all this though- it bought AMC a lot of time to try to change around their business to a format that works again.

2874,BB," I’ve decided to go full BB and PLTR ape this month. BB is no where NEAR done. It’s just getting start. 

PLTR got amazing news as well. Invested $230 million in Babylons Health SPAC merger to go public. A great long term partnership will begin. Great things are going to come out of that. They are investing in billionaire tech company’s like Google and Intel. The CEO knows what the future holds for the company.

This month is going to be fun you apes. 👐💎 

Don’t let today get to you that much. We have the weekend now. Let’s all get high, have a drink, have happy thoughts, and be prepared for anything on Monday. 👐💎

Cheers. 🍸🍻

EDIT: Anyone curious on my PLTR and BB postions, for PLTR, I decided to switch my TSLA calls to PLTR and I averaged my calls WAY down. I have 27$ calls that were .34, now .21, and I have 35$ 6-25 calls that were .31, now .17 

I honestly think that was a good thing to do and I am looking forward to Monday. 

For BB, I got insanely lucky with 6-18 43$ calls at .14 a piece and they are worth .66 at 13.68 share price before close. My BB calls have gone parabolic, but I’m holding. I have faith. We have BB earnings on the 23rd THIS month, and I read up that the actually did well.

2937,CLNE," scalped 10% on an overnight options play when the volatility blew up.

price deflated today, made it possible to get back in. 

Now:

PMCC:  5C (Jan 22) and 10C (7/16).

As an energy stock it's isolated from all the international crude fuckery and big oil drama - for which I have an XLE position to take in the ass thank you very much.

RNG is pretty much the only viable green energy source for certain sectors like industrial and logistics. I don't see hydrogen ever takes off given all the technical and infrastructure challenges. Batteries are fine for consumer vehicles but not this. Plus the vast majority of world battery production will go to all the electric cars anyways.

2947,CLNE," The hysteria aside, this company actually has a bright future, and definitely not a meme stock.

EV for delivery vehicles is just not feasible right now.

A fleet of trucks can NOT sit there for hours to recharge, and having to spend the juice to haul the HEAVY BATTERY PACKS, on top of the cargo.  

Hydrogen doesn’t have the infrastructure.  CLNE made the smart decision to build filling stations RIGHT NEXT to Amazon warehouses.  

Also, it’s much easier AND cheaper to adopt current gas engines to run natural gas...can’t say that about hydrogen nor ev.

Whether you are in it for short term swing or long term hold...it’s hard to go wrong...especially at this pps.
