0,DD, You did the entire DD on DraftKings without even touching the Daily Fantasy Sports side of their business? A side that generates a ton in rake daily? And a side that completely has the market dominated with FanDuel being the only real competition in the space?

3,DD, GMBL is far superior. Literally has tons of DD to read and watch. Cramer also mentioned it Friday.,yeahsureig,2,/r/RobinHood/comments/n8el75/draftkings_dkng_due_diligence_the_king_of_online/gxipjih/,0.0,0.829,0.171,0.5423

6,ID," They are assholes tho. I had some stock, downloaded the app.. decided to use said app for UFC fights, won 3x my money then they wouldn't let me withdraw from where they took my deposit (Chime) then wouldn't accept Suntrust, then I added $5 from my PayPal to be able to withdraw my winnings and then they lock my account for verification (all areas have same email which is my name and some numbers) so I uploaded my ID then told them I live off the grid and they ban me for life and THEN initiated the withdrawal to PayPal THEN cancelled that making me verify an address for a check... which I did bc I got it like that...but fuck them in the ear with their ancestors rotten bones.
I'll be shorting their stock from now on....and then use FanDuel to bet on Ufc fights.",cannabis_jedi,-11,/r/RobinHood/comments/n8el75/draftkings_dkng_due_diligence_the_king_of_online/gxi9iyz/,0.147,0.786,0.067,-0.9183
7,DKNG, Cut my losses on riot and putting that money into DKNG to average down. Hopefully it keeps falling to the 40s.,NumberOneClark,1,/r/RobinHood/comments/n8el75/draftkings_dkng_due_diligence_the_king_of_online/gxia8uu/,0.348,0.557,0.094,-0.743
8,DKNG," “Super Bowl is a potential catalyst.” “March Madness is a potential catalyst.” “The Masters is a potential catalyst.” 

Now this one? So, all DKNG has managed to do during that time is drop week over week, month over month. Maybe overvaluing a company by a sales multiple with high customer acquisition costs and legislative headwinds seems too much of a risky bet considering that interest rate hikes are around the corner.",upsidevalue,1,/r/RobinHood/comments/n8el75/draftkings_dkng_due_diligence_the_king_of_online/gxjez2b/,0.096,0.862,0.042,-0.4215
