0,DD," I had some shares of this before the recent run up -- Sold on the $7 pop AH.

No position now, but here's some DD I found while I was in it:

They make eye needles. Spooky, but apparently necessary for delivering certain types of medicine. They had some negative clinical data come out recently which caused the big fall off. Also caused a lot of analysts to drop PTs, but ofc analysts dropping PTs doesn't instantly mean something is a bad play.

They don't have a ton of cash on hand, but they're also very low debt so I *feel* like you shouldn't be at too much risk for an offering.",RadioRedMages,34,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/nznre4/very_undervalued_stock_gray_it_was_2035_before/h1qkepm/,0.178,0.706,0.116,-0.8458

5,COCP," Basically some companies are getting pumped either the week/day of an offering which dilutes (adds) shares and makes your shares worth less. Then after said pump, the market will short the thing to the ground. Check out COCP for an example. Ran to $2-3 and then the offering shot it down to the 1.10s. It can be a momentum play but when something smells fishy, it‚Äôs best to get out same day.",Op-Toe-Mus-Rim-Dong,2,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/nznre4/very_undervalued_stock_gray_it_was_2035_before/h1r46ff/,0.0,0.845,0.155,0.8793
6,OR," For T1d, the question is not ‚Äúwho is‚Äù using CGM rather the question is ‚Äúwho isn‚Äôt‚Äú. That narrows it down to areas where, say dexcom is largely unavailable (Looking at you South Korea) OR to people that can‚Äôt afford a dexcom.

Even then, Abbot has their Libre CGM, though it‚Äôs not actually continuous in the same sense because the sensor has to be manually scanned for readings. 

SENS will eventually be a game changer in the cgm space but they have some time to go.

8,SNDL, I bought .50 calls a few weeks before it ran up past 1$. Sold at the peak for a 75% return and now I'm in place to buy back those .50 calls again and hopefully repeat. SNDL can make you money if you have patience and make the right moves and not get too greedy. I wanted to let my calls run longer thinking I'll get more money but Took my gains and watched SNDL fall right after I sold.,Spunknikk,5,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/nza99a/sndl_technicals_not_looking_too/h1pg7me/,0.0,0.918,0.082,0.6631
9,SNDL, I was selling some calls since I own quite a bit. But there‚Äôs not much money in selling SNDL calls unless there‚Äôs a lot of volume.

10,RSI," Stock could go either way, may dip to 0.85 or up to 1.20. Depends on which time frame you look at and all the other million reasons a stock could move.
