2,NIM," Everyone here is misunderstanding what happened, afaict. 

A bank is supposed to buy short and lend long, because short term money costs little while long term money costs more, usually. So they buy money from depositors for some low rate and sell it as mortgages or whatever at much longer durations for higher rates. The difference is their profit: net interest margin or NIM.

In these cases, these banks were holding long term money, so they in effect were buying long AND lending long. I mean the more I think about it the stupider it gets. You take in depositor money at 1% or something, and then you buy a 30 year bond that's yielding not much more than that? And if you know anything about the bond market you know the long end is far more volatile, price-wise, than the short end.

Where was their common sense? Where were their risk managers? Who does this stupid stuff and expects to not get shafted?",BentonD_Struckcheon,1,/r/investing/comments/125miyn/as_interest_rates_rose_banks_did_a_balancesheet/je6vlmq/,0.089,0.877,0.034,-0.8611
3,IMO," I don't think that's true. Sure, if they can continue paying low rates to depositors they can make a profit despite holding low rate bonds, but that's actually because depositor stickiness is an asset. When rates rose, their bonds lost value, and the asset of having depositors who don't seek competitive rates gained value, and these cancelled out to some extent. But depositors can leave, so IMO banks should be regulated to have sellable assets that are actually worth more than their deposits.",pithecium,1,/r/investing/comments/125miyn/as_interest_rates_rose_banks_did_a_balancesheet/je66xjr/,0.13,0.635,0.235,0.9154

Fellow CPA here, it's more than just management's flip flopping from AFS to HTM at a whim.  If they are doing it due to existing liquidity issue, or material changes in interest rate, etc. then the reclassification would be difficult to do under the currently accounting guidance (ASC 320).

How do you know?  We now have the benefit of hindsight, these bank runs are next to impossible to stop and wildly unpredictable.

But if you're a CPA, you'd know that fair value measure of financial assets have a HUGE disclosure requirement for a reason... and it's because the accounting get scrutinized by regulators when shit hits the fan.

Btw, I'd bet that the only reason why the big banks can reclassify AFS to HTM now is with the backing of the deposits in full.  Otherwise, they wouldn't have a snowball's chance in Hell in convincing their auditors to sign off.

17,CSX," INRG - change of assets from solar to rail??

Hi guys! I'm new here, let me know if there's anything up with this post ✌️
I've held iShares ii global clean energy (INRG) for a couple of years now. I bought it as a pure play on my confidence in the growth of renewable energy in the next couple of decades. When I bought the fund, I had a look at the top 10 underlying assets, and they were very much renewable energy related (can't find the specific companies, but I checked them out at the time and they were solar, wind and tidal related). 
This morning, I checked the top 10 underlying assets again. They're now:
1. Nextera Energy (energy)
2. Union pacific (trains)
3. American tower corp (wireless comms)
4. Enbridge (oil and gas pipelines)
5. Duke Energy (energy)
6. The Southern company (energy)
7. Canadian pacific railway (trains)
8. Canadian national railway (trains)
9. CSX (trains)
10.Crown castle (communications)

Can anyone explain what's happened? How can a fund that's ostensibly to do with clean energy have such big holdings in companies only distantly related to renewable energy (in Enbridge's case directly competing with it?).
And what's with the rail obsession? When did these changes happen, how can I find out?

Appreciate any info that anyone might have about this, cheers folks.😎

HR will be the same way sure EA has its own HR team and several HR employees after the merger they will still be there,  maybe 1-2 management jobs can be cut.

What profit would gmail make as a stand alone? Do we have any private company out there that is just email?
I don’t know details on the companies books but I can only imagine that in big tech you have divisions that make big profits and other that operate at a loss which help to offset those gains. Splitting them up would probably cause some to fail in the end. 
Also BABA is down 50% over the past 5 years.

50,CS," I know it sounds like shit, but picking up a single stock then holding it for a longer time requires excessive knowledge on relevant topics as well as a well-built strategy. It could be ending up with an unrecoverable loss that retail guys can't afford if you were too confident on your capability of capturing ""alpha"".

Seems you believe there is a high likelihood that a bank stock will outperform and reward you excessive return in the long run, as long as you can identify which bank stock will do so. Yet you still underestimate the underlying risks going forward: financial stability, monetary polices (mainly domestic but also include foreign ones), interest rate (both short and long), industrial changes, etc...any negative impact from these will result in a depreciation of stock price that destroy your holdings.

Think about this: let's turn back the clock to 2020/2021, can you tell us, among SVB, CS, Signature Bank and First Republic, which one will be the long term winner? The fact is no matter how smart you are you will be punished in two years if you picked any one of the four.
