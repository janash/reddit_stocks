64,MSCI," I have found that the individual stocks and the sector specific ETFs in this area have been wildly volatile and have been on a down slide since being overvalued. 

I changed my approach to screen from a broader ETF/mutual fund group for those funds that select the best ESG stocks. I use the MSCI ESG rating and the fossil free funds screener to find potential funds. When I narrowed it down, I compared the funds to each other and to various index funds at the mutual fund comparison tool at market watch to find the best performing socially and environmentally aligned fund. Some funds require minimum investments and some brokers all dollar investments into those that otherwise require a minimum. Long story short, I put money every two weeks into PRBLX.

65,BP," I work in renewable energy and have reasonable insight on what companies are setting themselves up for success. I'm mainly in the offshore wind space. Here's a few suggestions I have invested in myself:

Clearway Energy; the yieldco, not the developer. I recommend you look at including a few yieldco in general, these are essentially the operating vehicles of completed power generation infrastructure. In simple terms, the wind or solar farm has been built (=derisked!) and is operating, generating a return. You buy these for the dividend returns, not necessarily growth. 

Siemens Energy; big player in renewable generation, but also in smart grids, storage - all very important to make the transition into renewables work.

NextEra Energy; solid pipeline of renewable projects, set up for growth. 

Orsted; as above; developer. The dominant force in offshore wind for years to come

Aker Offshore Wind; bit of a bet. They have set themselves up for dominance in floating offshore wind. I'm a firm believer, but it's fair to say this is a riskier bet

BP; a controversial one, I know. But big oil money is needed to accelerate the renewables transition and they are going to change the playing field. BP is making the right moves, but yes, you're still putting your money into big oil for the time being... Also good dividend return.

These are just stock picks; but there are good funds as well.

105,IMO, Anyone listen to Cathie Wood’s recent market commentary? I think she makes a very strong buy the dip case for tech growth right now. Basically she argues that inflation is temporary currently and that a lot of her investments will be sources of deflation in the future that will keep long term interest rates in check. She argues that commodity prices are spiking currently because companies are over ordering to try to keep up with spikes in sudden post pandemic demand and she feels that there will be a blow off and correction in commodity prices in the future. She thinks that the only real risk of inflation is actually the dollar collapsing relative to other currencies and if that happens she will revisit her view of it. Her conclusion is that there is no reason to be concerned about a continuing bull market. IMO not sure why she gets hate as she is clearly an intelligent economist. Her views are very inline with the fed itself.,reactbooter,3,/r/investing/comments/ncuj1v/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/gy92ixb/,0.103,0.815,0.081,-0.2427

107,AMT," Standard disclaimer-I'm not a tax person.  Seek your own professional advisor and don't trust random people on the internet.

That out of the way, there is the potential that AMT may need to be payed when you exercise ISO shares.  My understanding is that ISO shares can also receive preferential tax treatment under certain conditions.  (Mostly involving how long since grant date and how long the shares are held post-exercise.) I suggest figuring out that info and doing the math based on your own personal situation. (AMTs also generally have different rules for tax deductions.  They certainly have their own rates and brackets.)

Seems to me that there's an advantage to waiting and seeing when it comes to ISOs though.  Unless you're in a rush to cash out, you can sit on your options (I'm assuming they're not near expiration) and wait for either IPO or acquisition, then look at the value then.  Nothing guarantees that funding rounds or IPO will make the price go up, after all.  As it stands, the option is at-the-money, meaning there's no real advantage to exercising now.

Assuming the price does go up, you are pretty much going to have to pay capital gains taxes anyway.  AMT or no AMT, Uncle Sam is gonna get his cut of the profits.  I strongly suggest you look up capital gains taxes alongside AMT.  (I wouldn't forget state taxes either.)  Also, in theory, AMT can come back to you in later years.

TLDR: Figure out Short Term vs Long Term capital gains tax.  Then figure out how AMT interacts with them.  After that, think real hard about where you think the price will go and about how certain you are.",sporkified,2,/r/investing/comments/ncqhmm/iso_or_nso_exercise_help_me_maths/gy726c4/,0.039,0.833,0.128,0.9725
108,AMT," I am able to see the company financials, so know our valuation will go up based on our revenue growth, like more than 2x based on last years performance. It's my understanding the ISOs have no AMT because the exercise and FMV are the same. But they cost more than the NSO's. So yeah Im confused as heck.",TheRaiderettes,1,/r/investing/comments/ncqhmm/iso_or_nso_exercise_help_me_maths/gy7x2ls/,0.078,0.816,0.107,0.2129
109,AMT," All of this is to the best of my knowledge: Your ISOs would presently have no AMT.  Your NSO would be taxed at short term cap gains rates on the delta between strike price and estimated fair market value at point of exercise.  

AMT tax is essentially a way that government prevents too much tax advantaged behavior.  Every year, each taxpayer calculates their AMT tax burden and their regular tax burden.  AMT uses different brackets, but also has a massively higher exemption.  The thing is- if a person falls into AMT tax range one year, the difference between AMT tax (Which was paid) and the regular tax is saved indefinitely as AMT carry forward tax credit.  In subsequent tax years, if the AMT tax rate is less than regular tax rate, you'd pay the higher of the two, (in this case regular tax) but you would be able to apply the AMT carry forward tax credit to your payment, up to the delta between AMT and regular that year.  Put simply, extra money paid in AMT may come back to you later.

There's a bunch of other details involving the cost basis of your shares when paying capital gains-all future AMT calculations use a cost basis of the fair market value at point of exercise whereas regular tax computes the capital gains from the actual strike price.

You'll also want to understand the ISO rules for Long Term Capital gains, as they're slightly different than for normal shares.  (I don't have enough personal experience with NSOs to know if they are different as well.  They very well may be.)

Overall, I would suggest that you do as I did-spend a day researching AMT, then building a spreadsheet that computes your income, how normal tax rates and AMT rates would affect both your income and any exercised ISOs and NSOs under different FMV conditions, and make decisions from there.

My guess will be that you'd find that, should the share price hit $20, assuming you are trying to get Long Term Capital Gains rates, it is more advantageous to exercise your NSOs sooner than later.  If you didn't exercise your ISOs, you'd start worrying about AMT, though there's a significant chance whatever overage you paid in AMT would come back to you in later years. (Unless you are one of those who expect to be paying AMT tax rates for the rest of their lives...that's a different matter altogether.) 

I'm assuming here that you also understand that there are risks that share price may drop and that it isn't risk free money.  

I'll also re-emphasize that everything I've posted is to the best of my knowledge, but that I may well be missing important details or misunderstanding key information.  This is why I suggest you independently confirm everything I've written about.",sporkified,2,/r/investing/comments/ncqhmm/iso_or_nso_exercise_help_me_maths/gy8aydo/,0.055,0.798,0.147,0.9924
