0,CTXR, Been high on CTXR for months now and that makes me feel even better..thanks man,flames251,24,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/noav1q/ctxr_a_brief_summary_about_a_biopharmaceutical_gem/gzz2jmm/,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
1,CTXR, CTXR is a winner. I have most of my money in it. Holding long term,ThatMattGuy74,16,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/noav1q/ctxr_a_brief_summary_about_a_biopharmaceutical_gem/gzz0sob/,0.0,0.759,0.241,0.5859
2,CTXR," ""Cash until 2023, dilution is not a concern. All the future trials are competely funded until 2023. The chairman said that they don't want to do further dilutions. No debt.""  


Then why has he asked shareholders to vote to double their authorised shares at the next AGM?  


""- Still a extremely low market cap of 300m Given the fact that a market of 1.5b (only in america, global market is much higher) is reachable without competition is outstanding (only talking about Mino-Lok here).""  


Their own investor presentation (slide 3) states that the market for MinoLok is >$1.8B WORLDWIDE. The Hemorrhoid treatment is estimated at $2b worldwide (Halo Lido) however that wont be commercialised far beyond 2023 and will require more dilution to fund (assuming they're approved).  


I could pick further holes but I've argued this so many times. The CTXR cult is too strong. Why on Earth you think there'll be no further dilution when they're trying to double their A/S is beyond me.",Allstar9393,9,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/noav1q/ctxr_a_brief_summary_about_a_biopharmaceutical_gem/gzz5xfw/,0.074,0.891,0.035,-0.545
3,ZOM," Got out with profits on this a few weeks back.  This feels like ZOM and priced in.  Could be wrong, but people are trying to pump this one hard the past week.

4,IMO, Great post ! Iâ€™m in at 207 @ $1.93 been watching this stock for months. Itâ€™s been at the $2.30 resistance and looking to break out IMO. Soon to be on the Russel 2000 .

5,CTXR," Good eye, thank your for noticing that. I edited the post and the wrong number. Mistake on my end. 

Look at it this way: Why on earth would the Chairman do something bad to the company, he's bascially all in Citius. He stated multiple times that a dilution is not the plan. Look at his CV, he developed many companies only to sell them later, I think that is a possibility with CTXR. 

By 2023 they should get revenue (since FDA approval will only take 6 months), that means from there on they'll be able to fund their own RnD. Mino-Lok only has 3 ingredients which aren't necessarily expensive, they'll have high profit margins. From my point of view the Mino-Lok solution is only the basis for the stem cell therapy, that will be the end goal.",traderi,1,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/noav1q/ctxr_a_brief_summary_about_a_biopharmaceutical_gem/gzz6o9b/,0.062,0.836,0.103,0.6124
6,ZOM," I'm not trying to pump. ZOM had no real use case and was expensive for no added benefit. Mino-Lok saves lives, is cheaper and 100% save. Also, 95M are cash right now, so a third of our shares is cash.",traderi,1,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/noav1q/ctxr_a_brief_summary_about_a_biopharmaceutical_gem/gzzg01z/,0.094,0.726,0.179,0.6124
7,USA," That's unsurprising. They keep banging on about the ""worldwide"" market yet they haven't even begun trials outside of the USA. In fact, only one trial is past Phase 2 in the USA. Their product is very exciting, sure, but the delusion they express when thinking they'll suddenly be generating billions from it almost immediately is insane.",Allstar9393,3,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/noav1q/ctxr_a_brief_summary_about_a_biopharmaceutical_gem/gzz6qo9/,0.053,0.879,0.068,-0.0307
8,ZOM," That's why I think this is like the ZOM hype - but this is worse because there are trials to go through as well as approval and the start the of the supply chain process.  If anything this looks like a really long hold.  If you're getting into it.
