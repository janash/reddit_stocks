0,NIO," The fact that this charade went as long as it did is embarrassing. The fact that people who invested in Nikola actually thought they were investing in a legitimate company when countless reports and hints about them being a scam led by a con artist is laughable. The fact that they didn't even try to be original and tried to draw resemblance to Tesla with Nikola shows just how pathetic they are.

I have a friend who invested in Nikola and kept bragging about the Badger. Yeah, the rendering of the truck looks nice but anyone can draw a photo of something that looks nice. Watch interviews with Trevor Milton, the CEO of Nikola. This guy has absolutely zero clue what he is talking about other than some note cards to make it seem as if he understands the concepts. Yet people ignored it because they saw Tesla stock run rampant and thought Nikola would also duplicate that return. If people actually did some research, they would have realized very early on that Nikola is and was a scam. I mean, when you have to put your truck on a downhill to make it seem as if it is operational, you clearly are just duping investors. Thankfully, my friend sold when it was still in the mid 20's and now pushed his money into NIO/Tesla but man, I truly don't know what causes people to invest their hard-earned money on a company that has no revenue or an actual product. SEC should start thinking about adding restrictions because many of these new IPO's via SPACs are just get-rich quick schemes promising a product, getting pumped by media, and then duping retail investors.",Chromewave9,392,/r/investing/comments/ovlyl4/nikola_electric_truck_prototypes_were_powered_by/h7a8psx/,0.057,0.84,0.103,0.9136

16,IMO," \*ONLY\* for arguments sake, because it's clear NKLA was definitely more on the ""fraud"" side of the line.  There was a time when Tesla was hobbling together cars that were spending more time in the shop than on the road.

They were making absolutely insane timeline predictions that they had almost no chance of meeting, i.e. ""Tesla time"".  They couldn't really access capital markets for debt, they pushed like crazy to sell/deliver cars before the end of the quarter so their numbers would look good.

29,GM," imo it feels like GM is really resentful that investors don't give their EV ambitions the same respect they do Tesla and other EV startups. Even a lot of the GM analysts often seem resentful that few investors respect what GM is doing in the EV space, especially whenever they go on financial media shows to talk about GM. Some analysts have even gone as far as releasing price targets for how much GM should be valued if you value their EV segment under the same valuation standards Tesla is valued with by the market.

It felt very blatant to me at the time that GM was hoping to get investors to finally respect their EV tech and ambitions by leeching off of Nikola's hype.

His statements about the viability of their FSD platform and their ""Paint it black"" video grossly misrepresented the state and ability of their system years ago too.  It's pretty common for Musk to pull specs out of his ass too for products as well and then alter them down the line.

33,GM," I don't see it remotely as comparable and I know you are trying to play devil's advocate but there are several glaring differences.

1. Tesla had already sold a working, physical EV before they went public. This wasn't some fluke vehicle just for advertising purposes.
2. Musk had been a part of several successful companies and also had some success with SpaceX early on. He wasn't just some shmuck. The guy genuinely knew his stuff.

That whole Intel event was for a single purpose.. damage control for AMD’s earnings that were being released that night.

In those earnings Intel lost more server market share to AMD.. much more. To the point that Intel thought that the best way to manage the loss in server market share was to admit that they were behind and that it would take until 2025 at the earliest (if at all possible) for Intel to get the lead back. 

There was no rosy message there.  Intel is on fire, they covered it up with some celebrations, some new business venture ideas that haven’t worked in the past (with no signed clients) but the core message is that Intel is burning and they will be burning for the next 4 years.

I have started investing about approximately 1 month ago, and have picked out these stocks and crypto as long term positions. I would be listing out the main reasons on why I have purchased these stocks and crypto, and would like to get some opinions on my current portfolio.

50% Stocks

Apple (AAPL) 8%: Apple products are widely used, many loyalists to its product. Still has room for growth and do not see it dying anytime soon. Picked as tech blue chip.

AMD 14%: Bullish on semiconductors in the long term, picked both AMD and NVDA as forerunners in the industry. Picked for growth potential.

Microsoft (MSFT) 3%: Similar to AAPL, both companies are huge and have a large customer base, with further room for growth. Picked as second tech blue chip.

Nvidia (NVDA) 5%: Similar to AMD, hard to pick between both companies, and thus have chosen both. Picked for growth potential.

SEA LTD (SE) 11%: SEA LTD has 3 subsidiaries, Shopee (e-Commerce), GArena (Gaming) and SEA Money (Digital Payment). A long term pick in which I believe has a chance of being a multi-bagger and that its growth potential has not peaked yet.

Tesla (TSLA) 9%: Futuristic EV company, a favorite pick of certain investors. Similar reasoning to SE, with a certain amount of risk tied to it.

20% Cryptocurrency

Ethereum (ETH) 16% 

Chainlink (LINK) 4%

Purchased mainly to gain some exposure to cryptocurrency. Currently viewed as a commodity, in which I believe ETH and LINK has high growth potentials to it.

30% Cash: Currently untouched and waiting to be used to buy any potential dips or add positions in other sectors, as I am very exposed to tech-related movements. Will gain about 1% every month from salary, which can then be used to purchase more stocks.

Currently red on SE, AAPL and MSFT as most of my positions are new and would be looking to average down on these depending on market conditions. Also looking to diversify out of tech with stocks such as Disney (DIS) and Thermo Fisher (TMO). Not adding more funds into crypto, as I feel 20% is already a high ratio.

98,PT," Your 401k money will require RMDs once you retire. And all Standard IRA and Standard 401k money is considered earned income for tax and Social Security (SS) benefits. Therefore, if your earned income goes over a certain level because you took a PT job or your 401k amount is so large, a larger portion of your SS benefit becomes taxable. 

Whereas Roth IRA withdrawals are NOT classified as 'earned' income and DO NOT affect SS benefits.

Two more caveats. If you have a Roth 401k account, there are two things you need to know. First is that when you retire,  you must take a RMD from the Roth. After it is removed, transfer the Roth 401k money into a previously established (at least for 5 years) Roth account. You will then have no more RMDs from that money.

Also, the Employer contribution matching your 401k Roth contribution is currently, by law, required to go into the Standard 401k account bucket.

100,POWW," I have a good pick if you can get in now and cash out in the next 2 weeks.
Stock name POWW
Company name Ammo
On the 13 they have a quarterly report after hours.
Stock should be up above $10 a share.
It’s $6.83 right now.
There’s an ammunition shortage in the US right now and people are buying guns at record pace.
So it’s a no brainer that the quarterly earnings report will be positive.
Last quarterly brought the stock up $2.75 when I cashed out and went up from there.
Not a stock to hold on to.
Just one to make some quick money on.
It will go back to $6.50-$7.50 
Two days after quarterly so it is a stock that is worth cashing out then buying back on the dip but it’s going up this week.
I’m halfway bought in waiting for a dip this week.
Monday in the first hour it should dip so if you want to get paid quickly then it’s a low stress pick",Feisty-Juan,1,/r/investing/comments/ovotx9/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/h7crppq/,0.056,0.89,0.054,-0.3493
