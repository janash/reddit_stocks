Its a cheap lottery ticket right now at $.07. Maybe options activity picks up and that option increases in value, but I doubt it will finish ITM as rig would have to gain over $1 in a few weeks.

Open interest is pretty low, but it's cheap. Hope that helps and sorry to whoever asked that I'm not able to respond directly.",Itsboomhomie,1,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/ogjbp7/penny_stock_unusual_options_volume_78/h4lnx03/,0.107,0.66,0.233,0.948
