272,DD," IVR listed as a top topic on RH- please help.

Can someone explain the run up in IVR today itâ€™s ripping upward.

Either Iâ€™m missing something or retail is getting on it. I own it but Iâ€™m a bit confused. Please help with some great DD. Sorry for the distraction just need a little help please. Thanks guys!

I am seeing the upward trend but itâ€™s spike up today and the volume is astronomical. They issued more share but the dividend is 10% and management says it safe. If this is trying to meme stock, I guess I get it but really need confirmation because Iâ€™m pretty exposed here.
Take a look if you have time and Iâ€™m not saying buy it I just donâ€™t see the catalyst for todayâ€™s massive move. I like the stock but damn I really want to figure it out.",Various-Breath2517,1,/r/RobinHood/comments/nvs323/daily_discussion_thread_june_9th_2021/h16iwmc/,0.084,0.662,0.254,0.9841
