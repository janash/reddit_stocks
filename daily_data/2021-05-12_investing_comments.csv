1,FSLY," Great work. I don't entirely agree with your methodology, but I very much appreciate the data and analysis. To compare ARKK's performance to VGT is somewhat disingenuous. VGT is one of the best performing ETFs (and investments in general) in recent history with a 5 year CAGR is 30.75%, compared to 17.68% on VTI. Thats 282% in cumulative returns compared to 125% on VTI. In addition, simply beating or losing by a year doesn't mean much when the 5 year CAGR of ARKK is at 46.24% even after the massive sell off since February. Despite 'losing' more battles, ARKK is clearly outperforming VGT for buy and hold investors. I will concede that finding a fair comparable to ARKK is hard, and only recently are there good comps (ie. QQQJ and MOON), but they don't really have enough history to make for any meaningful analysis. 

Granted, I would also go as far as to say that she almost certainly is underperforming the sector and comparables in 2021 YTD. There are a number of very erratic moves that don't make much sense, like buying FSLY before earnings and selling it a week later when it tanks.",shimszy,30,/r/investing/comments/nabnrv/cathie_wood_deep_dive_into_her_20_year/gxsyz2y/,0.049,0.772,0.178,0.9816

4,SP," I am familar with these momentum stock fund managers. There has been several amazing fund managers delivered great return for a year or two but could not sustain long.  One named Kevin got booted out during the dot com was delivering +60-80% is still around. It tanked about -70% when dot com hit same type of performance as her 1980-1981.  Last year same fund manager Kevin delivered +20%. Prior years not attractive.  At any rate, she will be *66 years old this year end*. She or her daughter can hang around or advise people her vintage.

Gerald Tsai Jr who helped to build first *momentum stock* into mf with Fidelity is the original veteran. He did very well until his Manhatten fund tanked 90%.  Not hinting ARK will end up that way.   If Woods closes some of her etfs and focused on the name she will do better.  But her income stream is she gets 0.75% which translates to $322M+ a year from the $42.99B oversees.

People like Peter Lynch is a legend. From 1977-1990 he averaged +29.2% a year consistently missed SP index a couple of years. His fund was best mf ever during a 20 year span.",Vast_Cricket,11,/r/investing/comments/nabnrv/cathie_wood_deep_dive_into_her_20_year/gxsxb37/,0.027,0.846,0.127,0.9697

9,MSCI," remarkably, cathie actually managed to outperform the MSCI world by almost 100% even before covid. the question is though, whether she will be able to do so consistently over a period of 25 years or more, because that would make your money better off in her fund than elsewhere (after cost ofc). and even if she is able to do so, most fund managers who outperform are just lucky outliers. the way she talks about business and looking at her price goals, i must honestly say: i think she is lucky. someone with a more principled approach who actually managed to return 20% p.a. on average over several decades is peter lynch. and even he had at least *some* luck!",buy_side_quant,2,/r/investing/comments/nabnrv/cathie_wood_deep_dive_into_her_20_year/gxwe7ct/,0.0,0.882,0.118,0.9299

To that end, it seems as though CWoods is willing to stick to her DD and take chances/market opportunities, to hit those big returns. And people that invest in ARK should understand that there may be associated risks involved.

14,DD," This feels like a hit piece to me, yes the market was in her favors this year but she has significantly outperformed a sp500 index fund since starting Arkk. I think the nature of how she invests, researches and gets in early in young evolving markets and waits for them to flourish is the secret sauce to her strategy and it works.  The only problem is most investors atleast on here are too impatient and short term minded so the minute the market turns against her the lynch mob starts forming.

I’m not joining it and I view this as a great buying opportunity to get into arkk to each their own but she has been right about the companies she holds over and over again there is no questioning that even when people were telling her she was crazy she held her conviction and her strategy.  That’s not easy to do but that’s the type of person I want managing my money I can tell you that much.

The way I see it I have two options 1: sell and move everything into VOO and SCHD and eventually I’ll make it back probably over 2-4 years if the market isn’t currently crashing. 2: Hold on because when the funds move they move faster than the index and I can hopefully make it back within 1-2 years.

57,PT," Well, because the true objective way to value a company would be to know it’s exact cash flow/profits from right now until infinity, you could say that it’s all subjective because nobody could possibly know any of that, definitely not with any precision. Because it’s such a tall order to reach “objectivity” (you basically need to be omniscient - no big deal, just be God), it’s probably not worth too much time teasing out exactly what’s “objective” versus “subjective”.

The point I was making was more about the contrast between one person’s opinion versus the rest of the market. The market is made up of a bunch of subjective opinions, sure (because all human opinions are subjective by definition).  But it’s more of a wisdom of the crowds type of thing - this is the closest best guess our society has to price this asset.

Yeah, that’s not “objective”. It is a popularity contest, a voting machine. But for all intents and purposes, it’s the closest thing we could have to objectivity. And tbh, it barely matters, because it’s the only thing that has any practical use - nobody cares what PT a random single investor has on a stock. What matters is how much he can sell it for - that is an objective fact in the sense that there is the ability to sell that stock for that current price, and that’s a truth that everyone agrees on.",jkc7,4,/r/investing/comments/nabnrv/cathie_wood_deep_dive_into_her_20_year/gxu7u5v/,0.026,0.805,0.169,0.9897

64,MSM," Of course you are, that's the point of the MSM narrative.

If you look at the actual broken down components, used cars & trucks account for a third of the increase. Without them, inflation would be 2.8% YoY or 0.53% MoM. This is mostly due to supply constraints which will work themselves out. People are selling their used cars after a couple of years for a *profit*. You really think that's gonna last?

This adjustment alone brings inflation to *lower* than expected

Other line items that saw outsized increases

* Travel/air fares: 10% (think pent up demand during reopening; tbh I was expecting more in this area!)
* Car/truck *rental*: 16.2% (same thing, pent up demand during better weather, and perhaps unwillingness to *buy* now during inflated prices)
* Admission to sporting events: 10% (same thing, pent up demand)
* Lodging away from home: 7.6% (what do you think?)
* Other lodging away from home including hotels and motels: 8.8% (seeing a pattern?)

Moreover, when you compare these to last year's figures, when everything was shut down and we were at peak fear, of course it compounds how high it looks this year, relatively speaking. The Fed has said this over and over again

Imo, all this makes me more inclined to see the Fed's view that inflation numbers will be high based on short term supply and transitory issues, and will inflect back down.

Claim: when it comes to inflation and growth, Economists don’t even understand the theory of their *own* price and quantity indices mathematically:

Economists are holding their own field back by retaining their freedom to just cook up any revised index they want.

It’s as if physicists retained the right to define temperature differently every year based on a closed door meeting and manufactured new thermometers thereafter.

Watch the US CPI revisions and methodology going forward. People who like to print money tend to want to change their definition of inflation and therefore don’t like anyone taking away freedom to make up methodologies to suit their political objectives involving wealth transfer.

Moral: whoever constructs CPI and GDP numbers in a dynamic economy is in a position to fake higher growth and lower inflation if they are also in a position to stop the field from debating methodological advances that would restrict the freedom to make up index number recipes.",pbjsf,10,/r/investing/comments/nao0oo/inflation_surges_in_april_as_consumer_prices_leap/gxvvwaq/,0.053,0.76,0.188,0.9719

76,MMT," It's just historical fact. 

Take China for example -- the first society in human history to create paper money. 

It was merchants who first created fei-ch’ien or ""Flying Money"" around 750 AD. Tea merchants specifically. 

They were promissory notes that allowed them to store their Iron in one location, take ""Flying Money"" with them far away, and exchange it for the commensurate value in that new location. 

Very quickly the Government caught on and decided to monopolize Flying Money. 

 The Sung Dynasty was the first. They decreed that ONLY they could issue the currency and promised that it would be backed up by the commensurate value in Iron in the official treasury. 

But then in 1077, Shen Kua -- the minister of finance -- explained to the emporer a clever little scheme that, today, would be called MMT (Modern Monetary Theory):

>The utility of money derives from circulation and loan-making.  A village of ten households may have 100,000 coins.  If the cash is stored in the household of one individual, even after a century, the sum remains 100,000.  If the coins are circulated through business transactions so that every individual of the ten households can enjoy the utility of the 100,000 coins, then the utility will amount to that of 1,000,000 cash.  If circulation continues without stop, the utility of the cash will be beyond enumeration.

Thus the Govovernment decided to reduce the backing of their paper currency by iron to just 35% (soudn familiar). 

Eventually they just backed it by nothing and printed it to fuel wars, social programs and more (also sound familiar?).

The result was that the currency went to zero. 

They would not be the first. 

In fact over the course of 600 years, five dynasties had implemented paper money and all five made frequent use of the printing press to solve problems.  Economic catastrophe and political chaos inevitably followed.  Time and again, officials looked to paper money for instant liquidity and the immediate transfer of wealth.  But its ostensible virtues could not withstand its tragic legacy:  those who held it as a store of value found that in time all they held were worthless pieces of paper.

They all started with ""hard momey backed up in the treasury"" they all eventually gave that up, and in the end it was always worthless. 

In fact, during one of these collapses a Jewish merchant named Jacob d’Ancona happened to be in Sung China from 1271-1272. 

This merchant was in the right place at the right time.  The finest silks, satins, and most beautiful porcelains in the world could be purchased for a pittance with silver coin.  

He described one particular transaction:  the purchase of 600 porcelain bowls for a mere 200 silver grossi (12 ounces of silver).  Thanking and praising God, he declared, “with such goods my fortunes would be made.”  And while d’Ancona journeyed back to Italy, the Southern Sung Empire fell to collapse.

The citizens took whatever sound money they could find, sold anything and everything they could for it, and ran to the hills.

Of course the British did the same with their Tally Stick system. 

The Romans did the same with their currency. 

Same thing happened to the Byzantine empire. 

I could give you countless more historical examples, but the story is always the same. 

I mean, remember King Henry was called ""Old Copper Nose"" because he began debasing the silver coinage so much so, that it only had a light dusting of silver on the outside and the rest of copper, which would rub off on his protruding nose.

Governments think they have figured out a magic solution to all their problems -- that they can escape the natural laws of supply and demand and in fact defy all of nature itself-- and print liquidity forever by debasing their currency and it'll be fine since they have a monopoly on money. 

In every instance clever economists tell them its possible -- Keynes being the most recent to perpetrate the scam and MMT to be the most recent iteration. They whisper into Governments' ears and tell them exactly what they want to hear -- that they can print money forever and it has no consequences so long as they maintain total control and perform a series of delicate balancing acts.

Yet it always ends up the same with a 100% rate of certainty -- the easy money and constant debasement make the currency worthless and the whole house-of-cards Ponzi scheme comes crashing down.

In this case, the ENTIRE world is tied to one useless currency and more of it has been created in the last 15 months than in the its entire history of existence.

This will be the FIRST time in all of history that this outcome does not happen, despite the exact same series of actions taking place.**",ADHDbetz,15,/r/investing/comments/nao0oo/inflation_surges_in_april_as_consumer_prices_leap/gxv5ko5/,0.064,0.84,0.096,0.9387

I've really felt #1 for a long time now - there's always the spectre of a (yet another) massive market crash and ""lost"" time period. I've been very fortunate with investments, virtually all in the stock market. I've always been hesitant to step foot into real estate because I don't have a strong income cash flow (I have some very unique financial circumstances), and my knowledge of the area is relatively sparse. 

All that said, and at the risk of sounding completely out of touch, $1MM is like no money these days, and a major medical issue can cause you to burn through it in no time at all (I have relatives who needed skilled nursing care at EOL; $9-13k/mo bills are *super* common).

83,FT," Hello, very nice post.

There are many studies on this. I guess the most important thing is the style of life you conduct. If you earn $5 mln per year but you spend $3 mln in various things (expensive houses, personal assistants etc) you won't define yourself wealthy

So wealthy is the person whose style of life does not affect at all his income or networth

here an article I read years ago from the FT, about this topic

* you move up to FI, meaning further remunerative work is now optional

103,SO," My guess is that there will be some price relief over the summer but no big bubble burst. 

Like you say, there were a lot of retirees and seniors who would’ve sold last year, but didn’t want a bunch of strangers traipsing through their home during a pandemic. Plus there’s people who just delayed selling because they were able to pause their mortgage, so they decided to stay put for a little while. So I suspect a lot more homes will be hitting the market this summer from people who would’ve sold last year.

That said, there is SO MUCH pent up demand. I bought a house last year, so I know the nightmare of the current bidding process. And, from what I hear, it hasn’t gotten any better yet. Plus I know a lot of people who, after losing bid after bid, decided to take a break from looking at houses to try again in 6-12 months when they’ll have saved up more money.

So I think prices will stay high for a while, but not spike significantly anymore. Things are crazy, but we’re not in Dogecoin territory here.

128,CARA," Biotech has very idiosyncratic risks in that many companies in the space are ""one hit wonders"" developing a one drug candidate, and if that drug fails to get FDA approval or even faces a setback you can see the stock drop 50% or more overnight. Take a look at the chart for CARA from a few days ago as just one of many examples, although CARA is a bit more diversified, I believe. 

Another thing you need to assess is that a huge amount of small-cap biotech companies were basically zombies before March 2020 (trading at penny stock levels because of the aforementioned failure of their original drug candidates) and all of a sudden reinvented themselves as Covid vaccine/test/antibody treatment companies, with widely varying degrees of credibility. 

Finally, as the other poster said, a lot of biotech is pre-revenue and certainly pre-profit, and secors like this that need a lot of runway to be successful are under pressure lately as concerns about rates going up make it more expensive to fund these companies. 

An alternative to investing directly in biotech is to go a level up and look at bigger established pharma companies with diversified pipelines that do a lot of biotech M&A. These companies have less single drug risk, and are usually stable enough to pay decent dividends, as well, and also benefit from the rotation into value.",Optimal_Assumption30,6,/r/investing/comments/nak7na/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/gxu8x25/,0.066,0.826,0.108,0.8775
129,BNTX," > All of them have had a dip over the past 3 months - any ideas why?

For the same reason as growth broadly; huge rotation out of growth and particularly ""rapidly growing but unprofitable"" (which is a large chunk of small/mid biotech and probably a fair amount of large cap) and into reopening/inflation plays. Biotech (and aggressive growth broadly) did *extremely* well last year, this year it's re-opening/inflation trades (a lot of boomer stocks.)

140,GDP," No one knows in the immediate term whether it continues to dip or goes up. In terms of investing into stocks, it depends on you. If you can wait 20 years you will do OK with these indices at these levels.

36 SP500 CAPE implies a 2.8% earnings yield and historical GDP growth of 2% real would imply 4.8% real returns in the longterm (if you can wait it out). Of course you have to consider taxes as well which means the rate of return will be lower.

I say ""if you can wait it out"" because in the short term there is no guarantee that you won't lose money (on real terms even). 15 years may not be enough to breakeven on real terms even if a severe multiple contraction happens very far out.

It depends on the alternatives. Is the money you are investing money that you will likely have to spend in the next 10 years? If not, might as well invest it, if so then might want to think of other options. If your bank account would just be growing anyway, then put it in stocks.

Now, 5% real annualized returns in the long term is not bad (worse than before because of today's valuations). However, I wouldn't want to lock into a 30year treasury that will pay me 2% nominal returns. I wouldn't even want to lock into a 10 year treasury that will pay me 1.5% nominal returns. I wouldn't want to sit on cash for too long because then inflation will kill me. I wouldn't want to sit on commodities too much right now because I think they might be too expensive and fluctuate without giving a real return. I wouldn't want to be in crypto because I think the hype is at a peak and this is insanely risky and speculative for me. 

People say not to market time, but if you look at Jeremy Grantham's recent bloomberg interview he kind of gives a case for market timing. So to answer your question, there is a lot to think about but if you can truly set and forget equities for 20 years maybe just do it.

That link is a good starting point to determine what kind of investor you want to be. At 32 I would be only slightly risk averse but the current market climate is looking strange. Either way, definitely take on a large swath of growth ETF's.

I also use TD but I think I'll be switching to Vanguard. Most of the ETF's I own are VanG anyways. The brokerage does not matter very much if you're investing passively. If you're day trading TD has Thinkorswim which is awesome for that kind of thing, but its largely up to preference and not a big deal as you can roll your securities over to a new brokerage whenever you like (usually for about $50-$100). 

I've also tried WeBull - its trash. Coinbase if you're going to play with Crypto (setup takes 10mins).

For me, the main risk of INTC is ARM (NVDA) taking over the server market. You'd imagine that due to the power costs and desire for cores over raw speed that ARM would dominate. Most modern computing languages run on VMs (e.g. node/JVM/CLR which are themselves on top of an OS VM) so they won't notice the CPU architecture change.

Still, AWS's ARM server prices were disappointing compared to what I expected and developers will probably hate the idea of running their code on a different architecture than they develop on. INTC certainly has risks but I feel they're not as big as their price suggests. The main thing that stops me from investing in INTC is the question of whether I could make more money with less risk in something else.

247,OR," So as of right now, I have no interest in options or actually trading with borrowed margin money. IF I had over $25K in my account, what I would want to do is simply make trades as many times as I feel like in a single day ONLY using the amount I have in the account (a.k.a. again, not using any BORROWED money on margin, despite being a margin account). 

Now, just to clarify this part of your response: ""Basically you can day trade using you margin up to 4x of your starting cash balance that day""....and in reference to my initial question: so I could trade up to that full $25K as many times as I wanted in a single day? OR could I only trade the full $25K four times per day? And just to be clear, the T+2 rule does not matter at all in such an instance or....? 

Sorry for being confused but I like to get extreme clarity and I promise if you are able to simply answer these questions, it would seriously help clear this up for me.

248,PDT," My understanding of the PDT rule is 3 day trades in a 5 business day period.

249,GME," My understanding is you could trade that full $25k 4 times a day assuming you started the day with 100% cash, which means you would need to exit all trades the previous day.

If you start with say $10k invested in stocks your DTBP would only be $60k that day even if you sell that $10k at open.  That is how I got in trouble I traded beyond my DTBP and had to deposit $20k extra to cover that margin call.

Also if you drop under $25k your account will immediately be flagged as a Day trader account until it is back over $25k. Start slow.  Believe me I got really excited when I hit $25k and promptly lost like $4k so I had to slowly trade back over $25k again.

Also don't be afraid to use margin just be mindful of the risk.  If you buy $100k of shares and it goes up %1 you are up 4% on your investment (all works to the down side).  Plus there are some margin fees. Also some stocks like GME have 100% margin requirements other stable blue-chip are like 50%.  With ETrade all options are 100% margin requirement.",neothedreamer,1,/r/investing/comments/naez4g/very_specific_question_about_pattern_day_trading/gxthbn0/,0.045,0.883,0.072,0.659
250,ONE," First off, thanks for the info. Knowing something like what you said in your 2nd paragraph (re: starting with 10K invested in stocks then DTBP would only be 60K seems like very useful information that I will keep in mind that I may not have really thought about otherwise).

Second, the ONE THING here that I need clarification on now, if you have it, is where you said this: ""Also if you drop under $25k your account will immediately be flagged as a Day trader account until it is back over $25k.""

What specifically happens in such an instance where you are ""immediately flagged as a Day trader account""? Like, let's say if I start with $30K in the account at the beginning of the day and I make 10 trades that day. On the 10th trade, my account falls BELOW $25K. Considering that it sounds like I would now be flagged as a (Pattern) Day Trader, what happens THEN? Am I free to trade the following day but simply subject to the rule that I can not make more than 3 day trades in a rolling 5 day period until I once again have more than $25K? Or (and this will sound ridiculous but just checking), would it somehow be that since I had made 10 day trades that day (prior to falling below $25K), they will basically say ""Oh hey, you made 10 day trades and fell below $25K all in a single day and therefore you have made made more than 3 day trades in a rolling 5 day period and now we are going to lock your account from trading for 90 days (or whatever it is)?",MovieFilmHead,1,/r/investing/comments/naez4g/very_specific_question_about_pattern_day_trading/gxtif86/,0.025,0.923,0.052,0.6659
251,IMO," Got it. So not as grave as the article makes it out to be -- market makers could could just not redeem if they think it unwise (the risk is on their end, after all), whereas when an investor wants to take a redemption from a mutual fund, the fund manager is forced to come up with the cash. 

Seems a bit unethical to conflate the two scenarios IMO, but thanks for clearing this up for me!",non_burner,1,/r/investing/comments/naewos/how_do_etf_redemptions_work/gxuazyb/,0.074,0.856,0.069,0.2882
252,ARE," There's two scenarios; don't conflate them.

AS LONG AS you ARE buying shared from another seller, your thinking -is- correct -- ""not at all"" (or ""not much"").

When the situation crosses over to ""No more sellers"", then the Market Maker scenario kicks in, which is what some people are getting worked up over, above.  -They- have forgotten about scenario 1, and seem to be thinking that market makers have to get involved with every trade / all the time.",DeeDee_Z,1,/r/investing/comments/naewos/how_do_etf_redemptions_work/gxvbcrm/,0.05,0.92,0.029,-0.1779
253,NAV," Can you expand on scenario 2? It's my understanding that market makers do redemptions at their leisure (in order to capture risk free returns). Scenario 2 doesn't even sound like an ETF redemption tbh, it sounds like market makers are required to provide asks if there are none from retail? I suppose there is some path from having to provide such asks to redeeming a creation unit if the market maker keeps accumulating shares of the ETF, but the asks would be sufficiently above NAV to account for the risks in the first place, no?",non_burner,1,/r/investing/comments/naewos/how_do_etf_redemptions_work/gxvm2n1/,0.106,0.825,0.069,-0.5719
