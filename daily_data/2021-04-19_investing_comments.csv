Your very existence was priced in decades ago when the market was valuing Standard Oil's expected future earnings based on population growth that would lead to your birth, what age you would get a car, how many times you would drive your car every week, how many times you take the bus/train, etc. Anything you can think of has already been priced in, even the things you aren't thinking of. You have no original thoughts. Your consciousness is just an illusion, a product of the omniscent market. Free will is a myth. The market sees all, knows all and will be there from the beginning of time until the end of the universe (the market has already priced in the heat death of the universe).

50,TTCF," Full disclosure: I don't own any TTCF shares. I do NOT like Tattooed Chef as an investment, even at these current prices. I also do not follow Jeremy's investment picks, although, I don't have anything against the guy. I think he's a nice guy and I've seen some good videos put out by him, I just tend to disagree with some of his thesis.

Onto my opinions: TTCF didn't 'crash through the floor'. It dropped 10%... it was a rough day for TTCF.  There's 100's of stocks which have dropped far more than TTCF in the past month or so. Today one of Jeremy's picks are down hard... whelp, that sucks... shit happens.

I think there are a lot of petty individuals in here bashing a guy quite literally 'on the day' one of his picks are down 10%. Do I invest in TTCF? Nope. Do I follow his picks? Nope. But I'm not going to jump into an r/investing thread bashing Jeremy and his 'followers' when they're down on this particular day. Give it 5-10 years and judge his picks then, including TTCF.

At least give Jeremy credit for his consistency on TTCF. He's definitely a big TTCF fan and good for him because that's his belief.  I'd much prefer someone being consistent in their conviction regardless of how right/wrong they are, rather than someone who is flip flopping all over the place just tying to pump something and dump it the next week.  Jeremy is about that TTCF life... and I am not.

116,IBM," Good morning contrarians!

Futures are a bit lower this morning, with smallcaps seeing most of the selling (Russell 2000 down 0.6%). Dow Industrials are off about 0.2%. S&P 500 and Nasdaq down about 0.1%. That’s as of 0630.

It’s all about earnings today, with Coca Cola and M&T Bank due to report in the pre-market. Later we’ll have IBM, Prologis, Zions, and United Airlines.

This follows another record close for the Dow and S&P on Friday and some pretty nasty selling in cryptos over the weekend. Bitcoin dropped by about 15% before rebounding. This was all due to some unfounded rumors about the US Treasury Department looking to crackdown on cryptos. Sounds like a great stable of value.

There seems to be a bit of a wait-and-see approach in markets, which makes sense during earnings season. But there is other news affecting things. China’s back-and-forth on bitcoin is helping cryptos rebound. But then you have re-re-renewed concerns about coronavirus cases, this time in India. And hiccups with the vaccine rollout elsewhere.

Speaking of China, geopolitical concerns are something worth watching for the longer term. Probably more than coronavirus stuff.",The_Contrarian01,19,/r/investing/comments/mtwjks/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/gv2f40d/,0.02,0.877,0.103,0.9098
117,IMO,"  I'm a bit confused at the concern over today. It's a very, *very* minor pullback that is mostly isolated to tech (which is still absurdly priced in the aggregate).

Look, friends, no one likes red days. I'm not loving today either! But, the market has been nailing ATHs over the last few weeks without many serious catalysts (most were expected and largely priced in prior). Retail is almost certainly more enthusiastic than institutional, I'd argue irrationally so. When you have a market that gaps up consistently day after day, you want it to take a breather and find higher support levels. It wouldn't surprise me at all if there was a short-term, honest-to-god pullback in the near term and again, that's a healthy signal IMO.

""Stocks only go up"" is not a good thing unless your time horizon is like two months. Sometimes I feel like I'm the resident bear on this sub and I promise I am absolutely not a bear.

130,ATH," I wish it was just a 5% pullback from the February ATH by the Nasdaq and I only really got hit from mid-February to early March. It was 5% on the S&P, but not the Nasdaq.

But what happened there and afterward has a much more complicated story than just the Nasdaq dropping 10%+ from its ATH. Look at ARKK, look at IWO. Even though the Nasdaq was able to get going and had what turned out to be 3 very good weeks in a row, stocks in this basket couldn't really get going like they did in the rally we saw from November to mid-February and are still down a lot compared to February. To me that signals that the speculation fever likely ended then earlier than I thought it would.

I'm not a fan of the action at all today btw. The streak of the S&P not making a lower low from the previous day has ended and I'm not seeing much rotation underneath, which has played a big role in pullbacks staying minor. Now it's only one day but if the rotational mechanisms we've seen for a while underneath are going away, the risk of the S&P seeing an -8% is as high as it has been in seemingly forever.",95Daphne,1,/r/investing/comments/mtwjks/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/gv4bm6x/,0.024,0.895,0.081,0.9071

My current TIRA account (401k rollover): 139k (all in stocks, GME and AMC)

My objective: if the IRA grows to over a million, I would like to withdraw some of that money for major life purchases before the age of 59 1/2. I understand for both accounts, there will be a 10% penalty fee. Ideally, I would keep investing the IRA in different stocks and continue to grow it annually while taking out a small amount a year for myself.

My question: If I wanted to withdraw the earnings before the age of 59 1/2 after leaving the money alone for at least 5 years (ROTH limitations), which account should I have my IRA as - ROTH or traditional?",Larbear91,1,/r/investing/comments/mtwj0t/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gv3wx27/,0.061,0.876,0.063,0.0726

Do you have a source for that? I don't have one, just based on observation, but despite the events of the last few years FB continues growing at the same rate.
