26,OR," Frequency of buying and selling for positions held less than one year does not change your crypto tax burden in the US since crypto is not currently subject to wash sale rules, I don’t believe. 

For Federal taxes there is a safe harbor position that says if you have withheld either 105-110% (depending on income level) of your prior year tax OR 90% of your current year tax (either works, it’s not a “highest of the two”) then you will not be subject to underpayment *penalties* but will of course have to provide the tax that hasn’t been paid. If you make $100k profits day trading crypto in one quarter you should consider sending in an estimated tax payment for the profits, particularly if you do not meet the safe harbor provisions. 

Most importantly, if you have made, say, $100k of profits for the entire year of crypto trading on Dec 31 this year then you absolutely must, as soon as you can after Jan 1, withdraw or set aside or send in an estimated payment for the amount of tax you should owe on your 2021 profit. If you lose your entire account and all other money on Jan 2 it doesn’t matter… you still owe tax on that $100k profit from 2021. 

But day trading crypto on RH is not going to work the best… the spreads are enormous so you’re going to get eaten alive. Also, fair warning that if you have to ask these sorts of questions the answer is NO you should not be doing anything like this. You should put your money in a place where you can’t touch it because you’re going down a dangerous path. You will most likely lose it all.

322,ETH," Doesn't answer your question but it's dofficult to cast other crypto to fit moulds BTC or ETH (maybe a few other early ones as well) were established in because they both aimed to fill a space that wasn't filled yet. There was an inherent utility to their use and existence. I remember people trying to pump doge as a joke in maybe... 2018. Their goal was just to get attention so it'd be supported by more exchanges. Shiba people the last few weeks are worse then they were, fwiw. They're garbage spammers. Ask a question about a stock and one of those morons will pop in with just ""Shiba?"" like they're contributing.",CardinalNumber,1,/r/RobinHood/comments/nq3539/when_bitcoin_first_launched_where_their_people/h08elzl/,0.086,0.811,0.104,0.2836
