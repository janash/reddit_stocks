0,RH," It's not RH. In all honesty, nothing is just RH lately. All the negative press they are getting is only because of how popular they have become. They did not do a single thing that a handful of other firms didn't do as well, at the direction of the DTCC.

In regards to the $25k limit, it actually makes some sense if you understand how trades work behind the scenes. When you ""instantly"" buy a share, RH (or whoever you are using) has to put in a buy order for you at that price, and that transactions has a 2 day clearing period. You getting the stock instantly is just an illusion. Same thing when you sell a share. They put in the order to sell at that price, and it has a 2 day clearing period, and during that time, they ""give"" you some of their money temporarily until the 2 day clearing period is up, when they money comes back to them.

Now, think of the ""instant"" availability of cash with RH when you make a deposit. Technically.....you could initiate a $1,000 deposit from your bank....it takes a few days to go through so let's say you don't really have the money, or as soon as you initiate the transfer with RH, you then go and transfer that $1k to another account, effectively making it so RH won't get the money. They make it available to you instantly while the transfer is pending. Now let's say you go and buy 1,000 shares of a stock that is $1, using all $1k. That afternoon, the stock has risen to $2, so you sell, for $2k. You then initiate a transfer back to your bank for $2k, which will take a couple days. When it clears, the initial transfer has failed because the first $1k wasn't there, so the $2k transfer only goes through at $1k, or it fails completely, and leaves $1k in your RH  balance as your profit. In the end, you kinda cheated by buying with money you didn't have, then covered the expense with profit that was earned with RH's money due to their ""instant"" availability.

The day trade limit is to decrease the chances of stuff like this happening. They figure if you have $25k balance at the end of every trading day, you probably aren't going to screw them on money temporarily while day-trading, because your balance at close has to be $25k cash.

You can also get around this by changing your account to a cash account instead of an instant account. The bad part about this is that every transfer you make into RH isn't available instantly, it will only be available once it has posted. Also, when you buy or sell a stock, it won't be available instantly, it will have to follow the 2 day clearing period. The advantage to this though, is that you are not subject to the day trader rules if you don't have an instant account. Just remember your cash balance has to remain high enough to cover all your day trades for a 2 day clearing period.

53,API," >Banks give us the illusion of a delay simply so they can earn interest on our money

I think the reason is because many banks are still built on core DOS systems that they haven't figured out how to upgrade.  Theoretically switching to API systems (or blockchain) would allow more real-time transfers, but until then they rely on batch processing that they reconcile back-and-forth.

When Wednesday came my Monday trades cleared and I had the 2500 again. Thursday my Tuesday trades cleared and I had the money again. So I always had money to daytrade ever day.  Then it grew to 10 k and I had 5k a day.  Your trades will be limited but you will be smarter about what you trade.  It’s also nice cause you can’t over trade.

59,GME," Margin yes, but switching to cash means, by the same FINRA rules, that any cash used to day trade is unavailable to T+2 days.  So, you cannot get around day trading limits if you are using most of your portfolio for buying then selling, then buying again.  It is one of the reasons why Robinhood had to shut down buying of GME, in a sense.  You buy a stock today, you do not technically own it the second you buy it, there is a delay.  Then you sell it without owning it first due to the delay, then you use the same funds to do it again.  On the surface it makes sense, but there is a lot of behind the scenes that people do not know about, me included, and places like Robinhood (and all the other institutions involved) need to legally ensure all your buys and sells of stock are legit.",AriaTisa,3,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/lh78uu/getting_your_rh_account_locked_for_day_trading_is/gmyg4f4/,0.037,0.899,0.064,0.4939

63,AAPL," If that one stock consumes your entire liquid portfolio value, then yes, it’s possible. Although you should note, it isn’t a GFV until you **sell** a security you bought with *unsettled* funds. 

so to give an example. let’s say you have just enough to buy 1 share of TSLA @ $800 per share. it’s now spiked to $900 a share so you sell it (let’s say you did this on a Monday). you now have $900 in your cash account, and these are unsettled funds.

because of the T+2 rule, these funds won’t typically be settled until Wednesday. now on Tuesday, you see that AAPL is trading lower than usual. So you decide to buy a couple shares of that. But come Tuesday afternoon, AAPL share price has gone up unexpectedly, and you decided to take the profits. 

because you purchased AAPL with unsettled funds, and sold it before those funds settled, you’ve committed a violation. 

in order to have avoided that violation, you should make sure you have **more** funds than the amount you are using for one trade. 

so in that same example, had you had $2000 to start with on Monday, and bought the $800 share of TSLA, and sold at $900, you’d have $900 unsettled funds, and $1200 settled funds. 

you then decide to buy $800 of AAPL. most (if not all) brokerage firms will automatically default to buying using settled funds. So you will be left with $400 settled funds, $900 unsettled funds, and your $800 of AAPL which you can sell in “good faith” at anytime of your choosing.

If you got in when you first saw it mentioned on WSB, you may have done well, but most people bought yesterday or this morning, and - well, if they bought yesterday and held, they're probably still ok, but if they bought this morning because of the what they read on WSB after work yesterday, they're probably a little salty. 

I think OP is just saying this sub is a lot more civil, and there's a lot more substance here than just rocket and moon emojis.

148,SNDL, ya I bought a $1 call option for 2/26 SNDL for $50 on the spec of decriminalization. then it got pumped by WSB and i got to sell at $185 a week later. my plan is to buy more options next week after it falls flat and then hunker down and wait.,cybrantyrant,5,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/lhmfxg/protip_if_you_see_a_stock_promoted_on_wsb_avoid/gmyk4j4/,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

276,SNDL," There is a big problem with survivorship bias when it comes to stock discussion. 

Very few people are going to post when they lose money but people love to post to talk about how much money they are making. This gives a disproportionate sense of how many people are making money vs losing. 

This is also why I think it's unfortunate how much people just non-stop post their gains posts (despite us having rules against it). It really misrepresents the market when somebody YOLOs a bunch of money into SNDL and then celebrates their gains. You'll rarely see anyone post about how they YOLO their money into a penny stock, lose a huge percentage and limp away (or diamond hands hold devalued shares).

This is just a continuation of why we post DD.  We have a plan, if we give details and get others on board, it increases either the potential gain or potential chance our plan will work.

For instance, I am confident in my current ZOM hold but SNDL is starting to get a lot attention from the wrong avenues than I would like and I don't cashing out early tomorrow to make sure I lock in gains.

400,BOXL," BOXL - Education industry. Plenty of upside. Leadership and growth continue to look promising. Especially with the Biden administration’s COVID Relief package. ~$170B of the proposed Biden COVID Relief plan is towards education. 

For those curious - this is a software/hardware based company that’s in the education market that develops, sells educational software, classroom technologies, professional development and support services. STEM focus.

They have a presence in over 70 countries, and continue to win clients.

For those who do not have the scientific literacy to really understand biopharm (a current stock trend/P&D) BOXL looks like a solid bet for mid to long-term gains.

Review what you've got ahold of, and adjust your plans.  There's a reason you picked those stocks (aside from the obvious to make money, no shit, but how were those specific stocks going to make you money), make sure you still think the plan will pan out.

Today was red across the board for alot of stocks.  Disney was down for a bit, SPY was down most of the day, even Daddy Elon got pecker slapped.  Alot of the penny stocks we look at are kind of getting circle jerked by the horde of GME bagholders who can no longer lie to themselves that 💎🤲 is gonna pan out tomorrow, and they're just throwing themselves into whatever ""DD"" gets the most upvotes or 🚀🚀🚀, creating little PnDs that can tweak trajectories.

830,AP," From what I can tell, what they’re developing is some sort of booster shot that improves your body’s immune response after initially receiving the already approved vaccines (the one that allows your body’s T-cells to detect COVID-19 by allowing T-cells to recognize the spike protein that has been sequenced by the NIH), by increasing T-cell activity (cells involved in immune response by detecting antigens, such as the spike protein, and sending out antibodies that kill foreign bodies that carry such antigens, aka COVID-19). Their booster shot apparently does so using the TLR-4 Adjuvant that they injected into infected mice during their animal trials, and the graphs seem to show that mice whose lungs and nasal cavities received the booster shot in tandem with the vaccine had little to no concentrations of COVID-19 after 2 days. 

What this seems to mean is that their booster shot, if similar results are seen in humans, would decrease the transmission of COVID-19 of those who have received the vaccine and booster shot by killing it off in your lungs and nasal cavity, as well as increase the activity of your body’s cells that kill COVID-19.

I can’t speak for how this will affect the stock but the progress of the booster shot does seem interesting to follow in the long term in reducing the spread of future infections in the long run and improving the efficacy of the current vaccine. However, it hasn’t yet reached clinical trials and it may be a little late by the time it can be rolled out. Overall, I think I might personally hold off on buying for now, but it shows some promise.

Disclaimer: This is not financial advice and most of this analysis comes from some knowledge on the topic from previous experience in high school AP bio courses and a quick look at the research paper included in the article. I don’t really know much about developments in the vaccines used for COVID. Also I currently have no shares of the company at the moment.

835,DD," Wait, Russia is thinking about exporting their vaccine to Europe, so they won't take much longer than Q4. Their vaccine is 90% effective btw., Those numbers were tested by European regulators and the vaccine approved for use in its territory.
China won't accept any foreign products for this issue, as they want to show their superiority over the rest of the world (at least in their internal propaganda).
All other countries will either already be entirely vaccinated (the rich ones) or won't be able to pay much for this additional vaccine (the poor ones).
If the Covid shot becomes a yearly thing, like mentioned in another answer, this product obviously gets more attractive.

917,CEO," In theory, sure. In actuality, I don’t buy it. SNDL was previously not running in response to positive news the way other cannabis stocks were. 

For example, when the senate went blue. Perfect example. All of the cannabis stocks soared. It was a good day! Except for SNDL, which barely bumped at all and then settled back down almost immediately. Like it always did. 

Again, I know people tout the new CEO and zero debt DD. But what is the new DD compared to when it was trading sub $1 and where it is trading now? What has changed for the company in that period of time? 

Seems to me the big change is it’s being pumped hard AF on reddit. That’s the new variable in the situation. That’s why it’s running. 

Could SNDL be successful? Yeah. Of course. No one can predict the future. And I wouldn’t claim to be able to.

TLRY is short term and APHA is long term from what information I have gathered. 

Once the merger happens you will get 0.83 shares of TLRY for every 1 share of APHA you own. Basically getting APHA now is getting you discounted TLRY. This is assuming TLRY holds its price.

The merger is scheduled for Q2 sometime in April-May.

1177,GME," The merger hasn’t gone through yet. Tilray has a larger short % and some of it may be that. Redditors are pumping it. When it dumps it will dump back down to the twenties. I think it’s kind of what happened to GME. It got pumped by hype not the short squeeze. I still see a squeeze on GME btw but not much because they have ladder attacked and held off long enough. Those people making money on tilray and aphria and a lot of the other weed stocks are catching the pump from retail Reddit hype. You are just getting money from FOMO, only if you bought it low or got in on the start of the hype. Those people who are buying now are pumpers who will either lose or catch a very small gain. Just my opinion. All these weed stock prices will go back to normal next week or two. They are still good stocks and if legalization goes through they will be good stocks to have in my portfolio. I expect these prices after legalization but right now it’s all hype and FOMO pump and dump.",jedidopedawg,1,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/lh8jx0/apha_vs_tlry_and_sndl/gmw5idp/,0.085,0.853,0.062,-0.3679

1181,DD," Supposedly it's been a good year for oil production, and no matter how big the green push is there will be a need for oil for decades to come.

Also, it's almost guaranteed to pump this week still (cheap, decent DD, on RH) so there'll be potentially to reclaim your investment and let the rest ride long term.

1184,TYME, Yes. Being a direct offering could be kinda good. That means institutional investors think it's good deal at 2$  and that could create a new low/consolidation level at 2$. It will probably dip a bit under that and then go up again.

1188,CS, Don't use it then? Idk what you want me to say. I've had issues handled with CS on more than one occasion. A lot of people lose money on an app and think it's the apps fault. I don't use robinhood because of the lack of extended hours trading. I actually lost a small account on robinhood by switching my phone lol. No new number just a phone replacement.
