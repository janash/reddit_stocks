0,USA," Truth is you all eat Chinese food.
Buy Chinese products
Use Chinese made phones

And you want to short China…enjoy knowing, everything you do and touch….is 80% china…some industries you will make money because stocks go up and they go down. Just like the recent education stocks.

But The scary thing, their economy is still “developing”……imagine when it’s really running. They still got many people who make $1000 a year…. Just imagine 1.4 billion making an average salary of 30-50k per year (like western counties). They will catch up, many 1st tier cities have salaries so high, it makes other cities salary a shame. 

Also These people cannot buy stocks in Hong Kong stock markets easily or any other foriegn markets. If China allows their average citizen to invest $50,000 per year in foreign markets. Our markets will inflate from the cash. The Chinese government is thinking of opening this for their people and every western country is drooling.

Also Decoupling trade is a myth….because what idiot country wants to miss out in the worlds largest middle class consumers. This is why USA cannot squash them like Syria or some other country we can sanction. There is trillions $$$$ to be made by all these companies who want to go wild in China. But the Chinese government is saying “foreign corporations will not control or harm our society just because you think you have cash”

Many people also do not realize, the Chinese government is slapping the “Chinese companies” because they are also sending a message  to foreign companies. We will slap our own Chinese companies, don’t think we won’t touch your foreign companies.. We will fine you billions, if we find your price gouging our citizens, monopolizing industries and preventing local business from competing. This is happening because China is starting to allow foreign  companies to own 100% ownership, prior to this, it was always a joint venture. This is why companies like Goldman Sach, don’t say anything negative about China because they are ones of the very rare wholly own foreign financial companies in China.

So It’s very simple to these foreign companies , if you want trillions of $$$ to be made in China consumers, you play by their game. Not our western ideology.  This is why many business keep quiet because they have to give their shareholders (many of us) a reason for growth. They want that money.

You can call the Chinese a commie or whatever but I will leave you with this

I would say that common progression would be currency, then country and government debt coupled with possible changes in credit. Afterwards, you would start to see the effects in equity, real estate, and finally the real economy.

11,EM," I've spent considerable time playing through scenarios of how this may play out if it were to potentially happen. Given, on a shorter term time frame, the best time to short China was 3 months ago, but on a longer term time scale (years to decades), the name of the game is to just be long USD currency pairs, and short the US companies who utilize Chinese manufacturing heavily. I think Hypothetically you would probably want to be short commodity providers to China from countries like Australia as well, but that's hard to say.

If you were to see a true China bust, this would probably be a decent safe haven. The logic behind being long USD is that China would see a their capital controls deteriorate, leading to a rapid devaluation in RMB. You then would also get massive covering in global credit markets, leading to a surge in demand for USD. Similarly, as the situation would deteriorate in China, they would be incentivized to sell more of their US bonds and treasury notes, which would likely be followed by other EM Countries. All of the above would cause a rise in US yields, which then would exacerbate the feedback loop of a surging USD.

BTW, not suggesting this is a good trade to make. The rules of how economies behave are a lot different in a country with near 100% control over all the levers of the economy when compared to free market systems. The tradeoff with communist highly controlled systems is that they avoid the booms and busts of capitalist markets, but the downside is that they can't avoid busts in perpetuity, an when they do occur, they pretty much just destroy the entire system itself due to the accrued imbalances.

Basically, in any runaway global credit squeeze, the only asset that would likely go up is the single asset the rest of the world is largely short of, which in the current day is the reserve currency.

Honestly speaking, I don't think most people understand how bad a true China bust would be for the global economy. This probably sounds bombastic, but I don't think it would be all that different from how the global economy reacted to the great depression in America in the 1930's.

Additionally, any collapse in China would likely entail global conflict as well. And Global conflict is where various capital markets basically go to zero. IE, France during WWII, or Great Britain during WWI (inflation adjusted). That's something that doesn't get discussed ever during any ""stock markets always go up"" type discussion.

15,IMO," Easy answer: short Shanghai or hong kong indexes or look for etfs with a lot of exposure to China. 

If you are looking for advice from a random internet stranger: i really wouldnt. I think the end goal of the stuff currently going on with China is to make the exchanges in China more prestigious by forcing large companies in China to think twice before listing overseas (and force world trade from London and NY to Shanghai). The idea that you have that western money will not flow to China anymore in the near future has little basis in reality if you look at the data. People really underestimate the role China plays in the world economy. Stock prices still reflect people have not come to terms with the current reality.

There are a segment of western capital moving into China right now as Chinese locals are trying to move out.)

Back to commentNaN's point, it's not a good idea to short an entire country because *""keep reading about how there is capital flight from China going on, because people inside China are trying to get their money out of the country.

**FOR OP**: Please note whenever you consume any media that there is always a specific and targeted story, angle, and audience at play. Western/Anglo media has often portrayed China as a quickly rising threat or as a flawed regime on the verge of collapse.

I'll just note that Xi and CCP are using regulations to reign in outliers, strengthen their own power, **AND/WHILE** making some short-term painful decisions that they believe will yield long term benefits for the people/country which would ultimately keep the CCP in power.

22,GDP," >The simple truth is that everyone who bet against China’s economy over the past 30 years were wrong. Zero exceptions.

In a lot of senses, this is exactly why there is a lot to be worried about. I'm a big believer in the Minsky viewpoint of economics, and China in my opinion will be perhaps the best case study on this when looked at in retrospect.

FWIW, the basic summary for those that aren't familiar is that stability  leads to instability. In other words, the reliance on government intervention backstopping risk has caused investors to feel more comfortable taking risks since they come to the conclusion that they will always be bailed out of the risky positions. Typically this leads to large buildup in debt, which tends to tip over when the productivity gains from the credit expansion stops being accretive to real GDP. Eventually, the embedded risks build up to a tipping point where the system simply implodes in on itself under its own pressure. [Read more about Minsky's views here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyman_Minsky).

Getting any timing right on these types of things is all that really matters, and it's where the majority of China bears have been wrong over the past 2 decades. They apply concepts and views that would work in western free market capitalist economies to a planned and not entirely open economy. The result is that China can backstop a lot more risk than any western economy can, which frustrates every bear calling for collapse. But that doesn't mean there is no risk - what it means is that the Chinese economy is becoming more and more fragile, and trading fragility for extending the duration of the bull market.",cbus20122,10,/r/investing/comments/ozkr1l/serious_question_how_do_we_short_china/h828pf8/,0.095,0.859,0.046,-0.8527

24,AI," Bitcoin and US, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand property are all artificially high due to Chinese capital flight. People in China know they are sitting on a 2008 debt bubble times 1000.

They are trying to get their money converted into dollars anyway they can, even at a risk of buying property at the high. A 20% drop in property or crypto is better than a 90% in currency. 

When things go south, and that might be 10 years from now, or 20, China is going to stop the ability to transfer money out of the country. Since that money is driving crypto and property, you could short it.

Issue is, you don’t know the timeframe, or if China invents some crazy AI that can overcome their demographic bomb that is on track to burst their economic bubble.

25,USA," >I agree that a China collapse would be economically painful, but take me through the links wherein that collapse leads to military conflict.

There are a lot of ways this can go, but the two main scenarios you tend to see repeat on a historical basis are as such:

1. Chinese government continues to clamp down and exert control on their population internally, all while consolidating more and more power. Scenarios like these often see regimes pushing to redirect unrest from the internal population due to lower growth or increasing internal problems outward onto an external enemy. IE, this is the path where you don't see economic collapse, but you see the government pull all the levers to prevent that and maintain their own power, which leads to more nationalistic and expansionist tendencies. 
   1. Historical examples of this include: Stalinist Soviet Union, Nazi Germany, Mussolini's Italy, Putin's Russia, Imperial Japan, etc. To an extent, you could also say that the USA post great depression under FDR had characteristics of this as well. Obv the examples provided here are extreme - I'm sure there are some more mild examples that aren't all ""literally hitler"", but on the whole, there is a very clear pattern of behavior that can be seen here that China has been following. 
2. Government can't prevent collapse, and you see infighting and instability grow from within the country. This scenario has largely been the history of China for over 1000 years. The CCP is well aware of this and is going to try to stop it, but if they can't, you would probably see civil conflict break out, which could metastasize into other countries around the world. 
   1. Historical examples of this would include Czarist Russia in WWI, Ottoman Empire in WWI, Weimar Germany, Soviet Union towards the end of it's existence, the Roman Empire, France at the end of the monarchy heading into the French Revolution, etc.
   2. One thing to note is that a lot of the time, internal collapse and internal civil conflict leads to rebirth under an authoritarian which later leads to the type of scenario you see in point 1 (expanionist authoritarian gov't.). EX: the french revolution and civil war lead to Napoleon. The Russian revolution and civil war lead to expansionist USSR. The Weimar collapse lead to Nazi Germany. 

Behaviorally, I think the first scenario is where China is likely to head, but that's difficult to say for sure. And of course, none of this is to say China can't right the ship and tone things down.",cbus20122,1,/r/investing/comments/ozkr1l/serious_question_how_do_we_short_china/h82cmhx/,0.138,0.797,0.065,-0.9909
26,USA," > China liquidating all or even large portions of its US Treasury holdings would hugely drive up US Treasury yields, and thus the cost to the US of servicing its debt. That in turn would affect US fiscal budgets, wouldn't it? Or does the fact of US dollar being global reserve currency mean that fiscal spending is not affected by debt servicing? (The latest US infrastructure bill tells me that spending has become totally decoupled from any constraining factor other than dependence upon being global reserve currency)

Higher US Yields would drive up demand for US sovereign debt, which would lead to higher demand for the US Dollar. It would increase cost of servicing debt, but that's not all that relevant given that the USA has a printing press that allows it to service its debt whenever it wants with the tradeoff being that it can drive real yields lower in doing so (which would theoretically drive inflation in either assets or consumer products higher).

Given, the central bank can and would help to keep yields in check, and if yields rose high enough, you would probably see a surge in demand for that safe haven.",cbus20122,2,/r/investing/comments/ozkr1l/serious_question_how_do_we_short_china/h82d5t0/,0.084,0.844,0.072,-0.1376

28,GM," Let me give you an example using astrophysics.

We can never directly observe blackholes, purely by their definition. No information directly escapes from blackhole, not even light. But astrophysics can measure blackhole's spin, mass, and charge by looking at how it affects and interacts with nearby celestial bodies. Using Kepler's equation we can find out the mass of a blackhole,  and with mass and angular momentum we can calculate the Schwarzschild radius (event horizon size) of the blackhole. This is why we have a ton of information and have proof of blackholes without ever being able to observe one directly.

Now look at China, even if you think all of their economic numbers are behind an event horizon where not even light can escape (which is obviously no true, but I'll entertain you here), we can *still* get a ton of information simply because China is one of the markets for half the Fortune 500 companies out there. If China's economy catches a cold then companies like GM, Apple, Intel, Boeing, Starbucks, etc would all start sneezing. 

Conversely, if all those companies are reporting great performance in China (which they have been), then we can infer with high confidence that the Chinese economy is doing quite well. Unless you think all those companies are cooking their books too.

And that's just on the consumer side, after all we also have a ton of companies with entrenched supply chains and billions of investments in China too. We have hundreds of thousands of foreigners living/working/studying in China, with thousands of foreign owned factories/stores/offices and millions of Chinese employed by foreign employers. 

If you use even a tiny shred of critical thinking, it becomes obvious that it's virtually impossible to hide serious economic problems in the 2nd largest economy in the world, in today's global economy.

31,ALL," >	Bitcoin and US, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand property are all artificially high due to Chinese capital flight. 

Chinese capital flight as the main driver of property price increases is a myth in Australia. Foreign investors only made up about 3% of buyers in the Australian property market in the first quarter of this year. Yet Australian (particulary Sydney & Melbourne) property continues to go up in leaps and bounds this year. Also keep in mind that 3% figure is for ALL foreign investors, so Chinese investors make up only part of that 3%. [source](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/jul/08/more-than-80-of-australians-mistakenly-believe-chinese-investors-are-driving-up-house-prices)

Also, Chinese investment in Aus property peaked in 2015-16. It’s dropped off since then:

>	Australian Foreign Investment Review Board data shows that amid political tensions with China and COVID lockdowns, investment in Australian real estate from China declined significantly from its peak of almost $32 billion in 2015-16 to $7.1 billion in 2019-20. [link](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-07-02/chinese-overseas-buyers-australia-property-housing-investors/100259470)

In 2015-16, China was the biggest source of foreign investment in Aus property. In 2019 both the US and Singapore were outranking China.

I’m not saying that CN capital flight has no effect, but you shouldn’t overstate it’s importance. Property prices are increasing because interest rates have continued to drop, which has allowed domestic buyers to borrow more. We’ve also had high levels of immigration into Aus for the last couple of decades so there is lots of demand for propety while our population grows.",DrizzyDradle,11,/r/investing/comments/ozkr1l/serious_question_how_do_we_short_china/h817u57/,0.033,0.937,0.03,0.34

Even if I grant you the assumption that Chinese education is bad for innovation, I don't think it necessarily follows that China can never pass the USA (it's not actually clear to me what ""move past the USA"" even means when you say that).

54,AMZN," Hi,

You're reading \*\*\*\*way\*\*\*\* too much into PE.

First, as far as TSLA goes, AMZN routinely had PEs in the 400-600 range in the early 2010s.  Yet the stock never collapsed.  The earnings rose to meet the valuation.  

Second, you're implying that we're going to hit a big recession like 2008, but what you're missing is that \*\*\*we already had that recession\*\*\*\*.  Earnings have been way down over the last year for many bell-weather companies.   What you're seeing in valuations across the broad market is the legitimate expectation of earnings rising back to previous growth rates.

Third, you don't understand the economics of tech.  First, the pandemic forced lagging US and  other western businesses to become involved in the tech economy.  Second, American and western tech companies are capturing a massive share of the world economy that wasn't reflected in the stock market even just a few years ago.  

Fourth, you don't understand the rapidity with which tech can scale.  In the past it took a department store chain 15 years to build-out across the US.  A tech company can reach that scale in one tenth the time.

Valuations may well be somewhat high and the moment.  Sooner or later there will be a correction and alot of sorting out will happen.

68,REAL," As a rule of thumb, all assets are priced relative to the risk free rate and a 1% rate change in either direction would affect fair valuations by something like 10%.

Keep in mind this time the fed has lowered their expectation of the long term target rate from 4% down to 2%ish. 

In previous tapers it was still using a 4% target and the market panicked because that was way too high and would significantly contract fair valuation multiples if reached.

We have seen the market react with lukewarm concern already for REAL rate increases, when the 10y rate went up over 1% in a short timeframe earlier this year, so a fed taper is partly already priced in and really shouldn’t affect prices all that much, maybe 10% down or less.",vansterdam_city,5,/r/investing/comments/ozmctt/can_someone_explain_the_effects_of_tapering_to_me/h810xot/,0.047,0.855,0.097,0.7096
69,TPR," Great answer. I will try to add on by addressing OP's other question

>Wondering when I should start selling some of my winners. Example) If I have a retail stock like Gap that Im currently up 15% in.. once tapering begins, what would that do to the stock?

I would probably say you should consider a bunch of things including the quality of stock, price you bought at, investment horizon, ***what you plan to do after buying cash***, and tax implications. 

For a solid company like GAP outside of a tax-exempt account, then I don't think you'll gain much from selling since tapering does not guarantee a crash or even a huge correction. Many on r/investing I've spoken to expect or foresee a correction, but most will say it's a 5-15% correction rather than a 20-50% one that we saw during the pandemic. I would suggest thinking of it more like: selling the stock = buying cash. I bought TPR around $15. It went to $50. Then I'd ask myself not if I should sell but what do I plan to do with the cash, because selling TPR would also be buying cash. I didn't sell at $50 because I still liked the company and wanted to hold it long term rather than whatever alternative plan I had for the cash.

If you're in a highly speculative name running on hype or it's likelihood to squeeze hedge fund short sellers rather than fundamentals that's gone up 2-100x and you've held it over a year for the long term capital gains or have it in an IRA/401K? Then maybe ***I*** would take some profit? But then again ***I*** would do that regardless since I'm not going to wait for the taper to rebalance, reallocate, and diversify funds.
