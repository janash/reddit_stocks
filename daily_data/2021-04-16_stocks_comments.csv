Well... I mean that's kind of the whole point of an ETF isn't it? Who does research on the S&P500 before buying into an index that mirrors them? 

For a sector like Genomics you aren't researching the businesses, you're researching the sector and if it's going to grow overtime or not.

I think the way people react with NIO shows why there's inevitably going to be a huge crash in most of the EV startups in the future. Everyone insists every EV startup is the next Tesla, without looking into what made Tesla become the success they are today. Not to mention they don't ask if the market conditions that allowed Tesla to become what it is today are even still there for other EV startups. It took well over a decade of R&D for Tesla to become what they are today, EV startups today don't have that kind of time, the auto market isn't complacent today like it was when Tesla entered it.

Hence why China is focusing on their economic impact in the Middle East. They don’t actually pay for the oil shipped to them due to the fact countries like Iran and Egypt buy things from China. It makes it almost even trades. This is also why China is gaining footholds across the Middle East. There’s more than 4,000 Chinese-state-owned businesses in the Middle East and that number is increasing, in fact in many areas of the Middle East there’s “Chinatowns” where it’s just thousands of Chinese people living there. Honestly I wouldn’t be surprised to see China eventually taking over some oil or getting it for free due to their growing economic control as well as their plans to build massive high tech infrastructure in these countries such as their plans to rebuild Syria and Iraq or “Saudi Vision.” So while sure they’re a net importer, they’ve built trust and allies in the Middle East and are supporting them economically as well as buying out middle eastern businesses to expand Chinese control.

44,NIO," Woah woah woah cowboy. Before you get your panties in a twist - I don't give two shits about NIO either way. It's just some other company to me.

Walk me through how NIO plans to implement battery swap technology. Compare that footprint to Tesla's SuperCharging network and how reproducible it is or isn't.

* What will NIO do if a battery swap doesn't work? Will they send someone out? How long will the stall be out? Do you just leave your car there and they bring you a loaner?
* How many battery swap stalls will there be and how much will they cost? Where will they put them? What's the physical footprint of the stalls? 
* How long will a battery swap take? 15 minutes? Why not just plug your car in at a Supercharger or similar?
* What happens if one of these NIO battery swap stations gets very busy? How will they continuously swap out the batteries? 
* Will they only swap out the batteries if they are fully charged? If not, what if you show up and there aren't any fully charged batteries? How long will you wait?
* If NIO charges the batteries very fast, why even swap them out?
* Does NIO have the capital to build out 5,000-10,000 locations? 
* etc. 

You can think through these questions easily enough to see that swapping out the batteries won't work and doesn't make sense. NIO already knows this and is working on increased range marketing over swapping out the batteries.

45,NIO," For wide scale adoption it requires all manufacturers to use a common battery pack design. This alone kills the plan as BMW and VW have flat out refused so it will end up being a NIO only scheme.  

The cars themselves end up being much heavier and more expensive as in most EVs the battery pack is a structural component, making it removable means reinforcing the chassis so the car doesn't warp when you remove it.

The plan also cannot last long term, think how many varieties of battery each station would have to carry to cater for older vehicle models. It would balloon to absurdity very quickly. 

Growth is also massively curtailed as to break into new markets you need to set up this battery swapping tech nationwide. If you don't the car you sell is basically gimped by being build around a service you cannot use.  

The reality is you could build it but the car you sell will be expensive, complex, tied to some battery swapping service that will no doubt be expensive itself etc and in the end will not compete against an EV from the likes of VW that you just plug in to charge.",_Madison_,2,/r/stocks/comments/mrs75p/peter_lynch_must_read_quote_from_late_2019/guqj9ww/,0.055,0.917,0.027,-0.5805

If you're talking about a malfunction, I would assume that the same thing happens when any other thing gets broken. Someone goes to fix it. The CEO says that 500 swap stations will be installed this year, and that's a conservative number. It's like a gas station or a supercharger. When there's someone using it, you wait.

The swap stations will also have a difficult time scaling if NIO achieves any sort of demand. Not to mention, the vast majority of EVs are going the plug-and-charge route, so it's like building your own infrastructure for your own cars, except it's small scale and you're competing with everyone else.

It's got little to do with the fund managers opinion, as it's not actively traded...

The only reason it's rebalancing significantly today is because the S&P Clean Energy index is changing its definitions as to what is/isn't included and capping the weighting of any particular company. INRG/ICLN is **forced** to do the same, they aren't choosing to.

107,GME," I made money too shorting it from the $300+ down to the hundreds. Glad you had fun and made money too. but doesn't change the fact that GME has zero business at the price it is currently or before... 

the mechanics are understandable (short squeeze), but the lunacy that came behind that was insane. 

people legit think that GME is going ""to the moon"" and it makes me sick. Legit idiocy",SilentBob890,1,/r/stocks/comments/ms4niw/the_new_normal_25_of_the_sp_100_companies_are_70/guriio5/,0.102,0.845,0.053,-0.705
108,GME," I'm gonna explain this because I think it's worth explaining, and you're free to your opinions on GME and on anything, but I am detecting some dickishness on your part and I think it deserves to be called out.

GME was cool because it showed that retail investors can win at this game, too.  So big hedge funds like Melvin Capital can hope to multiply their wealth by shorting a dying firm into the ground, yeah?  But the people who are just trying to make ends meet working at a company like Gamestop or similar from 9-5 have no hope of ever participating in that kind of play.  And in fact they often see their very livelihood threatened by these hedge funds and other financial entities.

Take the case of 2008 for example.  Wall Street banks can profit off of unethical practices, normal people can't.  And when the music stops, not only do the Wall Street firms get bailed out, they also take down the whole Main Street economy with them.  

People are tired of Wall Street and the wealthy always having the upper hand.  They almost always win, and most of the time they win big.  When they don't win, they can't lose, because the government's there to bail them out.

My degree is in economics.  I know the bailout was necessary to save the economy.  But it doesn't change the fact that the common people are fed up with this dynamic.  They are fed up with it, and they have every reason in the world to be.  People's livelihoods were dramatically, dramatically effected by this sort of behavior.  

GME represented the first time that retail could win in a big way.  And even then, they didn't win.  Robinhood cut off the trading.  But still, it was a major breakthrough.  Average Joes showed that via social media the odds have been evened a bit.  Now it's not just hedge funds and mega financial entities that can win at these big plays... retailers have a shot, too.

Some people look at it is ""bringing the Hedgies down"", ""death to the 1%"", etc.  I'm not necessarily part of that crowd.  But no matter what side of the political spectrum you're on, if you're a retail investor, just an Average Joe, you can be proud of what happened with GME.  It was a victory for us.  It meant a leveling of the playing field, if only ever so slightly.

I for one am happy that I profited on the long end of things.  I really believed in what I was doing, thus why I bought in on the way up the first time, and continued holding.  I had never invested in stocks before.  But I soon realized that the moment had passed, and that losing money wasn't much of a way to make a statement.  So on the way up the second time I cashed out and made small profits.

109,TV," > I think there's two types of people who get on this. Rich(or semi-rich) people who just want to get richer. And poor people who see it as a way out. Hint: usually the former get in early and take the upside, and usually the latter join late and lose.

Interesting. Sounds like the stock market. Bitcoin was created in the year 2008 (technically early 2009) for a reason. The only thing crypto is really missing is overpaid suited-up talking heads on TV telling poor people to buy overpriced shit so that rich people can get richer before the next crash, which will wipe out the people that can least afford to lose their investments. A la 2008.

Crypto (like Doge) is just the stock market, without all the bullshit, and with far better gambling odds. Doge's valuation makes about as much sense as most of the S&P. And at least the financial security of 10s of millions of people aren't riding on Doge's valuation.",1117777111,-2,/r/stocks/comments/ms4niw/the_new_normal_25_of_the_sp_100_companies_are_70/guric3c/,0.106,0.739,0.155,0.8104

169,CPA," Dividends should be irrelevant to the investor holding the shares. It's more of a psychological effect than an economic benefit. In order to pay dividends, an entity must generate profit and cash-flows. The company can either choose to retain those profits on their book value or issue them to the stockholders. When they declare dividends, the market value of an entity decreases to account for the return of capital to shareholders. This is why dividend stocks tend to trade sideways. There is no capital appreciation because all earnings, profits, and cash-flows are being returned to the shareholders every year.

As a Tax CPA, I would even suggest that dividends are detrimental. Mind you, you mentioned a ROTH IRA account so this doesn't really impact you but still hear me out. On traditional taxable accounts, dividends are taxed at capital gains rates (ordinary rates if international). You will be assessed a tax, even if you reinvest those dividends. You would be much better off having the business retain that cash or give it back via buybacks. That way you only get taxed at a capital gain rate when you sell. You should be indifferent between a firm issuing $100M in dividends and the stock price remain constant and a firm not issuing a dividend but have its market value increase because it has retained its cash-flows.

-Solar power does better in summer. Don't think I need to explain that one. Demands for power in the south are WAY up during the summer. Everyone will want to get in ahead of those earnings.

It’s not a pure money play, instead it was based on the schedule and need of his other investments. B. Selling at an ATH would cause more scandal and speculation/mistrust. Or C. It’s a play to benefit incoming traders for an upcoming flight.

Why I don’t think he is exiting a large percentage of his shares soon...because throwing away a space company would be detrimental to his other businesses and reputation, it would be shameful considering how close they are to some sort of success. Also, should it become apparent that VG will not be as fruitful as planned it could just be merged with another Virgin entity as a catalyst to push it forward.

Say i own stock ABC and have 100 shares i bought at various prices from $25-$50. Stock is now at $50 and i want to sell off some stock. 

So say total with those 100 shares im up $1000. 

The way the selling works is that you sell FIFO (First in, first out) right? So no matter what if stocks at $50 id sell my lower shares first because of the way the brokerage is set up?

272,EBS," True and let me explain why.


If you are holding for the long term, the short term movements are scary but are irrevelant. What matters is what kind of earning reports will be out in the future, and the news of the company.


Let me use an example.


I am currently invested in EBS for 5+ years. Wether it moves down or up in the short term is irrevelant. What matters is the actual earnings reports there will be. If they are poor, even if the company went up in the short term, its irrelevant, because the earning reports will tank the stock.


If the company is down in the short term, also irrelevant. If they keep breaking earning records and have good news, it WILL go up eventually.


Short term movements doesn't matter if you are in for the long term. Its only scary because if tons of investors are selling out of it, it makes you wonder if you might have missed some sort of bad news (and that would matter!). Its essentially herd mentality. If you see other fellow EBS investors all selling out of their positions, it makes you think you may have made a mistake. And sure, it would be justified to double check if there isn't a bad news somewhere. But if you see nothing, its probably just the traders playing with the stock, which is irrelevant to us long term investors.",Floofyboy,2,/r/stocks/comments/mrzmk2/rstocks_daily_discussion_fundamentals_friday_apr/gur1l1h/,0.107,0.83,0.063,-0.938

330,ATH," You are taking my reply totally out of context.

We are talking about selling some speculative stocks that are falling, to buy different, solid companies.

Since the market is at all time highs, can make sense to wait for a dip or correction before entering.

You tell what you think is the best alternative for the person I’m replying to. Keep his speculative plays and hope for a rebound? Sell them and buy better companies immediately at ATH?

The “don’t time the market” concept is sometimes applied poorly.

One reason is that it mostly applies if you buy indexes, not individual stocks.
If you invest in stocks, rotations are a form of timing, and widely used with profit. Hedge funds are an extreme example, but not the only one.
If you rode a security up to overvalued, let’s say Tesla, but could be Apple or anything, and the market is ripe for a correction and rotation, let’s say the eventual increase in interest rates, or the recent pattern of indexes, makes perfect sense to rotate to something that’s undervalued.

Also, some great investors don’t seem to believe in this concept of just buying the market regardless of valutations, even at ATH. Warren Buffett has long been sitting on a huge pile of cash, rather just buying an index.

The most prominent promoter of “not timing the market” sold index funds, and that’s where the concept best belongs.

Edit:
I also remember reading on Bloomberg last years of a small fund that achieved a 100% return in a few months, with a strategy they described being All in - All out. They probably were more sophisticated in their analysis of securities and market timing than the typical investor, of course.",year0000,1,/r/stocks/comments/mrzmk2/rstocks_daily_discussion_fundamentals_friday_apr/guq78pn/,0.004,0.821,0.175,0.9945

340,PLTR," Current financials is indeed a weakness, with -0.42 EPS and not a great EBITDA. However, the partial explanation for this is that PLTR is refusing to pander to wall street analysts by focusing on returning profit to shareholders quarterly.

This results in a negative sentiment by analysts, therefore keeping the price lower; which I personally see as a great buying opportunity for 3-5 years+ investment.",athlejm,1,/r/stocks/comments/mrzmk2/rstocks_daily_discussion_fundamentals_friday_apr/guqbg2n/,0.218,0.714,0.069,-0.906

Industry is full of these new ""high tech"" startups claiming they have brand new solid state batteries, or some other magical tech. They don't but people buy into the hype.

For recent example check out QS. They got listed via SPAC (thus didn't undergo normal checks), pumped their stock to $140+ before dumping in to 40's back in Dec/Jan and now short report *claims* they are decades away from producing batteries. Same report claims VW engineers are sceptical of QS but management buys into hype (and has what those engineers called ""tesla envy"").

That is all very open to change in the future. Over the years we have come to see the damaging effects that the mining and collection of oil and gas has to wildlife. Moreover, we can now see the effects that the burning of oil and gas has caused to our environment.

Sorry to sound like Greta Thunberg, but it will get to the point where the Earth becomes uninhabitable. That is why we are beginning to find new, cleaner and greener ways to create electricity that doesn’t damage our environment.

My point? Renewables and other cleaner ways of electricity production are set to take over in the near future. Countries are already attempting to reduce their reliance on oil and gas.

1. PE is suppressed based on prior lawsuit.

2. Fines and escrow accounts regarding the lawsuit has been paid out, so will not affect the bottom line moving forward.

3. Revenues remained constant even when publicity was at its worst through the scandal. Therefore, public sentiment doe not appear to causing them to no longer sell products. This negativity will fade with time and their rebranding efforts.

4. The old CEO has been fired and a new CEO installed. They stopped selling the brand associated with the formaldehyde and they are also divesting out of China. They are also under probation with audits of their actions. These actions will help ensure the company keeps out of trouble moving forward.

1. Solar is a cheaper source of power than natural gas, and will dominate new installations over the next few years.
2. MAXN crushed EPS
3. MAXN generated >$844 million in revenue in 2020, which is currently larger than its market cap ($780 million). Though sales are down from 2019 due to COVID (also note it was the same company as SPWR in 2019, it has recently split off from it)

1. All solar is overvalued
2. Q1 guidance is poor, and they know a lot about Q1
3. 16% dilution of shares

The 16% is the most tangible to me, since MAXN undersells itself on guidance all the time. The question is what is the price point that 16% comes from. Is it $30 a share? $28? $24? These are all share prices from the past two weeks.

For solar in general, I can't help but notice the price action is similar to highly speculative hydrogen stocks that aren't profitable yet.

The 16% is the most tangible to me, since MAXN undersells itself on guidance all the time. The question is what is the price point that 16% comes from. Is it $30 a share? $28? $24? These are all share prices from the past two weeks.

For solar in general, I can't help but notice the price action is similar to highly speculative hydrogen stocks that aren't profitable yet. Perhaps all solar is overvalued, but I think it's more likely they are in the same basket as far less secure companies. The also all have very high short floats (\~25% or so).",Thalesian,7,/r/stocks/comments/mrog5u/opinion_on_maxn/guno907/,0.044,0.894,0.062,0.4402
456,NIO," I bought October $22 calls two days ago. Ugh. While I can't time the bottom, I feel this is pretty close. I'm still hoping I can at least break even at this point. The bid/ask spread is probably so wide that I can't sell. This amount of money that they're raising makes me bullish that they want to rapidly expand. Even the last time NIO had an offering, the stock went back up later that week.

Isn't the dilution about 23.8%?

$125 million offering

$18.75 million for underwriters

~$38 million for the 1.9 million shares to Tianjin Zhonghuan Semiconductor

I would not agree that their moat is minimal. I would say that their microinverters are the defacto standard in the industry. And they've been coupling it with smart software to redirect power into battery charging, grid and home use.

Unfortunately, the home I live in doesn't have great sun to benefit from solar, so I don't have personal experience with Enphase.


Honestly, my biggest worry is that they've run up so fast and aggressively in a short period of time, that they're due for even more pullback.

Their revenue growth is amazing from their 10k:
https://investor.enphase.com/node/18836/html#ib51ac078944f40aabcb529ec51955ccf_487

And their margins are becoming impressive. Their margins have improved from 30% in 2018 to 45% in 2020.  

But does this all justify their PE and PS ratio?

I tend to ignore PE ratios in growing companies because there are so many ways to fuck with the accounting numbers. The PS ratio is okay but also, doesn't take into account margins and profitability.

When I have doubts like this, I like to look at cash flow. The biggest thing that stands out to me in their 2019 to 2020 balance sheet is the increase of their cash position. They've grown their cash position from $251M to $650M. They also have a very low goodwill on their balance sheet which gives me confidence that they aren't propping up their assets with fluff. Unfortunately, in conjunction with their cash position, they also have a huge increase in their debt position from $2M to $325M. 

So maybe this offsets the cash positivity?

Analysts have price targets over 200 on median for ENPH:  https://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=enph

482,AMD," Your portfolio is in SOFI is $4882 with ENPH worth $1955, about 40%. Here's my advice, and a lot of it depends on your income levels and expectations of growth.

Your SOFI account seems like a bit of a ""yolo"" and ""play"" account. In which case, my advice is that you don't spread across multiple stocks. $5000 over your lifetime will be inconsequential if you have steady income, a 401k and a roth IRA.

Before you sell ENPH, you need a plan on where that money will go. Do you believe the market will crash so you'll just keep it in cash? Will you just convert it to VOO until you figure out what to do with it? Do you have any undervalued stocks that would better run than ENPH? What is your time horizon?

If I was you,  ere's what I'd do in your SOFI account. I would find out from ENPH, AMD, ICLN, PLTR and SNAP which one I like the most. Which one has the best valuation and growth potential. I would develop conviction for my decision and consolidate all the money into one of those stocks. Also, be aware that ICLN has about 5% exposure to ENPH.

This is a more high risk/high reward strategy, but honesty, I think it has the best ROI for your goals and objectives.

As for ENPH? I don't know how it stacks up against PLTR and SNAP. I'm not in either. I have been eyeing PLTR for a while, but I don't have enough conviction in it to hold it for 2 years. I think in 2 years it could see 100. But again, I'm not convicted enough to hold through all the choppiness. ENPH has many more analysts giving price targets up in the mid-200's.

The simple relationship between yields and economic recovery doesn't make sense because job and retail data released yesterday was fantastic. Perhaps buyers allocated profits from other investments into bonds, yesterday. The fed is still buying back treasuries and suppressing yields. I am of the opinion that we will not get any meaningful inflation without a significant policy change that increases the income if the bottom 50% of people in the USA whether that is with UBI, increase in minimum wage, or a comprehensive economic overhaul. I don't see that happening, given how divided the USA congress is. Several democrats shot down $15 minimum wage and too few support UBI to pass, despite that it was started under the Republican administration. If the 10yr hits 1.85 and none of the above occur to increase wages, then I'm going to start buying T bonds. Price will go up as yields go back down.

1. Buy 1@100 
2. Buy 1@90 - cost basis 190
3. Sell 2@90 - g/l -10
Now if you do nothing after that no wash sale here. 
If you buy it back next day when price dropped lower to 80
4. Buy 2@80 - cost basis 160
Now wash sale applies. You CANNOT report a loss for -10 on 2020 taxes. Instead you can only apply that -10 loss to your current position. Now your cost basis is 170 instead of 160. When you finally sell it
5. Sell 2@100 - g/l +30

It’s only when you completely exit the position that you may take advantage of that loss you incurred in #1",MindMugging,2,/r/stocks/comments/ms306a/wash_sale_question/guqg5ut/,0.096,0.874,0.03,-0.8871

Since that $13B of value was transferred into real goods, if inflation goes up 10% then the value of those commodities will increase accordingly(and likely at a multiple of inflation).

You are loaning that entity your money during the duration of the bond, and each entity will have a different creditworthiness. The yield of corporate bonds is tied to treasury bonds, since corporate bonds are slightly more risky (risk of default), so they’ll typically have a slight yield premium over the respective treasury bond duration. 

The three year treasury currently has a yield rate of .338% APR, which I don’t think would cover inflation during that duration.
