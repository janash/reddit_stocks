0,GME,"Hey r/all,

Welcome to r/wallstreetbets! (WSB) Aptly described as ""It's like 4chan found a Bloomberg Terminal"".

Long story short, u/DeepFuckingValue (DFV) posted [his GME YOLO here](https://i.redd.it/pvmj76ntgfl31.png) back in September of 2019.

He took an $50K long position and has been long ever since. That's right, he turned $50K into $22MM+. (He has realized gains, which is why his cost basis appears at $770K, see his post history for details)

It's not fake. Look at this submission history.

Welcome to WSB and enjoy your tendies.

The fact that an army of retail Reddit traders is taking profits from the institutional  investors that have used the system to their advantage for decades  should be cheered.  Large investors have systematically driven companies  out of the stock market and sometimes out of business through ""legal""  short selling.

In regards to the trading of GameStop common shares (NYSE ticker: GME) during the trading period of June 30, 2020 through January 26, 2021

As noted by the SEC:
Short sales used to manipulate the price of a stock are generally prohibited.  Some examples of prohibited manipulation include:

engaging in a series of transactions to create actual or apparent active trading in a security; or
depressing the price of a security to induce other investors to purchase or sell the security.
 It is requested that a formal investigation be conducted into order flows and shares sold short during this period for violating SEC rules and regulations.

139,GME,"Here's an ELI5 for you and /u/veepul. Hope this helps! When you buy a call option, you choose some amount of an asset, a price (the strike price), and a time period. At any point during the time period, you can exercise the option and make the prearranged purchase - buying the underlying asset for the strike price. You can also choose not to exercise the option and simply let it expire. Because you are allowed to choose when to exercise the option - if at all - there is a fixed risk. You pay a certain price (the premium) up front for the option, and you can't lose any more money than that.

If you bought one share of GME at $100 hoping it would go up and it instead drops to $50, you've lost $50. If you instead pay $10 for a call option of one share at a strike price of $100, you've only lost $10 no matter how low the price drops. Even if it tanks all the way to a few cents per share, you can just let the option expire and eat the $10 premium.

If GME goes up to $200 instead and you sold, your profit would be $100 if you bought your share straight up. If you instead exercise the option you paid $10 for, you pay the strike price of $100 and your total profit is $90.

Calls let you manage your risk in exchange for reducing your maximum potential profit. They also let you take a position that you can't necessarily afford right now, but might be able to afford at the time you exercise the option. Put options work the same way, but give you the right to sell the underlying asset at some point instead of the right to buy it.",0.059,0.842,0.099,0.9131

Who knows what we will open at tomorrow after seeing what happening in AH but if we see it at around 200ish expect some volatility.

If it opens at 200ish there is a decent chance that another Gamma Squeeze happen. A lot of people are saying we need GME to stay above 115 on Friday ,but the shorts would most likely want to cover now at 200 or so, rather than wait until Friday when GME can be at 300 instead.

Also I know some of you are going to try and be smart and sell GME at 200 or whatever hoping to get back in when it drops. Well a few people tried doing that today when GME hit 150 but missed their re entry point when GME immediately bounced back up.

From my limited understanding, short sellers make money when a stock goes down. In this case, the hedge fund, shorted GME expecting the stock to continue to retract and ? Kind of crippling the company. Along comes WSB, stocks are purchased, and the stock raises in price.. this makes the hedge fund panic, more guys place calls, the hedge fund sells at a higher price and loses money. Causing the stock to go higher, and people cash in their calls... am I close? I would love to know more about the theory of what’s going on.

But they will find a way to adapt a little after they continue to have there yearly profits hammered as bad as they have now.    I expect most firms will become more regimented with how and when they begin to go short.  By law they have to publish there positions and its all available for public lookup.. usually within 45 days to my knowledge.

 Truth be told, the Mob is actually using an old technique, but because of how its being done, we will win with it handily while not getting put in jail.   The major difference is we have the ability to have free speech, and at no point are we actually directly colluding.  (well, some of us probably are, and those folks may get caught).   The major difference is the organisation factor I believe.  If we all were priced in to succeed or fail as a unit, and we worked together how we seem to be now, then for sure we would have problems. But as structured its actually quite legal to my knowledge.  We can suggest stocks, we can buy stocks, we can get together and talk stocks.. but we all have our own free opinion on if we will continue to buy or hold the stock at any given value.   In other words our organisation structure can never be perfectly efficient.

I expect that given a few rounds of loosing a few billion dollars some of them will really wise up and learn to control there positions a little better.  They will likely choose stocks with larger floats, larger market caps, and will likely not bet as much.  This will reduce there profits likely, but it will also create a scenario where they can actually have available capital to fight back in scenarios like today.   Had they not been so greedy and only had say 0.5% nav invested, a stock going up 2500% is actually probably not that bad if the rest of them are playing out according to plan. 

Where this gets really interesting is if we figure out the primary holders of specific funds and then also learn to go long on the not so targeted stocks that are ripe for short squeeze like GME.  It can/would cause a cascade of buying pressure across all of the holdings, not just the GME.  Now its really getting intense and a lot like war.  In other words said said, lets pretend fund X has 5% nav short on GME.  GME rises 400%, and they are all say short stock Y, in theory for them to stay liquid they will have to buy stock Y also.

TL;DR: Wall Street gambled their life savings by betting stock price will go down by 'shorting'. Wall Street was 'tard enough to short like 140% of available shares. When you short, you HAVE to purchase shares at the date the shorts are matured. But what if there's no one selling the stocks. How you going to find those shares? Wall Street is handicapped as long as people just hold the stock and at the day of the 'short squeeze', the stock price can be 4+ figures because Wall Street has to buy at ANY price to get those shares.

Shorting == Lots of money if you are right the stock is going down. However, shorting can result in **negative** INFINITE profit. And... as long as people buy the stock and hold, stock price will just keep climbing. And Wall Street has to pay its dues to the shareholders.

I’ve also been balls deep lately in the research (thanks online college) of what is actually happening right now. I’ve concluded that while there is a “together as one” aspect, at least on social media, the fundamentals of short squeezes are very sound. People saying this is a pump in dump are either ignorant, stupid, or 🌈🐻

I’ve also concluded that a lot of people know how short squeezes work, have understood the DD’s, and have done their own; and a lot of people have no clue what’s going on and just want free money. Wall Street hates the people who don’t know what they’re doing who are still on the right side of this fight.

The short's main option to get out that doesn't involve capitulation to the institutional longs or bankruptcy (both options are probably equally bad, hedge funds should love to kill other hedge funds, and the shorts served themselves on a platter) is to convince retail that shorting GME is free money since it's a dead company and pass a big portion of the gigantic bags they're holding to retail. While the overall short% might not change, if they can get retail to hold their bags then they won't need to capitulate to the other institutions.

The longs are also aware of this so they'll try to get brokers to make margin requirements on GME as strict as possible so retail can't short, but beyond this I'm just an outsider and can't even speculate.",0.047,0.908,0.045,-0.3182

I know that it isn't all that taxes and balancing assets and liabilities, but I want to get into analyst positions, fund management, etc. Granted, depending on how this GME situation plays out, I may never have to work if I don't want to lol.

I'm not from a target, nor am I top of class. I just love investing and learning about money strategies and how investments work. So finance is my path, and I want to get my CFA after graduation as well. I'm really driven in it because I spent about 3 years floundering around in school not quite loving what I was doing. I'm a reformed engineering student, as I like to say. I was doing it because I didn't have anything better to do, and I knew it was a good career, my dad's one, all that. And it didn't help that a lot of the career and personality tests said that I'd be a great engineer lol. And maybe that's true, but calculus is no joke man.

After realizing I hated Calc, and taking a semester break, I took a moment to sit back and think about what I actually liked to do. I had always been intrigued by money and investing, my mom started me as I worked in my teenage years investing in a mutual fund. And I had read a lot and loved it, but it had never clicked to me that I should pursue a career in that. As I spent this time in introspection, it dawned on me, well duh, what kind of careers are there with money and investing. Boom, read all about accounting, econ, finance, and quickly realized that finance was where I needed to be because that aligned with my desires about what I wanted to do.

I’m trying to figure out how to pivot and I might get into tax (formerly audit/do financial accounting rn) so I can do my own solo practice or something and work on my own schedule.

CFA is a bit more difficult than CPA from what I’ve heard and both are pretty massive undertakings. Idk about Finance but most universities have 5-year programs for Accounting majors to get their Masters and I did that.

I can’t comment on finance life but accounting kind of is a lot of boring transactional stuff and I have really strong analytical skills that I feel like I haven’t been using. Granted I’m only 4 years into my career but that’s kind of a bummer for me since analysis is fun for me. However reconciliations and picking apart accounts and finding and resolving differences is its own fun. There’s also forensic accounting for finding fraud and stuff which is cool but I think most career options for that are like FBI and shit and I’m not really into that. But I haven’t looked super deep into that.

I don’t know much about pathways out of school for finance. I think either field is going to have good job prospects since they have skill sets that are in demand for any company and the CFA/CPA makes you instantly desirable. Big 4 is the best route for accounting but is soul sucking. I didn’t do it but I can’t imagine the 70-80 hour weeks for 3 months out of the year.

Melvin and Citadel have access to Robinhood information, and perhaps more on positions, limit sells and most importantly, stop losses. This is because Citadel is the broker to Robinhood. 

Why should you remove them? Because they can manipulate they market down to where the average holder has a stop loss to limit their own losses, as evidenced 10 minutes before close today (didn't work though lol) 

Please montior the stock instead. It may also be wise to remove limit sells, as they can probably use this against you too.

Shorters tried really fuckin hard to keep it below 150 for whatever reason, probaably about options or something. Anyway, Musk tweeted a few minutes after, surely aware of this fight and saw another way to get back at em, and price broke through 150 ezpz afterhours, and now its past 200.

Their initial gimmick was $0 commissions on trades, but you can get that at firms like Fidelity and Schwab now, which you should use over RH for a couple of reasons. 1) execution quality on your trades. RH makes money by taking your order and selling it to the order room that promises to pay them the most for it. This means it takes longer for your trade to fill, costing you money potentially. 2) additional coverage for your assets. In addition to SIPC insurance, bigger firms give you additional insurance. Fidelity uses Lloyds of London. You get way more than $250k in cash and additional $250k in securities this way. Plus they’ve been around for decades, are reputable, and house trillions in assets. They aren’t going to potentially sweat someone suddenly cashing out 6 million. RH? Who fucking knows man.

480,DD,"I think there should be an exit strategy 4: the risk assessor. 

Like, you'ev studied the DD, the public sentiment, you're tuned in from pre-market to after-market. THIS IS IT!

You set conservative, but hopeful, limit sells given the ongoing news and trends. You have a few shares wayyy up there in heaven somewhere, that you are okay holding onto if they don't go. But mostly you're wanting to cover your initial position, and then diamond hands this shit with your moon-bruddas. 

So then you set up sensible intervals. You can set a plan and stick to it hard, or adjust, given the data available. I personally moved mine up a little toward the top given the outstanding short interest and # in play. I KNOW it's going higher...but how high? It'll be a matter of degrees. 

We're helped in the calculating by the halts themselves. If it crashes, you can still get out. If it's INSTANT, that's the shorts, so you wait after the halt for the buy-back. They may trickle it out to fool, so that's why you keep an eye on Short interest. As it lowers, you get tighter, more aggressive and confident. Maybe sell some right away. 

This is the SMART, Risk Assessor play. Will you maximize profit? No. Will you maximize pain? NO. Will you limit risk? Absolutely, but it'll cost you, and you may feel dirty. 

But keep in mind that no matter what happens, you're likely holding something, maybe 20, 30 percent, until it all goes. You lose nothing as you've covered your initial. You, sir/madam, may be a future investor.",0.13,0.696,0.174,0.9478

So after reading all this lengthy posts about it let me break it down for simple redneck autistics.

Gamestop($GME🚀🚀🚀🚀🌕 this way this post is official) has 69,000,000 shares on short.. this means there are 69 muthafuckin million shares that have to be bought within the next month.. A short sell is when someone buys a stock on loan basically.. so they cash out or sell 1000 stocks at current price of $420 each. That's 420k. The plan is that the stock goes down to $69 so that they only have to pay that stock back at that price. The short seller gets to keep the difference... Soo what's happening right now is the stock is going to 69,420🚀 .The short seller buys the stocks they shorted for it's current price before it lands on the moon. They don't want to get stuck paying for a stock that is at $42069 dollars. So as more people buy the stocks go up..

Now gamma squeeze.. gamma squeeze is about the call options.. right now there's something like 150,000 contracts for Friday that every single one is in the money.. so 150,000 contracts of 100 shares each that will all be exercised. That's 15,000,000 shares that will be purchased on Friday..

Now here's the catch.. shorts on gamestop this week are up .22% https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/

These fucking morons are doubling down to try and make there money back... And so long as share holders don't sell. They will be forced to buy in now while they can still afford to.

Soo I'm going all in 10k tomorrow. It's a weak hand. But will probably be 150k on Friday..

I will then monday put 100k in shares and 50k more on calls. Then end of next week my call options could be 1mil Yolo 900k into stocks and 100k into options.

If we all rinse and repeat. We can do this for a couple weeks until all the Bears(that means shorts) buy out there short positions.

This thing literally has the potential to hit $1000 by week end and 10k by end of February. But you have to hold!!! Do it for u/DeepFuckingValue and all the autist who said they're tattoo $GME or WSB logo on there ass.

Tl;Dr I'm a simpleton who has been reading about this for months now.. I was left paper handed because I didn't understand, but tomorrow I am going all in because I understand that there is still a huge short interest to be squeezed in $GME and it will hit 1000 and has the potential to reach 10k.. be strong. Trust the stonks.. we like this stonk..

Ok folks, the time is upon us, market closed at $146 and by the time of writing this the prices of shares are 300 EACH!!

This is insane, but it is important to all newbies who want to make a quick buck to know why everyone is shouting ""HOLD"" and ""DIAMOND HANDS"" and ""DON'T SELL"" all the time.

The fact of the matter is this: When the short squeeze happens, the people who shorted the shares for GME will be FORCED TO BUY AT THE FIRST AVAILABLE PRICE. Once this happens, demand will increase, triggering the next wave of shorters to cover their positions and buy at THE NEXT AVAILABLE PRICE.

Now what I'm going to say next is possibly the most important part of this whole post: WE COLLECTIVELY CONTROL THE PRICES AT WHICH THE SHORT SELLERS HAVE TO BUY THEIR SHARES. That's right, if 100% of people who owned shares in GME right now were to set their limit sells to $1000, then the shorts would be forced to buy at that price to cover their positions. This is why you need to hold, the more people who sell early means the more volatile the market will be. Don't be scared if the market dips, don't be scared if the price increases to $300 and you think it'll drop.

DON'T BE SCARED!! So far we have, as individuals working together towards a common goal, fucked over at least two multi-billion dollar companies who shorted the shares to be greedy and screw over the little man. If you think we will crumble when the share price reaches a measly few hundred pounds you are dead fucking wrong. Buy shares, don't sell them, set your sell limit at $1000, we all win.

So far we have, as individuals working together towards a common goal, fucked over at least two multi-billion dollar companies who shorted the shares to be greedy and screw over the little man. If you think we will crumble when the share price reaches a measly few hundred pounds you are dead fucking wrong. Buy shares, don't sell them, set your sell limit at $1000, we all win.

Ok folks, the time is upon us, market closed at $146 and by the time of writing this the prices of shares are 300 EACH!!

This is insane, but it is important to all newbies who want to make a quick buck to know why everyone is shouting ""HOLD"" and ""DIAMOND HANDS"" and ""DON'T SELL"" all the time.

The fact of the matter is this: When the short squeeze happens, the people who shorted the shares for GME will be FORCED TO BUY AT THE FIRST AVAILABLE PRICE. Once this happens, demand will increase, triggering the next wave of shorters to cover their positions and buy at THE NEXT AVAILABLE PRICE.

🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀

Now what I'm going to say next is possibly the most important part of this whole post: WE COLLECTIVELY CONTROL THE PRICES AT WHICH THE SHORT SELLERS HAVE TO BUY THEIR SHARES. That's right, if 100% of people who owned shares in GME right now were to set their limit sells to $1000, then the shorts would be forced to buy at that price to cover their positions. This is why you need to hold, the more people who sell early means the more volatile the market will be. Don't be scared if the market dips, don't be scared if the price increases to $300 and you think it'll drop.

DON'T BE SCARED!! So far we have, as individuals working together towards a common goal, fucked over at least two multi-billion dollar companies who shorted the shares to be greedy and screw over the little man. If you think we will crumble when the share price reaches a measly few hundred pounds you are dead fucking wrong. Buy shares, don't sell them, set your sell limit at $1000, we all win.

What's going on? I can only come up with 3 possible explanations:


- They actually closed their positions (very unlikely).


- CNBC legitimately misquoted and/or misunderstood Plotkin. He said or meant to say that they closed all other positions yesterday in order to close their GME positions. Maybe CNBC had someone who didn't fully understand the situation call him for comment (possible).


- Plotkin lied to CNBC and they, knowingly or unknowingly, directly quoted him without doing any due diligence or following up. CNBC will run a correction whenever Plotkin can be reached for comment, which will conveniently be after Melvin actually covers their GME positions. And, lucky for him, GME stock will be at a discount due to the CNBC article.


So which is it? I think it's safe to assume that it's the last one. Melvin and other hedge funds will go bankrupt over this unless they can drive the price down enough to cover. And what difference does it make if they lie and manipulate the media and market one last time? What's the SEC going to do? Fine them? It's worth it to them to give it a shot.

666,GME,"they never expire. Shorts have no time value on them (apart  from the daily interest they are paying for it).

Eli5, Melvin borrowed shares that may or may not exist and introduced them into the marketplace hoping the over supply will kill prices. It turns out their thesis was false. and people kept buying up the supply. 

Every day those short shares are on the market, they pay interest based on **that day's closing price**. This is a very important point. because let's assume they were paying 3.6% annually (this number will make more sense soon) when they opened it at $4. And let's assume for simplicity's sake, they only opened 10 short shares. their max profit on those short shares would be if GME went into bankruptcy and they never had to buy those shares back. so they could have made a total of $4/share.

usually, interest assumes there are 360 days in a year, so 3.6% annual interest means they are paying 0.01% interest per day. at $4, they would have been paying 0.04 cents a day per share, or 4cents in interest every 10 days for their total of 10 shares. Again, for these 10 shares, the absolute most they can make is $4/share or $40 if GME goes into bankruptcy (minus the interest they pay).

Now let's assume GME can rally to $400 by close today. For today alone, they will owe 4 cents per share. As you can see, even though the short shares never expire, they start paying hefty fees on them, which will eventually cause them to either decide to keep waiting or finally close.

Technically speaking, if they are willing to pay the exorbitant fees  forever, they could technically hold those short positions forever. So they could try and play a game of chicken and see if we blink first. or just admit defeat and close it early.

Also note that short shares are bought on margin. i.e. you need to prove to your broker that you can actually make them whole again by buying shares back. So if my total assets were only $4k before, and the cost to buy back all those shares now at $400/share is now $4k, my broker could go ""dude, we gave you your chance, even though you can keep paying these fees, you can't afford to buy those shares back at these prices. We aren't going to risk our money so you have to close your position now.""

Finally, his biggest failure of all was his complete and utter inability to acknowledge that every single person who has a brokerage account is aware that what they're doing has risk. I'm not sure about you guys but every brokerage account I've ever opened required numerous pages of ""reading"" about risk and signatures about risk. I'm glad he's so concerned about my risk. It's too bad he wasn't around for Melvin when they lost BILLIONS OF FUCKING DOLLARS shorting 140% of a stock. And then he has the audacity to suggest that retail investors are the ones who will be hurt and implies that we need to be regulated? So long as it doesn't ruin your coiffed hair, give your fucking head a shake. The talking heads wouldn't be off their rocker over GME or whatever other stock getting pumped right now if there weren't hedge funds leveraged to the tits in shorts that they've shorted all the stock and then some. 

Regulation is coming folks and unfortunately it won't be the kind that'll prohibit shorting more stock than exists. It'll consist of taking the tools you and I use every day in order to make some crumbs compared to the institutions on Wall St lest we use those tools ""dangerously"".

1093,GME,"It's definitely not easy at first, but once you understand call options (stock goes up), it makes more sense.


So every call options contract is you paying a premium to buy 100 shares of a stock. The premium is based on a few things, like the price and volatility of the stock. It's also based on how close the stock is to the price you think it will go up to. For example, GameStop premiums right now are the highest I've ever seen like...anything.


So normally it might cost you $2.50x100, so $250, to wager that the price of a stock will go up by $10 by Friday. If it does, you make your $250 back, plus a multiplier of what the stock actually goes to. How high it goes is unlimited, like with what we're seeing with GME.


This is a very basic explanation and definitely don't just go buy options, but that's the idea anyway. And obviously don't buy GME options because right now they're something like $10,000 per contract to bet that the stock will be above $320 on Friday.",0.009,0.896,0.095,0.9455
1094,ALL,"Ah, you seem nice. Basically, options are contracts that deal with 100 shares at a time. Each option has a ""strike price"". For calls, an option is ""In the Money"" or ITM when the current stock price is over the contract's strike price. This is good because it's the contract's intrinsic value.

The difference between an ITM and a ATM/OTM (At The Money/Out Of The Money) option is that it has an intrinsic value. Intrinsic value = underlying price - strike price. This is per stock, so intrinsic per contract needs to be * 100.

So, if I have a $GME contract that I bought with a $500 strike price and the stock goes up to $505, the intrinsic value of the contract (so, above formula * 100) = $500 ([$505 - $500] * 100 = $500).

ALL options (ITM, ATM, OTM) also have extrinsic value. This has to do with volatility and time to maturity. The more volatility, the higher the extrinsic value. This has to do with a contract expiring ITM and deals with Normal Distributions. Time to maturity has to do with how much time is left till expiration.

Why is this important? Well, if I have a $10,000 $GME call and the stock is at $1,000 the day before, then the option is likely to expire OTM even if the volatility is ridiculously high because there's very little time for the stock to fluctuate. If this call expired a month from now, the options price would be much higher as the stock has a much longer amount of time to fluctuate.

This is a very basic start. There are things like the bid/ask of an option, ""the greeks"", what expiry date you should choose (theta decay is a killer), which type of option should I buy (ITM, ATM, OTM), the difference between selling a contract vs selling your buy, et cet. Just do some research on youtube for a start and take notes. Google any questions you have when you start feeling lost - if it don't make sense to you, don't continue learning about options until you've figured out where you might've went wrong.

Hope this was okay. There's a lot to this. I decided to type this out because everyone here can understand the frustration and I don't want you to give up.

Well done,

You’re probably feeling a bit dazed at the moment, buoyed by Elon sending us interstellar, and dreaming of what you’ll buy your wife’s boyfriend to thank him for giving you so much alone time to spend on here.

**Shake out of it!** If you’ve been in this for a while, then you’ve known this always was a high probability outcome, if not inevitable. This is just the next phase of the thesis playing out.

If you just FOMO’d in recently then congratulations and fuck you, and enjoy whatever gains you make from this. This was a massive oversight that went on for weeks and well done for jumping in at the end, so enjoy the ride and whatever you get out of it.

Everything leading up to this was a perfect storm, but also inevitable – you’ve just held strong against wave after wave of misinformation and collusion.

Now comes the tricky part – everyone is wondering where the exit price is. The truth is, as many others have said, no one really knows. This could go 100x higher than anyone even imagines. We are in an unprecedented situation.

So what can YOU do?

1. Stop daydreaming about the future and get serious. Those are UNREALISED gains you’re holding. Now is the time to lock it in. Go knock one out, have a cold shower, get some fresh air away from your computer and then be prepared for a rollercoaster ride over the next few days.
2. Keep an eye out for liquidations of Melvin’s other positions. Set up a couple of alerts to let you know when they’re dropping and that’s when you know it’s go time. The squeeze will not be a 5 minute dump, it will likely take some hours if not days. So when you see it happening, breathe, and wait for your exit calmly.
3. Don’t exit in one go. It’s usually better to exit in tranches – e.g. 20% at $4206.9, 20% at $10,000 etc.  
Unless it hits a milestone that you leaves you financially happy to exit from.  
For me that’s $25,000 per share so I can retire properly and dedicate myself to helping more of you do the same – my moonshot goal.
4. Someone posted a great GME Exit Planner on google docs here a few days ago. If there is an updated version of that, please post it and I’ll link it here. I'll try to find it and upload it - a very useful tool for letting you zoom out and see the big picture.
5. Don’t FOMO – even if you miss the squeeze, it may temporarily drop sub $20, but this is an opportunity. In the long term GME is worth $150+ a share easily. So if you miss it, just hold onto your shares and they will recover.

Share any other advice below and I’ll add the best to this list.

Good luck comrades!

**2) I don't think even a mining permit will prevent them from a good old fashioned gank**
A mining permit never hurts. If the MM had a mining permit last Friday I have no doubt James 315 would have stepped in to bail them out. That's how we roll. The fact of the matter is these shorts aren't interested in rule of law or reality. They tear down HighSec and now they are losing Macks at a rate of a thousand a day. My alts have been on call. I can't even gank enough but they are dropping ORE mods left and right and I am drowning in Catalysts. Seriously. I have like a thousand Catalysts for Friday and there are Bowheads coming in hot with thousands more. I sleep durring down time and multibox a zillion accounts at market open. I can't gank enough. I pretty much hire anyone who sends me a resume. Anyone.

Melvin and Citadel have access to Robinhood information, and perhaps more on positions, limit sells and most importantly, stop losses. This is because Citadel is the broker to Robinhood. 

Why should you remove them? Because they can manipulate they market down to where the average holder has a stop loss to limit their own losses, as evidenced 10 minutes before close today (didn't work though lol) 

Please montior the stock instead. It may also be wise to remove limit sells, as they can probably use this against you too.

Except in reality, just like *The Wolf of Wall Street* said, anyone who says they know what’s going to happen is full of shit and THAT IS STILL TRUE. AND IT APPLIES TO YOU WALL STREET. 

This was their exclusive little club and now the doors are open and we brought the fucking keg. It’s true, no one knows what the market will do, it’s theology more than anything but with a faith in numbers over any book. However, when you are PVP you don’t play the market you play your opponent - and that’s what we’re doing.

Don’t get me wrong. I love GameStop. I just picked up some toys from there. Ryan Cohen is a fucking space alien in business and it’s clear to everyone now. But this is happening because we are PvP, we are attacking exposed enemies and GameStop is the battleground. Like any smart General, you choose where to fight and when to fight and that’s why WE LIKE THE STOCK AND WE LIKE THE COMPANY. 

For years, pro and hardcore gamers have used trackers of all kinds of metric tools to squeeze the last % of optimization out of their abilities. Now, the same information and accessibility is here for stocks and money and you know what? It turns out a lot of people are capable of doing that min maxing, power playing, extreme gaming. Except it’s a real battle and real optimization. 

Now these funds are under attack, it’s PVP and they don’t like it. How dare us commoners seek to attack and then encourage the hordes to do the same with us - not for our gain but for EVERYONES. These people - like a salient in war (position w 3 exposed sides) - left their asses vulnerable out of incredible and revolting hubris. Hubris that has been validated for decades. They say if you swing at the king, you best not miss.

Well guess what fuckfaces? We didn’t! However, they are not and will not take it lying down. Expect waves of lobbying and politicking to come in the near future. They will hit us with everything and they’ve already started, with fake shill accounts and Astro turfing. Make no mistake. This will end up in congress. 

DO NOT BE FOOLED. GAMESTOP. GME. THIS IS PLAYER VS PLAYER COMBAT AND WE ARE WINNING. WHAT YOU SEE FROM THEM IS FEAR, FEAR OF THEIR OWN MORTALITY THAT THEY HAVE EXPOSED OF THEIR OWN VOLITION. MAKE. THEM. PAY. THEY WOULD NOT HESITATE TO DO IT TO YOU.

1489,VS,"This is PVP and that’s why it matters (GME + Irony)

They told us we couldn’t trade because well, they trade and that’s a them thing. Leave it to the experts. 

Except in reality, just like *The Wolf of Wall Street* said, anyone who says they know what’s going to happen is full of shit and THAT IS STILL TRUE. AND IT APPLIES TO YOU WALL STREET. 

This was their exclusive little club and now the doors are open and we brought the fucking keg. It’s true, no one knows what the market will do, it’s theology more than anything but with a faith in numbers over any book. However, when you are PVP you don’t play the market you play your opponent - and that’s what we’re doing.

Don’t get me wrong. I love GameStop. I just picked up some toys from there. Ryan Cohen is a fucking space alien in business and it’s clear to everyone now. But this is happening because we are PvP, we are attacking exposed enemies and GameStop is the battleground. Like any smart General, you choose where to fight and when to fight and that’s why WE LIKE THE STOCK AND WE LIKE THE COMPANY. 

For years, pro and hardcore gamers have used trackers of all kinds of metric tools to squeeze the last % of optimization out of their abilities. Now, the same information and accessibility is here for stocks and money and you know what? It turns out a lot of people are capable of doing that min maxing, power playing, extreme gaming. Except it’s a real battle and real optimization. 

Now these funds are under attack, it’s PVP and they don’t like it. How dare us commoners seek to attack and then encourage the hordes to do the same with us - not for our gain but for EVERYONES. These people - like a salient in war (position w 3 exposed sides) - left their asses vulnerable out of incredible and revolting hubris. Hubris that has been validated for decades. They say if you swing at the king, you best not miss.

Well guess what fuckfaces? We didn’t! However, they are not and will not take it lying down. Expect waves of lobbying and politicking to come in the near future. They will hit us with everything and they’ve already started, with fake shill accounts and Astro turfing. Make no mistake. This will end up in congress.

1627,GME,"Not exactly. That's a vast oversimplification and not at all accurate. 

1) GameStop is a mall retailer
2) General trend is they go under (like Sears)
3) People by default pigeonhole them with Sears and sentiment drops
4) Covid hits and company suffers
5) Wall Street vultures want to kill it off and start shorting it 
6) Stock at $4 and they continue with no regard to actual value... Let alone bankrupting a firm that employs 50.000 
7) Some people (Michael Burry) start running thr actual numbers and see there is some value, they start investing (mid 2019)
8) Few regular joes notice the same thing and find out shorts will continue to fuck with stock and push it down no matter how it is performing. They short it 139%... Sold more shares than there are.
9) For shorts to cover, they need to buy back the shares. They pay interest on the shares they borrowed to immediately sell short. If they start buying back the price goes up.
10) people start buying stock and not letting it be shorted, it drives price a bit up. Hedge funds shorting the company are losing money if they cover so they double down trying to bring the price lower. Mainstream media is giving huge publicity to GME
11) people continue to buy and hold... Hedge losing money so they start selling options at a crazy premium thinking they will shake us off and collect, after stock dives due to their manipulation (Monday was a great example)
12) other funds on wall street smell blood and want in. Short hedge funds caught themselves in their own trap. First the gamma squeez then the short squeez (margin call)
12) they lose 3bn so they get bailed out by their rich friends as not to get margin called.
- until here they could have saved themselves if they flipped-
13) they return the next day and try to repeat. - instead, it backfires and stock keeps shooting up. They are on their knees at market close, about to get margin called ($175 per share)
14) Elon tweets afterhours and it punches up the stock even higher by other wallstreet funds (like BlackRoc)/($220) probably about to wipe that fund and finish some careers.

Good news/bad news with that surgery(not trying to be a downer, sorry).   

The bad: a heads up with that surgery that they don't tell you when you get it done: the dog has a 30-40% chance of blowing the other leg at some point in their life.

The good: the leg you have fixed will NEVER go again. That surgery is rock solid.  I'd do it again and recommend it to anyone in a heartbeat. 

My bosses last dog had both legs go, and he was too old when the second went.  So he had a custom support brace made for like $1000-1200, and saw good success.  But if you ever have to consider that, make sure it's custom made, not a general one.  He's recommended specific braces to a ton of customers and they always seem to find a generic sized one that's 25-35% cheaper than a custom but never fits well enough.  
Look for something that asks for specific measurements(IIRC measurements like: circumference of knee, circ of thigh, height of dog at spine, width leg to leg, etc), a ""dogs 60-85lb"" brace won't cut it for a ligament issue. 

For my dog, I limit rough+tumble play to avoid risk to the other leg.  She tore hers turning after getting the ball during fetch.  So now we play seek games in the yard to keep her active instead of fetch, which is far lower impact.  Worth keeping in mind.

Why should you remove them? Because they can manipulate they market down to where the average holder has a stop loss to limit their own losses, as evidenced 10 minutes before close today (didn't work though lol)

Please montior the stock instead. It may also be wise to remove limit sells, as they can probably use this against you too.

Then one day I realized, if you wanna beat the system, learn their game and fucking beat them at it.  I don't have DFV money, but I had enough in my savings to buy GME and make a difference, albeit a small one.

I graduated from college in 2008 and had to work my ass off to get a job that didn't pay a few bucks over minimum wage.

Due to these events and how everything unfolded, we will most likely never see another event play out like this again. The loses they are taking has already changed their internal business model. A short squeeze can happen again, but not to the levels we will see with GME. 

People like to talk about VW in 08. 08 was a disastrous year altogether and left many pulling $ out of their retirements to stay afloat. This was also when boomers traded stocks on archaic platforms that charged $45 to buy and $45 to sell orders. The market data we see today was not as easily available in 08 either. The average retail investor was not apart of the VW short squeeze. It was more likely these same market manipulators crushing their competitors, getting huge gains, then were still bailed out by the government. (Source: Talking to my retired boomer mom who’s made safe tendies for decades and retired at 50. Even she is in for 100 shares now)

They doubled up, their competitors got bailed out, and everyone else got fucked. They maintained control throughout every catalyst.

This is different. This has been driven up by individual retail investors speculating a short squeeze opportunity on a retailer they bought from for years. For the first time, probably ever, they are no longer still in control. And it’s fucking obvious to see by the way the media, firms, usage of bots, etc they had no foresighted strategy if it were to happen. They’re scrambling hard because they know they lost. 

Moving forward, there will be a plan in place and I doubt we ever see a stock undersold as much as GME is.

If you borrow stock and immediately sell it at $10, committing to buy it back in a month, you're betting on stock going down. If you do that with billions of dollars, you cause it to go down, making it a greedy self-fulfilling prophecy. Now... if you do that, and the stock bumps up to $100, you've lost $90. You've lost 9x more than you played with.

So huge hedge funds were holding enormous amounts of risky short bets and now ""the people"" are making the stock go up 10x, 20x, 30x what it was worth a month ago. Simplified, that means the hedge funds that were betting a billion on GME dropping (and making it drop by doing so) are now losing 10x, 20x, 30x that because they'll be forced to buy all this stock in the end.",0.129,0.823,0.047,-0.9126

This is not a pump and dump or a scam, we are holding because there are market makers who are trying to keep the price down with bets against Gamestop. 
They overextended these bets and if we as a community hold our stocks they need to buy it from us at a high price in the future

The same rich people that caused the market crash in 2007/08 are still in power and continue to manipulate the market to get even richer, we are just taking back our fair share 

Scroll through this subreddit and read the GME endgame posts or other posts marked as ""DD""
They clearly describe the mechanics at work here

Added rockets as requested 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Paper hands - someone who can't hold the stock and sells it out of panic

**GME Is More Than About the Squeeze, It's About An Idea**

As we gearing up for another battle, I honestly believe the story of GME is about more than just triggering the short squeeze, its also a story of the underdog coming up on top, of everyday Davids vs the Goliaths of the financial world. 

Here, let me explain. When this community caught on to the GME trade and started making Melvin, GS, BoA, and now Citadel bleed billions because of their reckless naked short selling, we didn’t just start milking them for every dollar they have; we did something far deadlier. We showed the world that us retail investors are just as capable, or sometimes, even better at identifying market inefficiencies and profiting off of them than the so called “smart money.” That, unlike the billions they could lose in the GME short squeeze, is something they can **never** afford to lose. 

Just think about it. What do **ALL** of these fund managers and institutional investors have in common? What is their schtick? That you, the everyday people, should give them **YOUR** money because they are **SMARTER** than you, **BETTER** investors than you, and **KNOW** what they are doing. We just showed the world that **THAT** sales pitch, is pure bullshit. By screwing over the institutional shorts, we just essentially crashed their party, took a **MASSIVE** dump in their punch bowl, laughed about it, **AND** most importantly, showed the world that we, retail investors, despite having the deck stacked up against us multiple times, can still come out on top due to good, high quality DD and sheer determination. 

Right now, institutions think of us as ants crawling around on the ground. They are not wrong in that regard. As individual ants, we are vulnerable to get crushed by pretty much anything, but when we group together in the thousands, hundreds of thousands, and even millions as we are now, we can tear the entire fucking forest down based on the simple OPINION that WE LIKE THE STOCK. 

Regardless of how this play goes, been an honor lads. Lets get the fucking bread.

The fact of the matter is this: When the short squeeze happens, the people who shorted the shares for GME will be FORCED TO BUY AT THE FIRST AVAILABLE PRICE. Once this happens, demand will increase, triggering the next wave of shorters to cover their positions and buy at THE NEXT AVAILABLE PRICE.

This is why you need to hold, the more people who sell early means the more volatile the market will be. Don't be scared if the market dips, don't be scared if the price increases to $300 and you think it'll drop.

DON'T BE SCARED!! So far we have, as individuals working together towards a common goal, fucked over at least two multi-billion dollar companies who shorted the shares to be greedy and screw over the little man. If you think we will crumble when the share price reaches a measly few hundred pounds you are dead fucking wrong. Buy shares, don't sell them, set your sell limit at $1000, we all win.

1932,RICE,"Ok folks, the time is upon us, market closed at $146 and by the time of writing this the prices of shares are 310 EACH!!

This is insane, but it is important to all newbies who want to make a quick buck to know why everyone is shouting ""HOLD"" and ""DIAMOND HANDS"" and ""DON'T SELL"" all the time.

The fact of the matter is this: When the short squeeze happens, the people who shorted the shares for GME will be FORCED TO BUY AT THE FIRST AVAILABLE PRICE. Once this happens, demand will increase, triggering the next wave of shorters to cover their positions and buy at THE NEXT AVAILABLE PRICE.

🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀

Now what I'm going to say next is possibly the most important part of this whole post: WE COLLECTIVELY CONTROL THE PRICES AT WHICH THE SHORT SELLERS HAVE TO BUY THEIR SHARES. That's right, if 100% of people who owned shares in GME right now were to set their limit sells to $1000, then the shorts would be forced to buy at that price to cover their positions. This is why you need to hold, the more people who sell early means the more volatile the market will be. Don't be scared if the market dips, don't be scared if the price increases to $300 and you think it'll drop.

DON'T BE SCARED!! So far we have, as individuals working together towards a common goal, fucked over at least two multi-billion dollar companies who shorted the shares to be greedy and screw over the little man. If you think we will crumble when the share price reaches a measly few hundred pounds you are dead fucking wrong. Buy shares, don't sell them, set your sell limit at $1000, we all win. (If you want to of course this is not financial advice ;))

(They attacked Robinhood, attacked wsb, attacked reddit. BUY THIS DIP)

So there has been a huge effort on the behalf of the shorts to mislead everyone. There idea is to misdirect. They said they got out of their short positions but the float is STILL 138.4% and the stock only got to 365 in AH where it's easy to manipulate price. For reference, AMC is 36.58%, Telsa is 8%.

GME is 138.4% they doubled down and are trying everyway to distract you to other stocks. My guess would be they are the ones pumping up AMC because they know most Robinhood users can do anything unless they sell their GME positions. They NEED your shares to get out of this jam. If you sell, you give them the ammo to do it. People are asking is the squeeze over? The squeeze didn't even start yet by the look of it.

They want you to run over to some other short positions. They figure if all of us take profits today they will accumulate enough shares to tank it and shake out the weak paper hands giving them more ammo.

If you hold and don't touch your commons. You will be part of the largest squeeze and transfer of wealth in history. The fed caused this by this extra liquidity which allowed greed to run rampant. This isn't our fault they double down and never took profits. The greed that was allowed on their behalf was insane here. 138.4% short. This is life changing money for many of us. Myself included. I could pay off debt, student loans, have money for my kids college.

Diamond hands. Buy every dip.

They are trying to distract you with AMC, BB, BBBY. Telling you the squeeze is over when they actually doubled down. They think we are idiots, let's show them how smart it is to double down against people with very little to lose in comparison to them. Don't worry, they will just get a government bail out and do it again. This is our time people.

That means Short Float IS INCREASING (**250% now**)!

**They can only even borrow 100,000 more shares to short. THEY WILL HAVE TO COVER! The battle is almost won! Don't sell until at least 2/12!**

Isn't it interesting that no one on CNBC is talking about the Gamma Squeeze? I haven't heard a SINGLE mention of it. Yet... that pops off again on Friday! Numbers/Math ain’t capable of lies but PEOPLE and MEDIA certainly are. Hold your nerve!

2027,GME,"After a week of holding, the prices are spiking just as they did every day before. This Friday feels like the beginning of your life. Yesterday the Melvin and CNBC offices were raided for market manipulation. Cramer left those losers and decided to like stocks.

Yesterday you convinced your mom to buy $GME too, and you're excited for her happy retirement.

You feel a little faint, and take a moment to reflect. When you close your eyes, the gates of Valhǫll reveal themselves to you. You enter. There are enormous, armor-clad women with huge breastplates emblazoned with $GME.

Standing in the back, gazing at you approvingly, are Ryan Cohen, DFV, Cramer, and Palihapitiya. Also that weird rabbit mascot gamestop had when we were kids.

All around you is the sound of analogue Gamecube controllers, mid 2000s macho video game commercials, and wives leaving their boyfriends for their husband.

You look down and realize that you, too, are giant. At this point you realize, the floors are made of xbox 360 cases. You look up. The ceiling is PS5s -- but unlike the mortals, they aren't out of reach to you. They are yours. Your power is endless. This isn't Valhǫll -- this is Power to the Players.

You open your eyes, and your shares are suspended before you with a ""sell"" button and a value of $1694.20. Not on your phone -- on the very fabric of the universe. This is your moment. You look down and say ""No, I like the stock💎🙌"" and you ascend to godhood.

That is what we are waiting for. We are still on the mortal plane, but that will not last forever. What will last forever are our deeds, and our 💎🙌

Not financial advice, but this is spiritual advice. $GMEhalla is my religion and this is a blog post to make my friends laugh. This post is the ever-evolving book of $GMEhalla.",0.031,0.882,0.087,0.9574

2098,GME,"**TO EVERYONE READING**

If you're new & fearful of the volatility, don't be. Right now, we're stuck in a positive feedback loop whereby MMs—the issuers of calls—need to purchase GME shares to hedge. This increases the share price which, in turn, leads to more hedging. That's the loop.

It's being accentuated by short sellers—people who bet that the stock would go down in value—biting the bullet and purchasing shares back from the market. This is called a short squeeze.

Because of the overwhelming degree to which GME has been shorted, we are in a unique position where we'll eventually be able to name our price. It could be $1,000 or $10,000, perhaps higher. We know this will happen with near-certainty if the following is true: everybody holds and buys.

$360 is completely arbitrary, because we get to name our price. This could be 80% of the peak or 8% of it—we get to decide. So BUY, BUY, BUY!",0.031,0.888,0.08,0.7959

2149,GME,"After a week of holding, the prices are spiking just as they did every day before. This Friday feels like the beginning of your life. Yesterday the Melvin and CNBC offices were raided for market manipulation. Cramer left those losers and decided to like stocks with us.

You feel a little faint, and take a moment to reflect. When you close your eyes, the gates of Valhǫll reveal themselves to you. You enter. There are enormous, armor-clad women with huge breastplates emblazoned with $GME.

Standing in the back, gazing at you approvingly, are Ryan Cohen, DFV, Cramer, and Palihapitiya. Also that weird rabbit mascot gamestop had when we were kids.

All around you is the sound of analogue Gamecube controllers, mid 2000s macho video game commercials, and wives leaving their boyfriends for their husband.

You look down and realize that you, too, are giant. At this point you realize, the floors are made of xbox 360 cases. You look up. The ceiling is PS5s -- but unlike the mortals, they aren't out of reach to you. They are yours. Your power is endless. This isn't Valhǫll -- this is Power to the Players.

You open your eyes, and your shares are suspended before you with a ""sell"" button and a value of $1694.20. Not on your phone -- on the very fabric of the universe. This is your moment. You look down and say ""No, I like the stock💎🙌"" and you ascend to godhood.

That is what we are waiting for. We are still on the mortal plane, but that will not last forever. What will last forever are our deeds, and our 💎🙌

HYPOTHETICAL STONK HAS TO CLOSE ABOVE $120 TO START THE MASIVE SHORT SQUEEZE, AND HAS TO CLOSE ABOVE $150 TO GET EXPLOSIVE GROWTH.

Listen. $120 was the intraday high from Monday. $150 was the intraday high from Tuesday. We know that short sellers ENTERED NEW POSITIONS, replacing the old shorts who burnt out. That means that almost 100% of them are ALREADY IN A MARGIN CALL as of EOD Tuesday. But their positions haven't been liquidated yet to cover the margin call. Some brokers allow a few days before liquidation, 2-5 days is typical. The only short squeeze we've seen are from before last Friday. The After-Hours explosion from $148 to $220 on Tuesday was AH liquidation of MONDAY margin callers. Essentially, the unlucky fools who shorted under the Monday EOD price of $76.79 (there was a intraday low of $69).

That means if the stock HOLDS above $120 at EOD Wednesday (all the Monday shorts) we'll trigger a wave of margin call LIQUIDATION (ie., the squeeze) from Monday shorts, and if it holds above $150 (all the Tuesday shorts) we'll trigger a MORE massive wave of margin call liquidation, which will take place AH Wednesday, today. The real squeeze will BEGIN.

SO 💎 🤲 AT ALL COSTS. GME NEEDS TO BE ABOVE $150.

Again this is purely a work of fiction. I don't even know what I'm doing on Reddit, mostly I just smash the keyboard together and sometimes words come out. I'm not even sure if I'm putting together a coherent sentence right now, so this absolutely cannot and should not be construed as investment advice.

Some brokers allow a few days before liquidation, 2-5 days is typical. The only short squeeze we've seen are from before last Friday. The After-Hours explosion from $148 to $220 on Tuesday was AH liquidation of MONDAY margin callers. Essentially, the unlucky fools who shorted under the Monday EOD price of $76.79 (there was a intraday low of $69).

That means if the stock HOLDS above $120 at EOD Wednesday (all the Monday shorts) we'll trigger a wave of margin call LIQUIDATION (ie., the squeeze) from Monday shorts, and if it holds above $150 (all the Tuesday shorts) we'll trigger a MORE massive wave of margin call liquidation, which will take place AH Wednesday, today. The real squeeze will BEGIN.

SO 💎 🤲 AT ALL COSTS. GME NEEDS TO BE ABOVE $150.

2412,DD,"This is a great idea as a social experiment. But it goes again the value of WSB. WSB is the true democratization of investing. Hear me out:

Normally, Wall Street hires analysts. These analysts conduct equity research. They turn the equity research into their bosses who make the big brain investing decisions. Traders time the investment. Wall Street makes profit, evades taxes, fucks over every day people, and sleep in their Yachts. All of them are motivated by winning forever.

WSB is the antithesis of this. There are no analysts, only Autists. These Autists do DD for free, sharing it for all to benefit. WSB retards decide which DD to follow and time their own trades. These retards don’t come from privilege, they have no yachts, and they only want to make enough so they can FIRE. They pay taxes, and donate to charity. 

Where Wall Street funds (micro or otherwise) seek to make money from money almost as a way to keep score of who’s winning, WSB retards seek only to make enough to FIRE.

You could turn it into a reality TV show.  Split them up into two groupings of 50.  Each week, the teams with the lowest balance from each side get some sort of boost to help them stay afloat.  Maybe they get to combine their balance and acquire a fund of their choosing, poaching the player and their portfolio.  But then they have to work together as a team to run the fund.  Players can be offered buyouts from the funds money.  Each week funds with more than 1 player will have a 'my best move' - each person flags an individual move they make and at the end of the week, if theirs shows the lowest return, can be voted out of the fund.  Other teams have a chance to pick up that player, or their time on the show comes to an end. As the season progresses, there will be shakeups.  Opportunities to do blind swaps of assets with other teams, blind options exchanges, etc.   Pure chaos.  

At the end of the season, you're down to one fund from each side.  They then have to yolo every dollar they made during the season to date into an option that's one month 'til expiration.  Check back in 31 days and the  fund that did better can liquidate their account and take the winnings, or the producers keep the fund but set them up with a proper LLC investment firm - office space, infrastructure, the whole nine.  Players can take their cut of the money if they don't want to go on to form the firm with others, and will also get a [Delorean](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a35297574/replica-delorean-nhtsa-rules/) with 15K of cash in a briefcase in the trunk

2502,AM,"While people are right that you can generally just feel it, you can also see it in the data. If you use Robinhood, go to gme and expand the graph. There's an option top left to add more data, and turn on ""Order Book"". You'll see a bunch of dollar amounts for the share prices, and the number of limit orders for a given amount. Today, 149.99 and 150 had tens of thousands of orders on them. Every time the stock touched those numbers, it would trigger sells and we'd dip down a bit. Rinse and repeat until we were able to burn enough of those/get a big enough inflow of buying to push past it. Some of it is the retail investors just wanting to bail at a certain price, a lot of it are the hedge funds intentionally setting up ""walls"" to try and stall/stop the price from going over a certain amount. Longer they delay it, the more people get anxious, and the more people will shit themselves and sell. (Don't be one of these people. Knowledge is power.

2545,GME,"This comment is specifically for those of you who are like me and have been too scared. Look I'm new here. I own a construction business, I've been to jail, I used to sell drugs, I was 4.0 student and have yoloed my whole life basically. But I have never been more confident about a YOLO as I am right now. I'm going all-in on $GME tomorrow. I have been following all this $GME for two months. But I've been a paper handed autist this whole time.. Mostly because I didn't understand what is happening or could. I've had to read a shit ton of posts to finally come to understand this is the way.. So after reading all this lengthy posts about it let me break it down for simple redneck autistics.

Gamestop($GME🚀🚀🚀🚀🌕 this way this post is official) has 69,000,000 shares on short.. this means there are 69 muthafuckin million shares that have to be bought within the next month.. A short sell is when someone buys a stock on loan basically.. so they cash out or sell 1000 stocks at current price of $420 each. That's 420k. The plan is that the stock goes down to $69 so that they only have to pay that stock back at that price. The short seller gets to keep the difference... Soo what's happening right now is the stock is going to 69,420🚀 .The short seller buys the stocks they shorted for it's current price before it lands on the moon. They don't want to get stuck paying for a stock that is at $42069 dollars. So as more people buy the stocks go up..

Now gamma squeeze.. gamma squeeze is about the call options.. right now there's something like 150,000 contracts for Friday that every single one is in the money.. so 150,000 contracts of 100 shares each that will all be exercised. That's 15,000,000 shares that will be purchased on Friday..

Now here's the catch.. shorts on gamestop this week are up .22% https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/

These fucking morons are doubling down to try and make there money back... And so long as share holders don't sell. They will be forced to buy in now while they can still afford to. 

Soo I'm going all in 10k tomorrow. It's a weak hand. But will probably be 150k on Friday..

 I will then monday put 100k in shares and 50k more on calls. 
Then end of next week my call options could be 1mil
Yolo 900k into stocks and 100k into options.


If we all rinse and repeat. We can do this for a couple weeks until all the Bears(that means shorts) buy out there short positions.

This thing literally has the potential to hit $1000 by week end and 10k by end of February. But you have to hold!!! Do it for u/DeepFuckingValue and all the autist who said they're tattoo $GME or WSB logo on there ass.

Tl;Dr I'm a simpleton who has been reading about this for months now.. I was left paper handed because I didn't understand, but tomorrow I am going all in because I understand that there is still a huge short interest to be squeezed in $GME and it will hit 1000 and has the potential to reach 10k.. be strong. Trust the stonks.. we like this stonk..

2579,AM,"I'm more than happy to help you out with this man, but we'll have to run through some things first. Before we get started, know that this is not financial advice. You do what is best for your money, and you should do your own research on GameStop or any stock before buying shares or calls.

**GME is rising because of bullish signs from a board shakeup, gamma squeezes, and the mother of all short squeezes.** This means that volitility is quite high, and price will fluctuate. The shorters of GameStop had shirted 140% of the company, which is just insane to do anyways. This means that there is a legitimate possiblity that the stock price can reach not just $1,000 a share, but may be able to surpass $10,000 a share. All that is required for this to happen is for current GME shareholders to hold their stocks, and buy the dips when they can. This leads me to the next point, the stock price increase.

As the farmers in my area used to say, the best time to start was yesterday. Same applies here, but that does not mean it is too late to hop on in the rocket ship. Yesterday was a great day, but there was some rumblings about the stock dipping. I believe it will dip because of how fast it has climbed in just 24 hours, but it is not a crash or crashing. Yesterday, there were multiple sell walls encountered, but we overcame them with ease. Why? Because we held onto our stocks and did not sell. Remember this, short sellers must purchase the stock, because the float % they have is to high and are missing their shirt target by a landslide at this point. But how far will it dip today?

What we saw on Monday was a drop in price if about 50% but we still ended the day with 10-11% gain on the stock. We were in a euphoric state when it reached $155, and we're a bit crushed when it hit $69.76 at it's lowest point. It is safe to say that the stock will shoot up early this morning, as the European countries and other markets have done their moves for today. GameStoo is currently hovering at $252 a share right now, and I could sell it all and pay for grad school and some small projects I have been meaning to start or complete; however, I am not selling the stock, not am I sweating any dip.

Some say we may dip all the back to $80 per share, while others think the dip won't go past $150. This may sound like a great idea to wait for the stock to dip to buy an even larger portion of shares, but yesterday showed us that the dip may only be there for an hour. We got off to a quick high of $96, and then we slumped down to $83 at our lowest point. A $13 difference that was eventually surpassed before noon. So how does this impact your buying decision?

It means that you have three choices:


* Buy the stock at open.
* Buy the stock around 10 AM EST for a possible dip.
* Don't buy the stock, because this is not financial advice.

If you decide to buy, then just know that you have not lost a pennies worth of your money until you sell. Indicator's are pointing to a high 4-digit to low 5-digit price per share if we hold, so keep that in mind when you see the stock you have dip. The people who bought at $150 are now in the money, and I expect those who will buy at open will also end the day near or above their purchase line. So do not feel discouraged about it dipping, because the shorts will have to cover in a shirt squeeze eventually, and we are expecting another BIG Gama Squeeze this Friday. Be patient, calm, and you can probably set a sell limit for $10,000. I know I have, but that brings us to our final point.

Remember, this is not financial advice. I really do just like the stock, and the recent higher up changes made within the company itself. The short squeeze is something that is just an added bonus onto the cake here, and we may not encounter much of a dip today with Elon Musk and other people talking about the stock. If you do buy, then stay strong and hold. There may not be another GameStop scenario for a long time. Good luck with your investments my man, and have a great day!

* QQQ &/or QQQJ - Stubborn ETF that just keeps on trucking. Love that little guy.
* AMC - This short squeeze is leading the market to look for other possible squeezes. Why? Because if FOMO and opportunity. Some feel like they missed the GME rocket, so they look for the next possible prey. I just like AMC, as I believe movie theaters will return strong after 2021.
* BB - BlackBerry is back, but it's different too! They are becoming more of a tech and software company, and sold a lot of their old business to other companies. They are also in a short squeeze scenario, but it's interesting to me because of their CEO and new company direction. I just like the stock.
* Steel Market - Steel is mirroring 2008 prices and demand, but the stocks are going south. Steel was my first play of the year, and I sold out for GME. Got tired of losing my money, and decided to YOLO it all in one stock. It has paid off quite well so far, but it's far from over yet.

I cannot lie to you my man, but I have no idea what is or is not available on the Australian stick market. Here are plays I am looking at getting into after GME, but not this is NOT FINANCIAL ADVISE!!! These are just companies, ETF's, and stocks that I really like.

* ICLN - ETF that I was in at $28 for a option call expiring on April 2020 and January 2021. Sold out to go all in on GME.
* QQQ &/or QQQJ - Stubborn ETF that just keeps on trucking. Love that little guy.
* AMC - This short squeeze is leading the market to look for other possible squeezes. Why? Because if FOMO and opportunity. Some feel like they missed the GME rocket, so they look for the next possible prey. I just like AMC, as I believe movie theaters will return strong after 2021.
* BB - BlackBerry is back, but it's different too! They are becoming more of a tech and software company, and sold a lot of their old business to other companies. They are also in a short squeeze scenario, but it's interesting to me because of their CEO and new company direction. I just like the stock.
* Steel Market - Steel is mirroring 2008 prices and demand, but the stocks are going south. Steel was my first play of the year, and I sold out for GME. Got tired of losing my money, and decided to YOLO it all in one stock. It has paid off quite well so far, but it's far from over yet. 

I hope this helps answer your questions, but remember that this is **NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE!** I'm just a dude from nowhere Dakota, who likes some stocks. Good luck with your investments, and see you on Pluto!

To me that speaks to the institutions being too willing to use their size to insulate themselves from ever being wrong, which is not something you want happening in an open market.

Citadel Capital is the hedge fund that bailed out Melvin and honestly they don’t really do crazy manipulation. I know people who worked there and they were mostly just doing boring shit like going long TSMC just with fuckload of leverage.

In this case Citadel Securities fucked up by letting Melvin do lots of dumbass shit and I’m guessing they pushed their sister company to bail out Melvin.

2779,RH,"Basically what the poster is suggesting is that Citadel could conceivably using your Robinhood order data combined with high-speed trading computers running off algorithms to make lightning quick auto-trades based on your Robinhood orders to profit off of them, e.g. by quickly making their own trade that would skim a few pennies off the price you are getting in your Robinhood order. It won't make much difference to you but if they did it for every single Robinhood trade the money will add up, sort of like the scam in Office Space. Note that no one can actually prove that Citadel is actually doing this, and if they were it would I think probably be illegal, but the poster is suggesting they could theoretically be doing this with the RH data.

They have it all already. They were born with a silver spoon and have committed to growing it to a ladle. Never having to worry about payment, costs of living, affording luxuries that we the people can only dream of. Yet they take the other side of this trade.

Estimated losses for the shorts with GME at 120 were 8 billion

It's now at 226.  That's what?  29?  31 billion?  The math is really complicated at these levels.  It's never been seen before so quickly.

They  fought like hell to hold the $150 line all day.  That was where they  drew the line in the sand.  Which tells us that that's the level at  which these guys were risking margin call.

The  news broke today that, in an effort to stem the bleeding, Melvin was  cutting his shorts with a battery maker and a pharma company (Vartas  and...I can't think of the other one) that were dragging him down....but  that he was keeping the GME shorts.

Probably out of a personal vendetta.

That 2.7 dollars he just got lifelined?  It's fucking gone.  It lasted one fucking day.

Which means, if we took him out....we probably took at least 1, probably 3 or 4, other smaller funds out with him.

No, you will have diamond hands. Diamond fucking hands you noob.

Don't let the media sway you from your diamond hands. The shorts are fucked and it's THEIR FAULT. They could've exited their position months ago but they decided to keep making money from bankrupting GameStop. The only people who feel sorry for them are the media who have a vetted interest in painting a false narrative to sell news and protect their money. This is our kick to their teeth. This is where we stand up to all the rich fucks who take glory in bankrupting companies just for their own materialistic gain.

Bottom line is, they shorted a stock and made millions, and kept shorting it to the point of near bankruptcy. Their greed blinded their vision and now they find themselves with a stick up their ass.

Don't let the media sway you from your diamond hands. The shorts are fucked and it's THEIR FAULT. They could've exited their position months ago but they decided to keep making money from bankrupting GameStop. The only people who feel sorry for them are the media who have a vetted interest in painting a false narrative to sell news and protect their money. This is our kick to their teeth. This is where we stand up to all the rich fucks who take glory in bankrupting companies just for their own materialistic gain.

Bottom line is, they shorted a stock and made millions, and kept shorting it to the point of near bankruptcy. Their greed blinded their vision and now they find themselves with a stick up their ass.

Don't let the media sway you from your diamond hands. The shorts are so deep in the hole and it's THEIR FAULT. They could've exited their position months ago but they decided to keep making money from bankrupting GameStop. The only people who feel sorry for them are the media who have a vetted interest in painting a false narrative to sell news and protect their money. This is our kick to their teeth. This is where we stand up to all the rich who take glory in bankrupting companies just for their own materialistic gain.

Bottom line is, they shorted a stock and made millions, and kept shorting it to the point of near bankruptcy. Their greed blinded their vision and now they find themselves with a stick up their ass.

Why should you remove them? Because they can manipulate they market down to where the average holder has a stop loss to limit their own losses, as evidenced 10 minutes before close today (didn't work though lol)

Please montior the stock instead. It may also be wise to remove limit sells, as they can probably use this against you too.

It turns out you’re not red-green colorblind, it turns out your hands are solid diamond, it turns out if you post enough 🚀🚀🚀, Elon will fucking [look](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1354174279894642703?s=20).

We’ve heard for a year now that these times are ‘unprecedented’ and it’s true but now we are on the cusp of completely shattering any future expectation of precedence. The scientists who developed these vaccines to give us autism could never have imagined what weaponized autism could do to their beloved hedgies. Now as we prepare to pen our names in the history books with the ink of Melvin’s tears, please consider why you’re here.

Are you here to flex your papyrus metacarpi with a measely +911% return, only for Melvin to ride out of this to short another day?

Are you here to bow down to Citadel and prove to them that they still have total control over our market?

Are you here to make a few bucks to allow your wife’s boyfriend to get his asshole bleached?

… or, are you here to show all the wall street 🌈🐻 that when we 🚀🚀🚀, we fucking  🚀🚀🚀. We’re not a Kim Jung Un pipe dream, we’re fucking SpaceX.

Look back at your Robinhood portfolio, or maybe your eyes never left. You may be looking at more money than your wife’s boyfriend net worth but don’t forget the reason for that. Know that what you’re doing is bigger than that green number you see. You, me, and all of the other beautiful autists are relying on each other to get to the Moon and do the other things not because they are easy but because they are hard! What we do in this moment will bring on a new era of trading. Our gains will not stop with GME, for the new era where We The People decide value is upon us. We will prove Big Money isn’t big enough or long enough to silence us. We are in the throes of a modern day Wall Street Tea Party, make our forefathers proud. 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸

In less than 12 hours, autists from here will join others from around the world. And you will be launching the largest financial battle in this history of retail investing.

Retail -- that word should have new meaning for all of us today.

We can't be consumed by our petty individual losses anymore.

We will be united in our common interest. WE LIKE THE STOCK.

Perhaps its fate that today is the day chicken tenders were invented, and you will once again be fighting for your tendies, not from tyranny, persecution, or annihilation -- but from oppression.

We're fighting for our right to 🚀, to exist.

And should we win this fight, the 29th of January will no longer be known as another day, but as the day when the autists declared in one voice:

 GME is in a infinite short/gamma squeeze with no way out until you get enough sellers at a certain price. It's a loop that only occurs once in a lifetime, and after this new guidelines will be written. So follow along. there is a float of 47 million shares. Cohen bought 13% and had the option of 20% which the float hasn't been adjusted. so lets say he owns 14 million shares because shares outstanding 70 million. Ok so the float is 34 million and this is the number to base everything off. The total shares short when last listed were 70 million. Then you have 2 million CALLS deep IN THE MONEY this is important. The 2 million CALLS represent 200 million shares and if the float is only 34 million then the CALL sellers are net short 166 million followed by the other 70 million shares which gets you at 236 million shares net short. So it's like a spring coil every time the stock goes up the CALL sellers need to delta hedge or buy shares to off set their CALLS, but they can't because really only 34 million available shares. So the stock goes up, CALL buyers buy even more shares, shorts cover some because price rockets. Then the price goes really high the longs decide to sell to lock in some gains causing the stock to go back down, but then when it drops the shorts start covering more causing it to go back up and the CALL Sellers are still way off on the delta hedge. This spring is in a infinite loop causing it to go higher and higher. The only way out because there is not enough shares to buy, is for the price to rise to such a level that people sell in mass. This won't stop until 3 things happen, and all three will cause the price so much higher than right now. 1st they can't short this and they need to cover in mass. 2nd they need to buy back these CALLS in mass and I mean maybe 200K total CALLS outstanding. 3rd they need to drop the short float to like 10-12 million or 30% or below. Lastly they need so many sellers and I mean like millions of people selling. The only way this stops is if everything comes to fruition, but the price is going to be SO much higher than now for these to happen.

Don't let the media sway you from your diamond hands. The shorts are so deep in the hole and it's THEIR FAULT. They could've exited their position months ago but they decided to keep making money from bankrupting GameStop. The only people who feel sorry for them are the media who have a vetted interest in painting a false narrative to sell news and protect their money. This is our kick to their teeth. This is where we stand up to all the rich who take glory in bankrupting companies just for their own materialistic gain.

Bottom line is, they shorted a stock and made millions, and kept shorting it to the point of near bankruptcy. Their greed blinded their vision and now they find themselves with a stick up their ass.

2) Yes, hold your shares even when you see the stock dip like mad tomorrow - it's pretty much guaranteed to happen since the shorts will be dead if they allow the stock to remain at this price.

3) No, this is not financial advice. Do your own research and take the time to understand why this GME trade might be the best thing the world has seen since sliced bread.

As for me? All in on GME at 1281 shares. The fact that market makers are fighting so desperately to drop the share price should tell you that they're feeling the pressure.

Where were all the mainstream news outlets when GameStop was at the brink of complete demise? Nobody cared. But now that the rich are suffering losses, it’s not okay and retail investors who believe in a company are the enemy?

Don't let the media sway you from your diamond hands. The shorts are so deep in the hole and it's THEIR FAULT. They could've exited their position many months ago but they decided to keep making money from actively shorting GameStop in hopes of it going bankrupt. The only people who feel sorry for them are the media who have a vetted interest in painting a false narrative to sell news and protect their money. This is our kick to their teeth. This is where we stand up to all the rich who take glory in bankrupting companies just for their own materialistic gain.

GameStop is a company that employs thousands of individuals who provide for their families. Why is it okay for a firm or hedge fund to bankrupt a company without any repercussion? Where were all the mainstream news outlets when GameStop was at the brink of complete demise? Nobody cared. But now that the rich are suffering losses, it’s not okay and retail investors who believe in a company are the enemy?

Bottom line is, they shorted a stock and made millions, and kept shorting it to the point of near bankruptcy. Their greed blinded their vision and now they find themselves with a stick up their ass.

HOLD AND BUY THE DIPS. THIS IS FAR FROM OVER.

So if you ever see a stock like GME a few weeks ago (or today) and think it’s undervalued then you don’t believe in the efficient market hypothesis. And you shouldn’t because clearly the price isn’t just some unbiased measure of value because it can be manipulated by things that have nothing to do with value like for instance massive players having tons of short interest and using market mechanics to hold the stock price down, or a short squeeze causing a rapid upward change in stock price.

3304,GME,"Partly yes. And also sheer and utter panic. The valuation of the stock is based on what? Not the financial statements, but rather Autists talking about buying lol and then things go crazy and the non-wsb’ers sell everything they have to buy in or to cover shorts. Then Elon tweets and it gets even nuttier. In the end, it’s obviously a runaway bubble. Now how big and high that bubble goes is anyone’s guess, but like all bubbles, there’s an end. There always is. It might be $GME at $3,000 or something even more insane than that. And it is insane. 

If you want a historical comparison look at the Dutch tulip craze in the 17th century. People were paying insane amounts for tulips. Then everyone panicked and decided they didn’t want tulips and the price fell to nearly nothing within a year. The entire tulip market collapsed in on itself. So the entire market could go supernova on itself and I would laugh my arse off of that happened.

We are owed this and more after all these leeches have done to ensure we are kept under their boots. They use the media to vilify us because we are crawling our way out, we, the lowly retail trader and are beating them at their own game.

If you're new & fearful of the volatility, don't be. Right now, we're stuck in a positive feedback loop whereby MMs—the issuers of calls—need to purchase GME shares to hedge. This increases the share price which, in turn, leads to more hedging. That's the loop.

It's being accentuated by short sellers—people who bet that the stock would go down in value—biting the bullet and purchasing shares back from the market. This is called a short squeeze.

Because of the overwhelming degree to which GME has been shorted, we are in a unique position where we'll eventually be able to name our price. It could be $1,000 or $10,000, perhaps higher. We know this will happen with near-certainty if the following is true: everybody holds and buys.

$360 is completely arbitrary, because we get to name our price. This could be 80% of the peak or 8% of it—we get to decide. So BUY, BUY, BUY!",0.031,0.888,0.08,0.7959

3455,GME,"PSA: if you sell any of your GME today, you will sell your self respect and your dignity with it.

Remember what these sniveling criminals did to you and your family in 2008. They broke the law and bankrupted your parents, evicted them from their homes, and laughed all the way to the bank while the federal government gave them trillions of your family's tax dollars no questions asked. What they couldn't get from taxes they printed off the fed, torching your family's pensions, retirement, and inflating what little cash they stored away to the point where it was worthless.

The same people are still pulling the strings, having faced no real consequences for what they've done. The government and the SEC continue to protect them as they manipulate the markets and make themselves even richer off the broken backs of filthy working class citizens like me.

Despite what CNBC wants you to think, we have every scumbag hedge fund and insuring central bank by the balls right now and we may never get another chance to punish these criminals for their scumbag practices in our lifetimes. This is it. Whatever money you spend and may possibly lose will be the most worthwhile money you will ever spend in your lifetime. If you're too young understand that right now that's okay, but I guarantee some day you will.

Melvin and the other short sellers have not closed their positions, that’s bullshit to calm investors and get us out of the stock. They’re betting on it collapsing before Friday. If it doesn’t, they’ll be forced to buy shares and push it even higher. *That* is $$$ time, don’t fall for this dip, buy in and double down. Nobody is selling, we’re just buying more. Don’t forget this when GME obliterates 500 and you’re thinking “damn, if only I knew..” You DO know. The short sellers have nowhere to go, we’ve got this. The only way we fail is if people back out.

TLDR:BUY CASH, REMIND BROKER DON'T LEND SHARE, DONT GET CAUGHT ON STOP LOSS AND LOW TP, SELL AT LEAST 4 DIGIT TP

1.When you buy stocks on margin or leverage, you create a share for your broker to lend to these short sellers. **So please buy by cash**, so they won't be able to short anymore.Short meaning they push the price down. Those of use in the long position(we want it to go up) don't want that. Also please **remind your broker you dont want to lend shares, so that your broker don't lend them**

2.The short sellers are going to attack and attack and attack by borrowing shares from their broker and sell it with the hopes of pushing price down. So we **HOLD THE FORT**. If you set a stop loss say 10%, and when the short sellers push the price down and your broker auto sell your share, you lost the share and you let the short cover and close their position. Some of you may chicken out because you'll be like ""omg its dropping 10% i got to sell"" Then you are providing them ammunition.

3.OK , so when the short sellers borrow stocks from the broker, the broker charges them interest. So the longer they have a short position and don't close it the more interest their broker charge them. And when the price of stock rise, they lose more money. So the aim here is make them pay more interest and keep pushing the price up so they have a -'ve position until they get have to close their position. **In order for the short sellers to close their position they have to buy the stock from us.**

4. Since there are more or less 140% share sold short, that means that in order to cover/close their position they have to buy they have to buy from us who hold the shares. So If we don't sell or set a high price, **they will have to buy from us at whatever price we please then the stock price will go up.**

5. So What price should you sell? I **won't be selling until it reached 4 digit at least.**

I looked at AMC, around late December when it was in the news. It was classed as a gamble that might go bankrupt or might survive. I remember thinking at $2.something a stock it might double over the year if it survived, and if it bankrupts I’d have only invested around £1k so hopefully my “stable” investment would have covered it. 

In the end I didn’t buy.. and went long on another company which has seen shares drop by over 90% simply because that companies previous high was quite high and I thought when the pandemic is over it would have a better chance of recovering.

*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor and know nothing yadda yadda...*

Well done,

You’re probably feeling a bit dazed at the moment, buoyed by Elon sending us interstellar, and dreaming of what you’ll buy your wife’s boyfriend to thank him for giving you so much alone time to spend on here.

**Shake out of it!** If you’ve been in this for a while, then you’ve known this always was a high probability outcome, if not inevitable. This is just the next phase of the thesis playing out.

If you just FOMO’d in recently then congratulations and fuck you, and enjoy whatever gains you make from this. This was a massive oversight that went on for weeks and well done for jumping in at the end, so enjoy the ride and whatever you get out of it.

Everything leading up to this was a perfect storm, but also inevitable – you’ve just held strong against wave after wave of misinformation and collusion.

Now comes the tricky part – everyone is wondering where the exit price is. The truth is, as many others have said, no one really knows. This could go 100x higher than anyone even imagines. We are in an unprecedented situation.

So what can YOU do?

1. Stop daydreaming about the future and get serious. Those are UNREALISED gains you’re holding. Now is the time to lock it in. Go knock one out, have a cold shower, get some fresh air away from your computer and then be prepared for a rollercoaster ride over the next few days.
2. Keep an eye out for liquidations of Melvin’s other positions. Set up a couple of alerts to let you know when they’re dropping and that’s when you know it’s go time. The squeeze will not be a 5 minute dump, it will likely take some hours if not days. So when you see it happening, breathe, and wait for your exit calmly.
3. Don’t exit in one go. It’s usually better to exit in tranches – e.g. 20% at $4206.9, 20% at $10,000 etc.  
Unless it hits a milestone that you leaves you financially happy to exit from.  
For me that’s $25,000 per share so I can retire properly and dedicate myself to helping more of you do the same – my moonshot goal.
4. Someone posted a great GME Exit Planner on google docs here a few days ago. If there is an updated version of that, please post it and I’ll link it here. I'll try to find it and upload it - a very useful tool for letting you zoom out and see the big picture.
5. Don’t FOMO – even if you miss the squeeze, it may temporarily drop sub $20, but this is an opportunity. In the long term GME is worth $150+ a share easily. So if you miss it, just hold onto your shares and they will recover.

Share any other advice below and I’ll add the best to this list.

They advised me to open a official complaint with Trading 212 by emailing them here: Compliance@trading212.co.uk

If you are unhappy with their reply you then escalate it to the FINANCIAL OMBUDSMAN who then charges the company for processing a complaint. 

0800 0234567 Financial ombudsman

If T212 hasn’t replied within 8 weeks you can go straight to the ombudsman!

I will create a draft email in which you may copy.

Trading 212,

I wish to make a formal complaint about the services you failed to provide on a very important day for trading, thousands of customers have been affected by your lack of contingency plan as I am aware your intermediary (IB) has halted sell and buy orders. 

Under section SYSC 3.1 Systems and controls of the FCA handbook ( https://www.handbook.fca.org.uk/handbook/SYSC/3/1.html ) I believe you have terribly failed your responsibility.

Who knows if this manipulation in the stock market was conspired between yourself and other brokers but i’m sure it will soon be investigated by the proper authorities.

In the mean time honest consumers such as myself are left with our money held up in stocks that can plummet and rise by (15%+) every few minutes without a way to exit our positions. Due to the volatility you claim your intermediary was ‘looking out’ for the owners of these stocks by implementing these restrictions but I don’t believe that.

If your response is unsatisfactory I will be escalating this complaint further to the financial ombudsmen.

We'll punish our selfs watching things others would consider torture, because we think it's fun.

We'll spend most if not all of our free time drawing porn of a fictional character all to draw out a single extra upvote on Reddit.com.

Many of us have made careers out of doing just these things: eating our doritos, all day, the same doujins over and over, hundreds of times to the point where we know every tiny little bit of plot and detail such that some have attained such weeb nirvana that they can literally masturbate blindfolded.

Do these people have any idea how many barely-legal girls have been lewded, crunchyroll memberships paid?, manga covers wet in semen in climaxation? All to latter be referred to as bragging rights?

These people honestly think this is a battle they can win? They take our manga storylines? We're already making a fanfic without them. They take our artists? Weebs aren't shy about throwing their patreon money else where, or even drawing the hentai ourselves. They think calling us racist, mysoginistic, pedo apologists is going to change us? We've been called worse things by prepubescent 9 year olds with a spongebob profile picture. They picked a fight against a group that's already grown desensitized to their strategies and methods. Who enjoy the pile of useless anime trivia videos they've threatened us with. Who take it as a challenge when they tell us we no longer matter. Our obsession with proving we can after being told we can't is so deeply ingrained from years of dealing with big onii sans/onee chans and friends laughing at how pathetic we used to be that proving you people wrong has become a very real need; a honed reflex.

Weebs are sensitive, but defensive, by nature. We love a good NTR doujin. The worst thing you did in all of this was to challenge us. You're not special, you're not original, you're not the first; this is just another isekai for us.",0.094,0.83,0.076,-0.7997

4513,EOD,"Keep two things in mind:

1. GME took off the last 90 minutes of the day yesterday after being flat for a couple hours.

2. Even if GME **doesn't** take off, we are up **120%** already today, and judging from the price action today, **no shorts have covered their positions today**. Today is a HUGE win do far, even if we close at the current price.

Also, it looks like there were a few short attacks today - once in pre-market after the false news story and a couple other times throughout the morning. In all instances, the price went back almost immediately.

The short positions are in a far worse position today than they were yesterday. On top of that, for the third day in a row, **every single call option available is in the money**. After last week, we can assume people have been gobbling up new FDs every morning that the price has been below strike price. **This will create another gamma squeeze on Friday that bleeds over into Monday pre-market**. This gamma squeeze is completely independent of the short squeeze and only further worsens their position.

At this point, and especially if we close anywhere near or above $300 today: **the only way out for shorts will be to give in and force/accelerate the short squeeze with the intent to try and fully exit by EOD tomorrow**. We are so late in the week that doing so may be impossible. Even if they intentionally bought every sell order on the book, and continued to do so - there may not be enough liquid float for them to turn over all their short positions.

They are literally trapped right now, and there's almost nothing in the way of a gamma squeeze this weekend, which exacerbates the short squeeze even more. And the longer they hold out, the higher the target price will be when the short squeeze finally does happen.

1. GME took off the last 90 minutes of the day yesterday after being flat for a couple hours.

2. Even if GME **doesn't** take off, we are up **120%** already today, and judging from the price action today, **no shorts have covered their positions today**. Today is a HUGE win do far, even if we close at the current price.

Also, it looks like there were a few short attacks today - once in pre-market after the false news story and a couple other times throughout the morning. In all instances, the price went back almost immediately.

The short positions are in a far worse position today than they were yesterday. On top of that, for the third day in a row, **every single call option available is in the money**. After last week, we can assume people have been gobbling up new FDs every morning that the price has been below strike price. **This will create another gamma squeeze on Friday that bleeds over into Monday pre-market**. This gamma squeeze is completely independent of the short squeeze and only further worsens their position.

At this point, and especially if we close anywhere near or above $300 today: **the only way out for shorts will be to give in and force/accelerate the short squeeze with the intent to try and fully exit by EOD tomorrow**. We are so late in the week that doing so may be impossible. Even if they intentionally bought every sell order on the book, and continued to do so - there may not be enough liquid float for them to turn over all their short positions.

They are literally trapped right now, and there's almost nothing in the way of a gamma squeeze this weekend, which exacerbates the short squeeze even more. And the longer they hold out, the higher the target price will be when the short squeeze finally does happen.

Remember Longs. To tie up all available shares. What needs to be done is we need active orders on all owned shares. So set a sell limit order of say 1000 a share. And set the good till date good till cancel. Basically, the same system we are fighting allows shorts to borrow our shares to use against up. This is in the fine print when you sign up with your broker. How do you beat them? Put an active order on the share. As long as there is an active order on your shares then the banks cannot lend the shorts your shares to bet against you. Which in return will create a higher share price for us all. Some brokers have an auto lend option they can check off but some do not. Just to be sure put an active order on the shares. This will raise the price significantly. In return will scare the crap out of the short position forcing them to cover. And bam we win. End of story. Thank me later.

4649,GME,"After a week of holding, the prices are spiking just as they did every day before. This Friday feels like the beginning of your life. Yesterday the Melvin and CNBC offices were raided for market manipulation. Cramer left those losers and decided to like stocks.

Yesterday you convinced your mom to buy $GME too, and you're excited for her happy retirement.

You feel a little faint, and take a moment to reflect. When you close your eyes, the gates of Valhǫll reveal themselves to you. You enter. There are enormous, armor-clad women with huge breastplates emblazoned with $GME.

Standing in the back, gazing at you approvingly, are Ryan Cohen, DFV, Cramer, and Chamath. Also that weird rabbit mascot gamestop had when we were kids.

All around you is the sound of analogue Gamecube controllers, mid 2000s macho video game commercials, and wives leaving their boyfriends for their husband.

You look down and realize that you, too, are giant. At this point you realize, the floors are made of xbox 360 cases. You look up. The ceiling is PS5s -- but unlike the mortals, they aren't out of reach to you. They are yours. Your power is endless. This isn't Valhǫll -- this is Power to the Players.

You open your eyes, and your shares are suspended before you with a ""sell"" button and a value of $1694.20. Not on your phone -- on the very fabric of the universe. This is your moment. You look down and say ""No, I like the stock💎🙌"" and you ascend to godhood.

That is what we are waiting for. We are still on the mortal plane, but that will not last forever. What will last forever are our deeds, and our 💎🙌

Not financial advice, but this is spiritual advice. $GMEhalla is my religion and this is a blog post to make my friends laugh. This post is the ever-evolving book of $GMEhalla.

&#x200B;

I accept offerings to keep the church of $GMEhalla going in the form of stonks, stocks, stocks people like, tendies, stocks we like, nudes, pictures of your stock buys, and replies that include ""I appreciate that you are not giving me financial advice.""",0.033,0.857,0.11,0.983

2. Their core customer base is the WSB demographic, and floating more shares would hurt them. If GME holds out and doesn't float any more stock they will have lifetime loyalty of every single person in this sub, and that's worth more than a short term cash injection.

**They can only even borrow 75,000 more shares to short. THEY WILL HAVE TO COVER! The battle is almost won! Don't sell until at least 2/12!**

Isn't it interesting that no one on CNBC is talking about the Gamma Squeeze? I haven't heard a SINGLE mention of it. Yet... that pops off again on Friday! Numbers/Math ain’t capable of lies but PEOPLE and MEDIA certainly are. Hold your nerve!

Make sure you know the Short Squeeze hasn't even begun!

Another Gamma Squeeze still coming on **Friday**. SHORTS HAVE NOT CLOSED!

4789,IMO,"My 2 cents:

Normally, a short squeeze is dangerous because you’re riding it up (or down lmao retards) at the whims of a financial juggernaut.

This is so different. We have hundreds of thousands of small personal investors interested in holding to squeeze every drop out of some scummy billionaires.

The squeeze has not happened yet. The CNBC article today about the hedge fund “already covering” is completely false. They’re trying the same manipulation tactics they always do, but this time we won’t listen to the lies and the fear mongering. IMO, all this does is make me more confident that they are afraid of losing. Afraid of us buying and holding. Afraid of us stealing from the rich.

This is not the squeeze yet. This is just pre-cum. You can stay for the final ejaculation , or you can wipe yourself off and leave. 🧻",0.151,0.766,0.083,-0.8485

Isn't it interesting that no one on CNBC is talking about the Gamma Squeeze? I haven't heard a SINGLE mention of it. Yet... that pops off again on Friday! Numbers/Math ain’t capable of lies but PEOPLE and MEDIA certainly are. Hold your nerve!

I remember in 2008 worrying about us getting evicted because things were so bad while the fat cats were getting bailed out. And of course we all remember the stimulus money big corporations got while the middles class got fucking $1200.

Shares of both GameStop and AMC Entertainment Holdings more than doubled on Wednesday, forcing hedge funds to take heavy losses and sparking calls for scrutiny of anonymous stock market trading posts on social media.

Psaki said the U.S. stock market was not the only measure of the health of the economy, and President Joe Biden was continuing to press for approval of a $1.9 trillion economy recovery package to aid working- and middle-class families.

I know people who had less and suffered worse.

Out of school I experienced being homeless. I had to choose between food or rent. I went back to school and watched my credit drop like a rock while my landlord screamed at me and the bank tried to take my car back.
I know people who have struggled more.

$10,000 or more. Every step of my life has been more difficult because some greedy fuck decided they didn't have quite enough. I have defended the middle class and the poor and the fucked up to boomers for more than half my life.

I want these fucks to bleed. I am happy to take my small share from them but I want their wealth redistributed amongst ALL of us in recompense for their freed and disregard for the suffering and struggle of us peasants.

5001,GME,"Let's take a trip in the way back machine to 2017-2019 as hedge funds were on a campaign to short GME into a position that they would no longer be able to access capital to turn around.

Let's focus on the months that GME was at its lowest. Sub-$4 range, from it's previous levels of ~$25. Pur yourself in their shoes. You've suppressed the price by 500%. However you're now in a position that more than 100% of shares are short. You're clearly in a position that this could short squeeze into a situation of INFINITE RISK.

Do you take your profits and call it a day? No. You DOUBLE DOWN and continue shorting shares. The stock price is THREE DOLLARS. That means your MAXIMUM UPSIDE to shorting the stock further is THREE DOLLARS. Don't forget, you already made TWENTY DOLLARS PER SHARE if you leave now. But you want that last three dollars so fucking bad.

So you come up with a genius plan. Let's take on positions with INFINITE RISK in a self-created powder keg that ~~could~~ **100% certainly will** explode at the first positive catalyst. We can increase our profits from $20 to $23 if we bankrupt this company. That's 15% MAXIMUM upside at that point. All for the low risk position of **literally infinity**.

What could possibly go wrong?

You talk to your wife and you both agree: you'll submit your retirement notice right after you collect your Q1 bonus. Since it's going to be your last bonus, you agree, it better be a good one.

Your bonus structure is straightforward: the more you percentage points you beat the S&P 500 by, the bigger your bonus. You don't beat, you don't get a bonus. You blow up your portfolio, you're fired, of course.

It's Monday February 1st, and one of your flunkies asks you if you saw that $GME hit $1000 last Friday. ""$GME?"" you say, ""the nearly bankrupt video game retailer?"". They explain to you that yes, a bunch of retail investors bought the meme. It clicks: this is how you're going to secure your last sweet sweet bonus.

5141,BOOM,"Alright retards listen up.

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

It's T - 8H away from war.

Let me tell you something you ought to fuckin know.

Heard of Hernán Cortés? Let me explain.

In the year 1519, this motherfucker arrived in the New World with six hundred men and, upon arrival, made history by destroying his ships. Upon reaching New World, they encountered many hostiles that didn't want him and his men there. He was there to conquer the land.

Some of his men were unconvinced of success, and being loyal to Cuba, they tried to seize some ships to escape to there. Cortez got wind of the plot, and captured the ringleaders. He wanted to make sure that the remainder of his men were completely committed to his mission and quest for riches, so he did something that seemed completely insane to his people: **Cortez gave the order to scuttle his own ships.** 

That's right. This motherfucker ordered his own men to burn their ships. His men resisted at first, wondering how they would even get home, and his answer was:  “If we are going home, we are going home in their ships!”

That's right, we are going to swim in THEIR money.

So listen up retards. For the next few days, there is no retreat. There is no return. Going all in is the way, we ride this to the point of no fucking return and till those big boys shiver in fucking fear. It's time for the little guys to win. We 2 million fucking degenerates are going to invade these fuckers, make them drown in their own mistakes. How can they keep getting it out unscathed? I saw a comment in the thread saying ""if you're rich, it's a mistake. if you're poor, it's a crime"". How true is that..

Fear not, we will all make it out alive.

These huge funds can manipulate the market, and they just get a bailout from their billionaire friends at Citadel. Then they have the nerve to turn us into public enemy, paint all of us bad with a single brush. Fuck these guys. Next few days they will try their very best to shake us off, to instil fear. 

Fear not, let me tell you something. Financial institutions and funds have been merging into a smaller number of very large banks and funds. Almost all banks and funds are somewhat interrelated. So the financial ecology is swelling into gigantic, incestuous, bureaucratic funds --- when one fucking falls, they all fucking fall. True, we now have fewer failures, but when they occur... I shiver at the thought.

We left some good man at the top, we leave no men behind. I am not sure how long this fight will be, but we will come out alive.

I understand that shorting stocks like Melvin Capital did exposes them to infinite losses.

Hypothetically speaking, what would happen if we all set a Limit Order Sell for $69,420 a share? When Melvin gets margin called, they MUST buy the shares, right?

I haven’t slept well in days and I was finally able to doze off for more than an hour only to have a lucid dream where I’ve sold for $69,420,000 a share. I woke up next to my wife’s boyfriend, sweaty and shaking. 

Also, what’s the mechanism if Melvin can’t buy all shorted stock when the margin call finally comes? Does the issuing institution and their umbrella insurance policy take the hit?

Some one please correct me. I’m pretty sure I’m misunderstanding something and just completely wrong about the situation. But my googling hasn’t really provided an understandable answer.

I like the stock and I AIN’T SELLIN’!....but I might for $69,420,000,000 a share.

5227,DD,"So strap in fellow space men, we’re about to go where no autist has gone before.

And I do mean strap in. We may see one of the most volatile days a single stock has ever seen. Really. There’s so much going on today it’s going to be fucking *wild*.

I’m going to talk about a few things you need to be aware of. I understand you can’t read, so ask your sister & mother to read it to you. They’re the same person so shouldn’t take you long.

There WILL be stop hunts. We’ve already seen them. We saw them yesterday. A stop hunt is when the price is briefly, artificially depressed in an attempt to trigger your stop loss. A stop loss is what a coward sets. Your broker has almost certainly sold information to the MMs and hedge funds about where your stop loss is set, so they’re coming for you. They want you out of the stock and too scared to buy back in.

Ortex estimates that the short position is still roughly 120% of the float. That means more shares have been shorted than exist. This is important for two reasons. Firstly, it means the squeeze hasn’t fucking happened yet. The movements we’re seeing are largely down to investor sentiment. Second, it means that if Melvin have exited (I don’t think they have, for what it’s worth, there hasn’t been enough volume), they were only a tiny part of the overall short position. It changes fucking nothing. They are not as important as either we or they think they are or were.

CNBC reported Melvin are out. They reported that a Melvin rep told them that (I say rep, they say founder, tomato potato). If Melvin lied, it’s an SEC violation (assuming CNBC did their DD and checked who they were talking to was who they claimed to be). If CNBC lied, that may also be an SEC violation. So either Melvin are actually out, or one (or both) of CNBC and Melvin are going to get bum fucked by the SEC.

The news that Melvin are out, regardless of how true it is, will trigger actions elsewhere. You don’t want to be the last bag holder when there’s an infinite downside. So a good chance we’ll see other firms cover their shorts, pushing the price up. This is not the same as the VW situation where the float was controlled by a single entity (Porsche) who decided to release a load of liquidity in one go to stabilise the market. The float is controlled by a load of smaller players, including thousands of retail investors. It’s not going to end as abruptly. This is a slower, more satisfying fuck. Not the quickie the VW shorters got.

And remember, we’re going to see crazy volatility. Legitimately the stuff of history books. Be prepared for it. Grab your favorite ornamental gourd for comfort.

You should know though, I’m retarded and should not be listened to. I worked worked all that out by smearing my own shit on the walls.",0.11,0.833,0.057,-0.9836

*We are not taking money from innocent people*

This is not a pump and dump or a scam, we are holding because there are market makers who are trying to keep the price down with bets against Gamestop. 
They overextended these bets and if we as a community hold our stocks they need to buy it from us at a high price in the future

Scroll through this subreddit and read the GME endgame posts or other posts marked as ""DD""

I managed to find a new job with less stress but the paycut put me below the poverty line again.

  I didn't risk my daughter's college fund, but I did put the small amount I had in my personal savings into GME because it wasn't doing me much good anyways and might as well right??

2. At 4PM today the NYSE reports the 1/15 short interest in stocks.

3. That report is going to show GME was shorted to fucking epically epic proportions.

4. The shorters telling the world they are out are still in.  They are trying to drive down the price before the report comes out.

5. Before I hear ""BBBBut that report is from 1/15, it's not current"" - It doesn't fucking matter.  Here's why- the report will show short interest from 1/15.  It's simple charting and math to see how much short interest was removed from 1/15 to today.  And what that math will show is that GME is still massively shorted at a level of 2x-4x the float.

5308,DD,"So lets work through this whole Melvin is out thing. Not that it really matters given the size of the overall short position.

If they’re out and, as they said, did so before market close yesterday they must have held a far smaller position than everyone thought. The volume just wasn’t there. Either that or they’ve started to close out but haven’t been able to fully cover yet so they’ll continue to do so. Or, maybe, they’ve been slowly covering for a while and they finished doing so yesterday. So are they out? Are they not out? Did they have fewer positions than everyone thought? Who the fuck knows, they may have really fucked themselves either way.

Ultimately it doesn’t matter. There are still a fuck ton of short positions out there, so the squeeze is still on.

What about the reporting. The generic CNBC white guy in suit said he’d spoken to Melvin. If Melvin reported to him that they were out when they weren’t, this is an SEC violation. An actual one, not the fairytale ones CNBC have been accusing us of. If CNBC did their DD and established it was a Melvin rep they were talking to, then it’s more on Melvin than CNBC. Would Melvin lie to put themselves in a better position? Not out of the realms of possibilities given how large the downside is and the relatively toothless nature of the SEC when it comes to misleading the market (can anyone remember the last time they really went after anyone for doing it? Hedge funds seem to openly brag about it these days and nothing happens).

https://imgflip.com/i/4vcr4t

CNBC can still go fuck themselves for the way they’ve repeatedly tried to suppress retail investor during this whole thing though. It’s clear where their allegiances lie.

So what now? Well there are still massive short positions outstanding and the price is high. Now that one large holder is out, the others will be inclined to follow (you don’t want to be the bag holder when there’s an infinite downside). If history is to be repeated, we’re going to see massive swings in price with huge spikes. Also expect there to be a lot of stop hunting to catch new entrants in to the ticker.

The one thing I can guarantee is volatility. And this is where we thrive. I literally couldn’t care less if this goes to zero, I’m here for the ride and it’s 🌚 or sleeping under a bridge.",0.088,0.847,0.065,-0.9404

GME is in a infinite short/gamma squeeze with no way out until you get enough sellers at a certain price. It's a loop that only occurs once in a lifetime, and after this new guidelines will be written. So follow along. there is a float of 47 million shares. Cohen bought 13% and had the option of 20% which the float hasn't been adjusted. so lets say he owns 14 million shares because shares outstanding 70 million. Ok so the float is 34 million and this is the number to base everything off. The total shares short when last listed were 70 million. Then you have 2 million CALLS deep IN THE MONEY this is important. The 2 million CALLS represent 200 million shares and if the float is only 34 million then the CALL sellers are net short 166 million followed by the other 70 million shares which gets you at 236 million shares net short. So it's like a spring coil every time the stock goes up the CALL sellers need to delta hedge or buy shares to off set their CALLS, but they can't because really only 34 million available shares. So the stock goes up, CALL buyers buy even more shares, shorts cover some because price rockets. Then the price goes really high the longs decide to sell to lock in some gains causing the stock to go back down, but then when it drops the shorts start covering more causing it to go back up and the CALL Sellers are still way off on the delta hedge. This spring is in a infinite loop causing it to go higher and higher. The only way out because there is not enough shares to buy, is for the price to rise to such a level that people sell in mass. This won't stop until 3 things happen, and all three will cause the price so much higher than right now. 1st they can't short this and they need to cover in mass. 2nd they need to buy back these CALLS in mass and I mean maybe 200K total CALLS outstanding. 3rd they need to drop the short float to like 10-12 million or 30% or below. Lastly they need so many sellers and I mean like millions of people selling. The only way this stops is if everything comes to fruition, but the price is going to be SO much higher than now for these to happen. Gamestop could spit in everyone face when they walk in the door and it's won't matter because this stock is stuck in this insane loop

Melvin and Citadel have access to Robinhood information, and perhaps more on positions, limit sells and most importantly, stop losses. This is because Citadel is the broker to Robinhood. 

Why should you remove them? Because they can manipulate they market down to where the average holder has a stop loss to limit their own losses, as evidenced 10 minutes before close today (didn't work though lol) 

Please montior the stock instead. It may also be wise to remove limit sells, as they can probably use this against you too.

Melvin and Citadel have access to Robinhood information, and perhaps more on positions, limit sells and most importantly, stop losses. This is because Citadel is the broker to Robinhood. 

Why should you remove them? Because they can manipulate they market down to where the average holder has a stop loss to limit their own losses, as evidenced 10 minutes before close today (didn't work though lol) 

Please montior the stock instead. It may also be wise to remove limit sells, as they can probably use this against you too.

5658,GME,"Hedge funds are shorting GME, perceiving GME to have no or little value.

Shorting is where they borrow someone else's stock, let's say 1000 shares, they sell them all, and then sometime later they buy back the 1000 shares (which hopefully has gone down in price), with them keeping the difference while the rebought stock is given back to the original owner.

So these hedge funds borrowed millions of GME stock (shorting), sold them at sub $40 prices, expecting GME to crash to $20 and below, making them a nice profit.

So reddit autists come in and claim GME has value (it's true, people give things value), $40 was quoted. And they all joined together and now the price is $175+.

Here's the thing, those hedge funds that were originally gambling that Gamestop is going to crash need to rebuy those stocks again to give back to the original owners. It's how shorting works.

The hedge funds could have rebought the stock as soon as Gamestop hit $40. But they got cocky. They sent their spies and propaganda to the news media. This is just a fad, GME will crash, and so on.

But GME's still going up.

Here's the thing, the shorted stock has to be rebought. If they fail to do so, they face penalties, lawsuits, being barred from the markets again. 

And when they do rebuy the stock, the stock will jump in price due to the increased demand of them buying the stock. Shorting has a time limit until which they have to rebuy the stock to give back to the owner. Rumor is these hedge funds need to rebuy the stocks some time end of this week.

So WSB autists are just holding GME stock and buying on dips while they wait for the hedge funds to cave, costing the hedge funds billions.

Simple.

These guys ruined my family in 2008. My father, a brilliant brilliant architect face on his hands in tears trying but failing to stay strong for his kids. He never gave up, though he saw ruin. He is doing well-ish today. But he lost his entire retirement in 2008 and has had to use all potential retirement funds after that to keep his business alive.

At the end of the day, he'll get a deduction equal to the value of the stock when he donated it.  Let's say GME goes to $1000 and he got in at $20.

For every stock of GME he donates, he gives away $9,980 of profit and $20 of cost.  So he reduces his tax liability by the full $1,000... which basically wipes out one held share's worth of profit.

He would have to give away about half his shares to wipe out the tax liability here, and giving them away at the same time he sold the other half so that the prices were closely aligned.

Giving away 50% of your stock to avoid paying 35% in taxes doesn't make mathematical sense.

If you want to donate, donate, but it doesn't work as a way to avoid paying the taxes here, primarily because this is a short term investment(unless everyone is thinking this stock is going to continue like this for over a year).  If this were a long term capital gain, the tax rate on the $9,980 would be significantly lower so donating one share could offset a lot more than one sold share.

Ok folks, the time is upon us, market closed at $146 and by the time of writing this the prices of shares are $208 EACH!!

This is insane, but it is important to all newbies who want to make a quick buck to know why everyone is shouting ""HOLD"" and ""DIAMOND HANDS"" and ""DON'T SELL"" all the time.

The fact of the matter is this: When the short squeeze happens, the people who shorted the shares for GME will be FORCED TO BUY AT THE FIRST AVAILABLE PRICE. Once this happens, demand will increase, triggering the next wave of shorters to cover their positions and buy at THE NEXT AVAILABLE PRICE.

🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀

Now what I'm going to say next is possibly the most important part of this whole post: WE COLLECTIVELY CONTROL THE PRICES AT WHICH THE SHORT SELLERS HAVE TO BUY THEIR SHARES. That's right, if 100% of people who owned shares in GME right now were to set their limit sells to $1000, then the shorts would be forced to buy at that price to cover their positions. This is why you need to hold, the more people who sell early means the more volatile the market will be. Don't be scared if the market dips, don't be scared if the price increases to $300 and you think it'll drop.

DON'T BE SCARED!! So far we have, as individuals working together towards a common goal, fucked over at least two multi-billion dollar companies who shorted the shares to be greedy and screw over the little man. If you think we will crumble when the share price reaches a measly few hundred pounds you are dead fucking wrong. Buy shares, don't sell them, set your sell limit at $1000, we all win.

Ok folks, the time is upon us, market closed at $146 and by the time of writing this the prices of shares are $208 EACH!!

This is insane, but it is important to all newbies who want to make a quick buck to know why everyone is shouting ""HOLD"" and ""DIAMOND HANDS"" and ""DON'T SELL"" all the time.

The fact of the matter is this: When the short squeeze happens, the people who shorted the shares for GME will be FORCED TO BUY AT THE FIRST AVAILABLE PRICE. Once this happens, demand will increase, triggering the next wave of shorters to cover their positions and buy at THE NEXT AVAILABLE PRICE.

🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀

Now what I'm going to say next is possibly the most important part of this whole post: WE COLLECTIVELY CONTROL THE PRICES AT WHICH THE SHORT SELLERS HAVE TO BUY THEIR SHARES. That's right, if 100% of people who owned shares in GME right now were to set their limit sells to $1000, then the shorts would be forced to buy at that price to cover their positions. This is why you need to hold, the more people who sell early means the more volatile the market will be. Don't be scared if the market dips, don't be scared if the price increases to $300 and you think it'll drop.

DON'T BE SCARED!! So far we have, as individuals working together towards a common goal, fucked over at least two multi-billion dollar companies who shorted the shares to be greedy and screw over the little man. If you think we will crumble when the share price reaches a measly few hundred pounds you are dead fucking wrong. Buy shares, don't sell them, set your sell limit at $1000, we all win. (If you want to of course this is not financial advice ;))

To the moon my dear retards!

Gamers.

We're a group of people who will sit for hours, days, even weeks on end performing some of the hardest, most mentally demanding tasks. Over, and over, and over all for nothing more than a little digital token saying we did.

We'll punish our selfs doing things others would consider torture, because we think it's fun.

We'll spend most if not all of our free time min maxing the stats of a fictional character all to draw out a single extra point of damage per second.

Many of us have made careers out of doing just these things: slogging through the grind, all day, the same quests over and over, hundreds of times to the point where we know evety little detail such that some have attained such gamer nirvana that they can literally play these games blindfolded.

Do these people have any idea how many controllers have been smashed, systems over heated, disks and carts destroyed 8n frustration? All to latter be referred to as bragging rights?

These people honestly think this is a battle they can win? They take our media? We're already building a new one without them. They take our devs? Gamers aren't shy about throwing their money else where, or even making the games our selves.

They picked a fight against a group that's already grown desensitized to their strategies and methods. Who enjoy the battle of attrition they've threatened us with. Who take it as a challange when they tell us we no longer matter. Our obsession with proving we can after being told we can't is so deeply ingrained from years of dealing with big brothers/sisters and friends laughing at how pathetic we used to be that proving you people wrong has become a very real need; a honed reflex.

Gamers are competative, hard core, by nature. We love a challange. The worst thing you did in all of this was to challange us. You're not special, you're not original, you're not the first; this is just another boss fight.

The fact of the matter is this: When the short squeeze happens, the people who shorted the shares for GME will be FORCED TO BUY AT THE FIRST AVAILABLE PRICE. Once this happens, demand will increase, triggering the next wave of shorters to cover their positions and buy at THE NEXT AVAILABLE PRICE.

Now what I'm going to say next is possibly the most important part of this whole post: WE COLLECTIVELY CONTROL THE PRICES AT WHICH THE SHORT SELLERS HAVE TO BUY THEIR SHARES. That's right, if 100% of people who owned shares in GME right now were to set their limit sells to $1000, then the shorts would be forced to buy at that price to cover their positions. This is why you need to hold, the more people who sell early means the more volatile the market will be. Don't be scared if the market dips, don't be scared if the price increases to $300 and you think it'll drop.

DON'T BE SCARED!! So far we have, as individuals working together towards a common goal, fucked over at least two multi-billion dollar companies who shorted the shares to be greedy and screw over the little man. If you think we will crumble when the share price reaches a measly few hundred pounds you are dead fucking wrong. Buy shares, don't sell them, set your sell limit at $1000, we all win.

This is insane, but it is important to all newbies who want to make a quick buck to know why everyone is shouting ""HOLD"" and ""DIAMOND HANDS"" and ""DON'T SELL"" all the time.

The fact of the matter is this: When the short squeeze happens, the people who shorted the shares for GME will be FORCED TO BUY AT THE FIRST AVAILABLE PRICE. Once this happens, demand will increase, triggering the next wave of shorters to cover their positions and buy at THE NEXT AVAILABLE PRICE.

Now what I'm going to say next is possibly the most important part of this whole post: WE COLLECTIVELY CONTROL THE PRICES AT WHICH THE SHORT SELLERS HAVE TO BUY THEIR SHARES. That's right, if 100% of people who owned shares in GME right now were to set their limit sells to $1000, then the shorts would be forced to buy at that price to cover their positions. This is why you need to hold, the more people who sell early means the more volatile the market will be. Don't be scared if the market dips, don't be scared if the price increases to $300 and you think it'll drop.

6455,FOR,"Alright ya filthy animals. I’m here to help you figure out how to play GME tomorrow.

1.	**Shares**

Buy em, hold em, **don’t sell em**. It’s going to be a bumpy ride and most of ya rookies don’t got the testicular fortitude for seeing wild swings in your portfolio. Shares mitigate that. The next part is of the utmost importance. **YOU PUT A LIMIT ORDER IN FOR YOUR SHARES**. Why? Because unbeknownst to you, your broker will loan these for ridiculous fees of which you get nothing (as high as 84% today). Willing to bet most of you paste eaters had no idea about this. Yep, the game is rigged against you. But they can’t loan them if you’re trying to sell them. Just put whatever price in you want ($1,000 or $420.69). This is moot if you’ve been shares cash only.

2.	**Weekly calls**

Buy a call that’s 1 or 2 strikes OTM from the current stock price. Why? Because a large MM just sold you that call. Your broker sells your order flow to MM’s so they can make money. The game is rigged against you. To offset his risk the MM will then go buy an amount of shares corresponding to the option delta. 0.80 Delta = MM buys 80 shares. The closer your option is to the strike price, the more MM has to buy in the market. This is a basic understanding of the term Gamma Squeeze you just heard about yesterday.

3.	**Multi-leg approach**

>Sell a cash secured put 1-2 strikes OTM

>Use the money you got from selling the put to buy a call 1-2 OTM

Now the MM will buy shares to cover both the call and put. Double the gamma. Double the fun.

And just remember. **WE LIKE THE STOCK**. We did not short this stock. We buy this stock because we know its undervalued. We believe in using our money to power good companies in a free market economy. We did everything right in the market. They played stupid games and won stupid prizes. We go to the moon.

You autists on this sub would go balls deep and emerge bathing in gains thick enough to suffocate a man. I grew envious and FOMO ate away at me. I honestly didn’t think GME would go anywhere. I listened to people who called it overvalued. I watched as it climbed from $12 to $60 to 150. After it crashed to 75 yesterday, I took out and withdrawal and threw it into GME. Fuck it. Yolo, right? I mean, if I wanted to make some stacks, I had to embrace the brainless mindset you guys had 

Went to bed. Slept in rather late and woke up to 100% gains. After hours hit and we saw $200. It honestly feels like a dream and I don’t want it to end. It feels insanely illegal as to how ridiculously easy this was. I made more overnight than a week of work. You guys are all over the news, and now apparently daddy Elon is tweeting about us. What a day to be alive. I’m holding strong. If I’ve learned anything from watching you guys, it’s YOLO and hold with Diamond hands. I’m not selling until we see 1000 🖐💎🖐💎


Grandpa’s in tears watching me post this. His sorry ass had everything in ETF’s. What a loser. My friends asked me what my secret was. My answer?? “Stonks only go up” 🚀🚀🚀

The only regret I have is not buying more shares sooner. I’m not even sure why the hell it’s called “GameStop.” It won’t stop, can’t stop. We should rename it “GameContinue” at this point. No way this train’s slowing down anytime soon. If anything, we just filled the fuel tank to the brim. We haven’t even made it to the moon yet, but I can tell we’re on course for Jupiter.

There are currently **152,134** call contracts expiring Friday that are ITM (if we keep above $320). That is potentially **15 million shares** that need to be purchased on Friday by the banks (out of 50 million float).  If GME is still somehow trading below 1000 it will hit that an more, if it is above already the ceiling is infinite.

The people are finally taking the power back from these boomer hedge fund big money shorting douchebags - the same people who fucked everyone over in 2008 with CDOs and continue to fuck you over to this day.

We only have strength if we stay in this TOGETHER. HOLD THE LINE. THE SHORT SQUEEZE HASNT HAPPENED YET. Don’t pussy out you fucking idiots, we are going BALLS DEEP. The generation that perfected trash talk in COD lobbies takes shit from NOBODY. $10,000 IS NOT A MEME. I love you all you beautiful autistic bulls.

MAKE NO MISTAKE. GME IS THE HOLY GRAIL

The huge spike in anti-WSB, anti-GME propaganda, and bots shilling other stocks today should give you 100% confidence that this GME squeeze has not yet even begun. We HOLD for ourselves. We HOLD for our families! We HOLD for each other. HOLD THE LINE!!!!!!!

Remain calm. Don't watch the ticker or the news too much today if you can help it.

If these fuckers had covered by now, they would no longer have skin in the game and would not be putting so much time, money and energy into this anti-WSB, anti-GME propaganda. With every day they squirm more. They will realize in a couple days that there's no way out of this but to bend over and give a massive payout to the people. They REALLY want us to sell and are pulling out every dirty trick in the book to try to make that happen. Well all of them can all go fuck themselves because I'M NOT FUCKING SELLING!!!!!!!!

There is definitely a huge spike in bots and hedge fucks in the subreddit now. THEY WANT TO SCARE YOU, THEY WANT YOU TO SELL. DO NOT LET THEM SWAY YOU AWAY FROM GME. WE ARE STILL GOING TO THE MOON, DON'T GET OFF THE SHIP RETARDS.

The huge spike in anti-WSB, anti-GME propaganda, and bots shilling other stocks today should give you 100% confidence that this GME squeeze has not yet even begun. We HOLD for ourselves. We HOLD for our families! We HOLD for each other. HOLD THE LINE!!!!!!!

If these fuckers had covered by now, they would no longer have skin in the game and would not be putting so much time, money and energy into this anti-WSB, anti-GME propaganda. With every day they squirm more. They will realize in a couple days that there's no way out of this but to bend over and give a massive payout to the people. They REALLY want us to sell and are pulling out every dirty trick in the book to try to make that happen. Well all of them can all go fuck themselves because I'M NOT FUCKING SELLING!!!!!!!!

There is definitely a huge spike in bots and hedge fucks in the subreddit now. THEY WANT TO SCARE YOU, THEY WANT YOU TO SELL. DO NOT LET THEM SWAY YOU AWAY FROM GME. WE ARE STILL GOING TO THE MOON, DON'T GET OFF THE SHIP RETARDS.

GME is not a stock right now. It is a wealth transfer funnel.

Wall Street keeps dumping more and more of their wealth into this stock (in short interest, option premiums, and covered positions) because they are greedy and they think they can outlast us: to kidnap what we've rightfully stolen.

There are only three factors in how high GME can go: their greed, their coffers, and our resolve.

If they were smart, their greed would run out, and they would cover all their shorts, and the price would plateau. But they are too greedy for that. So instead they keep dumping more and more money into short interest and premiums in the hopes that their wealth can outlast our resolve. The rising stock price is because they are literally paying us right now.

If we fold, they win. If we don't fold, then eventually they go bankrupt. That is the limit.

JUST HAVE FAITH AND DONT BE SCARED OF THE LITTLE SPEED BUMPS!

MAKE NO MISTAKE. GME IS THE HOLY GRAIL

The huge spike in anti-WSB, anti-GME propaganda, and bots shilling other stocks today should give you 100% confidence that this GME squeeze has not yet even begun. We HOLD for ourselves. We HOLD for our families! We HOLD for each other. HOLD THE LINE!!!!!!!

Remain calm. Don't watch the ticker or the news too much today if you can help it.

If these fuckers had covered by now, they would no longer have skin in the game and would not be putting so much time, money and energy into this anti-WSB, anti-GME propaganda. With every day they squirm more. They will realize in a couple days that there's no way out of this but to bend over and give a massive payout to the people. They REALLY want us to sell and are pulling out every dirty trick in the book to try to make that happen. Well all of them can all go fuck themselves because I'M NOT FUCKING SELLING!!!!!!!!

There is definitely a huge spike in bots and hedge fucks in the subreddit now. THEY WANT TO SCARE YOU, THEY WANT YOU TO SELL. DO NOT LET THEM SWAY YOU AWAY FROM GME. WE ARE STILL GOING TO THE MOON, DON'T GET OFF THE SHIP RETARDS.

THE BIG SQUEEZE IS GME. ITS NOT TOO LATE TO BUY.

“20 Million shares of GME are going to be bought because of 1/29 (January 29) calls on Friday that are expiring ITM (in the money). Don’t even think about selling until then.

I looked through the options chain for GME and there are at least 200,000 options expiring on 1/29 that are easily ITM ($200 or less). All of those calls will be exercised on Friday resulting in 20,000,000 shares of the stock needing to be purchased. The stock is going to rocket higher and harder than your wife’s boyfriend when she let him do anal for the first time.”
——————
The shorts may decide to cover their positions before that happens knowing that the stock will rocket higher. That may create a perfect storm situation.

DO NOT EVEN THINK OF SELLING UNTIL FRIDAY, and even then, it’s likely the shorts will get their positions called next week based on that kind of skyrocketing activity and this will all be game over.

You feel a little faint, and take a moment to reflect. When you close your eyes, the gates of Valhǫll reveal themselves to you. You enter. There are enormous, armor-clad women with huge breastplates emblazoned with $GME.

Standing in the back, gazing at you approvingly, are Ryan Cohen, DFV, Cramer, Elizabeth Warren, and Chamath. Also that weird rabbit mascot gamestop had when we were kids.

All around you is the sound of analogue Gamecube controllers, mid 2000s macho video game commercials, and wives leaving their boyfriends for their husband.

You look down and realize that you, too, are giant. At this point you realize, the floors are made of xbox 360 cases. You look up. The ceiling is PS5s -- but unlike the mortals, they aren't out of reach to you. They are yours. Your power is endless. This isn't Valhǫll -- this is Power to the Players.

You open your eyes, and your shares are suspended before you with a ""sell"" button and a value of $6904.20. Not on your phone -- on the very fabric of the universe. This is your moment. You look down and say ""No, I like the stock💎🙌"" and you ascend to godhood. Now your wife has to rub your girlfriend's feet.

That is what we are waiting for. We are still on the mortal plane, but that will not last forever. What will last forever are our deeds, and our 💎🙌

Not financial advice, but this is spiritual advice. $GMEhalla is my religion and this is a blog post to make my friends laugh. This post is the ever-evolving book of $GMEhalla.

I accept offerings to keep the church of $GMEhalla going in the form of stonks, stocks, stocks people like, tendies, stocks we like, nudes, and replies that include ""I appreciate that you are not giving me financial advice.""",0.033,0.859,0.108,0.983

The huge spike in anti-WSB, anti-GME propaganda, and bots shilling other stocks today should give you 100% confidence that this GME squeeze has not yet even begun. We HOLD for ourselves. We HOLD for our families! We HOLD for each other. HOLD THE LINE!!!!!!!

Remain calm. Don't watch the ticker or the news too much today if you can help it.

If these fuckers had covered by now, they would no longer have skin in the game and would not be putting so much time, money and energy into this anti-WSB, anti-GME propaganda. With every day they squirm more. They will realize in a couple days that there's no way out of this but to bend over and give a massive payout to the people. They REALLY want us to sell and are pulling out every dirty trick in the book to try to make that happen. Well all of them can all go fuck themselves because I'M NOT FUCKING SELLING!!!!!!!!

There is definitely a huge spike in bots and hedge fucks in the subreddit now. THEY WANT TO SCARE YOU, THEY WANT YOU TO SELL. DO NOT LET THEM SWAY YOU AWAY FROM GME. WE ARE STILL GOING TO THE MOON, DON'T GET OFF THE SHIP RETARDS.

THE BIG SQUEEZE IS GME. ITS NOT TOO LATE TO BUY.

tl;dr: we have always been retarded but this is the least retarded we have EVER BEEN

No fucking crayons in this post. Let's look at this from a historical angle. I have been lurking since literally 2014, when this sub was filled with people posting loss porn and when people still thought the f bomb was funny and when threads weren't constant bickering between bull and bear shills

The most iconic WSB moments have also been some of the biggest collective GUHs that we have experienced as a sub. I was here when everyone was on the RAD WBA merger bullshit, when we literally thought that piece of shit RAD stock was going to MOOON to $5 per share. I lost $10K on that trade myself. I have been here for ir0nyman, and I've seen TWO separate instances of MSFT $200 tanking the entire stock market.

We are retards, easily excitable ones at that. In the past, we've gotten hyped about things that have been fully outside of the control of any retail trader. It's like, fucking free will. No matter how much we wanted those $200 4/19 puts to pan out (oh how convenient, money printer go BRRRRR), or how certain we were about quad witching (what a lame friday), the MMs and institutions ALWAYS WON.

No fucking crayons in this post. Let's look at this from a historical angle. I have been lurking since literally 2014, when this sub was filled with people posting loss porn and when people still thought the f bomb was funny and when threads weren't constant bickering between bull and bear shills

The most iconic WSB moments have also been some of the biggest collective GUHs that we have experienced as a sub. I was here when everyone was on the RAD WBA merger bullshit, when we literally thought that piece of shit RAD stock was going to MOOON to $5 per share. I lost $10K on that trade myself. I have been here for ir0nyman, and I've seen TWO separate instances of MSFT $200 tanking the entire stock market.

We are retards, easily excitable ones at that. In the past, we've gotten hyped about things that have been fully outside of the control of any retail trader. It's like, fucking free will. No matter how much we wanted those $200 4/19 puts to pan out (oh how convenient, money printer go BRRRRR), or how certain we were about quad witching (what a lame friday), the MMs and institutions ALWAYS WON.

6947,GME,"After a week of holding, the prices are spiking just as they did every day before. This Friday feels like the beginning of your life. Yesterday the Melvin and CNBC offices were raided for market manipulation. Cramer left those losers and decided to like stocks.

Yesterday you convinced your mom to buy $GME too, and you're excited for her happy retirement.

You feel a little faint, and take a moment to reflect. When you close your eyes, the gates of Valhǫll reveal themselves to you. You enter. There are enormous, armor-clad women with huge breastplates emblazoned with $GME.

Standing in the back, gazing at you approvingly, are Ryan Cohen, DFV, Cramer, Elizabeth Warren, and Chamath. Also that weird rabbit mascot gamestop had when we were kids.

All around you is the sound of analogue Gamecube controllers, mid 2000s macho video game commercials, and wives leaving their boyfriends for their husband.

You look down and realize that you, too, are giant. At this point you realize, the floors are made of xbox 360 cases. You look up. The ceiling is PS5s -- but unlike the mortals, they aren't out of reach to you. They are yours. Your power is endless. This isn't Valhǫll -- this is Power to the Players.

You open your eyes, and your shares are suspended before you with a ""sell"" button and a value of $6904.20. Not on your phone -- on the very fabric of the universe. This is your moment. You look down and say ""No, I like the stock💎🙌"" and you ascend to godhood. Now your wife has to rub your girlfriend's feet.

That is what we are waiting for. We are still on the mortal plane, but that will not last forever. What will last forever are our deeds, and our 💎🙌

Not financial advice, but this is spiritual advice. $GMEhalla is my religion and this is a blog post to make my friends laugh. This post is the ever-evolving book of $GMEhalla.

I accept offerings to keep the church of $GMEhalla going in the form of stonks, stocks, stocks people like, tendies, stocks we like, nudes, and replies that include ""I appreciate that you are not giving me financial advice.""",0.033,0.859,0.108,0.983

REMEMBER: Once you buy shares, you can hold them forever, for free. Shorts have to continuously pay lots of interest to keep their shares short sold.🍋🍋🍋🍋🍋🍋

There is literally no way for shorts to exit their costly positions without paying us, as long as we HOLD.💎💎💎💎💎💎🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼

7135,DD,"""The marketplace should be a place where risk is taken, but not reckless risk and not a situation that undermines the system and that’s what we’re looking at here,” Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth William Galvin said on “The Exchange.”

Galvin, who has served in his role for more than two decades, pointed to the fact that more than 100% of GameStop shares had been shorted prior to the epic short squeeze driven largely by retail investors who hyped the stock in online forums such as Reddit. He said the size of short position creates structural risk and “has to be addressed immediately.”

150% shorting is reckless. How many American companies have been brought to their knees with short sells? How many Americans jobs lost over the years? What if the public liked those companies and believed in them? 

Seriously this is unbelievable. I took a bigger risk taking out student loans at 7% than I did buying GME. There was excellent DD, sorry we have google? Some truly special retards even lost money on GME...somehow.

7244,AMC,"I have 4,500 shares of AMC. I'm also a really smart dumb person and sold 20 covered calls yesterday for Friday for a $7 strike price.

That $540 I got in premium is now worth like $20,000 so I'm trying to sell NEXT week's $15 strike price calls for $20,000 and then buy back/close my sold calls for this week so that I can sell my 2000 shares at $15 instead of $7.

When I tried to do this on Think or Swim they said they are not doing any new opening positions.

So I pulled out my inner Karen and called support like a real Gordon Gecko to make my order over the phone.

When I talked to support he said that even though I have 2500 extra shares of AMC IN MY ACCOUNT that I cannot sell a covered call for next week.

Why I asked why he said that they don't think they have enough shares to cover all the options that are out there and they have to protect the ""exchange"". They are doing the same with GME stocks right now.

TLDR: There aren't enough AMC or GME stocks in the wild and exchanges are caught with their pants down writing way too many options versus volume. This is significant. I think. But then again I'm a smart dumb person.

Under section SYSC 3.1 Systems and controls of the FCA handbook ( https://www.handbook.fca.org.uk/handbook/SYSC/3/1.html ) I believe you have terribly failed your responsibility.

Who knows if this manipulation in the stock market was conspired between yourself and other brokers but i’m sure it will soon be investigated by the proper authorities.

In the mean time honest consumers such as myself are left with our money held up in stocks that can plummet and rise by (15%+) every few minutes without a way to exit our positions. Due to the volatility you claim your intermediary was ‘looking out’ for the owners of these stocks by implementing these restrictions but I don’t believe that.

If your response is unsatisfactory I will be escalating this complaint further to the financial ombudsmen.

Regards,",0.087,0.86,0.053,-0.5921

gamestop isnt undervalued based on market potential and not even wsb autists are retarded enough to believe that.

the reason gamestop is going to the moon is solely due to the shortpositions. after those are covered itll easily drop down to like $40 or something. if it werent for the hyper-retards at melvin GME would be extremely overvalued atm.

its not a company that should trade for anything over $40 under normal circumstances, its the fact that melvin is trying to redistribute wealth that makes the stock worth holding, they're bringing it to the moon to give away their billions to us.

7657,IRS,"No worries, gotta start somewhere. The amount of income/profit you bring in between Jan 01 and Dec 31 will be taxable. So that includes any jobs + investments. We’ll refer to this amount as your “annual income.” The federal government taxes income brackets differently, so just Google “federal tax brackets” and find the % tax rate you expect to pay based on your projected annual income. So the amount you’re taxed (including your hypothetical  $1,000 in stock) will depend on your overall annual income and the tax bracket that applies to you. So you should take your best guess at which bracket you’ll be in, and start setting that percentage aside after recouping profit from each trade. As you get more sophisticated, you’ll learn that you can deduct losses (if/when they happen) from your profit — and if you use a tax program like TurboTax (for example) they will often be able to do this for you automatically. But if you’re just starting out I would recommend keeping it simple and setting aside a specific % of profit after each trade. That way, you won’t get caught without tax money at the end of the year and you’ll avoid problems with the IRS. Even if you save more than you need, then who cares, just reinvest it or spend it or do whatever you want with it after taxes are paid. Good luck!

P.S. - don’t forget state AND local taxes in addition to your federal tax rate. You can Google those numbers pretty easily.

P.P.S. - Also, if you choose to hold a stock for 1-year or longer, you’ll qualify for a lower tax rate on the eventual profit of your stock. That’s called the long term capital gains tax rate. You can Google that as well. But if you’re actively trading and not holding for a year, you’ll be taxed at your normal income tax rate.",0.052,0.803,0.146,0.9857

If so, then they basically MUST buy 10 potatoes somehow, and in this example, they'll buy the 10 cheapest potatoes, which will already be priced way above 5 dollars",0.007,0.958,0.035,0.7334
7664,GME,"Yes you get short and a synthetic long and what happened on GME is those synthetic longs got resold as shorts causing ""naked shorts"". There is a bit more to that but it's the basic explanation.

7677,GME,"Get rid of your 420.69 stop order. GME is chilling at over $300 pre-market this morning. Shorts haven’t even covered yet. Melvin Capitol is expected to start filing for bankruptcy as “early as next week,” according to some sources. Friday isn’t even here yet and we’ve managed to drive up the price 760% in the past week alone.

We even have Daddy Elon on our side now, and if you autists have learned anything, it’s that you don’t bet against Elon and walk away without consequences. I won’t be surprised if a selloff happens soon, as shortsellers (for whatever reason) might still be trying to trigger a massive selloff. They know they’re knee-deep in shit swamp with no way out except to liquidate their positions and ironically buy GME shares themselves, which will drive price even further up. If we stay strong, GME can easily surpass 1000. I’m betting we hit double at MINIMUM. 

All this being said, some of you will be wishing that you bought now and FOMO will eat away at you as we see this head to fucking Jupiter. If you want a funny number as a reasonable SellPoint, try 69,420. See you guys in the next galaxy soon 🚀🚀🚀",0.052,0.868,0.08,0.6249

1. ⁠Melvin Capital never discloses their positions unless they have an FCC filing
2. ⁠They didn't mention ALL positions. Could as well may have sold their puts but are still short

The short interest is still above 130% as per Zerohedge. Hold, this is them desperately trying to get the price down so that they can cover.

This is insane, but it is important to all newbies who want to make a quick buck to know why everyone is shouting ""HOLD"" and ""DIAMOND HANDS"" and ""DON'T SELL"" all the time.

The fact of the matter is this: When the short squeeze happens, the people who shorted the shares for GME will be FORCED TO BUY AT THE FIRST AVAILABLE PRICE. Once this happens, demand will increase, triggering the next wave of shorters to cover their positions and buy at THE NEXT AVAILABLE PRICE.

🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀

Now what I'm going to say next is possibly the most important part of this whole post: WE COLLECTIVELY CONTROL THE PRICES AT WHICH THE SHORT SELLERS HAVE TO BUY THEIR SHARES. That's right, if 100% of people who owned shares in GME right now were to set their limit sells to $1000, then the shorts would be forced to buy at that price to cover their positions. This is why you need to hold, the more people who sell early means the more volatile the market will be. Don't be scared if the market dips, don't be scared if the price increases to $300 and you think it'll drop.

DON'T BE SCARED!! So far we have, as individuals working together towards a common goal, fucked over at least two multi-billion dollar companies who shorted the shares to be greedy and screw over the little man. If you think we will crumble when the share price reaches a measly few hundred pounds you are dead fucking wrong. Buy shares, don't sell them, set your sell limit at $1000, we all win.

🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀

Now what I'm going to say next is possibly the most important part of this whole post: WE COLLECTIVELY CONTROL THE PRICES AT WHICH THE SHORT SELLERS HAVE TO BUY THEIR SHARES. That's right, if 100% of people who owned shares in GME right now were to set their limit sells to $1000, then the shorts would be forced to buy at that price to cover their positions. This is why you need to hold, the more people who sell early means the more volatile the market will be. Don't be scared if the market dips, don't be scared if the price increases to $300 and you think it'll drop.

DON'T BE SCARED!! So far we have, as individuals working together towards a common goal, fucked over at least two multi-billion dollar companies who shorted the shares to be greedy and screw over the little man. If you think we will crumble when the share price reaches a measly few hundred pounds you are dead fucking wrong. Buy shares, don't sell them, set your sell limit at $1000, we all win. (If you want to of course this is not financial advice ;))

To the moon my dear retards!

If anyone reading this is thinking about selling tomorrow, just know that this is not the top of the squeeze. We will know when the squeeze starts to get near the top when it gets halted over and over again, way more than the first time we hit 150. Who knows what we will open at tomorrow after seeing what happening in AH but if we see it at around 200ish expect some volatility.

If it opens at 200ish there is a decent chance that another Gamma Squeeze happen. A lot of people are saying we need GME to stay above 115 on Friday ,but the shorts would most likely want to cover now at 200 or so, rather than wait until Friday when GME can be at 300 instead.

Also I know some of you are going to try and be smart and sell GME at 200 or whatever hoping to get back in when it drops. Well a few people tried doing that today when GME hit 150 but missed their re entry point when GME immediately bounced back up.

If you sell, you're pretty much just giving yourself blue balls for when we pass 1000.

* Sell when the news that Melvin is covering comes out (active investing)
* Sell when DFV sells (disciple mode)
* Sell in 10-20% at a time every day once the stock hits a price you're happy with (safe)
* Hold it to the fucking Kuiper Belt ($2000+) and risk missing the squeeze (Diamond hands)

Trading 212,

I wish to make a formal complaint about the services you failed to provide on a very important day for trading, thousands of customers have been affected by your lack of contingency plan as I am aware your intermediary (IB) has halted sell and buy orders. 

Under section SYSC 3.1 Systems and controls of the FCA handbook ( https://www.handbook.fca.org.uk/handbook/SYSC/3/1.html ) I believe you have terribly failed your responsibility.

Who knows if this manipulation in the stock market was conspired between yourself and other brokers but i’m sure it will soon be investigated by the proper authorities.

In the mean time honest consumers such as myself are left with our money held up in stocks that can plummet and rise by (15%+) every few minutes without a way to exit our positions. Due to the volatility you claim your intermediary was ‘looking out’ for the owners of these stocks by implementing these restrictions but I don’t believe that.

If your response is unsatisfactory I will be escalating this complaint further to the financial ombudsmen.

Melvin and Citadel have access to Robinhood information, and perhaps more on positions, limit sells and most importantly, stop losses. This is because Citadel is the broker to Robinhood.

Why should you remove them? Because they can manipulate they market down to where the average holder has a stop loss to limit their own losses, as evidenced 10 minutes before close today (didn't work though lol)

Please montior the stock instead. It may also be wise to remove limit sells, as they can probably use this against you too.

Before everyone downvotes me to death. I'm not saying share dilution doesn't matter. Obviously it does. GME needs to wait for as long as possible to issue that $100m capital raise. In fact much like the VW squeeze, this probably ends with a secondary offering (of substantially more than $100m) that clears all of GME's debt. Which is bullish.

GME corporate absolutely should should do a secondary offering once the breakout happens to cover costs while minimising dilution. It's not for the best for stock holders but is for the best for the company long term.  They just need to wait as long as possible to minimize dilution.

Ok folks, the time is upon us, market closed at $146 and by the time of writing this the prices of shares are $333 EACH!!

This is insane, but it is important to all newbies who want to make a quick buck to know why everyone is shouting ""HOLD"" and ""DIAMOND HANDS"" and ""DON'T SELL"" all the time.

The fact of the matter is this: When the short squeeze happens, the people who shorted the shares for GME will be FORCED TO BUY AT THE FIRST AVAILABLE PRICE. Once this happens, demand will increase, triggering the next wave of shorters to cover their positions and buy at THE NEXT AVAILABLE PRICE.

🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀

Now what I'm going to say next is possibly the most important part of this whole post: WE COLLECTIVELY CONTROL THE PRICES AT WHICH THE SHORT SELLERS HAVE TO BUY THEIR SHARES. That's right, if 100% of people who owned shares in GME right now were to set their limit sells to $1000, then the shorts would be forced to buy at that price to cover their positions. This is why you need to hold, the more people who sell early means the more volatile the market will be. Don't be scared if the market dips, don't be scared if the price increases to $300 and you think it'll drop.

DON'T BE SCARED!! So far we have, as individuals working together towards a common goal, fucked over at least two multi-billion dollar companies who shorted the shares to be greedy and screw over the little man. If you think we will crumble when the share price reaches a measly few hundred pounds you are dead fucking wrong. Buy shares, don't sell them, set your sell limit at $1000, we all win. (If you want to of course this is not financial advice ;))

10371,DD,"TBF this is not a pump and AMC will not be. If WSB does not look at AMC it still recovers. The analyst and the data showed they were filing for BK and shorting was proper. It spiking allowed them to raise 900m and now they are not going BK. So the shorts will get squeezed and that is just the way it works.

This group has not found some unknown honey hole. Shorts are and have been a big part of the market and how funds control the market (manipulate it) there is no factoring in the response from message boards or any momo. you never know. This board is just less used for manipulation, people disclose positions and 100% you are more likely to be exposed as a pump and dumper here than any other group. 

I have told CEO's that they could come here and chat. They just do not understand it and it is easier to call it what they understand, a message board that us pumping and dumping. Raging Bull, Yahoo Message Boards to IHub there are scammers and people trying to do DD and it is not easy to navigate either. I own a stock where the CEO argues more with the shorts than he does updating the longs. Yes, I understand why he is mad and they are putting false pressure on data that no one knows until the FDA releases it. So the CEO is hamstrung into a position that he is unable to say much because he does not know. He can't update the base because they know what he knows. He is stuck trying to fight off a short position that uses mass media to spread the negativity.

In a vacuum, one or two funds getting fucked isn't going to matter to them, but if they start to worry that the GME squeeze is going to have cascading effects that might affect the broader market, expect them to start pulling out all the stops.

THEN  because it apparent that hedge funds have ILLEGALLY shorted ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY PERCENT of normally available shares. So the public buys up a bunch of shares because they fucked themselves and we are looking for a nice quick payday. The DOUBLE FUCKING DOWN and the rocket starts  to take on fuel and January comes around and the Autists start to load up on more stock because the dumbfucks are still shorting the position as the stock rises.

THEN they start to get railed by the markets NORMAL progress from a bunch of idiots putting faith in a new CEO for a nostalgia company and they ignite the boosters and KEEP DOUBLING DOWN. Turns out their market manipulation fails and the stock starts rise to what might actually be a fair UNMANIPULATED VALUE, they start to shit their pants and borrow THREE POINT FIVE BILLION! THEN they DOUBLE FUCKING DOWN AND BUY MORE SHORT POSITIONS. So a bunch of people have been buying knowing they will pay through the nose, and then they buy more because there are literally not enough shares to cover their positions meaning the price will HAVE TO spike. 

Now they are caught on the rocket theyt fucking fueled up and are screaching about the people that bought a ticket to ride their rocket as being responsible and manipulating the market?

 (UK FINANCIAL AUTHORITY)

They advised me to open a official complaint with Trading 212 by emailing them here: Compliance@trading212.co.uk

If you are unhappy with their reply you then escalate it to the FINANCIAL OMBUDSMAN who then charges the company for processing a complaint. 

0800 0234567 Financial ombudsman

If T212 hasn’t replied within 8 weeks you can go straight to the ombudsman!

I will create a draft email in which you may copy.

Trading 212,

I wish to make a formal complaint about the services you failed to provide on a very important day for trading, thousands of customers have been affected by your lack of contingency plan as I am aware your intermediary (IB) has halted sell and buy orders. 

Under section SYSC 3.1 Systems and controls of the FCA handbook ( https://www.handbook.fca.org.uk/handbook/SYSC/3/1.html ) I believe you have terribly failed your responsibility.

Who knows if this manipulation in the stock market was conspired between yourself and other brokers but i’m sure it will soon be investigated by the proper authorities.

In the mean time honest consumers such as myself are left with our money held up in stocks that can plummet and rise by (15%+) every few minutes without a way to exit our positions. Due to the volatility you claim your intermediary was ‘looking out’ for the owners of these stocks by implementing these restrictions but I don’t believe that.

If your response is unsatisfactory I will be escalating this complaint further to the financial ombudsmen.

11192,GME,"Yeah, SEC action against this trade would pretty much be proof of systemic oppression of working class people (which I believe anyway, any simple 30-year income inequality trend chart will show that).

You could make a really strong argument that the hedge funds caused the instability by massively overshorting GME, and retailers are now doing the free market a service by correcting the dislocation, and warning future hedge funds against causing a similar dislocation. I actually believe that..and I’m not even long GME. This would hold up if SEC ever checked my transaction history (but I’d fight it legally on principle). Experiencing massive FOMO here, but objectively, to crush retail investors like that is suppression of economic mobility. 

I’m not calling for insurrection, but come on-if they’re going to stop people from making money in the exact same way that institutional investors do it, the protests should be bigger than BLM’s. Because it’s oppression of 80%+ of America, easily. By the 1%.",0.072,0.837,0.091,0.5036

let's say DFV had decided that shorting the fuck out of GME was the play before hedge funds did, and shared that DD with us. so, imagine if it was all of us holding the shorts.

if hedge funds noticed the short, came in, and bought out crazy amounts of GME stock purely to fuck us over and take all of our money in the process, do you think we would've been any more than a one-time three minute segment on CNBC?

they would've laughed at us, reiterated that we're dumb money, and that we shouldn't be playing with the big boys. they would've mocked our hubris for thinking we could make money without their help. the thought of regulating shorts or getting the SEC involved wouldn't even cross their fucking minds.
