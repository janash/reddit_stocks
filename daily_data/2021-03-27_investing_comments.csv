Yeah. Forging numbers is scary stuff.

I just hope Nikola won't cheat the public with gravity driven truck, underwire-powered electric vehicle and CEO quitting the company, while completely duped the general public by making a deal with GE, a complicit in this fiasco.

Another thing, Wirecard, scary stuff, forging numbers.

GME, big institutes, Citadel, RH, hedge funds, colluding each other. 

I understand the concern on investment in Chinese companies. But where in the world there's an official audit on American companies? They do report quarterly earnings, but was there any official audit? 

I'll give you one example. Wirecard was audited by EY which is a legitimate and reliable auditors in the US. IF that's the case, wirecard should be caught within a few years. But they weren't caught. Why was the case? But they went under radar because it's Germany company and investors are happy to pay for it? 

I'm all for regulations at all level. But there are many crooks and cheats at big institutes here in the States. Cramer, as a hedge funds manager, openly said to create a scare, they rings a few calls to publishers after they short the companies, beat down some retailers because their quarterly earnings is coming and they need to cash in from short positions. Then they create a bull post on why stocks are discounted with higher price target. A cycle continues. The video was linked by a guy in wsb and now the video was taken down in youtube for concerns. It's simple. Cramer is afraid of digging up his old dirty tricks by recent GME disaster. 

But after all of this, we're seeing China opening up, their work schedule returns to normal while the west was still struggling with pockets of lockdowns after one year. Where in the world WFH affects the most? Clothing industry and yet we're seeing the GAP went ATH. It's because WFH workers keep buying up clothes to wear at home?

31,SE," It's likely that some kind of increased scrutiny of Chinese companies will be introduced all over the Western world during the next few years given their aggressive acquisitions, concerns about security of data, competition over standards, fears of economic espionage and pressures related to geopolitical and military alignments.

There is a high probability that world trade and investment will become more segmented as a result, with the creation of a China-led sphere and of a US-led sphere. Candidates for the China sphere are Russia, some Central Asian countries, Iran and some parts of Africa and SE Asia (such as Cambodia), where we can expect a tug of war between the two influences as the new alignments take shape.

China is extraordinarily ambitious in catching up to the West in high tech and biotech, so we will likely see heightened competition in all high value added sectors. The Chinese proposition is attractive to poorer countries due to lower costs and because Chinese companies are free to invest in and deal with countries where Western companies face various ethically-motivated constraints.",Ahrideva,5,/r/investing/comments/me7ymc/ending_china_stimulus_sec_law_enacted_provide/gsg7yi7/,0.079,0.828,0.093,0.4033

33,AI," Nobody is saying that China is dumb. Indeed they have been expanding aggressively in search of resources and markets, in particular in Central Asia, Africa and Indochina (and more recently in certain countries in Latin America such as Venezuela etc). They also did a fantastic job of cornering the production and supply chain of rare earth elements while the West was sleeping -- elements which are crucial for the green energy transition. Moreover China managed to get a head start in 5G hardware etc. and it invests aggressively in green energy technologies, robotics, AI, nanotech etc. with massive government support.

This isn't merely about identity politics or run of the mill nationalism but about geostrategic competition through economic means.  The worst risk that the world runs in this regard is the potential for a Thucydides trap, which could lead to hot conflicts in certain regions:

But he is right. If you are to take your own advice then you need to consider what he said instead of dismissing it as bias. I mean, having a few friends in China is not exactly ""reliable statistics."" There are still scattered lock downs in China. Few are reported because a) the CCP controls ALL domestic media and b) [has been busy kicking out most international media.](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-05-09/china-kicks-out-foreign-journalists-during-coronavirus-crisis/12227782) A whole city could be on lockdown the rest of the country might not know. So its not like verification is easy.  There were lockdowns in Hebei just last week in fact. Borders are still locked down. You need virus tests to be able to cross between some provinces. And any successes they had are mainly due to the direct result of having total control (surprise - China is a totalitarian state after all). China's been touting it's success that it has come out of the pandemic for ages now because that's what communists states do. The truth however is a *lot* less clear.

50,NIO," Yep. This. As a foreign investor, Chinese law restricts you from outright owning a share or stake in a Chinese company (many of which are state-owned). Enter the VIE structure: a Chinese company establishes a wholly-owned subsidiary (often in the Cayman Islands), which then is the company that is listed on a foreign exchange, allowing foreigners to invest. Foreign investors are not buying a stake in the Chinese company; instead, they are buying a contractual promise that the Chinese company will share its earnings and profits with the Cayman subsidiary, which then will be passed on to the investor.

Now let’s say NIO gets pumped; a lot of foreign money flows into it. The CCP then turns around and says, “Great, NIO has a lot of foreign money, pull the plug on the VIE and nullify the contracts.” Now the Chinese company has all your money, and you likely have no judicial recourse or remedy like you’d have here with a pump-and-dump in the States.

And if you don’t think the CCP would do such a thing, remember, in 1997, they signed a treaty to honor the Hong Kong system until the 2047. They went into Hong Kong via the National Security Law anyway, in breach of the treaty.

Cause you just linked an article without even a quote. So I went to read this article from this day trading site I don't know, with no individual author name attached to it, with a link to a WSJ article that's behind a paywall, research the topic that the WSJ article was talking about only to find [this](https://np.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/cl687n/chinese_auditors_are_on_the_hook_after_clients/) and reading that, and then back tracking through all 3 to not find anything substantive about either BABA or TCTZF other than this unnamed author(s) woes that it's hard to look into BABA's accounting due to the complex business structure, multiple businesses, and different overseas accounting rules/standards.

>Alibaba has a complex web of hundreds of subsidiaries, variable interest entities (VIEs), and separate operating entities

>So much of what goes on at Alibaba isn’t on the balance sheet with these “VIE enhancement” structures.

>I also believe they’re inflating their numbers with all their incestuous relationships between subsidiaries, VIEs, and separate entities, which means the premium is even larger.

That's the daytrading.com unnamed writer's opinion on BABA. The article wasn't even about BABA so much as it was used as an example (gotta get them clicks). It's not proof that BABA is inflating numbers.

I'm actually not looking to add China right now. I'm good on growth/tech in my portfolio since I bought a ton of that last year. Currently diversifying from tech/growth into dividend growth + value while shorting cash. I'm still holding BABA/LKNCY. 

In general, I'd say look at the biggest Chinese names and avoid smaller ones since it's usually the ones I get killed on both stateside, overseas, or in China. Buy and hold for the long term. I bought BABA at ipo around 80-90. I bought more later in the 60-80. Problem with just throwing out a name is that investing is more than just buying and holding. It's more buying and doing homework periodically. Having a few names you believe in a know well.

If I had to make a move right now then I'd probably go for one of the big Chinese tech giants, one of the already banned Chinese telecoms (you'll need to buy the HK listing), or something like KWEB if you're not familiar with China.

98,ICE," >Are they overvalued by P/E standards? Yes they are, but they have a lot of potential.

Well okay, this is my point of view which is a value investing point of view. I am a value investor and even with very extremely optimistic projections about Tesla's revenue growth and net income margin growth from selling EV's, I find that Tesla is still trading at a significant premium over what I believe to be Tesla's fair value.

This obviously doesn't mean that Tesla isn't a good company. It doesn't mean that Tesla  as a company won't grow tremendously within the next 5 years. It simply means that for me personally I'm not comfortable with paying a big premium on their stock price. I believe the market has set enormous expectations for Tesla for the coming years and I believe that even if Tesla grows a lot, it may still come under the sky-high expectations that the market have set for them. Very high expectations in general are hard to meet. For me it is not a matter whether EV's will replace ICE vehicles (I think that's pretty much set in stone already), it is not a matter whether Tesla will be able to grow their sales. The question is not IF, the question is HOW MUCH will Tesla be able to grow. Will they be able to meet the very high growth expectations that I believe the market has set up for them?

It's possible that Tesla will find other revenue streams, but personally I find it very hard to project for these and I consider significant additional revenue streams to be more speculative. (and if you look at SolarCity, honestly that subsidiary isn't promising at all, they've seen their sales and market share decrease over the past few years)

In fact I believe that Tesla is a great company and they clearly have enormous brand power, much more so than any other car company. From my anecdotal observations it seems that people are buying Tesla cars specifically because they want a Tesla and not just any other EV. Kind of like Apple in a way. Despite the competiton that is ramping up in the EV market, I think Tesla is still in a position where it can be one of the leading players.

That said the competition is definitely kicking up some gears, so that is obviously something I consider. Something to consider as well is that revenue from CO2 emission credits will decrease.

But this is why I say that good stock =/= good company. I prefer buying stock of a decent company for an amazing price rather than a stock of a great company for an exorbitant price (like TSLA stock).

I know people are going to say ""lol! value investor!! value is dead"". You may say that value doesn't matter, but on the long run I believe it does. If value wouldn't matter then how do we even begin to ascribe stock prices? Why is Tesla stock not $1000 or $5000 right now? Value doesn't matter anyway!

I think the stock market is just very inefficient at ascribing value to companies (stock prices) (which is a good thing for the value investor).

104,AMD," >Going all in on growth is risky, but you get a big pay off if you get it right. Value you won’t make much, but you’ll be in the game for the long haul. That’s why I do both!

To be honest, this seems to be a misconception.

Value investing doesn't sit on the opposite end of growth investing. Value investing is trying to pay a good price for stocks taking growth (if it's there) into account.

To be honest, this seems to be a misconception.

Value investing doesn't sit on the opposite end of growth investing. Value investing is trying to pay a good price for stocks taking growth (if it's there) into account.

114,IMO," I like where you’re going with this portfolio. Diversification is your friend, and those who say otherwise have no idea what they’re talking about. The investing holy grail is finding uncorrelated assets with positive expected return to include in your portfolio.

In terms of what you’ve built, I agree with others that the gold allocation is higher than most would recommend. Gold has a role in a portfolio, but it doesn’t produce cash flows and comes with storage costs. I would personally beef up the allocation to international equities. Silver/Gold/Bitcoin are all fine in small quantities IMO. In terms of stocks vs. long-term bonds, that depends a lot on your risk tolerance. Don’t let people shame you out of holding bonds if it makes sense for you in terms of building a portfolio with the risk characteristics that you want.

When it comes to adding things, I’d say to go for it on the international bonds. Find something that has a positive expected real return (i.e. not too heavily allocated to European sovereigns, with their negative real rates). I’d stay away from commodities, but would consider commodity related equities or real estate. Commodities themselves are more of a trade than an investment, as the non-metals have no reason to have positive real return over time.

117,TSM," I like the golden butterfly but I changed the things I changed because:

* Small-cap value performed really well post 2000 tech bubble, and for that they get more attention than they're really worth. Over the very long-term, SCV performs not that much different than Total Stock Market, so I view SCV as an unnecessary complication. I am not losing anything substantial by not investing in SCV when I have TSM.
* 20% gold vs 15% gold isn't much of a difference, but adding silver and BTC gives my portfolio a substantial amount of potential for volatility that is uncorrelated with gold. Gold and BTC have not been that correlated, and my main goal is to lower overall volatility via uncorrelated asset. BTC doesn't seem to be tied directly to either gold or stocks and so having some BTC is a value add to the portfolio. Same deal with silver and international stocks. Over the long-term these assets have substantially different performance than gold, and so I believe they are worth holding. The variability between these three assets (gold/silver/btc) is much more than TSM/SCV and so the total volatility of the portfolio would be improved to a greater degree by using the former rather than the latter.
* Short-term bonds or cash is basically a waste of asset allocation. If I really wanted to, I would keep 6 months of expenses worth of cash emergency savings separate from my portfolio if I wanted to always have some cash on hand. 20% of total net worth in cash is just not a smart idea, especially if you have a high value portfolio....who needs that much cash on hand?

148,ID," Assuming that $1000 isn't money you need badly in the near future (say within 1 year from now), you can consider using 50-75% ($500-750) of it to get a 60/40 or 40/60 split (depending on your risk tolerance, but pick a target mix and stick with it) between stock ETFs and bond EFTs. Then activate the Dividend Re-Investment Program (DRIP) on them, so that any dividend or capital gains are reinvested into the ETF as fractional shares; that way, you earn compounding interest on shares (so 1 share will grow into 1.003 shares, for example, and etc.).

ETFs (exchange traded funds) are basically portfolios that are managed actively or passively by someone else on your behalf, when you buy a share in an ETF, you indirectly own the same stocks/bonds in that portfolio.

Here are some lessons I have picked up in the past year of trading:

1. ""Do not check your stock portfolio too often"": once you have invested your money, just forget about it for a while and go do something else. Check back in 1-3 months. You'll be happier this way, and get to do more productive things. Let the market do its work.
2. ""Invest through established brokers with a lot of liquidity and trading pools"": Vanguard, Fidelity, E\*Trade; try to avoid brokers that are aimed towards quick-fire trading like Robinhood or Webull, because you tend to get bad trades (i.e. shares bought at market price tend to be more expensive) and they usually don't have good customer service.
3. ""Do not buy investments in one go, buy over time"": FOMO is a bitch, but I have found that keeping some liquid money to buy investments over time and buy when the market is down (in a good stock of course), instead of a lump-sum, could have saved me some money.
4. ""If you can, place limit orders, not market orders"": limit orders ensure that you do not pay more than X amount for a share. Market order prices can fluctuate a lot because the broker prioritizes getting you the shares (although they are legally required to find the best lowest price).
5. ""Only invest what you can afford to lose"": when you make an investment, treat that money as spent or gone, because you have used it to buy an investment instrument. You'll be a lot happier this way, and you will not be tempted to trade emotionally.
6. ""Do not trade emotionally"": stock prices fluctuate over a month, this is normal, if you see a stock price crashing and your gains are in the negative, your heart might sink but it is usually a better strategy to hold (see next point).
7. ""You don't lose money as long as you do not buy high, sell low"": historically, investors have regained their value in a crash if they just held onto their investments long term (e.g. 1\~5 years, assuming they made good quality investments). Withdrawing your money by selling low means you confirmed that the lost sum is gone forever.

If you do need the money, some brokers allow you to sell shares by ""highest cost first"" or select the shares you want to sell by ID. Sell the share with the highest cost first, so that you pay less taxes on the sales (you'll only be taxed on gains, not the entire sales). Moreover, if you lose money on the sales, you can also claim a tax deduction, this is  why selling the highest cost share first is better if you need to withdraw the money.

149,MSM," Assuming that $1000 isn't money you need badly in the near future (say within 1 year from now), you can consider using 50-75% ($500-750) of it to get a 60/40 or 40/60 split (depending on your risk tolerance, but pick a target mix and stick with it) between stock ETFs and bond EFTs. Then activate the Dividend Re-Investment Program (DRIP) on them, so that any dividend or capital gains are reinvested into the ETF as fractional shares; that way, you earn compounding interest on shares (so 1 share will grow into 1.003 shares, for example, and etc.).

ETFs (exchange traded funds) are basically portfolios that are managed actively or passively by someone else on your behalf, when you buy a share in an ETF, you indirectly own the same stocks/bonds in that portfolio.

Here are some lessons I have picked up in the past year of trading:

1. ""Do not check your stock portfolio too often"": once you have invested your money, just forget about it for a while and go do something else. Check back in 1-3 months. You'll be happier this way, and get to do more productive things. Let the market do its work.
2. ""Invest through established brokers with a lot of liquidity and trading pools"": Vanguard, Fidelity, E\*Trade; try to avoid brokers that are aimed towards quick-fire trading like Robinhood or Webull, because you tend to get bad trades (i.e. shares bought at market price tend to be more expensive) and they usually don't have good customer service.
3. ""Do not buy investments in one go, buy over time"": FOMO is a bitch, but I have found that keeping some liquid money to buy investments over time and buy when the market is down (in a good stock of course), instead of a lump-sum, could have saved me some money.
4. ""If you can, place limit orders, not market orders"": limit orders ensure that you do not pay more than X amount for a share. Market order prices can fluctuate a lot because the broker prioritizes getting you the shares (although they are legally required to find the best lowest price).
5. ""Only invest what you can afford to lose"": when you make an investment, treat that money as spent or gone, because you have used it to buy an investment instrument. You'll be a lot happier this way, and you will not be tempted to trade emotionally.
6. ""Do not trade emotionally"": stock prices fluctuate over a month, this is normal, if you see a stock price crashing and your gains are in the negative, your heart might sink but it is usually a better strategy to hold (see next point).
7. ""You don't lose money as long as you do not buy high, sell low"": historically, investors have regained their value in a crash if they just held onto their investments long term (e.g. 1\~5 years, assuming they made good quality investments). Withdrawing your money by selling low means you confirmed that the lost sum is gone forever.
8. ""Only sell your investments if you need the money, and sell shares that cost you more first (to lower your taxes)"": If you don't need the money, it is better to hold onto an investment. If you do need the money, some brokers allow you to sell shares by ""highest cost first"" or select the shares you want to sell by ID. Sell the share with the highest cost first, so that you pay less taxes on the sales (you'll only be taxed on gains, not the entire sales). Moreover, if you lose money on the sales, you can also claim a tax deduction, this is  why selling the highest cost share first is better if you need to withdraw the money.

158,GOOG," My weekend update:

First a couple notes on underlying factors of the dollar and bonds. EUR/USD divergence a positive sign, but like oil a couple weeks ago divergences can get strung out before a correction play out. The dollar rally may be running out of steam and weakening soon. This will stop the headwind against stocks and metals. Junk bonds have jumped higher and could also be getting out of the way of a broad move higher in stocks. If HYG doesn’t make new highs and turns over after a brief rally, the correction in stocks is likely to continue.


Oil

Oil and services volatility has been extreme in the last week. I noted that after the initial drop this would be a difficult space to trade, but I didn’t see 5%+ daily swings coming. I do think a move higher is coming soon but following that it could struggle to make a new high so potential gains are limited. Then I expect a fall below current lows on increased selling pressure. Volatility will remain high throughout these moves so be ready for more unpredictable swings if you choose to play this space.


Silver

Silver on the edge of breakdown where buyers have shown strong support. This combination leads to quick extreme moves like the false breakdown Thursday morning. I think a bump higher from the support at 25 is likely as the dollar rally fades. If it loses steam quickly though a move under 25 in the coming weeks is still coming.


Stocks

As I’ve said before, I look for tech to lead stocks higher in the next bull phase. Having financials and travel doing well is nice, but won’t lead the broad market speculation needed to fuel this stage of the bull market. Semiconductors were up Friday, especially on the end of day spike. None of the big tech names are breaking out but if semis move I think other sectors could follow. Like oil and silver the key will be seeing if stocks can push to meaningful new highs or if this bump is a temporary buying bounce off of support that quickly fades and adds more selling pressure to the next breakdown attempt.


My plan

I remain a short term trader on In all positions until there is a more significant correction or a runaway move higher starts. This includes positions in UNG and EWJ I mentioned this week. Current bounces off support could last a few days or weeks. I expect them to be limited until recent trends are clearly broken. I’ll assume all action is sideways consolidation until we see some real breakouts and speculation like we did a couple months ago. Currently the only real sign of a change is the JNK action. There were also some strong reversals yesterday (BIDU was the biggest) which can mark a bottom. I want to see stocks like GOOG break it’s range higher to be confident in a sustainable rally. I’m taking short term profits and raising stops quickly as long as the general market risk of a breakdown exists.

162,NIO," I currently hold 100 shares of NIO at cost basis of $46.40.  I had a short put that was exercised and I was intending to purchase the stock at the time.

In regards to an entry point, that is best answered by your thesis.  I think a lot of traders / investors have found themselves in this position where there is so much information that surely, one of these pieces of information will be just exactly what I need.  Unfortunately, I don't think that's the case.  It's a better idea to form your own plan based on how you understand the underlying.  It's ok if you don't know everything, nobody does.  However, if you develop a plan on your own you have much more skin in the game and are more likely to follow through with the plan in the first place.

With that being said, here is my simple thesis:

1. As a trader, I prefer to sell volatility.  Selling calls in the current high volatility environment is a safer play than buying options.  Of course, you can sell puts or put credit spreads as well but I am comfortable owning the stock.
2. EV's aren't going away.  I want exposure to the EV market.  Having traded TSLA before, I would much rather play a less expensive underlying due to the size of my account.
3. Chinese underlyings are a double edged sword.  If you are aware of the risk, then it will be easier to know how to manage it.  You risk Chinese stocks being effectively regulated out of the US capital markets by way of more transparency with their reporting.  The trade relations between China and the rest of the world will always be used as a bargaining chip by either side until more common ground is found.  Even then, it is in the nature of sovereigns to find advantages for themselves.
4. I expect China to be able to maintain a much more effective supply chain in regards to industries that it favors.  The biggest difference in how other countries do this is this - China wants to be the best and blatantly moves towards that goal.  The rest of the world may not have the socioeconomic system that will facilitate a single minded goal like that.  Or simply, they don't have the desire to be the best.  They would rather focus on more provincial domestic issues.",directionalbias,3,/r/investing/comments/mea5ci/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/gsgkzxa/,0.027,0.838,0.135,0.9926
