0,ALL," My opinion, you can take these predictions along with professional ones and use it for toilet paper (not meant as direct attack on the OP).  NO ONE can predict what will happen in any market.  

Did anyone predict the market crash at start of 2020?  Did any of those same folks predict the market to go on a tear WHILE covid was/ is running rampant with no end in site last years?  Of those folks that did both of those how many thought penny stocks would be hot for the first several months of the year?  How many of those folks thought the penny land market would start freezing starting 1-2 months ago?   My guess is not many to NO ONE.   ALL of those things were just in the last 1-1.5 years.  

What helped me the most be a good long term investor is really comes to grip that NO ONE knows what will happen.  Here is my predictions based on all my experience in 10+ years of investing...

1.  Markets go up, down, and sideways and that is normal.
2.  NO ONE knows when any of the above will happen.

Once you accept NO ONE knows the future you become a better investor which is why you inherently believe in diversification.  Otherwise, you are always looking for and believing in false idols (you know how much the bible warns about that :))",10xwannabe,207,/r/pennystocks/comments/n4xzq2/now_is_not_the_time_to_be_long_remember_the/gwykb01/,0.105,0.861,0.034,-0.9408

5,BIG," Yes there are outliers.  Based on math (if you look at my example below of the coin flips).  A SMALL minority of folks have shown statistical significance AFTER the fact.  MORE folks have shown what looked like great aptitude of stock picking and then disappeared as you play out the rest of their stock picking careers.  Best example, Bill Miller of Legg Mason Trust.  He beat the SP500 for some 16 years in a ROW and then preceded to vastly UNDERPERFORM the index rest of his career.  Same for Oakmark.

How can that be?  It isn't just the fact luck vs. skill come into play.  One BIG reason the experts can NOT consistently beat the index is do to their own fame.  When they start out no one knows who they are.  They start to be successful.  So what happens?  They attract VAST amounts of $$$ to invest.  That is hard to do as they have to make investments in the MILLIONS from all the new cash they attract.  When they buy they are inherently pushing up the stock price on themselves and vice versa.  It is called ""market impact"".  

That is why an astute investor will always ask for ""dollar weighted returns"" vs. ""time weighted returns"" of a fund.  Meaning not what the fund did from date x to date y.  They will ask to see the fund size each year when those excellent returns are made.  If you do that you will find the market beating returns were when they were small and eroded/ lost when they became big based on their own success.  So if you weren't one of the first to find the small, unknown fund then you were still losing money out of the investment despite overall the numbers looking great.

BTW, Warren Buffett agrees with me and COUNTLESS times and again this year has said all his money for his wife is to be left 90% in SP500 and 10% in treasuries in his will.  Even he knows the chances of finding someone who can beat the market are RARE. 

Jack Bogle did an interesting analysis when he started the first index fund for retail investors in 1975 or so.  At that same time he looked at every equity mutual fund of the same type (large cap) and wrote them down.  Out of 350+ funds at that time do you know how many beat his index fund after only 25 years?  11-12 and how many beat it by 1-2% to account for higher costs (conservative estimate)? 5-6.  That is 5-6 over 350+ funds.  That is <2% chance of beating a simple index fund only after 25 years.  What are your chances of finding that 2% of funds AND finding them BEFORE they got big on a dollar weighted average?",10xwannabe,2,/r/pennystocks/comments/n4xzq2/now_is_not_the_time_to_be_long_remember_the/gx0p0ko/,0.032,0.844,0.123,0.9925

7,VERY," Please see my other comment.  Basically, yes there are a SMALL minority of folks who can do it, but how many are skill vs. luck.  So, you only find out who can consistently do it AFTER the fact.  Many start and then fall perils to ""market impact"".  Soy, you have to find them in advance as well be successful on a dollar weighted vs. time weighted return basis AND accounting for higher fees inherent in active management.  So, if you can get in a time machine then yes (ex post), but since you can only invest ex ante it is VERY difficult to find that needle in a haystack.  

See my comment on Jack Bogle's keeping a real life summary of how many folks beat his first index fund after only 25 years (only 1/2 of a person's investing lifespan).",10xwannabe,2,/r/pennystocks/comments/n4xzq2/now_is_not_the_time_to_be_long_remember_the/gx0pmtp/,0.031,0.822,0.147,0.949
8,BY," Please look at the MULTITUDE of the studies out there saying the same thing that NO ONE has accurately predicted the future market time after time.  Should be obvious since if they did they would be the richest person in the world BY FAR.

That INCLUDES Buffett and Munger.  They are active management investors in they perform ""security selection"" and NOT market timing.  PERFECT example of doing this once costing Buffett himself was last year with the airlines.  He thought the market going forward would suck so sold and look at the returns since.  His losses he took on it selling at the bottom+ lost returns on the way up is pretty staggering of that one market timing decision.  I am just using that as an example as he is a great investor based on SECURITY SELECTION and not timing the market.",10xwannabe,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/n4xzq2/now_is_not_the_time_to_be_long_remember_the/gx23fz8/,0.088,0.782,0.13,0.782

10,ANY," Great questions.

You are correct about taking on ANY single company investment (pennies or not).  I only invest in pennies that have catalysts where if they hit they become big.  So it isn't like I am hoping they naturally grow. over time.  If they hit their catalyst they will do well.  If not they will crash.  Simple as that.  Now if I was trying to just randomly pick penny stocks (or ANY stock for that matter) just hoping for natural organic growth over time greater then the general market then yes it would be TOTAL luck if it happens or not.  That is why I don't invest in pennies that way.  I only choose ones that have specific major catalyst.  The reason I ONLY do this with pennies as well because major money can't invest, i.e.  institutional, pensions, endowments, active funds, etc...  Trying to do this in the major markets would be nearly impossible.  There are so many EYES on every stock by professional money you aren't going to find a $20 bill lying on the street.

For the latter question they can just sell, but then they drop the price further down on every sell since again they are making a ""market impact"" due to their size.  Also, each of those sells are taxable to the investor which means LOWER overall post tax returns for the investor.  Also, adding too much cash adds a drag on forward returns.  The last 2 reasons is a sure fire way to underperform folks expectation (the reason they flooded in is due to your recent outperformance).  This leads to folks taking their money out to find the next great fund.  That makes more taxable distributions for the fund.  That means more folks getting upset and wanting to take their money out as well.  You see how this feeds upon itself?  Then, of course, the advisor and mutual fund ONLY makes money with increasing AUM so would not be happy as that means less $$$ for them.  Active management is so hard most folks don't even do that anymore.  They are just closet index funds and just charge A LOT more.",10xwannabe,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/n4xzq2/now_is_not_the_time_to_be_long_remember_the/gx29x2z/,0.077,0.837,0.087,0.1947

You can find penny stocks on boards like this or do a search for most active penny stocks.

DD is due diligence - don't take someone else's word on a 'tip' or a sure thing. Do your own research.

I use Ameritrade for OTC and Pinks. They charge $6 per transaction.

Penny stocks are incredibly volatile. After losing a chunk of change on a  handful of them, I've learned not to trade on any that have a market cap under 1 mil. Not to trade on any that have very little volume. And importantly, check the bid/ask prices before committing to one. I've bought a couple that had a bid price that stayed at 0, making it impossible to get rid of.

Watch this board, and others, to see what folks are suggesting (you'll start to recognize the ones who have been doing this for a while), then follow up with your own research. Do some paper trading to see how effective your trades are.

Again, I'm pretty new to this, but I've already learned from a few mistakes.",shervester,7,/r/pennystocks/comments/n564y7/the_lounge_thoughts_noob_stuff_low_effort_brokers/gx13ri4/,0.036,0.848,0.116,0.9393

81,RH," I see, thanks for the response. I do understand your situation - I originally started trading on RH for the same reasons. I don’t mean to come off as negative or  condescending, but if you don’t understand financial terminology and concepts, you are basically just gambling and risking losing all your money. If that really is the case for you, I would highly recommend investing in index funds or ETFs instead, where actual professionals can doing the “playing” for you for an insignificant fee. But of course, up to you!

If you’re a true beginner, you’ll find it hard to navigate Fidelity or ToS without additional research. They do have really good learning platforms where you can understand how the charting and apps work, though. I would also say that Webull is a great step up for a beginner, though they don’t currently support OTC stocks - but it’s a user-friendly interface with much more detail than RH, so you can get used to the terminology in a setting that’s easier on the eyes, prior to moving to a more traditional broker.
