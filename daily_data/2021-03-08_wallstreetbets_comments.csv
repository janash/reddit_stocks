CHORUS

Diamond Hands Rocket

Diamond Hands Rocket

Diamond Hands Rocket

Got the tendies in my pocket

Diamond Hands Rocket

Diamond Hands Rocket

Diamond Hands Rocket

Got the tendies in my pocket

VERSE 1

My bets, Wall Street

My trades, balls deep

GameStop, call sheet

Hedge funds, all cheat

Look at me, I‚Äôm the logo

Glasses, photo

Your crew, no show

My crew, YOLO


I don‚Äôt even care about the profits

I just wanna help put a nail in the coffin

Crony capitalism isn‚Äôt a free market

Sherriff of Nottingham in a Robinhood outfit


Mind set, don't care

Dead broke, been there

Can‚Äôt trade, unfair

Wall Street, beware


CHORUS
X2

VERSE 2

Tryna prey on the weak

but turn weak when you get preyed on

GME‚ÄÜgot DFV 

these diamond hands gon' stay strong

You stay short, we stay long

You say that we trade wrong

You doubled down 

You in trouble now 

Got your cashing burning like napalm 

How it‚Äôs supposed to work

Is when you place a bet

You take the risk

You make the profit

2008

You shit the bed

‚ÄúToo big to fail‚Äù

They bailed you out

We ate the losses

Payback‚Äôs a bitch

I bet you wish

You hedged your bets

Against these kids

But it‚Äôs too late now

Your day is done

Our time has come

Out with the old

In with the new

Wa me get paid now

66,GME," Good Morning Everyone!

For those just tuning in, we've had some interesting developments happening in Europe. [As you might remember from Friday](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lybuq0/gme_megathread_for_march_05_2021/gprt3y9/), we ended the day with an attack down to 130 before demand brought the price back up in dramatic fashion ending the week at 137.74. As markets open in Europe, we see demand for Gamestop has increased, pushing the price of GME beyond the 150 threshold. [This may be due to news that Cohen is leading the company's transition into e-commerce.](https://i.redd.it/v8230chfrsl61.png) The squeeze is currently in action and it will be interesting to see how the SHITers (Shorting Hedge Investors and Traders) will react once the markets open here at 9:30.

Available shorts are at 1,000,000 this morning. The things I am looking out for are the thresholds in which they will start shorting. Think of these as timeouts in basketball. If the momentum gets out of control, don't be surprise to see an attack to try and stifle the growth of the price. 

The SHITers are doing everything they can to prevent the amount of losses this squeeze will inflict on them. If they can't prevent the price from rising, they will try and elongate this squeeze as long as possible. What this means is that major price movements are going to occur either through an influx of new retail investors, or moves by the SHITers to manipulate the system. There may be hours of inactivity followed by minutes of action. Don't be surprised by this.

Regardless of what happens, please remember that any price drop you see is most likely manipulation on the SHITers end. As long as retail investors continue to buy and hold, the squeeze will continue.  Remember that GME started two weeks ago with a price of around $45. GME is currently $100 ahead. There will be turbulence, so please enjoy the ride.

I will edit this post with updates as I have the chance throughout the day.

Together, Ape Strong.

Short count is 600,000 as of 9:00. The attack we saw at the end of last week was most likely those 400,000 shorts. After all of that, we are starting the week at around 154. That's a lot of shorts that were sent out, and the stock is still rising strong. I wouldn't be surprised if we have a huge jump this week. I believe we are in the squeeze.

**10:02 update**

Holy volatility! GME started out the gate breaking the 160 line. Shorts dropped significantly falling as low as 140. The volatility continues as GME has gone up and down. I don't know if GME is stabalizing or if the volatility will contribute. Shorts available went up from 600,00 to 750,00 before dropping to 700,000. What we don't know it's how many orders were done in those 15 minute time frames. It looks like shorts were closed leading up to 750,000, but there could have been a series of opens and closes which ended it at 750,00. That might be the cause of the crazy volatility this past hour. It may be an attempt for the SHITers to hide their strategy by causing chaos in the system. Regardless the end eesult is shorts available at 700,000 and a new price region around 152.

Current price: 153.03

**10:37 Update**

More volatility, but GME is generally rising. More shorts have been opened, with available shares dropping 100,000 to 600,000. GME has been pushing towards 160. This seems really bad for the SHITs. If they're dropping shorts at the rate they are and the price is still steadily climbing, I don't know what strategy they have. We'll keep an eye out.

Current price: 160.84

**11:20 Update**

Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the GME Enterprise. We have achieved lift off and are proceeding to our next destination, Mars. Please remain seated, relax, and enjoy the ride. The SHITs threw another 50,000 shorts, with little to no affect. The upward pressure is only growing and GME is starting to break barriers quickly and efficiently. Please hold until we reach our destination. We may experience turbulence, but we assure you this is quite normal.

üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ

Current price: 182.23

**11:36 Update**

GME has pulled back from a high around 190 to around 175. This may be due to another 50,000 shorts that were opened these past 15 minutes. This is just a minor setback as upward pressure is still strong.

Current price: 177.74

**12:09 Update**

GME has stabalized for a bit around 180, but has been slowly creeping back up. No new shorts were opened according to IBorrowDesk, but the SHITs may be doing quick opens and closes to try and micromanage the situation. There are still 500,000 shares available, so don't be surprised of another drop, however it seems that GME has reached a new established price range around 180. Watch for an attack in the next hour to try and get Retail Investors to panic sell during lunch. Remember this is all just another day on the GME express. There is still a lot of upward pressure that will not release until most of the shorts are closed.

Current price: 185.57


**12:37 Update** 

üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ GME has broken 200. No new shorts have opened. Please hold.

Current price: 202.27

**12:51 Update**

GME almost broke 210 before falling just below 200. This was most likely due to 50,000 shorts that were opened before 12:45. However, the price stabalized around 200 and there is still heavy pressure. I don't see how the SHITs bring this down without some serious firepower. Simply shorting seems to only delay the inevitable rise. 

Shorta available: 450,000

Current price: 200.65

**1:05 Update**

GME dropped before 190, however another 50,000 shorts were opened. The SHITers are at 400,000 remaining. We'll see whether GME continues it's climb after another sedative shot or if it will stabalize. Buying pressure has been strong all day and I don't see how this trend doesn't continue through the week. They've used 200,000 so far today and nothing has been able to stop the ascent. What happens when they run out shorts? We might find out soon.

Shorts available: 400,000

Current price: 185.76

**1:27 Update**

GME has stabalized around 185. No new shorts were opened. I'm getting off of lunch so my updates may take some more time. 

Shorts available: 400,000

Current price: 184.03

**1:49 Update**

Still stabalized at around 183. Still no new shorts opened. 

Shorts available: 400,000

Current price: 182.34

**2:25 Update**

We saw an interesting thing. Price went down to below 170 before climbing back up to 183. The available shorts stayed the same. One possibility might be that they opened and closed shorts within the 15 minute span. That might explain the drop that GME had with the quick rebound. If so, they're trying new strategies.

Shorts available: 400,000

Current price: 185.33

**2:53 Update**

GME has stabalized. Nothing has changed with shorts. I anticipate GME staying around 185 until we get another shift somewhere. It's a virtual standstill.

Shorts available: 400,000

Current price: 185.49

**3:30 Update**

Upward pressure has taken hold again. GME has broken the 190 barrier again and is ascending upwards. No short change. Power hour is in full force. This is probably my last update before closing bell. I'll make comments on my break after the Bell.

182,AM," 09:42 AM EST, 03/08/2021 (MT Newswires) -- GameStop(GME) has formed a board committee to look for ways to speed up the video game and console retailer's transition and push toward more e-commerce, putting Chewy (CHWY) founder Ryan Cohen at the head of the group.

Grapevine, Texas-based GameStop(GME), which has had wide swings in its stock price this year after grabbing the attention of retail investors, said the Strategic Planning and Capital Allocation Committee will include Cohen as chair as well as Alan Attal and Kurt Wolf. The company's shares jumped 9.8% in early Monday trading and are up 631% so far in 2021.

""The committee will continue to focus on identifying actions that can transform GameStop(GME) into a technology business and help create enduring value for stockholders,"" GameStop(GME) said in a statement on Monday. ""It is responsible for evaluating areas that include GameStop's(GME) current operational objectives, capital structure and allocation priorities, digital capabilities, organizational footprint, and personnel.""

GameStop (GME) didn't say when the committee was formed, but said it's already taken steps that include appointing a chief technology officer and hiring two people to lead the company's customer care and e-commerce fulfillment functions. They also announced a succession plan for chief financial officer and the start of a search for a CFO with technology or e-commerce experience. The company said on Feb. 23 that CFO Jim Bell would be leaving on March 26.

Cohen joined the board in January, bringing along Attal, who also worked at Chewy, the online-based pet-food retailer. At the time of their appointment, GameStop(GME) said Cohen's RC Ventures was one of its largest investors. Wolf is the chief investment officer at Hestia Capital Management and joined the board in 2020, according to GameStop's(GME) website.

In GameStop's(GME) fiscal third quarter through the end of October, e-commerce sales jumped 257%, although net sales were still down 30% to just over $1 billion. It's yet to announce a release date for fiscal fourth-quarter results.

GameStop (GME) stayed quiet as traders fueled by online forum Reddit's WallStreetBets group sought to disrupt short-selling practices and drive those investors to close out their positions in shares of companies like GameStop(GME). The matter became the subject of a hearing by US lawmakers last month that included testimony from Keith Gill, the Reddit user who drove much of the forum's attention on GameStop(GME).",ionized_fallout,46,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m0fpgd/gme_megathread_for_march_08_2021/gq7rp4z/,0.0,0.94,0.06,0.9559

...it's not like Gamestop doesn't have e-commerce already. Any company, they say e-com all the time on TV about Nike, Lululemon etc. etc. and how it's driving more revenue.....but seriously how do you ramp up e-com???  


1. spend a ton of $$ on advertising
2. better UX on website (spend $$ for better eng, UX researches, design team)
3. exclusive bundle offerings? (spend more $$ to companies to get this)

All of the things you'd need to do to improve your e-com would cost a ton of money.

349,GME," The short positions have to cover their shorts at some point. Which means they have to purchase the shares. If the share price goes up astronomically, it starts to get so large that the number of dollars they have to have is so big, it's larger than the entire market. 

There are 60 million shares (or something) of GME. If every share is worth $100, GME is worth 6 billion. If we hit 1k, GME is worth 60 billion. If we hit 10k, GME is worth 600 billion - almost as big as Amazon at a trillion. If we hit 100k, GME is worth 6 trillion. 

There was (back in Jan, idk what it is now, I heard over 400% recently-ish) over 100% shares shorted. That means if they have to cover all short positions, these hedge funds will have to come up with over 100% of 6 trillion dollars when GME is at 100k. They will all have to liquidate their positions in the entire stock market to pay for that. If every hedgie short GME sells everything they own to cover their debts, the market will freefall so hard it makes covid drop and the great depression look like a boring Tuesday.  People would lose 90% of their 401ks. 

This will not be allowed to happen. The people making the rules have a vested interest in not having the entire market collapse. So, they will halt trading. They will expend deadlines and NOT make people cover their shorts. They will allow shorts to be rolled over indefinitely. Whatever they do, you can be sure that GME will not hit some ridiculous astronomical number like 100k. It could, maybe, hit 1k without fucking the entire system. Order of magnitude, 10k, starts the freefall. 100k is DarkDoomDoom.",snapcracklesplat,9,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m0ek5v/gamestop_gme_said_to_tap_chewycoms_cohen_to_lead/gq8lukk/,0.058,0.804,0.139,0.9592

422,PS," since you bring it up - yesterday i was in a hurry and didnt have time to shower - so i decided to just spray some Dr Scholl's Foot deodorant on my balls and taint - TERRIBLE IDEA! Do not try that shit at home! I was already in my car starting down the street before I realized how bad that shit burned and I swear to god i couldnt see cause my eyes were watering like a hedge fund owner shorting gee emm mee.

It was like the devil him self got up in my shorts and rubbed my butthole with icy hot while giving me a reach around with jabanero peppers on the scrotum. I tried to drive down the street to get to a bathroom but the shit was burning so bad I had to pull off the side of the road - almost crashed into a car and had to wipe that shit off - but i had no rags in my car so i had to take off my f..ing sock to wipe my balls with. Luckily i had a bottle of water in my car so I could wet the sock - but I didn't plan that out too properly and ended up spending half the day walking funny cause my balls hurt and I had one sock on. I went to dollar tree at lunch and bought 99cents worth of new socks but the one that saved my testicles will be going into a well earned retirement.

427,GME," You build long term holders by keeping the short term holders happy tho. If more short term people want to see these hfs fail and really remember GME forever and have faith that their interests are of concern then they will stay. Think about the ones who lost a shitton of money that are waiting for big returns or at least to get back to even...and Sure some will cash out but once the hfs have to spend more for their shares and people take their profits they‚Äôll come back in to help stabilize it. For me it doesn‚Äôt matter I don‚Äôt have enough skin in the game so I‚Äôm just an outsider observer trying to figure out why we‚Äôre letting the hfs catch up because you know they‚Äôre stacking shares now in case this does blow up and if nothing happens soon then nothing will happen other than people wait for the company to improve and hopefully in 2-3 years everything is on course and the price rises to reflect it‚Äôs true value...but in the meantime it would be nice to see them do something good for the shareholders that kept the company alive and sink the hfs. 

Just feels like any chance of making this happen is fading by every day because no matter what price it gets to the longer this drags on the more opportunity for the hfs to stack shares at this price just in case. Just my opinion of course but that‚Äôs kinda what I feel would be happening behind closed doors because if it does shoot up the hfs will have all the shares they‚Äôve been stacking too so their loss wont be as great and they have more time to move gme into etfs to spread out the losses that way as well.",TopGolfMike,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m00gqa/i_got_a_sign_from_aboveall_the_dd_i_needed/gq67lim/,0.066,0.75,0.184,0.99

More than ever demonstrating  
How to give a WallStreetBettin' aut-ience  
a feeling like it‚Äôs levitating  
Never trading,  
and I know that the gaybears

Type in ‚ÄúLosers Sell‚Äù and make 'em lose it

I don't know what terms to use.

It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you  
How many purses I gotta purchase to  
Prove that if you were half as iced,  
your shlong might cease being a virgin, dude.  GUH!  
School flunkie, pill junky  
But look at the ALPO-plays  
the skills brung me  
Full of dog food, but still hungry  
I bully myself 'cause I make me do  
what I put my coins to  
And I'm a million leagues below you,  
ill when I speak in tongues  
But it's still tongue in cheek: GUH *whew*  
I‚Äôm sunk so Tesla take the fucking wheel,  
I'm asleep in the front seat  
Pumping Double-D‚Äôs with the Boys,  
still chunky butt funky  
But in my head there's something  
I can feel tugging and struggling  
Elon fights with da Bears and,  
here's what they want from E:  
They asking E to eliminate  
some of the ICE-y hate  
But if you take into consideration  
the bitter hatred He has  
Then you may be a little patient  
and more sympathetic to the situation  
And understand the diss to the nation  
Buttfuck it, Ford's handing us lemons,  
buy ELONmade then.  
But if E can't better the OEMen  
how the fuck is he supposed  
to buy them a stake then?  
Don't mistake him for Satan  
It's a fatal mistake  
if you think he needs to be overseein‚Äô  
Or take a vacation to help a Ford  
And make Ford fall on it‚Äôs face;

Look,

Something‚Äôs right, I can feel it.   
Six minutes, stop trading, you Aut....  
Just a feeling I‚Äôve got,  
like something‚Äôs about to happen,  
but I don‚Äôt know what. 
If this means what I think it means,  
then we‚Äôre in a bubble, big bubble.  
The market‚Äôs as bananas as you say,

You were just what the Don ordered.  

I‚Äôm beginning to feel like a Streetard

All my tendies from last month:

Now who thinks their ARM‚Äôs

My mortgage needs stock hops;  
so calls on GameStop.  

But for me to be a true Autist,  
must be in my genes.    
I got a laptop in my back pocket  
Robinhood app will go off when I have profit  
Gotta fat cock from that dip stoppin‚Äô  
Made a livin and a killin off it

440,UPS," I wrote this awhile but it never took off: 

Rap God remix

[Intro] 
Look,  
I was gonna buy Yeezys with GOOG   
and make some extra tendies...  
But I‚Äôm only going to get this one chance  
Something‚Äôs right, I can feel it.   
Six minutes, stop trading, you Aut....  
Just a feeling I‚Äôve got,  
like something‚Äôs about to happen,  
but I don‚Äôt know what. 
If this means what I think it means,  
then we‚Äôre in a bubble, big bubble.  
The market‚Äôs as bananas as you say, 
and I‚Äôm still taking chances.  
You were just what the Don ordered.  

I‚Äôm beginning to feel like a Streetard  
Streetard.  
All my tendies from last month:  
I discard  
Discard  
Now who thinks their ARM‚Äôs  
long enough to chance drops  
My mortgage needs stock hops;  
so calls on GameStop.  

But for me to be a true Autist,  
must be in my genes.    
I got a laptop in my back pocket  
Robinhood app will go off when I have profit  
Gotta fat cock from that dip stoppin‚Äô  
Made a livin and a killin off it  
Ever since JPowell was still in office  
With machines going BRRRRRR into a fat sack  
I am obscene but I‚Äôm honest,  
But as rude and indecent as call-bells. 
Sellables  
Teslaholic (TSLA all in)  
Stock tickerty, Giga-D, hibbedy hip hop  
You don't really wanna get into a pissing match  with this RKTy brat  
Hacking a Mac in the back of the ‚ÄòShack,  
backpack: stacks, crack, yep, yackidy-yac  
And at the exact same time a bee see‚Äôs these  miracle Alphabet stunts while I'm buzzing  
That I'll still be able to make a put  
when things are stable  
Go forth and back with a couple of options  
that leave me with half.  
Only realized it was ironic I had alpha bet  Alphabet after the fact.  
How come I‚Äôm not pro?  
All I do is watch F bomb,  
see my math was just wack.  
Gay bears are having a rough time period,  
here's a Maxipad  
I‚Äôm actually disastrously bad:  
SoDakZak: who I'm masterfully constructing  
this masterpiece as...  

I‚Äôm beginning to feel like a Streetard  
Streetard.  
All my tendies from last month:  
I discard  
Discard  
Now who thinks this man‚Äôs dumb enough  
and has ARD: hazard  
Let me show you maintaining this sub  
ain't that hard, that hard  

Everybody want the key  
and the secret to stonk immortality  
like I have got  
Well, to be truthful the blueprint's  
simply calls and useless exuberance  
Everybody loves to root for their new cents  
Hit that Coke, KO, ass destroyed,  
did nothing but shoot for the moon since!  
MBSs get taken to school with these options  
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to bus the prime!  
Now I lead a new school full of students  
Me? I'm a product of rockin‚Äô  
Lockheed, Exxon, to back N- 
-K-E, *lube*, hey,  
stock BUD hella easy,  
thank you, they got Lin  
Inspired enough to one day grow UPS,  
put UPS and be in a position  
To eat buns (MCD) 
and induct them into the  
Mc-uh-Lovin' Stock n' Sold Hall of Fame  

Even though iStockin‚Äô the merch  
and purse an iBall of gains  
Only Hall of Fame I be inducted in 
is the Apple hall of shame  
With their Jobs-less claims.    
You lads think it's all a game  
'til iSPY your stock with claims  
Laugh off banking,  
tell me who in the Fed are you thanking?  
Little gay looking bear  
So gay I can barely say it  
with a straight face looking bear  
You witnessing a massacre  
Like you watching a church gathering  
take place looking bear  
Oy vey, that boy's play,  
that's all I‚Äôll say looking boy  
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back  
And a ""way to go you‚Äôre disabled‚Äù  
everyday looking boy  
Hey, loser boy, wanna play loser boy?  
I got a ""hell yeah, all day!‚Äù loser boy  
I'mma work for everything I have  
Never ask nobody for shit,   
get outta my face loser boy  
Basically boy you're never gonna be capable  
To keep up with the same pace loser boy.  

‚ÄòCause I‚Äôm beginning to feel like a Streetard, Streetard.  
The way I'm racing around Wall Street,  
call me Nascar, Nascar  
Dale Earnhardt of the Central Park,  
the White Trash God  
Kneel before JPowell and spread it,  
strip down; no ass guard, ass guard  
So you‚Äôll be sore and I'll be holdin,  
you rode him, economy potent  
Puts often: I'm reloading,  
immediately with DIS bombs I'm totin'  
Robinhood is always broken.  
I'm the walking dead,  
but I'm just a talking head,  
a zombie floating  
But I got you bears deep throating  
Rub out my robbin‚Äô noodle,  
we have stocks in common, google  
I'm a sober man,  
pinch your salt and a lime  
and drink Jos√©, burro.  
It's me, my honesty's brutal  
But it's honestly futile  
if I don't utilize what I do though  
For good at least once in a while  
So I wanna make sure somewhere  
in this rippin‚Äô stash I sniffle and snoodle  
Enough times to maybe to  
try and help get some people  
through tough times  
But I gotta keep a few cokelines  
just in case 'cause even you un-fined  
SNAPpers are hungry looking at me  
like it's lunchtime  
I know there was a time where one guy  
Was king of WallStreetBets,  
but I still cap like I'm on my Palantir calls grind  
So at lunch time,  
I eat the plants you combine  
Appear with teeth the color of dimes  
I got too big and here they come trying to  
CRSPR you like that one line  
I snort, say ‚ÄúI'm Back‚Äù from the bathroom: U-P  
Hun, when I tried to say  
I'll take seven nugs from Calls; I‚Äôm buyin‚Äô  
Put 'em all in a line,  
add an A1, 57, a Ray‚Äôs bottle and the Heintz  
See if I get away with it now  
that I ain't as long as I was, but I'm  
Morphin' into an immortal  
coming through Zuck‚Äôs portal  
You're stuck in a damn short  
from 2004 though  
And I don't know what the hyuk  
that you goof for  
You're pointless as Jeff Bezos  
with fucking cornrows  
You play normal,  
Zuck‚Äôs being normal.  
And I just bought a new rail gun  
from the future  
Just to train and shoot ya like when  
Elon Musk made LA mad  
'Cause Dad said they looked like a drag  
at rush hours: sad.  
Blingin' like a Chad while they placate E,  
ya know  
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special  
on the cable channel  
So JPow went straight to the radio station  
the very next day  
""Hey, Bears, I'mma kill you""  
Currency coming at you at supersonic speed,  (JPow Dad)  
‚ÄúUh, sit down Elon here‚Äôs a comma,  
 you assuming I'm a human  
What I gotta do to get it through to you:  
I'm superhuman  
Innovative and I'm made to borrow  
So that anything I  say is repo trading  
off The Street and it'll go to you  
Investigating?  
More than ever demonstrating  
How to give a WallStreetBettin' aut-ience  
a feeling like it‚Äôs levitating  
Never trading,  
and I know that the gaybears  
are forever waiting  
For the day that they can say I fell off,  
they'd be celebrating  
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated  
I make quantitative easing,  
Leaves you qualitative wheezing  
Oh, he's on livestream  
Well, that's what they do when the coronavirus,  makes them use it.  
It's not drip drop, or pop,  
'cause trickle down bubbles won‚Äôt refuse it  
We rock: bought yachts and docks  
Type in ‚ÄúLosers Sell‚Äù and make 'em lose it  
I don't know how to make gains like that. 
I don't know what terms to use.  
Let me know when it occurs to you  
While I'm zipping any one of these purses:   
Diverse? Hurts you.  
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you  
How many purses I gotta purchase to  
Prove that if you were half as iced,  
your shlong might cease being a virgin, dude.  GUH!  
School flunkie, pill junky  
But look at the ALPO-plays  
the skills brung me  
Full of dog food, but still hungry  
I bully myself 'cause I make me do  
what I put my coins to  
And I'm a million leagues below you,  
ill when I speak in tongues  
But it's still tongue in cheek: GUH *whew*  
I‚Äôm sunk so Tesla take the fucking wheel,  
I'm asleep in the front seat  
Pumping Double-D‚Äôs with the Boys,  
still chunky butt funky  
But in my head there's something  
I can feel tugging and struggling  
Elon fights with da Bears and,  
here's what they want from E:  
They asking E to eliminate  
some of the ICE-y hate  
But if you take into consideration  
the bitter hatred He has  
Then you may be a little patient  
and more sympathetic to the situation  
And understand the diss to the nation  
Buttfuck it, Ford's handing us lemons,  
buy ELONmade then.  
But if E can't better the OEMen  
how the fuck is he supposed  
to buy them a stake then?  
Don't mistake him for Satan  
It's a fatal mistake

I do not invest. I started following this sub after GME for shits and giggles.

But I did study economics. I don't have a degree on it, but I know the basic market structures that exist.

The commoner is becoming more educated, which is democratizing the stock market. What happened with GME were the basic market forces in place: law of demand and supply.

Collusion happens when in an oligopoly, a handful of large market shareholders put barriers in place, create predatory pricing practices to drive the small shareholders out of the market, which allows the large ones to gain larger share of the market.

Calling what happened to GME collusion is spitting in the face of economics.

749,AMC," AMC spent most of the past 6-7 years above $15, and spent much of that time in the $20's and $30's.  Movie-going was gradually declining, but after COVID people will be desperate for something social to do, especially for dates.

More importantly, COVID killed off a lot of AMC's competitors while AMC spent the time improving.  AMC is basically the only game in town in many areas.  Its only real competition around me is from the Showcase Cinema de Lux theaters, which are more expensive.

That means they‚Äôre not going to be able to HOLD long term and will probably have to sell some or all of their positions starting the 3rd week of march. Because they have no other income, they‚Äôre using the only money they have (which should be for housing, essentials, and bills) to buy stocks hoping they‚Äôll get rich quick. But their housing and other bills will be due on Apr 1.   This is why I don‚Äôt think GME or any other meme stonk will go to the moon (ie $1000) anytime soon. Too many here don‚Äôt actually have investible funds that they can leave in the market for more than a few weeks.

For fuck sake

AMC is in such a worse position than GME I'm so fed up of having to repeat it.

Stop lumping all stocks together.

You know what, I'm literally glad that AMC is printing for some people. But stop mentioning it every time GME moves.

GME has new leadership, new direction, shrinking unprofitable highstreet stores and a BOOMING industry to explore.

AMC has huge debts, no new leadership, no new direction, no reorganising of cinema's or screens and a stagnated industry to ex*ploit*.

AMC is voting to dilute shares an additional 500mm from Class B to Class A

AMC has a *much* higher float than GME, with a much lower proportional volume of shares shorted

$200bn industry vs $17bn industry

Competitors to gaming *industry*? Dude... if a global catastrophe showed anything... it made games PUMP higher.

Competitors to movie theatre industry? Home theatres, HBO (and potentially) Netflix, Amazon

You didn't see Mark Cuban doing an AMA about AMC.

You didn't see Roaring Kitty with a position on AMC.

1107,UE," I'm surprised nobody has mentioned one of the biggest reasons to be bearish on $DASH.

&#x200B;

It's Costco.

&#x200B;

First, yes, the stock is overpriced even if it has absolutely zero headwinds facing it.  Hell, they're not even a novel business concept.  Everybody thinks these delivery services are new, but a company called Takeout Taxi was doing this over 30 years ago.  But back to Costco.

&#x200B;

Walk into one.  Uber Eats has partnered with them, and $COST is selling $100 Uber Eats gift cards for 80 bucks.  Not with the other gift cards, oh no...right up front by the fucking registers so everybody sees them.

&#x200B;

Why would I pay full price for an overpriced service when I can get the exact same service for 20% less?  And that's ignoring the fact that, if you have an AMEX Platinum card, you get the premium UE experience with the $0 delivery charge (still the stupid service charge), as well.  And the monthly credit from AMEX?

&#x200B;

There are a lot of reasons to be bearish on $DASH, but chief amongst them is how poorly positioned they are in their own sector.  That said, I'm not sure I see a play here short of flat-out shorting.  The puts are too expensive.

1139,TV," People are dying to go back to the old ways of commerce ( actually going out to eat inside a restaurant ).   Its an experience that you can't replicate with delivery.   By the time your food gets to you, even if its still warm, its never as good any more.     
If you ever watched Hell's Kitchen, you know that great restaurants time the exact delivery of every item on your plate so it arrives perfectly cooked and ready to be enjoyed immediately.    Gordon is constantly tossing stuff away and making them recook it because another portion of the dish wasn't finished in time / too early / ect.   Granted some of this is drama for TV but its also true.

So now imagine after all of this, your perfectly cooked dish gets to sit in a warming zone for 15-30 min to get delivered to you.   No thanks.

Also, unless you have free doordash credit from work or something, if you factor in all the fees and driver tip.   You're paying more to get food you'll need to reheat at home or have been sitting warm in a bag .. rather than eating in at restaurants and getting the full experience for cheaper.",lampstax,19,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m039gr/doordash_dash_is_going_to_be_bloodred_this_week/gq5xi6v/,0.02,0.811,0.169,0.9855

The odds of an exponential return are extremely high. BUT what really makes BB so special is that at this price the risk is incredibly low. Assuming no market crash the risk is as close to nil as is possible. Extremely rare to get this kind of upside potential with such limited risk.

You're right, it is a Covered Put. A redditor corrected me.

The Put gives the synthetic shareholder flexibility to buy real GME shares to cover shorts without dismantling the synthetic share.

The answer is that hedge funds and other shortsellers physically cannot cover their shortsales, because GME holders aren't selling their shares for cheap.

Hedge funds can 'kick the can down the road' and delay the short squeeze, but can not stop the squeeze from happening.

&#x200B;

1. Change the laws to cancel the short squeeze.

1319,CEO," We're in a bit of a grey area, and there's multiple ways to look at this, so apologies in advance if we end up talking in circles.

First, I don't think Melvin can say that his short position is closed if it's only been covered with a synthetic long position. It's a factually inaccurate statement that would get him in pretty deep shit lying to congress. Either he's short shares or they closed the position by obtaining shares in the market (via executed options, or just buying shares).  He could say he's covered with this position, but if he said he closed the positions, there's a major difference and I don't think corporate lawyers would allow the CEO to lie to congress.

Second, IF Melvin is short 100 shares and IF Melvin uses a synthetic long to cover, even if the stock skyrockets, Melvin doesn't make a shitload of profit. They actually don't make anything, because at the end of the day, they owe those 100 shares to whoever they were borrowed from, no matter if the stock is $1 or $1,000, no matter if the call was $0.01 ITM or $999 ITM. And they can't sell the option early to profit, otherwise they're no longer covered.

The only way I can see Melvin Capital unfucking their situation is to buy more call options than shares they've shorted. If they're short 100 shares and buy 2 calls, or take 2 synthetic long positions, then they'd make bank in the event of a price increase.",Faedro,7,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m08xbn/explaining_gme_synthetic_long_shares_aka_fake/gq6vswj/,0.044,0.833,0.123,0.9524

1352,XOM," A note of caution on such long dated calls. This move in oil is likely short term. It can last the summer, but after that is anyone's guess. OPEC+ has taken a lot of production off the table...and it can bring it back. US production is unlikely to increase drastically, but it's only 2.5 mbpd below pre-pandemic highs. 

The headwinds have not disappeared. Oil stocks are becoming more and more unattractive as investments. The impacts on demand from economies turning away from carbon-based forms of energy is tough to predict. Geopolitics -- like an Iran deal -- will move the markets. Etc. 

In short, a 2023 seems less certain than a Jan 22. Personally, I've just sold off a number of XOM calls bought last October/November and hedged the rest.

The immediate supply and demand forces on oil are going to be favorable for a little bit, but the market doesn't only react to the immediate pressures and there is a lot of room for news releases that could negatively impact price movement.

1367,XOM," Saudis stated they would return their oil gradually beginning in April. If opec thought global demand could consume more oil without the possibility of another glut they would have increased production. I‚Äôm not going to do the math, but I assume 7-8 million barrels with an average price 50-70 is more money than current production at $70-80. They all want more money for their domestic economies. Futures curve is also currently in backwadation which literally illustrates that prices in the future are cheaper in the future. I get being bullish and I‚Äôm long XOM shares, but there seems to be a misunderstanding that this run is demand related. It is purely supply and the major producer countries are not comfortable with the demand forecast or they would have put more production on the market. If you look at crude stockpiles we are still above 5 year average.

1433,IMO," I think there are two main factors to consider. First, demand will rebounce, due to the limitations the pandemic imposed on every day lives. This won't last forever most likely, but will have a big impact in the upcoming months/couple of years. In this time people will go back to theaters just as a way to socialize. 
Second, movies in theaters are a lot more profitable than streaming for producers. Take for example Netflix: 25 b in 2020 in revenues. As 2020 was a great year for them. No doubt that 25 b is a very large sum, but if you compare it to the (quite impressive) number of Netflix original productions released every year, that number is not that so large anymore. It is way more profitable to release in theaters.
IMO the combination of these two things will push producers to release more in theaters in the upcoming months.",drestonxyz,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m0eqv8/may_the_force_be_with_you_amc_management_is_at/gq8i06w/,0.052,0.823,0.124,0.9278

From what I understand of it (perhaps im wrong please argue if so):

the DTCC in the event of a default or massive loss event by one of its members, can literally jack every last dime out of this defaulting member. If total assets of this member are not enough to cover the loss, DTCC reserves the right to collect a share of the liquidity required to cover this loss event from each and every one of its members and partners. At this point we are talking a pool of tens of trillions. 

If by some miracle this weren‚Äôt enough (never gonna happen), there is further insurance in the tens of trillions to cover the loss.  

All of the absurd price points are theoretically possible in a vacuum where a a majority of shareholders do that thing they do and hold their shares while shorts are squeezed. Were such a situation to play out in reality, there is more than enough money to cover absurd (yes, even six figure) prices.  In practice, when this all plays out, I have my doubts about the amount of psychological resilience people have to hold to crazy numbers, and it may be that many fold long before. You are a good example.

However, given that we are seeing a situation play out where there are potentially so many short positions and synthetic longs that some-to-many of the real outstanding shares may need to be bought more than once to cover, it may be the case that not as many need to have those kind of balls to see these numbers.

1507,SI," But none of these numbers will make gamestop worth more than the total market even if we use your number of 70 trillion - a quick Google search show that it is at least 85 trillion - which is just availlable capital.

If we use the number of 1\*10\^(6) as the price and we assume that there are 70\*10\^(6) shares then:

1\*10\^(6)\*70\*10\^(6)=7\*10\^(12)

which is equal to 70 trillion.

If we use the SI number they have provided rounded up to 25 %. If that is true they ""only"" need to cover this amount maximum.

0.25\*70 trillion = 17.5 trillion

That mean that $1 M / share is 20-25% of the total market which is high but possible.

100-500 K is definetly possible as it is less than 2.5-12.5 % of the total markets worth.

This is why this potentially could cause a financial crisis - But this is not the retail traders fault it is the HF that shorted the stock.

Based on our assumptions we know that this number is exacturated as all values that was used where higher that the ones reported. The only reason this could be wrong is if the HF have provided a wrong SI number ....

1557,PLTR," In your analogy the only way Palantir can give you a proper answer is if they already programmed the alternative options and used the algorithm to optimize for the best outcome. It's not magic, it's not groundbreaking, it's just fking enterprise software using statistics and bunch of other algorithms to get you the answer. Plenty of enterprise software companies do that. 

The reason to invest in PLTR is because of the portfolio of clients Palantir is amassing and the momentum they have. This software is a pain in the ass to replace. Buyers put their reputations on the line when they select Palantir. The high switching costs make this a great business in the long run.

Palantir specializes in deepfuckingdata analyses mainly for governmental clients. what does that mean? It means, for example, that to get detailed info on someone, all you would need is a name and license plate number and Palantir does the rest. It performs a deep search of all criminal, financial, medical, communication, and clandestine agency records on the target. 

The company‚Äôs tech helped locate Osama bin fucking Laden in 2011 and is being used to trace COVID-19 infections, track medical supply chains, and even predict outbreaks in pandemic hot zones.

44-48. Why? Because my calls break even next year at 34 and damnit I want those puppies to print! No scientific or mathematical reasoning involved. I like money.

But to address your specific question on 3-5yr. I think the factors governing that can and will be seen in the next month or two and that'll give a better indication on what to expect.

1. The blowout sale of PLTR goes on for another 1-2 weeks. Then the price stabalizes around 25-27 and carries through April/May +or-$2

2. The tax benefits from reducing team size in the former HQ start to hit bottom line. Although I noticed they still have a large number of job postings there, but the Denver move is still new so we'll see.

3. Partnership and contract announcements in the double digit millions.

4. In the very long term successful completion of the existing gov contracts will hopefully spur positive sentiment in the Biden administration. Who is, at his core, a if it ain't broke don't fix it guy.

I see my aggressive strategy as hinging on an infrastructure deal being passed, but this company along with US Steel are positioned for a lot of success in the coming years regardless. 

One more thing I want to add regarding the infrastructure deal, a lot of the concern over its passing is attributed to how it gets funded. The American Petroleum Institute is [on the brink of advocating for a carbon tax](https://www.wsj.com/articles/oil-trade-group-considers-endorsing-carbon-pricing-11614640681).

While the substantial increase in futures pricing will help with some contracts renewing presently, futures need to hold $1000+ thru 2022 for this to really bring a substantial boost.

That said, LG is #**STEEL** and CLF is currently the largest holding in my portfolio across a few accounts.

Some googling brought me to this copy paste from the International Iron metallics association 

The Use of Hot Briquetted Iron (HBI) in the Blast Furnace (BF)
for Hot Metal Production
HBI can be used as blast furnace burden material with the following environmental, 
productivity and cost benefits:
‚Ä¢ lower carbon dioxide emissions
‚Ä¢ increased blast furnace productivity (increase of about 8% for each 10% increase in
burden metallisation)
‚Ä¢ reduced coke rate (decrease of about 7% for each 10% increase in burden metallisa-
tion)
Reasons for HBI Charging into the Blast Furnace
Various circumstances under which including HBI in the BF burden 
could have a positive economic effect:
‚Ä¢ Output limit of a BF based on pellets and sinter has been reached and the downstream steel
mill has excess capability. Increase of hot metal production can be achieved without addi-
tional investment.
‚Ä¢ Coke production capacity is limited and capital expenditure on coke ovens is not viable.
Therefore, the plant needs to reduce specific coke consumption.
‚Ä¢ Purchased coke is used, but the price is sufficiently high to enable a reduced coke consump-
tion to offset higher cost when adding HBI to the BF burden.
‚Ä¢ Out of several BF‚Äôs, one BF must be relined, so increased hot metal production is required
from the remaining BF‚Äôs to minimize downstream production losses.
‚Ä¢ There is an imbalance between the required tonnage of hot metal and BF capacity: the
plant operates three BF‚Äôs when the hot metal output of somewhere between two and three
BF‚Äôs would be sufficient. Therefore, it can be economical to operate two BF‚Äôs at slightly
higher hot metal cost in order to optimize production of downstream facilities.
Under these circumstances, some increase in hot metal feedstock cost due to addition of HBI to 
the BF burden can be justified on the basis of increased steel production, higher BF productivity, 
reduced coke consumption, etc. HBI specifications for BF use can be less stringent than for EAF 
steelmaking since higher levels of silica, iron oxides and sulphur and lower metallization can be 
tolerated in the BF.",jms428,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m009uv/clf_cleveland_cliffs_rocket_fuel_cant_melt_these/gq69p7u/,0.063,0.869,0.067,-0.0772
