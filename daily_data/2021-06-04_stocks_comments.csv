0,IMO," I work for a major manufacturer of roofing products in finance.

Glenn Kerman, CEO of Redfin, recently posted that new construction permits *up* 25% in Miami, 56% in Vegas, 96% in Greenville, 122% in Detroit, and 246% in Knoxville

I don’t think you’re correct in saying the demand isn’t there. For my company, the demand is so high that we’re $5 **billion** in backlog. We’ve been completely sold out of product in 2021 since February.

Not only are we producing and putting it right in the flatbed but that ALSO means that the extremely massive distribution centers are completely dry of inventory. Guess what? When consumer demand slows down (presumably in the next 2-3 months) all of these distribution centers need to fill their own inventory of product. Millions of sq ft that needs to be covered with new product.

IMO, this trend continues until 2022.",cheprekaun,26,/r/stocks/comments/nrou4z/with_wood_prices_so_high_curiosity_struck_me_why/h0ib0yk/,0.029,0.971,0.0,-0.3071

7,HUGE," It's not inflation, it's an opportunity. For this example it's lumber, lumber mills have lived on razor thin margins since 2008. Most paper companies got out of the lumber game because of it. Covid has presented a way to throw open margins while blaming it on external factors. Why wouldn't the entire sector follow this? 

I think when the moratorium on evictions lifts you are going to see a complete fallout of the housing and the suppliers for that market. Right now the entire housing market is being driven by low interest rates and low supply.  When people start getting foreclosed on, you're going to see a HUGE spike in supply. I would venture to say it's going to be like 2008/2009 all over again in the housing market.",Neven87,37,/r/stocks/comments/nrou4z/with_wood_prices_so_high_curiosity_struck_me_why/h0i63bj/,0.055,0.862,0.083,0.6037

Meat is generally quite expensive around here. Ground beef will cost you €13/kg or around $7/lb, for example. Beef is especially expensive though, I can get 1kg of chicken filet for €15, better quality ones costing €28.

In fact groceries in general are expensive, my GF and I very rarely buy meat (she is vegetarian and there’s no point cooking a meal just for me), yet we still need at least $480-600/month for groceries in total. 

One thing though is that groceries here are extremely good quality compared to other countries.

I had to walk away in January after the craziness with GME. I made a lot but on paper missed out on some serious gains and it was consuming my waking hours, pre-market, during market, and aftermarket, reading post trying to see what the next play was. 

Following DFV was fun, but glad he ended it when he did. It felt great being part of that history and landing on the right side of it. 

But now, I wrote simple tracker in python, that watches the tickers I'm interested in and emails me any new interesting moves. So it watches it for me and I can peek in when something interesting happens. 

The other thing to keep your sanity is to plan your entry and exit. Figure out a ticker you want and price you are willing to pay and put in a GTC+ext limit order. When that hits, put in a sell GTC+ext limit order at the price you want to sell it at. Then it is automatic. If the price is hit, pre/post or during market you don't miss out. If it doesn't hit after a while cancel and readjust or pick a different meme ticker.

59,DD," Hi, I am a newbie here, but a couple things:

1. I have been reading and it seems that it is normal to have to change your trading approach every few years as the market changes. Specifically how you trade options, penny stocks, etc. Maybe value investing never changes, but if you are chasing high returns rapid, you are trying to capitalize on volatility. These are usually rapid plays, so your system is super important, FOMO only works if you watch a lot, AND if you get in early enough. The real question is why risk your money using a strategy (FOMO) that you aren't trained for- if you want to FOMO, train to be good at that strategy. For example, I am trying to learn how to fomo pumps, I check stock screeners, screen by volume, look for 130-200% Volume for 1-10day versus 365 day trading volume (average), and screen by ""biggest gains"" and ""biggest losers"". Question though, using AM-C as an example, this stock took off, when it hit 25 USD you had to ask, is it over, should i FOMO? If you FOMO'd you'd ride it to 50, then 70 right? The problem is, you are in uncharted territory- how the heck will you decide when to exit???? FOMOing inherently is really hard to ""maximize profits"". If you don't want to miss out on the 20-50% gains, develop a FOMO approach, pick stocks you think will breakout, or better yet read the meme stock lists and develop a strategy for each one. Then you have a system and the impulsiveness goes away...
2. In the case of the G-ME, there has been months of information, DD, and discussion. The message appears to be buy and hold. In that example, you would just buy and walk away, no FOMO needed.",1011010110001010,1,/r/stocks/comments/nrpw0o/the_new_market_is_exhausting/h0jjret/,0.035,0.863,0.102,0.9663

If I continue doing well I will steadily up the ETF % and theta farm % while reducing high-risk YOLO's (I consider almost any naked call a YOLO for the purposes of portfolio).

68,IMO," If it can't last forever, it won't last forever. 

I had the same panic a while back, but then I just realised they are people willing to take on much riskier positions than me. So it's sort of like being angry at someone for winning the lottery - there were longshot odds and they won the bet. There's no guarantee I would have got the same result trying to do the same thing

After the initial surge in Jan, we did see a steady trickle of heavy loss porn from meme-stock winners who got on the bad side of a longshot bet. If people are taking these risky bets, it will probably catch up with them eventually, as is the nature of YOLO bets. 

That said, a lot of conservative investors probably do need to be a bit more ambitious.

Irony?

Look, let’s examine some simple numbers, according to Yahoo finance.

AMC has a float of 448 million shares.
Short interest is 21%, roughly 94 millions shares.
Volume was 580 millions just yesterday, with the stock losing 17%, which suggests there are plenty of sellers.

Even if all shorts were to cover, it probably would’t cause much of a price move compared to what we have already seen. There doesn’t seem to be lack of shares to cover.

116,DD," ""Set alert based off of hypothesis..."" etc

Is the best way I've found. I have a model for how I select investment instruments with a series of rules based off of a combination of how I value things (both in hard numbers like EBIT and in less tangible things like ""can I envision a path that this company's current management would grow it?) and my personal risk tolerance and I stick hard to that unless something truly miraculous is at play. I form a hypothesis based off these and do not sell until they hypothesis is false or I am forced to reevaluate it. I modify my model as I find flaws. So far it's worked well for me - I'm no Buffett but I've managed to stay ahead of the market overall and beating my retirement account's lazy money with my play money makes me a happy boy.

The only time I break away from this is in truly exceptional cases. Reading about Dr. Burry's letters to Gamestop and the subsequent DD made me buy in back in November at $10 and goddamn has it been a ride.

145,GME," I've been fascinated silently watching WSB and GME playout.

It is essentially a mixture of:

1) Strategy creating short squeeze in an ideal situation

2) Herd Mentality

3) Pump and Dump

mixed into one. The strategy is sound, but it requires the use of capital most don't have. So you have to create a herd of willing participants to create large enough capitol to make a squeeze, but you have to encourage people to get in after prices have gone up and it is a clear pump and dump. The people encouraging people to put money in late in the game have an exit strategy to ensure they profit, but late entrants or early entrants who hold until the end take a loss.

Regardless of how much money was made off of the short-sellers getting out, the real advantage was to those that pull the social levers of the herd got in early and quietly knew to start leaving...while still pumping.",cwdawg15,2,/r/stocks/comments/nrpw0o/the_new_market_is_exhausting/h0ilfdm/,0.044,0.774,0.182,0.9756

Yea, so one state (sure large state) had a bill that would just take some of the incentives away from Solar, and the bill was always considered a low chance of being passed, and you think this would impact stocks?

Edit: Cause people like to point out GDP of Cali compared to things like India. First the key point was if the bill was never believed to be passed that would have been factored into the price, given the market is forward looking. So saying that the short interest on these companies was a result of this bill, like OP does, really does not make sense. Second please explain how GDP would be a indictor of roof top solar panel demand? GDP is tied to the companies in the state, for roof top solar panel demand you would look at something like single unit owned homes. Which there are approx 8 million of. Still big number. Ok, those three stocks alone that OP lists (which are no where close to the total suppliers of solar panels) have a market cap of $19B. Solar panels have a average life of 25 to 30 years. Average cost to install is $12,500. If ALL 8 MILLION homes said, lets get solar, that would be $4B in revenue a year. (8 million / 25 years \* $12,500)

Look, all I am trying to say is the current valuations of solar panel companies are looking at future global demand, and in that context Cali is a drop in the bucket.

I would focus on revenue recognition, consolidation principles & preparing cash flow statements - the rest is pretty technical and the kind of stuff even seasoned accountants need to look up

Once you’ve learned the basic principles, the next step is to just read lots of annual reports of different types of companies - the important financial metrics are very industry-specific, so there’s no real substitute to seeing it in action.

211,KO," There is no ceiling on market cap. If business is good, valuation will keep going up. Simple as that. It wasnt that long ago when people thought $1T was insane.

Now if you think business will slow for Google or whoever then thats fine. But QQQ has inherent risk too. By going index, you have to absorb the failures and bad performers along with the winners and also deal with boom + bust cycles.

For instance, if you bought QQQ during the .com, you didnt break even till about 15 years later... a simple stock like KO actually outperformed by a huge margin, during that 15 year period and that assumes you didnt reinvest the divs...

Are you certain we arent in a sort of tech bubble now? Especially with the speculative stuff which has permeated funds like QQQ? Kind of feels like a speculative bubble to me and I dont think its anywhere near corrected.

Many of these new companies, especially eV related, will likely fail and many of the app based copycats and psuedo-tech companies who claim they are tech but really arent, will probably fail too. Further, I have a feeling that all this revenue growth we see in tech is not going to materialize into good margins (like old tech) due to competition. And then you still have some old legacy stuff in QQQ like old energy which I think we all know, will fail in time. etc etc.",thejumpingsheep2,1,/r/stocks/comments/ns2gd8/growth_stock_portfolio_ideas/h0m4w0p/,0.103,0.748,0.149,0.8402

259,ATOS," For ATOS (from Yahoo, credits to RuLaiFu)

This is becoming a game of mind and time by now, however, I’m a Believer/Man of Faith!

All our DD since 12/2020 can not be all wrong;

ATOS managed to have 3 direct offering within 3/4 months, which is unheard of;

ATOS halted a critical P2 of Endoxifen for Breast Cancer about a year earlier, which is also very exceptional;

ATOS asked for extra 325 Mil AS (vs existing 123 Mil) which showed how good they felt about P2 Data of Endoxifen, and this was also kind confirmed by the way Dr. Quay talked about ""having a nice P2 package to talk to big Pharm ..."" in the Presentation at the Investor Summit Conference on 05/18/2021;

All the smart money behind 06/21 and 07/16 calls and the 10 HFs (each invested $5 Mil for off PPS at $2.88 in late 03/2021) are controlled by some very smart and greedy pro in investment, I would not believe that they could be fooled by anyone!

On 05/19, all 6 ATOS employees exercised all their available options at $2.90, Dr Quay - 1.90 Mil SH, Kyle - 0.85 Mil SH, others - 50,000 SH;

The fact that Dr Quay brought back Dr Chen (10% owner of ATOS in 2009) recently as a Dir of ATOS is definitely a good sign too. They might even be married by now. A smart scientist like Dr Quay would never bring someone that important to him into a embarrassment in case P2 of Endoxifen is not good!

Also, since ATOS is not going to present the P2 Data at ASCO this year (06/04 - 06/08, the only reason could be under quiet period for a BO/Partnership), this led me to believe that the probability of a BO/Partnership is 95%+.",AllSeeingEye7,1,/r/stocks/comments/ns106d/rstocks_daily_discussion_fundamentals_friday_jun/h0l875u/,0.047,0.83,0.123,0.9681

And it makes sense when you think about it. If all you do is invest in VTI, you ARE the market so you get the market's 10%.


But if you try to day trade, you are competing against bots and professionals, and they will definitely crush the average retail.

366,ASTS," There are 2 aspects to an equity - first is how it compares to its peers and second is its valuation. If you say Tesla is a good company - is it good at $800 or was it good at $200 pre-split? 

To answer Q1 above : Bark > Chewy when it comes to Customer retention, CAGR and profitability. What that means is if 100 users subscribe to Chewy and Bark, 80 might stay and continue with Bark whereas 70 might stay with Chewy. CAGR being higher than Chewy means it is going to grow faster, profitability higher means it actually earns more per $ of sale than Chewy. Note that CAGR and profitability stack on - so if the rates remain same - due to compounding Bark will have a much significant profitability jump than Chewy in future. Bark also develops its inhouse products - these are listed in upscale store chains in USA - for example: Target and Costco. The consumers here are upper middle class/ upper class Americans - the type who buy brand new Subaru Outbacks - live in suburbia and have money to splurge on dogs. These consumers are definitely the type of crowd you want. Costco - also has a very rigorous selection procedure - you cant buy cheap products in Costco - its usually good quality at good discount. So there is validation that Bark products arent bad. Individual experiences can be hit and miss and one should not invest based on these. (for example I dont do weed but just invested in WeedMaps lol)

On Q2 - Bark just went public through a SPAC. If you know - since March OTC and SPACs have gotten murdered - capital has flown out of these speculative growth stocks. Once trading at $50 some of the big names like STEM got hammered to $16. Just rotation out of growth. BARK is the 2nd major SPAC after SoFi that has de-SPACed and done well, Paysafe and ASTS de-SPACed and tanked. In SPACs - we are seeing companies that actually have revenue and growth being bought after going public and companies like ESG plays with zero revenue getting shorted to $6-7. On valuation - this is a bullish sign for BARK - do your own DD on valuation side. But as a Business - BARK is pretty legit, else big premium retailers like Target and Costco would not be dealing with them.

376,TSLA," I have been buying Tesla puts since January, basically at least once every 3-5 weeks, usually with a 2-3 month expiry. 

I got burned initially and doubled double down for a double burn. Then I made it all back when it fell under $600 for the first time a couple months ago. Then I got burned once more when it went went above $700 again. Then I bought more puts and now I'm currently up (a little over break even on the year currently).

If this sounds fun to you, go for it... if this sounds exhausting and like a crapshoot, then I would agree. 

In my view, it's extremely overvalued, or perhaps overbought is a better term. I say this because I think all the inflation FUD is probably true, and TSLA will be one of the biggest victims of inflation in the short term. If they continue to innovate and execute then I'm bullish over a 7-10 year time span though. Cathie's $3000 in 5 years seems like a bit too short of a time frame to me though.",oarabbus,4,/r/stocks/comments/nrss5h/what_are_you_guys_opinion_on_tesla_puts/h0jh3xf/,0.042,0.849,0.109,0.9015
377,ALL," I read Chinese news media and social media almost everyday. 
I think TSLA’s worse time was in May when literally ALL news and social media in China were attacking it. It all started from a Shanghai car show, then a series of news about accidents and quality issue (brake failure and car lost control). In addition, some privacy and data safety concerns, such as state own organizations cannot use Tesla , and some locations banned Tesla from entering. 
If China is not planning on kicking Tesla out, then there must be another reason for this heavy blow on Tesla. They are giving Tesla some pressures before a deal is made, just like wining a few battles before negotiating a truce, or in Chinese slang “show you some color” (give you a warning).
Then at the end of May, Tesla announced that it will build a data center in China, and all user data will stay in China. 
Now that the goal is achieved, I think they will be easy on Tesla. And Tesla is still considered a luxury foreign car brand by most Chinese people.",MajorJohnUSA,3,/r/stocks/comments/nrss5h/what_are_you_guys_opinion_on_tesla_puts/h0jdqww/,0.113,0.832,0.055,-0.8834

to me, this type of 'debt' news is a calculated tactic by hedge funds to suppress the price for as long as possible. its true range is between $30-$50. highly undervalued in the current market.

500,TA," OP you must understand that there are different strategies to what you refer when saying algo trading. HFTs (high frequency traders) and LLTs (Low Latency Traders), and quantitative traders.

HFTs exploit patters and use financial modelling. They generate a couple of cents each trade, but done a lot of times... e.g. RenTech.

What you often read as quants, it is the modelling part that they refer to. A quant firm is not always a HFT firm. Meaning the volume/speed may not be a factor. But most HFTs use quant strategies.

LLTs use the speed of their network to find and exploit arbitrage opportunities, sometimes even front run orders. Their ally is the speed at which they operate.

While different, in a fair share of instances the same firm can use different strategies for different asset classes in different markets.

Now answering your question, if the hypothesis is confirmed that TA works for some assets, in some markets, they will use it as one of the signals. Most quant shops use different signals.

508,MRK," Thanks for bringing my attention to this.  To me MRK is in an almost perfect position to enter a trade.  Here's why:

1. the forward earnings estimates are roughly 10% avg annual for two years.  Not stellar but solid.
2. It's trading almost 20% below the LT high
3. If you look at a 10yr log chart and draw an average trend and range, it's trading at the absolute bottom of that range.  By that I mean there is an upward trend (I measure it at \~10% CAGR) with a large variation around that trend, and it's at the bottom side of that variation.

If you believe in the long term trend, you get that - 10% - plus potentially the swing from the extreme low point of the variation to the extreme high point of the variation, which adds another 20% to your upside.

I add that I don't follow MRK and I'm not hip to the company news.  But in a way if the news is negative that's in your favor - that's what's depressing the price and giving you an opportunity.  There's no guarantee that they will overcome everything, but as a $200B company with a long history of success, there's a good chance they can right the ship if there's a problem.

This stock is straight decline for a week when all other growth stocks were going up.",lilaznjocky,-1,/r/stocks/comments/nsak5m/twilio_still_down_from_the_end_of_april/h0lsdpz/,0.021,0.848,0.131,0.8441
535,AR," This is when you know a company literally has no idea what to do and how to find other ways to  bring in revenue. I give FB a lot of shit because I don’t like their platform, and I don’t like Zuckerberg, however at least FB is trying to find ways to expand their business in technology like AR. I still hate FB and would never buy it but I do not see any reason why anybody would own TWTR over FB.",JRshoe1997,2,/r/stocks/comments/nsaaku/twitter_launches_first_subscription_service_is_it/h0ltt5j/,0.077,0.838,0.085,-0.09

538,UPC," I don't know about their management.  I helped them with a bar code printer in 1993 that had fewer read errors, but they still didn't buy it. At the time, when a Walmart cashier had to manually enter a UPC code if it didn't scan, they charged $25 each time.  That ate into the profit for probably fifty items.  It was stupid of them to not buy it.",Kooky_Ingenuity,1,/r/stocks/comments/ns4t6s/thoughts_on_hbi_hanes_brands/h0l7gn1/,0.089,0.831,0.081,-0.1436

540,AAPL," You need to have a thesis if you're trading stocks. Either buy these stocks for the long term hold and stop micromanaging your portfolio, or set a plan like ""I'm buying AAPL at X because I think it'll go to Y at which I'll sell, otherwise I'll cut my losses at Z"". With your current mindset you're better off just buying and holding index funds.",midnightmacaroni,7,/r/stocks/comments/nsailq/made_the_first_largest_mistake_of_trading_so_far/h0l9ud2/,0.104,0.816,0.08,-0.1531

543,SMED," I’m not sure. I’ll ask her. I just wanted to let you know the situation from a worker’s perspective and not the fear mongering news corporations. 

On the topic of SMED, their earnings will probably still be up due to all the vaccination needles having to be disposed of. 

Once that stops though, I can see it dropping down to prepandemic levels fairly quickly. Just my opinion.",BenevolentMachine,1,/r/stocks/comments/nrvbmv/hospitals_are_still_full_people_are_still_worried/h0m3ut1/,0.053,0.885,0.062,0.1675
544,AMC," Yes I believe it will continue to attract retail and squeeze the shorts given it has the highest % of float of any stock, it's a speculative trade no doubt but there is room for that in an average portfolio.

I've sold out go GME and AMC long ago and made good profits and have now shifted to $WKHS, $BB, and $CLOV. I'm confident I will get a 150-300% return given the short % and the retail attention on all three.  

It's the number one shorted stock lol, it's like if anything is going to short squeeze this is it now that AMC has faded and GME is a bit too pricey. 

Plus the downside with AMC and GME is just too great, both can get cut in half and then in half again and still be over valued lol.",shad0wtig3r,3,/r/stocks/comments/nrok6g/workhorse_next_short_squeeze/h0ipg0d/,0.052,0.714,0.234,0.9847

546,WKHS," WKHS surged for sole reason that it has high short interest, which it has bc it's a crap company that lost the USPS contract (i.e. its biggest potential revenue stream).

This isn't investing...it's gambling that you can get in, make some bux, and get out before it comes crashing back down.",realjones888,3,/r/stocks/comments/nrok6g/workhorse_next_short_squeeze/h0it9sd/,0.089,0.856,0.055,-0.2263
