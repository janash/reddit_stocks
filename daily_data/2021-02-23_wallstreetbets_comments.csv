54,RH," There have constantly been fears of a coming crash due to inflation and over-valuation of companies (extrinsic value is a thing, but over the pandemic its become more and more what people are pushing rather than intrinsic value).

When those fears escalate and people realize their extreme valuations of companies, the stock market will correct (or burst, but I doubt this is the bubble bursting). It is important to note that almost everything is doing worse than what even the most negative statistical models claimed, especially the tech industry. 

Hence, last week I started rolling credit spreads on SPY. The panic is insane. Today I opened 3 call credit spread, premium width of $24 on a $1 spread expiring tomorrow with a 90% chance (based on basic models) of profit. There is almost no way there will be a recovery of that size by tomorrow. Only reason I'm not doing naked calls is because RH doesn't let me, and other brokers don't let me do spreads yet.",13steinj,60,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lqjxhp/walking_into_the_stock_market_today/gogu4p7/,0.161,0.75,0.089,-0.9398

*Please note this is not investment invest

Long Dick Style is a method of intercourse where the rhythm is slow but deep and thorough. It is most effective with a long penis (preferably 8 inches or more). The penis is inserted into the vagina all the way in using a slow, smooth stroke. You pull out slowly as well right until the head of the penis is about to fall out and then you sink back in slow. Rinse, repeat. This allows the female to feel every inch of your long dick. It also increases effectiveness by rotating your hips and doing a ""stir the coffee"" motion with your stroke. Long dicking is only possible when the man is in a dominant position where he can control the stroke: missionary, doggie, or lazybone (sideways). Playing R&B and matching your stroke to the bass line of the song also increases effectiveness. Be aware of the side effects though. While long dicking a woman can greatly increase your chances of getting breakfast in the morning, it can also take your relationship to a whole other level that you may not want to take it.

Short Dick style is a method of intercourse where the pace is quite fast and usually most effective with a short shlong. 
The member is placed inside of the funbags with lightning speed. Rapidly slam your meat into her like a jackrabbit and when your appendage slides out, let it, because this lets her realise that your penis is so fucking small that it slipped out when you weren't even that deep. Short Dick Style is only possible in position where you are in control: Doggie, Missionary, Erotic V, Head game, The butter churner, and more. Playing upbeat music and syncing your violent thrusts to the bass can improve effectiveness. Be careful for side affects, as she may never have sex with you again and possibly dump you.",Mammoth-Stranger6128,238,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lq0fkd/round_two_we_out_hurr/goebvo2/,0.102,0.816,0.082,-0.6386

Lyrics :
 
Oh I bid farewell to my monthly paycheck
 
And I gambled it all on a GME bet
 
To hold with the boys and ignore calls to sell
 
 Until we have given the Hedgies all hell
 
 
And the tendies and diamonds are filling my mind
 
I'll search for the moon and pay losses no mind
 
I fear not the Hedgie I fear not his greed 
 
 
I remember the HODLers, will they think of me?
 
When we make all our millions to spite the Hedgie.
 
 
Plot a course off to Mars from the orbit of Moon
 
To a place where my gains grew along with my crew
 
It's not about greed, no I tell to my best
 
But sending a message to Wallstreet the pest
 
 
As the words of their dread fill the space of my ears
 
They're crying like children, their saltiest tears  
 
My heart fills with joy then, it’s bigger than we
 
I remember the HODLers, will they think of me?
 
When we make all our millions to spite the Hedgie.
 
 
 
 
Oh for sure they will learn that there is consequence
 
For playing with markets for his needs and ends
 
But when Reddit investors used their tricks on them
 
They screamed and they shouted while we bought again
 
 
As the sights of their rage fill the space in my eyes
 
For they duped us, but they won’t escape us this time
 
We're this far from winning, this far from their greed
 
I remember the HODLers, will they think of me?
 
When we make all our millions to spite the Hedgie.
 
 
Now that I'm staring down on the Feds and the Rich
 
I'm not sure what I want but I don't think it's this
 
As my Brothers stand in the raging typhoon
 
I hold onto my shares as they launch towards the moon
 
 
As the souls of HODLers live for'er in my mind  
 
As I fulfill the dreams that they once tried to find
 
I'll look from the moon with the stars within reach
 
 
I remember WallStreetBets and they think of me
 
For our stocks with the moonshot forever will be.
 
 
I remember the fallen and they think of me

124,OC," Reddit is so fucked. I mean, I still like the site, especially some smaller communities, but between the shitshow that is the frontpage and /r/PoliticalHumor-like subs cropping up in my feed despite having filtered the former, there is a special amount of dumb in how we incentivize original creations.

And don't get me started on v.reddit and how keeping people on the platform (which is already easy as pie because social media aggregators are modern cyber crack) is reddit's preferred mode of operation. The amount of original content stolen straight out of YT videos that are causing the creators to miss out on revenue and often credit (which is barely worth a thing in some threads that get 60k upvotes in a minute but no comments whatsoever) is nuts, the official reddit app, which entirely too many people use, is awful at embedding video players like YT's, something reddit apps solved a decade ago, you can't post your OC and even link to your content yourself... how is that a good approach to any of this? How do you not see people like Gallowboob hardcore exploiting the system for significant personal gains and design your platform around the bullshit?

It's so easy too! Banslap the shit out of people ripping off video. If you can't source it, don't post it. Or post it in TOMT-like subs for content before posting it to the actual subreddits. There are so many policies you could implement that would make all of this as fun as it was when everyone just spammed rage comics or some nonsense. Or, you know, lead to actual enjoyment.

Shame people hard for not going through the process. I get that it is a matter of scaling as well, you can't expect this to work perfectly when people submit so much all the time, but there has to be some engineering that can be done to at least minimize the damage the re-host cat-and-mouse game does to people who supply us with the good-good

It's also kind of absurd how WSB of all subs is so consistent about meme quality. OC left and right, not just phoning it in but people really going balls out, and you're telling me someone topping 99% of submissions in here doesn't even get to post his own link in the comments?

293,DD," It is dawning on me how deep this breakdown in communication may be affecting the tides of these markets.... Like, on the reals tho.  


We got very wealthy and very powerful people with big influence from decades of experience in Economics and studying markets that really have no clue how the Internet communicates to them and what appropriate reactions to the Internet communicating with you should be.   


I think I'm having this DD epiphany moment, retards... If the old money was as familiar with the Internet as the average retail investor is, maybe none of this would have happened...Their fee fee's haven't been finely crushed into the powdered sugar texture of nonexistence like all of ours have growing up beside the Internet. The more I see old money communicating and market reactions of the money controlled by the old money, the more I think that we gotta fix this breakdown in communication.....Like, ambassadors or some shit that can translate 9 million handcrafted wares of memelords trying to make money.   


Yeah, it's Elon Musk but damn...... It's fucking Twitter. Twitter is on the Internet, and this is what people do on the Internet: They troll each other. It's what we do inside this series of tubes. We break each other down until we see the sweet embrace of vulnerability, and that takes years of experience to handle the same way I believe it takes years of experience to acquire/maintain vast levels of wealth without letting it destroy you.  


At this point, I just want to see some kind of progress from all this... On all fronts. I see people struggling around me in society, and if the fix is something as simple as establishing communication to a generation that doesn't speak this language, then I think this is something that should be seriously considered for everyone's sake.",someonerezcody,28,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lqidhh/so_he_really_told_me_to_stick_it_up_my_ass/gognjqg/,0.038,0.864,0.098,0.949

306,GDP," I think you are underestimating gold's long term performance it's not beat the stock market but its held its own quite well in the last 3 decades. 

Mainly though, his point is that the drivers that caused the global monetarily collapse haven't actually been fixed at all so he can't change his outlook, sure he can't predict when exactly all his predictions will come true but alot of the pieces are falling in place. The USA's slice of global GDP is falling every decade all the while the national debt is rising faster than ever with ever growing trade deficits, so the things that we used to get away with will eventually stop working. Once they stop working, all the dollars we've sent off seas will come back to the USA and finish hollowing out our assets. You can call it a smplistic argument but it makes a lot of sense to me.

387,AMC," No they don't - AMC is not a content creator. There's absolutely no point in having a streaming service. Movies are owned by their creators / investors (most often the bigger studios) and they, like Disney, have their own streaming services or distribution channels for their productions. Movie theatres make their money, mostly, off of the supplemental goods like expensive as hell popcorn, soda, the seat price, etc. and not the actual movie itself via the ticket price which the majority goes to the movie studio; so in this case having a streaming service for them would be like owning the movie theatre but without any of the supplemental item sales to make a profit on the cost of the content they're showing.

Edit: So they have an On Demand service...here's the new Wonder Woman, for example: https://www.amctheatres.com/movies/wonder-woman-1984-54422 - The problem is it is $19.99 to stream the movie one time. This goes with what I said above - they don't have their own content or anything else to make a profit from so they have to charge a stupidly large rental fee to get some kind of a profit out of this service.",Upgrades_,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lpysg9/amc_is_looking_good_new_york_city_movie_theaters/gofn390/,0.076,0.841,0.083,0.3299

Most retail investors DO NOT participate. But we all look at the movement of the stock.

It seems to be that how shorts and longs can manipulate the price pre and after market with lower volumes is a very powerful tool to control the psychological sentiment!

A company releases earnings. A short DUMPS a bunch of stock. People see Shares -10% and what do us apes do? Omg it’s falling. Sell!

470,SAN," Guam guy is MICHAEL FRANKLIN QUITUGUA SAN NICOLAS. He is a man of the people. Here is a story about him you might enjoy:

After the 2014 general election, acting Governor Ray Tenorio introduced a bill to increase salaries of elected and appointed officials retroactively. The bill was passed by the legislature in San Nicolas' absence. In December, San Nicolas introduced a bill to repeal the raises, which failed passage. Starting later that month, San Nicolas began to donate the pay increase to local charities.

San Nicolas introduced a bill in 2015 to repeal the elected and appointed officials' pay raises, among other related matters. The bill was enacted, but the provision repealing the pay raises was removed before passage. San Nicolas revisited repealing the pay raises for elected and appointed officials by introducing a new bill later in the year, but it failed passage in November. The Guam Legislature reconsidered and passed the new bill in January 2016. Governor Calvo vetoed the new bill. An attempted override of the new bill failed.

Senator San Nicolas introduced a bill in 2017, which would reduce the salaries of elected and appointed officials that had been raised by Public Law 32-208. A similar measure, which affected only the salaries of the Attorney General, the Public Auditor, the Governor, the Lieutenant Governor, and members of the Guam Legislature was introduced days prior was passed by the legislature in March, vetoed by Governor Calvo, then was overridden by the legislature in May.",Dependent-Beneficial,14,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lq1gks/nyse_gme_correction_of_60230_shares_on_the_buy/gofvv59/,0.073,0.893,0.034,-0.875

472,GME," A market maker is supposed to smooth supply and demand. So, if nobody in the market is selling, they sell some of their shares (even if they don't own them (!)) and they hope to buy those shares back within a very short period of time. 

This scheme breaks down if nobody is selling. I don't think 60,000 shares is a lot, however. Let's say everyone currently holding GME ""likes the stock"" and would simply refuse to sell at any price and also stops lending their shares, the only outcome is a financial catastrophe, especially if the board of the company is also in on it. 

Even in the case of GME people sold (too bad we don't know how many), which is what the economic models would also predict.

512,VERY," It appears to me that one cannot exist without the other, they are both feeding each other constantly.

Man, there are so many things to talk about here, which are all pretty much just my opinion and my own perspective, i'll try to keep it somewhat short...

I believe one of the biggest influences over the past 2 decades is Facebook, followed by other huge platforms such as Twitter, Instagram, Tik Tok.

Ever since Facebook arrived and people all around the world can watch the lives of people all around the world, we love being judged and love looking as good as possible, image has become ever increasingly popular. This, when combined with dating, sex appeal and love have a massive influence as pretty much most storytelling includes a romance of some kind, currently the world is obsessed with dating, sex, love, weddings, casual relationships, failed relationships, rejecting people, being rejected by people, impressing someone you think is hot.

These are VERY important aspects of todays movies and if you manage to find a film which doesn't have some kind of sexual/romantic sub-plot going on, then you've found an incredibly rare film.

These days generally speaking, people doing impressive things with as little effort as possible, and acting like it's no big deal is cool, even more so when they are physically and mentally attractive.

I believe big action flicks, especially mainstream stuff, tend to share a lot in common with the dating world, especially if you compare dating in that era with relationships in films of that era. Look how these days how much emphasis is put on how unappealing it is to have a clingy partner, to value your personal independence, and bail at the first sign of any small insignificance, where love becomes rarer and temporary affection becomes increasingly desired.

You know what they say, sex sells...",KomitoDnB,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lq7mqk/i_like_the_stock_and_id_appreciate_it_if_youd/goh8xry/,0.037,0.755,0.208,0.9959

-Rothschilds bow to Bogdanoffs 

-In contact with aliens 

-Possess psychic-like abilities 

-Control france with an iron but fair fist 

-Own castles & banks globally 

-Direct descendants of the ancient royal blood line 

-Will bankroll the first cities on Mars (Bogdangrad will be be the first city)

 -Own 99% of DNA editing research facilities on Earth 

-First designer babies will in all likelihood be Bogdanoff babies 

-both brothers said to have 215+ IQ, such intelligence on Earth has only existed deep in Tibetan monasteries & Area 51 

-Ancient Indian scriptures tell of two angels who will descend upon Earth and will bring an era of enlightenment and unprecedented technological progress with them 

-They own Nanobot R&D labs around the world 

-You likely have Bogdabots inside you right now 

-The Bogdanoffs are in regular communication with the Archangels Michael and Gabriel, forwarding the word of God to the Orthodox Church. Who do you think set up the meeting between the pope & the Orthodox high command (First meeting between the two organisations in over 1000 years) and arranged the Orthodox leader's first trip to Antarctica in history literally a few days later to the Bogdanoff bunker in Wilkes land? 

-They learned fluent French in under a week 

-Nation states entrust their gold reserves with the twins. There's no gold in Ft. Knox, only Ft. Bogdanoff 

-The twins are about 7 decades old, from the space-time reference point of the base human currently accepted by our society 

-In reality, they are timeless beings existing in all points of time and space from the big bang to the end of the universe. We don't know their ultimate plans yet. We hope they're benevolent beings.﻿",activialobster,14,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lqkddw/boomers_when_millennials_are_winning_in_the_market/gohnn97/,0.009,0.901,0.089,0.9741

IG is a spread betting platform. That means that the decimal on stocks are shifted 2 places to the right, priced in cents for the clever among you. You bet X per point that a stock is going to go up or down, their options aren't true options. If you're wondering why we use such a piece of shit platform run by a bunch of scumbag criminals it's because it's classed as betting, therefore gambling which, in the UK, makes your gains tax free as well as being commission free. 

This fucking cock snogger should have known it was a 6 dollar strike because Tesla's share price is represented on IG as 71056.00 so obviously a 600 strike is waaaaay OTM. 

IG however is a shit show and not all stocks are shifted like that, TUI for example has the decimal in the right place as do indexes. 

Further, IG are cunts and will do nothing to help out because you misunderstood their platform, these are the cunts that emailed some of their clients last week to say they'll be raising margin to 100% on 1000+ stocks and then didn't email the rest of their clients until yesterday. 

They're also the same cunts that restricted trading on GME, BB, AMC etc because their platform is shit and kept crashing when NY opened. 

Basically, if you're not sure, cross check it against another platform and use a bit of brain power.

841,TSLA," Something has got to be wrong. I just took a look at TSLA Jan 21 2022 PUTS with a strike price of $600 and also the ones with a strike price of $6.

Both sets have ask and bid prices and open interest. What is not clear, is what exactly did you buy and why your broker is showing a price of zero on the bid?

I took a look at your image, and it does look like you bought the $6 puts, NOT the $600. What I still do not understand, is why your broker is showing a price of zero on the bid? There should be SOMETHING due to the time premium, even so far out of the money.

You may want to call and talk with them; it is possible that the problem is their trading desk is not quoting the bid properly for that. I, myself, had the experience years ago where I went to sell the ADRs of a Canadian company on NASDAQ. I put in an order to sell at the bid, and it just sat there all day, with no volume and my order not getting executed. The next day I sent a message asking 'is there something wrong' and why my order would not execute. The order executed within an hour with no explanation as to what was wrong.

You might think this wont affect you much but the stock market moves up and down with what the whales do and your stock value will go down all the same whether or not you get taxed.

1332,ACH," Right now when you buy or sell a stock you don’t actually have the stock/money yet. You can see this with Robinhood and everyone leaving the platform complaining they have to wait x number of days.

So you sell off your stocks, T-2 means it takes 2 days for those stocks to “settle”. So you’ve sold them, someone bought them, but neither of you have either of them, they’re being held and validated by (I believe) the clearing house. The buyers brokerage fronts the money to purchase it, the transaction clears after 2 days, then the stock is released and the funds are transferred.

It’s supposed to catch discrepancies and wrong trades like being able to reverse a bank transaction that was committed fraudulently or from a glitch. It also used to be much longer than 2 days.

Moving to instant means your brokerage no longer has to front any money during the transaction and you can just buy directly from the seller and it validates during the transaction within a few seconds/minutes. So it means small brokerages don’t run out of cash or leverage to give to clients if trade volume skyrockets (Gee Em Eee). It also means though that if the system does run into issues with irregularities or glitches that it would be very difficult or impossible to stop or revert inaccurate trades, like if you wire transfer money to someone, you can’t get it back without outside intervention like legally forcing them to in cases of fraud, but a bank transfer you can just contact your bank and cancel it within a few days because an ACH transfer takes 3 days to clear.",AuroraFinem,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lq2jj9/after_the_gamestop_fiasco_momentum_builds_for_an/gogpbj7/,0.076,0.838,0.086,-0.0231

1384,AMC," lol, google amc share dilution, stock is not going anywhere in the mid to long term.

edit: 

from seekingalpha.com

Considering that in January the company’s attendance is expected to be down 91% Y/Y, it’s going to be unsustainable for AMC to pay a 15% to 17% in interest rates in the long-term in the current environment. That’s why it’s very likely that the company will once again dilute its shareholders and leverage its balance sheet even more in the not so distant future in order to survive longer. For that reason, it’s safe to assume that AMC’s stock is uninvestable for the long-term, and that’s why we continue to short the company. With a price target of only $2.44 per share, AMC’s stock is significantly overvalued at the current price, and with a short interest of only ~16%, it’s not going to become the next GameStop (GME).",robotic_trouser_worm,-6,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lq0rer/fellow_amc_apes_why_you_should_not_sell_amc_yet/goe4wou/,0.009,0.887,0.104,0.9287

Palantir is consistently upselling its customers. Once they see the benefit of it they want more.

Also, even with the current tech sell off this company will prove that it’s recession/chaos proof. Their software should absolutely shine at the first sign of a recession.

FANG went through the moon. So yeah, earnings growth is more important then just rising rates because the economy is accelerating. 2. Real interest rates are still close to Zero. That has been the case for the past 10 years. There is no inflation pressure. Look at the 2 trillion stimulus that had gone through since March last year, where is the inflation.

1497,SO," He bought options while Tesla was crashing.

His ""bet"" has an expiration date.

While his ""bet"" was sitting it can lose/value just like any other bet (options gain ""extrinsic"" value which is kind of the value the market places on that bet outside of the actual value of the stock, which is ""intrinsic"" value) and you can sell your bet (option), just like a share or stereo.

Instead of waiting for the ""bet"" (option) to continue to see if it gets intrinsic value (i,e. the price of the stock goes above the strike on a call), he sold his bet based on its extrinsic value (whatever the market thinks his bet is worth).

Since his bet gained value (due to rising IV  on calls) before it even hit ITM; he sold it for a profit.

SO someone paid him to ""buy"" his bet at a price lower then that person would have been able to make on their own (since IV was spiking)..and he profits without even knowing if his option will eventually print (that is the buyer's problem now).",NotThatSpecialToo,14,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lqkp8o/70k_dumped_into_226_tsla_calls_this_morning/gohsegk/,0.032,0.801,0.167,0.975

1500,TSLA," Well its both. Attributing the rise purely to IV rising was a mistake, admittedly.

When the underlying stock price is rising then the value of those options go up.  That is the primary driver of his option value in this case(you are correct).

However. those wild swings (both up and down) do increase IV, especially when those changes (up or down) lead to people hedging and/or speculating on more options to protect existing positions (or cash in on the movement). 

IV will increase if more people buy options (which would happen with an active stock like TSLA in any direction but probably not a low volume stock)",NotThatSpecialToo,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lqkp8o/70k_dumped_into_226_tsla_calls_this_morning/gohwx4w/,0.015,0.843,0.142,0.852

1507,GME," There’s a great reason, actually. 

Before the GameStop fiasco, the sub was about being completely and recklessly careless with your money, in the hopes of chasing a 1 in a 1000 that you hit it big. The sub had good posts about OPTIONS trading and OPTIONS trading only. The moral fundamentals of a company were not part of the discussion. It was about making MONEY to pay off student loans, a mortgage or a longer runway on high class hookers.

The GameStop fiasco brought in all the pseudo left wing social warriors who thought that somehow investing long in a stock and losing all of your life savings somehow ‘stuck it to the man.’

I don’t care about retail investors over hauling the system. I care about ME making money. 

And now it’s these idiots (calling them retards would be a compliment) think they’re going to reverse the market thru the $1,800 cash positions in their Robinhood accounts? Give me a fucking BREAK.

1559,GME," BTW, I think you might also be mixing up naked shorting and covering shorts.

covering short = closing your short position. So ""forcing someone to cover their short"" would be the bear equivalent of ""forcing someone to sell their shares"". The only entity that would force someone to cover their short (or force you to sell your shares) is the broker, e.g. if you've bought your shares on margin, can't pay the short interest (or credibly prove you will be able to) etc etc. During the short squeeze on GME, people were forced to cover their shorts because the short interest rose so much that the brokers got cold feet and basically said ""we can't let you go this deep into debt, you have to cash out at a loss now"".

naked shorting is different (and somewhat illegal) but there's a huge amount of flexibility in the rules. MMs for instance are allowed to do naked shorting for set periods of time, and some brokers are allowed to sell you a short ""naked"" without it counting as such, as long as they eventually locate a share, roll the short over someone elses account/etc. If the broker fails to do this correctly, they end up on the fails-to-deliver list from the SEC, but even that doesn't mean they necessarily get punished right away, think of it more like going into debt. The SEC doesn't care all that much about this (this used to actually be fully legal until 2008) 

There's been a lot of conspiracy theories floating around recently as to whether anything illegal has happened with GME and whether the SEC will take action or not, and likewise there are schools of thoughts that believe that naked shorting (for brief periods of time) is necessary for market liquidity. I have no opinion or insights on either of these, but I don't see a reason either way why this would help GME to go through another short squeeze.

If you feel like it, give [this document from the SEC](https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-50103.htm#V) a read. It's a bit dense, but basically more or less says ""you don't have to locate a share before shorting as long as you reasonably and in good faith believe you will be able to locate the share within the given time-limit. Having a stock categorized as 'easy to borrow' is sufficient justification to believe you will be able to locate the share"".",jringstad,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lqfkoo/premarket_today_is_the_bubble_burst_imminent/gogn8lq/,0.073,0.823,0.104,0.8916

Lmfao. It's exercised, not ""activated"".

Also, since most of the AMC contracts have deltas of 1, they're already fully hedged, so they're not getting squeezed. Even the contract with a delta of 0.71 implies that 71 shares have been bought for the market maker to hedge, so the squeeze would be the additional 29 shares for every open contract, only on that specific strike, assuming they don't close the contracts before then.

It doesn't take a genius to know that if you shorted at $200-$500 you are in the green so much right now you'd call a doctor if your shit was that green. 78% SI is new shorts coming in. If you were an actual investor you'd know that but you don't you're in denial. On top of that Even tho I don't like polkin he was 100% right the shortsqueeze was tiny but big enough to trigger a gamma squeeze and then social media being so big now for the first time spread the word so hard and fast it triggered a double and triple gamma squeeze which is impossible now due to the options chains existing already.,rasijaniaz,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lqow0n/schwab_and_td_ameritrade_now_have_a_300_margin/goidk4z/,0.044,0.906,0.05,-0.2178

He could also be saying I'm buying these contracts now and if there's significantly volatility this week I can sell them at profit before they expire. The closer the stock gets to 50 the more valuable it is, everything over 50 (+ cost) is money in the bank.

DFV invested in the company, not the squeeze.

1961,AMC," I said it yesterday, and I'll say it again.  I think this week will increase to $10-11.00, and then have a lull down to $6ish.  It's hard to predict the coming weeks from that point, but longterm, I 100% agree with you.

Movies are one of the last, few ""entertainment"" events we can do in our communities that mainstream across the US (and the globe).  Sure, there are fun/entertainment places like barcades and such, but everyone enjoys going to the movies.  I think we all want to return to normal and, once we do, seeing movies is an easy, accessible form of ""normalcy"".

I got into AMC at $5.50.  Holding until that $10-11.00 point (depending on the upward velocity at that point), and I'll cash out about half of that so my remaining shares I hold will be ""free"".  Then, I'll be watching the metrics like a hawk to dip back in toward the low that I think might come in the next week or so, again, possible in the $6.00 range.

1970,AMC," Please explain why AMC would deserve a different valuation multiple than at past ATH’s. Tech and EV’s are given higher acceptable multiples due to the incredible growth opportunities seen in those markets, but where do you see that growth for AMC?

Personally I think they’ll survive, but the momentum here was driven purely off the short interest, not off belief that AMC was somehow going to expand and grow as a business.",spongesquare,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lqo8t8/amc_recovery_play/gohsp6f/,0.0,0.782,0.218,0.9354

1976,AMC," >	the biggest no brainer

It is certainly something not a lot of thought went into. 

It started as a “squeeze” for people who were late to GME, and now, its a play on a dying company in a dying sector being popular after covid (which will not just suddenly end, it’ll taper off over the entire year at the earliest) when people have already spent all this time indoors.. 

The fundementals don’t support any of these noobie speculations. They diluted the float to gross levels. Killing any chance of a squeeze and making every share even less valuable. They paid off a PORTION of their debt, but they are very much still underwater. 

“people will want to see movies” is the worst dd in wsb history. But sure, its a guaranteed no brainer.

I would like to see just one AMC comment not from a brand new account shilling this stuff.

The actual no brainer was stuff like airline stocks and fuel, but those got pumped up as far back as May. Early bird gets the worm and all that.",Disguised,0,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lq6rb9/hold_apes_we_will_conquer_kings_do_king_sht_amc/gofjcwf/,0.1,0.782,0.119,-0.0763
