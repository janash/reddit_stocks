10,BEST," Yes. With $5+ billion in revenue in 2021 alone, $BEST inc is $21+ a share with a 1xP/S

I think BEST inc is easily one of the most undervalued stocks around. A share price around $1.10+; a current P/S of 0.109; and yet raking in billions annually consistently, and growing revenue too.

Crazily undervalued.",the_mirror_viewer01,-2,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/oqj4te/simplywallst_updates_best_incs_nysebest_valuation/h6cfmb6/,0.073,0.665,0.262,0.8918
11,BEST," This is misleading. Revenue is $991 million US. $6 billion RMB. 

Adjusted EBITDA losses increased. Cost of revenue was over $1 trillion US. 

It does seem that the company is getting costs down and improving margins. EPS is still negative, but rising. 

An implied value based on historical ratios (P/E, P/S, P/B, Price/Operating Income) over the last 3 years places fair value closer to $1.60 per share. Still a discount to the current market. 

P/S doesn't take into account if the company is profitable or not, which BEST is not.",Itsboomhomie,2,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/oqj4te/simplywallst_updates_best_incs_nysebest_valuation/h6dstqf/,0.106,0.715,0.179,0.7804
