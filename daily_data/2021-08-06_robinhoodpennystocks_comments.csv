0,HUT, Thank you sir for what youâ€™re doing. I picked up some HUT calls and made gains off of those.,blinddog81,12,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/oyvdxq/penny_stock_unusual_option_activity_85/h7vru0e/,0.0,0.766,0.234,0.5994

5,ETON," ETON is criminally under the radar. I've been accumulating for a few years as it swings up and down. 

PDUFA date aside, ETON already has enough approved drugs in place to be profitable. My current expectation is they are consistently profitable starting in Q4/Q1 - even if they never get another drug approved. 

Beyond that, they are an extremely solid company and a great acquisition target in a few years. The guaranteed revenue and high number of approved drugs will only get more interesting to larger firms as time goes on. Plus they've got tons of cash to weather any additional COVID bumps. 

And did I mention the big players have been slowly accumulating for the last 18 months? You'll see very low volume and then suddenly it spikes for a week. Then nothing for awhile and boom, another volume spike - all without meaningfully increasing the price. That's institutions buying. 

This is my favorite biopharmaceutical and I'm just continuing to add, add, add.",alcon835,2,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/oyu4oz/eton_under_the_radar/h7xckgt/,0.014,0.83,0.156,0.9722

8,IT, SOMEONE HACKED MY ROBINHOOD ACCOUNT. SOLD ALL MY SHARES AND TRANSFERRED IT TO THEIR BANK ACCOUNT. Robinhood security is a joke and their customer service is a joke. About 10000 was stolen from me. They told me they would stop the transfer woke up this morning to notify me that it actually went through and still no message or email back from Robinhood. No security notification about someone adding a bank account to my profile. You would think Robinhood would have some sort of security for this type of thing.,krisconry11,2,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/oz28nr/daily_discussion_thread/h7xugez/,0.128,0.732,0.14,0.0772
