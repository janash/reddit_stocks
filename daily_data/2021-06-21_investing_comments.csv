0,TV," It’s weird to me that bond yields dropped so hard when stocks haven’t moved downward that much.

The pundits on TV are saying the drops in yield are due to the market scoffing at the fed’s slightly more hawkish speeches.

1,GME," First of all I'm an idiot. But in my idiotic opinion the inflation we have seen up until now is real and somewhat permanent, these will be the new prices of goods (wages should follow). Except the goods that got really out of hand (like lumber) will come down somewhat. There is no reason why we should extrapolate the rate of inflation into the future indefinitely, it just isn't realistic. Sure, covid was a briefly deflationary then inflationary event, but there's no reason why there will be rampant inflation after this, I just haven't seen a convincing reason why yet. There's too many deflationary factors at play coming out of this. The world was already about to change drastically this decade. That process has just become vastly accelerated. 

The (hyper)inflation narrative is just too damn pervasive and it's being pushed hard rn by the media. On top of this valuations are quite stretched. Overall, a decent amount of the population saved up several thousand dollars during the pandemic, and that money will be spent out of the gates this summer. But after that well runs dry? The economy will weaken and so will markets once the bumpers come down on the bowling lane. That would be deflationary.

3,IMO," Last Thursday, the Fed met and discussed future policy. Previous to this meeting, there was no discussion of raising rates and the popular narrative was that the fed was making a mistake and that inflation would spiral out of control. Post-meeting, the dot plot and Fed minutes indicate that the fed has moved forward their plans to raise rates and taper QE. This gives the market confidence that the Fed is seeing continued positive economic data and also that inflation will be kept under control. The two stories driving the rate market now are people who are selling because the Fed indicated they’ll raise rates sooner and those who are buying because they have so much cash. IMO there is no flight to safety, because if anything people would be buying treasuries, not selling. I’d think that as inflation fears ebb and the Fed starts to taper you’ll see a continual gradual increase in rates to a normal range of 2-3% for the 10 yr. Also continue to believe out-of-favor growth equities are attractive and will rebound as the cyclical, reflation, re-opening trades lose favor after the economic reopening is behind us.",trappedMusician,1,/r/investing/comments/o4ncwr/we_need_to_talk_about_the_bond_market/h2jqage/,0.058,0.825,0.117,0.9118

5,GDP," > What is ""secular"" growth?

Basically, permanent/meaningful/non-transitory growth:

>Broadly speaking, growth falls into two categories – cyclical and secular. Cyclical growth can be thought of as passive, whereas secular growth is driven by a structural change in a sector, industry or company.

>...

>Secular growth occurs when something fundamentally changes within a sector or industry, creating a wave of new demand. Secular growth rates can be materially higher than cyclical growth rates, as secular growth depends on changes in customer behavior rather than changes to GDP.


>One of the great secular growth stories of the 21st century has been the rise in e-commerce. Online sales have been taking progressively more market share from traditional retailers for the past 20 years, a secular trend that has literally transformed how people shop.

24,USB," Typically the founders will hold the majority of shares with a minority of shares floated publicly. So it is unlikely that you will be able to get a majority control of the company. 

However there I likely a clause which gives minority shareholders non-executive director positions on the board. An obvious example is Lance Stroll as non executive director of Aston Martin despite holding only 5% of shares. 

If you are hell bent on acquiring a company, you can simply buy up companies from people willing to sell. They don't have to be failing either, some maybe be professional entrepreneurs, who build companies up to a $10 mil valuation before selling and starting a new company. Some may be getting to old and the kids don't want to inherit the business so are selling up to enjoy retirement.  Some might want to sell because they just want to retire and enjoy life after building a profitable company.

47,MSFT," MSFT - My Friday sentiment (and weekend) was that it'd trade slightly down. Which I should clarify to mean close slightly down from last trading day.

Someone mentioned it's in a cup and handle pattern and I agreed with them and called that it wouldn't break 260 and that should be the profit taking taret.

It actually hit 262. which is good for bulls, but it hasn't changed the apparent sentiment, so while it's behaving in a kind of cup and handle pattern, I think as long as this sentiment remains that will squeeze into a trading range.

260 - 262 may sound like quite a spread but it's basically its nearterm resistance for now. It's knocking on the roof and has potential for good buys throughout the week around 258.

\---------------------------------------------

I don't intend for these calls to be ""day trading"" either. Lots of people maybe get that impression.  


Rather it's designed (if they become more accurate) to show that you can understand what you're buying and going through. You don't need to just blindly buy and hold a good company if you can see that it'll sell off for a week. Things like that.  


You can hold through a sell-off, but if you want to make another entry and see that, you can wait to buy.

  
For something like MSFT, instead of buy at 260, wait for the next wave and buy in then. Holding is of course fine.",DarthTrader357,-2,/r/investing/comments/o4qyop/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/h2jo57m/,0.0,0.882,0.118,0.9774

54,TSLA," Does anyone know what actually motivated Burry to short TSLA?

He seems a bit of a ""one hit wonder"" and when you read an analysis of his analysis it seems like he landed on a no-brainer. I think often times we blind ourselves to reality because of what we believe in. And in the case of sub-prime, we believed housing couldn't lose value.

But, Burry rightly noticed that most of the mortgages had short term teaser rates and naturally their associated bond values would depreciate as the teaser rates expire.

That doesn't mean it's easy to short the market with that information. It takes balls to put money on the line. Especially a lot of money.

But, the question is what does he see about TSLA other than it's obvious fundamentals?

What does anyone else see as a problem with TSLA?

61,WISH," Because it's a battle between bears and bulls and the increased volume means an increase fervor to win.  


Plus, because for every buyer there's a seller. So the increased volume doesn't mean ""MORE buyers"" or ""MORE sellers"". It shows the intensity with which they care about the stock, as a group. Identifying who is winning that fight is important.  


It's basically a ""tie-goes-to-bears"" stock where I would expect its price to trade sideways with seeming large volatility meaning that you can probably predict the cyclic nature of ups and downs but in the terms of days or the week, probably won't gain much if you enter at the midpoint.

Adjusting for openings which on a stock like this could open up or down unless the company is driven by prices/costs of things like oil or other commodities.

I haven't looked at its price yet.

\---------------------------------  


Wow nailed it just by looking at sentiment on Jun-18.  


Well, that being said what price gain you see is ""illusory"". It may hold as a new normal but it's born out of a fight between bulls and bears. WISH is trading in a range so it can go either way and a bear can turn quick and maul you, so if you were thinking about entering, best to wait until sentiment is more bullish.

The more buyers that accumulate the more and more you become one in a crowd of steely knives. When a sell-off begins, big or small, some of those back stabbers leap first.

I'm not a financial advisor and if I was I would ask that you paid me for my services? But I would suggest knowing what your previous FA was holding, if you're getting out with cash or some assets, what amounts your working with as it would disproportionately alter the tax bill, and starting from there with an exit plan before contacting your accountant/CPA to figure out the most tax advantaged path. 

Just throwing out a question without the rest of the context doesn't allow for easy or great answers.

79,FCF," Thanks for the nice FCF analysis.

In general, this merger is all about debt management. To this end, I think the merger might be one step back, that will allow T to take multiple steps forward.

As part of the merger T is offloading debt into the new company. I don't know if the details of which have been finalized or made public. I also realize that this doesn't help current stock holders directly, because they'll still own the debt through their shares in the new company. But offloading the debt should help T's finical health and enable growth in the long run.

Second, as part of the merger T is dropping their dividend. I know they've received a lot of slack for this, but in the long run I think this is a good move. T's current dividend is frankly unsustainable. After the merger, T will still offer a decent dividend, but the payout ratio will be sustainable. The savings from the reduced dividend should help T address their post merger debt.

I'm still not sure how I feel about the new Discovery+Time Warner corp, but the merger gives me the ability to independently adjust my investment in T and the new corporation. I may just sell my shares after the merger and reinvest them elsewhere.",UWwolfman,7,/r/investing/comments/o4ztwe/att_merger_with_discovery_not_that_great_from_a/h2kjog5/,0.096,0.816,0.088,-0.1769

\- full time employed, $150k/yr

What are your objectives with this money? (Buy a house? Retirement savings?)

\- aiming for early retirement

What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs?

\- would like to retire from my current job by 50 and work part-time teaching (University level) for extra spending money

What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know its 100% safe?)

\- I'm mostly risk intolerant. I prefer steady and safer long-term moves. Got to this point taking small risks but not comfortable with it as much now as I get older.

What are you current holdings? (Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors? Any other assets?)

\- Currently debt free and own my own home. Have a 401k retirement acct with about \~500k, mostly in target date funds (see, I'm not that bright nor educated in investment strategies).

And any other relevant financial information will be useful to give you a proper answer.

109,IRS," Hi

I would disagree with the statement that your tax bracket will be the same when you retire.  Unless you do not plan to retire.  When you retire you control your bracket by simply increasing or decreasing your distribution from all the different accounts you have.  Look at Warren Buffet taxes.  In short your current tax bracket is highly dictated by your income from work, in retirement your bracket will be dictated by your distributions and thus, by you.

If you want to put money you already have in your pocket into a retirement account then Roth IRA is pretty much the only way to go since dollars into that account are post-tax.  If you want to put money you will earn now and in the future into a retirement account then you need a traditional IRA.  It is perfectly fine to have multiple retirement accounts just make sure you do not go over the allowable amount by the IRS tax rules.  

If you want to save even more for retirement you can open a self directed brokerage account and simply manage it as if it was a retirement account, just don't sell and you don't pay any taxes now.

Good luck investing, sincerely,

110,XOM," examine your strategy and your capabilities. why?

example 1: you bought XOM, went up by 50% in 3 days. you sold all for 100k. you were taxed 27% or say 40%, so you pay 40k and pocketed 60k.

example 2: you bought XOM, held it for years and gained about 50K and only have to pay 15%. so you pay 7.5k and pocketed 42.5k(for keeping it for years).

so which one is more beneficial?

there are pros and cons on both sides. higher taxes doesn't always mean bad, it means you earn more. i do options and when stocks go up by 10-20%, that's already a 20-40% gain for me so I sell. it's a win-win situation, I will get taxed but only on my gains, and tax is used for the US.

112,IMO," There's always risk with everything. There's no guarantee and that's why there is a payoff for the investment risk. With that said a long term (5-30yr) investment in the S&P500 would probably be in the green regardless of when you get in. And the earlier the better.

To OP: I understand you concerns, but the S&P500 isn't some new DeFi short-CDS token that can fall 99% overnight or some gaming retailer stock that can drop dramatically if it becomes less popular. Try looking at our friends/cousins over at WSB. They take ridiculous amounts of risk. Compared to that buying the VOO and slowly adding to it over time with the plan to withdraw far in the future is the best choice. The most important part is starting NOW so it has more time to compound.

LT investors/advisors would usually answer that there is not right time but ""NOW"" is better than ""LATER"" as ""time in the market beats timing the market"".

However I understand that by NOT investing for long periods I take the risk of missing out on gains and compounding.

I pulled up a quick google search since we were on the subject and it looks like T holders will receive 71% of the new “global entertainment media company” while Discovery holder will receive the remaining 29%, so T is likely the favorable position to hold if you’re sights are on the new company(which isn’t expected to finalize until mid-2022 btw). T is also receiving about $43bil in assets(cash, debt securities, and WarnerMedia retaining some of T’s debts) through the deal. T says once the deal is completed it will shift its focus back to broadband, 5G, and Fiber. Shareholders will retain their current stake in T and the additional new stake of 71% of the yet-to-be-formed WM/Discovery company will be granted beside it.

134,IT," Okay, let me explain what I mean.

&#x200B;

If some investor buys a grow company on its peak and then all of a sudden whole market becomes red, there is no buyers anymore for that stock, so investor will either loose his capital or will be forced to sit tight for next decade until market and that company will recover, there is no alternative because company in debt and produces so little profit compare to it's overall price. That is what I mean by asking if investing becomes more speculative.

&#x200B;

Whereas if investor buys value company that pays dividends, even though they are overvalued(not as some grow companies from IT sector) and market reverses for few years, guy might use dividends as a pivot and in fact increase returns and amount of shares he owns.

Recency bias?

142,ITUB," I think brasilian banks could also be a good play right now. Yes the have a lot of trouble with Covid still (although the have developed an own vaccine) but with the raise of the base rate by. 75% I see some potential there. Their currency is also the strongest in years right now all profiting financial institutes. Last week I saw some mentions about ITUB on Reddit and WSB because Warren Buffett invested in another brasilian bank. ITUB had some bad news in the near past, but are now starting fresh with a new CEO and are very well established in crypto currencies for a normal bank.",Allegra125,1,/r/investing/comments/o54eli/i_think_bank_stocks_are_now_a_good_buy/h2kril3/,0.056,0.784,0.16,0.8804
143,JPM," Why do you believe the floor to be in the high 140s? Usually when talking about price ""floors"" it's really more of a price ""support"" that is identified through technical analysis. Without the technical analysis (which isn't to say I am a big believer in the accuracy technical analysis) the ""floor"" is more of a gut feeling. 

That's not to say JPM isn't a good buy since bank stocks are often a good investment during times of inflation, but your rationale seems flawed.",RevolutionaryLog6566,1,/r/investing/comments/o54eli/i_think_bank_stocks_are_now_a_good_buy/h2kshbn/,0.043,0.939,0.018,-0.2556

145,UTI," Thursday Friday were really stacked against banks. They were selling off, bearish sentiment (but growing bullish).

The news was chattering about sell offs. Pumping that mantra.

But it held in the high 140s.

It pulled away from the downtrend with lower volume which is a strong sign the trend is breaking.

It snapped back to trend only during high volume, also a sign the trend is breaking. 

It tested the bottom (floor) with above average volume by quite a lot. And it didn't break through but returned to its new range on lower volume...

Intraday sentiment has been bullish and is overcoming long range sentiment from past couple weeks.

The company has excellent fundamentals, is a good value already, has caught the eye of institutions at higher entry targets. One UTI entered at about $160 and matures in a year.

The CEO is a legend.

They are sitting on a massive war chest of cash.

The near term economic situation is positive in their favor.

So I just don’t see any sledgehammer coming to break that floor.",DarthTrader357,-2,/r/investing/comments/o54eli/i_think_bank_stocks_are_now_a_good_buy/h2ktxvw/,0.056,0.81,0.134,0.946
