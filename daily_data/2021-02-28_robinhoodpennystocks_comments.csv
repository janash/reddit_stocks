5,RH," First off, I am not a lawyer. I just listen to a lot of lawyers on the internet. Don't take legal advice from a reddit post. I am prepared to be downvoted, but hey, that's whatever.

Considering the part of the agreement that waives your right to class action lawsuits and makes issues be resolved via arbitration... No. RH is probably not going anywhere anytime soon. Not unless there is something seriously illegal about what they did that is brought to light. Since they made you agree that they could stop trading on any stock at any time due to volatility, that's going to be an incredibly tough case to argue... In arbitration.

So, why would a lawyer even bring the case if it's almost immediately going to get shot down due to lack of standing? Some lawyers love to take your money completely regardless of the chances of success. Others might still think there is a settlement they can get out of RH.

That doesn't make sense. You can transfer to another broker and pay a $75 fee for transfer of your portfolio (if you call customer service may waive the fee) or liquidate your positions and re-buy in.

Liquidating will create a taxable event, but at the end you're still going to be taxed no matter what. There is no excuse to stay with a shitty shady broker like RH now.

65,ASRT," I’d be shocked if things start turning around next week but there will probably diamonds in the rough. The question is finding them before they pop like XNXT did. Looking through upcoming earnings might be worth it.

Regardless, I’ll probably make this week the week to start buying dips here and there now that I’ve waited out what was basically a dip week. Namely will want to find a good chance to average down on ZOM and ASRT. The former getting that little rise in AH on Friday in particular is encouraging. If I can’t find any new exciting positions to pick up, at the very least I want to go a decent bit harder on my ZOM and ASRT positions. Probably will want to to try and grab CTRX at the best possible price too. 

With how insanely stable its price has been it probably won’t dip to 1.7 again but getting anything close to that would be sweet.
