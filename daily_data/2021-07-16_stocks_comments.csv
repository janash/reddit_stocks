1,VS," So whats happening is two parts Lockdown VS reopening Stocks and the aspects that affect those stories.  The market sold lockdown names but now has 2nd thought about the reopening based on inflation and covid variants, so they bought back lockdown names and sold reopening names.  Inflation is a factor because interest rates strongly influence the P/E ratio as tock can trade at as interest rates go up P/E goes down.  Covid reemergence is easy to understand.

I think this all gets put to sleep when earnings come out over the next 3 weeks.  They should be excellent.  All the reopening names are reporting and I think strong earnings now will trump worries about higher interest rates.  I'm looking at this as a pause that refreshes.",djh860,1,/r/stocks/comments/olikr8/whats_up_with_the_market/h5fbksy/,0.026,0.781,0.194,0.9783

4,BIG," Not an expert, but what I have learned is:  
1. Only institutions and BIG money trade after hours, regular joe does not have that option.

2. Trading after hours can allow big money to buy and sell in large blocks without unexpected interference (e.g. tons of little guys putting limit entry or sell orders).

So, if you are an institution that needs to rebalance your holdings, or an ETF, then maybe the best time is during after hours- perhaps a new stock just uplisted to a new stock exchange, so you need to add it to your holdings. So you place your 10 million stock order after hours so that people do not drive the price up, and break it into piecemeal orders, maybe use multiple exchanges, and by the time all the big players and bought and sold the price moves up and then down again. The only way to capitalize on this is to either make sure your broker allows ""after hours"" trading, or to place a limit sell/buy order that can go through after hours.",1011010110001010,1,/r/stocks/comments/olikr8/whats_up_with_the_market/h5fysvq/,0.013,0.927,0.061,0.8674

8,ES," If there is no volume premarket or after hours, how is it that the miniscule amount of volume can cause a drop in prices during high liquidity? It makes no sense. 

Maybe all of this has more to do with margin requirements, holding over close and liquidity drying up. Think about if you need to close a large position at a great price by the end of the day and the markets are tanking. You need to get out. You know there is no liquidity after like 5 hours. Nobody really knows how far it will drop and if you are still holding you might not get that pay hike.

If you think ""oh they just pump up during euro hours and dump during us markets"" go watch how dax/eurostoxx compare to the ES. Es just follows the european markets pretty closely and if they tried to pump up all the stocks/futures in low liquidity conditions they would get arbitraged out pretty fast. If they wanted to pump it up they would need to buy out everything from the eurozone stocks.",Smokii,1,/r/stocks/comments/olikr8/whats_up_with_the_market/h5g33y1/,0.08,0.847,0.073,0.2013

44,AI," There are are major technological changes looming over the next ten years which will transform society. Three of the most important are batteries, AI, and bio-tech. These mean that about 2/3rds of existing companies will go bankrupt by 2035, with the other 1/3rd booming, and a lot of yet-to-be-created firms dominating markets. So a young guy picking the correct stocks and waiting a decade could end up a millionaire. 

However, which firms will dominate is either (i) not obvious or (ii) overpriced. For example TSLA will probably dominate vehicles, taxis, energy storage, etc, whereas Ford and GM are in big trouble. If you had traded on that in  2017, you'd have down well. Now, everyone knows that, so massive future profits are built into the TSLA price while there is a huge bankruptcy factor priced into Fords & GM. Still, there is a lot going for TSLA, as its likely dominance (2030) is still not priced in, esp in automated manufacturing.

75,ANY," but after Amazon was ""just a book store"" and hell, even when they were, their growth could have been analyzed / discovered at any time.  Sure it would have been difficult to get in super early and know what they would become...but just imagine a few years of rapid growth and they had much further to go.  In other words, take all the small cap stocks, find out who traveled consistently far in valuation over n years (idk, 3 years?  5 years? not sure the most ideal value for it) then delve deeper into whichever did the best.  Or which went from small-cap to mid-cap, or from micro-cap to small cap, then analyze price and other metrics.  This would be how you would catch something like ""the next amazon"" if such a thing exists.

Another way is look back into Amazon's history.  Find consistent patterns between amazon and say facebook, google, etc., or obvious traits or patterns in their history. Then apply to the micro or small cap stocks of today.   Make your picks that way..maybe throw in a couple of other things like intrinsic value or other Buffet strategies.  It's all about reading and research.  I was a day-trader (failing mostly) and then swing trader (failing mostly) but now that I have decided to move on to just investing and running a business to funnel money into my investments, I have found that it's all about reading and research.  I no longer believe in technical analysis...you can find some patterns here or there, but ANY TA strategy you use, it will only work for a set time.  They all stop working.   Consistency was infinitely evasive.  With investing however, this doesn't seem to be an issue.  Reading old books on Munger, Buffet, Graham, etc.  has taught me things which are actually working really well passively even as I type this.  These guys are dinosaurs, but these techniques which made them successful continue to persevere.

The reason not everyone can invest like these guys I believe an be explained using 2 Buffet quotes.  One was (roughly) ""everyone wants to get rich, but no one wants to get rich slowly"" and the other was something about how it's not all about numbers and spreadsheets, but more about reading...researching.  I'm not saying fundamental > technical analysis at all.  He also goes on about how news is pointless because a lot of it is hype...and a lot of big guys own the media so they manipulate it (to disagree with this is infinitely naive or ignorant or both, and that is you, stay away from the stock market, or better yet stay so more realistic people like myself can take your money) so news is highly unreliable.  Learn more about the business side.  Some numbers do help, obviously, but you want to be able to paint the entire picture.  I'm not going to keep typing because most of this is out there if you start reading...particularly advice from Buffet.  That will prove these points better than I ever could.",alias_noa,2,/r/stocks/comments/ol3u8b/what_small_companies_today_have_the_potential_to/h5fuxwz/,0.056,0.795,0.149,0.995

133,NVDA," Tip to potential NVDA buyers:

Just average down.

You don't know where the bottom is. 

Just buy a little now, and a little later, if the price drops more.

No point buying at 500, 600 or some arbitrary number. If the price bottoms out around here, you will be kicking yourself for not buying at least a little.

We are down almost 15% from peak now. I would say this is a good point to start averaging down.",utilities_weather,-6,/r/stocks/comments/oldfxv/rstocks_daily_discussion_fundamentals_friday_jul/h5fhivl/,0.033,0.913,0.055,0.1796

180,LMND," True. I sold at a loss when I first started investing during the September correction. I made it back since. Personal experience (admittedly, very short), and historical data shows solid companies will always bounce back so just hold.

Different if you invested into a loss-making growth company (e.g. LMND, PINS) - thats high risk high reward. Then you gotta start reading through [balance sheets](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/obr0d5/an_indepth_guide_on_how_to_perform_deep_research/) and deciding if you want to keep your investments. Its time consuming, but consider it a side job because theres real money on the line.

Also; take profits. buy and hold forever is fine for etf's, dividend stocks and maybe megacaps - but for companies like roku, tsla, pltr etc, taking profits after the run up has worked great.

193,AMD," TLDR: I rant about intel and how lazy they are because they had no competition and are now getting shit on by AMD. Also Lisa Su kicks ass and Bob Swan was forced to step down in 2020 for how shitty Intel is. That‚Äôs why their price is stagnant and AMD has gone crazy over the past few years.

You can go buy a 11900k right now off Best Buy but a 5900x/5950x is still sold out. they make their own die and aren‚Äôt back ordered because so few people are buying.

The game is set up in their favor and they‚Äôre still losing. They got lazy with no competition for years and were happy making half assed parts, then AMD shows up the past few years and is stomping them. CPUs take years to develop so it‚Äôs not like they can pull a 180 in that same time. 

Also their new line of consumer CPUs maxes out at 8cores. With games become more and more multiple core dependent thats a terrible move that‚Äôll only push more market share to AMD. Not to mention they‚Äôre still stuck on 14nm process and AMD at 7nm and rumors (I say this loosely) that they‚Äôre going to 5nm in the next year or two.

In the same time (2015-present) it took Lisa Su to take AMD from unprofitable and large debt to gains YoY consistently and almost no debt, intel has stayed flat and increased debt by a few billion. This is evident by hedge funds involved with Intel pretty much forcing Bob Swan to step down as CEO.

Intel got caught with their pants down and took ages to respond.

It's hard to say how they will handle GPUs at this stage. 

I'd say it's definitely a speculative play. You're banking on them turning around CPU wise and doing well with their GPUs. Could go either way. 

Personally I'd prefer AMD due to their continued market share (hardware not shares) increase. Though they need to sort out their GPU pricing. RDNA 3 looks amazing but if the mutli chip high end card is 4 figures they can get stuffed.

199,AMD," GloFlo was originally AMD‚Äôs fab which was later spun off. One reason AMD has nearly completely dropped them is GloFlo is no long seeking to be cutting edge. Once you lose the competitive edge for node sizes, it‚Äôs next to impossible to recover it unless you sink billions to catch up. GloFlo could produce older chips, but nothing new or cutting edge.

The competition is between the design of the SoC itself. Apple engineers just designed a REALLY good chip using ARM license. They've been designing their own chips for a long time now so they have talent.

ARM by itself didn't provide some magical performance improvement. Look at Qualcomm and Samsung for a good example. Both use ARM to design their chips and they can barely compete with Apple's design.

AMD also uses x86 and has designed chips that can compete with Apple's designs and beat some of Intel's chips too. So again the competition is between the design itself and not the ISAs.",utalkin_tome,2,/r/stocks/comments/olm9my/intel_potential/h5fy5vt/,0.015,0.885,0.1,0.9154

Combined with the rollout of mass-production for their next-gen solar panels (scheduled around the time that contract expires), their manufacturing costs will also go down.

With all the FUD going around with inflation, I believe banks (Wells Fargo, JP, CITI, etc) will thrive as well as ‚Äúrecession proof‚Äù stocks like Colgate, Walmart, Target or even P&G so I suggest, at least for now, to go heavier in those stocks.

I will probably get a callout from this but I wouldn‚Äôt go in neither on NVIDIA or Palantir.

Non tech: McDonald‚Äôs, Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Starbucks, Walmart, Philip Morris, Citigroup

Tech: Xpev (EV company, kinda  like NIO but IMO more undervalued), Amazon, google, Microsoft, Paypal,Alibaba, Mastercard, Visa,

If you feel like a more ‚Äúvolatile market‚Äù throw in 10% in crypto, I own ADA and ETH now that are kinda undervalued but BE CAREFUL, it seems like its very bearish atm.
