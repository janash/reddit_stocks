11,DD," Thanks a lot for sharing this, OP. 

Did a lot of DD myself over the weekend and your post came as a much needed confirmation to everything good I've found about the company. 

The back to back offerings and trial settlement are great for the future growth of the company and hopefully will have a positive effect on their financial report as well (although it might be a bit too late for that).
I think the biggest short term catalyst is Assertio regaining compliance from the NASDAQ on Monday. It will surely have a positive effect on the share price leading up to that date and more so once it becomes official.
Let's hope for the best! GLTA 🙌🏻

14,DD," Really nice work on the DD. As far as my take on technical analysis, looking at previous trends, this stock has typically had rather harsh retracements with the majority of the runups being met with a >61.8% retracement. With that in mind, take this with a grain of salt, this new chart setup is panning out nicely in my eyes with a bullish retracement and respect of the 50% mark for the majority of the previous week. Overall, this stock has been bullish and is looking good. My hopes are to see a few tests around $1.38 this week. I'm with you on anything over $2 being quite ambitious, but we will see how this plays out. I will be holding my position for now.

TLDR: Macroscopic chart = bullish with significant retracements; Microscopic chart = bullish with bullish retracement. I will be holding my position.

31,DD," The most important thing about pennystocks you NEED to know is that **they're highly volatile**. 50% a day fluctuations? Say no more. This scanner tries to minimize this through setting reasonable floating stock setting, but still you have to keep that in mind.

This is the reason why you should do your own DD and not rely on this scanner - it just gives you tips, not 100% reliable stocks. You should do research about every stock that it gives you. Then even if something fucks up, you can go for long term, because after a good DD you'll be sure it will go up!

Recent feature in Dailymail UK http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9257503/amp/New-ovarian-cancer-drug-women-years-life.html

They are currently working on some great things including an HPV vaccine, Ovarian cancer vaccine, and a Covid antibody test. These are therapeutic vaccines used to treat these diseases instead of for prevention. (They also have a Covid vaccine in the works using T cell technology that is very different from the mRNA vaccines being used now.) 

The cancer vaccine technology uses haptenized proteins. ""Simply put, the process of haptenization “teaches” a patient’s immune system to recognize and make target proteins more ‘visible’ as foreign, thereby stimulating a more intense immune response.""

They just signed a billionaire investor by the name of Shmuel Farhi to be a corporate advisor. Seems like he's more of a real estate guy, so I'm guessing his role will be chief sugar daddy. 

I'm a newb, so I'm still looking for info on financials, etc.  This looks quite promising as a long term hold.

237,DD,"  I'm actually going to play $SOS tomorrow. There was some great DD that was posted 5 days ago [https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/lgulse/sos\_limited\_nyse\_sos\_undervalued\_and\_unnoticed/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=ios\_app&utm\_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/lgulse/sos_limited_nyse_sos_undervalued_and_unnoticed/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf). 

$SOS took a big jump last week, but I think that's just the start. $SOS came on my radar before I read the DD. I hesitated to buy them because I thought they already boomed, but I don't think it has reached its potential yet. You'll notice that their stock has taken a shit the past couple years, but imo I think this is the inflection point.

I like your system you have here, it’s very educational and informative and as much as stonks aren’t a team game, I feel it’s good form to encourage proper practices to newbies about stocks and taxes in general.

307,DD," 99% of OPs comment history is about CBBT. He’s calling out my post on CBBT, claiming that I’m the same person as someone who has made bearish comments on stocktwits about CBBT. His evidence? Nothing - he can’t seem to get his head around the fact that there is more than one person on social media who doesn’t share his bullish sentiment on CBBT. Claiming that all the bears have “the same sentence structure”, I doubt OP is a linguistic analyst. The truth is that the info online that suggests there’s something off with this company is easy for anyone to pick up, hence why people have tried to mention it amongst all the positive hype. But as soon as anyone brings to light something negative about the company, it is classed as an attack by people like OP. 

This guy is saying that bears don’t have your best interests at heart. You think this guy gives a fuck about your interests? 😂 All he’s doing is promoting his own investment so he can make more money. I don’t have a stake in this company, I used it as an example in my post and the CBBT army started commenting, making it a post about that stock specifically.

https://precisionbiosciences.com/our-approach/arcus-genome-editing/

As a side note, never invest in a CRISPR stock that’s going for gene therapy, it is a fundamentally flawed technology that creates unwanted off-target deletions. Even though those unwanted deletions are rare, they are significant and basically prevent a good clinical outcome. AGTC is not using CRISPR, so it has at least a decent chance of working.

349,CEO," Call me a degenerate. My ideas are my own and I am not a financial advisor. Just want to share my research.

Company: Celsion Corporation (CLSN)

This is a pharma company who is currently in the process of inventing a new treatment for advance ovarian cancel. The treatment is currently going through a phase 2 trial and according to the message provided by the CEO, we should receive data back in regards to this trial as in becomes available.

It is also in the process of making a COVID 19 vaccine and other general vaccines to fight viruses. The recent development derived from this process has the company created a Vaccine Advisory Board with its first 2 members added. I expect more quality members to be added this upcoming weeks. So there will be volatility.  The 2 people who were added are Dr. Glaunsinger and Dr. Yang. These 2 scientists have extensive track records in their fields. Dr. Glaunsinger specializes in virology and currently a professor at UC Berkeley, a top medical school. And Dr. Yang specializes very much the same but has practical experience in bringing vaccines to the market due to his leadership in his previous work at Pfizer. 

The company has millions in cash to further studies so that means they don’t need to
Dilute share holders. That’s a plus sign.

Finally, the company has a patent pending to be approved. Even if the company doesn’t produce the product, it could sell the patent rights to generate cash flow. 

So, the price is at 2.45 and I believe it could rise higher. Institutional buyers are buying this already and options strike price at 2.5 has large volume.  Can we see more than 10$ with this low flow? Maybe but we should keep our eyes on it. Target 10$ PT.

If you're holding it, look at volume.

I personally would not throw more than you can afford to ""lose"" at any one stock if for any reason it went back down to .0001 and stayed there for another 5-10 years. Best case scenario, it goes up and they become current, has news, but don't expect it to stay up. Worst case scenario is you ""lost"" what you put in.

407,DFS," I’d say around CAD $5 is my current target but I’ll re-evaluate and push that further out as lithium prices increase, peers continue to increase, and as more information surrounding cypress is released giving us a better understanding of their project (pilot plant results, dfs, permitting, securing h2o source, offtake agreements, ROD, etc...)
What I find interesting (and didn’t get into in the original post) is that cypress has only explored something like 1/2 of their property. They stopped drilling early because they found so much lithium they already could feasibly estimate a resource that would produce the 27,000tpd LCE for 40+ years. But in one of those Don Mosher vids I dumped at the end, he clearly talks about how any company could easily come in and build out twice the size of the operation. Bill explains in the crux interview that this operation can be scaled linearly up or down to either half production or double it. Ie. if you want a mine that does 13,500tpd LCE instead of 27,000tpd, you only need to front 50% of the capital. Likewise, you could probably operate a 54,000tpd op if you had twice the cash to build the mine. You might say, yeah but how can you assume there is Li? Well other early stage companies currently drilling around cypress’s property limit have also been finding lithium, meaning the deposits may stretch the entire extent of the property. Some are speculating that cypress raised more money than needed in the recent financing so they could also do additional drilling concurrently to the pilot plant construction so when they write the DFS they can actually increase the resource estimate size to truly show how much potential this site has.

425,DD," All of these can be bought on Fidelity.

**ETFM:** In my notes I have that the pretext for this rising seems to be that the ticker is changing to FOMO, as well as some other business changes related to that. This has risen more than others I am mentioning, but the 5-day chart shows a steady increase. There might be another price jump before/if it is significantly dumped.

**FHBC:** At .00307, there is room to grow. There was a small drop Friday, but it may be consolidating at a new base price.

**GRSO:** Showing a steady rise in recent history. Room for significant percentage increases quickly at .0055. Agricultural company (aerogrow) with weed associations that is still cheap and located in Canada so not affected by US laws. Edit: Though I think it now has more to do with sustainable growing technology than weed in particular.

**PPJE:** This did see significant gains recently, but I left all in besides my investment because I think there will be another biggish rise based on the chart.

**SAML:** Very cheap at .0018 and just starting to catch on Friday. This actually appears to be a legitimate company with products frequently mentioned in top-5 articles on products in its sector (smart luggage) on sites like Forbes and Tom's Hardware. They also have an apparel company, where the luggage is also advertised. Problem: a significant reverse stock split is planned, which at best would consolidate 4000 shares to one share. I think this will inevitably be dumped because of that. I only bought 11 cents' worth of shares because I am curious if I will be given a full stock when that is over, as it says if we don't have enough to equal a full share, it will be rounded up to the nearest full share.

**SIML:** .0036 and more or less holding after an increase. Like some of the others, I feel like this will go up more. My notes mention cannabis connections and partnerships with major, recognizable corporations.

**SSFT:** Holding steady at about .24, only slightly below the last peak. It may be a chance to buy a dip before another increase.

**XMET:** After a couple of days of reconciliation, it may make another upwards push. Watch it Tuesday. My notes say, ""New custodianship under David Lazar. Reverse merger suspected, which he has successful experience with apparently.""

Another one that is more expensive than these is **NOVN**. It has gone up a lot already, though I have been getting consistent gains from it for a while. The DD I read that first drew my attention to it mentioned selling it before completion of a study on March 25th (as the results could be good or bad). I'm also holding this longer than most penny stocks.

Candles and volume over time can be very informative at a glance when it comes to gauging the ratio of buyers to sellers, thats kinda what they’re made for. TA is a just a dark arts method of gauging sentiment, because the way people really feel about a stock can be seen by what they do with their money, not what they say on boob-tube or interwebs.

I do appreciate however when someone who posts a DD takes care and time to respond to comments that bring to light red flags or raise questions - and actively participate in a dialogue about said stock. Anyone posting their own DD should *hope* to get back just as much information as they put in to give to the community, so they can have a fuller picture of where they're putting their money.

620,DD," This really isn't a catalyst stock, it is more of a get in on the ground floor and wait it out. There appears to be a lot going on behind the scenes, with a potentially large financial backer, and of course being a renewables play.  There is a lot of very interesting DD out there right now, more or less trying to connect the dots as to who that backer may be.  As with all of the positions I listed above, my best advice is if you decide to buy in, pull out your initial investment on a pop and ride the free shares to diversify your portfolio.

623,GM," I'm very interested with RevoltToken being somewhat connected to etherium, but using the ICO and subsequent earnings as a strategy to fund the production and distribution of electric motorcycles in Sub-Saharan Africa seems....strange to say the least.

Affordability, demand, infrastructure?  Getting current technology into developing countries is a GREAT idea and should be the goal of most alt energy companies.  From what I can tell (as of Feb 5, 2021) they only have plans to roll out the infrastructure needed to charge the bikes.  Kenya is set up nicely, with an established electrical grid, but the average income is only about $7k USD ($800k KES) and the bikes are $1,300 USD.  I don't see many people jumping to buy when climate change probably doesn't cross the mind of a VAST majority of citizens living in Sub-Saharan Africa.

Will there also be infrastructure to train and place mechanics in positions to fix these as well?  A lot of great ideas coming from this company, but if there was real profit or long term growth potential in this then GM, Hyundai, Honda, VW, Toyota or others already very popular in in region would have already begun the process.  LOOOOOOOOOONG term hold maybe, but I personally don't see much coming from this.

RSI helps you to know if the price is over or under valued. It’s not perfect but it helps me judge entry and exits.

Ownership rates, especially recent acquisitions, can indicate things are gonna move.

Now float is tricky. You need it to be small if you want the stock to move rapidly in price but that cuts both up and down. If they have a good catalyst, like FDA approval or a new item released they can make you a pretty penny.

661,DNN," Uranium (DNN) and Oil (GTE) are the next runners. DNN has multiple upcoming catalysts, such as the reduction of uranium supply by several countries, which will result in lower supply and similar demand = higher prices

As for oil, Biden has reversed Trump’s Energy policies, hence decreasing the production of oil in the US. A barrel of oil went from $45 to $60 in 6-8 weeks and will continue rising. Additionally the Fed is continuing the expansion of money supply, which results in a weaker dollar. Weak dollar = high oil prices

That said I'm still only looking and not buying at the minute,New_Age_Jesus,2,/r/pennystocks/comments/lka9as/rr_confirmation_bias_required/gnjn8wr/,0.02,0.901,0.078,0.6124

671,SP, There are only a few LP that have backing from a major alcohol or tobacco company and Auxly is one of them. Imperial brands invested 123mil and it's.convertavle to 19.9 % at an SP of $0.81. this is going to touch that extremley soon they will convert 100%. And they just sold their Cohiba cigar business for billions. And that's probably to pursue good old maryjane.

678,NAK," I am unbelievably bearish on NAK.  I used to live in one of the nearest communities to Pebble Mine and personally know a few of the contractors who were lined up for that project.  I don’t see the appeal being successful and the chances of Pebble getting permitted in the next decade are slim to none.  

Pebble commissioned a study a number of years ago to look at building a 140km slurry pipeline to Anchorage area and to do extraction and refining there.  They need to go back and look at that concept again.  As long as they are trying to refine at the headwaters of Bristol Bay, that mine plan is DOA in my humble opinion...",SnidelyWhiplash1,3,/r/pennystocks/comments/lki3id/anyone_care_to_vet_my_swing_plays_for_tuesday/gnk2r4h/,0.034,0.907,0.059,0.2185
