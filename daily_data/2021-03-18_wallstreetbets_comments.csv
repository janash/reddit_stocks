49,GME," 🚀 Good Morning Everyone!!! 🚀

🚀 Look in my profile for yesterday's thread 🚀

🚀 **Live Thread** 🚀

**4:01 Update**

Holy fuck. GME is above 200. Battle tomorrow is going to be for 200. What we just saw is most likely a taste of the crazy tomorrow is going to bring. The HFs have little shorts available so it's going to be interesting to see how they bring this price down.

What a day.

Current price: 201.29

**3:40 Update**

This is the prequel to tomorrow's Battle for 200. The big kids are using today to establish precedent for tomorrow. If GME ends above 200, it will only continue to legitimize it's current value. If it ends below 200, people might see it as a sign that GME is slipping. I want to be clear, this is not what I believe, but rather what they probably believe based on the battle going on right now.

It's going to be wild to the end.

Current price: 199.10

**3:21 Update**

The battle continues. After a sharp drop down, there was a sharp rise back up. This is either shorts closing or a whale buying up shares. GME is above 200 again and as of now, it looks as though the HF attack failed. I have no idea how this is going to end.

What a fucking Power Hour.

Current price: 202.25

**3:11 Update**

Well this has gotten really interesting. The slow fall started just at 2:00. This continued all the way slowly getting to 200. It landed at 200 just before 3:00. Right at 3, GME experienced a drop of $3, and all of the sudden volatility kicked up. There seems to be a battle going with GME thrashing and trying to get itself above 200 again. This all seems too convenient to have all been natural. HFs played a patient game and struck right on power hour. Will GME end up above 200 today? Power Hour is in full swing.

Current price: 196.85

**2:51 Update**

GME seems to be inching it's way down, barely crossing below 200. At how slow it's going, I can't tell if this is a natural downward trend it if it's a long and slow move by the HFs. We'll see if there's any sort of stability around 200 or if it goes back up towards 205 or higher.

Happy Power Hour y'all!

Current price: 199.86



**2:30 Update**

Not much has changed. GME is a little but lower, but it's just likely just general volatility. Power hour coming up. We'll see if anyone makes any more moves today.

Current price: 204.01

**2:00 Update**

I want to address a few things to look out for. First, they may not have fired all 400,000 shorts, so if there's an attack in the next two hours, don't be surprised.

Also, I was going to wait until tomorrow to mention this, but the HFs really want the price below 200 because there are a lot of puts at that price point. Puts practically disappear above 200. Their best chance at some sort of victory this week is if GME ends below 200. However, I don't believe that the damage done would be that great given how resilient GME has been for the past week.

GME has stabalized around 206. We'll probably see at least one more shift before the day is done.

Current price: 207.77

**1:26 Update**

Oh look, GME is rising again. It only down 1.5% now. 400,000 shorts to drop a stock 1.5% from it's previous close and it still has upward momentum? I'll be surprised if it closes at anywhere below -2% and would guess that it'll end up at least at yesterday's close if not fully in the green. Let's see what the HFs will do next.

Current price: 206.46

**1:02 Update**

If you zoom out, you'll see that GME has been steadily dropping since 11:30. You could make the argument that the general public is selling, but the volume during this time period just doesn't support that evidence. Even with this drop, it still can't establish stability below 200. 

We'll see if that happens, but I still image that GME will finish at least close to yesterday's close if not in the green.

Just think about this, If they fired 400,000 GME and who knows how many ETF shorts and the price ends at -2%. Where do they get the shorts to go back to pre squeeze levels? They only have 150,000 GME shorts left. They also have to buy back the shorts at some point. I just don't see a strategy that doesn't involve some sort of negative bombshell news report that fundamentally changes the thesis.

They can keep kicking the can down the road, but they have to concede that they made a mistake and get out of their positions.

* Current price: 204.74

**12:49 Update**

Let me put it this way, if the best they can do is secure a 2% loss, how many -2% do they need to get GME back to pre squeeze levels? The need SO many things to go their way for them to even have the time to chip GME away at this rate.

GME is so strong right now and every day that goes by only shows GME getting stronger.

Yes, it's down from it's high last week, but the floor keeps climbing. The HF need the price to go down to at least pre squeeze levels. They aren't even close to accomplishing that.

* Current price: 203.24

**12:43 Update**

The attack continues, but they can't even get it to stay below -2%. They still can't break 200. They're trying really hard to get a panic going, but GME keeps going back up after each attack. They'll run out of ammo eventually and I anticipate GME climbing back into the green. GME is showing so much resilience right now and there are so many people that are holding on and aren't phased by these drops. 

They still have to buy back the shares.

* Shorts available: 150,000

* Current price: 204.78

**11:57 Update**

Pre lunch attack is underway. Those that have been following have probably noticed that this is a common strategy they use. Drop the price before lunch so that people panic sell at their lunch break.

Hasn't really been successful in the past. We'll see if that changes today.

* Shorts available: 150,000

* Current price: 208.54

Also, I was going to wait until tomorrow to mention this, but the HFs really want the price below 200 because there are a lot of puts at that price point. Puts practically disappear above 200. Their best chance at some sort of victory this week is if GME ends below 200. However, I don't believe that the damage done would be that great given how resilient GME has been for the past week.

GME has stabalized around 206. We'll probably see at least one more shift before the day is done.

Current price: 207.77

**1:26 Update**

Oh look, GME is rising again. It only down 1.5% now. 400,000 shorts to drop a stock 1.5% from it's previous close and it still has upward momentum? I'll be surprised if it closes at anywhere below -2% and would guess that it'll end up at least at yesterday's close if not fully in the green. Let's see what the HFs will do next.

Current price: 206.46

**1:02 Update**

If you zoom out, you'll see that GME has been steadily dropping since 11:30. You could make the argument that the general public is selling, but the volume during this time period just doesn't support that evidence. Even with this drop, it still can't establish stability below 200. 

We'll see if that happens, but I still image that GME will finish at least close to yesterday's close if not in the green.

Just think about this, If they fired 400,000 GME and who knows how many ETF shorts and the price ends at -2%. Where do they get the shorts to go back to pre squeeze levels? They only have 150,000 GME shorts left. They also have to buy back the shorts at some point. I just don't see a strategy that doesn't involve some sort of negative bombshell news report that fundamentally changes the thesis.

They can keep kicking the can down the road, but they have to concede that they made a mistake and get out of their positions.

* Current price: 204.74

**12:49 Update**

Let me put it this way, if the best they can do is secure a 2% loss, how many -2% do they need to get GME back to pre squeeze levels? The need SO many things to go their way for them to even have the time to chip GME away at this rate.

GME is so strong right now and every day that goes by only shows GME getting stronger.

Yes, it's down from it's high last week, but the floor keeps climbing. The HF need the price to go down to at least pre squeeze levels. They aren't even close to accomplishing that.

* Current price: 203.24

**12:43 Update**

The attack continues, but they can't even get it to stay below -2%. They still can't break 200. They're trying really hard to get a panic going, but GME keeps going back up after each attack. They'll run out of ammo eventually and I anticipate GME climbing back into the green. GME is showing so much resilience right now and there are so many people that are holding on and aren't phased by these drops. 

They still have to buy back the shares.

* Shorts available: 150,000

* Current price: 204.78

**11:57 Update**

Pre lunch attack is underway. Those that have been following have probably noticed that this is a common strategy they use. Drop the price before lunch so that people panic sell at their lunch break.

Hasn't really been successful in the past. We'll see if that changes today.

* Shorts available: 150,000

* Current price: 208.54

90,REAL," Morning you glorious tards - longish read but what else do you have to do but sit on shares?

I don't think short interest is (only) what's driving the price down anymore - I think **we have a quasi-short situation** in which certain player(s) are selling tons of naked calls (I mean, **have you SEEN the price of a 220 call contract these days?** Hell, they’re so high that if you could sell naked calls, you probably would.) In order to keep selling these calls but not deliver shares, they need two things to happen: 1 .The share price needs to stay outside of profitability for the call buyer, but ideally OTM. (as opposed to ATM, which hopefully they’re doing real soon. Googles it or ask your wife’s BF.) 2. Volatility needs to stay high. (The main factor in higher call contract prices.)

This is why we're seeing closing prices stay relatively flat, but mid-day volatility (the main factor in keeping call contract prices high) high as fuck. These assholes realize us tards are in it for the long haul, AND that we've accumulated a ton of the float, which is just a fucking perfect situation for their small volume dumps leading to high volatility. They could even slowly accumulate a relatively small amount of shares during quiet intra-day times, say 200k, and then suddenly dump mid-day, creating a shitload of volatility. Losing a few hundred thousand bucks once a day doing this is worth it when you sell as many naked calls as you want. It’s like tossing breadcrumbs to ducks if you’re into fucking ducks. And these assholes are definitely into fucking ducks.

**How do we fight this kind of quasi-short selling?** Well, good news is we are already doing it - accumulating the float at dips. Owning more shares, as always, gives us a ton of power to join institutional buyers to drive Friday’s close price up REAL fast, (less float=more volatility in either direction) causing call sellers to purchase shares to cover their calls, cascading an upwards price spiral, just like a short squeeze (which would also happen at the same time.) Buying 250 contracts is a gamble, (and fucking expensive) but might be worth it if the cascade effect runs away on Friday. Looking at contract prices and activity, I'd say they have calls out as low as 220, because profitability for these is about a 250 share price. (btw - FUCK!)  Meaning, if we can get to approach 250 by 3:30, we could see a runaway train of purchasing to cover calls, as well as whatever short squeeze we've got left. (EDIT: if this doesn't happen, it's still good news - they roll their calls into the next week/month, and keep the price creeping up slowly, and extends the time to keep accumulating shares. It also adds some sanity to watching crazy intra-day drops and why it's happening.)

Please note: I'm not a financial advisor, **I am retarded and my mom has to do my shoe's velcro in the morning**.

Edit: Short interest may have approached 140%, but with this situation, who the hell knows, maybe they sold calls at 500%. It could get super interesting.

After the apes took over the world, they let all Diamond handed humans live in peace while the rest is forced to ride on electric-generating bikes every day all day so we have clean energy.

Gamestop is the only shop on the world. They expanded their business to food, drinks and bananas.

The world currency is $GME.

When the aliens came, we tell them about the tale of GME, and they will spread the message about our victory and peace between species around the galaxy.

Universal peace is achieved and eventually the entire universes currency is $GME.

$GME HODL-ers are seen and treated as the gods of the universe.

But then.. a rougue HedgeFund AI (HF-AI) has unknowingly manifested itself throughout the galaxies. It was the last defense of the HedgeFunds. They didnt get the chance to activate it before the MOASS happenes.

It had infected everything. Every planet. Every machine. It planted so-called 'HedgeNests' in all systems everywhere. Without us knowing HF-AI had already reactivated old unused production factories a long time ago and made uncountable armies of Hyper advanced Jim Cramer Murder bots.

On the 28th of januari, 2050 the war began.

Many Apes dies. Many Diamondhands died. It seemed life, as we knew it, was over. But then.. We all thought he had left. We all thought he went to the Diamond planet and abandoned us. Some had hope he returned, some gave up. Some were angry, some were sad.

But the diamondmessiah came. DeepFuckingValue came back.

He had a plan all along. Of course he had a plan. Of course he saw it coming. But if he told us apes about HF-AI, humanity and ape would panic too soon, and HF-AI would activate when we would try to destroy it. We wouldve lost right away. There was no other way...

DFV already hacked and disabled 90% of JCM-bots without making things worse...

The word of DFV saving the universe from total destruction quickly got around. The High Gods of Life and Death visited us. They visited him. The High Gods of Life and Death wanted DeepFuckingValue to become a god of life and death, and make sure the universe was safe from the other timelines, where the MOASS, the Gamma Squeeze, never happened.

Without DeepFuckingValue, without all of us Diamondhands, we wouldnt have seen a day after the day the squeeze should have happened. And its all because of us...



Now then, do you really need more reason to hold strong, until we win? We will win. Its written in the prophecies... Hold your diamond hand. And hold my hand. Hold your neighbours hand. We are all together. We are not paperhands. We are winning. We are WallStreetBets. We are a magnificent bunch of apes. But most of all, and you should never ever forget this: we are fucking retarded.

So i propose this : if you think that a post about another stock is a distraction, don’t read it, don’t comment and move on. Let people that actually understand DD’s and TA’s read it so they can make up their minds if they want to invest in that.

217,GME," I decided to get into investing early January, and had lurked this sub from time to time for a while before that. This sub is what kind of convinced me to finally jump. I'm skittish with my money. Rightfully so.. hard earned and easily burned through.

I played GME, I had some fun and made some money. I listened to the mob-think and didn't take profit when profit was double my yearly income. Consequently, I settled for half my yearly income when I came to my senses.

Sure, that's nothing to scoff at. Biggest payday of my life. Doesn't change that.. that's not me.. I don't typically let outside noise cloud my judgement. Matter of fact, it's crucial that I don't because my mental well being *will* spiral. Small parts of it were greed and hope for some financial independence, I admit.

For that same reason, I'm calling GME a win and leaving it be. Godspeed to GME holders. I hope you all profit bigly with your diamond balls.

Me? I'm mostly back to lurking for a while. It's difficult to even see non-GME stuff when it's drowned out.. let alone determine if it's legit or HF fuckery.

273,DD," Hello, GME holder here. I'm terribly sorry for the conduct of some people who also happen to like the stock. All memes aside, there's plenty of opportunities to make money in the market other than GME. Personally, I'm of the mindset that GME might possibly (not necessarily plausibly) reach 100k or something crazy, however, it might not and that's fine.

Please have patience with the GME crowd, many of us are learning about the specifics of the market for the first time. From what I can tell, the reason why some lash out is that not only groupthink, but also the sheer magnitude of how much they feel they're being screwed over (the Jan halting of trade, the Robinhood stuff that came out today, and all manner of twists on the truth.)

I know this sounds cliche, but some people genuinely see GME as a way of making it to a better life. This gets people emotional and well, frankly prone to lashing out. I'm terribly sorry for the mudslinging going on towards genuine DD, frankly, people should just not read them if they don't care for them or can't approach them civilly.

Honestly, as much as I'm in on the GME hype train, sometimes I try to ground myself by reading ""controversial"" to make sure I'm not entirely disjointed from reality. That being said, I am a retail worker in college and the idea of financial independence fills me with hope. I could retire early, I could donate to a good cause, I could pay off the mortgage my parents have on their house so they could actually have money in the bank at the end of the month (etc.).

I wish everyone else the best with your investing decisions and hope things remain civil. Happy investing everyone and I hope you make tons of cash in whatever you're invested in!

Realistically I see MAYBE 2k at peak and if it rises much higher than that some fuckery will go on no doubt.

GME is not a bad play if you have the money to spare BUT you ,99% chance, won’t become a millionaire off of anything less 100+ shares bought at ~120 or less which most people including myself don’t have and can’t afford. (Estimates, I don’t feel like doing math rn)

It started as a solid play and became more of a pipe dream (while still a solid play) that everyone thinks will make them rich next month. We are retards, not stupid and just “hodl” until 100k a share is stupid.

And just because someone talks about GME here, that doesn’t mean they’re apes. Among the non-apes who stayed, a lot of their comments are complaining about apes/diamond hand bullshit. Your analytics would show those users as “talking about GME,” but to call them apes is just ridiculous (unless your analytics are on some next-level shit, which I doubt). 

Combine that with the fact that there are waaaaay more newcomers than older guys, an overwhelming majority of which are apes, and you have what you see today: a garbage ass front page and a shell of the former-WSB sub.

From these charts it shows that Lumber is extremely expensive now, lithiums gaining ground fast, while oil has broken out of downward cycle that  had been happening over the last few years.


Further info on oil. Back in 2017, Russia and OPEC pretty much declared war on the US shale producers and purposely knocked prices down to drive smaller producers in the shale patch out of business.

Only recently they announced that this war was over and that we shouldn't be surprised to see oil prices past $80 this year. 


Lithiums a given because many companies are now planning the switch to electrical. While i live in an area where lumber is a huge industry, and many of these guys can't get days off and are working really long hours. Other places for due diligence, i know a manager at Home Depot, basically told me they can't keep lumber on the shelves and prices have well over doubled.


My choices, I used 2 ETFs for Lumber Wood and Cut, and lit for lithium. Then i chose 6 different oil companies TNK, CAPL, ENB, SU, IMO, BPMP, and SHLX. I chose these companies based on profitability ratios such PE, PEG, and debt amounts, and tried to nail all parts of the market from tankers, pipelines, producers etc. 


Dependent on tomorrow though i may also enter some short positions depedent on what i see out of the markets. Against stocks like TSLA and other over priced tech companies. Yeah, that may not make me allot of friends. But if tomorrows down over 1% that could be a really negative sign.

414,TSLA," Well, late last year, i began hearing rumblings about this cycle on real vision.  From a few different investors.

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=I0Ysm-dqMN4


https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=V48D82KJel0

Folliwing that, i began looking at the various indexs for Agriculture, Lumber, oil, and lithium prices. 




https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/crude-oil#:~:text=Crude%20oil%20is%20expected%20to,53.36%20in%2012%20months%20time.


https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/lumber

https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/lithium


From these charts it shows that Lumber is extremely expensive now, lithiums gaining ground fast, while oil has broken out of downward cycle that  had been happening over the last few years.


Further info on oil. Back in 2017, Russia and OPEC pretty much declared war on the US shale producers and purposely knocked prices down to drive smaller producers in the shale patch out of business.


https://www.worldoil.com/news/2020/3/6/putin-dumps-opec-to-start-a-war-with-america-s-shale-oil-industry


https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/15/business/energy-environment/gas-oil-petrol-opec.html

Only recently they announced that this war was over and that we shouldn't be surprised to see oil prices past $80 this year. 


Lithiums a given because many companies are now planning the switch to electrical. While i live in an area where lumber is a huge industry, and many of these guys can't get days off and are working really long hours. Other places for due diligence, i know a manager at Home Depot, basically told me they can't keep lumber on the shelves and prices have well over doubled.


My choices, I used 2 ETFs for Lumber Wood and Cut, and lit for lithium. Then i chose 6 different oil companies TNK, CAPL, ENB, SU, IMO, BPMP, and SHLX. I chose these companies based on profitability ratios such PE, PEG, and debt amounts, and tried to nail all parts of the market from tankers, pipelines, producers etc.

Reduced capacity, wearing a mask while watching a movie... It's still going to be a hard sell for a lot of people who could just sit at home in comfort watching a movie there.

Hopefully in the coming months as vaccines become available to the general population and masks requirements are lifted, then we will really start to see an influx in people going back to the movies...

AMC is still a good long buy... People are definitely getting itchy to get out and enjoy things again... 

Personally, if I can't go to the theater and be comfortable, what's the point.. I'm not going to go. That's just me.

I honestly think that if someone other than AT&T owned HBO, the prices would be much higher for $T as strange as it sounds.  Few people realize that AT&T owns HBO, and I think the hidden agenda of why John Oliver keeps insulting AT&T is simply so people start to realize this fact.  ""Hey guys!?  Umm... buy $T!  Who is $T?  Well, that is AT&T!  And AT&T owns HBO Max!""  What do you guys think?

Nonetheless, AT&T did not say they were releasing their movies only on their service which is a smart move.  And, they are not charging extra for them like Disney+.  $30 for a movie to watch on a streaming service you are already paying for?  That sounds like a rip-off to me.

491,AMC," The issue is the massive amount of debt.  AMC did make money in 2018... they made $110M of profit.   And they lost money in 2019, so the lack of profitability has nothing to do with covid.  But what covid left them with was piles of debt.  Before that they were just treading water, but they now have $2.9B in debt pulling them under.

So even if they have a couple of good quarters and clear a hundred million or so in profit, it doesn't really help them.  They need billions, and they are not going to get that.

That's where these $2 and $1 price targets come from, and why that one guy has the $0.01 price target.  In order to avoid bankruptcy they need to get that debt off their balance sheet or they are going to get crushed servicing it.  It's no longer enough to just be profitable.  There is 0 shareholder value until they pay that off.  They are probably going to have quarters where they turn a profit operationally, but then servicing the debt pushes them into the red.

The best case scenario is that they issue a ton of new equity and the shareholders get diluted like crazy.  Worst case is that they are bankrupt.",Keith_13,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m7asag/amc_theatres_to_have_98_of_its_us_locations_open/grbinjv/,0.172,0.695,0.133,-0.7907

When chewy was launched, there were relatively few online competitors.

It's now 2021, and online pet supply sales is still under 50%, but they (chewy) have like 40% of that market.  There is still a ton of upside for e-com.

Videogames in the US are a smaller market (still huge, but closer to 60B).  Games themselves are 80%+ digital sales to begin with (as of 2018) and consoles have very little if any profit margin (controllers and accessories are where it's at).  Good luck to a B&M store trying to take you to the moon.  Cohen is going to transform GME and make them not get owned by amazon how?  We can already buy the software directly from MS/Sony/Nintendo/Steam/etc...  I'm not sayin that there isn't room for a B&M hybrid online GME going well into the future.  But that certainly isn't a growth company unless they start giving handies in the back alley.

GME is going to have a MUCH tougher time regardless of what Cohen does to ""break into"" the online gaming market.  I just ordered some dog food from Chewy yesterday, and I have ordered from them in the past before they dropped the brand (origen) that I feed my dog previously.  I then ordered from Amazon and/or petflow for literally exactly the same price with the same service.  I think Chewy is great.  Chewy solves a problem for me: I can't find the brand of food I want outside a few speciality stores that I have to go out of my way to get to.

On the other hand, I buy a new console every 5 years along with an extra controller or two.  That's the only phyiscal purchase I need to make, and frankly I don't think GME will make that process better than anyone else.  Furthermore, they bundle stupid shit with them around launch time to upsell you (good for them), so why the hell would I go there.

In conclusion, unless GME is going to give M$, Sony, Nintendo, and the various independent game studios that produce console and PC games UNLIMITED handies for discounts on their games so that they can sell them cheaper and still make a profit when those above companies are literally doing all they can to kill phyiscal media, cut out the middle man (GME), and more efficiently make profits themselves, I'm not convinced.  Two controllers, a charging tower, and some misc $17 chinese accessories every 5 years isn't going to take you to the moon.  But it did turn Cohen's $76 mil investment into $1.4B.  Perhaps he was listening to DFV.

Note: I'm not hating on trading GME to make tendies above, and I honestly think you should hold it if you have it now.  But when you start talking about Cohen and fundimentals, you derail the moon journey.  The moon journey is because Apes together strong, not because GME is a sound fundimental buy.  They were undervalued when DFV spotted them and started talking about them certainly.  And there is $ to be made by trading them.  But they are a squeeze, rally, momentium, IV play, not a sound fundimental investment.  They aren't Chewy.

513,MS," Here's the reason why you are wrong about GME (not necessairly AMC):

When chewy was launched, there were relatively few online competitors.  They were started in 2011, and in 2014 online pet supply sales were only 7% of a the US market (the current US market for the pet industry is \~100B).

515,AMC," with Gamestop, it's already evident what can be done; take a look at Gamefly, it's still a thing.  Gamestop needs to either be bought out by them or by them and make gaming easier.  

Digital games are the way of the future, since downloading makes things easier and takes up less hardware on one's shelf (granted, I'm one of those people who likes shelving since my and my wive's cats like tall places).  

At the same time, personalities on youtube and other sites can praise a game for all it's worth saying it's the next hot thing, when in reality, it's not.  that's why I like Gamefly, you can test it out, and if it's worth it.  For me, if I am not impressed by a game within an hour or so of play time, then I don't care about it, and it's marked off my list. 

The only way that AMC could be better is by buying a streaming service similar to what the Syfy (blastr) site has (or IMDB), and re-invent itself with streaming.  Charge less then what any of the other streaming giants are currently charging.  Currently; AMC does have a streaming app, but it's not well built.   They do that, they fix it and make it marketable, they could remain relevant for about another decade or so.  They have the movie pass, and the stubs pass; charge 20-30 dollars a year (30 for Movie pass which is a free hall pass essentially for movies, and 20 for Stubs which is the same, but you get points for movies you watch.  Re-work them as programs.  Stubs would be remain same price 20 or so for a year, you can watch movies streaming, but because it's a lower price paid, you can't watch day of movie coming out, you have to wait 24 hours and then you can watch it.  Movie Pass, charge 30 or so per year, and you can see any movie at any time, even older movies from times past or their metropolitan opera stuff they do on occasion, plus their specials like anime one night only's and things of that nature.",EmpericalNinja,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m7asag/amc_theatres_to_have_98_of_its_us_locations_open/grbbhlo/,0.022,0.907,0.072,0.9336

We know the transition is happening, but we don't know what are the exact plans.

There was a lot more quick back-and-forth style fighting, whereas now it's like the protagonist and antagonist just take turns going on the attack/defense for minutes at a time, with one side dodging/blocking everything until some attacks finally hit and then they switch sides.  And speed/quickness played a much bigger role, compared to the more recent fights where some big-ass slow super-move ends everything.

598,GME," First, thank you for your efforts at the hearing.  They are appreciated.  I believe it was your explanation of dark pools that made them finally make sense to me, but I am left with a remaining question.  When a trade happens on a dark pool, how, exactly, is ownership transferred without involving the general market?  Given that shares are not physical entities, doesn't the general market hold the authority over what shares are in which accounts?  If I agree to sell you 100 shares of GME on a dark pool for $1000, how do I report that trade has taken place, who do I report it TO?  When you go to the general market and say you want to sell those 100 shares, why wouldn't the DTCC or similar simply say ""you don't own any shares of GME""?  If we were dealing with blockchain, it would be easy to show the shares were in your wallet.  But does this just boil down to some servers on either end of the trade in a dark pool being ""trusted"" to conduct ownership transfers?  Are there requirements like settlement periods enforced?  Can there be failure to delivers on dark pools?  I understand the argument about price discover within the sub-cent arena... but how do they imagine that price discovery is, in any way, ""real"" while excluding the majority of the market?

602,IP," Hi Alexis,

Could you reiterate your thoughts on 'Gamification'? I felt they were a bit 'nanny' state-ish.

From a personal evaluation of the situation the stock market is absolutely speculation - and that's the way it should remain. I understand the need for some regulation, but what we actually need is more transparency and information - information in this day and age is the great leveler. Another leveler is constructing algorithms - but that's IP.

&#x200B;

Also: There seems to be no correlation between OTC short volume data and the NYSE reported short interest data ([https://imgur.com/a/DYKs7HK](https://imgur.com/a/DYKs7HK)) - but some portion of this is trading volume too, not just short positions.

603,GME," Hey, Alexis.

I appreciate everything you linked here.

Im interested in the fact that everyone accepted that the DTC raised their deposit limit for these “risky” stocks as a given - when even by their own wording there is an opaque and arbitrary coefficient applied to this deposit.

This goes hand in hand with the idea going a long way back that the lack of transparency for share accounting starts and ends with them.

I believe that GME hit a doomsday scenario for them mid-peak - where there were more “counterfeit” shares in circulation than actual shares.

The whole fiasco is being used as impetus to push T+1 - which helps obfuscate the issue more.

618,GME," I commented this in the GME Megathread during the hearing:

I think the main solutions for retail investors to have a level playing field against institutional investors:

1. Disclosure of all trades done by institutional investors
2. Open and free trading information from all major trading parties to the public
2. Eliminating conflicts of interest from all major trading parties (the SEC, DTCC, MMs, brokers, hedge funds, even media)
3. Banning payment for order flow
4. Systematic move by the government in the institutional level promoting and enhancing trading education
5. Implement best execution for retail investors
6. Better oversight by the SEC. All major trade violations shall not be sanctioned by just paying a fine. 

I like Kelleher's Better Markets slogan: Transparency, Accountability, Oversight.

Robinhood was not alone, but they could have done it alone is how much influence that single action had. It's worth adding the detail because it's all they needed last time.

660,OR," Theta is pretty easy to understand... and once you do you'll quit yolo'ing on stocks.

Example: Let's say I want to buy 100 shares of SNDL. SNDL is roughly 1.60 a share right now (haven't checked it this morning but that's where it closed  yesterday, right?) I could place a market order for 100 shares and pay $160. OR I could be smart about it and place a limit order for $150, knowing that the stock is going to go down _at some point_. 

But wait, isn't that the _exact same_ as selling a cash-secured put on SNDL? There are some small differences. For one thing, selling the cash secured put means I get a premium of... let's say... $20. So, I keep $150 in my account in case I get assigned on Friday, recieve an extra $20 for the put. 

Two things can now happen - SNDL doesn't drop to 150, in which case I've made 13% on my investment _in a week_ and I sell another put for the next week. OR SNDL drops below 150 and I get assigned. Boom, my net is 100 shares of SNDL, _and_ $20 in my pocket. I've effectively paid $130 for 100 shares. They may be below 1.30 at this point, or they may be at 1.49. Regardless, my cost basis is 1.30.

So now I've got 100 shares. Time to offload them at a profit. So I sell a covered call. Let's say that the share price is 1.40. So I sell a covered call at a 1.50 strike for say, a $20 premium. I've immediately got that money. Now, either the stock price goes up past 1.50, in which case I've made a total of $40 on my $150 in two weeks (25%!) and I can start the wheel again. OR the price never makes it back up to 1.50, the call expires, and I sell another one next week.

709,GME," As an eToro user myself, I can explain some of the issues I have been personally affected by:

* eToro, like Robinhood, suspending buying on GME during January.
* eToro was also known to close users' positions on declining stocks without the user's permission, even in the absence of a stop loss. This happened particularly to GME investors in January.
* eToro has been known to randomly cease allowing orders on popular stocks, most notably – you guessed it – GME.
* During periods of high demand, eToro experiences high lag. Buy orders can be executed up to 10 minutes late. As we know, a stock price can change dramatically in 10 minutes. This, coupled with the disallowing of orders, led many investors to miss opportune buying moments.
* eToro is known for regularly crashing under high demand. ""Periods of high demand"" usually coincide with periods when popular stocks are soaring. eToro went down for half a day during the January surge, and during one day in February, was [offline for almost 18 hours](https://citywire.co.uk/wealth-manager/news/etoro-increases-minimum-deposit-levels-to-stem-growth-after-18-hour-outage/a1471209). 
* There are also numerous other issues connected with registration, deposits and withdrawals. Just take a look at their recent history of technical issues [here](https://status.etoro.com/).
* Some users report eToro taking over 2 weeks to process withdrawals.

I am aware that other users have experienced an even wider range of issues than what I have described here, but I can only speak for myself.

715,GME," I think that changed, apparently buying GME (non-leverage) is buying the underlying asset (not a derivative) and it would be under your name too. I think they'll just be the custodian, however, the shares would be non-transferrable to another broker and you can't make any votes.

Just that some people think that 1000x-ing their investment means that they can't lose money... which it doesn't. The only thing that matters is the actual price and not what anyone thinks it will be. 

Based on the recommendations of traditional investment firms, GME currently does not have a buy-recommendation and therefor they have to warn their customers about that. That's it... They do not want you to sue them for making a bad decision.

It goes like this.

2.)New Console cycle release said those cheap calls were a bet worth making
3.)Cohen makes move on GME as activist investor
4.)Cohen buys large stake in company and says to board of directors “do better or i will”
5.)Board of directors listens
6.)More calls out front being purchased with large debt repayment in fall.
7.) More people start buying calls
8.) Cohen starts tweeting, becomes more involved.
9.) Options create gamma squeeze
10.) People buy a bunch of shares
11.) Options create gamma squeeze.

923,GME," I don't care what they try to do. I like the stock. I buy. I hodl. GME is extremely undervalued for an online retailer with $6.5 billion in revenue. It should be valued today at a $30 billion market cap, not $10 billion. That means today it should be worth $600 per share. With the new business model going into effect my bull thesis will put it at $1000 per share within a few years. I buy and I hodl anything beneath $900 is a discount in my mind, and I will buy with every spare change I have, fractionals or whole shares when I make extra money.

I am not a financial advice giver guy these are just my views and the long-term value I believe the stock will become.

In short, I like the stock.

If you don't have experience with options, you are likely to lose money.

The further out (date wise) you buy and the lower the strike price the better chance you have of your option retaining its value and gaining in value.

However, this is also more expensive and has lower returns compared to shorter expirations and higher strike prices.

I own Jan 2023 $300 calls. I also bought some 3/19 $250 calls when GME was near $200 EOD yesterday. I consider the latter a lottery ticket which I will most likely lose entirely.

1029,AM," u/GoodTimeNotALongOne OP pissed $1M into long-shot options hoping for another spike in share price and volatility in the next 2ish weeks. The closer these options get to expiration (4/16), the bigger the spike would need to be to make these calls profitable. Otherwise, if 4/16 comes along, these calls are worthless unless the stock is priced $800+ at expiration.

>Yeah except options are always in 100 shares quantity unless there has been an adjustment (stock split, etc). AND I paid about $29 per share per contract. So I'm in for over $1M down and the value has dropped below $400K.... I'm betting we spike up suddenly between now and 4/16. The further away from 4/16 that happens, the more profit opportunity. If I'm wrong (or too early on the trade), adios $1m.

These are call options which give me the right to buy the stock at $800 on or before 4/16. The contract in and of itself has worth because -- as it is known here -- a lottery ticket (or FD...). Normally these sell for pennies but because the market is pricing in potential market-crushing volatility, they are crazy expensive. As time goes on (closer to 4/16), if GME doesn't rocket up, the value of these lottery tickets decrease since it looks less likely GME will moon on or before 4/16. That's what this post shows -- me losing about $600K due to the fact that the stock hasn't rocketed yet.",irishdud1,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m7cu2w/guh_1m_in_calls_update_idiot_continues_to_let/greny1q/,0.044,0.886,0.07,0.2583

My Opinion why this might go titts up:

**1.**The Stock pays dividend and not less, so you can hold i if things go wrong.

&#x200B;

**2**.Its not that risky in my opinion to have UWMC in your portfolio. Srsly the Low is at 7 somewhat, so even if this crashes it wont vaporize my capital like gme will do to 99% of you guys.

&#x200B;

**3.** Just look at their fundamentals. Its pretty good. And according to yahoo finance the price target is 12,75. So basically there is plenty room to grow.

1148,OI," You really can't assume that all the OI is a short MM position.

People sell covered calls (and naked calls for that matter).  People buy vertical spreads, as well as several other multi-leg option strategies.  This leaves them with short call positions.

Also, some people buy puts.  This can leave MMs short puts, which have negative delta, which help to hedge against the short calls.

I like the stock a lot and I have a decent sized position but this analysis is just wrong.  You have no idea what the MMs books look like.  They probably have a net negative delta position on their options (causing them to hedge appropriately with shares) but I doubt it's even 10% of what you are predicting here.

As for the actual stock, I'm pretty impressed that it's holding up as the 10-year goes up.    UWMC has a lot of interest rate risk.  Last quarter, almost 80% of their volume was refinances, which tend to slow down when interest rates rise (no one is going to refi to a higher rate when they have a low rate locked in) and they had over $7B of mortgages ""at fair market value"" on their balance sheet -- those lose value as rates rise.

Mostly I like the stock because they make so much money that even if their profits. drop significantly they are still way undervalued.

Positions:  7000 shares, -100 Mar $9 puts, -100 Apr $9 puts (those are short put positions).

Today 3659 of my shares got lent out to short sellers.  Unfortunately the borrow rate has dropped significantly -- Fidelity pays me 60% of what they get and I'm only getting 1.875%, implying that Fidelity is getting 3.125%. Last week the rate was around 14%.  But if the shorts start to pile on that could start to rise again.",Keith_13,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m7plal/the_uwmc_rocket/gred4vy/,0.096,0.77,0.134,0.9246

1238,USA," this is FUD honestly. You do not know what you are talking about. Inflation has been on the rise since the fucking 80s and has not ceased one bit. CPI is bullshit, you need to look to assets and commodities to see how much of an impact inflation has truly had. Also you fail to understand that as long as Oil is traded in dollars, the US gov has a guaranteed market for dollars. For all of our debt there is a counterparty that holds it, you think those guys have any interest in seeing 100s of billions disappear? America IS too big too fail, and until the world gets it shit together to displace the foot hold the USA has on the energy sector, arms, finance, and tech  none of this will change. Letting the US default is mutually assured economic destruction for anyone who holds US gov bonds, US corp bonds, US stocks, etc etc.

does the USA have an impending economic recession? 100%

the only way it gets triggered is if countries stop buying our debt which is less likely as pretty much all other sovereign bonds have real negative interest rates, the US as least breaks even or is minutely positive.  This is why the US has been allowed to get away with this shit for so long, compared to the competition they are the best option. Until a better one comes along I do not see the US losing its ability to fuck around with its debt.

1257,MMT," Hyperinflation won't happen.

I think there are two reasons why this is the case.

**1) The money is not being spent on discretionary spending**; it's being spent on essentials and we have the ability to produce way more essentials than we actually need due to modern industrial automation, agricultural science, and cheap labor supply.

Inflation happens when demand outstrips supply.  Think about toilet paper, yeast, and Lysol at the outset of the COVID lockdowns.  All of these eventually eased up and the issue was never with the supply, but with *distribution* (e.g. there was plenty of toilet paper -- it's not like people were peeing and pooping more -- but stores and distribution centers were not used to moving the retail volume) and *packaging* (e.g. there was plenty of yeast, [but not enough consumer packaging](https://slate.com/business/2020/04/yeast-shortage-supermarkets-coronavirus.html)).

For hyperinflation, there has to be a supply/demand imbalance and the question is where anyone sees this happening.  

At a macro level, you have to ask: **is there a lack of demand for the dollar?**

Perhaps some other catastrophe could trigger hyperinflation (let's consider a scenario where US wheat, corn, and/or soy crops were somehow decimated, which would have a significant disruption on our food supply), but our ability to produce real goods far, far, far outweighs the actual demand.  There's actually waste.  [The government buys excess agriculture to keep prices stable](https://thehill.com/changing-america/sustainability/environment/492893-farmers-congress-ask-for-federal-purchase-of)!  And it's a practice that goes back to [the Great Depression and then expanded in the era of the Cold War](https://freakonomics.com/podcast/farms-race/).

**2) A lot of the money, like the 2008 bailouts, is not going to the general public** that would actually spend the money which could possibly create a supply and demand imbalance.

The money is  being concentrated and going to the already wealthy and well off.  How many yachts can they buy?  How many Manhattan penthouses can they buy?  How many Bugattis can they buy?  The way the money is being distributed doesn't lend itself to hyperinflation **because it doesn't create enough demand**; it just makes rich people less anxious.  We should be able to see the reality by now: **""trickle down"" doesn't work** because there's not enough volume of economic activity and consumption.

We see the same phenomenon in the economy as a whole: the concentration of wealth in a few companies and a few people and those people do not have the ability to create inflationary pressure.  Take Amazon and Jeff Bezos for example.  Tech companies like Microsoft, Apple, Facebook, etc.  They can't and are not willing to spend money fast enough to actually cause any sort of inflation.  Amazon has been fighting minimum wage increases and unionization.  [Big tech companies have been slapped on the wrist for colluding to keep wages down](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/06/should-tech-workers-settle-no-poach-case-for-324m-judge-has-real-doubts). If you think about the housing market in San Francisco as an example, it's clear to see that the extreme inflationary pressure caused by the wealth accumulated by these tech companies is localized and (generally) only affects the limited supply of real goods (in this case, land and real estate).

This podcast on Modern Monetary Theory is very accessible and a good listen: https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2018/09/26/651948323/episode-866-modern-monetary-theory

It reflects on the aftermath of 2008 and why we didn't see inflation at all.  Think about it: it took 200 years to accumulate the first $10T of debt [and only 9 years to accumulate the next $10T between 2008 and 2017](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/pd/histdebt/histdebt_histo5.htm).  Since Trump took office, another $7T of dollars has been created out of thin air.  ***Where's the accompanying inflation?***  

#Surely, creating $17T of debt between 2008 and 2021 should trigger massive, gargantuan, crushing amounts of inflation, right??  Tell me where it's at

More interestingly, MMT proposes the idea that we *should* create more money.  MMT proposes that rather than ""tax *then* spend"", it should be ""spend *then* tax"" to control inflation.  In other words, create as much money as necessary, and then *use taxation as the tool to take excess money supply out of the economy*.  Given that taxes and interest rates remain historically low, what economists are signaling is that the economy actually has room for even more dollars.

This followup: https://www.npr.org/2021/02/23/970595276/bond-voyage talks about how the thinking in the past was that excessive borrowing would drive up inflation...**until it didn't**.  *We've literally borrowed trillions in the last 12 months and **where's the hyperinflation??***  Here's a quote from the very end:

> GOLDSTEIN: But a handy thing about the bond market is you don't just have to listen to what people say. You can go and look at what bond traders are betting on. They're not always right. Remember when **Bill Gross** sold all his Treasurys back in 2011? But their job is to bet money and make a profit, not to go on CNBC or to advance some political agenda. And **what bond traders are betting on now is that for years to come, inflation and interest rates will stay low. They're betting that this is just the way the world works now.**

My personal conclusion (not an economist) is that our ability to produce real goods far outweighs the available supply of money in the market.  This is due to a number of factors which includes:

* Significant advances in automation and production
* Income inequality
* Inequitable tax structure
* A minimum wage and median income that has stagnated for decades
* Rising costs of services (e.g. healthcare, health insurance) which has the effect of pushing real income down
* Rising cost of housing
* Rising cost of education
* Rising consolidation leading to less market competition and more downward income pressure on most households.  My cell phone and Internet bill is the same today as it was 10 years ago.

Hyperinflation won't happen with this pitiful amount of money injected into the economy.  It would have to be bigger and distributed differently to affect inflation in any meaningful way. [There's some thought that *deflation* across the broader economy is the actual problem we are facing](https://www.ft.com/content/bdd9a68e-848b-11ea-b872-8db45d5f6714) as a result of the concentration of wealth.

The other big piece of it is that there is no real alternative to the USD as global reserve currency and until there is, USD will always be in demand (but this is a much more complex topic).",c-digs,141,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m7nu0d/do_americans_realise_the_deep_shit_they_are_in/grd475u/,0.073,0.84,0.087,0.9513

Edit: I don’t necessarily agree with this view point, I was just explaining what I think people’s argument is. Personally I don’t think to will stay above $200 long term, but hey it might.

1521,GME," Short squeezes and gamma squeezes often occur in tandem but are fundamentally different phenomena. In short:

Short squeezes are when an individual or groups of individual are short a stock, and the price rises enough such that they must cover in order to contain losses. The covering process can drive the price up in the process.

A gamma squeeze happens when a stock rises enough such that the net delta of call options and put options rises to the point where the market maker who wrote these option contracts must purchase the underlying security to maintain delta neutrality. The process of purchasing the underlying trigger a virtuous cycle of (1. Increasing stock price -> 2. increasing net delta -> 3. MM must purchase more as hedge which -> goto 1)

1609,FB," Oh no I am not, what can I show you to change your mind about both the effectiveness of HCQ, and the CV19 test numbers being wildly inflated? 

Let's try this, allow me to quote myself

""I really wish the US would enforce the 30 Ct threshold for positive cases and reporting and stop using anything over 30 because those numbers are not useful metrics (per CDC themselves) for reporting nor public policy. We'd have a LOT less cases, by a factor of 10x less because those people who tested positive over 30 do not have a live virus and the remnants of any leftover virus are not transmittable.

edit: for the person who downvoted me without reason:

""90% of the CV tests were not indicative of an active illness (picking up viral debris incapable of causing infection or being transmitted because the cycle threshold (Ct) of the PCR testing amplified the sample too many times)

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/29/health/coronavirus-testing.html

Labs in the United States were using a Ct of 37-40, and as of Dec, they are going as high as 40. ""The Times report noted that the CDC’s own data suggested the PCR did not detect live virus over a Ct of 33""

https://academic.oup.com/crawlprevention/governor?content=%2fcid%2fadvance-article%2fdoi%2f10.1093%2fcid%2fciaa1491%2f5912603

On September 28, 2020, a study published in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases from Jaafar et al. had asserted, based on patient labs and clinical data involving nearly 4,000 patients, that a Ct of 30 was appropriate for making public policy. An update to the CDC instructions for PCR testing from December 1, 2020, still uses a Ct of 40.

Yet last I read, we are still testing over the max threshold, and 30 cycles are enough to get useful data.""

and 

""Database of all HCQ COVID-19 studies. 270 studies, 198 peer reviewed, 219 comparing treatment and control groups. ""

https://hcqmeta.com/hcq-meta.pdf

https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.08.21253121v1.full.pdf

https://ijmedph.org/article/729#undefined


Bottom line: HCQ works and has worked all along, so much so, that the jerks at FB had to withdraw their banning of people talking about it. Reported CV19 positive tests unless they are run to a max of 30 cycles only, are delivering false positives and yet our government is still creating public policy using over 30. 

Imagine taking a test, learning you are positive then coming to find out they used the Ct of 40. So you actually had no live virus and nothing in your system could be transmitted. Yet you're quarantined and you are now another number. Hell, you could be many numbers if tested again and prove to be ""positive"". Now wonder how many of those positive tests are actually positive.",Posts_as_Slick_Rick,-2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m7dtaz/amc_plans_to_be_almost_fully_reopened_friday/grctlcs/,0.052,0.862,0.086,0.9501

1670,HST," my math here might be flawed, so correct me if I'm wrong 

&#x200B;

For example the ishares russel 1000 fund has 46bn in assets. 

Sure, UWMC wont be really big player there, but with a market cap of 16bn I compare it to HST with a market cap of 15bn. the Ishares holds about 30mil in shares of HST, if I take the cash number -> that's about 3mil shares if we take a share price of 10$

Now ishares isn't the only russel 1000 index. If they were clever they bought in prior, but I doubt the threw 30mil cash directly at the announcement.

&#x200B;

That leads to the conclusion, index funds like the ishares fund need to buy tons of shares, especially at this low float this will go crazy. They will propably buy in slowly, or have already begun in the weeks before, because they will hold those shares. Thus share price need to go up, because ishares russel fond can't just by 3mil shares of the float and hold it.

1682,HST," Just wanted to wait looking into this until market closes. 

I think you may be referring to IWB Russel 1000 ETF. It has a market cap of 26bn. HST is a great approximation for calculating holding of UWMC when it gets there. Currently IWB holds $8.3m value of HST. For a corresponding value of UWMC, IWB needs to buy less than 1m shares at very best. UWMC has 1.60Bn shares outstanding. Meaning even if IWB purchases all the shares on same day, which is unlikely it will still not be anywhere near to making a dent there. 

I also want to point out that Somone commented here that float is 30m. But as far as i see (based on Reuters investor report on UWMC dated 2/17/21) float is over 1.5bn too. Give me a source if you think float is much smaller.

1688,RKT, I’d present the case here that you’re rebuts is primarily focused on the impact 1000 has on UWMC or vice versa as a mover. What you aren’t considering is the intangible effect on a company simply for being included. That PR and recognition also plays a role in realizing value of a company. UWMC has been doing fantastic and is currently comparable to RKT directly as competition. So the inclusion into the 1000 validates it as a play for anyone sitting in the fence. That’s my theory.

1690,HST," Yeah... i was seeing conflicting information on float so pointed out. The only information on float i could find on schwab was from that inevestor report from reuters. 

Anyway, IWB is a better representation of what you are looking for. It also has HST. What you linked here is a subset of r1000 - etf of only growth stocks.

Anyway 1m is not massive because that wont happen in a day and stock has 30m daily volume.  Guess time will tell but i am convinced inclusion in r1000 is not going to be a reason for pop with a market cap of 16b.

Do the DTCC deposit requirements change based on the volatility of the stock purchased?  Would the purchase of $1000 of GME require a higher deposit amount than a $1000 purchase of MSFT?

If they are the same, then why would Robinhood stop trading on GME vs stopping trading on all stocks?

1775,GDP," The ""cost"" of federal student loan is not what you'd typically imagine. Student debt is already out the door, the university long ago cashed that check. The federal government simply estimates how much of it will be **recovered** \-- and these estimates are frequently wrong and need to be revised. In the Trump administration, due to the federal student loan payment suspension, the estimates were off by [tens of billions of dollars](https://www2.ed.gov/about/reports/annual/2020report/fsa-report.pdf?source=email) (see page 203). So to talk about the ""cost"" isn't really the same when you are talking about federal student debt.

Student debt is the second largest source of consumer debt (second only to mortgages). Yet 4 out of every $5 of federal student debt is held by the government.

Consider this: new data ([see this report](https://www.nclc.org/uncategorized/issue-brief-education-departments-decades-old-debt-trap-how-the-mismanagement-of-income-driven-repayment-locked-millions-in-debt.html)) shows that there are approximately two million federal student loan borrowers have been in repayment for more than 20 years. Twenty years of paying down student debt that you accumulated to try and pursue higher education, which is available for free in many non-U.S. countries. Many borrowers, and a growing number of older borrowers, have benefits like Social Security or the EITC or their tax refunds **seized** by the government because they are in default on their loans.

Consider also: because of the deep racial wealth gap in the U.S., Black and Brown student loan borrowers have less family wealth to rely on, and thus have disproportionately high student debt loads. There is a great recent [Brookings paper](https://www.brookings.edu/essay/student-debt-cancellation-should-consider-wealth-not-income/) that dives into this at length. One of the things they found was that of households with student debt, 52% of Black households have zero or negative net worth, compared with 32% of non-Black households. The racial disparities in student debt are stark.

Congress gave the Education Department the authority to cancel student loan debt in a law called the Higher Education Act. The Trump administration used this authority **three separate times** last year, to enact the first suspension on federal student loan payments, to extend it in August, and to extend it one more time in December. It was cancellation because (1) they cancelled the interest on the debt; and (2) the non-payments were counted toward the two debt forgiveness programs that *already* exist: Public Service Loan Forgiveness, and cancellation through Income-Driven Repayment.

Finally: cancelling student debt would help everyone -- even people without it! Because it would boost the economy for everyone, whether they have debt or not. There is a lengthy report by the Levy Institute I would encourage you to read which documents these benefits. The study (which was done by Scott Fullwiler, Stephanie Kelton, Catherine Ruetschlin, and Marshall Steinbaum) [estimated](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/canceling-14-trillion-in-student-debt-could-have-major-benefits-for-the-economy-2018-02-07)  that student debt cancellation would boost GDP by up to $108 billion a  year, and add up to 1.5 million jobs per year, over a ten year period. (full report [here](http://www.levyinstitute.org/pubs/rpr_2_6.pdf)).

1781,MA," I dont agree with it. The low supply doesn't increase demand, with the higher price AND trade volume, the demand must also been going up, simple ECON101. 

I been following sale centre in my area, their sale centre was never fully closed during covid, however their sale number was up more than 500% since the end of the year compares to a year before, ended up sold out all of their inventory.

Developers currently are low in inventory, also a lot of development project been delayed during covid. The supply of new home is very low right now which could transfer to the 2nd hand market soon. 

Demand side of housing are very strong, due the the low interest rate and increase of wealth + lower than ave supply, supply will not recover to post-pandemic in short term, due to low inventory of developers.

I watched yesterday as shorts did everything they could to push this down. You can read my daily analysis in another comment, but shorts have literally been selling everything and this fucking long WONT BUDGE. 230k sell order? Sure. Mr. Sun Tzu bought it and then pushed the price up.

Average 1min volume when this happened was 30k shares....

The 17.5 calls are NOT hedged, let alone the 20s or further up. At 17 the shorts should start burning and we are NOT far away from that.

A quick hard push in the morning and our entire daily volume will have to be hedged... Let that sink in...

If you're looking for an early entry this thing tends to crash at open then fucking moon. Where that moon ends is going to depend on how far we get into the 16s. A move into 17 will trigger hedging that will light the fucking rocket.

Honestly 15c are cheap as shit for the money they can return.

Positions: 200 3/19 15c And some other random shit.

Ortex data just dropped with estimated SI and holy dear jesus did shorts work hard to keep the price down yesterday. [https://imgur.com/a/ogGIffN](https://imgur.com/a/ogGIffN)

3/16 SI: 9.9mil

3/17 SI: 10.5mil

3/18 SI: 12.5mil

That means that TWO MILLION SHARES were shorted between 15 and 16 yesterday. A bunch of those shorts are already in the red, and if we solidly push above 16 we're looking at an easy million in losses for shorts.

Before ya'll get too excited I'd like to remind everyone that Ortex data is an estimate. However this is still the biggest single day SI increase since end of January, and SI has never been higher. The price points at which they sold these shares mean they will be easy to burn.

Gamma ramp is also still building. 3k more OI on the 15c and 17.5c, and 6k more on the 20c.

What to watch for this morning:

I'm interested to see where we actually open. Historically the market being down hasn't been bad for us, and much like gamestop when the rest of the short's portfolio is down they have to close SI which turns us green.

Watch [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GOEV](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GOEV)

They usually borrow 1.7mil shares in the morning (I'm actually still not sure what they do with these. It might be to slow momentum but I'm unsure) and return them by \~10:30. However 200k of the available shares weren't returned yesterday at all...

10:30am Edit: ---------------------------------

Holy shit the fighting going on is more than we've seen in a long time. Shorts are protecting $16 and longs are keeping it above the SMA.

CMF has been falling on rising price action which is usually an indicator of a reversal or a pop when CMF turns back up.

Shorts do NOT want to lose the $16 line. Wonder why they're protecting it so much?

Usually by this point most shares have been returned to IB. They borrowed 1.67mil share per normal at 9:00am but have only returned 770k of them by 10:15. This abnormal, and I'm interested to see what happens.

11:05am Edit: ---------------------------

Shares from IB still haven't been returned and we just had a huge volume tick over the $16 line. Next target is 16.63. Shorts will probably look to recapture $16.

Shorts are officially bleeding money from the 2mil SI spent yesterday and possibly the 1mil borrowed from IB.

1:10pm: ------------------------------------------------

Yeah. Those 900k shares borrowed from IB look like they've been spent. What will you use tomorrow shorts?

We just had a hard bounce off our afternoon drop. Shot right through SMA, VWAP, then turned and bounced again off VWAP.

This is super bullish for this afternoon (and afternoons are typically a cringe fest as the price slowly drops). I'm watching for us to recapture $16 which would signal that this afternoon is primed for some gains.

3:45:------------------------------------------------------------

Well. Right now we're looking more like cardboard box than valhalla! The entire market has been taking a dump, though we are getting some increased buy action going on right now.

I haven't actually changed my positions, which may have been a bad idea but... Here we are!

I have zero idea what is going to happen from here. I'd like for us to end green, and if we can recapture $16 that would be hugely bullish (though I don't think that'd happen)

1901,TA," My only thoughts on this TA is that .5 is not a real fib retracement level. The indicator can be used but what we see when we do is a bearish zig zag pattern above the .5 fib. 

In my opinion and analysis of this chart we may see a continued retracement to the .618 fib at 160 before a reversal. 

Although, I do slightly agree with your bullish thesis as there is a tiny bullish pattern forming (higher lows) just after the .5 bounce.

So I won't be suprise if he tries to trigger the squeeze to make his clients happy and fk the shorts at the same time (sorry for my english doing my best)",bjergismydadddy,6,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m7ya85/why_i_think_gme_is_still_bullish_and_going_to_moon/grekh5x/,0.0,0.889,0.111,0.905

If the squeeze happens, it will happen next week, when dividend cash is received on 3/23. Same option chain run up, but with a whole lot of shares being purchased with dividend cash.

That's why RKT has had nothing for volume the past couple of days. Stop trying to pump 3/19 to get a catalyst for your options.",dbcfd,17,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m7s1os/rkt_319_gains_if_shares_are_bought/grd4djv/,0.038,0.925,0.038,0.0

The previous squeeze also happened on a weekly expiration with low open interest. You need open interest chains, that hopefully have uncovered calls. There is no indication that 3/19 or 3/26 are not hedged. 

Next week, buying calls will amplify share purchases from dividend. There's nothing amplifying call purchases this week.

I'm not a financial advisor snd this is my opinion after I ate 3 different colored crayons.
