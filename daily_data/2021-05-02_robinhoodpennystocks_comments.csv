8,MOS," What they said. I don‚Äôt have any penny stock picks right now though.

More than just penny stocks, Pick a few good companies, setup auto invest so you continue to buy more shares while you‚Äôre in training. Don‚Äôt blow your money once you get out of basic and into your MOS training. Keep auto transfer on, best way to force yourself to save.

Hell don‚Äôt blow your money once your done with your training and with your unit. Don‚Äôt go off buying the new hot car. Consider buying it certified use, 2-3 years old with more miles.",gomads1,18,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/n3a898/basic_training/gwolslu/,0.043,0.838,0.119,0.8016

16,SOS," All of this advice! I didn‚Äôt serve (type 1 diabetic) but was a military brat. My mom bartended on base and saved her money while stationed overseas. Bought a nice used car and it allowed her to have savings while finishing up her degree while raising me when she got out of the Air Force. But for stock advice, you are young so put half of what you planned to invest in a safe boomer stock and the other half in a high risk, high reward stock.

17,MVIS," WSB‚Äôs latest darling is not a ‚Äúgood boomer stock‚Äù, MVIS has been and could continue to be really volatile.  They could get bought out, or they could go right back to $1.50 if the rumors don‚Äôt pan out, not a good ‚Äúset and forget‚Äù candidate.

18,MVIS," ‚ÄúRumors‚Äù was referring to the likelihood of a buyout, it‚Äôs nothing but speculation as far as I‚Äôve read.  You could flip the 20 year journey around, this is a company that hasn‚Äôt turned a profit for 20 years and may never if something goes wrong.  I like the stock, I too am impressed with their tech, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm in and that‚Äôs why I didn‚Äôt sell during last week‚Äôs dump, but it‚Äôs far from a sure thing.  I‚Äôm not trying to rip on you or anyone, just offering another perspective.

However one feels about MVIS, I don‚Äôt think you can call it a ‚Äúboomer‚Äù stock.  MVIS is a compelling gamble, boomer advice is ‚Äúdollar cost average SPY and don‚Äôt look at it‚Äù.",hatekillpuke,0,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/n3a898/basic_training/gwphm3k/,0.058,0.813,0.128,0.8402
19,IMO," Perhaps it‚Äôs a gamble to you. And for what it‚Äôs worth i am not the most brilliant bulb. 

If this was a science fair, this science project is a successful one. The creator already has sensors in Microsoft‚Äôs headset. There are former employees from google and Ford sitting on the board. The yields from this science project has the best yields so far. The industry is an established one and will make headway at autonomous tech one way or another. 20 years ago microvision was in a niche market in a world that wasn‚Äôt ready for the future. It is a gamble in some regard as is any tech play but the context of the present industry and this science project isn‚Äôt just stars being aligned. Autonomous navigation is going to happen and be ready in a few years and Mvis is well positioned. Sure it‚Äôs not numerically ‚Äòstable‚Äô but the growth chart doesn‚Äôt go anywhere but up over time. Not necessarily anytime soon but It‚Äôs and easy set and forget. IMO it‚Äôs just a matter of how much your belief, judgement, and experience will allow you to exercise. My positions start from 18.74$ to 10.45 beginning from earlier this year. Little over 1000 shares and I held during the 30$ peak because I‚Äôd rather save in taxes sooner than later but that‚Äôs just a judgement calll in case of x. 

Edit: forgot to mention that if you know what catalysts are lined up, just easy to be practical about the outlook on growth. Obviously nothing is guaranteed as you are well warning op, I‚Äôm severely optimistic",SeesawNo5442,1,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/n3a898/basic_training/gwplcvq/,0.039,0.789,0.172,0.9873
