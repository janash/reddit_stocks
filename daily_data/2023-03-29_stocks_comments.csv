1,GTE," Q: if I held $100 worth of NYNEX in june 1996, and the current value of  VZ (verizion) is $38.38 a share, how much is that NYNEX worth today (March 2023)  


A:In June 1996, NYNEX was acquired by Bell Atlantic Corporation and merged to form Verizon Communications Inc. So, if you held $100 worth of NYNEX in June 1996, then your investment would have been converted into Bell Atlantic Corporation shares and subsequently to Verizon Communications Inc. shares.  
Assuming that you invested the entire $100 in NYNEX in June 1996, and NYNEX was trading at $31.625 per share at that time, then you would have purchased approximately 3.16 shares of NYNEX.  
When NYNEX was merged with Bell Atlantic Corporation, each NYNEX share was converted into 0.768 shares of Bell Atlantic Corporation. Therefore, your 3.16 shares of NYNEX would have been converted into approximately 2.42 shares of Bell Atlantic Corporation.  
Finally, when Bell Atlantic Corporation merged with GTE Corporation in June 2000 to form Verizon Communications Inc., each share of Bell Atlantic Corporation was converted into 1.22 shares of Verizon Communications Inc. Therefore, your 2.42 shares of Bell Atlantic Corporation would have been converted into approximately 2.95 shares of Verizon Communications Inc.  
As of March 29, 2023, Verizon Communications Inc. is trading at $38.38 per share. Therefore, your investment of $100 in NYNEX in June 1996 would be worth approximately $113.09 today, which is calculated as follows:  
$100 ÷ $31.625 per share = 3.16 shares of NYNEX  
3.16 shares of NYNEX × 0.768 shares of Bell Atlantic Corporation per share of NYNEX = 2.42 shares of Bell Atlantic Corporation  
2.42 shares of Bell Atlantic Corporation × 1.22 shares of Verizon Communications Inc. per share of Bell Atlantic Corporation = 2.95 shares of Verizon Communications Inc.  
2.95 shares of Verizon Communications Inc. × $38.38 per share = $113.09",TechGjod,16,/r/stocks/comments/125pbqe/found_a_paper_stock_certificate_while_cleaning_is/je5vql9/,0.0,0.798,0.202,0.9943

3,COST," That's not right.  The COST BASIS for $100 in shares would be $11.79.  To find the current value, you'd need to calculate out all the splits and mergers to determine how many shares you have now.  

For the record, on  12/30/1983, NYNEX closed at $15.375/share, which makes its CURRENT cost basis $2.21 for a single share of VZ.  The actual value of the share is whatever the current share price is times the number of shares you wound up with.  


I did this calculation for Apple once.  The cost basis for a single share of apple stock bought at the time of their 1980 IPO for $22 is 10cents, and that one share is now 224 shares, worth at yesterday's close over $35,313.",WhiskyEchoTango,442,/r/stocks/comments/125pbqe/found_a_paper_stock_certificate_while_cleaning_is/je5spc7/,0.0,0.794,0.206,0.9674

14,ALL," > The Conference Board measure is from literally yesterday.

Up from what for 7 months in a row? The low from last year? Are you looking at the graph? It's been going up and down for the last year or so. The data from Yahoo also shows a similar story. I'm not sure where you're getting ""confidence up for the 7th month in a row"" from. Look at the graph from either of these sources and show me where there's a consistent uptrend from the previous measurement. It literally does not exist.

> You can make up negative data which doesn't exist yet if you want

I'm not making up negative data lmao. See [this](https://imgur.com/M0VQknU) graph? This is the graph yahoo is using. It can be found [here](https://www.investing.com/economic-calendar/michigan-consumer-sentiment-320?utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=yahoo_finance). The Yahoo article is from Mid January. See how the graph increases since December, but increases in March? See how the [data that makes up the chart](https://imgur.com/JLpoPxR) only shows increases since November? Now... what is 7 months ago.... March, February, January, December, November, October... So what you're saying is, 100% of the sentiment polls from ALL of these months are increasing??

And for the confidence board data, you can see the [graph](https://imgur.com/TMEljrn) squiggles when it gets to 2023. There is no reason for it to squiggle if it's constantly improving right? But here, the graph shows it decreases then increases again, then decreases again. In other cases where this trend is true, the decrease and increase are similar magnitudes, but in this case, the increase is MUCH LESS than previous increases along this pattern. There is an increase that was posted today on this link, however, it's a slight increase after a somewhat sharp decrease. [Here's the article for February](https://www.conference-board.org/topics/consumer-confidence/press/CCI-Feb-2023) showing that it DECLINED.

Inflation is driven by rising prices which CAN be driven by spending.

It can also be driven by dwindling supply

It can be caused by unchecked cartelization artificially increasong prices

It can be caused by increased production costs due to supply chain disruptions

There is no singular factor to drive inflation. This is why just raising interest doesn't reverse inflation, but going beyond inflation with rates does. It just creates such a massive deflative pressure because, by your own admittence many companies fund their operstions through lines of credit, that the pressure of that one factor will overwhelm the other factors entirely. Not just with job hiring but all growth, which is ANOTHER cause of inflation.

The fed does not care about why because THEY CANT DEAL WITH WHY. All they can do is take this ONE TOOL that they have to drive back inflation and use it. That's it. There is no magic sauce. The fed is fast but limited.

The issue cannot be solved with the fed.

The “$600-1800” stimulus checks (and it was over $10k in total if you had kids) were a small part of the overall stimulus. We also paid people $60k a year - often more than they made in their previous jobs - in enhanced unemployed benefits. There was of course also PPP. And student loan interest freeze - which is still ongoing for some unknown reason. And massive payments to states and local governments (which then used that money to stimulate at the local and state level), and dozens of other stimulus measures included in the three stimulus bills that covered in the FIVE TRILLION in stimulus.

30,BR," as a long time holder of LULU stock, i'm trimming my position significantly. 

Lulu has been hot, but the athleisure trend is slowly dying down. fashion is very circular and my current analysis is that there is a shift away from the ""stretchy"" look. sure anecdotally you might still see a lot of people in Lulu but how much of that was purchased in the last year. looking on social media (what i view as a big influence for consumer purchasing habits) the ""old money"" aesthetic is popping up more than ever. brands like Ralph Lauren, Abercrombie, BR etc. fit that look. it won't be an overnight transition but i see this as a fairly strong trend.

 next lets talk competition. it's a crowded space with a ton of other competitors such as Vuori, Rhone, Ten Thousand, etc., not to mention all of the other lower priced lower quality dupes from Amazon or Uniqlo. more players in the space means decrease in market share.

Lulu's growth strategy is focused on increasing menswear sales and increasing their international presence. my qualm with this is that as a consumer group, men just don't buy as many clothes as women, and judging by the comments below, if they do buy something quality that lasts, they won't look to replace it for years. yes, more men are entering the brand, but i'm not as bullish on this growth lever as other analysts are.

from an international perspective, Lulu is not seen as big of a status symbol as it is here. it will take time to shift that image and enter new markets. a big one could be China, as seen during the winter olympics (team Canada was wearing all Lulu), Lulu searches were up big in Chinese social media. we'll have to see if they can sustain that momentum and get the Chinese consumer to buy into the Lulu lifestyle they're selling, but I am bullish on growth in this market. 

Prediction: Short term performance will be ok, but don't see long term growth as sustainable

TLDR: shift in fashion trends might hurt Lulu's top line growth. increased competition in the athleisure space. menswear sales might not be as bullish as expected.

from an international perspective, Lulu is not seen as big of a status symbol as it is here. it will take time to shift that image and enter new markets. a big one could be China, as seen during the winter olympics (team Canada was wearing all Lulu), Lulu searches were up big in Chinese social media. we'll have to see if they can sustain that momentum and get the Chinese consumer to buy into the Lulu lifestyle they're selling, but I am bullish on growth in this market. 

Prediction: Short term performance will be ok, but don't see long term growth as sustainable

TLDR: shift in fashion trends might hurt Lulu's top line growth. increased competition in the athleisure space. menswear sales might not be as bullish as expected.

33,EIC," The East India Company. 

A group of relatively small time investors met in London ~1600, to jointly fund an expedition to the far East to directly procure oriental goods and sell them direct to the English market. Prior to this, the goods had to pass through and be taxed by the ports of the French or Dutch kingdoms, meaning the goods had high final cost in London. 

At the time, the UK was a proverbial backwater of Europe. The Dutch, French, Spanish and Portuguese kingdoms were far richer and more influential. From a global perspective, the far East, India and china particularly, was much richer and more developed than Europe. 

The first voyage, the EIC ship stumbled upon a Portuguese vessel returning to Europe with 1200 tons in goods. The EIC ship engaged in piracy, sacked the Portuguese ship, and returned to London with the booty. This first haul was so profitable, it provided huge returns for the investors. And drove significant investor interest. This set up the EIC for early growth. Growth was soon funded by the issue and broad public sale of shares. 

Over the next 250 years the EIC would grow to be the largest and most influential company in the world. Eventually amassing an enormous army of more than 200,000 soldiers, de facto ruling over the entire Indian subcontinent and beyond. The purpose of which was to monopolize the trade of all of India. At one point, EIC trade accounted for 1/4 of the English economy. 

The EIC grew so large that the power of the company threatened English democracy, and they had to be dismantled. and India taken over by the British government and administered as a colony. But britain, the country, didn't conquer India, the EIC did. 

The rise of the EIC and the volume of wealth it generated was a major factor in the rise of Britain, from a weak, small and far flung isolated island nation, to a global powerhouse. This wealth was the primary source of capital that drove Britains other expeditions and colonization of the rest of the world. The effects of this rise to power continue to shape the world today.

85,AMZN," I have a very uncommon situation. No debt, been earning well since 18 and made some lucky investments (NVDA and AMZN mainly, plus other stocks and ETFs). End of year 2021 my portfolio jumped a little above $100k a few months before I turned 23. You can imagine how 2022 went. Sold AMZN a little while before the lows, but my NVDA is staying put. I've kept investing heavily and am back up well above $100k. I loaded up on tech during 2022 but so far in 2023 I've been buying only VTI/VXUS/SCHD and probably will continue to do so unless we have a proper drop again.

I don't think $100k is a magic number for everyone. It's pretty relative to each person. I think once your investments are big enough that their return is about equal to the amount of capital you are able to invest each year, that's where the magic starts to happen. If you invest $10k a year, and your $100k returns $10k as well (10%), then that's your magic number, and each year you'll see it compound at a much more rapid pace compared to before. That's how I look at it anyway.

For me I don't think I'll really feel good about easing off the gas until at least $300k. Maybe $400k? Maybe more? It's so hard to say when it's still far in the future.",cdmpants,6,/r/stocks/comments/125tbox/at_what_age_did_it_take_you_to_have_100k_invested/je60wkj/,0.044,0.859,0.098,0.9145

98,RE," Flexibility happens from there. 

I'm still speed-running my first quarter million, or attempting to. I made it from 5k-45k in the past year. I'm hoping to hit 100k around February 2024 and a quarter million around my 32nd birthday in 2026. February 2024 I'll be 29, but I haven't done it yet and am not even halfway there, although much of the hardest work has already been done. 

A lot changed going from broke to 5k in terms of daily stress. A lot changed from 5k-45k in terms of how badly I need to work every day, week and month to preserve capital. A lot will change from 45k-100k in terms of what I'm able to do with my money, RE investment and business opportunities start to open up on a wider scale, at 250k I'm more or less on a trajectory where I hopefully have retirement sorted and am young enough that it should let me limp to retirement as long as I don't spend it down over the next 40 years. 250k is basically the number Munger was talking about at the time. That means I can do basically whatever I want for 40 years as long as it generates income and I don't spend more than I generate. After that, it's basically just a moving number that opens up a lot of opportunities as far as income generation go. If I'm interested in construction with 250k I'm limited to a few options, but if I'm interested in construction with 2.5m and I'm 45, I have a lot of different ways I can run my venture. If I want to go into manufacturing with 250k, I probably have to buy one machine and rent space, but if I have 4m at 48 I can just buy/build a small plant.",somandfeelies,1,/r/stocks/comments/125tbox/at_what_age_did_it_take_you_to_have_100k_invested/je6xy3a/,0.046,0.865,0.089,0.8381

Neither of those scenarios are good. That's why I recommended balancing dividend payouts with growth potential. 

What I called out in my previous comment is what I don't like about RC... flat stock price, revenue down substantially, and their dividend payout is all over the place (in the last 2 years its been as low as $0.10/share and as high as $0.42/share).

225,EU," >What I do question is what could back the dollar if it isn’t backed by oil? Data?

It will be backed by all the people in the US continuing to spend dollars. The Euro and Pound have traded in a fairly consistent range against the dollar for decades even though the US is the primary reserve currency. Even the Yen has been fairly range bound since the early 90's even though their economy has flatlined and debt has exploded.

If you want to do business in a developed country, you'll accept and make transactions in their currency. You might immediately convert some of it to something else, but you're still going to be transacting in that currency and creating demand for it, which will sustain its value. 

The only real threat to the dollar is a collapse of the US economy to sub 1st world status. If reserve status was what's saving the dollar, every other currency from a developed country should be continuously losing purchasing power to the dollar, when in reality there's largely been stasis because even though the US has grown a bit faster than other developed markets, the EU, England, and Japan are still huge markets that justify foreign investment.",spike_owens,4,/r/stocks/comments/1258r89/what_if_usd_loses_it_global_reserve_status/je4xs5k/,0.075,0.861,0.064,-0.7399

Then focus on what is more important to be rich.... Your education, job, income, savings, and LBYM.

Long dividend history, and I like the yield for the price. Again don't take anyone's advice, so I'd recommend going to their investor relations to listen to the last few earnings calls to familiarize yourself with the company and direction. I struggle with fully understanding the structure and projects, but trust the history and leadership so I don't get to deep into the weeds with them. 

Do the same with MVIS. It's a complex technology, but the earnings calls are a good place to start, as well as the investor relations page on their website.  In simple terms they are working on the tech for self driving cars and I love their product compared to the competition. Have produced test cars and working with OEMs to send out their products for testing, feedback, and modification.

When I said to compare, having a share of QQQ and XLK (not XLX) just lets you see how they do daily and over time compared to your portfolio.  Of course you can do that without one share just looking online, but I think you will find that if you like tech, you won't need SPY and the others (except the KO/VZ part) if you held XSD/XLK/QQQ.  If you held those three as a base, you could then get heavier with AAPL or NVDA or whatever, especially what might make sense to be heavier with temporarily.

XSD is the best performing ETF for the past ten years, and the second best non-leveraged one for the past five years.
