36,PLTR," Dude I feel you, I bought in at $33. But arguably, in hindsight this correction is perfectly rational. 

In previous quarters, the whole growth market priced in years of revenue growth across competing companies to perfection, while opportunity cost (yields on bonds) was close to zero, hence at minimal discount rates. 

Now, the market is realizing that not all companies can grow at 100% 10 years straight. The hype has been dashed. Furthermore, discount rates are rising, meaning lack of foreseeable dividends becomes costlier for the investor. 

Consequently, as the hype has faded, the market is now pricing in the actual risk of investing in growth stocks. It didn't do that back in Jan.

As far as what they did with the mustang I think it was a good move. It's an iconic brand and it's been around for decades.

This is not always true. If you are in the broader market, yes, it will in all likelihood recover. If you are in individual names, nope, no guarantee. 

If you bought General Motors in 1980, that stock is worth nothing today. Nothing. It went bankrupt. Sure, you pulled out some dividends, but the principal is toast. Buying GM in 1980 was sound, sage advice. 

If you bought Intel in the summer of 2000 when it was the darling you are still down. JDSU bagholders are out a lot as well. I cannot state how much people loved JDSU back in the day. 

I personally went ballz deep in Citigroup, AIG and Lehman when they were falling knives. LEH is gone and C and AIG did reverse splits and are worth maybe 20% of what I paid for them in 2007 or 2008.

224,ENPH," Don't keep buying garbage.

Right now there are things that look like they are on sale, but they're not on sale. They're still market priced or better.

You need to let the momentum drain out before getting back into high volatility beta stocks.

I know you can't time the market, but you can use fundamental analysis to assess whats a good entry point. The price change alone isn't justification enough.

Look at ENPH. Its 50% off from its peak in February. Is that still considered a deal? Even at its current price it has a P/S of 18 and a P/E of 192. Are you willing to pay that multiple?",radarbot,12,/r/stocks/comments/n9u0o7/with_the_market_being_mostly_red_today_what_you/gxq2n01/,0.036,0.878,0.086,0.7724

227,ENPH," SQ is trading at a PS ratio of 8, looking at its historical ps ratio in the last 3 years it probably won’t go below 6 at the least but I think 8 is a great deal considering it was higher in parts of 2018, 2019 and a lot of 2020. It had the same PS ratio in February of 2020 and it’s stock price is more than doubled since then. Added more when it dipped below 210 and I bought a share of ENPH when it dipped below 110. Both can technically drop more but I’m holding both long term and they’ll be higher in 6 months to a years time if they did drop more

Edit: for reference PYPL is valued at a PS ratio of 12 in comparison to SQ, and SQ is growing much faster

Also in the last quarter PYPL only made 1 billion more in revenue than SQ (6B vs 5B) and it’s market cap is almost 3x the size of SQ’s

350,STAY," I’m a huge rookie but I’ve finally hit green because of a change in philosophy I made....

Try to look for stocks that people aren’t talking about as much, or there is a big lull in the conversation.  Pick the a sector that’s growing or not hot yet.  Don’t pick the ones the at are already hot - they have a lot to lose and are probably way overvalued.

While I’m not making huge gains, I’m finding more success by buying stocks on red days.  Then the green days arrive and everybody is suddenly talking about and buying your stock, you’ll feel warm and fuzzy being ahead, and you sell in the middle of the hype, not at the end.  Don’t get greedy.

So in summary - try to get ahead of the hype, buy quieter, non-meme stocks and wait a few weeks.  Don’t think “oh this stock is doing amazing, I want to buy some ASAP because I have fomo.  And all these other Redditors are buying it so it MUST be good.  Even if I lose at least I can commiserate with them.”  STOP.

I’m no expert, totally clueless, not a professional whatsoever, but guys, stop buying the top 10 most popular meme stocks that have been green for weeks or months and then acting surprised when they tank 🤷‍♂️

Also, you can’t compare GM and Tesla. GM is made up of 4 different brands, and they sell cars at vastly different price points. Cadillac is the only brand from GM that really competes with Tesla based on price until Tesla starts selling that 25k model.

(although there are some things that I've seen recently that makes me wonder if that last leg before the Naz as a whole sold off might have had a lot to do with a gamma squeeze)

Edit: I know there is more than just TSLA, but I've heard at times before that the EV market often follows TSLA.

And since about early March or so, we've actually been doing more domestic repos I believe (most of it for a while was just Japan helping us I believe). It hasn't been less, but when we started pumping more again, it was already too late for EV stocks (and fun, speculative names) as they had already been severely damaged technicals wise.",95Daphne,1,/r/stocks/comments/n9zmz4/why_did_many_stocks_begin_their_declines_in/gxqxfvh/,0.092,0.825,0.083,-0.6364
448,IBKR," >1. if s1 is true, then how did warren buffett get so wealthy in one lifetime?

Because Warren Buffet started very early and people kept giving him money to manage it for them. You can be just as wealthy, if not more, than Warren Buffet. By the way, [Buffet has not beaten the market.](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3197185) he simply uses cheap leverage from his insurance business and invests in Large-cap value firms which statistically have the lowest drawdowns during recessions. 

>if s1 is true, wouldn't that imply anyone could become the best brokerage on earth just by investing all their clients' money in vtsax?

Yup. It's called Vanguard and it is quite popular. To be fair,  Vanguard doesn't invest the money for you. They just give you the tools to make that decision yourself.

>there are multiple broad market index funds and they don't all have exactly the same returns, implying someone could make a new fund that has better returns, which contradicts s1.

What broad market index funds are you referring to? There is only one broad market index fund and that is VT/VTWAX. Even VT/VTWAX is not as broad as you might think because it excludes microcaps and Frontier markets. Things like VTI, VXUS, and VOO are very broad by this subreddit's standards but they are not broad enough for academic purposes.

>why does anyone invest in real estate (other than for shelter)?

Dunning-Kruger effect and bias. Everyone believes they are some kind of investing genius who can outsmart the market (other people). To be fair, you can't live in your stocks but you already mentioned a reason other than shelter.

469,VG," > I don’t think it’s a waste or joke of a company, rich people spend tons or money on climbing Mount Everest

It is at least a quarter of a million for 6 minutes in 0g. We can all speculate if there is enough demand for it, I personally doubt it.

They need to not only prove there is a big enough market to justify their current 4 B market cap. They also have to prove they can launch in the volume AND margins necessary to do so. If they have such huge delays on ""maintenance issues"" on a test flight and keep delaying it, nobody should have any confidence whatsoever that they can deliver there.

In terms of competition, Blue Origin is poised to beat them to the suborbital game. SpaceX will do affordable orbital space tourism as soon as they get Starship going and human certified (could take years). Rich are more likely to spend much more money on much longer orbital experiences than 5 minute joyrides.

Once orbital tourism gets in the same ballpark, VG is done as a company. Their architecture can't switch to orbital easily, nor is it easy to scale to larger rockets.",FinndBors,3,/r/stocks/comments/na46xs/what_is_your_opinion_of_virgin_galactic_spce/gxrmld0/,0.045,0.851,0.104,0.8999

472,UNP," Railroads are capital intensive businesses which have to borrow lot of money upfront for laying railroads, locomotives, wagons etc and then they get paid slowly over the years for the capital invested, when these railroads are used.

As a result they have higher debt to equity ratios. UNP currently has debt of $26B for a book value equity of $16B.

Interest rates increases can thus affect in two ways.
1. New borrowings will be costlier for any new Capex
