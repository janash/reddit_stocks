61,GME," Going to be honest, I'm a little perplexed as to why GME is still such a huge focus for /r/wallstreetbets. 

After the hedge funds got outplayed back in January (which was great to see), they all abandoned GME and haven't touched it since. Almost certainly they have moved on and are now wrecking other vulnerable companies, just like what they tried to do to GME.

If /r/wallstreetbets doesn't adapt to the hedge funds switching targets, and just memes about GME for months (you can still hold and GME will be safe), then what really has been achieved in the grand scheme of things? Personally I think it would be incredibly unfortunate if /r/wallstreetbets won a significant battle, then forgot to win the war. 

The hedge funds are probably loving that GME is still the focus, because it's now acting as the ultimate decoy and allowing the hedge funds to slip away to wreck havoc elsewhere. If that's allowed to happen, then the GME situation will have been nothing more than a momentary blip for the power elite and hedge funds.",sbowesuk,25,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n6zbc0/its_coming_people/gxa8a2z/,0.111,0.744,0.145,0.791

150,GME," This doesn't look like perjury to me, but it could be depending on the timeline of events.

Vlad restricted trading to prevent being margin called. The DTCC/SEC waived the deposit requirements for Robinhood, but to what degree I'm not sure. The requirement was waived for the $2.2 billion capital requirement but would it have been waived if GME hit $1000 per share? Maybe, maybe not. 

In order to prove perjury you'd have to provide a timeline of events on when the margin call was to take effect, when Robinhood restricted trading, and when the capital requirement was waived. 

Because let's say you were going to be margin called (according to the rules), you restrict trading to cap losses, and then the capital requirement was waived at end of day before a normal margin call would have taken effect. I don't think that would be perjury because there's no way you would have known the capital requirement waiver was going to take effect. You were preparing for the margin call, then the waiver came in last minute.

But if Robinhood was in contact with the DTCC, was aware of the capital requirement waiver well enough in advance to not restrict trading, but restricted trading anyway, then there's a case there potentially.",kidcrumb,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n6i28o/did_vlad_do_a_perjury/gx9ohra/,0.117,0.82,0.062,-0.9304

Well excuse the fuck out of me. I had no idea AMC’s turnaround was due to their fundamental, strategic, and innovative changes to their business. After a year of essentially $0 revenue in a decaying industry, halting of new film recordings, and a lack of an updated business model. Yeah Aron, you and your board certainly outdid yourself. AMC is on the up and up because AMC is an astonishing business. 

You paid someone pennies to file forms to issue new shares and cash in off the backs of the everyday degenerates that kept your business afloat. You’ll acknowledge the sub, but continue to praise yourself.

Being honest, if this guy remains at the helm, I don’t actually like the stock. There’s money to be made buying dips and selling on upswings, but if I’m short on AMC I’m waiting that shit out.

With 4 of the top 10 highest grossing (dumb figure to track with inflation and all) and they STILL DIDN'T MAKE MONEY. I do agree with your comment about movie theaters not dying because the studios need them. But, they definitely aren't growing. The more money that Netflix/Amazon/Disney put into their platform the less movies need to go to theaters.

"" You think A-list actors and directors want their movies to go straight to Netflix?"" I think there is ample evidence that this is true. How many movies have been release that are just on the streaming services? The Rock is the biggest star and he has a couple.

Gal Gadot signed a contract before she knew WW84 was going to streaming. If you think that the lawyers won't change the contracts for steaming you are dumb. The contracts for all of this stuff will change drastically based on where the film is going.

Answer this, compared to 5 years ago are there more movies going to streaming? That right there cuts down AMC's cut from the total pie. I think that only blockbusters will go to theaters and that is just a dick measuring contest between the movie studios. If you look at Disney, they added the ""premium"" part to Disney+ in order to catch pay-per-view money on their first run movies.

228,AMC," Stop deleting your comments.

Average cost at $10? That is tough. Good luck. I am sure in 5 years you might be able to make a profit and chase some other meme stock where you buy way too high and try and justify after.

Regarding Disney, have you noticed how they are releasing Black Widow? That went from a blockbuster to a partial streaming release. That is revenue AMC will never see that they would have in the past (try and keep this in your mind when you think AMC will raise revenue). How many shows has Marvel/Disney released that could have been a movie? Wandavision, Falcon, Loki, etc. That is more lost revenue.

I agree that actors and other people trying to get a cut of the pie want the big movie release because they know how to count it. But, if you think Disney isn't going to keep releasing movies on both platforms you are crazy. I would assume you have seen all the animated movies going straight to Disney instead of a theater. More lost revenue.

You always comment about not knowing anything but list 1 thing you have written that isn't a headline. Do you know their current rent requirements? Do you know their current loan payments? Do you know the interest rates or principal? Basically, do you know anything about the company?

""John M Griffen and Alex Priest are, respectively, a prominent professor of finance and a Ph.D. candidate at the McCombs School of Business at the University of Texas at Austin. In a [study](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3671162) released last November, they sampled almost 40,000 CMBS loans with a market capitalization of $650 billion underwritten from the beginning of 2013 to the end of 2019.

“Overall,” they write, “actual net operating income falls short of underwritten income by 5% or more in 28% of loans.” This was just the average, however: Some originators — including an unusual company called Ladder Capital as well as the Swiss bank UBS, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, and Morgan Stanley — were significantly worse, “having more than 35% of their loans exhibiting 5% or greater income overstatement.”

UT Study referenced: [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract\_id=3671162](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3671162)

TLDR: The Dollar General that you go to while your wife is with her boyfriend is getting a loan on overstated operating income, when it goes under it's put back in another CMBS security with a slightly different address.  


""Flynn also alleges in the complaint that changes in names and addresses when loans are moved out of old trusts and into new ones are not an accident but suggestive of deliberate obfuscation. “The correlation of name and address changes with inflated numbers,” he says, “is something like 95 percent.”""

253,VTOL," This probably counts as confirmation bias for me. I’ve had a long term bear view of commercial real estate without factoring in systemic fraud, based upon electrification of transportation. Catalysts. In order of likely occurence:

1. Work from home. Well addressed by everyone already, and already underway.
2. Electric cars leading to a glut of prime corner real estate. Well over 90% of charging is done at home. The grid is everywhere. Gas stations will not survive. They are expensive sites to repurpose due to possible ground contamination, but again these are high traffic, valuable corners. (I usually lump car dealerships in here too).
3. When autonomy is solved and transportation as a service becomes the norm parking lots will be huge empty wastelands of easily repurposed square footage. There are 5 parking spots for each car in this country because our cars are parked north of 95% of the day. If car usage of even just 50% of the day is achieved by robotaxis or auto-ubers or whatever the fuck you want to call them... well you can see the implications.
4. Future developments such as electric VTOL, expansion of immersive online environments, loops and hyperloops etc. all can have outsized impact.

266,AT," CREs problem has always been the internet changing the way people buy. I'm actually kind of astonished they've kept building any, at all, after the mid 00s. Box stores were what started the decline, the internet is what ended its life... the last faint pulse in the corpse will cease once work from home becomes a part of standard business practice (and they're already drafting up the strategies for it at most companies) 

I travel for business a lot and am old enough to remember a bit of my adult life, outside the information age, when commercial real estate was needed and vibrant. Been a lot of places, seen a lot of things. Doesn't matter where you go these days, high end or low, all those strip malls, all those little standalones alongside the major artery highways, are a byproduct of the 70s-90s when commercial real estate generated fantastic cash flow WHILE allowing you to hold the underlying asset. 

Now go look at it. Its a complete fucking mess. Basically derelict. People just don't need buildings to sell shit anymore. Strip malls are always filled with the same nonsense businesses (payday advance, restaurants, pawnbrokers, hair parlors, coffee places, ""We Buy Gold"", Oriental Massage...), all of which fold up on a relatively short timeline. 

There just isn't the metabolism for CRE that there once was... and now add work from home? Forget it. I haven't started shorting it because its impossible to time when the jig will finally be up in a shell game of lies but there's no doubt (like, AT ALL) we're going to see a massive reckoning in that world, probably in the near term.

There really aren't many B2B companies that exist that provide consistent work/event space throughout the country other than WeWork (or what they could become)...other than maybe hotels.

&#x200B;

Also WeWork as a brand and marketing company probably has a longer runway, in addition to the fact that they've had enough VC money to stay afloat and are set to be publicly traded. Basically they're not terribly different than Uber (not that I'm suggesting either company has a particularly bright financial future).

275,NIM," not really, I mean, yes they are getting all the holes, but not in this case.  It actually enables economic growth.  You don't have 300k now but you want a house, so you buy the money (take out a loan).    


they earn the spread.  They borrow money from you at 0.5% in an overnight savings account, and lend it out for 30 years at 3.5%.  This is called ""maturity transformation"". They earn 3% on the amount deposited, then lent out, less the reserve requirement.  This earnings stream is called net interest margin.    


In your savings account, you are taking overnight risk and it is FDIC insured.  In a mortgage, the bank is taking 30 year risk, and so is compensated for the time risk plus credit risk.  This is the basis for how a ""normal yield curve"" functions.  Tying money up for longer creates risk that should be compensated for.    


If you lent your friend money for a week at an interest rate, you could give him a lower rate because you know what his condition will be in a week.  If you lend to him for 5 years, you might want a higher interest rate to compensate for that default risk, reinvestment risk, etc.  
On securitization...

Take a bank in south florida, lots of retirees, not a lot of loan demand, but tons of deposits.  They need to sell the money they are buying to make NIM.  They can do so by buying loans from a bank in, lets say Arizona, where there is a population growth of young people that want loans but don't have deposits.  Now the Florida bank is earning money on it's deposits it holds, and the Arizona bank has freed up capital to make new loans, spurring economic growth.  Securitization, if used prudently, is a great thing.",cp123454,7,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n6qu0p/are_we_headed_for_a_massive_failure_in_the/gx8qc8d/,0.074,0.785,0.141,0.9766
276,IO," The bigger issue is that when interest rates go up, they will originate less mortgages.  Remember, they aren't holding those loans to mid-low income borrowers.  They originate the loan and then immediately turn around and sell it, getting it off their balance sheet.    


If they retain servicing for loans to low quality borrowers, that could potentially be a problem.  But retaining servicing is a hedge for an origination pipeline slowing down.    


If you make 0.50% servicing a loan pool of a billion dollars, the slower it pays down the higher the value of that cash flow.  If interest rates drop, those loans refi, and you no longer have that cash flow stream because those loans get refi-ed out of the MSRs.  It's basically the same as owning mortgage IO CMOs.  You are long prepayment risk",cp123454,4,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n6qu0p/are_we_headed_for_a_massive_failure_in_the/gx8terk/,0.08,0.857,0.063,-0.1027
277,HR," I'd 'prefer' to work 10 hours a week rather than 40.  Wish in one hand and shit in the other, tell me which fills up first.  Desires and wishes inevitably succumb to numbers.  What you propose is companies ignoring clear competitive advantage for - what - creature comforts.  Mostly for executives and manager parasites, sure, so they've got say, but that just delays the inevitable, it doesn't prevent it.  The benefits of remote work are extremely expansive.  What does it do to corporate HR departments?  Legal?  Corporations are large beasts nowadays, and they've got a lot of moving pieces, and each will radically change in their necessity, size, etc.  The problems they deal with will change, so they will change in response.  

Sales will obviously persist as a needed service.  But... it will definitely change.  If the majority of your customers no longer have a central office, how do you cope?  If they have a central office, but the departments your product appeals to are fully remote now, how do you cope?  When your competitors are hiring people living in 'the boonies' and to maintain your once-a-week-in-office comfort you can only pay 33% more for entry level positions so they can manage the rent near the metropolis that has the amenities your CEO likes which is increasingly barren... how long do you think this will remain sustainable?",otakucode,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n6qu0p/are_we_headed_for_a_massive_failure_in_the/gxbhuj0/,0.054,0.822,0.124,0.9325

I'm not sure how familiar you are with other pharma/biotech publicly traded companies in development stage. From Phase 2 to the end of 3, they usually undergo many new share issues as well as reverse stock splits. This can easily cut your capital down 80-90%. Meanwhile the CEOs take millions in compensation every year as their company burns cash in clinical trials.

I'm not willing to tie up capital for years like that and watch it depreciate.

When Phase 3 data is close to release I might take a chance on it then.

335,RH," Honestly, im from Europoor and how could anybody fucking believe, that the SEC would be on the ""little mans side""?. Are you fucking serious? 

After all those hearings and shit we read, im slowly more inclined to believe, that even RH may be on our side and is used by the ""big boys"" as an escape goat for January. 
Sure as shit, everybody is painting them as the bad guy and i hope the lesson we learned over the last 5 months of this whole ordeal is, that everything those bought out whores say, is what they are told to say. Kenny Gs 5!! fking lawyers sitting in with him at the first meeting should tell you enough.

When all of this goes tits up, you can bet your last tendie, that RH and us retail investors will be painted as the bad guys, while the FED and the SEC will shove billions in ""bail outs"" to those WS whores, no matter who is at the helm.

336,GME," The hearing seemed to be written for 3 specific ideals:   
   
- Soothing investor sentiment via making the hearing sound/feel good.
   
- Using GME visability to grandstand off-topic positions for future political soundbites (climate/diversity)
  
- provide a platform for distraction via political unity/discourse (i.e. ""look forward to working with you"" and ""unlike my colleagues from the other side of the aisle"")    
   
What the hearing did not do:
Answer any serious question about the effect of rampant naked short selling and its disastrous effects on the market. 

There were a few mentions of the ""squeeze"" back in January but no mention of a potential future squeeze.

I’m not going to try and convince anyone of anything you’ve said nothing to convince me they aren’t on the right track I know that much.  If they can execute what they want to do and that falls on Chen then the company has a ton of potential for the future, there is always a chance they won’t execute and I’d like to see a few nice earnings reports but it’s a gamble on the future.

413,BB," Except your analysis is fundamentally flawed - BB is valued at a far lower P/S for many many reasons. It hasn't got anywhere near the revenue growth of a company like crowdstrike. BB revenue between FY20 - 21 dropped 10%, Crowdstrike grew 80%, Zscaler grew 46%, PNW 18%, Sailpoint 27%. You're comparing a declining company with booming companies and expecting them to share the same valuation.

Not to mention - you're either unaware, or not mentioning the **actual** competitors to BB. Blackberry's Cylance/UEM is more comparable to VMware, or Cisco. Both of which have P/S of around 5, like BB. Companies like Zscaler and SPT don't really have endpoint management or security software, and Crowdstrike's tech blows BB out of the water. Tbh most UES/M companies tech blows BB out of the water - Microsoft, Symantec, VMware etc. PNW UES isn't the best - but they've got a myriad of fantastic enterprise security products besides that, and they don't trade at multiples like Crowdstrike. Don't just lump all companies at the same valuations because they're in the cybersec space - that shows a serious lack of information about the nuances of the industry.

And BB isn't really a serious company when talking about cybersec. This is popular misinformation spread around this sub - when companies are talking seriously about enterprise security, at the top of their minds isn't BB.

Also it's a plain lie to say BB has a moat on all its products. They're barely a competitor on UEM/S. The only moat is QNX, which is an incredibly low revenue product - literally like 4$ or less per car per year.

The EV/AV revolution is a high stakes race, Tesla got significantly ahead in many areas, legacy auto companies got caught with their pants around their ankles. Now the scramble ensues. I think Tesla will keep their superior edge in battery, motor design, and are changing the game on manufacturing of car frames and large components. But Tesla is having trouble with repeated fatal accidents from “FSD” which is a misnomer...they haven’t figured it out. Plus I highly doubt the OS will pass the scrutiny and security measures it needs to have in place to avoid hacking. BB has already achieved higher levels of approval and clearance then Tesla, Tesla can’t compete with BB in Data mining/sharing because Tesla would never sell its tech and capabilities to a competitor for obvious reasons.

481,AMC," Reposting this from last night as a public service announcement. 

AMC on 1/1/2020 (ie pre-covid): 

Enterprise value: $10.8 billion
Market cap: $700 million
Net debt: $10.1 billion
NTM EPS: -$0.57 per share

As of 5/6/2021:

Enterprise value: $15.6 billion (!!)
Market cap: $4.5 billion (!!)
Net debt: $11.1 billion
NTM EPS: -$3.42 per share 

AMC has more debt right now ($11.1bn) than the value of the entire business *pre-covid* ($10.8bn). So even if covid never happened, the stock would be worthless and even the debt wouldn’t recover everything. 

Somehow the business is worth 50% more now AFTER covid. Even with forward EPS down 700%. And even with more movies going direct to streaming and producers cutting the exclusive theatre window? bruh.

However Inovio has an impressive pipeline and  now, after many years of investigation, is very close to succeed and any time within next year will go beyond 100$. 

All these beside that has developed one of the best covid vaccines (96% efficacy and stable at room temperature during months) that will be very useful at countries with not much infrastructure for low temperature storage.

10 vaccines in phase 2 trials, one in phase 3, tons of partnerships, vaccine awards a lot of years in the last 5.  They are definitely not a one trick pony. From what I've read, many long term holders are in it for the hpv or other vaccines. I found out about ino in the fomo covid rush last year, blown away by their covid vaccine: great efficacy, minimal side effects, shelf stable at room temp- potential for global reach. They are also working on a pancovid booster but they have been pushed out of the US market for covid.  Their vaccine requires an electroporation device that the fda has blocked for their covid vaccine for undisclosed reasons, though it has gotten the CE mark in Europe, and the vaccine safety with the delivery device far exceeds other approved vaccines- part of why ino bag holders (like myself) sound like a bunch of raving conspiracy theorists. The science is a whole industry startrek like game changer IF they can get anything to market. 

Unfortunately you have to weigh their lack of FDA or BP connections, what many would call poor management and their targeting by short sellers. Citron made a killing off of them over the last year. 

I was really angry after watching the share price plummet repeatedly over the last year after any good news.  At this point I'm not sure the manament is terrible, but they are playing by the book, and without BP board members, they seem to be at a serious disadvantage for getting anything fast tracked in the US. They are also pursuing partnerships outside of the USA for covid trials which I would call strategic.

Was considering investment in some farming based assets. In the 70s during stagflation those did well compared to other things.

AGCO maybe will see a similar jump? Dunno.

LAND - was considering this. If I understand their model correctly they buy and rent out farmland it's an reit.

CORN - corn based products

MOO - general ag etf I believe

SOYB - think soybean fund - not sure how this works.

662,LAND," I been thinking about this too...

Was considering investment in some farming based assets. In the 70s during stagflation those did well compared to other things.

John Deere (DE) has already skyrocketed so I'm scared there.

AGCO maybe will see a similar jump? Dunno.

LAND - was considering this. If I understand their model correctly they buy and rent out farmland it's an reit.

CORN - corn based products

MOO - general ag etf I believe

SOYB - think soybean fund - not sure how this works.

663,AAPL," ...or sit on their asses so they don't spread china flu...

one faction is saying stay home and be safe, and we will pay you - cost so far $5tn

the other faction is printing $9tn and buying junk bonds with nearly zero % loan offers.

Don't fool yourself into thinking that the Fed is saving the market.  AAPL got a $2bn loan for .25% @20 yrs (how is that good for competition).  The company I work for got a $350M loan to buy a commercial office building for 1.5% - what risk is there to buying office buildings in a pandemic where everyone works from home?   You know that loan wasn't factoring in risk.  And you know the building they bought was 30-50% cheaper 3 yrs ago.

Supply chain will also be driving up costs too yes, but you don't print 20% of all M2 ever created in 9 months without that entering the market, and then add $3-6tn over the next few years from the Treasury...inflation is real, they just don't want to talk about it.

Printing is printing no matter which faction is doing it.",555-Rally,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n71c79/inflation_is_here_all_my_humble_imho_no_financial/gxb3uud/,0.045,0.895,0.06,0.396
664,JP," 😁 I'm all for the GameStop hold - if only to screw the big guys....But silver actually is a great investment, just not SLV which has JP Morgan as custodian and has been known to be short on SLV for a long time. Paid a billion in lawsuits last year for manipulating the market and has been accused of doing far worse for decades.

Demand for actual silver is at historic levels - used in most electronics, cars, solar panels etc. Add to that monetary value as a hedge against rising inflation. It has to go up. It reached $50 over a decade ago when demand was far lower, and the dollar itself was worth far less. You're telling me it's worth less than half at $25? There's nowhere else to go but up. JP Morgan and gang just need to get out of the way first - and for that to happen physical demand has to cause defaults on contracts. When people asking for delivery suddenly don't get it - price is going to go through the roof. A lot of smart people are saying demand is far higher than the number crunchers are showing because they're not properly accounting for hedge purchases as ""demand"" because they're not asking for delivery.

Just don't buy SLV. PSLV or something with physical allocation, not just paper promises that won't put any immediate demand on the real system.

That's my 2 cents. I'm new to all this so please tell me how i'm wrong if you disagree. I will happily listen.",LeonidasSpartan2,-12,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n7021s/_/gxaad8m/,0.1,0.802,0.099,0.5757

799,TLRY," I like TLRY. The merger will result in cost savings. Also, its a medical cannabis company, which makes it more attractive to big pharma. I fully expect it to be acquired. Finally its worth noting that it has a significant short interest. Market Watch says short interest is 20% as of 5.7.21:

857,CRSR," I think the stock simply lacks visibility with investors, people are still discovering that Corsair Gaming is listed. Maybe not enough communication from the company.

&#x200B;

The gist of it though: 

Good Stuff

**1) Cash flow from operating activities** (their core product) is increasing YoY and QoQ. This is really good and healthy.

**2) Inventory turnover** (how many times a company sells its entire inventory stock) has been growing double digit %s for the past four years. That means that people want CRSR's product. But maybe CRSR is leaving money on the table because they're constantly out of stock?

**3) Financial stability** \- they have solid growth in their free cash flow. Their quick ratio is < 1 which is not great, but their current ratio is > 1 which is good (quick = if they had to liquidate everything today, could they cover their debt ... current = are they being hamstrung by debt payments (no they are not)).

**4) Stock value** \- they've given up 33% of their value from 3 months ago. This entire past quarter (for almost the entire tech market it seems) has been a massive haircut. They're consolidating around the low $30s - which if the tech market turns around should be a really healthy thing for CRSR.

Okay Stuff

**5) Branding** \- these guys are operating in a very fragmented space. They're doing the right things with branding, but in the market overall, they're still very much an unheard of name. They're kind of like how Sonos was almost 10 years ago. If Corsair can find a way to get more into the mainstream, then they're golden.

**6) Leadership -** this is the only iffy thing I see with them. They have a solid stack of leadership, but nothing really strikes me as a notable in terms of them pushing for bigger / greater things. As I mentioned before CRSR plays in an ultra-fragmented industry. Sure the big streamers and maybe most of you here know about the name, but a vast majority of people don't. Leadership needs to change this. Point in case, more ppl know about CRSR from streaming and reddit than from anything that leadership is really doing. Grassroots matters, but more is needed to go from early adopters to mainstream market.![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|upvote)",daftstar,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n6t5n6/corsair_gaming_crsr_criminally_undervalued/gxaqivi/,0.035,0.833,0.131,0.9851
859,CRSR," PE ratio isn't horrible compared to many 'growth stocks', but it is still kinda considered a tech stock.  Market seems to be getting more wary of stocks with rapid growth, especially tech and those with high PE.

Looks like CRSR found support around $30.  I'd expect it to keep going up unless their financials and revenue take a bad turn,  only I'd expect the growth of the stock price to be much slower going forward with sell offs any time it starts to rise too fast.

In this market here is the strategy. Do not buy into a stock that jets higher AH because of a good earnings call or news. Rather wait until the next morning and short it at the open.

Zoom peaked at 304, closed at 295

I don't need RSI though, I just listen to the people on Yahoo answers message board and they said to hold. Top tier financial advice.
