3,AGTC," Is what true? 

AGTC jumps in AH from time to time and then loses the gains within a day or two? That‚Äôs true. 5-10% AH jumps aren‚Äôt rocket ships and news conferences aren‚Äôt catalyst for this stock. 

That said it‚Äôs probably a good investment, undervalued and they‚Äôve been having good news and making confident moves.

That was just too much money to completely ignore. 

Now just holding CTXR and hoping for another runup. Wish I got on ATOS when it was still in the 3s but at this point it's just run up too much for me to consider making a considerable plunge.
