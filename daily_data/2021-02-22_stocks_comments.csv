See PLTR...it didn't ""get to pop"" until the institutions had their positions in place. It had hit pieces left and right while it wobbled around 9. Once enough institutional money was in place suddenly PLTR was ""the future"" and the price popped accordingly.

The people who develop the games are not directly hired by Roblox but can be paid through **Robux** (in-game currency), which then can be exchanged for real money.

There are so many games and the kids can make their own (games) and make their own clothing to sell and get ""Robux"" the technology of the games themselves are also much better looking than what most people think. the whole system just improves over time. My daughter took an ID tech Course last summer and her instructor said he played when he was ten and obviously still plays and teaches kids how to make different types of games. its not like a Nintendo switch. this thing has games for every age and every gender and its free to use. the money that goes into it are the things the kids want separately for their avatars or games that they might want to play some you have to pay for but not all. 

they have their own money system and monthly subscription for the money which is ""Robux"" you get 80 for .99   if you join you get 88 for .99 or 440 for 4.99 and you can buy any amount. You can buy clothing for your avatar w the Robux and the amount is free-350+ Robux, most are like 3-5 for shirt and pants but you can buy hair/bodies/clothing/accessories all sorts of things.

39,UK," I'm from the UK and this is pretty accurate.

Not many people here trade. Out of all the people I know only one of my friends trades. My cousin works for a hedge fund, but other than that I don't know a single person who knows the first thing about the stock market, including my dad who's been a lawyer for 30 years.

I think it's just a sort of different mindset over here. As you said a lot of people here think if you trade on the stock market that you're some crazed, cocaine fuelled monster who just gambles away money without even thinking about it.

Our markets are quite a bit different too. I have 20 shares/options positions open and only 5 total are UK companies, feels like there's just more money to be made in the US markets.

Ton of positives however. Two that apply here:  1.  If life gives you lemons, make lemonade... similarly if life gives you $10, turn it into a $ million, and 2. If my life sucks, I will change it. I will not suffer forever and die old and poor and depressed. I will keep fighting and making irrational decisions like investing in GME because I am not going to accept the alternative.

51,UK," Not having an CNBC doesn't mean much, there's the financial times newspaper for example, and bbc business news to name two.

Investing is not a big thing though I agree, I would say because of the risk and not having the drive to learn about it. Also I think the younger millennial generation are the first to be exposed to easier ways to invest, and just the awareness of how shit things really are. I can only see more and more people invest.

One idea I have about is that living in the UK is pretty cheap compared to most countries, provided you don't live in London or similar.

52,UK," I’ve been wondering recently. I’m from UK and been in Canada the last few years, started getting into trading last year after the crash.

I haven’t seen anyone mention the time difference, considering the most valuable companies are based on the US markets, it’s so much easier being on the right time zone if you want to buy/sell intraday. Being out of the loop must make it difficult and far reaching.

Also, just a thought with the talk about it being like gambling, is it possible that people aren’t as interested because literal gambling is much more accessible in the UK?

66,UK," I too am from the UK and it has struck me as strange how little is taught/out there about the stock market. Having done it for two years now full-time I am comfortable calling myself a 'stock trader' as a profession, but I've never met anyone with the same 'title' and only one or two, out of thousands, who were even stock brokers.

I think u/Dracklfaggot makes a good point about how the FTSE has compared with say the S&P 500. Back in the day when I first gained exposure to the stock market I remember briefly comparing the two and have virtually never traded on the UK market in the last six years.

I can also add another reason people in the UK may not trade and its because the much more lucrative US market has a number of barriers to it. Firstly, there's the 'conversion tax.' If you hold shares in a UK account you usually have to pay 1% of the investment to convert to dollars and then another 1% to switch back to sterling when you sell. I'm literally embarrassed by how much money I wasted until I got in with an American brokerage (Schwab). Technically, I still pay the 2%, but its really only when I add or take money out of my account rather than on every damn sale.

Additionally, if you keep your money in a UK brokerage you're usually very restricted on what companies you can buy from/indexes available to you (outside the UK). Finally, there's the time/paperwork angle. It took me several weeks to transfer my assets/cash state-side and while the forms aren't particularly difficult they are daunting for a first-timer.",AuthorAdamOConnell,2,/r/stocks/comments/lp91wj/why_does_investing_in_stocks_seem_relatively/gobmvvf/,0.072,0.87,0.058,-0.4587

I'm in Germany now, but I used to be in a shithole country with no access to any brokerage services. So I opened up an account in a Swiss bank that allowed to do that remotely, and they had brokerage services. The fees were huge though. 30$ per month for the account, plus like 1% brokerage fee.

I looked for other opportunities, and searched through different apps, googled it, as I came to Germany. I was even downvoted to oblivion on /r/germany when I mentioned that finding brokerage services is hard, because apparently most established banks offered it. You just had to know it somehow I guess.

So, I wanted to do it, I was looking at it, I installed several apps on the phone but they all required US residency. I got a very hostile reaction to my points about this.

If I didn't know what stocks were, if I didn't have higher education in economics, I would have never even touched this subject.

This is not advertised, people aren't educated about it, banks don't usually list it as their services.

If I were British, I probably wouldn't be too excited to invest either. They have a few global pharmaceuticals which would be good and maybe Unilever, but the rest are pretty average industrial companies, petroleum, banks, and financial services.

If I wanted to get into Europe, I'd look at Germany ([the DAX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DAX#Components)) which is interesting with major car companies and some big software companies which are the alternatives to the major US business software companies and a few of the global European companies but engaging with Germany means getting involved in the Euro drama. 

Also the DAX with 30 companies has 55% the market cap of the FTSE's 100 companies as well--Germany's top companies are bigger which perhaps reflects being more global.

My second guess would be that maybe in the UK more people have something like a pension so they don't need to be directly investing for their retirements or even keeping track of any of that, whereas pensions have largely gone away in the US in favor of 401k's so we're all much more directly involved in our retirements.

Your point about the USD being the world’s primary reserve currency is a valid one, but your numbers are actually way off. I’m guessing that the reason is either that you have compared apples (S&P 500, consisting of 500 major American companies) with oranges (the far smaller European national indexes consisting of only 25-40 companies depending on country, for example the French CAC40 or German DAX30) OR that you forgot to adjust for the USD exchange rate. If we’re wondering why retail investors are more common in country X than in country Y, we don’t care about stock market X’s returns in Y currency, we want to compare X returns in X currency to Y returns in Y currency.

The European index most comparable to the S&P 500 is the EURO STOXX 600, which is up 147% since the GFC in 2007.

The CAC All Shares index, which is a better gauge on the French stock market than the very limited CAC 40, is up 36% since DCC and 26% since GFC.

The German CDAX is up 176% since DCC and 135% since GFC.

The British FTSE All Share is up 117% since DCC and 135% since GFC.

So the S&P500 has indeed outpaced most European indices for the past 20-ish years, but not nearly enough to account for a stated major difference in share ownership between the US and the UK. Also, we have to remember that most stock investors don’t invest in indices, they stock pick, at least to some degree. And it would’ve been possible to achieve returns of several hundred percent in either of these markets over the last 20 years with reasonably successful stock picking.

So what’s the real reason? I don’t know for sure, but I would argue that it probably has more to do with culture and incentives than with market returns. For one thing, taxes have typically been lower in the US than in Europe, meaning that all else equal investing has been more lucrative in the US. More importantly, I believe, is that most European nations have some kind of government-sponsored pension system. In the US meanwhile, people have to fund their own retirement through 401k’s and other forms of more or less government-incentivized saving and investing. Lastly, there are ”inexplicable” cultural differences between countries. Sweden and Finland are the countries with the largest portion of retail investors in the world.

110,VERY," While this could be part of the explanation, I would also add that European countries tend to be social welfare states where in the US you need to prepare for your own retirement. You have 401k and IRAs in the US to help prepare for retirement and as a result an abundance of investor education has come with that. Even if you're a buy and hold Boglehead, index investor, you've still put in the time and effort to understand how the market works.

Another difference is with the institutional investor base. In Europe, much of it is government pension money (particularly Germany), insurance companies... VERY conservative, more dividend focus which does have some impact on how European companies will be run

If you go to Asia, you have very active retail investor bases... possible due to the lack of social safety net (as in the US). I'm thinking Taiwan and HK in particular... not as familiar with Japan's retail investor culture

One thing I would point out about your comparison of global equity market indexes... US S&P - +160% since peak of dot com bubble and +160% since GFC, which means that the S&P was basically flat over those 7 years (technically, more of a very wide V-shape) so the time in the market/timing the market argument doesn't quite hold here... conversely, HK and Australia are the opposite (big moves between dot com to GFC but flat post GFC)

You could argue that there are bigger underlying macro trends at play here. The US market is driven very much by tech where the macro environment (Internet 1.0 - building the network infrastructure and Internet 2.0 - social media, online commerce, cloud computing) has very much been led by US companies. That period between dot com and GFC, this was the rise of China - hence the strong market performances in HK and Australia (providing a lot of those natural resources which China didn't have enough of)

Overall I would recommend avoiding any major bias to particular geographic markets unless you're sure that It's overly risky or overly profitable, and that's a strategic decision you have to make but It's important to keep an open mind. Global diversification of both assets and markets is key to long term growth with reduced volatility. 

Personally, most of the money I have exposed to stock markets is done through managed funds - of which about 35% is US exposure, which is far below the international Index, because I am of the opinion that the US is, overall, overvalued. The only direct shares I own are small cap penny stocks on my local market (Australia), and stock in an unlisted American company (that might go public soon via SPAC, It used to be on the Australian share market because it was easier to raise capital initially here, but they eventually chose to delist and I decided to keep the shares).",Dracklfaggot,2,/r/stocks/comments/lp91wj/why_does_investing_in_stocks_seem_relatively/gobk34f/,0.042,0.78,0.178,0.9862

If you're a value investor Japan looks like a heaven (which could ultimately be a value trap. Undervalued =/= quality).

Just depends how long you're comfortable holding these cheap as fuck stocks that have barely moved in years. You might be kept holding them for many years yet before others start getting interested and you start making gains. 

I'd also point out that the lack of dividends counted in the Index really undersells Australia on first.

You can buy US-Stocks and ETFs for NASDAQ or the S&P500 just fine here.
But the home bias here is just as strong as in the US (but it doesn't benefit you here)

Recently the most popular ETFs in Germany/Europe  are tracking indices like the MSCI DEVELOPED WORLD or MSCI EMERGING MARKETS so stocks all around the globe (with a tilt towards the US). ETFs are very new here and only avaible for the retail trader for a few years (with reasonable cost) 

 In Germany: Stocks are especially unpopular here.
 
1) Our culture ist very focused on security, so volatile and unpredictable assets are less popular.

2) Our retirement system does not use long term assets or stocks. Money that people pay into the system gets spend immediately on the current generation of retirees. When you just rely on the government system you have zero contact with investing. There are no 401k or Roth IRA. 

3) in 2000 the government pushed the telecom stock (wkn: 555750) as a ""Volksaktie"" meaning ""people's stock"".
When you track the performance since 2000 you know that A LOT of people got burned. People bought into this because politicians told them to without knowing the risk.

\- Invest accounts are taxable. You have to report to HMRC, and pay any tax on profits above the threshold which is £12,300.

\- The ISA has slightly less stocks you can legally invest in. For example NIO can't legally be held in an ISA, so must be held in a general investment account. You also can't trade derivatives such as CFDs, spread betting or options within an ISA. This might not even be relevant depending what you invest in. For me it's not an issue at all. Everything I want can be added to an ISA.

>you have no chance of making over £12,300 profit per year anyway?

Well profits are theoretically unlimited. You could easily make more than £12,300 in an ISA or Invest account.

282,SQ," Not financial advice. 

A few things to unpack here. I'm not sure how much you could/want to invest in SQ. But consider a few things.

A general pattern so far this earnings season has been that companies have been beating earnings, but generally not guiding to the expectations of the street. So the stock doesn't shoot up after it reports. Generally it has been going down by like 5% or so, even after reporting a beat. If SQ misses earnings...oh boy. If they beat it, and guide poorly...the stock could go down. If they beat it and guide well...most likely the stock will go up.

SQ has many catalysts coming up this year. And increasingly people are associating SQ as the ""Bitcoin"" stock. I'm expecting that as BTC goes up, so will SQ.

If you have like 25k-27k to invest in the stock, are willing to be a long-term holder, and are willing to live with yourself if you miss out on a huge pop after earnings....then you could consider selling puts (expiring upcoming Friday), for anywhere between $250/share to $270/share. This is just Cash Secured Put strategy.

Another ""safe-ish"" way could be to buy a portion of your allocation to SQ before earnings, and if it drops, and you still believe in the stock, buy the rest of it after earnings.

Overall, if you have enough of a conviction, and want to be a long-term SQ holder, a bad earnings report probably isn't the worst thing.",aarsh96,1,/r/stocks/comments/lp971y/too_late_for_sq/goafs35/,0.048,0.869,0.083,0.8739

If you must chase returns, use a balanced fund or something that is bond related, even a CD, for that matter.

588,EV," Statistics are tricky. They only apply if the sample size is long enough, so it becomes tricky to apply it to your situation. 

You can compare it a bit to buying a house on a volcano. The view is absolutely stunning (good returns) and the realtor assures you the volcano erupts only once every 100 years. But those 100 years are an average, the volcano is just as likely to erupt next year as it is to erupt in 20 years. 

So asking for a 2 to 3 year safe window in ARKK is missing the point. There is no guarantee. They might do well, or get hit massively by an EV bubble in the coming years. 

The question you should be asking is how much risk am I willing to take with this money?

591,CEO," I’m mainly a growth small-cap investor and I back all my buys with fundamental analysis. What I do to find new holdings is this:

1. Use a screener like Finviz or Yahoo Finance to find companies that have been growing revenue 30%+ per quarter on a consistent basis with market cap under $10B and over $300M (you can use this method for bigger companies too). Use filters to take out the industries I’m not comfortable investing in (biotech and healthcare in my case). If a company isn’t growing at this rate consistently (an off-quarter or two can be forgiven, but not more), I won’t even look at it TBH.

2. Do a quick Google search to find what the business description and model is for the top growing and most compelling companies on the screener and see if it’s something that interests you and you see potential in.

3. Use P/S ratio to do a quick sweep and see which of the companies might be overvalued. For reference, if revenue is growing 30-40% consistently per quarter, my limit is a 10 P/S ratio. 40-45% 15 P/S ratio. 45-55% 20 P/S Ratio. 55-60% 25 P/S ratio. 60-70% 30 P/S Ratio, 70-80% 40 P/S Ratio, 80-100% 50 P/S ratio, 100%+ 50+ P/S ratio. 

4. For the ones that have a reasonable P/S ratio relative to their revenue growth, I import them to an Excel spreadsheet and take a deep dive into their financial statements, management team, institutional and insider ownership, CEO interviews, Glassdoor ratings, CAGR of industry and use all of this information to gauge its growth potential and whether it’s an attractive investment or not. P/S ratio by itself is a very poor indicator on an investment’s viability, so you really have to look carefully at all the financials to make a good choice.",elvita12345,2,/r/stocks/comments/lp90k6/finding_stocks/gob9izw/,0.02,0.856,0.124,0.9791

597,GME," I am not saying that Burry is right, but you don't give a single reason why he is wrong and here you are wrong.

1. His  Hedge Fund was nearly bankrupted because a lot of his clients withdrew  their money. He underperformed due to his investment into CDS. After that he posted  489%  increase in 2008.
2. Nothing  to do with luck. He made great gain in 2001 and 2002 as well when the  S&P 500 was negative. I think he would have been known in investment  circles even without his great 2008 investment.
3. He  bought most of GME in late 2019/early 2020 where the price hovered  around 4$. He sold all of it in Q4 of 2020, where the price was around  15$. That is nearly a 4x increase in less than a year. I don't know in  which bubble you are living in, but 4x on an investment in a year is  tremendous. Yes he might have made more staying invested in it, but it  was not a given that the short squeeze would happen.
4. Shorted  Tesla. Yea, why not. Tesla's valuation makes no sense no matter how you  look at it. Add the recalls, and increased competition and it makes  even less sense. Let's see in 3 years if he was right about Tesla.
5. He  is an active investor, so given his bias I wouln't count it against him  that he talks about an index bubble -  and chances are high that prices  are inflated due to many passive investors.
6. How  do you know Hyperinflation won't happen in the US? Any proper reasons,  historical examples or number that you can back it up?

Take CURI. 1.1b in market cap. Most recent quarter they had 8m in revenue. So it’s priced around 350x revenues. (Edit 30x revenues)

668,IRS," The answer is yes.

[IRC Sec. 165 ](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/165) outlines the deductibility of losses. Specifically, IRC Sec. 165(f) includes losses incurred from exchanges of capital assets as determined on IRC Sec. 1211 and IRC Sec. 1212.

The main sections that you should be familiar with are [IRC Sec. 1211](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/1211) and [IRC Sec. 1212.](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/1212). IRC Sec. 1212(b) is the section that deals with netting your gain and losses, whether they are short-term or long-term. Should you have a loss, IRC Sec. 1211(b)(1) limits it to the lower of any remaining loss or $3,000 per subsequent year.

In plain English, carryover capital losses are subject to several IRC sections. IRC Sec. 1212(b) tells you whether you have one, IRC Sec. 165(f) says that you are entitled to deduct it in your tax return, and finally IRC Sec. 1211(b) limits it to $3,000 per year.

One important note that I was not aware of until someone corrected me is that if you have carryover capital losses, you have to use at maximum $3,000 every year; even if you don't have any taxable gain. As long as you have any carryover loss, the way the IRS created the calculation forms, $3,000 will expire every year regardless of whether you use it or not. Also note that carryover losses are used after the standard/itemized deduction. So for 2019, you must have at least $12,200 in income before you see any benefit from carryovers capital losses.",Reddit_Man71,3,/r/stocks/comments/lp9ps8/do_you_have_to_pay_taxes_on_reinvested_and/goau69u/,0.105,0.811,0.084,-0.6705

Then once you started your account, bought some ETFs and started learning about investing in general and getting more knowledgeable, THEN you look at individual stock with the money you'll contribute from now on. Start by getting your feet wet before diving in.

You're talking about Crypto brokers. I'd stay away from crypto no matter what your friend had told you. I don't say there's no money to be made, but I really don't see it as a good place to start investing. 

You should look at brokers like fidelity or schwab (i don't really know US brokers, i'm canadian. Do your own research).

Avoid big money stock? You mean the stocks that are more expensive per share? If you make a proper DD and the company is a good investment, there's no reason not to buy it just because you'll have less share in the end.",Vendura663,1,/r/stocks/comments/lp8nfg/best_way_to_get_started/goa2hvc/,0.089,0.775,0.136,0.9228

That being said, my non-financial advice is to learn how to read financial reports and do good research before u trade.

TD ameritrade has a lot of youtube videos about technical terms/concepts.

Investopia.com has alot of articles about basic and advanced finance stuff too.

Ultimately it's up to you to teach yourself to how to do good research and find out what works for u.

682,AP," >	My understanding is that ETFs do not invest your money, secure profits and distribute earnings to individual shareholders. 

False. They do invest your money - just that they invest it in other companies - and not in running a business. They use your money to buy shares of the constituent companies 

The prices of an ETF reflect the prices of the underlying companies. This is maintained mainly by authorized participants - whose mechanism I'll explain below. At the core of an ETF is the issuer of the ETF. New units of the ETF can be created by the issuer, and existing units can be extinguished for underlying shares by the issuer. The AP can buy the underlying shares of the ETF, and take it to the ETF issuer, who will give them 1 unit of the ETF in return. This is called creation. The AP can also take one unit of the ETF to the issuer, and get underlying company shares in return. This is called redemption.

An AP will try to create units when the ETF is overvalued (it is cheaper to buy constituent stocks than the ETF) - and then sell those ETF units. The selling brings down the ETF prices.
When the ETF is undervalued, the AP will try to redeem units (since the constituents are worth more than the ETF). This takes away liquidity from the ETF, driving up prices.

Thus, (relatively) efficient markets maintain a no-arbitrage condition between ETFs and their constituents",DoYouRemember2020,1,/r/stocks/comments/lpohrb/what_determines_the_price_of_an_etf/god8sdt/,0.0,0.902,0.098,0.9638

692,PEG," I prefer to measure the value of a company by comparing it to those in its industry and closest competitors. I start by finding which metrics would be most useful for this calculation. To do this, I use this [correlation feature](https://theportfoliolab.com/compare), and pick a few metrics that I think will be most correlated with the market caps of these companies. Usually, I pick revenue, gross profit, net income as at least one of these metrics tend to have decent correlation for a set of companies.

Once I've settled on one or two metrics that will be the backbone of my analysis, I look at the historical and forecasted growth of this metric(s) as well as the price-to-<metric> ratio. It's also really good to combine these two metrics, such as looking at the PEG ratio. To perform all these side-by-side comparisons, I'll use this [distribution feature](https://theportfoliolab.com/compare). For example, if a company's PEG ratio is in the lower half of the industry and its net income forecasted growth is in the upper half, this is a good signal for me. The further the company ranks towards each extreme, the better. If this is the case, the company is expected to have good growth in the future, but the market isn't valuing/pricing in this growth. Assuming you agree that the growth will be sustainable, it could be a good buying opportunity.

I don't think it really matters if the company's market cap is <$1B or >$1T as absolute values are not used in the calculation. The main thing is how strong+sustainable the growth is and how much of this growth has already been priced into the value of the stock.",Currie32,2,/r/stocks/comments/lpmc9i/how_to_evaluate_whether_stock_price_is_too/gocadx9/,0.012,0.807,0.181,0.9925

724,DD," Absolutely. I do not have the most thorough technical DD. But I do have personal experience using the product as well as competitors.  

You are correct in saying that transfer is becoming digital. However, digital transfers have limitations, especially when talking international transactions and over certain amounts. 


MoneyGram as far as I know has excellent partnerships in place as well for some time now which has shown me they are progressive and forward thinking. For example, they partnered with PayPal LONG ago in order to actually do in person cash transactions.  

MoneyGram is also ahead of the game here because they are incorporating blockchain technology (Ripple and XLM) into their system. 

I have also read that many of their insiders are buying shares which is an extremely healthy indicator. This is according to Sec report. 

Anyhow I am sure there is plenty more, these are just the personal reasons as to why I believe they are very undervalued",dromance,1,/r/stocks/comments/lpoja6/moneygram_international_mgi_down_almost_20/god04gr/,0.0,0.892,0.108,0.9381

727,BB, I agree with your concerns but I think it all depends on how well they can stand out from their competitors and I’m really looking at this for the long term like short term fluctuations won’t bother me because there definitely is some hidden value that doesn’t warrant its current low price.

752,AI," I'd be curious to know as well, but hypothetical example (let me know if I make mistakes)

Let's say company A had stock at $100 at the start of the day, something happens, and at the end of the day their stock is worth 102, but it bounces around between the two a bit

If no trading happens, then everyone holding the stock has increased portfolio worth

If normal trading happens, then people can cash out if they sell or buy in/invest, at the market price, and this will cause some fluctuations

If HFT happens, by detecting an uptrend and buying at 100.5 and selling at 101.5 (let's assume they somehow detect an increase in buy prices at 100 and then a plateau at 102, but need some time to detect that, thus the .50) - then for each stock that they managed to pull that off for, the people buying/selling are fighting computer AI with very low latency trading that will get $ that would have otherwise gone to the stock owners

If a lot of HFT happens, then the stock might shoot above 102 as a lot of them buy in, and then crash as they start to sell off for a profit, again detecting the dip/change in trend before human retail investors are able to

If a .1% tax was implemented, then the HFT would pay ~.10, as would the retail investors, but if it happens daily then the HFT would be high harder as they would be trading more often, but really their trading doesn't benefit the market, it just pulls $ from other investors (which is sometimes the company, as companies can buy back stock to invest in themselves, or issue stocks to raise money as a form of loan)

Realistically thought the HFT don't make $1/100 profit, but probably .1, and this wouldn't be able to use their microsecond advantage if they need 100 transactions to grab $1, and they are probably sliding in and doing something shady like detecting when someone puts in a buy order at market price vs someone who has a fixed price sell limit at say 101, buying it at $101, and then quickly selling it at $101.01 instead, basically completing a few transactions before the market buy order goes through (or in reverse when someone does a market sell and shorts the stock rather than buying in advance)",sintaxer,2,/r/stocks/comments/lpunkf/is_high_frequency_trading_good_for_retail_trader/god7j3n/,0.05,0.885,0.065,0.6531

756,GME," Well I can tell You about Europe as I live in Hungary. 

The countries that have their own currency are experiencing inflation, in Hungary for instance housing prices tripled in a decade. Yet the central bank deliberately undermeasures inflation, to keep us competitive (=we work for buttons). Which has its own comic moments. I work for a large multinational company, the European leadership most likely decided to give everyone a raise to compensate for inflation. So we got 2.8% raise. When the inflation is 10-15% in reality. So the management was pleased with themselves how generous they were and everyone in the factory is pissed off, as we are basically loosing money. So the central European situation is simple: Our government simply hides inflation and does not care if we are screwed. Most likely they have been operating in complete darkness for years, the government has absolutely no idea what happens in our economy any more.

Funny story from here: In theory our healthcare is free and universal. The minimum amount you pay is \~30 USD per month and you get full coverage for that. Sounds nice? Well we have this problem that most doctors live not from their salaries but bribes patients slip them in order to get any kind of treatment. So, this year our glorious government decided that they will end this with a reform and increase doctors salaries to the point they no longer rely on bribes. Well guess what: the raise they thought was so low, that most doctors were offended by it. Looks like the government can not even estimate what amount a doctor earns, even if they try to. 

The Budapest Stock Exchange is a joke, I never bought Hungarian papers, but had some nice US stocks. Actually I am more confident in the companies overseas than in the infinite insider trading that our local stock exchange turned into. You certainly have heard about GME. Well, hundredfold increases are not that rare in here, it is a form of converting political power to material gains. If you are interested, I can tell you some tales. 

You see, the confidencein the US system is still there and will not go away in the short term, until our governments perform even more crazy moves.",Durumbuzafeju,1,/r/stocks/comments/lpn42s/do_you_think_there_is_a_bubble_minidd_inside/godurha/,0.067,0.806,0.127,0.9784

774,ACB, Do you ever bother to read financials? ACB is a frickin sinkhole. All the rest of that is gibberish.,newBDS2017,2,/r/stocks/comments/lpbhb2/my_watchlist_for_2222021_my_favorites_are_aapl/gobcw4q/,0.124,0.876,0.0,-0.34
775,ACB," I am one of those burned retards. Invested at $8 two or three years ago and rode it to about $16 then sold. Bought back at twelve and rode it to $18 then it took a dump that it hasn't recovered from. Plus they split the stocks about six months ago if I'm remembering right so pretty much everyone that was in it lost half their shares in a day so recovery for the old investors is nearly impossible with my break even price at over $100. 

ACB to be is a poor investment and likely going to be put out of business or bought out by it's competitors before recovering. Granted I'm no expert and that was my first stock trade ever.",JoeMomma225,2,/r/stocks/comments/lpbhb2/my_watchlist_for_2222021_my_favorites_are_aapl/goaxl9v/,0.078,0.858,0.064,-0.2225
776,REAL," paper trade for now. If you wanna throw some money on something find a nice growth fund and throw x amount per month on that fund and get your retirement started. Now don't get me wrong if you got a couple hundred to burn maybe a couple thousand have fun with losing some REAL money, but at your skill level it will be basically gambling, so take whatever money you are comfortable seeing hit zero, 2-500 maybe as much as a grand or two. Diversify with small investments so you don't lose it all on one go. And that way you can learn by an 80$ loss instead of an 800$ loss or 8000$ loss. And it kind of teaches you with a bit of a sting attached.",Upper-Director-38,1,/r/stocks/comments/lpww1f/how_to_get_into_the_stock_market_as_a_minor/godrpa2/,0.076,0.786,0.138,0.8276
777,GME," Yes. Ever watch the John Mulaney bit about college in his Kid Gorgeous special? If not, trust me, it’s worth the time. 

Seriously though, it’s about perspective and experience. If you paper trade for a while and you can see some trends (bull market vs the correction we’re almost certainly hurtling towards), and watch some interesting case studies in real time (TSLA, GME, PBR). Several months of bull market after a pandemic triggered crash is not typical of playing the market. It offered you no real insight into how things will work over the next 45 years.",Strongest-There-Is,0,/r/stocks/comments/lpww1f/how_to_get_into_the_stock_market_as_a_minor/godgkyx/,0.116,0.74,0.144,0.6238
778,IR," Oh good, makes it easier if you're used to essentially mildly informed gambling anyway if you've gotten used to losing money on sports. Sports and horses is how I like to think about the high risk stocks. Yeah its a risk but its not completely up to chance like a casino. Go into it with as much info as possible so you can bet on it like you would sports as a pro scout and horse racing as a livestock judge. But you still should only throw down what you can afford to lose because anything might happen, even a sure thing might shit the bed, Curry might go down with a knee sprain in the second, Horse 4 might bump into your horse on turn 3. Sometimes you just get lazy and look at stats and see obviously Green Bay's gonna win at those odds they're basically giving you money! but you didn't dig quite enough and realize that the odds are so skewed because Rodgers has a concussion and half their D line is on IR. One big difference is if you could take out the bet halfway through the second because they're losing for a X% loss. Yeah you didn't lose it all but sometimes they come back with a second half win and you basically panicked yourself out of profit. Hard part is finding out when you are riding a sinking ship to the depths or when its just a bit of a rough waters and you'll be smooth sailing in another week.",Upper-Director-38,1,/r/stocks/comments/lpww1f/how_to_get_into_the_stock_market_as_a_minor/goduqdy/,0.111,0.751,0.138,0.8354
