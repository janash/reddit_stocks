I also think they've got a product that scales pretty well.  It's very cheap to make, but clearly has value.  People don't just want a soft drink... they want coke.

It's also worth noting: during recessions/depressions people still splurge on small things to feel good.  Soft drinks I believe fall in that category.  Nobody *needs* it, but sometimes, that sugar rush feels good, or brings back nostalgia, etc. etc.  That's huge. Brands wish they had that.

25,USA," God guys... where do you get your info?

There is a big difference between tap water, water from reverse osmosis, and highly purified (distilled... ill just refer to it as purified) water. Basically its the level of particles in the water. Tap is usually just chemically treated (fluoride) to kill bacteria. This is the minimum safety standard for drinking. Reverse osmosis removes some minerals but not all and is between 95% and 99% pure h2o (gets worse as filters clog and such). Fully purified is basically 100% water and is temperature treated (boiled).

Tap and reverse osmosis pretty much taste the same, at least it does to me. Purified however tastes very different. Which one you prefer is up to you but in terms of safety, purified is by far, the safest form of water and no, you cannot achieve that with a reverse osmosis system.

Tap water is usually fine, especially for cooking, but the problem is its run by government... government is not always reliable precisely because their lives dont depend on it. They get paid no matter what and that makes them lazy. There is no profit and loss to worry about. Not trying to scare people from government water, historically they have done a great job, but even in the USA, there have been times when water is tainted, most recently in Michigan not too long ago.

Basically some politicians wanted to cut costs and shift money to some other businesses (who likely paid them), and they did that by cutting funding to water because they felt it was a waste of money... End result was a disaster and poisoned water. It happens. Even in 1st world nations. Sometimes its an accident. Sometimes its a business dumping toxins in a nearby water source.

Dont know about you, but I have a wife and 3 kids. I am not going to gamble on their health over $30/month... Ill take the purified water. Also, as matter of opinion, it tastes so much better to me. Though for the record, I actually think tap water tastes better in coffee and I use it for cooking. In both cases it is heated to a boil.",thejumpingsheep2,-1,/r/stocks/comments/oooeuu/cocacola_quarterly_revenue_tops_2019_levels/h61edfv/,0.142,0.76,0.097,-0.9633

70,LLNW," Ever: SDRL

I bought on 11/19/14 for ~$20 as oil started crashing expecting a quick rebound to go with my nice dividend. Then I bought more 7 days later at ~$16 and more again 2 days later at ~$14. Then I sat with a bag as the dividend was quickly suspended and the stock continued to sink. Then they went through bankruptcy 3.5 years later. I came out of bankruptcy with 0.44% of the shares I originally held. I refused to sell those shares for several years as a reminder each time I looked at my portfolio to not throw good money after bad. Develop an investment thesis, abide by it, and sell when the thesis no longer applies. 

I had a small swing trade in 2016 in SDRL which helped me recoup some of my money. All in all, I lost 85% of my money that went into SDRL, by far my biggest dollar loss.

Right now: LLNW. Biggest $ loser at the moment. Down 43%. Holding to see how earnings are this quarter but they are currently on my Sell Watchlist.",interrobangbros,6,/r/stocks/comments/ooqn12/what_are_the_heaviest_bags_youre_carrying_now_and/h60ahxl/,0.084,0.887,0.029,-0.7652

167,TWO," Chargepoint always seemed kind of dubious to me. There's lots of competition, and more and more talk of Tesla opening its charging network. It's kind of a race to the bottom, makes it hard to put forward a legit case for investing in an individual player in the charging network space.

I think the big lesson is don't buy a stock unless you really believe in the company. It's tempting to make short-term speculative moves like that, but at the end of the day, it is basically gambling.

FWIW I'm not trying to bash your investing skills. I made the same mistake. I invested in ZEV (Lightning eMotors) because I thought the rising tide of EVs would lift all EV companies. Right now it's one of the most beat down stocks I own. Every SPAC has gotten crushed, but this one more so than others, because as an EV company, it's generating very little excitement.

I'm hoping that eventually this inflation discourse will tire out, because oh my god, imagine living in a world with TWO PERCENT INTEREST RATES! Gasp, growth stocks could never survive!

If you were a god of trading, and put in $1000 to monster around the beginning of 2000, at 9 cents per share, you would have 11,112 shares. If you let go of those shares when tesla IPO'd (June 29, 2010), you would get around $6.60 a share, netting you $73,340. If you then put that money into XPEL INC shares, for 4 cents a share, you would get 1,833,480 shares, which would be worth about $170.5 million today.

> I've only told this to a few people, but I was 16 years old when I bought 200 shares of the REIT you mentioned ( Diversified Mortgage Investors) for less than $1 each. Over the years and after 5 two for one splits, my 200 shares grew to 6400 shares, and that's not counting the spinoff of Fortive and Vontier. I've only sold a relatively few shares but at this point in time, my less than $200 investment, would be worth, just for the DHR shares, $1,510,400! This was by my younger self, not a good investment, it was a FREAKING GREAT investment. Best of my life. I intend to continue to hold DHR, selling a few here and there to indulge myself and hopefully leave my family a nice nest egg one day. Got to thank that 16 year old version of me for taking a shot with that little unknown REIT. Too bad he didn't pick up 1000!

Any others that people can think of?

324,SFT, There were some strategies I didnt do that I know people got burned on. There were two that I did. One was buying a company called Shift or SFT. I held the stock for almost a year and it didnt react to anything. He recommended buying at around $10.00 a share which it hasnt hit since his recommendation. I only bought 5 shares just fun to see if I could make a short term play on it but I held for a year and it dropped significantly and stays between the $6.00-$8.00 mark every time. Another one was using Block fi to buy crypto and earn interest. After the Elon scare on Twitter crypto took a hit he completely changed his stance on crypto going from making bullish cryto videos to bearish takes on crypto and not only that but the platform as well. He completely made a 180 on the platform he was sponsored by which was Blockfi and said they were too risky and now recommends CoinBase or Robinhood. Which brings me to another point. This one I didnt do because I learned to start taking everything he says with a grain of salt and thank goodness I did but he was recommending to buy CoinBase stock anywhere under $400.00 in a video right before the IPO. He also recommended people to buy Tesla above the $800.00 mark (which thank god I didnt listen) because in his financial analysis he put them as a multi trillion dollar company bringing in over 1 trillion dollars in revenue trading at a PE over 80. There are many more examples I can give too but this is just to name a few. I used to watch him a lot because I was a newbie in stocks and was looking for guidance and while I did get a little burned on some of his stock recommendations it did teach me valuable lessons and because of that I am a much better investor today.,JRshoe1997,2,/r/stocks/comments/ooi1z8/is_enph_overvalued/h60kmxd/,0.031,0.845,0.124,0.9787
325,API," How come software ($150)that rips more than the websites($80) is better? 

How can you trust a software? How reliable are they? How much storage does it occupy in a system?  Installing software sometimes makes the system work slow.

326,UI," $80/month = $960/year, versus $150 one-time + $50/year. There's a huge difference there.

I'm running the demo of TradingDiary Pro on my Surface Pro X, which is a deathly slow machine to begin with, and it's translating x86 to ARM64 instructions. It's fast enough. Speed isn't the problem, here, because you're not using the software to do something in real time. You're analyzing your own trading behavior and results outside of trading hours. 

I'm not sure what trust and storage have to do with anything. The software doesn't connect to your brokerage. You import data into it by exporting data into .csv files from your brokerage, and then importing it from the .csv files. Storage is negligible.

Yes, everything is a rip-off. You can use Excel. Good luck creating a truly useful spreadsheet without VBA, and if you use VBA, good luck maintaining it. 

I want a slick UI that gives me insight into my own trading data. TradingDiary goes a long way. All I want to know is whether there's anything better than it in the market.

I'm a trader, not a developer. I don't have time to mess with python. I download data (lately, using Google Finance) and import it into R for statistical analysis and trade planning. Hedge funds, investment banks, and prop trading firms have enough money to hire statisticians and python developers to develop the trading algos that they run. I'm just one person who collaborates with friends to fight them.

Is there anything better than TradingDiary Pro in the market?

327,IRS," You would have to wait 31 days , or pay the tax . IRS is a pain in the bum, they will want their fair share. Pay up or get fine . No harm done on your end so far, but you will have to pay taxes for this particular case. Sorry bud. Ask your dad to help you.",Traditional_Good4693,1,/r/stocks/comments/oodm3q/trying_to_understand_wash_sale/h5zjzuo/,0.179,0.674,0.147,-0.0258
328,IRS," The wash-sale rule is an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regulation that prevents a taxpayer from taking a tax deduction for a security sold in a wash sale. The rule defines a wash sale as one that occurs when an individual sells or trades a security at a loss and, within 30 days before or after this sale, buys a ""substantially identical"" stock or security, or acquires a contract or option to do so. A wash sale also results if an individual sells a security, and the individual's spouse or a company controlled by the individual buys a substantially equivalent security - from Investopedia. 

Let’s suppose you buy 1000 shares of a stock and then a year later sell that for your 8000 dollar loss. You feel like the stock has bottomed, a so ten days later, you re-buy the 1000 shares and then six months later you sell them all for you $6000 gain. There is no loss to count against your gain. Re-purchasing the same security within 30 days nullifies the loss. 

The rule is in place for very common sense reasons which are pretty obvious to astute investors, but it doesn’t seem that you are getting replies thus far from people who actually understand the wash sale rule. 

So in your specific case, buying back your original position within 30 days nullifies the loss, and if you sell the second tranche, you will owe taxes (short-term or long-term capital gains, depending on the holding period) on your $6000 gain. 

Also from Investopedia - The wash-sale rule prevents taxpayers from deducting a capital loss on the sale against the capital gain. 

So the rule is in place essentially just to prevent investors from doing exactly what you are trying to do. 

Sorry, bud. IRS is a cruel bitch.",ParlayPayday,0,/r/stocks/comments/oodm3q/trying_to_understand_wash_sale/h5xxzd6/,0.082,0.79,0.128,0.8271
329,ABC," This!  This is the thing you have to understand about wash sales. Yes, you have an 8k loss but it will not count towards this years taxes until you let the transaction settle (30 days). Example, you take an 8k loss on ABC stock, you sell. The price of ABC drops significantly 20 days later and you decide okay I’m buying again, you decide to hold the stock now until past the end of the year. Because you never let that transaction settle (you reentered the trade again 20 days later) that 8k loss is not accounted for in that tax year. It won’t actually get counted until you sell and allow it to settle. People who constantly swing trade the same stock and have losses that accumulate but keep getting washed sometimes run into bad tax situations. It’s always good to keep track it most brokerages keep track for you.",calipfarris01,2,/r/stocks/comments/oodm3q/trying_to_understand_wash_sale/h5y6xjp/,0.096,0.843,0.062,-0.7745
330,IRS," You are actually right about the loss getting added in to basis of the next purchase in some cases. But not all. 

For example, I do almost all my trading in tax-exempt accounts. I only use my taxable brokerage account for buy-and-hold investments (ie “never sell” positions).  Cost basis on wash sale losses cannot be added in to purchases in those accounts. So I am not used to benefiting in this manner and didn’t even consider it. My oversight. 

If you are doing all of your trading in taxable accounts and giving away all that money to the government every time you trade, you are correct and adding a little to the basis from an unfortunate loss certainly helps.   See IRS pub 550 page 57 for details.

If you’re in the money within an acceptable percentage and it’s not a long play, take the money. 

- Rule #2: Don’t get greedy

Don’t wait it out. If you’re hovering over the sell button waiting for just a little bit more you run the risk of getting caught in a random down swing. 

- Rule #3: Be patient

If you’ve done your DD and are confident in the company, just be patient. Spread risk over time, the longer you can wait the more likely a profit becomes.

372,DD," So, with every investment that you make, you should research and have an entry price and an exit price.  If your research says 20% is the exit price then go for it.  Some companies that number might be higher.  Personally, I don’t invest in a company to only see a 20% increase.  It’s probably not worth my time.  I invest for at least a 100% increase or more.

Take for example SLI.  I invested at like $2.20 a share.  I liked the technology they bring to the Lithium market, as I see them as not just another Lithium mining company.  Stock shot up the other day to like $8.00+.  I didn’t sell.  I am keeping it long term because I think it’s a $20+ stock in the future easy.  That’s all based on research and DD.  So why would I sell at $8 if I think it will go to $20.  Sure the stock cooled off and is now in the $5 range, but again… I don’t sweat it.  It’s worth more to me.

Point is, always have what you consider and exit point.  Also notating that your exit point can change based on the company changing.  A company expands their business, then maybe your exit orice increases.  Etc.

393,DTE," This option purchased on 6/24 had an expiration date for 8/20.

You have the right idea.

1. Sweet spot to buy: when the current stock price is just outside the strike price (240c) and on it’s way to exceed.

2. Ideally you want to choose a date that is really far out because you have more time to get in the money and continue growing it.

3. The above two points lie on spectrums so depending on the combination of DTE and how far out you are from the strike price, will determine how much money you need upfront to play it; which that value turns into your equity and that will fluctuate in value until you trade it back.

4. Sweet spot to sell: your equity will diminish quickly when it comes to one month from expiring. So plan on selling the option back sometime before that and when the stock price is at a peak.

394,AAPL," Yes, these points are what I am trying to juggle with small capital to begin with. I know about LEAPS and that is my ultimate goal. But the premiums are too high for me right now. I'm looking at this as a sandbox / tryout time.

So if I can, I'll grab just a bit ITM, maybe with a strike still above the underlying price. I believe this is what you are saying with point 1.

Yesterday AM I grabbed 144c AAPL for 7/23... was up $110 during day but waited too long sold today for +$20. This is my first experience of theta, I think. Lesson learned.

For point 2 - Yes, for example I like $F and want to grab these cheap options in DEC/JAN22. But frankly hoping to make a little more dough in near term; which is why your post caught my attention.

There's a low prices on TGT 8/13 u/260c. I know it's lower because earnings follow this. But I might grab that as my first longer play. Thanks again!",croquet_player,1,/r/stocks/comments/oow6mb/made_62_roi_in_about_25_weeks_from_one_trade/h61u9z9/,0.041,0.84,0.119,0.9305

397,TSLA, Stock and company are two totally different things. You can love the company and its products but hate the stock. For example I love Apple and their products but I am 100% not buying their stock right now. Currently TSLA is trading at insane valuations that I would never touch. But hey since driving Tesla makes you want to all of sudden buy Tesla stock now than go for it. You do you.
