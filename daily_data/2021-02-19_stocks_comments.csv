I'm going to leave this up because OP is correct and seeing all of the panicky posts we got after 3 down days in a row was honestly disappointing. The market was down less than 2% from the ATH after those 3 days and yet we still had dozens, if not hundreds, of people posting about whether or not they should sell.

BUT! In my, risk assessment they are far less risky than being in the SP-500 fund or a lot of these other legacy ETF's. Why? Deep value. There are tons of companies in these funds that are going to provide deep fucking value in the future and will take over. Massive disuption is happening in so many industries.

Think about how many legacy energy, oil, automaker...ect companies there are  in the top 50 of the SP500. 40-50% of those companies will not be in that spot in 2030. Why would I expose myself to their losses and shitty outlook on the future trying to do the same thing over and over again? No thanks.

I think the Covid vaccines are a great example of this. MRNA vaccines have been worked on since the mid 90s and only now (albeit in a time of need) do we have working MRNA vaccines at low costs. 3D printing and genome editing are the same way.

when I first started Tesla was at 500, at first I thought that's how stocks run, not based on the current value but future. not until i learn the basics, i found out that tesla is grossly overvalues and evidently that's what the market is now.

so, sometimes, i read comments, articles and they contradict each other and go against the fundamentals. I don't understand, no matter how many times I google or read the term definitions, so questions are asked. questions that to more experienced investors sound silly.

147,EV," Clii: I’ve been watching this for a while. It seems it went red hot in its first week and has been on a steady decline. I simply cannot figure out why? I’m tempted to buy in for the following reasons:
1) fast charge seems to be the superior option for EV owners.
2) CLii has existing chargers and some favorable agreements. 
3) It seems like a value EV charge play at 18 vs. others 40+
4) receiving grants and adding stations

Reasons I’m afraid to buy:
1) ticker name... why is it not EVGO already? 
2) Cramer and other pump chumps are touting other companies(EV Box/ Blink) in this space and the momentum is seemingly following this troglodyte. 
3) This is such an obvious play that is not moving which leads me to believe there is information that I am missing. 
4) lawsuit/investigation into merger.
5) lack of real information to justify a position

155,JD," Yes, they are making huge inroads into next gen farm tech. Look at blue river, they bought it. 

This JD boom is due to two reasons: big boom in hobby farmers (think small tractors and lawnmowers) and big ag being very reliant on high tech tractors. Especially with the roundup controversy

157,BK," One of the things that newbies have not yet learned is in a bear market (not saying we are there yet at all, but learn this trick) you don't buy dips you sell rallies.   In a Bull market, which we are still in, you buy dips and don't sell rallies.   But you need to be sensitive to when you need to make that change and a 20% drop isn't necessary the time, unless you want to lose 20% of your investments.

If the stock goes past that break even point I make some money and if it does a Tesla blast off I don't get left behind.

If it expires worthless I have lost what I paid for those options. I am willing to accept that loss as it is, in total, less than one percent of what I already made with NIO so I'm well into the green even if I take that hit. I consider this my FOMO tax.

358,ALL," This is not a stupid question. This is a fantastic question, and it’s great that you asked it.

ETFs are collections of stocks assembled together in a single fund with different strategies. They can be built on the same concepts as mutual funds—however—they trade like stocks, so you buy them in shares. With fractional shares now you can buy any dollar value of them.

There are different types, but the core distinction is indexing versus actively managed. An index is “passively managed” and has very, very low fees. The fund seeks to track the performance of a specific index like the s&p500. This is very valuable, as the s&p500 has grown around 9.7% on average over the last century.

The very traditional investment advice, which still beats 90%+ of investment strategies, is to buy an s&p500 index fund with a very low cost ratio, and consistently add to it every month through good times and bad. By doing so you “dollar cost average” the money you put it, buying high and low, and maximize returns over time.

Warren Buffett actually placed a $1m bet in 2008 that 10 hedge funds picked by Protege Partners LLC wouldn’t beat the vanguard s&p500 index fund over 10 years. The managers picked the 10 hedge funds they thought were best suited to outperform, and ALL of them fell short of the vanguard s&p500 ETF (ticker VOO).

Now I feel I'm over-invested  into that market with companies and wouldn't mind selling a few to  invest elsewhere (want to DD and start investing in green energy and  real estate).

I'm not too worried  on losses, as I have a very low stake in all of them. Any of these you  feel does not have the growth future that we all hope the industry will  explode into?

It is also true that most stocks that are recommended on WSB and here are super high valuation stocks. These super expensive stocks will go down way more than the average market will. PLTR is a freaking expensive stock looking at their P/S and estimated sales for 2021. Until recently nobody cared about valuations but these days will come to an end. Btw Cathy Wood's funds also don't care about valuations at all. She would still buy them if she believes they will have a great future but her funds will also greatly suffer (much more than average market) if there is a more persistent selloff. I would love to see the average P/S ratio (measurement for high growth companies) of her funds.

567,PLTR," I mean the lock up period for PLTR had ended and there’s been a massive sell off, but ARK is buying it aggressively, so I would think that most of the anxiety around the stock should be wearing off. For me, PLTR was always a long term play, so a 5% or 10% correction doesn’t really hurt me too badly because my cost basis is around $14. It stings, yeah, but I’m still up 80% so it’s like, on days like this i just make a point to not even look at my portfolio. 

As for traders, god bless em. I hope they all make a million dollars, I really do. The thing for me is just that I’m a little older than a lot of these guys and I have a family to take care of, so the $50 or $100 I deposit from my check every week is what I have left over to invest after the bills are paid. It’s literally the proverbial “money I can afford to lose”. There’s private school and car insurance to pay for, so I can’t fuck around playing with margin and maybe ending up eating shit on an investment. 

Plus, I just know my own limits. I’m too stupid to understand puts and call options and theta and all that. I understand simple things like “the future of society will see less physical cash and more digital payments” so I buy ARKF. “Ten years from now there will be more microchips in more gadgets than there are today” so I buy the SMH.

579,AAPL," its an excellent question and something that nobody really knows. and those who do pretend to know also do not know. 

one analyst claims a stock is worth 10freedom coins, another claims its at least 100 bucks the very next day. 

whatever floats their boat, fits their agenda or their personal opinion about whatever topic.

some base it on ""projected trajectory"" or whatever they claim to be highly sophisticated models - yet it is their excuse for trying to predict the future. 

I wouldn´t concentrate on fair value.   
I would ask myself four main questions: 

\- is the company managed well ? this is rather complex in nature as it also asnwers qquestions about being able to pivot , change and adapt well to changing environments.  
it allows to project past and present managerial behavior into the future. if a company navigated through rough times and phases before, it probably will be able to do so again. 

  
\- does the company have a good, sustainable business model?   
this also is a rather complex question, yet it answers if there is room for growth, if it keeps clients or suffers too much churn, is needed or regarded as worthwhile. 

\- whatever the company does, how does it scale?  
if  a business model purely relies on aquiering more and more customers, it is bound to hit walls in regards to growth. it is the main reason companies like AAPL, MSFT and others switched their models around. yet even for those business models, their will be eventuall walls in regards to scaling. 

\- how is the company seen and valued by society? is this going to change ?  
this is the last question and again, fairly complex. it´s also - imho - the hardest question to answer, as nobody can be sure how society, morals and values might change. one can only see current trends and come to a conclusion.

586,DCF," There's many theories. The DCF, net-net, and even tangible book value has been used by some to gauge a company fair price.
Currently Im studying more into the tangible book value per share. What it does is a calculation if the company were to go bankrupt and all assets liquidated. Say a company market price is at 10$ per share. While the tangible book value per share is at 20$. It could indicate that the company currently trade below its fair value and it could be a bargain buy.

The catch is, sometimes what seems as good assets in the company book may not necesarrily a real good assets. For example, a car rental company assets may be not as good as it seems, since car will depreciate much faster than other asset types. So in that case, the TBVPS calculation may actually not as good as it seems.",Zizinho16,1,/r/stocks/comments/lnb2nw/how_does_one_calculate_a_fair_value_for_a_stock/go0iro2/,0.021,0.723,0.256,0.9847
587,DCF," The intrinsic value of any asset is  the cash flows of that asset discounted at a rate that reflects a risk premium you are taking on by owning that asset (read up on the Capital Asset Pricing Model to understand this better).  This is the way the greatest investors in history have looked at things- Graham and Dodd, Buffett and Munger, Marks, Lynch, Klarman etc.  The list goes on.  Don't let anyone ever tell you that ""intrinsic value"" investing is dead.  It never will be- and it can be applied to any asset- stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.  Intrinsic value investing is not only applicable to traditional ""value"" stocks (IBM, T, INTC, etc.), although it does work better when the cash flows of the business are more predictable.  What I'm trying to say is that you can try to calculate intrinsic value of a growth stock- but it will be much harder because usually these companies are not profitable, and you will have to not only predict revenue growth (basically how much they are able to scale) but also the gross, operating, and net margin improvement they will need to experience to get to a point where they are cash flow positive.  You will likely want to use a larger discount factor/risk premium (maybe 15, 20, 25, or even 30%) for these types of companies because the degree of uncertainty is much larger, therefore you should require a higher rate of return if you want to make these types of investments.

People say discounted cash flow valuation is challenging, but it really doesn't have to be. It is also only one piece of the puzzle you should think about when making investment decisions.  You should also be focusing on company quality (whether that's looking at a company's balance sheet, financial trends over time, consumer reports, product pipeline, intellectual property and moat, etc.) as well as the macroeconomic environment in which that company operates (competitors, future outlook for markets the company operates in, other macroeconomic factors, etc.)

DCF can be very complex if you choose to make it so, but it can also be simplified.  While you should take a simple DCF with a grain of salt, it can still be a decent compass in terms of value.  Nobody can accurately predict the future, but what you can do is project aggressive and conservative scenarios for any given asset and understand how well something could perform in those different scenarios.  Getting a range of values is helpful- the true value likely lies somewhere in between these ""hell is freezing over"" and ""blue sky"" scenarios.  If in your conservative scenario you determine that the intrinsic value of a stock, for instance, is higher than the current share price, then you have discovered a ""margin of safety.""  This margin of safety will not only help you in bull markets (because you believe there is significant upside to that security), but it will also protect against further downside risk (if it's cheap already, it's likely to become less cheap than other securities that are fairly or overvalued).  Seth Klarman's ""Margin of Safety"" is an amazing read and I highly recommend it. You can find PDFs of it on the internet because its no longer in print.

$LMT - Come get your tendies!

I’m currently holding 250 shares and hoping to add a lot more on dips prior to the 1/26 earnings.  Here’s why:

1) 🚀
2) 95b market cap with 143b in backlogged orders pending fulfillment. About 17b gross revenue per quarter and about 2b in net profits 
3) Clean balance sheet.  Extremely low debt compared to the rest of the competitors in the defense sector 
4) Defense budget will only increase over time.  Bad sentiment on the defense budget is what’s dragging the stock down right now
5) LMT created 5G satellites and leverages 5g within its products.  They already began filing patents for 6G
6) VALUE. The current stock price is a bargain at these levels.  Trading at 14x PE which is cheap. 
7) ARK has been buying this month and adding LMT to their ETF
7) Acquisition of Aerojet Rocketdyne

So in summary....buy the dip, put on your space suit, pack some tendies, and meet me on the moon 🚀🚀🚀

While not the most in depth DD ever it brought up some solid points and is purely an earnings play to me, even if I am pondering a leap the more I dig.

My thoughts are on some “weeklies” tomorrow first thing and hold till the bitter end expecting a run up in prep for earnings. Nothing extreme so maybe the $345 or $350. If the real Wall Street is expecting a beat here and since the stock has been on the decline plus today was within 2% of the 6mo low... I’m tempted this could be a shock and awe.

If the stock starts to tank near the end of the day (like 3:45) I’ll buy the dip in prep for Tuesday but look at March 19 Calls, covers Dividend time. 

The special dude over at WSB had the acquisition of Aerojet Rocketdyne listed at #8 it is much much more significant than that. 

Patents on 6G and already using 5G a ton... none of this is small scale stuff. 

Then there is the whole ARK convo... with ARKX coming on... and if they mirror the fund they have in Japan, this will be included. Trying to find the link/post from in here that had all the info, will update.

If you look at the holdings, the 6th largest, this stock. Then if you go to page 2 you’ll see the company that this one is buying out as the 28th on the list. Hmmmmmmm.

- Their PT of is not $40 - I believe they had 3nr PTs from $30-$40 until last week, when Morgan Stanley gave them a PT of just $12 - this helped accelerate the share price down to where it is now


- at the time of merger (dec-20 ish), they had $544m of committed revenue and ""up to"" $2.2bn in advance negotiations. I'm very skeptical about the latter, as SPACs tend to exaggerate future revenue massively. The committed revenue includes a 5yr $234m deal with lion eletric


- they don't actually make battery cells - they take other people's cells and use engineering and tech to enhance performance and density - the overall density is some of the best in the industry


- BorgWarner owns 15%, and the two firms have a JV to target NA and Europe, focusing on fleets of trucks, vans, etc. They do mention light EVs too, but it's not a focus.  I was extremely bullish because of the JV, but BorgWarner just bought Akasol - a ""German developer and manufacturer of customizable lithium-ion battery systems for use in buses (including Mercedes-Benz eCitaro), commercial vehicles, rail vehicles and industrial vehicles, as well as in ships and boats."".  Not sure how this will work now, but for me, it dilutes the power of the JV.

- general concern raised by Morgan Stanley was whether RMO can compete without making their own cells. I don't see why not, but there's going to be a lot of competition


- RMO announced this week that they're redeeming all public issue warrants - I'm new to all this, so not up to speed to the technicalities, but it's also driven the share price down


- General comms. and PR from RMO has been diabolical throughout. The CEO has sort of acknowledged this and accepted the challenge of doing better.


- There have been no new accouncements other than the Republic Service announcement since merger (everything else was actually confirmed pre merger, just rehashed on twitter more recently). The Republic Service deal so far only has retro fit of two dumpster trucks (pretty disappointing as their only new contract so far)


- Earnings and formal update is expected sometime in March but tbc. 


There's a good chance this will dip down further after the Morgan Stanley PT of $12, especially if we have more red days. Would suggest averaging in if investing.

- Their PT of is not $40 - I believe they had 3nr PTs from $30-$40 until last week, when Morgan Stanley gave them a PT of just $12 - this helped accelerate the share price down to where it is now


- at the time of merger (dec-20 ish), they had $544m of committed revenue and ""up to"" $2.2bn in advance negotiations. I'm very skeptical about the latter, as SPACs tend to exaggerate future revenue massively. The committed revenue includes a 5yr $234m deal with lion eletric


- they don't actually make battery cells - they take other people's cells and use engineering and tech to enhance performance and density - the overall density is some of the best in the industry


- BorgWarner owns 15%, and the two firms have a JV to target NA and Europe, focusing on fleets of trucks, vans, etc. They do mention light EVs too, but it's not a focus.  I was extremely bullish because of the JV, but BorgWarner just bought Akasol - a ""German developer and manufacturer of customizable lithium-ion battery systems for use in buses (including Mercedes-Benz eCitaro), commercial vehicles, rail vehicles and industrial vehicles, as well as in ships and boats."".  Not sure how this will work now, but for me, it dilutes the power of the JV.

- general concern raised by Morgan Stanley was whether RMO can compete without making their own cells. I don't see why not, but there's going to be a lot of competition


- RMO announced this week that they're redeeming all public issue warrants - I'm new to all this, so not up to speed to the technicalities, but it's also driven the share price down


- General comms. and PR from RMO has been diabolical throughout. The CEO has sort of acknowledged this and accepted the challenge of doing better.


- There have been no new accouncements other than the Republic Service announcement since merger (everything else was actually confirmed pre merger, just rehashed on twitter more recently). The Republic Service deal so far only has retro fit of two dumpster trucks (pretty disappointing as their only new contract so far)


- Earnings and formal update is expected sometime in March but tbc. 


There's a good chance this will dip down further after the Morgan Stanley PT of $12, especially if we have more red days. Would suggest averaging in if investing.

630,UK," I can’t speak for the UK but in the US you have to be an accredited investor to gain access to pre-IPO pricing. An accredited investor has to have an income of $200k/year or over a million dollar net worth I believe. Before it was an annual income of one million dollars but I think that recently changed. 

The caveat is the lockup period - https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ipolockup.asp

631,BMBL," E*TRADE does send notices for participating in IPO before it hits the exchanges.  If you’re account is large enough & your broker is participating in the IPO, they’ll give you notice about buying in the offering at the listed price. But no guarantees even if you request to participate as I learned myself with the BMBL IPO.",scallion11,3,/r/stocks/comments/lnf7fb/how_can_i_buy_shares_on_the_day_of_an_ipo_for_the/go0bo4i/,0.039,0.961,0.0,-0.296
632,HL," In the U.K., the HL app allows you to enter your interested in an IPO and buy as soon as it’s listed (from what I can remember).
I did this with Aston Martin and the stock plummeted as the initial listing price was too high (I was inexperience)",jamesfromtheuk,4,/r/stocks/comments/lnf7fb/how_can_i_buy_shares_on_the_day_of_an_ipo_for_the/go02ed9/,0.0,0.943,0.057,0.4019
633,DKNG," The big question is WHY you want to participate in IPOs. If it is because you want to be in at the ground floor of the next big LONG TERM investment, well, then wait a little because the price will almost always retreat.

If you don't really care long term but are just jonesing for that big cheesy IPO pop, well you aren't going to be allowed in that club. But there are other investment vehicles where you can get it (see for instance how DKNG went public), even if less consistently. If you are smart about it, your misses will mainly be opportunity cost, and your hits will give you what you are looking for.",draw2discard2,1,/r/stocks/comments/lnf7fb/how_can_i_buy_shares_on_the_day_of_an_ipo_for_the/go1ivpc/,0.034,0.846,0.12,0.8289
634,TD," There's the app ClickIPO which allows access to some IPOs. I use it through TradeStation. But since IPOs listed are limited I haven't jumped on any yet, none were of interest. Otherwise based on requirements of your broker. For example.. TD Ameritrade requires $250,000 in funds or more or 30 plus trades in a month.. something like that. And others are similar or more difficult. And just because you may meet their requirements they could put you in a negative rating if selling an IPO with-in a month. Short term investing, less than a month, is frowned upon by brokerages and end up giving you negative ratings which in-turn reduce the amount of IPOs that'd be available to you.

So first off get about a quarter million$$, based on requirements, for investments and request access to IPOs through your broker.

Or play around with ClickIPO, like me, and hope for access to a good IPO sooner or later.

Or follow S P A Cs and jump on some of those with the hopes of them partnering with a big company, such as Lucid. But make certain aware of all the S P A C agreement guidelines. Such as owners only receiving 10% of the merged company stock or something similar. Lots of hype around some S P A Cs and they are similar to an IPO with a little more risk.",DwnWthTheSystem,1,/r/stocks/comments/lnf7fb/how_can_i_buy_shares_on_the_day_of_an_ipo_for_the/go1jfsq/,0.071,0.829,0.1,0.7195

636,GME," Money talks, bullshit walks. Whatever syndicate is marketing the offering usually, but not always, is bearing the price risk until those shares actually start trading. Makes sense they'd want to de-risk/unload as much volume as possible. 

Also, doing any sort of roadshow marketing would be nigh impossible.

And income/wealth thresholds exist with respect to purchasing securities that haven't been registered under the '33 and '34 act - to protect individuals from losing their shirt by engaging in risky transactions that (a) they don't understand and more importantly (b) that will destroy years of hardwork and savings because their pupils have turned into dollar signs. 


If you need to ask *why*, just go look at the article in the journal this week about the guy on /r/WSB who thought it was a good idea to dump his entire life savings into GME when it was trading at $350......",trill_collins__,1,/r/stocks/comments/lnf7fb/how_can_i_buy_shares_on_the_day_of_an_ipo_for_the/go0l01a/,0.108,0.75,0.143,0.7302
637,GME," You are beyond dumb- same investors can buy any penny stock scam pump and dump they want on a app that makes slot machine sounds yet cannot get IPOs of companies that are sure bets?   
Why does everyone who understands rules and regulations choke on on the laws dong ? Yes that is the rule- is the rule good? No its terrible and  guise to keep people from buying stuff that rich people want to hold for themselves and manipulate.  

Your GME argument is a laugh too because the people who put in their life savings at 350 were correct to do so as it would have hit 1k if it didnt get shut down by these same chodes you are defrending. What prevents anyone from buying a dumb stock at its peak- or a penny stock at its peak- does rule 69, and 420  say once you know the rules you cinderella turn into an upright bitch with a rod coming out your mouth, spewing the cum of rules on poor people who think the rules are shit?",Ranch_Chodenian,1,/r/stocks/comments/lnf7fb/how_can_i_buy_shares_on_the_day_of_an_ipo_for_the/go0lsna/,0.171,0.738,0.091,-0.9621

650,CVS," Amazon is just an online bookstore. 

Walmart is moving into some form of banking and some form of healthcare (like CVS and others want to do). 

Grocery pickup or delivery is huge for me. And their prices are low. I’ve tried a lot of their Great Value stuff (chips, tomato products, different beans, mozzarella cheese, etc) and they are all fine at 1/2 the cost. 

I still prefer Cracker Barrel Extra Sharp Cheddar Cheese because I do. And I pay less for it. Thomas’s English Muffins are exactly that and I pay less. 

Hunts tomato paste 6oz is $0.72. Great Value is $0.42. Walmart doesn’t make tomato paste. Hunts probably does. 

Miller Lite is $15.98 for a case. It’s actually Miller Lite. 

A 12 pack of Guinness Extra Stout is $17.98. 

If you order the Great Value Kettle cooked Jalapeño potato chips ($1.33) and they are out so you you get a bigger bag of Lay Kettle cooked (a $3.98 value) for $1.33. I feel like I’m sticking it to the man. 

Their hamburger is fine and maybe a Chuck Roast but I wouldn’t order a NY Strip. 

And you click a button and they drive it to you and put it in the garage at the time you request. 

I haven’t been to a grocery store in over 1.5 years. 

I never but Oreo’s because I never see them. They do have the thin mint cookies (like the Girl Scouts) for $0.98. Walmart doesn’t make cookies. 

They don’t make flour either. King Arthur All purpose 5 pounds is $3.68. Great Value is $1.22. I make pizza and bagels and bread. I can’t tell the difference. 

Philly Cream cheese is $1.96. Great Value is $1.62 but you get 2. Walmart doesn’t make cream cheese.

664,HII," Last year I posted about a defense stock, Huntington Ingalls, which is a shipbuilder that builds submarines. They have an amazing 10 year backlog of contracts, a wide moat and everything else lined up. But their stock wasn't recovering from pandemic lows much. At the time I posted about it last year, it was about $160/$270 of its pre-pandemic share value, for no reason. But it never really recovered, bouncing in a narrow range for months. 

[In the past 10 days, HII has outperformed TSLA by 17%.](https://imgur.com/SimoEzj) So HII is one stock that I'm calling a value stock, that was previously stagnating, that has turned into a growth stock as some investors rotate from growth to value. I don't know how long the rotation into value will continue (how many days) but until then, I expect HII to do well. 

I actually deleted my watchlist of value stocks that were stagnating, because it wasn't doing anything. HII is just one stock I recall off the top of my head. Other stocks that have been doing well in the past 10 days that usually don't do so well include Exxon Mobile (XOM). [XOM has beaten TSLA by 15% in the past 10 days.](https://imgur.com/orzNXP7). Since neither XOM nor HII are near their pre-pandemic highs, one thing I'll be looking at tomorrow is whether it looks like these value stocks will run another 10%-20% in the next week. I might even finally pick up some Berkshire Hathaway, as that has even started to move.

667,UK," Thanks for the reply. My broker is Interactive Brokers for options trading but the Trader Workstation is clunky and the watchlists aren't particularly user friendly. I'm not subscribed to the premium data feed packages, so I don't think I'm getting real time pricing.

I use Trading 212 for my investments. I'm based in the UK. I've got several watchlists set up in Yahoo Finance (I've got, for example, a list of potential 'buys' for my investment account, and then designated sector lists like uranium). I generally keep abreast of the prices and then sort them by the day percentage change, but the sort feature doesn't seem to work particularly well in Yahoo Finance.

The best thing I have at the moment for real time pricing is an IOS app called My Stocks. The pricing information seems to be very real time. I've also got watchlists set up in that app.

I'm relatively new to trading and I'm interested in investing based on macro trends (picking individual stocks in my tax free investment account), and also selling options (mainly cash secured puts).

I'm not averse to paying for FinViz's elite package. I think I will look into it.",chris_g17,1,/r/stocks/comments/lmy9fe/whats_causing_the_stock_dump_how_it_impacts_the/go0g3ox/,0.018,0.861,0.121,0.9716

699,IMO," Just be very careful. Options are not a rookies game and you went straight in with a daily and then a weekly after that. The highest risk, basically. I don’t mean to condescend but the fact the you immediately went to buying short term options suggests to me that you didn’t do enough research in your ‘few weeks’ to understand the risks adequately. 

I may be very wrong, you may understand the various risks, but risking money when you’re unemployed on short term options with the little information you could possibly have picked up in two weeks is not sensible. Not even just IMO, it’s just not a good idea. Paper trade for a while first?

785,SE," Okay let me help you out here because you seem to be misunderstanding P/E ratio. 

Sea Limited’s gross profit for the past year is $1.08B. Instead of distributing those profits to shareholders, they take those profits and use them for R&D, expansion, buying businesses, etc. Because of that decision, they post a negative net income, making them unprofitable. SE’s P/E ratio is infinite (or undefined) because their net income is negative.

I also don’t understand why a company that’s reinvesting it profits would have a low price to sales ratio? The reason the P/S is relatively high on a company like SE is because their revenue growth is so high. YoY revenue growth is *over* 100% for three years in a row meaning that their P/S ratio (if share price remained constant), would be cut in half in just a year’s time.

Extremely high revenue growth and a long runway allows for companies to reach high P/S ratios because they grow into them. Also, their P/S ratio is not all that high. We’re talking about ~15x forward sales? High for sure, but there are plenty of companies fetching 50-100x forward sales.",aybabay5,7,/r/stocks/comments/ln0ako/why_does_no_one_talk_about_sea_limited_se/gny75hi/,0.059,0.826,0.115,0.7319
786,WMT," I’m not mistaking P/E and P/S I laid them out perfectly in my previous comment.

Using a general rule of thumb for P/S as a valuation metric is a bad idea because different companies are in different stages with different prospects. 2x P/S would be a high valuation for a company like WMT because they have very low revenue growth and don’t have many opportunities to grow.

The reason growth companies command higher P/S ratios is obvious - they’re growing sales at a much higher rate.

Amazon has had a high P/S forever, and even now their P/S is around 5 despite being a more mature company with limited growth opportunities.",aybabay5,3,/r/stocks/comments/ln0ako/why_does_no_one_talk_about_sea_limited_se/gnyfymv/,0.084,0.69,0.226,0.9389

818,AGNC," the main problem I see is this: if you want to grow total worth of portfolio assets, most ""safe"" or stable dividend yields not even come close to S&P average retrurn per year. also those stable companies are not necessarily the companies that also provide the annual growth companies without dividends seem to achieve. there are exceptions, but the company that has great growth in stock value, plus a really good yield of dividends is an extremely rare breed indeed.   


in the current makrt situation I personally feel that   
energy / oil stocks offer both. and the growth is only possible because the massive dip they all suffered at the start of the pandemic. but if you really want both, this is - at least for the next 6 -12 months, maybe a golden opportunity to get massive growth in stock prices , and get very generous dividends at the same time.   
eg. 

EXXON, ONEOK, TOTAL,  etc. they all followed the basic trajectory of stock price and pay out dividends of 6-8 %, which is very good. and they all are probably going to recover a lot once industry and world markets recover as well.   


another opportunity I see is REITS. great yields and stock prices suffered because the real estate market was struggling because of lockdowns etc.    
Armour residential, AGNC, Chimera Investment all made the same dip during begin of the pandemic. all still maintained their dividends north of 10% and are probably rebounding to better stock prices once pandemic revovery is on the way.

822,GE," I concur. These breathless DDs seem to neglect that there is competition in this space from the likes of massive companies like GE Healthcare, Siemens, Samsung, Philips, etc., who have sort of neglected this market (ultra-portable ultrasound systems) due to the relatively small money involved with ultrasound. Right now the company is valued at 25x revenue, or a quarter of the entire global ultrasound market. I've read some wild PTs of 5-year valuations of $40 billion. That's never going to happen when the main selling point is cost and it's something that gets purchased once. And the investor presentations are laughable. ""AI"" is not going to make these devices usable at home for laypeople like a thermometer. 

Absent a sea change in how diagnostic testing is billed and regulated these units will not replace existing machines or ultrasound departments and the radiologists who interpret and supervise them. They will make big inroads in specific, narrow types of POCUS exams and interventional procesures that are already being done in most ERs, ICUs, and cath labs.

I'm still in @~$16 because I think hype can carry this for a while but GE and Siemens are going to eat into their market share - they can throw in dozens of similar products that perform adequately for the intended use when a hospital or imaging center is going to spend millions of dollars on an MRI or CT suite.",totallynotabotAF,2,/r/stocks/comments/lnnh6y/will_this_butterfly_bfly_take_off/go1igxl/,0.019,0.934,0.048,0.5998

Now if you only make a trade or two in big US names, DeGiro is fine ( I'd look into FirsTrade instead though, also zero commission and has US options and a lot of the smaller exchanges for OTC stuff – and their platform while not very up-to-date is still better than DeGiro ).

Choices are limited as an international investor, but if you want to actually trade actively and globally, go IBKR. If fees and US markets are your focus, FirsTrade or TastyWorks.

922,CSCO," I like Mastercard, but I bought it early before a split so it's done especially well for me over the years.  Comcast.  I've bought and then reinvested in that one a few times.  IIPR.  Bought that one as a pink sheet, against my financial advisor's advice, and it's increased almost 1100% in the four years I've had it.  I actually have that one set to reinvest since it's so amazing.  Union Pacific has been solid.  My most recent purchase was CSCO.  My husband likes AT&T.  The stock itself hasn't done much - we're pretty much where we were at when we first bought it 4-5 years ago- but the dividend is over 7% so it's a consistent income regardless.  Similar story with Altria.",JessicaRabbit05661,1,/r/stocks/comments/lnbt5c/question_about_aapl_dividend/go05sxv/,0.0,0.817,0.183,0.9755

925,RH," What I hear OP saying is that they want to use their brokerage as a SAVINGS, which I agree is a good place to be, as long as you understand the risks involved in that.  Banks guarantee your money will still be there in a year.  The trade-off is crap interest rates.  With dividend stocks you have the risk of your nest-egg getting wiped out, but the trade-off is awesome income potential.  I have a regular savings account too.  Also 401K, which you can draw against in a pinch.  Several brokerage accounts and IRAs, spread between a couple different brokers.  Big fan of diversification.  I guess I don't really trust anybody ...  Just look at this shit RH has been pulling.",JessicaRabbit05661,1,/r/stocks/comments/lnbt5c/question_about_aapl_dividend/go097mq/,0.113,0.756,0.131,0.0764

Diversifying is important with investments. But why people keep opening multiple broker accounts is not what people mean when saying to diversify investments. Just don't use some shitty app like RH. Use a large broker like Fidelity or Schwab or TDA and have multiple accounts there.",seattle-random,1,/r/stocks/comments/lnbt5c/question_about_aapl_dividend/go147vl/,0.0,0.861,0.139,0.8813
