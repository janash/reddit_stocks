Same day delivery (reusing their retail store locations as distribution centres)

NFT possibility of introducing the resale of digital products - nobody has done this yet
( https://nft.gamestop.com/ a tease)

International presence (and currently insane free marketing)

Ryan Cohen reputation for customer service and subsequent loyalty from them

 Whole new team of ex-Amazon and Chewy heads

Recently debt-free

(Probably some other things Imd be missing)

Edit1: want to add more another thought on the NFT potential.

Currently as a customer of Steam/Epic you own your game and can play it through their store/app. You own the product as long as they exist.

By making the digital games unique you will be the owner of the game/installation. But GoG already does this! Yes, but thats because their store is drm-free. Block-chain could achieve ownership and solve the issue with piracy.

Edit2: addressing concerns over commercial properties owned by gamestop when they’re going digital:

There is a demo location (I don’t have the link for it on hand) where a gamestop location is used as a gaming hub. LAN + couch gaming, tabletop gaming (dnd, pokemon, etc)

1,GME," Just a couple of thoughts from the top of my head (I'm long GME):

\- Brand recognition: if you are going to enter the eCommerce game, provide a new service or disrupt an existing one, one of the biggest hurdles you'll face is getting your brand name recognized. Becoming a household name takes time, but GameStop has that in the bag already. Big time. If I had more venture capital, I'd be going in balls deep.

\- Existing customer base. PowerUp Rewards members - quite a few of those.

\- Physical console sales aren't going away any time soon, and a lot of people will still buy physical discs for a long time, until Internet speeds catch up. If you live in the rural parts of America, for example, downloading games is not as easy as it sounds. Digital game market needs a specific incentive to buy from a middle man, but I see GS taking steps into certain directions that make me feel confident I have a good idea what they're planning (Not sharing, but very bullish: has to do with the digital game market specifically, allowing them to incentivize most gamers everywhere to use their platform).

\- eSports and experience-driven locations. If you've ever attended a LAN party, you know the appeal. GameStop is already moving into this direction with select stores and more to follow.

\- Ryan Cohen. Yes, it doesn't say much, but if you know the man and what he has done, it speaks volumes. Also, you don't buy nine million shares of an extremely heavily shorted company without having a plan to dislodge those shorts - something's in the works.

\- New GameStop board members from Amazon, Google, Chewy etc. All accepted to be paid in GME stock. Quite frankly, I believe that the job offer from RC came with a non-disclosure agreement, and if people signed up (when the base stock price was around $180), there's something on the table that only RC and the board knows.

\- Gamer culture: if you're a gamer, you know GameStop, especially now with the worldwide attention. Gamers are their own kind of breed, and a lot of gamers, old and new, are currently in the demographic that have stable income.

\- Gaming and its market cap - video games have grown into an *insanely huge* industry whose importance only keeps growing, far surpassing books, music and movies. When the business fully transitions from the brick & mortar retailer to an eCommerce model, their market cap will have to be re-evaluated. It's going to be... different. I fully expect to see GME growing into something that far surpasses even these 'meme' prices.

\- Publicity: you can't get advertisements  better than this. The Reddit crowd 'rally' news went viral worldwide, and GME will forever be the brand associated with the little underdog duking it out with the Wall Street.

\- Debt-free company. After a few good earnings reports (which will be forthcoming due to the rabid and dedicated customer base), expect to see GME in different indices far above its current status.

And there's a lot of stuff where that came from. I have ideas where they could go, and what they could do already within a short-ish time frame. The 'meme' stock status is just a narrative if you look at the fundamentals and understand gamer culture and what type of business prospects they can muster. Couple that with new leadership, a dream-team of heavy hitters with a proven track record and I'm bullish long-term. I saw GME as a good long-term value investment (am an old gamer myself) where you could hop in on the ground floor while the price was artificially suppressed via shorting.

Finally, I don't care too much about the impending short squeeze when it comes to my *long-term* investing decisions, but I can't rule that out either. Looking at the media and the bashing GME gets, coupled with the skepticism drummed up by just about every other media outlet out there taking a paycheck from some other source than the government, it doesn't take a big brain to see they're going against the heckles of someone with big money. All the firewall rules getting passed by the DTCC tells me that Big Money players are expecting something big to happen, like maybe a few larger intermediaries getting liquidated due to large short positions. No matter what happens or when, judging by the looks of what's going on in the background behind all the artificial noise, it's going to be big. Lifetime customer base with good capital reserves guaranteed.

But yeah, I'm a gamer and I like good value when I see it. I don't mind jumping onto 'unconventional' choices and I often go against the grain here and there when I believe I have insight into things that others simply don't. I'm looking at a 3-5 year investment period, and I fully expect the (stable) share price - based on the fundamentals alone - to be closer to $1200 to $2000 in around 5 years.

4,DD," I agree with you OP and it saddens me to see that honest questions get downvoted by upset fanboys you can't simply say ""read the DD over at /superstonks"" and think that's enough. That isn't an good answer, at least it should be possible to explain what's unique about the company, what's the moat and why can't the competition beat them?  


Part is simple cultlike loyalty It's a movement not an investment, people want to ""stick it to the man"" and like the angry proletariat they ordinary people are rising up against the elite (hedgies). Another explanation would be simply loyalty to the brand, nostalgia from the days when it was truly a gamestore where you pre-ordered to get the new hot releases on midnight, where the staff were geeks who knew every detail and were happy to talk about games with you and be like a friend more then a seller.  


Last but not least is the ""moat"". It's a decent enough brand, the CEO is a guy who's got experience and at least managed to create one successful brand although, as you say OP, that was easy mode compared to this. As far as I see this topic is very much the same as Tesla or for that matter Virgin Galatic, people try to make up all kinds of different bull cases and throw out hoping some stick. For tesla it's solar/battery/self-driving/ai/bodypillows and for gamestop it's games/funkopop/digital store/console-tie in/pc part picker/digital waifus/whatever and virgin galactic it's simply space tourism/colonize mars/everyone goes literary to the moon.  


My humble analysis is that this is a store with serious issues. It's a relic of the past, when games were hard to find and geek culture was shunned/rare, today every other store sells games (especially online), geek culture is mainstream and every console has a digital storefront. As for Pc parts and all that there are already other, well established companies with loyal customers. Wherever Coen&Co tries to establish themselves they'll fight an uphill battle against established store physical and digital. Why would I go to them instead of use Steam/PSN? Wallmart or Amazon?   


  
TLDR: IT's a movement. It's a good brand/Store name. It's a proven CEO willing to try new things. Though I might be wrong",KyivComrade,28,/r/investing/comments/nw1smc/i_dont_understand_the_long_term_appeal_of_gme/h16jcmp/,0.075,0.812,0.112,0.9334
5,GME," Interesting that you undermine electronics (PC parts) and collectibles/memorabilia as these are already very popular and growing in popularity year on year. In fact I'd bet Amazon.com make most of it's sales revenues from the electronics category yet you seem to be undermining these? Anyhow, from reading up on this it looks like;

1. The physical stores are being closed down where unprofitable and converted to eSports ""gyms"" in other locations. I think this ties in nicely with the expected growth in gaming/eSports over the next few years.
2. They have recently completed the construction of a new distribution centre in Pennsylvania which is allowing them to expand. For example the [GameStop.com](https://GameStop.com) website was blocked in Europe but now access has been granted (albeit it is still showing the US site, but clearly things are being worked on).

7,GME," I'm not sold on it either.  I think for the most part it's just an attempt to keep the emotions high among the retail investors.

That said their move toward NFT's makes a lot of sense in the gaming space.  While the details remain unclear, NFTs could allow the commodification of digital assets as well as potentially allow for the resale of digital copies.  More or less NFTs allow the original creator to benefit from the secondary sale of a digital asset.  The code can be written in such a way that the originator gets x% of the transaction.  If the larger gaming companies buy into the concept, GME could capture a substantial portion of the gaming market while delivering more value to both game makers and game players.  Players might hate pay to win but they might be much more accepting of pay other players to win.  This might introduce much more acceptable monetization strategies into the full price gaming market.

That aside I'm not sure how great the moat here is.  My suspicion is that in the next decade or so we are going to see a lot of NFT/crypto projects to connect the digital world to the real one.  Some will work, most will fail (as with all new technologies).  If GME can make it work, a significantly higher valuation than most targets would generally be warranted.  But that's a big if.

10,CTO," I'm a regular person who made a little money out of GME in Feb, and otherwise has used it as a reason to understand the stock market. I've not dipped into GME otherwise.

That said I'm an avid gamer and have been a serious hobbyist about it for the last 18 odd years. Gaming is still an emerging field, and there are constantly new technologies and competitors pushing out existing giants, along with a growing and changing market.

Example: Discord taking the market away from Ventrilo, Teamspeak and Mumble, and is now considering floating. The text/game advertising part of their product was previously done by Xfire (approx 24 mill users). Discord took good parts of existing products, at an attractive price to end users (free vs paid-for for voice comms), with an easy to use interface. Many many gaming communities couldn't see a reason not to move. Now, Discord is used by all kinds of communities - see the sidebar! The company is only 6 years old.

Example: League of Legends, while not being the first MOBA style game (that was in 2003 ish), has made that kind of game, along with the esports arm, extremely popular and profitable. The net worth of the League of Legends IP alone is estimated to be $15 bill. The owners, Riot games, are estimated to be worth $25 bill ([https://www.thewealthrecord.com/celebs-bio-wiki-salary-earnings-2019-2020-2021-2022-2023-2024-2025/other/riot-games-net-worth/](https://www.thewealthrecord.com/celebs-bio-wiki-salary-earnings-2019-2020-2021-2022-2023-2024-2025/other/riot-games-net-worth/)), though owned by Tencent. The game was released in 2009. 

I don't see Cohen alone transforming the company but he wasn't the only significant appointment this year.

12,IP," I'm a regular person who made a little money out of GME in Feb, and otherwise has used it as a reason to understand the stock market. I've not dipped into GME otherwise.

That said I'm an avid gamer and have been a serious hobbyist about it for the last 18 odd years. Gaming is still an emerging field, and there are constantly new technologies and competitors pushing out existing giants, along with a growing and changing market.

Example: Discord taking the market away from Ventrilo, Teamspeak and Mumble, and is now considering floating. The text/game advertising part of their product was previously done by Xfire (approx 24 mill users). Discord took good parts of existing products, at an attractive price to end users (free vs paid-for for voice comms), with an easy to use interface. Many many gaming communities couldn't see a reason not to move. Now, Discord is used by all kinds of communities - see the sidebar! The company is only 6 years old.

Example: League of Legends, while not being the first MOBA style game (that was in 2003 ish), has made that kind of game, along with the esports arm, extremely popular and profitable. The net worth of the League of Legends IP alone is estimated to be $15 bill. The owners, Riot games, are estimated to be worth $25 bill ([https://www.thewealthrecord.com/celebs-bio-wiki-salary-earnings-2019-2020-2021-2022-2023-2024-2025/other/riot-games-net-worth/](https://www.thewealthrecord.com/celebs-bio-wiki-salary-earnings-2019-2020-2021-2022-2023-2024-2025/other/riot-games-net-worth/)), though owned by Tencent. The game was released in 2009. 

I don't see Cohen alone transforming the company but he wasn't the only significant appointment this year. They have a CTO (a new position), a SVP of Customer care and a VP of fulfillment ([https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-appoints-chief-technology-officer](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-appoints-chief-technology-officer)). In my mind that indicates a desire to reimagine what GameStop could be. 

I don't know what they will come up with. With the CTO hire I'd imagine something involving infrastructure, but I doubt it will be a store to buy games digitally. Sites like G2A have low cost game purchases covered. I'd be looking at things other people are doing alright at but is kinda not so perfect.

15,GME," An overwhelming majority of Reddit doesn't 1) actually read or 2) understand how to read quarterly reports.  GME was a dying business - what was it, 12 or 13 consecutive quarters of declining revenue and negative earnings?  But this new stock surge has 1) allowed them to clear debts *and* raise capital and 2) been incredible free advertising.

Personally I don't see anything exciting about their future prospects.  People tout their plan for a ""robust online platform and a in-person shopping experience based on providing interactive user experiences"" like that is special.  Literally every brick-and-mortar retailer has been saying that same thing for a 4-5 years now as the answer to saving their dying business.  So far those words have been meaningless for everyone who isn't Dick's Sporting Goods.

All that being said - investing in them right now is literally gambling.  Anyone saying they're investing for the long-term future is 100% lying to themselves.  If you truly were investing for their future, and set a price based on your own fundamental analysis, I don't see how anyone could value the stock at anything over $20-30.",DrewFlan,10,/r/investing/comments/nw1smc/i_dont_understand_the_long_term_appeal_of_gme/h16k0t6/,0.077,0.79,0.133,0.9101

And I'm not going to give you predictions on the squeeze, but... watch the ticker for the next month or two. The shorts are clearly battling several different FTD cycles as it is and long-term value investors are buying and holding. If the FTD 'waves' keep on hitting as they have this far (they have no way out of those), the price will grow organically on a logarithmic scale. If this continues, the price will be in the $1000 range within the year or after a few months without any squeeze. (**Edit:** this is not organic price growth, this is still the shorters battling their fails-to-deliver)

As for the squeeze itself - well... if the moves I see DTCC making are any indication, considering what type of money needs to be involved for those guys to be making moves... one share of GME, sold at the right time, may give you a fair chunk of investment capital in the future.

What's the value proposition for a game developer/publisher to cannibalize existing full price sales by allowing/supporting an NFT based digital resale market? As other people here have mentioned, they can easily capture the value customers via sales/discounts of new digital games. I suppose if Gamestop offered a smaller sale commission (maybe 10% compared to the current 30% Steam cut), and the ability for publishers to set prices/price floors, it could happen. The market becomes less attractive with that though, and nothing stops Steam/Epic/GOG/etc from matching the reduced commissions.

Option A: GME has an NFT based digital resale model, where GME and presumably the publisher, can get a cut of the resale, but the bulk goes to the previous owner.

Option B: Steam doesn't allow resale, so the publisher just puts their game on sale on Steam. They make a net new sale, and they only need to pay off Steam, not the previous owner. Not only that, but its a new sale, meaning there is potential to sell DLCs to two customers instead of one.

I honestly do not see a situation where option A is more profitable to game publishers than option B. There is next to no chance that Steam's fees are higher than the slice the reseller+GME gets.

And if the answer is ""game stop tells the publisher and the publisher acts"", then it's not really a decentralized system. Might as well have the publisher develop their own license trading system and give game stop a B2B API for negotiating trades themselves.

Finally, if it's really decentralized, shouldn't users be able to trade NFT licenses themselves (once one of them owns the NFT) without having to pass through Gamestop?

A consumer looking for Diablo III will buy Diablo III and not say, well, Path of Exile is similar, but it allows resale, so I'll go with that.

Not much doing in stock futures: Dow and S&P are flat, with Nasdaq and Russell up about 0.2%. That’s as of 0625.

It’s the third day in a row of this. Third and last, as tomorrow we finally get the long-awaited inflation report that should provide some direction. Expectations are for the CPI to come in at 4.7%, an increase from the 4.2% seen in April. You don’t need me to tell you that a 5% rise in consumer prices is a significant figure. Whether it’s transitory is another question.

We just had producer prices in China come in higher than anticipated, driven by a rise in commodity prices, though that country’s CPI is apparently below forecasts. I say ‘apparently’ because Chinese data.

The S&P remains below its all time high of May 7. Just 0.3% lower, but probably too much to make up today given the lack of catalysts.

The meme party appears to be shifting a bit. AMC was flat yesterday and is down 5% in the pre-market. Clover Health doubled yesterday and is up another 12% in the pre-market. Contextlogic gained 50% yesterday and is up another 27% at the time of this recording. Wendy’s rallied 25% yesterday. Why Wendy’s and not McDonald’s or Burger King? Beats me.

144,VG," Virgin Galactic:

Blue Origin’s New Sheppard launch coming soon is pretty big news in the space industry. Similar to SpaceX’s successful launches, if that launch is successful, it will likely move Virgin Galactic (SPCE) up a notable amount. 

Some people might think that they are competitors so shouldn’t it be the other way? But the companies have very different launch systems, and short and long term goals. Additionally, in this sector, even if they were comparable, successful launches just increase the public’s trust and support in the industry as a whole. Which is why the support for BO, VG, and SpaceX tend to move together despite BO and SpaceX being private companies.

Virgin galactic also recently had its own successful manned space launch. And with more announcements about their future launches and ramped up PR, I think it’s a pretty promising investment.

175,IRS," I wouldn't doubt it. Most firms probably don't expect to hear a 7 figure loss when they talk about figuring out debt. That's the only advice I can really give you though. Some other ideas would be to call your broker, explain your situation, and see if they can help you. I imagine they've had to deal with a similar situation, at least once. They may not be helpful though. Another idea would be to get in contact with the IRS, see if they can write off them taxes. Maybe the attorney general could help (not from US, but I think it's the attorney of the state). You might just have to look up debt lawyers/attorneys, and call each one up, and see if they can help. Ask if they can point you towards anyone, if they offer a name, add them to the list you have and continue, until you've gone through them all. After that point, I don't really know how to help you.
