176,DTE," No fuckwit, its a combination of both shares and calls. The problem isn't they're not buying shares. Its that they're stacking their calls vertically across strikes on near term dates so that as soon as theta starts ticking its driving their premiums into the ground. Premium decays, delta decays, shares that hedged the calls get sold, and a death spiral begins entirely based on simple market mechanics. Regardless if they bought shares or not, the downward pressure of their short term calls expiring would kill them either way.

The way they fix this is buying short term ATM calls, as well as a mix of strikes further out. For example, 12 DTE WISH 12c, then August 14c, then October 16c or 20c. Then they back the calls with some shares. The market makers will provide the fuel to lever the stock up buying shares. The value investors hold the shares, and as the calls approach 1 delta, cash out a percentage to cover the cost of the calls and exercise the rest. The exercise moves the shares from the market makers to value investors, and then you pump the stock again with more call buying at new short term ATM options.",BackgroundSearch30,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oclvip/wish_for_constipation_to_go_away/h3xi567/,0.104,0.765,0.13,0.2313

The world hates nuclear power because oOo MaH mElTdOwN. For nuclear power to become a thing again governments, activist, and companies involved have to convince the world that nuc power is safe.

The world hates nuclear power because oOo MaH mElTdOwN. For nuclear power to become a thing again governments, activist, and companies involved have to convince the world that nuc power is safe. And that is not happening with uranium based reactors with designs from the 60s. Newer designs are focused on alternatives such as thorium.
