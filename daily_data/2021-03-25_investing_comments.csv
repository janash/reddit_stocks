The thing is that the options they bought we’re considerably OTM which means that 3.4B worth of premium would buy them a whole lot more contracts and, consequently, an even bigger exposure to the market. That’s the main problem. Many people involved in SB operations where getting uncomfortable with the risk they were taking in  because it was getting harder and harder to manage due to the sheer size of they’re exposure. When they were finally ousted as the whale buying all those options, everyone dumped on them, but at the time I believe that they had already liquidated their positions. 

The bet paid off. But that’s only because people start to notice when there’s large inflows into a stock/option and they start pilling in and making the price rise.

35,GME," Yeah I mean there’s some combination of organic longs, short covering, and MM hedging of calls that drove GME up, but that isn’t really illegal or whatever.  Market manipulation requires the deliberate attempt to impact the free flow of markets with the intent of moving a stock price up or down, there are some qualifiers for “social harm” too. 

The legalities can get pretty in the weeds pretty fast, so like a super high surface level one could say that if a bunch of people decide they think a stock is going to go up and they buy calls, forcing a MM to hedge out the exposure which pushes up the stock then that’s just a result of market mechanics.  If a single or coordinated group of large buyers decides to purchase calls with the intent of driving the price up specifically because of said hedging then that’s market manipulation.

79,ICE," You haven’t done the research. Legacy auto companies have virtually no growth, need to do a costly transition to EVs that is close to zero sum (EV sale replaces ICE sale), have tons of legacy costs and debt, and have no software or battery expertise and therefore perpetually low margins. 

Tesla on the other hand, is very high growth. Every single additional EV they sell adds to their business and does not take away from any other part of their business. Tesla has very little debt and has shown incredible operating leverage with their costs. Tesla also has a core competency in software and is already selling billions of dollars of software in their cars every year. I haven’t even mentioned their innovations in battery technology. 

I have a $1,500 price target for Tesla in 2025 based on taking about 25% of the BEV market (16 million vehicles globally versus 2 million today), plus selling energy products, autonomy, vehicle software/connectivity, insurance, and service.

85,CAR," I'm inclined to agree.  Jobs was a douche too but he also had that way of demanding the product be something truly at the top of the design and quality curve. Every mac I've ever owned except one, I sold in perfect working condition after about 3-5 years. They're far from perfect but they require about 1/5 the tech maintenance of a PC. Apple iWhatever devices tend to last forever, if the software wasn't rigged for a mandatory upgrade every 2 years.

Musk on the other hand seems far more interested in being an abrasive and inflammatory eclectic ""visionary"" than creating a rock solid product that will outlast the competition. UX wise...I don't know.  Everyone loves their Tesla, so I'm sure the UX is fantastic. That alone has a huge value.

We own a Nissan Leaf that's admittedly a lot less sexy than a Tesla, but bought used for literally 1/3 the new price, only three years old and 30K miles. So far after 40k additional miles, the actual necessary maintenance and repairs have been close to zero. We can sell it today for a total average annual cost of ownership of maybe $3500. That includes electricity, repairs, tax, insurance, interest on the loan, depreciation, everything. Since it was used, we didn't even get the tax breaks. Show me any other vehicle that nails those numbers at 10K miles a year.

You can nitpick it, but as much as I desire a Tesla for the ""cool"" factor, we are looking into another Leaf. The value to cost ratio is 100% positive. If VW and a few other manufacturers get their products in line and have a high reliability and low TCO, most people will NOT buy Teslas. They will buy whatever mid-market electric vehicle they feel is offering them a good value proposition in a fresh looking package. All it will take is a little bit of competition on the sexy/performance side and Tesla will be taking some hard hits on the sales side.

87,NVDA," Nothing I have said is conecture, it's verifiable fact, but I can tell you're not interested in discussing this in a goodwilled way so I'll say the following and leave you to your hate-on.

Tesla has been an early adopter of cutting edge TSMC nodes and has claimed PPW numbers for their ADAS hardware far superior to anything NVDA had at the time. They're currently working on a follow-up as well and I would expect them to continue to be an early adopter for new nodes.

No other company has 2170 cells and no other will have 4680s or dry electrode or tabless battery tech in the near-term. No other company has the single-piece castings that Tesla does or have even begun to pursue some of the types of changes they're pursuing with structural batteries or their Cybertruck. These are major cost advantages if they continue to execute on them. 

They're leading on software, particularly with OTA updates and have real-world charging times that beat almost if not all of their competition as well as a charging network that is 2nd to none. They also have a growing energy business which is poised to replace gas peaker plant capacity in the mid-term and gas baseload in the long-term.

None of this necessary means Tesla is a good investment at current prices, but it does mean those who try to argue that they're just another generic auto manufacturer are mistaken at best. Also notable is that none of these advantages require them to lead in ADAS.",Runningflame570,0,/r/investing/comments/mcxfrj/the_end_of_teslas_dominance_may_be_closer_than_it/gs7iwth/,0.073,0.809,0.118,0.9404

I still think the stock is overvalued by around 4x.  This next year will be interesting.  I'd like to see their margins on the Model 3 for the next year and a year where carbon credits aren't a big portion of their income.  I think I would buy around 150, but only if they have excellent margins on the Model 3.  i don't see them producing more cars than Ford and GM combined within the next 10 years, so in order to justify that price they would need to show excellent margins.

I am aware though that especially ETFs on this particular index are pushed by financial advisors and on Reddit like crazy, because it ""only"" has 65.5% US exposure and because of that, is perceived ""safer"" than a pure S&P500 fund for some reason.

Another point to keep in mind: World markets are strongly correlated to the US market, if the S&P crashes, so will other indices, again we're back at the risk point.

Generally, owning a buttload of stocks (including great ones, good ones, mediocre ones and absolute garbage ones) is not necessarily safer than just owning a handful of great companies you have done your research on.

I have done pretty well just owning boring but safe stocks for the past decade, definitely better than an S&P or World index ETF considering price appreciation and compound interest of the positions.

If you feel like you can invest the time to do research and pick companies, then select a handful of great ones and they will probably do better than most index ETFs, if you can't then just buy the S&P500 and be done with it, it's very unlikely that the US is going to fail during your lifetime and owning another 1000 stocks is not really going to reduce the already minimal risk.",rhoadsalive,-2,/r/investing/comments/mcrdwo/sp_500_vs_msci_world_index/gs6dbiz/,0.067,0.769,0.165,0.986

185,ALL," Need help with deciding where to put uninvested cash...

Here's my situation (sorry for length):

&#x200B;

I'm 28. I've been fortunate enough to accumulate roughly $15k in savings with an additional $14k invested in the market (29k total). 

Due to the nature of my career (where I've just made a big break through so I can't let up) I might not receive any more income until August and that's not even guaranteed... on top of that my career requires me to put a hefty amount of time in even when I'm not being paid so I can't accept full-time work. So essentially I'm living off my savings until then. Without divulging too much info/doxxing myself... I'm guaranteed another 12k by EOY but it's not in my pocket yet but I know for sure I'm getting it.

Now to the big question. How much of this cash I'm sitting on should I invest vs keep on hand? Is there a safe place to stash it so it can grow but also be accessed without penalty? 

I did the math and after 6 months minus ALL of my expenses (rent/etc), and getting half of the 12k I mentioned then I will have roughly $11k in uninvested cash. 

&#x200B;

TL;DR: I have 15k of cash sitting in my bank uninvested, but it's also functioning as my income until August, or later worst-case scenario. What should I be doing with my uninvested cash? Put more in the market? I don't want to lock it into an IRA in case an emergency happens.

I have no expenses currently (really cool parents), so I feel obligated to make the most of it while I can and hopefully I can return the favor to them later on.

I'm willing to risk a bit, but obviously minimal risk possible is preferable.

My thinking was (and keep in mind, I'm very new to the stock market in general so my knowledge is limited);

Long term: SPX, MSFT, TSLA, maybe a few other blue chip or near blue chip tech investments.

Short term: I was thinking General Electric, Etsy, and maybe some travel/airline/bus/vacation companies, due to the likelihood of those sectors boosting up post-covid. Maybe also some cryptocurrency, although I don't know if that's still a good play.

I'm less worried about hitting my goal (I can figure it out as I go) and more so asking, does this look like a good starter portfolio? Anything I should remove or add? And am I likely to get anything meaningful back from it?

188,ANY," I'm not an expert but I know the gist and just in case no one responds...

Super simplified-- a wash sale essentially postpones your ability to claim any losses on your underlying investement. So if you buy a stock, sell, then buy within a short period of time you won't be able to claim ANY losses on said stock until you sell your underlying. 

Example -- I buy $AAPL for $120 a share and it plummets to $50 and I sell, but then see a reversal happening and buyback then that $70 loss I realized cannot be claimed on taxes until I inevitably sell the underlying stock I now hold again. 

&#x200B;

Some one please correct me if I'm wrong. Taxes are not my strong suit.",S3CR3TN1NJA,1,/r/investing/comments/mctu5w/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gs7gk1b/,0.164,0.736,0.099,-0.8463
189,NAV," It's a closed end fund. That means it has a portfolio and calculates its net asset value periodically, but because new shares aren't created or liquidated to meet demand, the shares can trade at a premium or discount to NAV on the market.  

Like any investment fund or stock, your return is not just the dividend. The NAV of the fund can also rise (and fall), and the market price should roughly follow NAV.  

Permanent investment vehicle means that the shares exist and investors can't withdraw money from the fund like they can from a normal hedge fund or mutual fund or ETF, only sell them on the market. Ackman will be able to continue managing the fund and collecting a management fee as long as he wants and as long as there is money in the fund.",kiwimancy,1,/r/investing/comments/mctu5w/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gs6o9lv/,0.026,0.848,0.126,0.9259

199,COWN," Yep, RILY is not much higher either. 

One thing. I would not necessarily consider these investment banks to be defensive/safe haven. In reality investment banks also benefit significantly when the market has been as strong as it has been. There’s more IPOs, more deals, more capital raising, consulting etc. If there are significant downturns, then these will also be impacted. 

On the other, in any case I still think they provide a much better value proposition than some growth stocks. RILY has no analyst coverage, COWN was just called undervalued by Piper Sandler two days ago with a PT of 68 and overweight rating. There’s also solid dividends, especially for RILY.
