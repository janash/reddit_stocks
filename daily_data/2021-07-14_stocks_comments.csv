3,PDT," I'm shocked no one has given the correct answer yet.  The correct answer is DCA.

DCA is where you put a consistent amount from every paycheck into the stock market.  This means you buy low when a dip happens and you buy low when a crash happens.  It means you'll get a good deal without having to time the market.

DCA means buy.  When the market goes down it's a buying opportunity.  When the market goes up, you don't know if it's at the top or still going up, so it's a buying opportunity.

If you sell there are short term capital gains tax consequences.  DCA does not mean sell.  You should never sell if you can help it.  The more you make the larger the hit, so instead the ideal approach if you want to time the market is hedging strategies.  Most of them unlock in the US when your account size is 100k+, kind of like PDT for 25k.  Hedging is superior to selling.",proverbialbunny,59,/r/stocks/comments/ojr5lv/goldman_sachs_has_liquidated_5_billion_of_stock/h5479ap/,0.062,0.795,0.143,0.9283

Then and only then develop a \~10 stock speculative portfolio that you did a lot of DD. For me, more than 10 are difficult to keep current.

It also taught me to have a strategy on both the upside run and to manage downside risk (if any drops by \~15% I am out but will watch).

Rookie mistake and I got way too excited about a stock.",HammerheadRhino,5,/r/stocks/comments/ojvw9m/what_was_the_biggest_mistake_you_have_made_or/h54f8y9/,0.078,0.811,0.112,0.3627
48,TA," I'm a new investor+trader (came in during the gme period, but moreso because I finally had enough cash to invest than to join in on all the pump and dumps), and my current biggest mistake was twofold:

I got cocky, and I went against my own advice/planning. I had been profiting massively off of some basic puts because by some miracle I saw the march-april downturn coming. However, I wanted to test myself with calls so I decided to make a big play on Disney's Q1 earnings betting on the reopening and Disney+ numbers to pay off big. I ended up losing nearly all of my options money and it caused me to scramble a bit and I made some subsequent mistakes because of it, losing me about a quarter of my portfolio over the course of that month total. 

I learned a lot of lessons for it though, and I'm not too worried because I am still playing with sub-10k in funds so I'm glad to learn my mistakes now rather than later. Here's some of the trading lessons I learned for others new here (though no one's path/risk tolerance is the same so don't take my word as the only truth):

* When you're confident in something, double down on your due diligence in it beforehand. It is when you're most confident that you're most vulnerable to making a mistake.

* Playing single-leg options on earnings are very risky plays, and if you bet on a stock moving against the market with it doubly so.

* A 4% move on a megacap name like Disney hits a lot harder than a 4% move on even other large caps. This can greatly affect your options for better or worse.

* Do not put too many eggs in one basket. If you're putting too much on a single options bet it can make or break you. Usually break you.

* When a stock moves in a direction against your options, do not double down on your play and buy more just to try and ""earn it back"" or ""lower your cost average"". There's more reasonable logic to doing it (miscalculating your TA price points, sudden news event shifting things in your favor, etc) but generally it's better to stick to how much you invested, your buy price, your stop-sell price, and your limit sell price. Sticking to that is how you minimize losses and keep consistent gains.

I have learned a lot more beyond that but I'm really not the best authority on this stuff. I just wanted to share with the class :).",Mad_Hatter96,4,/r/stocks/comments/ojvw9m/what_was_the_biggest_mistake_you_have_made_or/h54glv5/,0.1,0.766,0.133,0.9559

201,TDA," For SPHQ, what platforms can even trade this particular ETF after hours?  That would be the first thing I'd look into.  Does not appear it can be moved pre or post market on TDA.

Most platforms that ""work"" in after hours for retail investors are limited to a certain batch of stocks that have a volume threshold to make it worth their time for processing or else they'd be doing business at a loss and need to charge fees to make up the difference.  (And at that point, might as well look at the OTC market.)

If you're actually just looking for the after hours valuations of the ETF holdings, that is a little different.  You can probably setup a watch list or similar to keep track of that, but getting the ratio percentages 100% accurate would probably need a paid service or spreadsheet linked to streaming data.

211,NVDA," Stock split means basically nothing. The value of the shares are exactly the same. It's such minor news it's not even worth mentioning.

If you believe in NVDA and think they are reasonably priced, there's no reason to sell. Especially because of a stock split. I'm up about +350% on NVDA because I just don't pay attention to the minor news. It doesn't matter when you're a company like NVDA with their market position.

Remember too. If you've held less than a year, you're paying short term capital gains. After taxes, the value you hold in NVDA is not directly transferable to your net worth if you sell. For this reason, you should really be hesitant to sell great companies, even if their evaluation seems a little rich. If you plan to hold companies 10+ years (which I recommend that you do), the company will be overvalued for months, even years, but if the underlying asset is still solid, theres no reason to sell. 

Imagine if you bought aapl in 2005 and sold everytime you thought it was a little pricy or they had a stock split. Pain attention to the company, the market is secondary",msnebjsnsbek5786,7,/r/stocks/comments/ojw67f/nvidia_stock_split_on_july_20th/h54aj4i/,0.084,0.829,0.087,0.1464
212,VERY," Just my opinion, but I think that its possible that there may be a sell off before the split. If everyone is thinking there will be a bump due to new investors with the lower price, then I'm sure hedge funds and large holders have already thought of that as well. Anticipation of a surge in value is exactly a perfect opportunity for someone to dump the stock at an all time high with plenty of buyers. I'm sure that in the future, the price may make perfect sense as the company is breaking new ground and profitable. But right now in relation to its price.... VERY speculative. Pricing in many years of growth.

Not saying it will happen, but there is just so much optimism about the split, that I bet a downturn is not even in the realm of possibility for some.",ParagonT,4,/r/stocks/comments/ojw67f/nvidia_stock_split_on_july_20th/h54co2m/,0.036,0.716,0.248,0.9894
213,AAPL," If you 100% believe it will have a small bump followed by a sell-off, then you should sell....and buy it back at the lower price. This insures you collect the moderate profits you currently have.

If you are unsure, then sell some (maybe half of your stake). This way if it goes down, then you can buy more and get a better DCA. If it goes up, then you made some profits on what you sold and you still have some to ride the upswing.

If you believe this is a good long term stock, then sell nothing. Hold on to your shares. If it dips due to a sell-off, then add more to your current position and wait until whatever your long term period is. If the company is good enough, then it will catch up to its ""overhauled"" value.

What ever you decide, be sure to learn from your choice.

My DCA for the stock is $151. I've had it for over 3 years. I consider it one of my core holdings and I plan to hold on to it for another 15 - 20 years, unless the fundamentals change.

A stock split adds no value. The false psychology of equating a lower cost price with a discount is what drives the frenzy (if there is one). In simple terms....if you split/change a dollar into 4 quarters, then you still have a dollar's worth of value. There is no difference between the value of 4 quarters and the value of a dollar bill.

Recall when TSLA split...the stock shot up 40+% over several months following the news and split.

When AAPL split, it shot up for a couple of days and then went down. If I would have waited 7-12 days after the split, then I could have bought it at a better price. Instead, it would be several months before I saw any green.

214,TSLA," If you 100% believe it will have a small bump followed by a sell-off, then you should sell....and buy it back at the lower price. This insures you collect the moderate profits you currently have.

If you are unsure, then sell some (maybe half of your stake). This way if it goes down, then you can buy more and get a better DCA. If it goes up, then you made some profits on what you sold and you still have some to ride the upswing.

If you believe this is a good long term stock, then sell nothing. Hold on to your shares. If it dips due to a sell-off, then add more to your current position and wait until whatever your long term period is. If the company is good enough, then it will catch up to its ""overhauled"" value.

What ever you decide, be sure to learn from your choice.

My DCA for the stock is $151. I've had it for over 3 years. I consider it one of my core holdings and I plan to hold on to it for another 15 - 20 years, unless the fundamentals change.

A stock split adds no value. The false psychology of equating a lower cost price with a discount is what drives the frenzy (if there is one). In simple terms....if you split/change a dollar into 4 quarters, then you still have a dollar's worth of value. There is no difference between the value of 4 quarters and the value of a dollar bill.

Recall when TSLA split...the stock shot up 40+% over several months following the news and split.

When AAPL split, it shot up for a couple of days and then went down. If I would have waited 7-12 days after the split, then I could have bought it at a better price. Instead, it would be several months before I saw any green.

218,IMO," In short high inflation means higher interest rates to take money out of the economy to suppress inflation.  Higher interest rates means higher yields on bond prices, which means money starts flowing out of stocks into bonds or other financial instruments, which means stock price growth stalls or falls...However blue chip stocks are still one of the better instruments to guard against inflation as fixed income and bonds typically do worse that stocks.


You are missing a piece of the puzzle called Velocity of money. 

One persons' income is another persons spending. If the government gives you $1000 but you keep it, the economy doesn't grow. If you spend that 1K, and that person spends their 1K, it's cyclical.  It creates a lot of buying and selling, supply and demand. Companies start making more product, hiring more workers, the money supply grows as companies borrow money to build more production to meet demand...so more money in the market by increased borrowing and credit equals inflation rising.

When the pandemic happened people stopped buying, which means peoples income and spending dropped. Less need to borrow, less credit in the economy means inflation was low.  Big banks have limits on how much they can borrow, the interest rate is already so low that it's not like they could borrow more money...Well they were given special permissions to borrow more strictly because of covid. That period has since ended.

Anyways, The inflation rate was low because velocity of money stopped even though lots of money was being printed because people were scared about their future and they were saving money.

The reason why good prices increased soon after was because of the stimulus money being sent out which equaled more disposable money to spend directly on goods. Disruptions to the supply chains with lockdowns meant supply was suppressed. Low supply, bigger demand equals price increases. You should note that this caused inflation in goods prices, but not services.

The initial concern was all the extra money out their once the economy started to recover would potentially cause inflation to spike massively.....Now that the ""covid crash"" is recovering we are seeing a little bit of that... But wait, theirs more..........

Assets = Liabilities + equity &nbsp;

Equity = Assets - Liabilities &nbsp;

Liabilities = Assets - equity

The equations must always balance. This helps understand things.

Big banks and financial players saw a buying opportunity during the covid crash. Buy low and sell high right?   Banks and financial institutions were granted special powers to spend and borrow more to help stimulate the economy. 

So they borrowed and spent a lot on stock/equity markets, which rose significantly after the crash. If you thought the market was going to rip you'd make a killing and that is what they did...Made a killing. 

How else could you make more money? By shorting.. When you short you pocket the money. Cash is an asset, likewise a short position a liability.   What if you knew that a financial instrument wasn't going to increase in value, so you could short it and put the cash into the market that was on a rocketship? You would do exactly that. The instrument that was shorted was treasury bonds as the fed said they won't be increasing interest rates for a while. 

So big money shorted the hell out of the treasury bonds which helped keep bond rates low.  So right now the market is literally propped up on margin with borrowed money from shorted liabilities of Treasury bonds and cheap borrowed money.

Their is a few problems here.

If the fed said, hey we are rising Interest Rates, it would cause  treasury bond yields to shoot up quickly.   Remember a short position is a liability. If your liabilities rose quickly you would be in trouble and I feel like risk management departments don't take that scenario seriously.

The demand for shorting treasuries was soo high, that someone who borrowed a treasury, would make more money by lending it out to someone else to borrow  and short.  This is called rehypothecation.    If the first person that shorted the treasuries needed it back, it could force a few other people to cover and this would be happening all over the place causing mass volatility with bankruptcies, margin calls, squeezes...Eeek  

This is why people are expecting a market crash and it's not coming yet. The fed understands they could set off a bomb by too much talk about interest rates rising. They need to do it slowly over time so financial entities have time to unwind their balance sheets. This is why they hint of it rising in the future.

This is my opinion only, but the only thing making money right now is  big cap blue tech stocks, which is the financial instrument of choice as a defensive strategy in a market depression/stagflation.   Small and mid cap stocks have seen stagflation since march. Google mid cap index, or small cap index to check the charts for yourselves. 

IMO leverage is unwinding and Big money is preparing for an economic slowdown. Weather that is a crash, depression, stagflation, is not certain. I feel like as soon as big tech stops advancing so rapidly the slowdown will start and we will see it probably coincide with interest rates rising.",Uruk123,4,/r/stocks/comments/ok64t7/could_someone_explain_why_high_inflation_rates/h56uhkv/,0.127,0.774,0.099,-0.9825

279,EA," >If you can get a copy of fifa 2020, or borderlands, into the hands of a customer then it is likely a new revenue source for the publisher. At the same time, the unique player card from fifa or borderlands gun has value to gamers also. Facilitating this market is a vast ocean of possibility.

Sure, but how does any of this money make significant money for the retailer? Unless they are creating the content, they are still selling other peoples stuff and only profiting on margins. Those margins will be absurdly thin considering that the consumer can buy the same product directly from the manufacturer. PS Store, Microsoft store, Google Play and Apple App store do all of this successfully already and they can allow for those razor thin margins since they use those 'stores' as a facilitator rather than a profit making endeavor. Gamestop doesn't have that luxury. 

&#x200B;

>Publishers can still go direct, and they will. That’s a different part of consumer demand. Used games never fullfilled all segments of demand, but does fill a substantial portion of demand.  
  


Publishers have always hated the concept of used games and in the heyday of Gamestop and physical games, they really had no choice but to accept it. It's one of many reasons why they went so hard for digital in the first place. Now they have power over it. So why would they voluntarily revert back to the used game model when they can't consistently profit off of it? EA and PS recently launched a subscription model that has a nice backlog of games to play for $5 a month. I can play FIFA 2021 through EA Play right now and if I'm EA, I'm going all in on the subscription model and doing whatever I can to make sure it's the best avenue to play those games for the consumer. 

And even if it does work out (and I believe parts of it will), all of this makes Gamestop an intriguing company that certainly has it's place in the video game market. But in order to justify it's current valuation, let alone valued at 10x this (which would put it way ahead of publishers like Take Two, Activision and EA) they can't just play alongside the stiff competition, they need to squash them. That means wiping out the budding subscription model and taking massive sales away from developers. I can't see that happening.",kamrali,1,/r/stocks/comments/ojx1nl/whats_your_next_100bagger_company/h568evg/,0.046,0.788,0.167,0.9951

281,ALL," Gamestop's used game market was failing and stores were closing long before the pandemic. Yes, the margins were good but that's because you can only buy and sell from Gamestop rather than between consumers. 

Publishers still hate used games. What makes more sense for them - A. to discount an old digital game significantly (which happens all the time), B. offer it in a sub model (driving sub growth) or C. having a third party capture that revenue and hope that the buyer buys in game content?

The answer is B and if you want to know where the video game market is headed, look at streaming movie/tv services. Discounted games and free games (that generate revenue after the sale), directly from the publisher for $5 a month. This is a system that is already in place and allows the creators to capture ALL of the revenue.

What you're describing is essentially using NFTs for games and content. For games, sure, it allows you to buy and sell it later but that's only worthwhile for a buyer if you're getting the game at a significant discount and in an era where older digital games are discounted regularly and heavily, what's the real gain here?

For DLC, an NFT is certainly a great concept. But again, if I'm a developer, I'm selling that NFT direct to consumer. Now they can go to Gamestop and flip it but how much money is Gamestop really making by only taking fees from that transaction? It's basically a digital ebay with a smaller overall market. 

Has any executive from Gamestop specifically said that this is the avenue they are pursuing? It's ambitious and it really only makes sense if they are the ones creating the content.",kamrali,1,/r/stocks/comments/ojx1nl/whats_your_next_100bagger_company/h56ndvf/,0.023,0.822,0.155,0.9906

People may argue this is incorrect but that’s another discussion, as it’s more about nominal vs real NPV calcs if I’m not mistaken.
