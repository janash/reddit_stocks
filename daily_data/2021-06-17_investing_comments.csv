5,IMO," at your age you should skew towards the more growth oriented names/funds. Personally I think having a mix of dividend and value in there as well is always a good idea but a smaller % that you can increase as you get older.

Having that boring but steady dividend payer is very satisfying as you watch it grow with DRIP over the years. 

I also STRONGLY recommend selling OTM covered calls on your long term positions. You assume no additional downside risk and it is a steady source of income to either re-invest or help pay the bills. If you're not familiar with options you should definitely get an understanding first but once you're comfortable covered calls are a no-brainer IMO",culculain,1,/r/investing/comments/o1zxq4/should_i_focus_more_on_growth_or_dividend_stocks/h2403vd/,0.088,0.68,0.232,0.9665
6,GOOG," Index fund is a good idea. Tons of professional advisors suggest an index fund ETF from the GOAT Warren Buffett to ex-Goldman TV personalities like Jim Cramer would. I would reiterate on that.

Cramer would suggest doing a 90/10 or a 0-20% split between index and what he calls ""mad money"". This is your speculative money. OFC each person's risk tolerance and ability to pick stocks is different so I highly recommend starting with an ETF with a small portion of riskier money as it offers:

1. An early start at building a steady base. Earlier the better as it allow for more time to compound.

2. An opportunity to try out your strats/picks at very little cost. IMO if you're young with stable income and living arrangements then you can take more risk, but that's really varies by person.

3. An early investor can easily compare their trade/strat performance to the index. Say you buy VOO and also bought GOOG on the same day. You can check if your GOOG pick is outperforming, equal, underperforming the VOO. This also allows for easily compare performance further down the line if needed and/or retroactively into the past in the future.",zxc123zxc123,1,/r/investing/comments/o1zxq4/should_i_focus_more_on_growth_or_dividend_stocks/h246nva/,0.033,0.854,0.113,0.9078

18,AI," While dividend stocks are alluring they are more like short term instant gratification versus growth stocks can take a while to appreciate but in the long term the return on investment will heavily outweigh dividend stocks IF you choose the right growth stocks…

Your goal should be to find the companies that not 10x but hundreds or thousands x

Some factors I look for in growth stocks:
- Strong leader (bonus points if its the founder)
- Strong fundamentals such as:
   -Market leader in industry or high potential to be
   -Large pipeline of quality products, services and revenue streams on their roadmap
   -Cult like following (like apple/tesla but apple isn’t innovating as much anymore) bc this indicates  how good the product/service is & high demand
   -Innovative
   -High R&D and continual product improvements
   -Industry disrupting
   -Delivered or will soon* deliver products/services
- Profitable or soon to be
- Decent cash on hand

Tesla is my largest holding below is why. Other examples coinbase, square, airbnb, etc

Tesla is not merely a car company, its more so an AI and energy company. Investing in Tesla is investing in artificial intelligence tech that will power autonomous cars, drastically changing personal travel (cars will then also be a platform for entertainment like your iphone- 30% of Apple’s revenue is generated from the app store) as we know it today but also be licensed across other industries. It is investing in batteries that will power cars, but also store energy for all. The issue with power consumption and peak energy usage amongst large scale utility companies is there’s no way to store enough energy no matter how its generated. Tesla has engineered batteries down to the chemistry to manufacture industry leading battery tech. They are already and will deliver more utility scale power grids projects. Check out the ones like South Australia’s Hornsdale Power Reserve powering 50,000 homes, in Hawaii, in NorCal, in Texas and more. So yeah Tesla’s coming for the utility companies too.

Also forgot to mention when Tesla perfects their full-self driving tech (its excellent already btw) then they’ll deploy robo taxis taking market share away from uber and lift.  So many bright revenue channels ahead for Tesla I can’t even name them all.

Good luck!",siestafiestawarrior,1,/r/investing/comments/o1zxq4/should_i_focus_more_on_growth_or_dividend_stocks/h24eovo/,0.017,0.755,0.228,0.9983

49,ALL," Dividend players are generally more established companies, while growth players are generally trading at prices over their fundamental value because the promise for growth in the future is stronger.

Take the dividend aristocrats for example.  Companies like Proctor and Gamble, Abbot Laboratories, ATT, 3M, Coca-Cola, etc. etc.  In the period from February 20 to their price bottom, none of these companies fell by more than 50%, and most of them were more in the 20%-30% drop range.

Now take some growth companies for example.  Tesla, Roku, clean energy stocks like SunRun, emerging technology companies like Microvision or UAVS.  These are just some of the growth stocks I follow, so by survivorship bias they have all done extremely well since bottoming out.  But they ALL dropped  by more than 50%, with most of them more in the 60%-80% range.

This is the nature of a market crash against companies pulling earnings forward versus established players with a long and consistent history of increasing their dividends.  Due to the historic market rebound, growth was the better play if you could stomach the volatility and hold, but in a situation like the dot com crash or the great recession where prices get depressed for years at a time, someone who needs that money to survive has to sell at a massive discount and cannot rely on dividends, as most companies pulling earnings forward as far as growth companies are not paying a useful dividend.

Bonds are safer of course, but the returns are pitiful.  It just depends on your objectives.  Growth is absolutely without a doubt riskier than dividend plays and of course bonds, but your chance to outperform is larger.

If you want to do something USD based and not want the risk of equities you could buy a USD stable coin and leave it on an exchange that pays interest.

Consider Yotta. It's a savings account with a flat .2% APY, that for every $25 in your account you get a ""powerball-esq"" ticket into a weekly lottery drawing. Win or lose your account balance never decreases. Each week you just have that many tickets again. The math works out to something like 3-5% real APY for most users.

Yeah, it sounds like a scam, that's only because this is not a common thing in America.... but it is in many other parts of the world. 

But how TF can they pay that out? 

They contract with banks that provide higher interest rates than you or I can get. That interest pays for 3 things.

Your flat 0.2% APY

Pay insurance premium for payouts of prizes.

Yotta contracts with insurance companies that actually do pay out of prizes. These insurance companies do similar with state lottos and other private ones. They absorb variance by averaging across multiple inputs.

I you do decide to check it out, I humbly ask you to use my referral code, which I will PM if requested. (We both get one-time free tickets)

Totally depends on your country, and where your shares are based too. To give a random example. In the UK you get both a capital gains allowance tax free and a dividend allowance tax free.

117,GM," > Hey guy’s, I want to know why people are investing in car companies(Ford,Hyundai,GM etc) and fuel/oil companies if their stock is clearly going down over time.

The auto industry has traditionally been a capital intensive and highly competitive industry - the list of bankruptcies is a mile long (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_defunct_automobile_manufacturers_of_the_United_States; Aston Martin has gone bankrupt 7 times and almost had #8 last year.) People hype EVs because they believe in green (although they often seem primarily interested in green when it's companies that make sleek things they'd like to own) but it doesn't change the fact that the auto industry is a difficult industry. How many times has Musk asked like Tesla was on the brink? A lot of the low quality EV names that have gone public via SPAC in the last year probably won't be around in 5 years yet people were buying everything remotely EV related last year and early this year as if they were all going to be wildly successful.

""A “big market delusion,” according to the paper, occurs when all the firms in an evolving industry rise together, despite that fact that they are competing against each other and only some can ultimately succeed. The trio cited airlines as a past example of an industry built around emerging technology, where “virtually every company in the business either failed or merged into a larger airline, most of which also collapsed.” (https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1qx4f8709q5nf/Big-Market-Delusion-Rob-Arnott-Attacks-Tesla-Electric-Vehicle-Industry)",dvdmovie1,5,/r/investing/comments/o1soxb/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/h22v1zd/,0.051,0.864,0.085,0.7349

I've never cared about cars that much and think it's overhyped. But, to some it's the future. Look at Ford now. It's being PUMPED by CNBC and Cramer. GM, too.   


If it's one thing I've learned about the car industry, it's not something I would invest in because I could care less. I'm a tech guy and I see the whole IVY, infotainment, app store, autonomous driving BS that's being thrown around and it's an absolute joke.

Like really? It's THAT big of a new market? Okay, if the infotainment system doesn't have spotify, netflix, amazon, google, apple products like it would, then what's stopping those companies from integrating?  


If anything, I think there's going to be a market now for companies that can monetize paying at the pump or like driving up and buying in your car before you pick up. But, it's NOTHING different than having an iPhone or Android Phone on you.

And still an increasing number. The company currently has more money than it is worth on the stock market. So basically a bargain. Why the hell would you sell it???

&#x200B;

1. Unity makes power! Take a look at the monkeys of AMC. We founded Neovacs because it is a good company with a huge potential for medicines. The only way to succeed is to stay with 1 share. Since so many people already believe in Neovacs, this is the only way to stop the group action at neovacs! As you can see, the price of Neovacs has been stable for several days. Today even in the upward trend! So reorganize and buy Neovacs to the moon !!!

Currently have a Vanguard account with about 5k in VTSAX. Auto contributing about 500 a month. 

I have my emergency fund all set, and a recurring CD of about 4k.

I know the mutual fund itself is diversified, but should I do additional diversification by getting 1-2 more MFs in my portfolio? I'm not very knowledgeable about investing in general so my risk aversion is relatively high.

Also, I work in a job that gets me bonus checks every few months. My initial thought it to take about 3/4 of these checks and invest them as well. I'm assuming I would just drop that money into the MFs that I already have as I dont have the knowledge base to go buying single stocks on my own.

My biggest concern is that I'm nearing the second half of my working career and I need to play some serious catch up since I basically dont have anything to show for my 20s-30s work.

After following Tim Hale I have 65% FTSE global all cap, 25% global bond hedge (both vanguard), and 10% in bitcoin and ethereum.  I have around 4k to invest inivitially.  Then I will put £350 a month in. Does this sound like a relatively safe long term portfolio?

How old are you? What country do you live in?
38 UK

Are you employed/making income? How much?
£42k per year but should jump by 5k in next year or two.

What are your objectives with this money? (Buy a house? Retirement savings?)
Not entirely sure - seems wise to invest

What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs?
It would be nice to start using some returns in 5-10 years - do people do this, or just keep it all invested?

What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know its 100% safe?)
Medium.  Hence 25% in bonds.

What are you current holdings? (Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors? Any other assets?)
No

Any big debts (include interest rate) or expenses?

183,MSCI," Question around index funds. I'm invested in 3 and the plan is to allocate 80% of my stock portfolio there. I have a long-term horizon (at least 15 yrs). 

The allocation is: 

* (EXXT) Nasdaq 100 index - 30% 
* (SXR8) S&P 500 index - 20%
* (CN1G) MSCI Nordic UCITS ETF-C - 30%

Since I do believe tech will keep on riding for the foreseeable future, I wanna keep some % of my portfolio there. But my big concern is around both S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 represented in my portfolio (as Nasdaq's holdings is pretty much a subset of S&P 500). I just am not able to decide what's the good approach. So if someone critical is able to challenge me, that'd be great!

1. Does it make sense to keep 50% of my portfolio in the US market? I don't mind heavy corrections and have taken these as buying opportunities & continue to do so, but is it still a wise thing to do?
2. Am I (wrongly) too light on emerging markets & smaller caps?
3. Should I just put the S&P money to a total market index ETF and lose out on a bit of money (I'm yet to find a total market index which has better long-term returns than S&P 500, although past results don't translate into the future etc)?

She said there are other factors affecting the NAV, such as call options (which I admit to not understanding yet).

191,IMO," If I was in your shoes I would do this,

1. Pay back her student loan with the money as much as you can leaving enough savings to put in the bank for a rainy day and a little seed money, start with small amount, for you or her to begin learning how to invest money. (I would say 1000 USD would be a good start.)
2. Than the next smartest thing you can do is see if she have a interest to learn about money, finance and investing. Or in other words is she willing to to invest the time to get a real financial education.
3. If she or you is willing, than start talking and interviewing several financial advisors, and start developing a financial plan is a good step 1. Some good question to ask is to let them show you their portfolio, and have them explain to you why they invest in the things they do. (Most importantly you want to verify that the people do what they preach and not just collecting a fee from you) And use that 1000 dollars seed money you set aside and start investing in 100 increment so you can start learning and getting use to the proceedure and nuance of buying different financial vehicles, like stocks, bonds, mutual funds, options, real estates, commodities etc etc.... Remember in the beginning it doesn't matter if you learn or lose, your goal is to increase your knowledge.
4. Keep in mind that all investment have risk, even what deemed to be low risk investment doesn't guarantee a return and can possibly lose you money. The only way to lower your risk in investment is getting a financial education, not having one and only relying on other people's tips and opinion is the most risky, IMO, thing you can do. Also what you invest and how you get there through investing vastly differs in what is your goal with the money you tend to invest and how fast you want to get there with it and of course the risk you are willing to take on.

This is just my opinion on what I would have done. Of course please don't take it as financial or legal advice.

In summary, Pay down her bad debts IE (Student Loans) as fast as possible. And start investing in her or your financial education starting with very small amount of seed money that you don't mind losing even if the markets goes off a cliff (or money you can afford to lose). And lastly seek a competent financial advisor, so you know what is your financial goal and a solid plan on how that 40k can get you there. Hope this helps!

Lastly I want to end with this, investing is a team sport, not something you do alone, so when you are learning about investing, constantly talk to different people with different ideas than your own and constantly challenge your own ideas. You will ultimately end up with a team of your own ""experts"" with opinion ands judgement you trust with your money. That is being smart and not risky.",Mobile_Lumpy,1,/r/investing/comments/o1so89/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/h24qjm1/,0.063,0.847,0.091,0.9466
192,TV," I don't like bonds at all right now because the macro picture is one where interest rates almost have to rise.  when interest rates rise the bond itself you are holding becomes worth less to somebody else if you want to sell it... so you lose money.  Since bonds have been ""safe"" for something like 50 years even ""professionals"" are discounting the inherent risk in bonds.  Just because bonds have been reasonably safe doesn't mean they will stay that way (and of course there are several different types of bonds that have different risk reward profiles so there are ways for bond traders to make money regardless of the macro environment).  so yes I am saying there is a way to lose a chunk of money in supposedly ""safe"" bonds.

Gold & Silver have a lot of assumed value that I don't think is actually there.  If you look at them over a long scale, particularly since the US dumped backing the dollar with gold reserve, they act like cyclical commodities... and they aren't a good inflation hedge.  that doesn't mean you can't make money on gold in the short run, but it isn't a long term holding that will increase.  Whenever gold and silver are being pumped on TV and in ads, it may be an indicator that there's a scheme running.  just my opinion.",LiqCourage,1,/r/investing/comments/o1so89/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/h24qptt/,0.066,0.852,0.082,0.5498
193,MSCI," Yes, patience and information are key, and I would add, Discipline.  The market follows a cycle, and trades on real people's emotions about the money.  What you are feeling about losing money is a classically human bias to feel more pain from loss than from equivalent gain.  This bias is always present in how we handle the market, so you need a methodology to work around emotion so your decisions regards the market are clear.  It pays to have a macro view as it makes the normal market volatility easier to ride out.  I got my degree in engineering back in the day too so I think this concept will make sense to you like it does to me.  Perspective is also important.  The worst thirty year annualized return period in the MSCI ACWI, if you cherry pick it, from the '29 peak to '59 still returned 8% (not adjusted for inflation).  average returns over all thirty year periods are much better than that... 

there is nothing wrong with doing both investment for retirement and doing some short term trading as well.  it's nice to generate money you can use when you want.

SWAN looks to be long treasury and long SP500 LEAP calls. 

QYLD is a covered call strategy, so long equity, short vol. JEPI is similar, long equity with short option exposure. Both are nearly opposite exposure of SWAN.

NUSI has both long and short vol exposure with focus on income so I would guess it's net short vol. It's not clear to me at first glance what equity or yield exposure they have. 

DRSK looks to be an active equity/bond fund which is mostly allocated to corporate bonds with some varying exposure to equity options.
