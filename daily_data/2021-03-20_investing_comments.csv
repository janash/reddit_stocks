1,AI," Tech gave us bigger screens, lots of apps, inundating email, identity theft, fake news, robocalls, and the inability to reach a human to solve a problem in less than 2 hours.  Yes, we have info at our fingertips and trucks that drive themselves. Instant access to stock info.  But we spend hours of our day sifting through garbage to accomplish what used to take an hour.  Not to mention, the rampant scams of the day. Technology moves data faster than is humanly possible, but that's all it really does.  AI is algorithms, not creative thought.  While lives have improved, they have also been wasted by the enormous amount of minutiae. We also must spend thousands per year because technology changes. Running updates, backups.  And if tech goes down, we are powerless. At some point, a major crash will send humanity back to the dark ages.  Some of you have already experienced the financial problems of online only financial institutions. 🙄 Tech has its place.  But it's not the be all and end all.

2,AI," AI is improving fast, but we'd be lucky to get lvl 5 autonomic driving in 5 years. Real skynet? Ha. So far best we can do is complex math and statistics. Besides such a thing is impossible without a major redesign of computer chips at a fundamental (physical) level.

Brain-computer interfaces like Neuralink are the closest thing that can blur the lines between living and the machine, and will open a Pandora's box unlike anything else before. But they are still in their infancy and I see no major breakthroughs happening there in the next 5 years.

Quantum computer breakthrough will most likely happen in next 5 years but IMO that will follow similar timeline to what standard computers went through. At first they will be size of a building, then size of a bus, then size of a small room, and eventually small and powerful enough for commercial sale. But I suspect this cycle will take decades to complete and until then the best quantum computers will be a thing restricted for use of country-level entities.

Cathie Wood is right that the technologies listed are the future and I would love for a technological revolution to happen because we could use that to solve climate change for example.

You pointed out deflation in retail shopping. Costs of the same retail goods have remained the same or gone up. All Amazon and other platforms have done is provide cheaper and inferior alternatives.

I mean, China’s GDP is growing faster than the US, no doubt about it, but there are a bunch of metrics to use when determining if an economy is really taking over other than just GDP. The yuan would face a lot of scrutiny if it tried to become the world’s reserve currency, but it’s possible. I’m just not sure what any of this has to do with the idea that the US economy becomes another Great Depression.

Also, the word “precedes” doesn’t really make sense there. They didn’t precede the US in any of those areas, they’re just aggressively competing with mixed success.

16,DCF," ARK's estimation for robotaxi earnings by 2030 is much more than earnings of the most successful company's in the world earnings made over  it's lifetime - APPLE.

EVs take over numbers are also bananas. Currently there are 1.4 bn cars in the world. Each year 92m new units are sold world wide, let's say it's 100m. 

1. How long it'll take for new EVs to overtake combustion engine production per year?

2. How long it'll take for EVs to replace 70%  of the world's fleet? 

Answer to both is decades.

Its easy to make unrealistic expectations and percentage based predictions when you grow from 800k base. 10x is 1000% which sounds impressive, but when you know how percentages work it's not.

It's getting more and more like a scam when they constantly have to throw out surreal numbers on TAM & valuations, invent new paradigms and do mental gymnastics & esoteric arguments for buying stocks at 40x P/S with no earnings just to keep cash flowing in. Anyone can throw out numbers with no evidence.

The only reason they're not laughed out of the room is due to handful of stocks that propelled the fund to outperform.

21,BOOM," I can wrap my head around 5 mil by 2025. They are targeting 2 mill per year from giga Berlin, and I think I read somewhere giga Texas had a similar target. So throw fremont and Shanghai in at you can make an argument for 5 mil by 2025 with all currently planed factories at full capacity. 

The argument for 10 mil by 2025 is harder to justify. Or rather would need a lot more verified data points to make the arguments. 

First We would need to see how much their giga press can actually speed up production. Then see how many of them they can have going at one time and place. If it's as simple as set up 100 giga presses, cast all 3 segments of the car, then weld them together and throw in a few seats and a console and BOOM you're done. Then the yearly output of each factory can be increased dramatically. 

Second we would need announcements real soon on at least 2 new giga factories. I think giga Shanghai took like 18 months from break ground to production, but even now it's not at full production capacity. Meaning we would need these announcements by middle of this year to no later than Q3 2022. Plus we would need higher production goals for those plants. It's hard to image Tesla ramping 3 new giga factories before 2025 so 2 mill per year per factory is the minimum requirement for each new Factory to make 10 mill by 2025 make any sense.

Idk not physically impossible, and they have the cash to maybe pull something like this off, but fucking hell Ark is asking for an average 83%/year growth of production.

32,AI," 1. Detailed maps of the area that are annotated with lane markings, signs, etc. The advantage is that you don't have to _see_ everything in real-time. Eg. heavy traffic, snow, etc. blocking markings on the road. You can also deal with things prior to seeing them. Humans drive way more efficiently and safely on routes they're familiar with compared to fresh ones where they're constantly in the wrong lane and miss turnings. 

2. (and 3) I personally think yes and it's largely because of safety. With vision, you're relying on some higher level processing to interpret the image (eg. infer depth, detect objects, whatever). A LIDAR naturally provides 3D structure, so even if your perception models fail, worst case you still know there's something in your way. In the case of the Uber fatal incident, the victim was only present in the LIDAR data at the time the car could have safely stopped.  Also, cameras, especially those being used on cars, aren't nearly as good as human eyes. The human eye has all kinds of trickery to deal with difficult light conditions and ability to perceive depth that cameras can't compete with. Also there's not really many vision related tasks that AI actually performs better at than humans. Otherwise captchas wouldn't be a thing.

4. Waymo. What they do right is first and foremost design the car to be an autonomous car. That means it has the right sensor setup (LIDARs all over the place, very high quality 360 cameras, radars, etc), even though it makes the car look a bit silly. They also only operate within geofenced areas which means that they can limit the car from entering difficult scenarios. Does this limit the business over something that can drive anyway?

43,GDP," I think it's even less likely than that.  The fact of the matter is that the massive debt carried by both the Federal government and State/local governments is unsustainable with even moderate interest rates.  Anything above near-0 is a major problem.

You'd also have housing prices absolutely decimated.  Vehicles couldn't sell with substantial interest rates.  The price of anything commonly financed would either have to drop substantially or the product would get priced out as interest rates drive the overall cost up.  So broad segments of the economy would be crushed.

The Fed can't leave the 0-bound without major economic carnage.  It doesn't matter if there's inflation.  It doesn't matter if countries lose confidence in the dollar.  It doesn't matter what GDP does unless some miracle technology comes along to spur unrealistic real GDP growth (like over 10%) that can grow everyone out of debt.

Any move by the Fed for meaningful rate hikes would lead to them being responsible for the worst economic disaster since the Great Depression.  Have you ever seen a Fed chair willing to take that bullet?  Maybe Volcker?

44,AMD," I think companies like AMD and Nvidia have a massive tailwind. The growth of gaming revenue, cloud, work from home, etc. is going to be permanent. They are a bit backed up because of silicon shortages and the crypto boom, but TSMC and Samsung are increasing their output this year.

Imagine a situation where there's enough wafers to release all of the AMD new 2022 releases on TSMC 5nm. That's potentially another ~40% increase to revenues on top of the projected ~37% this year.

Who cares if the inflation is 2% or 3% when the company is growing 30-40% every year? It only captured 17% of the TAM so far, and the next node shrink should put it ahead one node of Intel.

I can't make a 2023 prediction yet, since that depends on how 7nm looks from Intel and new products. But I can't see any future where there isn't huge upside",iopq,3,/r/investing/comments/m937me/inflationistas_triggered_by_official_cpippi/grl0v3o/,0.024,0.88,0.096,0.8503

While Hollywood was basically shut down. Sure we will see a spike back up once cinemas open but i think a trend has been set. Alot of people of my generation have wondered do we still go to cinemas after this? That question alone shows a change in mindset has occured. Netflix was able to do this while posting records. Meanwhile AMC had to take on debt and dilute shares to survive all this. Alot of people keep looking at pre pandemic highs for these value rotations.

AMC is essentially bankrupt at this point and a lot of dumb money is giving the Wanda Group a way out of a bad and dumb situation.

Cinemark is in a better position.

I think you entirely misunderstand media; and Netflix in general.

The majority of streams on Netflix is television content. Serial shows. Films are only a small part of it.

Films are a little more important to Disney + and HBO, but not by much.

Server side of the industry tends to be the most lucrative. AMD margins on server cpus could potentially suffer from the chip shortage more unlike Intel.

I really like the leadership at AMD right now and think they probably have good plans, which they have proven over the last few years. Yet I'm much more unsure of the efficacy of their strategy than before.

Cineworld might be a bit too risky for me. They look to be on the brink of insolvency. Even prior to COVID, 2019 current ratio of 0.3 pretty much indicates they would be having problems meeting short term obligations.

It also appears they may not be able to meet upcoming long term debt covenants. It requires Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA of below 5.5x by June. To me, they’re not going to meet this.

AMC lucked out and was able to raise a large amount of cash via a stock offering during their meme stock runup. I'm not so sure Cineworld will have the same luck. It’ll be interesting to see what kind of bailout package they may receive and how long creditors will continue to give them leeway.

54,IP," I want to point out that the TTM (ending november 2020) EPS on GW is 2.99 which puts their P/E at a much more reasonable ~32, especially considering that they closed their operations more or less entirely for some time last spring. 

I think that price is well justified considering how solid a business they are, here are some tidbits:

* likely to do well in an inflationary environment due to great pricing power and ~40% RoE (TTM, based on after tax profit), while having no debt and having increased their cash buffer to 96.5 million in cash, which is more than half their equity

* Business model has a great moat, with low chance of being made obsolete by technological disruptions

* High margins and high profit ""throughput"" from revenue: in the last 6 months they had 49% overall margin despite royality income decreasing for that period, and a revenue growth of 38,4 million which translated into 33 million in pre tax income growth

* ""Our internal measures are being met with the exception of ‘out of stocks’ which are currently running higher than we’d like."" - from their last report

* High payout ratio of roughly 2/3, while still achieving considerable growth, 10% profit growth in their last annual report even though that included the time they closed their operations; in the latest 6 months 56% yoy pre tax profit growth, 97% yoy growth of net cash generated from operations (probably includes some pent up demand from their closure though, so keep that in mind)

With all that said (and there's probably more that could be said) there are of course also some risks and uncertainties:

* How much of an effect did covid have? Is the growth just a result of people being at home more and having time to paint etc. or is this growth permanent? Perhaps even precipitating future growth as people have gottten back into the hobby? Or will people switch to other ways to spend their time once other hobbys and leisure activities are available again?

* There's definitely a good chance that they will not achieve the same level of growth going forward. However even a more moderate level of growth should be fine given an expensive but not insane P/E of 32 (again, keep in mind that this includes the closed operations period and lots of shop closures in various countries).

* Despite their strong intellectual property, there is of course always the possibilty of it slowly falling out of favor for other sci-fi/fantasy IP

* Brexit

TL;DR: I think that Games Workshop, **at its current price**, is a great long term investment, given

Assets to reduce a Portfolio‘s market risk

I was going over my portfolio today and realised that I‘ve put quite some time and effort into trying to diversify it and reduce market risk. However I‘ve seen that my returns have a 0.85 correlation coefficient with the S&amp;P500, which I guess is nice when you have high returns, less so when the market crashes like in the Corona Crash of March 2020.

Now my question: 

*What assets do you guys use to „flatten“ your returns / reduce market risk? How much cash do you have on the sidelines?*

I don‘t really want to have any short exposure in my portfolio due to borrowing fees and the potentially infinite losses (I wouldn‘t want to be in a [stock that shall not be named]-like short position and seeing it go from 40 - 400 in a matter of days). I‘m rather looking for some commodity like assets whilst still maintaining relatively high returns, fixed income isn‘t really appealing to me either.

I personally was thinking of increasing my exposure to:

**1.) Uranium** via Yellowcake Plc - Nuclear power will be around for some time and afaik the Biden administration is making a push towards cleaner energy (I‘m not American so I‘m not really following that on the daily). Also from a geopolitical PoV the areas in which Uranium is mined have rather high geopolitical risks tied to them which in turn creates a scarcity in supply. This is a pretty nice [read](https://grayscale.co/financial-advisors-toolkit/) on that topic.

**2.) REITs** especially ones in APAC (for example CapitaLand - have a small position there) as there are countless studies showing the importance and relevance of the „Rising Asian Middle Class“ and they have relatively high returns and dividends considering the fact that it‘s Real Estate and not some growth stock. They‘re also partially invested in Europe (just closed a deal this week to buy 11 data centers in Europe).

Do you guys see any other geographical areas with relatively low risk and high growth potential (Any specific ETFs/REITs perhaps)? I feel like the USA and EU are kind of „done“ in terms of Real Estate growth.

**3.) Crypto currencies** via some Grayscale ETF (not sure which one yet - they‘re talking about releasing a very broad one which would include ADA and some other lesser known cryptos - might give that one a go or just go for the Grayscale Digital Large Cap one which includes BTC, ETH, LTC weighted by respective market caps) as I‘m under the impression that people these days are rather going into that space rather than Gold.

I hate to say it but I truly believe that it might replace gold as a store of value. Exhibit A: Huge market sell-off the past days and a few weeks ago - Gold price barely increased whilst cryptos such as BTC hit new all-time highs. I guess we‘ll have to adapt.

I hate to say it but I truly believe that it might replace gold as a store of value. Exhibit A: Huge market sell-off the past days and a few weeks ago - Gold price barely increased whilst cryptos such as BTC hit new all-time highs. I guess we‘ll have to adapt.

Farfetch stock price has already grown massively in the past year due to investors betting on the pandemic driving sales and partnering with Alibaba and Richemont . Though, it's my belief that they're still undervalued given that their business model delivers stock from B&M retail stores to the customer and takes a nice commission from these stores.

MyTheresa just recently had their IPO and haven't seen much growth yet but could pick up once their debt from decoupling with previous owners, now bankrupt, Neiman Marcus. MYTE is one of the few online retailers that has been profitable though their model is more traditional.

95,NIO," Now is as good a time as any to remind folks of the widespread Chinese Reverse Merger Fraud that prevailed in the US market ten years ago: https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&ei=0qFSYMKQD5amtQb98JDYBw&q=china+reverse+merger+fraud&oq=china+reverse+merger+fraud&gs_lcp=ChNtb2JpbGUtZ3dzLXdpei1zZXJwEAMyAggAMgUIABDNAjIFCAAQzQI6BAgAEEc6BAgAEA1QyDhYt05g0FFoAHABeACAAXiIAbQLkgEENC4xMJgBAKABAcgBCMABAQ&sclient=mobile-gws-wiz-serp

Also, a primer on Variable Interest Entity (VIE) structure, which adds extra layer of risk on foreign investors: 

As a foreign investor, Chinese law restricts you from outright owning a share or stake in a Chinese company (many of which are state-owned). Enter the VIE structure: a Chinese company establishes a wholly-owned subsidiary (often in the Cayman Islands), which then is the company that is listed on a foreign exchange, allowing foreigners to invest. Foreign investors are not buying a stake in the Chinese company; instead, they are buying a contractual promise that the Chinese company will share its earnings and profits with the Cayman subsidiary, which then will be passed on to the investor. https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&source=hp&ei=s0X7X-WdB8fWtQbdhpCADg&q=vie+chinese+companies&oq=vie+chinese+companies&gs_lcp=ChFtb2JpbGUtZ3dzLXdpei1ocBADMgUIABDJAzIGCAAQFhAeOgsIABCxAxDHARCjAjoECAAQAzoICAAQxwEQowI6BQguELEDOgIIADoFCAAQsQM6CggAELEDEIMBEAo6CAgAELEDEIMBOgIILjoFCAAQkgM6CwgAEMcBEK8BEMkDOggIABDHARCvAToECC4QCjoICAAQFhAKEB46BQghEKABUP8mWMFLYO1MaABwAHgAgAGNAYgB0xGSAQUxMC4xMZgBAKABAbABAA&sclient=mobile-gws-wiz-hp

Now let’s say NIO gets pumped; a lot of foreign money flows into it. The CCP then turns around and says, “Great, NIO has a lot of foreign money, pull the plug on the VIE and nullify the contracts.” Now the Chinese company has all your money, and you likely have no judicial recourse or remedy like you’d have here with a pump-and-dump in the States.

And if you don’t think the CCP would do such a thing, remember, in 1997, they signed a treaty to honor the Hong Kong system until the 2047. They went into Hong Kong via the National Security Law anyway, in breach of the treaty.

Think Darth Vader to Lando in Cloud City: “I am altering the deal, pray I do not alter it further.” That’s the CCP.

Also, the pattern of forced JVs with SoEs as a condition to doing business in China. Here is how the Chinese government historically has treated foreign companies. What follows is a key excerpt from https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/2020/01/15/business/china-technology-transfer.amp.html

“China has repeatedly shown that it can acquire technology and, through heavy government subsidies, build competitive rivals to American companies. Businesses worry that it could do the same in other industries, like software and chips.

China has long denied that it forces foreign companies to give up technology. They do it willingly, Beijing asserts, to get access to China’s vast and growing market. Still, Chinese officials say they are taking steps to address the concerns.

...

American companies say Chinese companies also use more subtle tactics to get access to valuable technology.

Sometimes China requires foreign companies to form joint ventures with local firms in order to do business there, as in the case of the auto industry. It also sometimes requires that a certain percentage of a product’s value be manufactured locally, as it once did with wind turbines and solar panels.

The technology companies Apple and Amazon set up ventures with local partners to handle data in China to comply with internal security laws.

Companies are loath to accuse Chinese partners of theft for fear of getting punished. Business groups that represent them say Chinese companies use those corporate ties to pressure foreign partners into giving up secrets. They also say Chinese officials have pressured foreign companies to give them access to sensitive technology as part of a review process to make sure those products are safe for Chinese consumers.

Foreign business groups point to renewable energy as one area where China used some of these tactics to build homegrown industries.

Gamesa of Spain was the wind turbine market leader in China when Beijing mandated in 2005 that 70 percent of each wind turbine installed in China had to be manufactured inside the country. The company trained more than 500 suppliers in China to manufacture practically every part in its turbines. It set up a plant to assemble them in the city of Tianjin. Other multinational wind turbine manufacturers did the same.

The Obama administration questioned the policy as a violation of World Trade Organization rules and China withdrew it, but by then it was too late. Chinese state-controlled enterprises had begun to assemble turbines using the same suppliers. China is now the world’s biggest market for wind turbines, and they are mostly made by Chinese companies.“

In sum, if you are going to invest in Chinese companies for the long-term--even the big, less risky ones--please do be aware if you are a foreign investor that you are facing increased political and regulatory risks you likely don't face by investing in other parts of the market.",RomulusAugustus753,1,/r/investing/comments/m9adbw/understanding_chinas_economy_the_embedded_risks/grmrbg0/,0.038,0.909,0.053,0.7391

I’ve made some big realized capital gains and lost it all, and then earn it back with the gains I had left by reinvesting.

I used RH for my broker of course and can’t make sense of my account summary reports. Any tips on how to calculate how much I could owe so far for some peace of mind?

117,AAPL," I had this very same conversation with myself in the past while looking at the ceiling before going to sleep. If all went to hell, where to keep my money safe?.

It depends, I'd then say. Are we talking ""Economy goes to hell worldwide"" scenarios? well, you can't eat bills and you can't drink gold, so land, cattle, seeds and tools (weapons too if you are american) :P

If we aren't talking apocalypse, but, say, Tulipmania, 1929, Black Thursday levels of econ-crisis, then I'd say nothing will do, but real state is possibly the best deal (least worst, if that's a thing) since no matter what you do, you have to live somewhere, and if there is a major crisis and loans/mortgages get a hit, people will not be able to buy anymore, so they will absolutely have to rent. Stocks are out of question unless they are blue chips (utility companies, you'll still need to put gas on your car, internet is too big of a thing now, etc etc). If you have to go haywire in the middle of a recession and cut down on everything, you'll cut on spending starting with non essentials. Consumer product producers will take a hit, even giants like AMZN or AAPL (no one needs an Iphone when having to go to food banks). I think we get the idea.

The real question is, are we talking ANOTHER crisis like the ones we use to have every decade or so like a clock, or will this be the first crisis on a world scale on proportions so devastating that nothing on the history books will be comparable? Then we will have to stop talking about what happened in the past and how we dealt with it before (remember what you did in 2008?) and start talking about how bad would that big bang be.

Say the USD devalues itself into the ground. I might be way off on this one, but I think as much as 40% of US debt is in the hands of China. If the USA debased their currency by, say, 50% (or worse, defaulted), could there be a war over payments?. A contagion would be very likely, so if that spreads into competitive devaluations like in the interwar period, we could see some really nightmarish scenarios. At that point, I can only speculate.

There is an old proverb that goes ""if you own 1 gold, you are in trouble with your bank, if you own 100000000 gold, the bank is in trouble with you"". If everybody bankrupts left right and center and nobody repays their debts at once, in what place would that place us? back to bartering?

I can see gold becoming very popular when qubit computers become mainstream.

Of course quantum computing is looking many years ahead. One day it will be a reality and then investing and cryptocurrency as we know it may crash financial sectors.

If someone tomorrow could use a qubit computer for mining they could mine every bitcoin in 10 minutes. The upside, a new currency would be born, Qubit Coins. I'm already telling people to buy Qubit Coins as soon as they become a thing. I'll be like 80 years old then.

The Steve Jobs of the Qubit computer hasn't even been born yet. Back in the 50's computers were used only by institutions like universities etc. now, everyone has one. The same thing will be true of qubit computers, it's just a matter of time.

Financial institutions will start shedding their crypto positions well in advance and the price will start to unravel. If cryptocurrency falls, it's going to fall harder than the financial crisis that nearly took out foreign banks and crashed world economies, but of course that won't happen for at least another 20+ years, or maybe sooner?
