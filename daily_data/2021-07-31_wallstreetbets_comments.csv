28,INTC," The thing is that they don't necessarily have to catch up immediately they just need to be good enough to still sell their chips. Obviously everyone wants to be the best in class chip maker but the market is constantly growing and it takes years to get new fabs going. TSMC won't be able to make enough chips to meet demand and even if that means Intel's customers are settling for second best they would still rather have second best than nothing at all. 

So then the question becomes not what will Intel's success look like in the next few years but instead what will it look like in the next 10. A lot can happen in 10 years (as evidenced by their more recent struggles.) Personally I think with all of the resources at their disposal that it is absurd to discount them and compared to their earnings and potential INTC is pretty cheap.",IKnowGuacIsExtraLady,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ov5y5f/gotta_love_the_deus_ex_machina_saving_my_portfolio/h78o1ii/,0.01,0.8,0.19,0.9875

70,UWMC," /u/Fun-Marionberry-2540

You did this for a 26% return? I mean, fuck, you could just find high dividend yield stocks and then sell monthlies and get a 12-18% return depending on how aggressive you are selling way out of the money options.

I mean i literally sold 5 cent calls at a strike of 14 for August 20 on UWMC. The stock is in the mid to high 7's. And it's not going to 14 in a month. And even selling 5 cent options continuously, with the dividend my yield through premium and dividends would be 13.33% for the year. I could sell way OTM 10-15 cent options and super charge that, and just wait for dividend increases to add to that yield too.

And I own the underlying on top of that so even if I bought on margin i know the companies not going bankrupt. 

I just... Man. I hope you learned a lesson every trader needs to go through which is that 1) risk management is important, and 2) position sizing matters. 

I mean even if you had diversified your portfolio so that you had 5 positions where the risk was the same, you would have been much better off. It would have given you the peace of mind to let it ride through, because the chances of a slight recovery from -7.5% is better than it going down further to get assigned. (And even if you get assigned you could then wheel it with piece of mind). Keeping an eye on the margin maintenance line and setting it so it never gets triggered or near to triggered is important.

I mean, I'm not trying to beat you around the head man, but giving constructive feedback is important.

97,XPO," A story about Wayfair - The company I quit last week had a contract with Wayfair that stated if an item booked for shipment did not ship on that day, Wayfair would charge us 20% of the items value, cancel the item, then reorder under a new pick ticket.  

With shipping the way it is, its quite hard to get all the trucking companies to show up in a day, especially for LTL, So over the last four months the problem has snowballed exponentially to the point where I guess Wayfair is bleeding this company dry in cancelation fees, and they have an entire department dedicated to Wayfair.  They brought me in in month 3.  I literally dipped out the back office door an hour into my shift 30 days later after I got threatened by my supervisor for XPO not showing the day prior.  He was almost crying he was so frustrated.  

In the week prior to me ghosting them, he had stopped calling it Wayfair.  He had to call it ""pinche Wayfair verga weyyyyyyy"" and his supervisor would come in to our office THREE TIMES A DAY to talk to us about how Wayfair was murdering the company.

187,OCGN," Anti-vaccine and electoral madness aside, is anyone else feeling like mRNA vaccines are beginning to look like a bit of a con job? Why weren’t inactivated virus vaccines given EUA? The data from Israel, whose vaccine strategy was very much like ours, suggests  the effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine is reduced by 1/2 every 3-4 weeks. Now, I’m not saying that there are dishonest players in big pharma who used their lobbying clout to get Pfizer a 27B deal for a questionable product, but it seems as Pfizer lobbyists perhaps used their clout in DC to get a 27B deal for a questionable product, and now they are pushing for booster shots for a vaccine that perhaps doesn’t work that well. 

Inactivated Virus vaccines create t-cells that can ward off infection potentially for years. Also, antivax people can’t shout weird things about genetic modifications with these vaccines. 

What I’m saying, actually, is I’m buying OCGN calls on Monday. Covaxin is likely getting WHO approval this month, they have a manufacturing plant set up in US,  they have the right to sell in Canada who will perhaps provide doses to the rest of the world.

190,FL," I agree that this isn't the black swan event and that delta won't cause a major crash, but rather could cause turbulence in some areas... I also agree that they won't do a full lockdown again and that people aren't in the state of mind for that kind of thing.  


It is not true that the lockdown caused more damage than the virus could have, though. Not even remotely. I do economic projection professionally and the kinds of systemic factors we were looking at at the start of the pandemic were things like 5-10% of the truckers in the country contracting it without controls in placing during the summer and that causing a major supply chain issue, and those issues were amplified across the board. The R and spread profile we used turned out to be close to accurate to COVID in the wild and predictive, too. The follow-on data has proven the point out here in the United States, where some states acted and others didn't to control the virus. Ignore news footage of busy bars in FL last year, objectively their economy shit the bed, while CA's economy did really, really well.   


But doesn't the fact that FL and other states that didn't enact major controls prove that economies would have been OK? Nope, because the major localities of FL did enact controls even as DeSantis was fighting them on it, and mobility dropped because people selected to not engage in old economic and social patterns and most adopted the recommendations to mask and social distance. CA also had places that refused to enact protocols to control the virus and became hot zones. Also, controller states and counties became sinks for the spreader counties, where you can see clear patterns in the data for how low infection-rate counties reduced the rise in virus cases in adjacent counties relative to counties that did not due to less infection opportunity potential. Basically, what the data says is that here in the United States controlling states/counties/towns protected towns without pandemic controls.  


You only say that because you don't really know what the economy would have looked like had it been fully open and people acted like normal... it would have been a shitshow. It's only OK because they acted.",Moist_Lunch_5075,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ovc65q/the_black_swan_is_coming/h78lzv8/,0.065,0.827,0.108,0.955

Death and hospitalisation are not the only dangers of getting covid. The virus damages the lungs, heart and brain. So far that looks like potential increased likelihood of developing Alzheimer's and inability to focus/generally lower brain function (I don't want to say IQ but basically it makes you a bit dumber than you were before) as well as breathing and heart problems. And then there's the damaged immune system. No more ""I never get sick because I played in the dirt as a kid"".

Comments:
(1) I thought the SAVA data looked pretty good considering the state of the union in the Alzheimer current treatments that are actually out now. Not perfect, but pretty good. Fraud risk is always non-zero risk with data as good as theirs was this week, but funny enough my impression of likelihood of full-on Theranos-type behaviour decreases, when data is believably pretty good but not perfect.

(2) Cassava could use a better marketer for their PowerPoint slides. I can understand their data since biochemist / medicine background but man, need to not bury the lead in some of those graphs and slides. There is a valid criticism of big pharma spending too much on marketing vs R&D, but for items like this, Cassava would do well to drop a few nickels of their cash hoard into a more clear presentation for non technical people, or perhaps make one for the scientists at the conference and one for non-scientists.

(3) The announced Annovis data was not really better than placebo, wiping 60% off AVIS valuation (which I do not hold and never did). There are some training algorithms that likely running without human intervention that just buy / sell competitors based on one stocks movement, which if it even just works just a net 51% of the time is the reason why the trading algorithm continues. 

(4) I increased my existing SAVA position by another 1/3 when stock into 60s on Friday after AMZN tank likely forced some margin calls for others larger participants. I am not a YOLOer though and comfortable with multi-month/year horizons for something like Alzheimer treatments. This is also not a sole holding, with lots of lower risk, diversified items as well.",BrainsNotBrawndo,5,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ouuoi4/sava_hit_piece_uncovered/h77jhpi/,0.093,0.732,0.175,0.9824

Thats less boy friends than y'alls' wives have. This study is underpowered PERIOD. Now, that being said TWO of the patients in one of the drug arms didnt have the med present in the samples, likely meaning they didnt even take the drug. Furthermore, the end point of the study had a minimal amount of patient oriented outcome data. Meaning that they could find the spice melange in their CSF but that dont mean shit.

They administered a ""mini mental status exam"" that is basically a quick bedside test to asses the likelihood of whether or not dementia is present. The granularity of an improving test is NOT meant to test the progression or regression of the disease state itself. 

Again, this is a stastically insignificant and underpowered study that did NOT appear to me to prove superiority to placebo. But the lack of power is the reason. This means that no conclusion can be made for or against. These people's brain mass are gone, never to return, much like ours.

210,ARE," So here’s why you don’t know what you’re talking about: you didn’t read the article and you’re latching onto a slight mistake OP made. This tells me you are blowing hot air out your rear end. Its ok, we’re all autists here.

1) The article OP linked says that “Open Label” study of 50 patients is flawed. The exact wording is such: 

“Cassava said 50 patients with Alzheimer’s treated with simufilam for nine months showed an average improvement of three points on a 70-point cognition scale known as ADAS-cog.“ “But Cassava conducted its clinical trial without a placebo control arm, meaning the company lacks any data to compare directly against simufilam.” 

2) OP made an error because it is true this “Open Label” study had no placebo. OP linked phase 2 results.

3) The article is incorrect when it claims that this design invalidates the results of the study. In fact it does not. SAVA never claimed more than it could. In particular, SAVA emphasized that “Open Label” study “derisks phase 3” studies it has planned - which ARE powered for final testing on efficacy. 

4) Phase 2 was powered for evaluating safety. It was not underpowered. FDA approved go ahead for phase 3.

5) MMSE, used in phase 2, is a well studied and reputable test to measure short term changes in cognition. ADAS-Cog, the gold standard, was used in the “Open Label” study. ADAS-cog is a combination if questions and simple tasks. MMSE is widely used to test for cognition. Guess how people are diagnosed with Azheimer’s today? Through some form of questionnaire as a first screening.

So - your failure to pick up on the error OP made indicates you didnt read the article. Your mischaracterization of Phase 2 study as underpowered is incorrect. Calling MMSE a “quick bedside test” ignores the fact that it is well studied and reputable.

at the congressional meeting, robinhood's ceo, lied about having a liquidity issue.  so here's the thing, when the short squeeze occurred, the DTCC didn't want to take on the inane volatility risk the equity presented, so they ended up raising the maintinence margin to 100%, causing smaller, less capitalized brokers being inable to put up the maintainence margin, which is why you saw TDA, Webull, and Robinhood disable buying the equity.",codingIsCancer,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ove1iv/people_who_shorted_hood/h78qfcr/,0.062,0.877,0.061,-0.0572

I will try to provide a DD with some TA incorporated like what you have - in the next few days ish.

249,DD," I don't agree with a lot of OP's work. It's not bullish enough.

BUT, aside from my DD, you cannot ignore how correlated it is with Hang Seng.

The Chinese indexes share a lot of overlap.

It means all the China stocks are reflecting the state of China itself. I would not bet on China falling just the same as I would not bet on the US falling",_Professional,4,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ov3dh3/iqiyi_iq_technical_analysis/h76wr7z/,0.078,0.843,0.079,0.2755
250,TAL," Yep this. The US attacks on Chinese stocks have always been temporary. If Chinese stocks were to ever collapse it will ultimately be the doing of the CCP.  Anybody who follows China stocks will know that the CCP has caused numerous negative impacts on China stock. Some noticeable examples that I can think of are the video game restriction that hurt tencent/netease, private education ban that destroyed TAL and others, and the anti-monopoly enforcements that prevented huya/douyu merger.

China stocks are definitely very risky but damn nobody can deny the absolute discount these stocks are selling at.",Hophop1228,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ov3dh3/iqiyi_iq_technical_analysis/h78840v/,0.209,0.75,0.041,-0.9489
