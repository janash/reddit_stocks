9,CTXR," Dumped a couple more small cap plays that I am not expecting anything out for a quite a while as the opportuntiy cost for the money I had tied up in them was just getting too high at this point. I'd rather have raw cash sitting as usable ammunition in my portfolio now than have it tied up those positions any longer. No penny stock seems to have a safe support floor anymore so even 1 day flips off support bounces are now a dangerous game to play.

At this point I am just holding CTXR cause May's around the corner and TRCH cause I basicaly stuck with it until the merger and dividend come through.",OKJMaster44,6,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/mv3w3e/daily_discussion_thread/gva88pd/,0.083,0.809,0.108,0.4522

22,AIG," Berkshire basically helped bailout Goldman in the financial crisis, making a $5B investment in the company. Goldman got $13B from the AIG bailout and $10B from the TARP bailout. Berkshire was the largest shareholder in Bank of America at the time, which received $25B from the TARP bailout.

23,NAK," My favorite ""worst"" penny stock so far has been NAK:

In September 2020, the Environment Investigation Agency (an international NGO that investigates and campaigns against environmental crime and abuse) released recordings in which NAK executives secretly revealed that the company intended the Pebble Project to be far bigger than publicly represented.

The people from the EIA posed as potential investors in the mine and conducted zoom calls in which NAK executives detailed how they sought to curry favor with Alaskan senators and the Trump's white house chief of staff.  

NAK currently has a class action lawsuit on their hands *FROM THEIR OWN INVESTORS* for making false/misleading statements about the Pebble Project vis a vis Clean Water Act guidelines and project size and duration. 

Northern Dynasty and it's former CEO, who resigned in September after being recorded on said zoom calls, have been served subpoenas in relation to a grand jury investigation apparently involving the recordings of the private conversations.",Itsboomhomie,1,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/mvomes/worst_companies_in_the_various_markets/gvda6ie/,0.044,0.888,0.068,0.6124
