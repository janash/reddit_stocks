0,APPN," I have paid for the services stock advisor and rule breakers to test the service back in 2018 to see how it would go. My opinion is that overall it is a great place to get stocks on your radar and help make decisions.

Not all of the stocks did as well tho such as Luckin Coffee. Which I luckily did not invest in. I think even when you factor in the losers it would only take one SHOP or NFLX (another one of their early recs before I had the service) to balance out the losses.

In particular would be two you mention.  DCA and ""you can't time the market"".

 DCA is widely misunderstood, and wildly overrated.  For anyone who has done calculus, you'll know DCA only gives a benefit in one very specific kind of profile curve, one that's not necessarily going to be there for you.  

It was devised by the investment sales industry who were desperate to influence customers into feeding them endless streams of regular cash influx that they wouldn't have to do the sales work to attain.  By wrapping their goal for perpetual commission into a mumbo jumbo ""strategy"", you've hooked the client emotionally and mentally.  They've made it so the customer thinks he's achieving some missing, but mainly he's padding their paycheck.  They also love that DCA serves as a wonderful defence against clients angry at poor performance.  At first, DCA is used to mollify them.  But once brainwashed, clients convince *themselves* about DCA.

Don't misunderstand me.  Making investing a regular habit is good.  The more the better.  The earlier in life the better.  The larger share of your income the better.  But a beneficial DCA program is pretty limited, and the illustrations used to promote it are maddeningly unrealistic and deceptive.  

Next point is slightly related, but even more deceptive of the industry.  ""You can't time the market"" is the biggest lie in the entire financial environment.  It's false.  The players who always say it are the same ones who absolutely do try to time the market, and they do so every hour of every day.  

Think about it: who pushes that BS saying the most?  Banks, insurance companies, hedge funds, investment managers, sovereign wealth, traders, financial firms.  And guess who spends billions trying to time the markets 24x7?  All those same players.

Can you time the market?  Hell yes.  Not every day, not at all.  But the big moves?  Certainly.  Easily.  You need to have capital ready of course, and pay attention.  But when DIS went to $70-odd dollars last year, I bet even you thought about timing the markets.  When BAC was hitting $19 a year ago, anyone could see that's a good time to buy.  When that game retailer went up to nearly $400, anyone with a functioning mind knew that might a nice time to take profit. 

Just buying obvious corrections and selling obvious bubbles will do much more for you than DCA.  

Now think about who it is that's been telling you to ""you can't time the market"".  It's all people and companies whose whole existence revolves around timing the market *themselves*.  They're literally saying ""don't do the thing we do every day"".  

You time every other market in your life.  You look for deals after Black Friday.  You sell your house when the the RE market is hot and you try to get a better deal on car at month end.  When soup goes on sale, you buy a whole bunch of extra cans, and when gas prices shoot up on Independence Day, you decide you'll just wait til next week for the price to moderate before you fill up.  

So why not admit it, and just time the most important market, like you normally do with every other market and life choice?  Do so intelligently, not impulsively.  Pay attention.  Do your homework.  Sell on rips and buy on dips.  That's timing the market, and it's a very sane and profitable thing to do.

63,GME," I put a little bit into retirement every year, but I realized that I have a lot of extra cash that would be better invested than sitting in a savings account.  I'm a young guy and I had no idea what I was doing, was just putting a little bit into a target retirement fund periodically. The GME saga was the first time I bought a stock and I realized that I could be investing more than I was.

A gift from my dad, stimulus checks, lowered spending from Covid this year, plus a small salary increase all contributed as well.  Basically I was sitting on a lot of extra cash and at the same time getting interested in the stock market for the first time.

No, it wasn't $200,000 (I wish!), but it was about 10 times what I would normally put in in a single year.

Fact is, we ARE humans, and we can do whatever we want with our money. 

If I have a DCA strategy where I put $500 into ""bobs bobber LTD."" every two weeks (just an example), I can 100% choose to skip a period and double down next period, or even just wait a few days, Maybe they had a shortfalling on an earnings report, and I'm confident the price will dip. If that's the case, I don't give two shits what ""true"" DCA means, I'm gonna make what I believe is a smart move and buy the shares at a discount on the near future. 

Maybe it'll pan out, maybe it won't, but it is an opportunity that I deem very likely, and I would be stupid to act against that belief (so long as I believe in it enough), just because it's not what ""true"" DCA is. 

Now, if you start delaying your buy-ins for extended periods, then you've fully transitioned from DCA to timing the market.

I think they're will be huge dips which are buying opportunities. Someone mentioned the 2008 dip as a 6 month recovery.. Untrue. If you bought in tech or small cap at the height of the market, it would have taken 4 years to fully recover (still not bad).
A few things to consider with this market (from someone who has lived through the 2000 bubble burst) :
1) leverage (margin/debt/borrowings) of dangerous for bubbles... It creates a crash from a drop. We're at the highest leverage level ever. Highest corporate borrowing, highest margin leverage. Ever!
2) Fundamentals rule when panic ensues. You have companies like the meme stocks flying with 50% DE ratios and negative PEs. You have tesla (great co btw) trading at 1300 PE and valued at 5 times its competitors combined, yet earning 1/100th of their profits. It's nonsensical. And like in 99, they may fly high until they fly no more.
Most important reason for this long term bull market is a ridiculously lose fed policy. It will probably keep propping up the market for a while. But unlike the previous three major crashes, they do not have any more tools left of they're is another one within the next two years. We cannot and will not go rate negative. They can keep printing money for repost, but if nobody participates in repost besides the fed and the treasury, is that really a market? Will people participate in that ""market""?

I predict a painful crash followed by more insane upside.... When and how long, I wish I knew. But it's coming.

BTW, tell tell sign of impeding doom is credit markets freezing, which is why the fed always supports the credit markets first.",dejonese,1,/r/stocks/comments/oda8gp/does_the_stock_market_just_go_up_forever/h41yh5m/,0.148,0.736,0.116,-0.9229

71,TV," Most of my investments were down between 30 and 40% when I started buying more.  I remember being in my car and on the way to work and listening to a radio show where they were saying we were on the verge of a Great Depression.  At that point I said out loud to myself in the car b)""f*** it, if we're all going down and we are all going to be broke and standing in bread lines then I'll go down with the ship.""

It just couldn't get any worse.

It actually did for me because the prices went down very quickly an additional 5 to 10% in most of my investments.  

I remember feeling pretty much at my worst and a gentleman named Mark Haynes came on the TV and called the bottom.  They called it the Haynes bottom  He was on CNBC at the time and I think within a year or two he passed away but he almost called the bottom perfectly and yes it was by chance but it was so cool when it happened.  

It was also around that week that I heard Warren Buffett's old quote that went something like be fearful when others are greedy and be greedy when others are fearful and everyone was terrified at that moment.   

That's when I took any change I could find to the bank, empty the few hundred dollars I had in savings, and bought the safest companies I could find an additional to the company's already owned like Procter & Gamble, General Electric, Walmart etcetera.   

It all paid off but there was a few weeks there where I was almost losing my lunch when I came home and saw the market open down.

But I see a supply side glut if demand drops while inflation is high. No telling what demand will really do but could if it remains difficult to hire people and UI continues to compete with wages. Or if inflation outpaces value. The progressive leaning folks in DC want to be able to roll out a new deal style solution to push through an agenda and create an infrastructure they support. (Right or wrong on the issue, politics are irrelevant). It's also how UI is being propped up to support a $15 minimum wage.

88,TD," I have enough for day to day expenditures in a checking account that I have linked to direct deposit.  A savings account with a 6 month emergency fund.  A pre-tax 401k that I drop 27% of each paycheck into.  And a TD trading account that I add a few hundred into each month and am using to trade towards a down payment on a house in 3-5 years and retirement hopefully as soon as my late 50s, but I would settle for mid 60s if it meant putting 2-3 (future) kids through college.

Biggest holdings in my portfolio are $AAPL, $SBUX, $AMD, $QQQ, $VOO, $WM, $AMZN, and $TSLA (bought 10 shares a few years ago at $170 pre split and held).  I'm dabbling in some other tickers, but those are all small percentages compared to these.

The percent I'm dropping into my 401k is a bit high (generally you hear 10-20%, but I'm not paying rent at the moment so I want to take advantage).  Common sentiment seems to be if you take a similar approach after paying down any credit card debt you are in a good position.  **My thought process is that I have what I need access to immediately and without being taxed on in the bank (day to day and 6 month fund) and everything beyond that gets put into the market in some form so my money can work for me.**  If thats my 401k, fine.  If thats my TD account, fine.  Either way its gonna sit there and work towards making me more money since I'm not using it and the interest rate in my savings account is piss poor.

91,NIO," There are tonnes of different ‘Rules’ you can live by, but i guess it always comes down to the individual and what you can afford to do. If you’re planning on buying a house next year, then it wouldn’t be wise to go above a 1/3. But, if you’re not planning on buying a house and are just stacking cash, then investing more strategically will potentially return you more, for when you want to buy. Personally that’s what i have done over the years, I’ve had exposure to 45% of net worth in Stocks and 25% in Crypto. Of course there’s always a risk, but Banks give next to nothing and inflation is 2% on average. So even if you’re making 10-15% throughout the year, it’s a hell of a lot more than you have returned if your cash is just waiting, just my opinion! Wish you the best Young Man.

113,IBKR," Yes,  this is how this works.  Buying a call is (basically) like buying 100 shares, at the strike price, with the ""option"" to do so. I don't know what broker you are using, but if it isn't ""Robbin Hoods,"" they should have some good education stuff on this.

IBKR has a good trader education website that doesn't require an account to use if you do happen to be using a cheap broker.  Below is the link to their basic option strategies that may be helpful.  (non affiliate, I just think their content is good.)

I sell a covered call with a strike of 42 which is fairly close to the current price of 40 and could be at risk of assignment. You could also hold 100 shares of the same stock but you want to hold it longer so you may look to sell the covered call with a strike of 46.

It is a number of things. ""Just looking at charts"" under sells it. 

It's identifying trends. Example, look at the BABA weekly chart and you can draw an uptrend line from $130 in January 2019 until now and see that it's a straight uptrend line which gets tapped but respected each time.

It is identifying price levels of support/demand (it keeps getting bought up at that level and doesn't want to go lower), or price levels of resistance/supply (it keeps getting sold at this level, can't break through).  Example AMD bouncing off of $70 demand zone repeatedly last year but could not break through $100. Supply and demand zones can help determine entry and exit. 

It is identifying chart patterns such as bull flags - there is a violent breakout upwards, and it continues to consolidate without breaking down, you can draw lines marking new supply and demand. Example, look at AMZN bouncing between 2900 and 3500 the past year after a violent move up from 1600.

It's using indicators like moving averages to determine support or resistance. A golden cross is is the 50-day moving average crosses up and over the 200 day moving average. It is a signal that the price action is ready for a bullish move up.

It can even be a day trader gaging where a 5 minute candle closes as an indicator of bull vs bear strength. 

Remember 80% of market volume is algos and institutions. So, market makers are living up to their name here by telling you where demand or supply is. You interpret their supply and demand by reading price action and indicators on charts. I.e. technical analysis.

You can make money by just fundamental analysis. Technical analysis will help you make better returns by not buying something near supply then being in the red for 5 months before the MMs are ready to let it move. You can put your money to work elsewhere until the technicals are ready to reflect the fundamentals. I think everyone should know TA basics.

It is identifying chart patterns such as bull flags - there is a violent breakout upwards, and it continues to consolidate without breaking down, you can draw lines marking new supply and demand. Example, look at AMZN bouncing between 2900 and 3500 the past year after a violent move up from 1600.

It's using indicators like moving averages to determine support or resistance. A golden cross is is the 50-day moving average crosses up and over the 200 day moving average. It is a signal that the price action is ready for a bullish move up.

It can even be a day trader gaging where a 5 minute candle closes as an indicator of bull vs bear strength. 

Remember 80% of market volume is algos and institutions. So, market makers are living up to their name here by telling you where demand or supply is. You interpret their supply and demand by reading price action and indicators on charts. I.e. technical analysis.

You can make money by just fundamental analysis. Technical analysis will help you make better returns by not buying something near supply then being in the red for 5 months before the MMs are ready to let it move. You can put your money to work elsewhere until the technicals are ready to reflect the fundamentals. I think everyone should know TA basics. You can make money with only TA and no FA. or you can make money with only FA and no TA.

163,TA," >yo sup technical analysis is just like looking at charts right?  
>I heard it should be part of your routine but not the only thing either.

It is a number of things. ""Just looking at charts"" under sells it. 

It's identifying trends. Example, look at the BABA weekly chart and you can draw an uptrend line from $130 in January 2019 until now and see that it's a straight uptrend line which gets tapped but respected each time.
