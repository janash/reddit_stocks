Yeah apparently he looked up Dad's obit, and went down the list threatening to sue everyone, including grandkids. One of whom was my UNBORN youngest daughter.

The look on their attorney's when that was played back deposition was priceless. Especially, when I told the guy, in total deadpan ""You realize you're going to lose your job for this, right?""",TuckandRoll91,11,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oucpbs/had_to_buy_it/h741lcz/,0.117,0.819,0.064,-0.7357

14,GME," Yes but it’s only a historical metric. It’s derived from regression. It’s basically the coefficient you multiply market performance by to get stock performance over a certain period of time. Beta’s meaningful for some stocks, and that regression may have statistical significance. You can be reasonably confident that a company like JnJ will move in the same direction as the market but with smaller moves. 

That doesn’t apply to stocks with hella idiosyncratic drivers (*cough* GME *cough*). I’d bet the r^2 is like .1 and the p value is crazy high for GME’s beta. Meaning it has very little explanatory value for the stock’s performance.

TLDR: Beta really doesn’t mean anything for many stocks, especially those primarily driven by non-macro factors.",Snazzymf,12,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oucpbs/had_to_buy_it/h72rar3/,0.023,0.78,0.198,0.9719

126,AMZN," Sept. -160k (for now) I am fucked though. I didn’t just buy them this week. I bought earlier so I have buys from 120 to 60. I got pulled into it heavily because my initial purchase went up to 160 I think quite soon and got euphoric. 


I usually don’t hold ER but thought the ride down before was going to recover so not holding would mean losing that gain. 


I was worried yesterday right before close and picked up a near money Put which screamed today but only about 20k gain. 


Sold rest of tech calls before earnings and bought back after. Up 200-300% before and locked in. Buy backs have since been down 30%, also Sept and 5% or so OTM at the time. Too early. Should have waited. 


What’s been working well for couple Q is to buy when we are 30-45 days to ER, 5-7% OTM with near BEP (otherwise premium overpriced), and ride the run up to earnings. Usually going with a 45-60 dte. 


So end of Oct should be next ER which means late / mid Sept I should buy calls for end of Oct or Nov. 


For you, depends strikes, Jan is a long time so I wouldn’t worry about them. Oct probably okay too because of the earnings run up.  Seems like AMZN is being coy with numbers to surprise next Q.

213,MVST," One prong of the bear case is that if you’re looking for a quick flip, don’t bank on this yielding immediate returns, especially given SPAC/de-SPAC stigma these last several months. I see MVST as a long-term play (been in since SPAC days starting last Nov), however it does have potential take off at the drop of a hat (macro tailwinds, patented tech, growing presence in multiple continents, fully-integrated, quickly-rising contractual revenue, and we don’t even know details on some of the largest marquee customers yet).

There’s going to be a ton of jockeying for market share in this space (plenty of new companies that are popping up and gaining awareness) so I see it as a considerable risk, with potential for massive rewards. Given that Microvast has a stellar product here and now (and isn’t just a PowerPoint pipe dream), I’m mostly focusing on how quickly they can scale and market/gain awareness. I need to remind myself to stay patient, but their relative lack of activity on the investor relations side of things (barring a small contract announcement yesterday) has left folks wanting a lot more.",botwrthy,27,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ouiyx9/microvast_mvst/h72upmy/,0.033,0.919,0.048,0.1406
214,MVST," They make commodity batteries. CATL eats their lunch in their motherland of China leaving them with low margin contract scraps. Also, China keeps cutting EV subsidies which has a direct impact on their gross margins. They've gone from 35% to 20% in a couple years and it doesn't look like it will get better. They are under pressure from their customers to deliver productivity savings to offset subsidy reductions which means they can't keep much of it for themselves. 

They don't have capacity to supply any of the major OEM's even if they wanted to. their planned capacity is miniscule, something like .5% of battery production in Europe, worse in China. With the chip shortage, OEM's are looking hard at their supply chains and are hesitant to commit to small producers like Microvast because any factory disruption shuts down the OEM. Larger battery manufacturers are able to move production around to maintain supply at least at some level.

 They are not working significantly on next gen solid state battery tech. They did a decade ago but have since largely abandoned it. The only comments coming from them about this tech is that they are working with materials in their existing batteries that *could be* used in solid state. They are well behind quantumscape and Solid Power in that regard. 

No one actually works in their Houston suburb ""HQ."" People on reddit have visited the office, not even a receptionist for a multinational manufacturing company. For a while the number for the US headquarters was Shane Smith's cell phone. They're using the address to dupe investors into believing it's an American company and it has worked for them. The DoD gave them money to build a plant in Tennessee for which MVST is investing nothing.

The stock has endured extremely volatile periods during this entire time. I can’t even recall how many times someone has said it was overvalued and couldn’t continue growing. That always seems to temporarily grab the headlines. I continue to hold the stock because I continue to think it is a great investment. I’m increasing my position as we speak.

QAnon types are probably stupidly betting on back to normal based on the assumption the virus is fake or something dumb like that.  Left-wing types are WAY too dogmatic about how awesome the vaccines are.  The vaccines are really awesome, but there are failure scenarios and the fact that it seems even very vaccine positive places can only manage to get about 80% of people vaccinated (not enough to quickly reach herd immunity) does not bode well.  Let alone the fact that all the poorer countries just won't get the vaccines anywhere near fast enough to prevent the possibility of new strains evolving.

344,HY," SPY PUTS are expensive look at HYG

HYG (High Yield or Junk Bond iShare ETF)

Within the bond market High have the highest correlation to stocks in price action and movement.  And while the moves in bonds are significantly less volatile these smaller moves move option prices like a mofo.  

The HYG is also a very liquid ETF & for that effect so are the options.  Cheaper and equally as effective way to play the SPY (again not gonna be a carbon copy but it gets the job done. Just need to play them much closer to the money or else it’s a losing bet). 

PS: this is also a perfect way to play a possible spike in yields.  Higher Rates kill bonds specially HY bonds (look at the chart and how it did in March of 2020 wow)",pdieff,10,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ouhpha/daily_discussion_thread_for_july_30_2021/h72ssjo/,0.08,0.81,0.11,0.3818

794,ICE," As long as they continue to make dumpster fires I’m not buying their stock, the engineering behind each vehicle (although still better than most legacy) is disgusting. 

If you want to bet on legacy (car builders) then yea Ford and VW are your best bet for mass market. If you want to buy a car making company Tesla is the way every time. 

Ford is still dependent on ICE sales and once the majority of people are buying EV their suppliers won’t be able to keep up, hurting delivery numbers, hurting revenues. If they can fully transition successfully to EV without dying from supplier constraints then buying now will work out in the long run.

Tesla is overvalued in comparison. Yes, in the automotive sector. Tesla will continue to grow its other parts of the business’ and will grow into its valuation soon, it is more speculative but has a higher chance of growth and domination in multiple sectors.

**SpotGamma Daily Report for: 07/30/2021 AM**

*""Today should be quite interesting. Futures are down to 4380, but up off of 4372(4378 SPX) which is our main support line for today. 4330 remains a major downside inflection point, and we think that would be todays low should larger selling ensue. To the upside we note resistance at 4405 and 4425. Only 8% of SPX gamma expires today, but 28% of SPY gamma expires which is large.""*

*""The gamma flip lines have pushed higher to the 4375 area from 4350. We think this is the result of ~14k short dated put options added to 4400 yesterday (therefore Monday this flip line likely changes sharply). The skew to the vanna model has shifted quite a bit from yesterday, too. This infers higher volatility today, and that a trip back to the 4420 area is just as quick as a visit lower. A close under 4400 is concerning for bulls, and under 4378 is a clear “risk off” signal into the weekend.""*

Chart 1:  https://imgur.com/gallery/wi8CAPD

*""We continue to think that the downside is capped near 4330 due to put positioning. If traders come out today looking for large hedges that could obviously change the picture – but that would have to be very strong demand. If we close near 4330 today that could be a stage for a second leg lower on Monday, with 4175 showing as the next major inflection line.""*

909,RKT," Q3 guidance will be in the dumper because the price war DOES actually affect all sides of the business. If shrinking margins in the wholesale channel get the consumer better rates, you can bet they won't bother with the retail channel. Unfortunately for both RKT and UWMC, this GOS margin war is expected to last through the end of the year at the very least, and possibly all the way through 2022 in the worst case scenario. Dan and Matt are INCREDIBLY competitive going all the way back to college so I don't think either of them are going to be too keen to blink first.

924,AMZN," After the UPS and AMZN earnings tanked, I knew that I had to chase this play.

DASH is currently trading near its IPO level price of $180 which was established during the height of the pandemic. As more and more people start to go out and reopening is in full force we have seen a couple factors which I believe will lead to disastrous results for DASH Earnings report on 8/12.

* Less and less people are staying inside and delivery purchases have crunched. This is apparent in UPS and AMZN ERs. Reopening is in full swing. Travel is up, and people are going out shopping and of course, eating out more often as well.
* Due to reopening and increased travel, oil prices have continued to rise, up about 15% from May this year. This results in less incentive for people to be DASH drivers as they have to pay for their own gas. Not only that, the US is currently in a labor crunch, with service industries desperately trying to increase their staff by offering higher wages, which stiffens DASH's competition for labor. DASH will have to follow up with paying its drivers more or raising fees.

All leading to horrid results, and that not even accounting for the inflated stock price, which compared to competitors like Just Eat Takeaway (who recently acquired Grubhub and aiming for aggresive US expansion) is trading multiple amounts greater that it should.
