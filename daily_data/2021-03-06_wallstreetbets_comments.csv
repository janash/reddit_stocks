Holy shit. I see where this is going.

My ignorance regarding options concealed this fact from me.

>It opens the game up to the ‚Äúretail‚Äù swarms that mobilized around GME on Reddit. They targeted the huge exposed short positions in GameStop (well over 100% of the company‚Äôs outstanding float). Where before it required major financial muscle to even attempt a corner or a short squeeze, now huge numbers of small traders can join the game. The tipping point is quickly overrun. The shorts were forced to cover.

Holding is only half the battle.

Isn't an issue then that some cannot afford the 100 share requirements of options contracts?

Do buyers necessarily require the ability to exercise the call contracts? While obviously preferable, if a potential buyer *hypothetically* found themselves unable to exercise one, wouldn't the effect of buying the option suffice to either:

1. Cause the writer/seller of said contract to buy shares to cover?

-or-

2. Tempt the writer/seller to create and sell a naked contract?

The key to the Gamma Squeeze is this: Call options are a much cheaper way to apply the pressure on the shorts. In this example, the option costs just 2% of the cost of buying a full share of Tesla. This tilts the game dramatically in favor of the orchestrators of the squeeze. With just 2¬¢ of at-risk investment, they can force the shorts to take on $1.00 of new risk. Even with the shorts‚Äô liquidity advantage, this is now a different battle. It opens the game up to the ‚Äúretail‚Äù swarms that mobilized around GME on Reddit. They targeted the huge exposed short positions in GameStop (well over 100% of the company‚Äôs outstanding float). Where before it required major financial muscle to even attempt a corner or a short squeeze, now huge numbers of small traders can join the game. The tipping point is quickly overrun.

They are now paying very closely to every word that is said here. They have humans and technology involved in the process. They are using this intelligence to trade against y'all. Look what happened to RKT. Y'all got played and are left holding the bags. 

Secondly, do you really think they are going to let you keep doing these games to counter their games? 

What do you think the last few days have been? They are doing vicious things to the market to shake out weak hands and margin call and destroy y'all. It worked for some of ya. But if shady trading techniques don't stop y'all from raining on their games with your games, the regulators will step in. And they will do things to make sure the process unwinds slowly and the big boys don't lose their shirts, but y'all will. 

And then they will implement rules to keep y'all from ruining the fun of the big boys. It could be something like, no more trading unless you have 200K cash or assets (bye most of you). It could be no more concentrating your portfolio into a strong yolo, meaning literally the brokerage will stop you from doing trades that will make a stock more than 10% of your portfolio. It could be that calls get regulated, especially for shorted stocks. There are plenty of ways the SEC will screw you to protect the big boys. 

You don't have to like my words, but think about it, do you really think the federal government is still government for the people, of the people, and by the people?

235,GME," Unless ETFs are also banned, it's difficult to see how this will help them. Apart from HFT'ing, institutions make their money off of (1) transaction fees, (2) management fees, and (3) wave-riding the markets (buying cheap, encouraging retail to get in and selling to them up the wave to the crest when purchasers dry up and the price falls, retail panics and sells to institutions on the way down who know the wave will rise again with a whole new band of retailers to baghold).

If you effectively ban retail day-trading then you lose a lot of (1) and a lot of (3). Retail would then only have shitty 2.5% mutual funds, or 0.05% passive indices to fall back on. With the inflows into ETFs and outflows from mutual funds, ETFs look the winners at present, which means a big cut into government short-term capital gain taxes, and into (2) for the institutions.

I'm not saying that they wouldn't also find a way to curtail or ban passive investing as well, especially in ETFs, but at some point the cure becomes worse than the disease. How much money can HFs really make competing with each other for fractions of a penny in HFT vs all the money they rip retail off of via (1), (2) and (3). Not to mention the damage it does to the image of the US markets if they overtly restrict it to rich people. If other markets around the world don't follow suit, why wouldn't American retail just start day-trading South Korean stocks or South African ones, then the government would have to ban foreign investing as well, and then you're in capital control territory and so on.

I agree that if GME tanks the markets that they'll blame us and institute new rules, but I'm not convinced yet that those rules will restrict retail trading so much as regulate it more closely to shave any advantages we may have, and how information is communicated (like on social media, risking SEC fines and so on) - not because they wouldn't love to do this, but because ultimately it is in their interests to keep stealing our money rather than herding us towards passive investing where it's a lot harder for them to earn off of us.",Phynaes,31,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lyysbc/the_stockmarket_crash_soon_will_be_blamed_on_us_i/gpz6njb/,0.125,0.796,0.079,-0.9706

284,SO," That was, most likely, retail piling at the same time naked calls were forced to delta hedge (a gamma squeeze). The shares were then shorted back down, hard, through ETFs and other means (some profits realized, to be sure, but I think most people were actually holding - and still are! - like heroes). Once the short squeeze well and truly starts, volume should go DOWN, not up - they will BEG for shares but MANY will simply not be sold until prices look like phone numbers. Even then, they owe SO MANY shares, that even if they cover the entire float, they still owe it all again multiple times over due to the synthetic long positions, if apes' calculations are correct.

&#x200B;

If hedge funds are FORCED to cover, and nobody will sell to them, what happens?

There is a very real possibility there will be no definitive squeeze and the shorts are covered over a long period of time while the price continues to rise like it is now. They have the option to pay interest and slowly exit their position over years. Whether they can afford that or not is up in the air. If nothing acts as a catalyst to quickly raise the price they will likely just slowly bleed money rather than initiate the squeeze.

292,GME," Nope. But they have brokers called prime brokers: https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/quarterly-bulletin/2017/q4/hedge-funds-and-their-prime-brokers-developments-since-the-financial-crisis

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_brokerage


""Large prime brokerage firms today typically monitor the risk within client portfolios through house-designed ""risk based"" margin methodologies that consider the worst case loss of a portfolio based on liquidity, concentration, ownership, macroeconomic, investing strategies, and other risks of the portfolio. These risk scenarios usually involve a defined set of stress test scenarios, rules allowing risk offsets between the theoretical profit and losses (P&Ls) of these stress test scenarios for products of a common underlier, and offsets between groups of theoretical P&Ls based on correlations.""

In the event of catastrophic losses, the prime broker would have to foot the bill. What if they also can't afford that?


Both are insured through other companies:

https://thehedgefundjournal.com/insurance-for-funds/

In the event of a systematic failure of the entire system to get back our precious GME to cover their now-unpayable debt, no one really knows what happens. Someone has to foot the bill at some point. Apes are assuming it could (theoretically) bankrupt the DTCC, which is the collection of big banks and firms and clearing houses which currently owns and controls all stock exchanged in the US and oversees all the transactions. More, when I say they *own* all the stock, it's because they're the actual stockholders - we are just temporary owners with financial rights to the stock.

Look at the historical option flow on cheddar or flowalgo.

Feb 25 right before the big pop, within 30MIN $32M worth of calls flashed across the screen with strikes ranging for 20-800. Delta hedging went into berserker mode, GME shot to 180 minutes later, I'm sure some shorts shit themselves as well.

March 4th, one hour or so before close, deep ITM $14M Strike 17-20c Mar19 hit within a 5min window sending it from 120 to 150-160ish instantly. Another $8M 400-800c hit as well, similar dates.

We have a guardian delta hedge angel buying up massive calls all over the spread every week.

324,GME," Thank you for writing a great explanation. However I would like to  disagree with your premise slightly. Options are based on volatility, time and price movement as you stated. Yes your 3/19 calls far OTM are worthless, but that‚Äôs because you aren‚Äôt accounting for time and volatility. I‚Äôm just trying to say that there is a time and place when options make a lot more sense. Stock price gains are linear but options are like a wave. You can buy options with longer expiration dates. Given that GME is highly
Volatile, you can make exponential gains without ever reaching the same targets with the stock. I agree that the safer bet would be to buy deep ITM call options because it offers the same opportunity at a lower capital requirement. However if you know options, the gains are much larger than stocks.

My 185 calls which I purchased when the stock was trading around at $50 is more than 1,200% up.

There is plenty of money to be made. Quit throwing 3,000 in hopes that you will time the moon landing.

Instead buy 30 shares and ride the wave up to 800 and beyond.

327,GME," I look it differently. I believe in the tech narrative that somehow Cohen will turn GME into a tech company. As a result, GME will require a tech valuation. As an example, at $1500 per share, GME is a 100B tech market cap. Keyword: tech. So those 800c can be valuable; timing it, not so much. That's why spreading your bets through various expirations do mitigate timing risk. Ideally, if you're a believer in this tech valuation, leaps might be the best play

You are looking for a traditional setup of a Gamma Squeeze in an ideal scenario.

347,GME," On the flip side, if one owns the shares, one can make a profit by selling At-The-Money calls. ATM calls command the highest premium and pay out well when the stock trades sideways.

I sold $140 calls for $6.00 at 1:45pm and $4.76 at 2:09pm on Friday. That's a 4.3% and 3.4% return on calls with 2 hours to expire. This was just a fraction of my GME shares in case it mooned.

Market Makers buy calls because their job is to provide a market for stocks/options while they collect a premium. I assume MM algorithms automatically price and purchase your options based on volatility and calculated Delta/Gamma.

However, Short Sellers do not want it above $140 as that could trigger the price to go higher and higher. SS want those $140 options to expire worthless to prevent any gamma squeeze.

So now there appears to be 2 opposing forces (outside of retail):

1) MM that buy GME as Delta/Gamma increase and Out-The-Money calls become In-The-Money calls

2) SS that sell GME to lower Delta/Gamma to prevent a squeeze

Here's the fun part: Retail hodlers, with the profits from selling ATM calls, can theoretically use those profits to buy and hodl more GME.

So if the stock price is at $135, don‚Äôt buy the call options at $135 because you might be subject to some Friday afternoon price fuckery that makes your options out of the money and worthless by the next day.

383,CC, People understand the post just fine. It's just OP has setup some ideal scenario for a gamma squeeze in his head that doesn't reflect reality. The reason there are just fuck off large amounts of contracts every 50 dollars is precisely because this stock require very little catalyst to move. He says it has been flat but in what like a week and a half it found a new floor at 100 consolidated there and then returned 40 percent in a week. If we can see another week like that for movement (which is mostly based on HF and whales on our side of the trade) we will see a fuck ton of buying to cover at these old .001 percent delta  options that were safe to sell naked. Some might be CC but the further we go out of the money the more likely we start hitting full on naked calls that will need to cover. A jump to anything above 200 next week should  cause a fair amount of panic buying moving the price higher. And given the sheer number of contracts every 50 dollars the buying to cover volume could be fucking insane. As we approach and 800 strike shit will just get out of hand.,DeepSeaProctologist,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lyu9n0/options_greeks_and_why_gme_far_otm_calls_are/gpylw5i/,0.095,0.807,0.098,-0.3484

There definitely were other stocks in green as well though, notably PLTR for a few days, RKT which ppl either love or hate, and some other randoms. This isn't including penny stocks. Sure it's a bloodbath out there, but holding stocks is what's helping gme stay the course.

Obv holding is just one factor. The market is huge and will not be dissuaded by one stock as ""small"" as gme. I don't think it's a conspiracy as much as a misunderstanding of trade and economics.

I think it is reasonable to assume that whales know what an opportunity they have in GME, but also don't want to destroy the place where they make money (the goddamn world economy). If WE assume that THEY assume that they can make as much money as the government is willing to bail out their competitors for, then it is also reasonable to set that limit based on similar circumstances. 

The 2008 bailout was $750B. We know there are only 50m REAL shares. $750B√∑50m=$15k/share. If whales take their profit at that level and millions of shares sell (some of them likely 2-4 times), the price tanks and the squeeze be squozed. Maybe they'll wait until it's 5x that amount. The fed has been printing trillions to combat Covid, after all. What's another ~$4T?

The hedge funds who have short positions have absolutely no issue with the price going up. Hell, they‚Äôll egg it along, which is what we‚Äôre seeing happen right now. They just use the options market to convert their position from short to long, drive the price up, short the top and sell their longs. And they‚Äôll keep doing that all day.

If you‚Äôre one of the suckers thinking it‚Äôs magically gonna go to 10k, you‚Äôll end up being what‚Äôs called a bag holder. SI% doesn‚Äôt tell us enough information to make any conclusions, because it doesn‚Äôt tell us what those short positions are sitting at. If there‚Äôs 60% SI (which seems to be the general estimate) at 450, than the hedge funds are feeling 0 pressure and there will be no squeezing them. And given how easy it is to turn a short position into a long one....

485,GME," This is also from an article I just found. I will gladly link it if you wish. But this is kinda more information backing up the Twitter post and explaining why short interest% can be wrong- especially if these HFs are shorting ETFs with GME- it technically produces a synthetic long position- read the following it is copy/pasted


What's Going On In Exhibit 3?

Event #1: 100 ETF shares are created by an Authorised Participant and sold to Investor A.
At this point, there are 100 shares long and 100 shares outstanding.
Event #2: Hedge Fund 1 wants to short the ETF (perhaps they want to hedge an existing long position), so they borrow the ETF from Investor A and sell it to Investor B.
Now there are 200 shares long, 100 shares short, and 100 shares outstanding.
Note that any long holder (such as Investor B) can lend his stock whenever he pleases ‚Äì he has no idea whether or not the shares he received are borrowed or not.
Event #3: Hedge Fund 2 wants to short the ETF also (maybe as part of a pairs trading strategy); they borrow the ETF from Investor B and sell it to Investor C.
Now there are 300 shares long, 200 shares short, and still 100 shares outstanding.
Therefore, each short sale of shares leads to an additional long and short position, settled using the original long position, which is on loan. This increases open long and short exposures, but does not increase the number of shares outstanding.

*edit- this is not a GME post I copied from, this is literally just general information about shorted ETFs completely unrelated to GME

1. Sophisticated investors (people with years of expedience, teams of analysts, professional traders, and access to things like dark pools) found an excellent short they believed was fool proof- a retail stock largely exposed to dying malls in an indefinite pandemic that was already on death‚Äôs doorstep.

2. The company sold bonds because it was running out of cash. You neglected to mention the stock was dropping because sales were cratering and retail comps were shit. This showed the smart money, yes they‚Äôre smarter than most (read not all) people on here because they understand how capital markets work, who the counter parties are, and they do basic DD that they bounce off a room filled with other knowledgeable people.

3. They got overzealous and took out an outsized short position with brokerage firms failing, it appears, to ensure shares loaned weren‚Äôt already short.

4. u/DeepFuckingValue a CFA recipient (3 test exam with a 10% total pass rate combined covering sophisticated concepts like commodities, derivatives, gaap and IFRS accounting, bond/equity valuation & capital markets) who is also a sophisticated investor saw a hole in the buy-side consensus and, per the stipulations market efficiency, he acted upon it. Eventually he realized the short interest was high, thus uncovering a massive hole in their risk management.

5. Other sophisticated participants got in and surged the stock WELL past objective fair value. Suddenly hedge funds were running for the hills and the brokerages that did shit risk management and allowed the naked shorting (allegedly) by negligence had to cover their own asses. Immediately they disabled leveraged, with Robinhood and IBKR going the farthest by banning the trading.

6. Dumb money, now feeling emboldened by arrogance, decided they can set limit orders (those aren‚Äôt what feed the bid or the ask) and get whatever price they want. They decided the market is a casino (we say it here ingest due to the risk of options, but not literally) and that an infinity squeeze is rational (it‚Äôs not).

7. Some GENIUS APES deflected ALL of the senate heat by pivoting to a story about a protest against Wall Street, immediately putting a large swath of lawmakers on our side and *ahem* controlled the narrative *guh!*

8. Suddenly a large pile of activists bought into the stock, believing it was a true protest, or thinking they would be a part of the wealth transfer, and ended up holding monster bags.

No. Is it aggressive and questionable? Sure, but I give him props for actually doing DD and not spewing shit like OP.

10. Hedge funds and, I‚Äôm sure, many retail investors short the stock to enjoy the ride back down with the mean reversion. This increased the short interest, but not as much. Weeks went buy with manic conspiracy theories about hiding in ETFs etc, but nothing

11. News comes out that implied MAYBE some motion and once again, short squeeze triggered.

Short interest has dropped dramatically and was only 16 million shares February 12, down from 21M on January 29, and 62M on January 15. This data is consistent with Melvin covering their shorts in January and indicates that ‚Äòonly‚Äô 36% of the float is currently shorted (down from 136% in January). 

In addition, shares on loan has dropped about 17% and the cost to borrow has also gone down with 18% over the last week.

874,AMC," Let me preface and say this is speculation and for the purpose of discussion. This is my conjecture and I'm sure if I took the time study, there are SEC filings and other data that would either strengthen my speculation or show why it's wrong. This is more of common-sense flow of thought.

**Short interest isn't everything.**

It is likely short interest on AMC increased because the stock reached a high of 20.36 and was shorted on the way down. AMC diluted their stock further by issuing 44M shares to stay afloat until they can get up and running again. So if I understand correctly, they basically raised capital to make up for debt but this should only devalue cost per share.

If I were shorting a stock, it would be great news to know that some 44M shares were increased to the float, there is overall low institutional ownership, and the value of stock itself *should naturally decrease* due to increased supply to the float.

**They aren't close to profitable right now.**

They have a long way to go to turn back to any sort of profits after being shut down for a year and their margins aren't necessarily the greatest with the kind of business they are. I'd imagine there is some serious overhead on movie theaters.

**Costs:**  
Brick and mortar locations.  
Employees.  
Movie licensing.  
Concessions (which are always highly marked up at least, but the underlying also has to do with being able to order in bulk to save money. If they open at 25% capacity, these products won't be consumed at the same rate they were before and depending on shelf-life, the margin decreases if they can't reasonably order as much at a time and expect to go through inventory. The popcorn they'll be serving when they open back up? Probably the same popcorn that's been sitting in dry storage for 2 years now or they have to toss it out entirely and load up fresh.)

Other factors that play against this business? Streaming. Slowed or halted production of new movies. Rising costs of gas prices which affect cost of service of distributors to deliver goods for resale. Threat of inflation which also affects cost of goods. Requiring customer volume and turn over in order maximize revenues.

**Why does this stuff matter when obviously the event of gamma or short squeezing creates and event that certainly doesn't represent a ""fair value"" for stock anyway?**

I don't see sufficient catalysts to apply pressure great enough to make any shorts feel in danger. They're likely making a killing off the volatility because of how large the float is. They can probably make up all fees associated with shorting just by high-volume trading and scalping. I also don't see any reason why whales would take up this ""cause"" or think that the stock is undervalued in any capacity for going long and increasing ownership. There a massive float to expect retail interests to somehow lock up.

With such a half-ass'd evaluation and not digging through extensive documents and reading charts, it seems pretty plain to me personally that this is just a meme cause in the cross-fire.",Basting_Rootwalla,4,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lyxkze/gme_relationship_to_amc/gpyein8/,0.062,0.827,0.111,0.9719

Aren't going away any time soon???

You're right.

They've been *going away for a decade*. I'm not taking any chances on this whatsoever.

Number of films produced per year remains the same for the last 20 years.

Box office reports a trend of higher profits per year for the last 20 years, though lower if adjusted for inflation.

Ticket sales? Decline. They've dropped 20% over 20 years. But what's quite interesting is that the number of movie screens in the US has... GONE UP.

So they're building more screens and *still* selling less tickets.

This is just nationwide, freely available data.

Money to be made?

What the fuck are you talking about. That's already been priced in. Everybody already knows the economy is going to recover post covid. Everybody knew back in March. The markets already stabilised from it. There isn't going to be a huge explosion in AMC because covid is over.

You're absolutely in total denial and it is dangerous.

AMC took out a $400m loan and diluted shares for $500m+ to avoid ""imminent bankruptcy"". That isn't ""we have 900m to spend, let's go wild!"" That's: ""we are literally about to go under, what can we do to keep our jobs for another couple years?""

Should probably play around with far OTM cheap option calls to get a feel for theta.. I think theta is the most important reason options are difficult to understand. Calls and puts seem like a standard bet you would place with a bookie as we can all understand those basics. If 'X+Y' happens where X+Y aren't current = win. Add theta or 'time value' element to the equation and you can get a bet that deteriorates in value QUICKLY even if you're not really losing. I have calls that I bought OTM (out of the money) and far dated. They are now ITM by a few % but still far enough out they aren't worth much more than when I bought. Inversely as you approach that deadline date, time affects deep and quick as I have calls that are close date OTM and they drop 90% in value disproportionately. 

Thennnn consider that there is a volatility factor that makes even wildly OTM options worth more if the volatility is high enough. I bought short dated deep PUTs for RKT cuz fuck RKT prior to the huge launch, and though it went up in price thus making my bet ridiculous and unachievable, I profited selling the PUTs back because of volatility.",anon_78,9,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lz4onk/deep_gme_exposure/gq056vq/,0.075,0.841,0.084,-0.1431

Right, the question is what percentage of float is ""essentially unavailable up to X price""

The pressure is on the shorts as the floor keeps rising but it is totally still possible for them to cover at X price ( we don't know what this price is yet) because we do not know for sure what the actual short percentage of float is currently. 

This is where it gets interesting. There are the shares available to cover, this we know.

1) A non insignificant percentage of the float is held by a cult of HODLers. This group are currently unaffected by FUD. Many of them think they are going to get 100k per share (\*sigh\*)

2) A truly significant percentage of float is held by large institutional players that will only leave when their end of quarter profit taking target is in sight. The pullback in much of the market will make them just a tiny bit greedier. 

3) A still significant percentage of the float is controlled by mainstream investors that have seen the steady march upwards of the stock and the Media has started to lean into the Bull case on GME.

&#x200B;

So, now we get to the really interesting dynamics. Catalyst.

What upcoming news or occurrence can cause a quick upward pressure causing the cascading effect of ITM calls getting exercised and force a short squeeze followed be a higher sustainable price floor?

1) Gamestop themselves. A better than expected quarter combined with some guidance on strategy will help, a share recall ahead of the annual shareholders meeting, a stock split, a new CEO etc...

2) A large buy from a well known activist investor who shares the Ryan Cohen vision ( or is perceived to be compatible) and telegraphs their long hold.

3) A merger or acquisition with a high quality partner.

&#x200B;

And then the big question of price reaction is a tough read. What can your game theory tell us about that?

997,GME," Fuck, I really wish I knew. I have a rough idea based on how I evaluate businesses to buy and sell ( not a pro, just bought and sold a few but evaluated hundreds) 

My personal buy range got maxed out this week, while it is still in my range, it is close to the top of my buy range and the volume slowed down.  While I have continued to buy since mid January, I have one eye on squeeze gain potential and another eye on long terms hold for organic growth. 

If I were buying or selling a business, I would look at the Multiple for the sector and apply it to earnings as a starting point. Then I would add or subtract based on underlying conditions and longevity. As the pure brick and mortar retail play, I would offer a maximum of 3x earnings, Plus assets, less liabilities, less COVID discount, less average yearly value decay ( as we see retail losing market share to online sales) , so 3x 1.9B = 5.7BX .70 (  rough guess) for COVID for a starting offer of about 4 billion and then negotiate down based on value decay from market share bleed off. **That puts the bear case at around $50-$65 per share with a downward trajectory**

A more reasonable valuation would look at the turnaround efforts underway. It would also add some weight to the digital and web based revenue growth potential. Take all the same issues but add a new stream of revenue on an upward trajectory and assign an arbitrary number based on potential market share vs. strength of competitors. Here I would hope for Gamestop getting 25% of the market based on current Brand profile. I'm literally too lazy to do the math on this because the data is not right at my fingertips but let's just go with total value of Game industry in 2020 of 160B with 10% YOY growth. Assign an extremely optimistic 25% share of that market to GME and we have a 40B revenue with massive upside. Granted, cost to get there, fails and corrections, disruptive innovations etc... As this is a blue sky scenario, I would weight these changes as a small percentage of their future value. My guess is that we are really close to actual fair value right now. **Fair Value at around $160?** 

&#x200B;

**Bull case of $400 per share right now.**

There is a good analysis on GMEDD with some price targets but they are outdated due to the Massive Brand Awareness event for GME, before the Exile of the CFO, before the Double Down by DFV while pointing to the bleachers during a Congressional hearing.

1048,TSLA," I‚Äôm contemplating a legitimate inverse bet against you and your positions. What are the date/strikes on your puts? Willing to share? And how many contracts you have?

I won‚Äôt argue that ole 1 eye has the ability to pick his spots, but I would argue his exits aren‚Äôt always the best. He was short TSLA, but the whole ‚ÄúTesla at $100 won‚Äôt crash the market‚Äù is bullshit and I‚Äôll bet he started covering a huge chunk of those shorts yesterday. If he didn‚Äôt, he might regret it sooner than later. 

Your argument about share & option cost is invalid, in this range, many people/funds can actively afford it. Not to mention, the cult following is starting to make apple nerds look tame, try logging on Twitter. 

You also have legitimate hatred for shorts from Elon himself, and his ability/wildfire mentality to flip a switch is always regarding as a ticking time bomb. 

The truth is, I have been short Tesla, and years ago I spoke quite aggressively within my peer group about the real likelihood of Tesla going bankrupt and being bought up for pennies in receivership. It didn‚Äôt happen, and it won‚Äôt happen. 

The baseline of the company is strong, the branch-arms are gaining retard strength, and virtually everything that nutbar Musk says comes to fruition (his timelines are fucked, but so what).

Is the company overvalued, uh, yea. Is it going back to realistic valuations anytime soon, not a chance. Show me one valid comparison from a competing manufacturer that is actively taking meaningful market share from Tesla. 

It won‚Äôt be a monopoly, there will be opportunity (I‚Äôm balls deep in Lucid), but the previous mentality that big manufacturers like Ford/Gm/VW would squash Tesla like a roach is highly improbable at this point. 

Plenty of companies could‚Äôve caught Apple, Google, Amazon, etc...

1060,GIS," Tesla isn't the only company in the world in this space, but they have two things that their competitors don't have. First, they have the data that is needed to maintain a sizeable head-start in autonomous driving. They've been collecting data for a long time and in various locations, not fixed locations like cities/towns in California or Arizona (eg Waymo and Uber). Geospatial data is key and Tesla outpaces their closest competitors, it's not even close.

Second, Tesla has the name recognition in this space. It does not matter if it's a consumer in America or China, name recognition adds value, status, trust,and other intangible aspects for a consumer. This applies even if another product from a competitor might be cheaper and perhaps better. We've seen examples of this time and time again in various industries. Also, while Tesla started out with EV vehicles, consumers will naturally associate them with self driving cars due to applicable features in the EV products they have put out on the market.

This isn't even taking into consideration the deep and well-funded R&D Tesla does when it comes to implementing computer vision, deep learning, GIS, and other relevant fields for their self driving cars.",an0n05,7,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lyzcxu/the_tsla_bubble_has_finally_popped/gpz910j/,0.019,0.935,0.046,0.77

1075,FSD," Waymo is definitely ahead. Tesla will never have 100% safe FSD just based on how they're trying to implement it. That's why they're having so many issues. Tesla is trying to train their models only with real life data, training on every possible scenario. This won't work, there will always be untrained scenarios that may lead to accidents, similar to past accidents that forced Tesla to remove FSD beta from cars.

Waymo on the other hand is using advanced simulations to train their models and are using various hardware, such as LIDAR sensors for their cars. The simulations alone should theoretically be better at finding and training situations that are rare but, LIDAR is also a good backup to ensure no accidents happen if there is anything in front of the car that the network doesn't recognize.",throwaway821738281,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lyzcxu/the_tsla_bubble_has_finally_popped/gq0qhzh/,0.094,0.81,0.096,0.3393

1142,GME," > Market makers profit from providing liquidity to markets, *not* from taking directional positions. In practice, what this means is that market makers charge you a slight premium, and then position themselves so that no matter what happens, their premium is preserved. This positioning is called hedging. 

The only thing your link describes is market makers profiting from the spread between bids and asks - e.g. market makers buy a stock at $10 while selling it at $10.05. That's how they make profit through volume. The rest, which is the premise of your post, is not backed up by a source. You have a source for delta-neutrality, not for market makers robotically employing it.

> The last thing a market maker would ever want to do is take a bullish position on the meme stocks that they are selling you options on. So how do market makers actually hedge? 

By buying shares fueling the bull run, selling more calls, and in turn buying even more shares to hedge their recently sold calls. Curious how the last thing a market maker would ever want to do is take a bullish position on a meme stock they are selling calls on when this is exactly what a gamma squeeze is being portrayed as.

>Ok, now we're ready to understand how market makers hedge. Market makers employ [delta-neutral](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deltaneutral.asp) strategies. This means that their overall position will have a delta of zero with respect to the stock price (a stock always has a delta of 1 with respect to itself of course). So how do they do this?  
>  
>They do this by selling you a call option, and then buying just enough shares to maintain a delta-neutral position. They then constantly adjust their position, buying or selling more shares as the delta of the option increases or decreases. They can do this because they are large institutions who can trade quickly with little cost.

I.e. not only do they fuel a bull run but as they sell even more calls they need to keep hedging, creating a feedback loop. What do market makers do with all the meme stock shares they've purchased to hedge their losing call sales? Hold them like the professed apes in this sub, waiting to be taken to the cleaners when the bubble pops?

> (1) The market maker wasn't forced to buy 100 shares of GME, like I've seen many users on here claim. Instead, they will only buy 50 shares. 

Out of curiosity, where do market makers get all the underlying options shares from?

> Let's continue with the example above, and assume that GME has gone up $2 and now trades at $139. According to the greeks in the table above, the new delta of the option will be approximately *0.498 + 2 x 0.0077 = 0.5134.* Remember that there are 100 options in a contract, so the delta of the contract is now *51.34*. If the market maker maintains their initial position of 50 GME shares, they will end up with a delta of *-1.34* with respect to GME. To avoid this, they need to purchase 1.34 shares of GME.  
>  
>Market makers will thus constantly adjust the number of shares they are holding in order to maintain delta-neutral positions. They incur some cost doing this, because the more volatile the stock is, the less quickly and efficiently the market makers can hedge. But they still make money overall, because they've charged you a premium for the option that takes this into account. This is why they charge you a higher premium for volatile stocks.

The premium they charge you only serves to reduce their nominal losses if the stock is out of control, in part fueled by their own activity. The market makers are profiting from their meme shares, not their sold calls. At what point do market makers realize that a monstrous imbalance is being created as the astronomically inflated value of their meme shares runs out of buyers? They just got owned at their own volume game. Is this really how stupid market makers are?

1143,GME," \> but i can't stop thinking that options can't possibly be a +EV game for us

Buying options (in general) has a negative expected value, yes. Now what does this mean? This means that if you stick a bunch of random options contracts on your wall with post-it notes, and then throw darts at them and buy and hold whatever contract your darts hit, you will lose all of your money over time.

This is in contrast to buying stocks. If you repeat the same procedure with stocks from the S&P 500, believe it or not, you will make a positive return over time.

So:

\> 1- in which scenarios is buying options +EV for us?

This is unanswerable. You have to make your own judgement about the probabilities, returns, and risk involved in any given option contract.

\> 2 - do you think the gme squeeze be replicated onto other squeezable stocks, or is this a special case and why?

I don‚Äôt have the same amount of capital as some of the people here on WSB, but I try to invest what I can afford and nothing I can‚Äôt, which makes it hard to look at +1200 on the screen and not sell and then throw it back in at a dip.

I held because I value the stock to be worth at least triple my cost per share. If not for the short term, considerably for the long term after the country reopens.

1210,UNFI," I used to work with UNFI. Out of the business now but worked with them long enough to have some insight.

UNFI up until around 2016 was reliable as hell and great to work with. They didn't always have the cheapest prices, but were always in the ballpark. There weren't too many of those products that you look at the price compared to other vendors and say 'holy shit where did they get that price from', like you do with KEHE.

Around 2016 they started restructuring their operations. Started getting creative with rearranging warehouses, and did the SuperValue acquisition. Their service went to shit, and I started working to strengthen relationships with other vendors so we could be ready to bail on UNFI if needed.

From my experience, a lot of the time when a company starts getting messy like this it's because they're collapsing. Sometimes when a company goes through something like this it's because somebody has a vision, knows that implementing it is going to be messy as hell, but knows the other side is going to pay off.

And they can't take that away 
 
 
 
And I'm proud to be an Autist
 
'Cause at least I know I'm free

Who sold their GME
 
And I'd gladly stand up next to you
 
And invest with no regrets
 
'Cause there ain't no doubt
 
I love this board
 
Mods Bless the Wall Street Bets
 
 
 
From the floor in New York City
 
To accounts on Fidelity  
 
From the house of your wife‚Äôs boyfriend
 
You‚Äôve tried to make him see
 
From u/DeepFuckingValue
 
And your own portfolio 
 
Where there‚Äôs tendies in every Autist‚Äôs gut
 
And it's time we buy and hold
 
 
 
And I'm proud to be an Autist
 
‚ÄòCause at least I know I'm free
 
And I won't forget the paper hands
 
Who sold their GME
 
And I'd gladly stand up next to you

Tesla's ""AI"" will only be ""intelligent"" when doing one single thing - driving cars. Arguably, they will most likely have a big team of people who are really skilled at developing neural networks, which could give them an edge when taking on other similar endeavours, but the ""AI""'s of today are by no means plug-and-play.  


The same goes for other companies.  


You don't see DeepMind putting their AlphaGo NN into cars. You won't see Tesla putting their FSD NN into day trading bots. You won't see *[insert AI company]* putting their *[insert software name]* into *[insert use case other than what the given AI company is currently focused on]*.

AI's of today require a massive amount of good data and a neural network designed to be good at one specific thing (or at least rather a narrow area of things).",vegoonthrowaway,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lz41z0/fsd_v83_has_literally_1000_improvements_are_you/gq05kad/,0.029,0.895,0.076,0.8316
