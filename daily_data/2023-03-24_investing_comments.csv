0,CD," Yes. I'm not going to put my money in a CD, even at 5% and then pay 35% federal tax, 11.3% state tax, and 3.8% net investment tax, for a total of 50.1% tax. That gives me an after-tax return of 2.5%.

I could pay down my mortgage for a better return. Only the first $750k of a mortgage is tax deductible. And my mortgage is higher than 2.5%. Sadly, much higher.",hfutrell,108,/r/investing/comments/120kkuq/do_fixedincome_assets_such_as_bonds_and_dividend/jdi3jyf/,0.077,0.847,0.077,0.25
1,NEA," Listen - your perspective on that is limited by assuming that retirement accounts are available to all high-income individuals.  As soon as you make > 228k as a couple, you can't even contribute to an IRA.

https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/amount-of-roth-ira-contributions-that-you-can-make-for-2023

If you were self-employed for whatever reason without a 401k option, or worked for a smaller company that didn't offer it, your options to take advantage of tax-shelters in the traditional sense dwindle quickly.

Or let's say that you do have a 401k, and your combined income is 400k - you could contribute 22,5k, match up to 27k total, and your partner could do the same.  That's only reducing MAGI by 45k, so you're down to 355k combined.  Can't make any IRA contribution, but you want to save even more money.  The only place for it to go is in a taxable account if you want to hold stocks or bonds.  

Let's say that you're 60 years old and you're making those numbers - super easy for two married doctors or lawyers.  You don't want to hold much in stocks because you're thinking to retire at 62, so maybe you're 80-20 bonds at this point.  You just have to eat those taxes, and that's exactly why you look for options like NEA https://www.nuveen.com/en-us/closed-end-funds/nea-nuveen-amt-free-quality-municipal-income-fund",Misaiato,-7,/r/investing/comments/120kkuq/do_fixedincome_assets_such_as_bonds_and_dividend/jdi766e/,0.007,0.889,0.105,0.9645
2,CRSP," >  Growth stocks typically outperform dividend stocks

not even remotely true. growth stocks have terrible long-term performance histories, and investors consistently over-pay for growth. 

dividend stocks outperform in every nation in the world, when we look at the long-term, mainly because they're more stable in bear markets. they win more by losing less. the data is overwhelming. 

the CRSP database at the U. of Chicago shows that dividend stocks performed better than the overall US market in the majority of 20 year periods between the 1920s and 2000s, and with lower volatility. https://www.heartlandadvisors.com/media/Insights/White-Papers/Dividends-A-Review-of-Historical-Returns.pdf

two studies show the higher dividend stocks in the S&P 500 have outperformed the broad S&P 500. one study by professor Jeremy Siegel of Wharton https://www.wisdomtree.eu/en-gb/-/media/eu-media-files/users/documents/1364/dividends-of-dividend-wte-final.pdf another by a team at Credit Suisse https://www.themoneysnowball.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/cash-is-king.pdf

a recent master's thesis shows the higher dividend Dow Jones Industrials stocks outperformed the Dow. https://scholarworks.unr.edu/bitstream/handle/11714/2408/Cai_unr_0139M_11688.pdf?sequence=1

another study shows investing internationally by higher dividend yield will give you superior results over time: https://www.kamny.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/The-Importance-of-Dividend-Yields-in-Country-Selection.pdf

Deutsche Bank has floundered for a few years now, consistently lying between around €8-13 per share, but has recently found the motivation for a turnaround, and whilst Credit Suisse was notorious for overstating and underperforming on their turnaround ambitions DBs were really starting to bear fruit.

13,CD,"  I find the stock/bond/crypto/derivatives and SEC all very frightening these days.  I don’t for a minute believe this is all business as usual and there are many more bad actors with powerful friends who benefit together… so much for my optimistic younger self. 

 So my few thoughts…  
""Pay yourself first"" was a motto I learned 40 years ago... I would use the VG money market fund(s)  as while making further decisions It’s is paying 4. 5 % today, paying interest monthly so it compounds. Keep funding your tax deferred option and consider a Roth portion.  
Continuing a saving/investing practice will be in your favor in the long run. It's okay to have a low risk tolerance right now. It still makes since to define a specific asset allocation and stick  
with it, increasing it when ready.  We started our early life a bit hippy-ish so when we got real jobs (1980s) we were determined to buy our lives back in 20 years, which we did.  Any income raise we add at least 50% of it to our savings rate. We also saved outside of retirement 5 buckets: his, mine, child, emergency, big ticket items. :)  
My mother raged on the corruption in the financial markets even in the 1970's but stayed  
100% in the stock market.  She invested almost all her life. She was confident that the controlling powers would ALWAYs take care of themselves  first and foremost. She was mostly right. On the other hand my very successful father after selling his solid state capacitor company traded in about 10 carefully chosen stocks reviewed annually, studying them the old fashion way on paper.... sadly once computer generated analysis and trading became  
dominant it didn't work out as well since he was not a computer user and broker Merrill Lynch which speaks for itself.   
I /we are are not like either of them but I have always like investing...something in my genes..   
No Load VG  Diversified but these days only 10%  in market. Currently happy to have finally  
built out a 5 year CD ladder again in our IRA's  about 10 in stocks and no bond  
funds with the interest rates bouncing around. Retired with just enough income to tread water and a solid next egg. Maybe we are way too conservative at about 10% in the market but we sleep at night.   
So YES! Keep saving that money and pay yourself first! Good luck!  PS:  I wish I had a Roth retirement portion.",porttutle,1,/r/investing/comments/120s0hv/is_this_really_the_greatest_time_to_invest/jdjhltf/,0.063,0.769,0.168,0.9935

If a bank fails, remember that anything you own is yours, including investments like T Bills, stocks, ETFs, etc.

3. Banking will likely tighten credit lending (not good in theory)
4. Bigger banks (and indexes) such as $JPM $BAC $XLF is what I’d stick to, you have value and safety.

43,PACW, I bought 600 shares of PACW and 1000 of KBE. I’m going to hold these long term and pray they recover in the coming years.,Puzzleheaded_You2601,5,/r/investing/comments/11zy5az/is_now_to_time_to_buy_loads_of_bank_shares/jdf15rg/,0.0,0.83,0.17,0.5423
44,CS," Do your research, if either of those runs into trouble your shares could be worth very little to nothing. As an example, when CS dumped i picked up 2500 shares at 1.89. My take was, its a 150+ year old bank, its not going anywhere and ill sit on it and take profits down the road. Then the swiss gov jumps in, forces a sale and i had to quickly dump the shares at .95. Almost 50% haircut in a few days. For us that little bit invested isnt anything in the larger picture but for you, being early on, the loss of those funds opportunity cost could be huge. Now if you have done your research and still think those are a good buy then great. But chances are you bought those on a whim just like i did.

I went through this during the dot com.  Lost -35% at least. I kept a few like MSFT, IBM, INTC and dumped funds similar to ARKK, Chewy.  MSFT took me 16 years of waiting to recover, INTC \~ 8 patient years. My IBM actually prospered and splitted.

57,BHP," All I invest in is commodities, so you know I'm of the opinion that 25% exposure is fine. But why the majors? Vale has a lot of torque just because of its region. Splitting the business will be interesting. Rio and BHP are largely redundant. One or the other would be just fine. Glencore is ridiculously cheap, and it also has a major trading arm to compete with Trafigura and the like.

If you're in mining for copper exposure, you're going to do much better with either a pure play like Ivanhoe, speculation on junior companies, or in the very appealing ETF COPX, which gives you exposure to Zijin and Vedanta in addition to some excellent western copper names.

65,TD," TD yes, that's what I use. But you can only buy mutual funds through the desktop website, not the TD app or ToS. 

Money market funds are based on various kinds of 'guaranteed' obligations, so the rate changes with the overall interest rate environment. If the rate stayed where it is now, yes, you'd get roughly that amount.
