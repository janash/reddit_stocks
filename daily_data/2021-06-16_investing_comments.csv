You obviously hate the ""meme"" stocks frenzy that seems to be going on, but you also call those companies out for not doing things they are, in fact, doing.

Right now I like some emerging market bonds and I have been into commodities and commodities related equities a lot the last months.

50,VERY," I am really shocked by today’s release. Powell’s rhetoric is VERY different than previous meetings and has me concerned. They appear to be taking the threat of inflation more seriously which contradicts a lot of their previous statements. Feel like I am getting gaslit by the Fed honestly. How, in a matter of months, can they completely change their tone? They know their aggressive policy would cause inflation but just didn’t care and now they are going to slowly begin walking back old comments and recognize the bigger issue at hand. The impact of what the Fed did in 2020 is going to be felt for years to come.

Might be too late Mr. Powell.",jejakqmqm,13,/r/investing/comments/o1bkt6/federal_reserve_now_expect_to_raise_rates_by_the/h202x8x/,0.07,0.821,0.109,0.7767

52,AI," **From a Canadian Financial Blog.........*****BUT*** **re: inflation fears and tech influence can apply to us all. Thoughts?**

""Meanwhile the deflationary influence of technology continues. Every month productivity goes up as more industries automate, reduce operating costs and replace dithering humans with flawless AI. Technology eats inflation. It allows production to be scaled-up to meet rising demand without increasing costs. This lets retailers trade bricks and HVAC overhead for a web site and a shipping agent, for example. Banks will close hundreds of branches. Government service counters will be kaput. One legacy of Covid and WFH has been to digitize the entire population, proving the economy can function when 25% of all workers stopped going to work.  
  
We live in the cloud now. So what if the next big thing is deflation?  
  
Get used to the idea. It’s the future. The cloud is a platform of innovation allowing programmers access to computing power that was a dream just a few years ago. As computing costs deflate, so do others. Manufacturing expenses and payrolls fall. Services become targeted and more cost-effective.  Robots never sleep or get sick or hungover or need time off or require pensions. Deflation is all around us now, masked by the bits of life that are high-profile, inflationary (and transient) like housing.""",SkoochLeaf,1,/r/investing/comments/o1bkt6/federal_reserve_now_expect_to_raise_rates_by_the/h20iwps/,0.051,0.901,0.047,0.1926
53,IMO," Same. First the Fed said they wouldn't raise rates until after 2023, now they are saying they will raise rates by .6% by the end of 2023. I believe they are just saying these things to instill confidence but it doesn't mean they are beholden to it.

56,UI," He knows inflation poses a serious threat, but he's trying to deflate the expectations balloon he's inflated about transitory inflation. 

If you look at pricing data, it's pretty clear inflation will continue to trend up through the year, perhaps persistently higher than the drop off from the base effect. For example, rents have risen at a fast pace, but only 1/6 housing stock is sampled per month, so it will show up in delayed fashion. Shortages of chips and other things will not be resolved this year. It wouldn't surprise me if we end the year with 6-7% CPI.

Retail sales volume is up 20% compared to 2019. That's an extremely large move, and quite unnatural and unprecedented. 

Unemployment numbers are clearly driven by supply rather than demand, and jobs will rapidly fill as UI benefits wear off, taking away their jobs excuse.

Unfortunately I think it's too late to deflate things slowly.

61,AGI," There are so many difference aspect of Google. But if I was going to really just focus on the biggest reason I am bullish on Google is because of AI/ML.  I am a firm believer AI/ML is the future.  ML - Machine Learning

Google leads in every layer of the AI stack. Lowest layer is silicon and their TPUs have been setting records with both training and inference at scale.

""Google's TPU Pods are Breaking Records — And We Aren't Surprised""

https://blog.bitvore.com/googles-tpu-pods-are-breaking-benchmark-records

Next layer up above the silicon is basically the AI operating system. The most popular today is TensorFlow which is from Google. The second most popular is Pytorch from Facebook.

TensorFlow now has over 150K stars on Github.

https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow

One of the most popular projects on Github.

The next layer above the framework is the algorithms. The best way to measure success with algorithms is the papers accepted at the canonical AI organization, NeurlIPS. In 2018, 2019, 2020 and sure will be the same in 2021 has seen Google having the most papers accepted by a large margin.


Next layer is data. Which is probably where people most think of Google and Facebook. But Google has the more valuable data.

Facebook data is what you want people to think of you. Versus Google has more truthful information. There is probably no more valuable data than search queries you make. It is this very unusual window into who you are. But with Google there is then all their other services.

YouTube has the video data. Google Maps the location data. Google Photos is the biggest repository of photos. The list goes on and on.

The next layer up is the applications. Search is the biggest AI/ML driven application in the world. Search penetrates 99% of the population of the US and then on top of that Google now has over 92% share.

https://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share

Why Google search share is increasing while competitors like Bing are declining is because of the Google superior AI. Google is now getting 2/3 of queries ending without needing a click. That is up from 50% the year before.

65,GOOGL," Solid post. Reading it made me go back and review the case for GOOGL.

I think what troubles me in reading their annual report and such is that it's all about the social causes they support, doing good for the world... Causes I can agree with, but it also feels like they're neglecting shareholder value. 

I found it interesting that in the Alphabet 2020 annual report, the word ""shareholder"" only appears 3 times, and ""return on capital"" only once (and not used in terms of financial returns). ""ROIC"" or ""return on investment"" are never used. As a company they seem to care about a lot of things, but not really their shareholders or financial results.

Google has a dominant hold on a lot of the web, but what happens next? Where's the future growth? The ""Other Bets"" is what I'd like to be excited about with them, but I have basically no idea what's going on there and a lot of their projects have been flops.

GOOGL strikes me as a very binary outcome stock: either ""Other Bets"" turns into some massive, unpredictable moonshot, or they fade out by resting on its laurels. I have no idea how to evaluate which is more likely so I don't want to invest with them.",PrefersDigg,3,/r/investing/comments/o0tr34/google_quietly_killing_it_in_2021_ytd_performance/h1xh9ol/,0.083,0.782,0.135,0.8981

72,TV," Honestly it is insane that a single company has over 90% of search.   Plus it is growing.

There is just nothing in our world anywhere near as powerful or as valuable.   Google is basically controlling the information flow.   

This provides Google tons and tons of runway to further monetize.  I think they barely even got started.  But that is just Search.

Then look at YouTube.  Only one site more popular in the world.  Which is Google search.

YouTube this year will exceed Netflix in revenue as it is already getting close but growing so much faster.

Google appears to also finally be pulling back on giving so much stuff away for free.  Take Google Photos.  Over a billion active users must have been a huge expense in free unlimited photo storage for everyone.  They have now switched that from an expense to a revenue stream with storage.

The next big one will be ending ad blocking on YouTube.  Google has the technology as there is no ad blocking possible with YouTube TV.     They have personalized ads but they just put them in the stream so the blocking does not work.   They will do the same with YouTube at some point.   I could see it being done gradually.

In the end it is all about the assets a company has.   Google has crazy valuable assets that they have yet to monetize.  That is just the ideal situation.",bartturner,5,/r/investing/comments/o0tr34/google_quietly_killing_it_in_2021_ytd_performance/h1ykhes/,0.066,0.768,0.166,0.9774

A ton of people (especially in the US) have Apple iPhones. Microsoft has long dominated the PC market, and not to mention their Office applications. It's literally impossible to run a large business without using Microsoft & their services.

Also I think Google isn't too popular with retail investors for a few reasons.

* In a lot of the areas Google dominates in they're dominating so much that the only way they can grow is if the market itself grows. Take web searching for example, it's nearly impossible for Google to grow their percentage share of that market at this point. I also don't think it's all that likely that Android phones take a meaningfully bigger share of the market anytime soon unless Apple screws up really bad with the next iPhone.

* Google's shares are too expensive for retail investors, especially compared to much more popular AAPL & MSFT stock. imho Google would really benefit from a stock split, even though in theory it shouldn't change the price at all.

* Google is one of the company's that's been getting a lot of heat from the US government of late. And unlike some other FAANG stocks like AAPL who are also facing the same issue Google doesn't have a base of deeply loyal users.

* Google just seems to lack a new market/product that screams ""this thing will bring in a ton of money"". All of their biggest successes like Google search, Youtube, gmail, Android, etc. were all made (or purchased) at least a decade ago. And despite well over a decade's worth of investment in it there still isn't much to show for their Waymo project in terms of Shareholder return.

Lastly I think they are accounting for certain deflationary trends AT HOME to continue.

A few of those deflationary trends include:

* Commodity bottlenecking of everything will be fixed and supply will meet or exceed demand.

* Pressure on produced goods via importing. There's a lot of China talk and the tariffs aren't likely going away. But even if there is already a host of ""new sweat shops"" lining up or being set up in SEAsia/India/Paki/Africa/LatAm. 

* Also heavy pressure at home to keep prices low via inner-US competition and fear of disruption. A good case of this at this moment would be in banking/finance where there are a lot of threats of disruption rising up. The traditional big banks probably feel not only the pressure from the low cost/fee services that internet banks like SoFi, Ally, CapitalOne, or others provide. But they will also feel pressured to improve their own services because those same companies are each trying to build their own top-to-bottom all-in-one financial super apps to replace the traditional big banks.

* Pressure on wages as companies use technology to disrupt the workforce. This can come from AI/digital automation and mechanical/industrial physical automation. But it will ALSO come from outsourcing of manufacturing as well as importing of goods from ""new sweat shops"" will mean downward pricing pressure on blue collar jobs/wages, and a slippery slope of offshoring of digitized white collar jobs during the ""work from home"" period.

That last one about offshoring white collar jobs is extremely worrisome even though it doesn't apply to myself. The ""tragedy of the commons"" happens because humans will exploit opportunities. Companies are runned by people and will inevitably be enticed or forced into this race to lower costs via outsourcing. In game theory, the choice becomes you as a company doing it first to minmax and get ahead OR you're forced to later when other either exploit the opportunity before you.

* Also heavy pressure at home to keep prices low via inner-US competition and fear of disruption. A good case of this at this moment would be in banking/finance where there are a lot of threats of disruption rising up. The traditional big banks probably feel not only the pressure from the low cost/fee services that internet banks like SoFi, Ally, CapitalOne, or others provide. But they will also feel pressured to improve their own services because those same companies are each trying to build their own top-to-bottom all-in-one financial super apps to replace the traditional big banks.

* Pressure on wages as companies use technology to disrupt the workforce. This can come from AI/digital automation and mechanical/industrial physical automation. But it will ALSO come from outsourcing of manufacturing as well as importing of goods from ""new sweat shops"" will mean downward pricing pressure on blue collar jobs/wages, and a slippery slope of offshoring of digitized white collar jobs during the ""work from home"" period.

That last one about offshoring white collar jobs is extremely worrisome even though it doesn't apply to myself. The ""tragedy of the commons"" happens because humans will exploit opportunities. Companies are runned by people and will inevitably be enticed or forced into this race to lower costs via outsourcing. In game theory, the choice becomes you as a company doing it first to minmax and get ahead OR you're forced to later when other either exploit the opportunity before you. Either way it leads to the same result just with different time frames and consequences.

One thing I will note is that transient inflation doesn't mean that CPUs/cars/soda/burgers will go back down in price. Most will stabilize and go back to normal inflationary trends, but others will not. It just means the rate of inflation will not be as constantly high as before and will stabilize. I also don't think all asset prices are going back down even if some things are. There can be corrections, but it is unlikely that there will be huge downward dips unless they were things clearly in bubbles that have already deflated precious metals, stay at home stocks, SPACs, digital currencies, lumber/copper, etcetc. Gold for example has and still will go up. It's just that gold heavily speculated and pumped into a bubble last summer, but if you look at the [100 year gold prices without adjusting for inflation then it's price has had an upward trajectory.](https://www.macrotrends.net/1333/historical-gold-prices-100-year-chart)",zxc123zxc123,3,/r/investing/comments/o13vcs/understanding_transient_inflation/h1znucd/,0.103,0.805,0.092,-0.3295
95,GDP," I disagree with your assessment of the root cause. It's not money supply that is the cause of inflation, it's just that at this time last year we were all locked down and COULDN'T spend money. Now all the dollars that weren't spent last year are all in pursuit of items of the same goods.

WSJ reported the money supply increased 26% in the year between Feb 2020 and 2021, we are seeing 5% inflation now. Which, since we didn't have much inflation at all last year, is basically making up for the last year.

Yes, there are some outliers (as you said, timber, used autos) and other things that aren't in CPI (gasoline, which again is spiking because last year no one could drive, so there was no demand and it fell to artificial lows - this year we can drive, so there is demand)

Point being, so far it feels like inflation is going to be the main story this year, because we're coming off a year with depressed spending. Once spending normalizes, it will probably settle down (hence transitory). If it was due to monetary supply issues, we'll see it continuing to march up 5% (or more) per year in subsequent years, and what were seeing now would just be the tip of the iceberg. Probably too soon to tell, but so far it just seems like the fall in GDP has been reversed, and prices are all rebounding off of artificial lows.",lowlyinvestor,1,/r/investing/comments/o13vcs/understanding_transient_inflation/h1zq0gu/,0.048,0.919,0.033,-0.1531
96,DD," I saw some really good DD on the lumber industry, showing that it wasn't caused by any supply chain issues, but actually it was just the retail businesses increasing their prices and profiting off of the increased demand for renovations, etc. Probably to make up for the isolation period during Covid.
This theory is further supported by the tables that show an increase in sales, but no increase or little increase in cost of goods sold.
Therefore the price increase was not drivin by a decrease in supply.

103,DD, Ok so looking into this stock as I'm learning how to do good DD. So it looks like a prefered holder coverted there shares to common stock. I am assuming this was done because they no longer feel the need to keep the prefered status (I beleive they are able to be first in line for asset liquidation if the company goes belly up with prefered stock) and has decided the profit gain from common stock outweighs the security of prefered stock. Please correct me if I'm wrong here. I also see that the company offered 29mil shares of common stock. This is where I'm confused. Did the company take whatever they had for regulated (company held shares) and open them to the public to gain quick cash. They say its going to new acquisitions and expansion etc... but did the opening of these 29mil shares cause the sudden decrease in share value? And woukd it be safe to assume the share value will go back up in long term as long as the company does well?

107,CLNE," Ironically 10k is almost exactly what I have to invest, so I'm going to follow the above bullet points. I moved my old employer 401k to a Rollover IRA through fidelity. I threw it all in a couple stocks |100 CLNE@11.93200 | 200 UWMC@10.18  | 25 VUG@276.82

My goal for this account for the next year is to take 10k out next year to help with a down payment of my first house, I'm aware of the income tax being taken out but I'm only at the 12% bracket. I'm 38 with a wife and a 3 year old daughter in the US. Household income is around 70k.

My question really is what to do with the bulk of this, am I safe with my current setup? I know the 3k in meme stocks, CLNE and UWMC(although they have some good fundamentals. I think?) is a little risky, but I'm okay with that small portion being risked. The 7k in VUG seemed like a good idea, but I'm not sure if I should diversify that a bit? I do have Options enabled and was considering selling covered calls on my current meme stocks and others as well. Ultimately, my end goal with this account is retirement after taking the 10k for a house. I'd like to build it up as much as possible before that so I have a bigger nest to work with after the 10k is removed.",JonZ82,1,/r/investing/comments/o10gcj/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/h20jj3q/,0.028,0.866,0.107,0.9632

Its complicated ; some assets prices may stabilize , some may fall depending how aggressively they raise rates. Newly issued bonds , savings account will offer higher rates

Stocks are a bit more complicated ; obviously if the FED raised rates by a HUGE amount stocks would fall however they are very very unlikely to do that. I would guess the FED in maybe 6-12 months will slowly start raising rates maybe 0.15% per quarter , thats not a lot and it will be a slow ramp up, its hard to say how it will effect stocks as it will be a long slow process is my guess , other factors will be at play too",SirGlass,2,/r/investing/comments/o10gcj/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/h1zn3e0/,0.086,0.837,0.077,-0.2885

176,CVS," CVS and Walgreens do dominate the pharmacy space, but I think the issue I have is that people are going elsewhere for meds in some cases (Costco cheaper for a lot of things, for example - https://www.reuters.com/article/us-drugs-costs/prescription-drugs-cost-least-at-costco-and-most-at-cvs-study-idUSBRE92R13820130328, https://www.quora.com/Why-are-pharmaceutical-drugs-so-cheap-at-Costco-Pharmacy-compared-to-other-drugstores-Whats-the-catch-Are-they-selling-the-same-drugs, etc) and if you ever look around a CVS store, you're paying a convenience premium for pretty much everything there. I really treat both stores as ""only if I have to go there for something"" because really, any sort of basic staple-y items that I could want are cheaper elsewhere - pretty much anywhere else in most cases. 

When I was a kid, there wasn't a ton of options. If you needed something quick, you went to the local Walgreens and you paid that premium because there really weren't tons of other very convenient options. When I was a kid there wasn't going online to order something or going online at all. Now if you need something you can have Target bring it to you in a couple of hours, or you can have Prime delivery tomorrow or in some cases the same day. There are tons of other options, but Walgreens and CVS are still charging for everything in the store like there aren't.

People thought that vaccinations were going to provide a huge boost to CVS/Walgreens but they really haven't.

By early May, CVS:

""Ricky, this is. Eva. I’ll take that one. Overall, as you said, recently we have seen some vaccine hesitancy. We’ve seen a drop off of around 30% as you look at some of the recent data there. The initial outlook we had provided was, it was about a 2% to 3% contributor to our overall volume growth rate. Now, we’re probably trending at the lower end of that range given performance to date and what we’re seeing in the market. In our outlook, we are assuming the pediatric vaccine. But what’s not included in our current estimates is the impact of a booster, should there be one later this year or…"" (https://news.alphastreet.com/cvs-health-corporation-cvs-q1-2021-earnings-call-transcript/)

And the flu season wasn't there.

It's probably a year where value continues to work and CVS will probably get lifted by that. And there's certainly other aspects to CVS than the stores but I can't get over the idea that I'm just not that fond of the stores. And maybe I'm wrong (I hope for you that it does well and nothing against CVS really), but over the last half decade CVS is down 10% - something's not been working.

If you're a trader and 1% declines in things are causing that much concern, don't trade or have stronger information/research behind your decisions. If you're investing and posting every time something is down slightly then you're going to cause yourself too much stress. People have to have the confidence in what they invest in to the degree that a 5-10% drop is not a ""OMG WHATS GOING ON?"" 

I think - and perhaps it's more people new to investing - a lot of people on here also seem to think that every headline is something to react to when that's just not the case. There has to be some filter built up over time to be able to judge what news is and what is not worth reacting to - and a lot isn't imo.

It seems IMO like there's a fair amount of stressing in this sub lately (people asking ""is the stock market still recovering?"" - https://old.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/o0ngnp/is_the_stock_market_still_recovering_rn/ - as if we've gone through a market crash or something when the market is actually at all time highs) and the goal really is - if the market is really causing someone stress/concern, there's something amatter and lets try to figure it out. There's a lot of ""my portfolio is deep red!"" in the daily threads lately, too.

""To say it's not possible to beat the market is just untrue.""

Status of and extent of loan modifications  
Historical realized loan losses.

210,CAN," Investing is arguably hard. There's nothing easy about it. Do you follow the advice of tens of millions of retail traders and investors, and invest into the S&P 500, or do you follow the advice of another subset of tens of millions of retail traders and investors, and have a model of choosing individual stocks? Then you get into the question after 30 years whether or not you made the right investing choices. It's completely okay to not know what you're doing, and to have confidence, and to have doubt.

To answer your question, I'll be using some data you can find online. Firstly, if there's anything that CAN be proven, is the after-the-facts. The S&P 500 has returned 7-9% on average per year over the past couple of decades. This is only true because it happened. This will not mean it will continue gaining 7-9% on average annually for the next couple of decades. Second, an investment model is completely subjective, and you need to know and willingly accept the risks that each methodologies provide. With statistics, ""Every model is wrong, but some are more useful"" - George Box. Every model can be proven wrong in some compacity, but these models can provide a basis of probability. For example, there will be instances where certain individuals and parties will outperform the S&P500, such as the Nasdaq, that returned 8-11% on average. However, investing into the S&P 500 may outperform most other methodologies, and that is quite useful.

These experts that you mention, what kind of experts are they? Are they retail investors that think they've found some magic formula? Are they social media influencers that need to make an income from giving their opinions? Are they licensed financial professionals? Every single person in this list may very well be wrong. The reason they are certain in their model is because humans crave certainty. The feeling of confidence in an event due to a certain causation or theory. However, certainty is not possible in the financial markets because returns are driven by thousands of events and that cannot be consistently forecasted. Ben Felix, a portfolio manager at from a Canadian wealth management firm has made a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTJtmaMjWWg) explaining more on this topic of following market experts. He is an advocate for index investing, so his own investing opinions fall on the S&P 500 side of the spectrum.

Choosing individual stocks for a portfolio is an extremely difficult task. Ben Felix has made another [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AecvTErBQY8) on picking individual stocks, and [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6HrepdLSu4) cover's the performance of top fund managers. One of the sources he uses is directly from S&P Global, found [here](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/spiva/article/us-persistence-scorecard/).

Knowing all of this, it is safe to say that investing into the S&P 500 is *probably* your best bet. You should also understand the risk you have on in your individual stocks. It is possible, in rare occasions, as Ben Felix has shown, that some fund managers may beat the S&P 500 in the **short term,** although not a huge percentage, but usually fails to beat it in the long term.

Another big topic in the financial investment world is the Modern Portfolio Theory. It is how one allocates certain asset classes in their portfolio to have diversity and such. Diversification is possible in many ways. You can have a portion in the S&P 500, and then some in an international fund, and other asset classes. However, like most other models, it lacks the the ability to beat the index consistently. Rotating your models and methodologies every time your current models become less efficient is a tough task to do frequently in the long term.

>I still know nothing really about what to look for as a 'good investment' so for medium-long term holds is just seeing a general uptrend for the all-time graph good enough?

This statement of yours is flawed at face value. A general uptrend for the all-time graph looks attractive, but who's to say it will continue up trending in the long term? A company's stock may not reflect the company's financials. A profitable company may not mean the stock is appreciating. There are many different factors that go hand in hand to move the price of the stock.

>Also if I would to be investing in quite a few stocks I don't want to have to spend too much time 'down in the weeds' studying minutiae as this isn't to be my main job so just want it to not take up too much time.

If you do not want to take up too much time, index investing is completely passive. You can add some flavor by then allocating capital into other funds, for better or for worse. Being 'down in the weeds' is completely normal. In some circumstances, it has taken weeks, months, or even years to recover. This doesn't also only apply to stocks, this can apply to global indexes. Most people trade on the U.S stock market, even many international traders. This is because the U.S Stock Market has yet to show long term weakness. For example, the European Stock Market has not reached a new high since April of 2000. It has come close in two occasions, one in 2007 and the current levels sit just under 2007 levels.

In the end, although many things point towards index investing as the right thing to do, many other things do work from time to time. If you absolutely need to be able to choose your own stocks, there's nothing wrong with it as long as you know the risks. You have all the right to choose what you invest in. It is your money. Every investment has their risks. If you absolutely have no idea what to do, or you're too scared of the consequences of choosing your own stocks, then passively invest into the index. If not, you have free rein over your own actions.

Good luck!",blanktoshi,6,/r/investing/comments/o11vtm/is_investing_in_a_range_of_individual_stocks/h1ymra7/,0.061,0.822,0.117,0.9967
211,IMO," IMO, I think you have to have a considerable ""why"" behind your choices, it can't just be ""what has good looking charts"" - if you haven't done any homework beyond ""the chart looks good"", if the stock runs into some turbulence, then how are you going to know whether to buy more or dump? Look at something like A2 (ACOPF), which had a fantastic chart from 2015 to 2020 and then since last Summer has proceeded to lose 70% pretty much in a straight line. 

A well-defined thesis and homework is the compass that can give you some sense of direction over the course of holding an investment.

212,RE," Free bump for you my friend, I am not expert but have owned REITs and rental properties. I just sold off my REITs due to some short term opportunities I wanted to invest in, but they were a very satisfying investment vehicle when researched properly. You have to carefully analyze each REITs exposure to market segments and decide if it's right for you. There is room for appreciation and income which is what makes them so attractive to investors.

Regarding actual real estate I was pretty small time just a few rental houses, the real money is in multi-family and commercial, I never looked into agricultural. Obviously only invest in real estate in markets you understand i.e. cities you are familiar with in your own country if you are going to be buying actual property. 

&#x200B;

Barriers to entry are significant. You will want to get a real estate license to minimize your losses on the front and back end of transactions. Dealing with the banks and lawyers is such a hassle, if you can manage to do it cash it's a lot easier but most people can't get started with cash reserves.

&#x200B;

Finally, regarding your hands off comment....I would steer clear of actual RE investing as it is more hands on than you can imagine and everyone in the business wants a piece of your pie and will expect to be compensated for their time in helping you manage properties and track down rent payment and fix damanges.

&#x200B;

20 years ago residential real estate was a fantastic tax shelter and you could expect to at least break even on rent if not produce income all the while appreciating properties and sheltering your income. Now the median home price relative to the median salary has increased significantly, and the tax laws no longer make this such a good deal.

243,XOM," I disagree.  Ultimately you’re investing your money into something, whether it’s an individual stock or ETF should be irrelevant.  My point is with energy stocks, especially ones tied to oil, it’s going to be tough to pick clear winners since growth opportunities aren’t all that evident.  I think you’re better off putting that money into an energy ETF and riding out the average.  Comparing VDE to XOM over the last couple years, VDE just barely edges it, which isn’t surprising since XOM is its largest position, but it still did better because it holds other energy stocks which did better.  If you understand that segment than it makes sense to invest in those individual stocks you think will break out or be consistent dividend payers.

They actually booked a one-time $1 billion profit directly related to the crisis. They were able to move a lot of gas from out of the state and sell it at the Texas hubs that had prices soaring.

You really have to stop looking at the stock market as the ""stock market"".

So if it's not the stock market, then what is it?

It's simple - its a representation of +100 years of human technological development, productivity, and societal advancement.

To say that you don't think it will continue, is to say that humankind will not continue to advance as a species.

>Today the world’s gold stock is about 170,000 metric tons. If all of this gold were melded together, it would form a cube of about 68 feet per side. (Picture it fitting comfortably within a baseball infield.) At $1,750 per ounce – gold’s price as I write this – its value would be $9.6 trillion. Call this cube pile A.

>Let’s now create a pile B costing an equal amount. For that, we could buy all U.S. cropland (400 million acres with output of about $200 billion annually), plus 16 Exxon Mobils (the world’s most profitable company, one earning more than $40 billion annually). After these purchases, we would have about $1 trillion left over for walking-around money (no sense feeling strapped after this buying binge). Can you imagine an investor with $9.6 trillion selecting pile A over pile B?

>Beyond the staggering valuation given the existing stock of gold, current prices make today’s annual production of gold command about $160 billion. Buyers – whether jewelry and industrial users,frightened individuals, or speculators – must continually absorb this additional supply to merely maintain an equilibrium at present prices. 

>A century from now the 400 million acres of farmland will have produced staggering amounts of corn,wheat, cotton, and other crops – and will continue to produce that valuable bounty, whatever the currency may be. Exxon Mobil will probably have delivered trillions of dollars in dividends to its owners and will also hold assets worth many more trillions (and, remember, you get 16 Exxons). The 170,000 tons of gold will be unchanged in size and still incapable of producing anything. You can fondle the cube, but it will not respond. 

>Admittedly, when people a century from now are fearful, it’s likely many will still rush to gold. I’m confident, however, that the $9.6 trillion current valuation of pile A will compound over the century at a rate far inferior to that achieved by pile B.

It has to do with human productivity and technological advances.

260,HTH," Your question is a little unclear. Nobody invests literally once with a small amount of money and calls that done.

You need money to make money. And the more money you have, the more it will make. So if you only have a little to start worth, absolutely invest it at once. BUT *then*, commit to regular ongoing contributions to the highest extent that you can afford. That’s how, over a period of many years, people are able to grow large amounts of wealth.

261,TTWO," Video game stocks are kind of like pharma stocks imo.  They come out with products every few years and it's anyone's guess as to how popular they will become; some pop and some flop.  The lumpiness of their earnings makes them hard to justify a consistent valuation.  The main driver is that video games will only become more popular, and TTWO is one of the more consistent producers of games.  For the average Joe, who doesn't have extensive relative value models, don't worry about valuation because you probably won't get it right and it'll bias you (who's to say it should trade at 33x, 25x, 35x, or 40x?).  Instead, just focus on whether the company's games are performing as you would expect them to compared to the other video game manufacturers.",DoobsNDeeps,2,/r/investing/comments/o1c6qn/hot_take_on_take_two_interactive_ttwo_thoughts/h208k6s/,0.037,0.873,0.09,0.8133
262,TTWO," There's a really fantastic, detailed and very funny nearly 40 minute or so video about what Rockstar could improve on and what's wrong with games like Red Dead (core aspects of Red Dead: Online were broken for months last year) but it's one of those things that may not ever matter. 

GTA: Online, I'm still playing 8 years later despite my complaints. The core of the games and the world is compelling enough that it remains compelling despite its faults, but you look at something like Red Dead: Online and it really is an example of one of the most remarkable canvases in video game history and after a few brush strokes, Rockstar basically went, ""that's good enough."" 

But people play and complain (look at Rockstar's Twitter comments after every RD: O update) and I think the potential keeps people coming back in the hopes that that potential gets realized...someday? And as long as people keep spending and playing, R*/TTWO think that good enough is okay.

And you'll get the updated GTA V for the new consoles, which probably won't really offer that much in the way of improvements. GTA VI is probably in a couple of years if not perhaps a tad less - hopefully sooner. I don't own TTWO at this point (have owned it at times in the past) but I'm not against the idea of owning it here, about where it was late last Summer. I have reasonable criticisms of TTWO's biggest franchises, but it probably won't ever matter - and it's a good business.
