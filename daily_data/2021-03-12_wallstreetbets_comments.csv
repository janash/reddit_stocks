The 275 call is 10 buys, or 1000 shares.  Since you can buy at 275, and instantly sell at 300, you make 25.00 a share, or 25,000.

A call is, to my understanding, you are essentially betting the stock will be a certain price at a certain time.

So GME is at 260 rn. People are talking about 3/12 800c so that's an investment where you bet GME will zoom up to 800 by end of day tomorrow. Unlikely but potentially a lottery ticket. 

These types of bets/options, called contracts, represent 100 shares of the stock. So a call priced at 8.50 is actually 850 bucks because, 100 shares. They are priced based on a bunch of stuff I didn't begin to research before I yoloed my grand.

We don't know when it will happen. Nobody knows. We can *hope* it happens today, or Monday, or next week, etc...but nobody knows. All that is accomplished by spreading these deadlines is that people get discouraged when they don't happen on that date.

GME is up from $40 two weeks ago and currently sitting at ~$270 premarket. We recovered from a massive dip almost instantly earlier this week. There are diamond handed apes everywhere and it's beautiful - but you all need to know that today could be a sideways trading day, a huge rocket to the moon, a partial rocket to the moon, or we could even see GME go down quite a bit today.

The hedge funds are trying to bail as many paper handed apes out of this as they can so they can save themselves. Don't let them trick you.

💎🙌🦍 = 🚀🚀🚀

Happy Friday!

Edit: Because this has taken off; I would like to note that having a squeeze today is not likely even though it seems many people have said that. If the price gets to $400+ it's because the long position players are trying to get as many calls ITM today so that when they execute those shares will have to be purchased (driving the price up). 

When this happens we're much more likely to see larger jumps in price and then, hopefully, eventually, a margin call when short positions will need to start to cover thus REALLY driving the price up.

This ain't happening on a Friday but we could see some nice price increases today. Who knows. Just don't get down if we don't have a huge day today.",Burnt_Couch,5395,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m3hkjf/gme_megathread_for_march_12_2021/gqorfwl/,0.006,0.876,0.118,0.9869

**ELI5 How do I know when to make a move?**

A lot of people have been asking me about when they should make moves regarding GME. Only you can answer that question for yourself. Here are the questions you should ask yourself with any investment.

1) What is the thesis behind your investment?

* Why did you invest? What makes you believe that the stock is actually more valuable than it's current price? If you don't know why you you're investing, how do you expect to know when to make moves?

* There is a lot of DD on GME. Read that DD and then do your own DD and decide why you're actually invested.

2) Has the information changed?

* If a stock price changes, did it change because of general volatility or because there is some new information out there? Remember that not everyone processes information at the same time, so some changes in information may take time to process in the actual price of the stock.

* A lot of people post their thoughts on GME, but you have to ask if your personal thesis on GME changed yet? 

3) What is your exit strategy?

* At what point will you move on from your investment?

* At what price do you want to sell GME?
 
**Corno4825, what is the purpose of your thread?**

If you're looking to me to decide on what to do with GME, please realize that I don't know what the fuck I'm doing. All of the thoughts, ideas, and information I post are thoughts, ideas, and information that you can come up with with yourself. I don't have insider knowledge on GME. I don't work at an investment firm. I haven't even been in the stock market for a year. 

I have YOLO'd all $2,000 I have into GME. I am fully invested in this stock. I will do everything I can to make money on the way up through the squeeze and on the way down after the squeeze. [I am currently up to $27,000.](http://puu.sh/Hot1X/da5fde54e5.png) What I'm doing is looking at the information presented to me, commenting on what I see, and reading the rest of the reactions around WSB to try and best understand that situation. Once I'm done with GME, I will probably move on to the next big Reddit stock as long as I believe that the thesis is strong and do the same thing there. If I can make enough money investing, I will quit my job and continue to make comments on Reddit until I get bored.

Let's have some fun today.

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

**8:30 Pre-Market Update**

GME is on the SSR again today. Theoretically that means there shouldn't be any attacks. I still think that the SHITs (Shorting Hedge Investors and Traders) have a way to circumvent the SSR, so if we see any major drops today, I'm not going to panic sell.

I still believe that there are a ton of shorts in the wild that need to close, so I believe that the squeeze potential is still on.

In order for the price to have a major shift today, GME needs to either have some new information come out about it's status, or there needs to be an influx in buying or selling power. Don't be surprised if we have another boring day today. With the SSR in place, it's going to be very difficult for the SHITs to manipulate the stock without serious scrutiny. 

Premarket, the price is up, but only a bit above where it ended on Wednesday. Unless anything changes, I'm assuming that ~265 is it's stability point and that any fluctuation around that number is just general volatility.

Shorts available: 750,000

Current Premarket Price: 269.40

**9:40 Update**

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Small but sizeable amount of buying pressure pushes GME right out the gate. We'll see if this is the start of some upward throttle or if GME will stall out at a higher balance price.

I do read all comments. I don't have access to chat because I'm on mobile. I will respond to important topics that I feel I can answer well.

Current price: 273.15

**10:45 Update**

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Upward trajectory seems to be there and it seems steady. The push started after 500,000 shorts were closed. 350,000 were borrowed at premarket, but I didn't see anything that indicates they were used for an attack. The 500,000 shorts were closed at opening bell. This seems to have started an ignition as GME has been steadily climbing so far. We'll see if this trend continues. 

Attacks from the 💩💩💩 I think are still possible. If 💩 1 sells shorts to 💩 2, 💩 2 could accumulate enough shares to force a sell attack. This is pricey as the selling of the short can only be done at a higher price than market value, forcing upward pressure. In order for this to succeed, 💩 2 will have to buy high, and sell low, losing money on the transaction if the attack succeeds. That means that they need the price after the attack to be significantly lower than where they started since they're paying such a huge premium to launch the attack. There's no guarantee that the attack would work, so they could just end up paying a huge premium and only be in a bigger hole. This seems an option only if they're desperate.

Shorts available: 900,000

Current price: 289.49

**10:50 Update**

[Help me research!](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m3hkjf/_/gqp86ua?context=1000) Maybe I can get y'all to find information that I find interesting to follow but can't do at work. I'd like to know open interest for call options ending this week. I think I remember a big spike at 300. I'm curious to see how many options will go ITM if GME breaks 300.

Current price: 289.60

**11:17 Update**

50,000 more shorts were covered. GME has stalled around 280.

Thanks to /u/littlemonky, I can research options on my phone! I'm getting really good at researching on my phone.

Here's what I'm looking at today. If GME ends at 280, 39,422 call options will be in the money. That is 3,942,200 shares that can be bought through the exercising of call options. If GME hits 300 (Up 7.14% from 280), call options ITM goes up to 51,921 (Up 29.06% from 39,422). I believe that the big percentage difference between price and options is whats going to continue to propel GME up. This was the case last week and could be the case again this week. If this hits 300, I wouldn't be surprised to see another week like this week, next week. Oh yeah, that doesn't take into account that shorts still need to be covered.

Exponential growth is hilarious.

My boss is probably wondering why I'm frequently taking 15 minute shits.  

Shorts available: 950,000

**12:40 Update** 

Lunch time! I promise I've done a lot of good work today. 

GME has been hovering around 278-280. Shorts remain steady. Upward momentum has stalled. Don't be surprised if we end the week hanging around here for the rest of the day.

**1:25 Update**

Small downward trajectory from GME. This is probably just general volatility. For most stocks, this amount of movement might be significant, but for GME I feel it's only significant if it continues. We'll see what happens in the next few hours. GME is still above the 265 close on Wednesday, so I consider that a victory. Two days in this price region shows that there's a lot of support and that a lot of people are holding on. Earnings are slowly creeping up and I would imagine that we will get some more important information before then.

I also read all comments sent to me. I don't have chat on my phone so I read those at home. I'm happy to respond to things if I feel that what I say will be helpful.

There seems to be some upward momentum. We'll see if it's sustains. I'll start getting really excited if it breaks past 280 again.

GME has hit another stall. This time around 275. Nothing else has changed.

**3:33 Update**

Anyone else notice how sharply GME fell after hitting 280? It's been on a downward trajectory dipping below 270. Power hour is here, and it seems some people are trying to make moves before the end of the weekend. I'm curious to see if there's going to be another rally to try and hit 280 before the end of the day.

Shorts available: 950,000

Current price: 270

**4:15 After Market Update**

Well that was annoying. GME just barely missed it's Wednesday close closing at 264.50. However that was with a couple of small attacks in the last few hours. Short interest hasn't changed, so there's are still a lot of shorts available.

Just over two weeks ago, GME was around $49 a share. If you didn't panic on Wednesday, but you're panicking now, ask yourself if anything has significantly changed over the past two days? From what I see, there have been a few skirmishes, but a fucking nuke was dropped on Wednesday and GME is still up around 75% this week.

I'm excited to see what happens next week.

Here's what I'm looking at today. If GME ends at 280, 39,422 call options will be in the money. That is 3,942,200 shares that can be bought through the exercising of call options. If GME hits 300 (Up 7.14% from 280), call options ITM goes up to 51,921 (Up 29.06% from 39,422). I believe that the big percentage difference between price and options is whats going to continue to propel GME up. This was the case last week and could be the case again this week. If this hits 300, I wouldn't be surprised to see another week like this week, next week. Oh yeah, that doesn't take into account that shorts still need to be covered.

Exponential growth is hilarious.

My boss is probably wondering why I'm frequently taking 15 minute shits.

**12:40 Update** 

Lunch time! I promise I've done a lot of good work today. 

GME has been hovering around 278-280. Shorts remain steady. Upward momentum has stalled. Don't be surprised if we end the week hanging around here for the rest of the day.

**1:25 Update**

Small downward trajectory from GME. This is probably just general volatility. For most stocks, this amount of movement might be significant, but for GME I feel it's only significant if it continues. We'll see what happens in the next few hours. GME is still above the 265 close on Wednesday, so I consider that a victory. Two days in this price region shows that there's a lot of support and that a lot of people are holding on. Earnings are slowly creeping up and I would imagine that we will get some more important information before then.

I also read all comments sent to me. I don't have chat on my phone so I read those at home. I'm happy to respond to things if I feel that what I say will be helpful.

There seems to be some upward momentum. We'll see if it's sustains. I'll start getting really excited if it breaks past 280 again.

GME has hit another stall. This time around 275. Nothing else has changed.

**3:33 Update**

Anyone else notice how sharply GME fell after hitting 280? It's been on a downward trajectory dipping below 270. Power hour is here, and it seems some people are trying to make moves before the end of the weekend. I'm curious to see if there's going to be another rally to try and hit 280 before the end of the day.

**4:15 After Market Update**

Well that was annoying. GME just barely missed it's Wednesday close closing at 264.50. However that was with a couple of small attacks in the last few hours. Short interest hasn't changed, so there's are still a lot of shorts available.

Just over two weeks ago, GME was around $49 a share. If you didn't panic on Wednesday, but you're panicking now, ask yourself if anything has significantly changed over the past two days? From what I see, there have been a few skirmishes, but a fucking nuke was dropped on Wednesday and GME is still up around 75% this week.

I'm excited to see what happens next week.

222,GME," I would like to remind everyone that GME is a war if attrition.

Whoever gives up first, is the loser.

GME **has** value, because there is confidence it will generate value. That means it's already having that priced into it.

GME isn't fundamentally flawed, or overpriced, or too expensive.

That means the shorts have the losing position. They always will.

Retail needs to ride the curtails of the momentum that other institutions will force into action *without notice*.

When the time is right.

This may sound ridiculous... but I can see shorters dragging this until they have amassed such an unbelievable loss it is catastrophic.

I'd almost argue that long positions are trying to bleed shorters for **even more than they currently owe** on purpose.

So just relax.

GME has value. Short positions are bleeding capital at the hip every day. This continues until the time is right. So be a part of market history. And be on the right side of it.

GME isn't worth 20 bucks. 40 bucks. 100 bucks.

It inverted a downward pressure so massive that it took 50% of the value off in 20 minutes. THE STOCK INVERTED THAT PRESSURE WITHIN A DAY.

So relax.

It really feels as if we are up against the very wheels of capitalism, I actually feel upset at the sheer amount of money being thrown at this/available to be thrown at this. 

Short interest is in the Billions of dollars, some entities have literally BILLIONS of dollars, not to create, enhance or uplift society, but to profit off of bankruptcy and extinction of ONE singular company. 

Every short ladder attack dropping the share price from $280 to $270 is another couple of million thrown in when the original entry point was in the SINGLE DIGIT dollar amount. Money just thrown in to the pit of despair to halt the rise. 

We are truly fighting an entity with near limitless resources, and when the day finally comes that we exhaust their options it is going to be an absolute bloodbath. 

I only bought 9 shares, I didnt see myself getting so invested in this personally. This has been going on for months now.

318,MS," Yeah, I see how the FPS issues would break it. I've actually only used standalone PCVR headsets at random booths or VR arcades every once in a blue moon, so can't really comment on their usability, but having tried MS Flight Sim on my headset, I'm really glad the Quest does its own reprojection instead of relying on the PC to do so. There's a clear difference on when it lags vs when the PC lags.

For crispness, yeah, 8K per eye would be ideal, with eye tracking because foveated rendering is a must at that resolution. Five years does actually seem like a good timeline there. Until then, we're gonna have smaller steps as an option. I'm actually having fun already at the Quest 2's resolution and even managed to use my PC through it pretty well with Oculus Link's virtual monitors, but you do you.

Just out of curiosity, which games did you play?

Alice owns shares in GME in her brokerage account, let's call it Fidelity. Bob borrows shares from Alice (via Fidelity, who is doing it invisibly because they're a broker and this is what brokers do) and sells them short. Bob eventually gets fucked on the shorts by you apes, so he's forced to pay back the shares he borrows or Fidelity will liquidate his ass. Bob buys shares on the market (important: not from Alice!) and hands them to Fidelity. Fidelity, of course, can lend them right back out to someone else.

[u/FatAspirations](https://www.reddit.com/user/FatAspirations/) and u/Jeffamazon I have a WILD theory so I need a reality check from ya'll, feel free to call me crazy...

We all know RC loves his cryptic tweets, and we also know he LOVES when his tweets have more than just one meaning attached to it, especially in his most recent ones.

Let's take the ice cream tweet first. It came the day after the news following the exit of the CFO and signaled that the ice cream machine was no longer broken, citing the same photo as an old [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/mcdonalds-near-you-with-working-ice-cream-machine-mcbroken-website-2020-10) article. BUT, as some have speculated, it also happened to be the dessert of choice during Chewy's first board meeting. Coincidence? Maybe, maybe not.

Next, the pets .com tweet. This tweet cited the same photo as an old [bizjournal](https://www.bizjournals.com/bizjournals/news/2014/12/11/throwback-thursday-remember-the-pets-com-sock.html) article, which mentions how the pets .com business concept didn't turn out to be that bad of an idea (just not for its time, as RC himself has explained many times during interviews), even using Chewy as a prime example. Clearly, he is trying to change the narrative on GameStop in the same way through his transformation to digital. INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH though, the actual screenshot from the article was taken from a [commercial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxH3UgCW9Cg) where the mascot says ""I like your shorts, buddy!"" Coincidence? Maybe, maybe not.

Finally, his most recent tweet. A lot of people have mentioned how this scene comes briefly after the ""landed on the moon scene"". There is some plausibility to that. But why the shitting scene in particular? Was it from the hedge funds dumping or shorting shares? A squeeze? All possible theories.

Recall that in the scene, the toilet is broken and he cannot flush his shit. Back in Jan. 28, the DTCC essentially forced multiple brokerages to shut down buying because there was a [PLUMBING](https://www.wsj.com/articles/clearinghouse-urges-faster-trade-settlement-amid-gamestop-scrutiny-11614175201) issue from the T+2 settlement process, resulting in hundreds of thousands of FTDs on Jan. 28.

How do all of these tweets all tie together? RC is elected Chairman of the Board (and/or maybe CEO) to lead GameStop's digital transformation, changing the narrative from a dying brick and mortar to a growing e-commerce, and through that process, recalls all  shares, thereby fucking the shorts.

482,HUGE," *Just about 2 years. But that's still a very short amount of time to move on from a CEO, especially one who took over a company that was already struggling. 

*Cohen's been filling the company/board with other people from Chewy for sure. But that's consistent with him having a powerful role on the board. It's not really an indicator that he intends to step into the CEO position.


*The board typically selects top management positions like CFO; it'd be more unusual if the CEO was on the selection committee. That doesn't mean he's still not involved in the process and/or giving his input. 


*Why do you attribute the last earnings to Sherman? The company's performance is what tanked the stock, and it's pretty unfair to straddle Sherman with that. That's like hiring a new coach for a 3-13 NFL team and then blaming him when they go 4-12 the next year. Add the pandemic into the mix, and of course the last earnings call was going to be shitty.


*There'd be notable restrictions on what Sherman can/cannot do with his stock even if he leaves. His shares won't be liquid for a while either way. Plus that doesn't really speak to Cohen becoming CEO anyway.



At the end of the day, I really hope you're right and Cohen steps in because that'd be a HUGE catalyst.

- Hedge funds sell their other stocks to pay for the eventual cost of GME.

- Other stocks go down, investors look elsewhere.

- Investors find GME, buy in to help their failing portfolio.

- Hedge funds see price of GME go up, can see it's going to end up costing them a lot, repeat step 1

I am as stupid as they fucking get when it comes to this stuff but even I can see this is a fight they are making worse for themselves by the very actions they're taking to try and fight against it.

And oh btw, people keep asking why they didn't learn their lesson the first time it spiked, why didn't they stop what they were doing.  I again can explain that very simply: they thought they won, GME had ""crashed"" and was headed down by every single metric they use to analyze this kind of thing.  They doubled down, decided to stick to their old plan, reassured themselves they weren't wrong at the start.  Now here we are.

Honestly, it could hit 500, 600, even a thousand dollars tomorrow.

....according to Ihor Dusaniwsky of analytics firm S3 Partners, the short squeeze will continue.

“We should see the GME short squeeze continuing and more short covering in the stock as mark-to-market losses mount,” he told Yahoo Finance late Wednesday. “But as the stock continues its rapid climb, there will be short sellers waiting in the wings looking for entry points if this rally loses steam and GME’s stock price retraces.”

Short interest may have fallen, but it’s still significant: $2.76 billion with 11.18 million shares shorted, 20.52% short interest percent of float or 17.02%, depending on how you calculate it, according to Dusaniwsky. (S3 prefers the latter, as it doesn’t count the synthetic longs created from a short sale. If this is confusing, S3 has a good explainer here.)

515,DTE," Definitely not recommending buying a 1 DTE or even weekly $800 call in but people have been making money on $800 calls.

518,EDIT," Price per share, each call represents 100 shares so multiply the call price x 100 to get how much it would cost to buy one contract.

Additionally, a common error is thinking you are good once you hit the strike price (in this case $800).  That is just the floor you need to not lose everything (worthless).  The break even price is strike plus price per share ($800 + $3.70 = $803.70). If on 3/19 at close, GME was at $803.70, my call would be worth exactly what I paid, $370.  Broke even.  No gain, no loss.  

This is very important for new options traders.  Great example is I bought 1 3/12 $260 call last Friday too.  It cost way more (specifically $36.79 per share, so $3,679 for one).  I would need GME to finish at $260 + $36.79 = $296.79 to break even.  Anything between $260 and $296 at end of day, I’d lose money, but not all of it.  Many think once they hit strike its all fat gains from there.  

But like my $800 call, I sold my $260 call yesterday for $76.87 ($7,687) rather than let it get close to expiration.  That same call is worth around $30 right now EVEN though GME as at $281 (as I type) which is $20 higher per share than when I sold yesterday.  Why?  Odds are shrinking.  It was more likely 24 hours ago (per the math underlying the option value) @ $260 something of hitting $296 or above today at 4pm than it is here close to noon with 4 hours left @281.

Thus diamond handing short term options is not good.  Stock went up but my option dived and could have ended up worthless by 4pm had I not sold for 2x yesterday.  That is time decay in action

Edit:  just to show volatility as time expires.  In time it took to write this, GME is still same price $280, but option has dropped more than 10%, now down to $26.  Rapidly losing value as expiration approaches

If you bought an option when the IV was high, and then the IV dropped, your option is going to be worth a lot less.

706,GME," Yeah, WSB is fun, but maybe too fun. The dopamine drip rush of yolo'ing my emergency fund at the first peak, seeing it crash, seeing it spike again and buying more shares when I have the money, the potential payoff, and spending my days daydreaming of being free of wage slavery. I can absolutely see how gambling addiction can happen.

I think after GME, I'm done with stock market bets. I'll stick around WSB for the memes, but I think it'd be too easy to go from ""Mmm, I have the extra money, maybe just *one* $10k options contract, just to learn what I'm doing"" to suddenly needing to go back to corporate America. With my current holdings, then *if* GME goes to $10k, and *if* I manage to sell around there, rather than missing the peak if I'm away from the internet for a couple days, then my return minus taxes should be ~$500k.

Half a million has always been (at least, since I've known FIRE was an option, as no school teacher I've ever had thought to tell me that retiring in your 30s or 40s was possible) my goal retirement number. $20k/year in perpetuity, and less if I draw on the principle, I can move to some low cost of living city and live my best life.

Like, even without investing, if you had $2.4MM, just drawing off it from a savings account, you could have $40k/year for 60 years. So many people live on way less than that. Ultra-wealthy people make me confused and frustrated, because not only do they keep more money than they could ever use (whatever, human greed, monkey want to see numbers go up, and for some people, RuneScape isn't enough), but more confounding to me, they just? keep? working?? Like, bitch, I'm out of here ASAP once I won't die by not going to work.

Edit: thank you for the updoots, fellow apes. 

I’d just like to add that I am very much _hoping_ to make bank with $GME, but that I will always hold shares in the company because I personally believe it is NOT a sub $1000 firm, and I like the stock. 

Do whatever you must do, individually. But for me, personally, I love that fact that Hedge Fund managers are sweating buckets and looking at their holiday homes and yachts and crying. 

I don’t know if that post circulating apparently from a Hedgie’s wife begging us to “stop stealing” their “earned” money from them being “harder working” and “smarter” than us is real. But it was like fucking chicken soup to my working middle class soul. 

Hedgies, and their shills; I know you’re reading this. I know you come here every fucking day so spread FUD and get papers hands to part ways with their investments. You preside over such egregious market manipulation and media bias the likes of which hasn’t been seen in a long, long time. You call us cheaters, but we’re just playing by the rules you fuckers have taken advantage of for decades. You call us fools, but you’re the ones who underestimated us and overestimated your ability to stay solvent. 

Let me tell you this, so you know, without a shadow of a doubt; set it in stone that I. AM. NOT. SELLING. 

Not at 10k, not at 100k, not at 500k. 

I want you to bleed. I want you to die from a thousand cuts. (Your ethically bankrupt companies that is). 

Beg me. Beg me for my shares. Offer me millions for them. I may listen. I may take pity on you. I’ll try to forget how you were remorseless and took no pity on us when you kicked us into the dirt and laughed at us for being “weak”. The images of you burning $100 notes while we protested our poverty was seared into my rage filled brain. Rage. Rage. 

The barbarians are at the fucking gates. Rome will fall. All the monuments to your many sins will be burnt to ashes. 

I will leave you with nothing. Less than nothing. But I won’t laugh at you. I won’t toast your misfortune or burn bank notes. No. 

I will ask you how it feels. How it feels to lose everything. How does it feel to be powerless? How does it feel to count pennies, to do without? To go hungry? To go cold? To fight through sickness just to earn enough for crumbs? 

Maybe when all that has come to pass. Maybe then I’ll sell my shares. Maybe.

After that, it's easy to hold onto the rest to see where it ends up.

726,GME," I mean, if you're gonna bandwagon a short squeeze and then refuse to participate in the short squeeze, you're an idiot who should probably find another stock to swing trade. It's kinda like how New Yorkers like to move to Vermont and then try to change Vermont to be more like New York. Fuck off and think about what attracted you in the first place.

It's less about morals and more about strategy. I'm not gonna frame selling GME as a betrayal, or being a sellout, or not holding the line or whatever. What I will say is this: selling GME during the last peak was an objectively idiotic move. The strategy was sound and well known, the numbers were in our favor, and all the data pointed to the simple mathematical fact that following a particular set of actions would yield a tremendously favorable result. Anyone who chose to deviate from that particular set of actions in order to secure a moderately favorable result is a massive fucking n00b.

That being said, conditions are fundamentally different now and there's no reason to avoid selling. Short interest is much lower (and set at a much higher price point), price movement is being driven by institutions rather than retail, volume is far too high to create artificial scarcity and hedgies aren't dumb enough to get fucked twice on the same play. There is nothing left to squeeze, and therefore, there is no tactical reason to be shy about selling. So anyone who's **still** saying ""yOu BetTeR hOLd"" at this point is also a massive fucking n00b.

762,GME," From what I have read on this sub, you got the gist of it, but missed one important part: someone needs to exercise the options and then hold.

 Apparently, selling naked calls normally means that the seller needs to buy some shares to hedge, so the price goes up. Then, when the shares are exercised, those shares that were tied up in options hit the market. When 1000 of contracts all hit the market on the same day, the price may go down.

 By the way, the upward pressure caused by options is called the gamma squeeze, you probably already know but someone reading this may not have seen this explained yet. 

 With GME, there may be people willing to buy and hold, but there are plenty of people willing to join the gamma gang. The short squeeze may end up being a longer play, but there are tons of people who like the stock.",thor_a_way,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m3d59w/forbes_on_gme_im_not_sure_they_even_know_yet_what/gqqabdn/,0.033,0.85,0.117,0.9209

I can relate, this past yr was hard for me too. Lost an amazing person in my life, my dad. Man was incredibly humble.

At his funeral, was the first time I heard all the good he had done in his life. From giving my mom's (at the time just his GF) cousin a place to live when he first came to the country. To housing the same cousin and his bride while they search for a home. Rent free, because they were expecting their first child and my pops told them save the money for the house, and for the babies needs.

And countless other stories. Loosing him has been hard . I'm angry we didnt have the money for him to have better health care, to find that tumor sooner. Im angry at myself for failing to have better means. It been hard. Harder on my mom since she knew him best and longest.

But in the darkness I've found some light.

Finding out how loving and supportive our family has been. From coming over and spending time with my mom so shes not alone while I'm at work. To my godson spending more time with her. To my cousins and sister  spending more time with each other and helping the younger cousins with school and problems. 

You appreciate what you have when someone so precious is lost. And even before their gone, u start seeing what to be thankful for.

This is not January where you guys got fucked, just because you become ITM it does not trigger a squeeze if you reach a price higher than option strike price is purchased.

you keep spamming same regurgitated shit without even reading what delta hedging is and a bunch of kids from highschools and universities read, upvote and believe this is true.

868,GME," Let's play with round numbers because it's simpler:

Assume that 3/12 800c is worth 1.00 at market open. You think GME will go up today, so you buy one of these.

And GME does go up! In the first 30 minutes of market, GME goes from 270 or so, to nearly 400.

The price of that 3/12 800c would be **skyrocketing**. Because big movement carries the price of options a lot. Maybe during that peak, the premium would become 2-3. So you'd 3x your money on a 35% underlying asset movement.

However, if the chart stays flat, or, worse, goes down, so does the price of the call. And rapidly, because it's same-day expiry.

So it's basically buying a ticking time bomb, with the only thing that can delay the timer being rapid price increase of the underlying asset. Even a moderate increase might not be enough to fight off the decay in value as expiry approaches.",Gugu42,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m32l1d/daddy_cohens_tweet_today_loud_ape_noises_commence/gqoqkwa/,0.081,0.822,0.097,0.1759

Mutual funds, most taking a 5% upfront cut and up to 1% a year. If that isn't bad enough, hedge funds (really wealthy pricks) seized the opportunity to relieve the help ( workers) of their retirement savings through periodic orchestrated crashes. Thereby taking these hard earned savings and buying a new yacht to snort their coke undisturbed. The Fed has been buoying the market since '08 to keep the lemmings invested.

He says “But there are some very good reasons why GameStop's business can succeed, so forget what Reddit is saying and instead look at why it can win.”

..And then goes on to list the 3 reasons of why GameStop can win as: 
1) The new e-commerce strategy is a good start
2) Still a destination where gamers can go
3) Don't forget new growth opportunities

1175,GME," Johnson noted that yesterday someone brought 44,845 weekly GME Mar 12, 2021 call strike options for ~$2.34 that have a delta of 0.046. This was a $10.5 million bet that GME stock would be over $800 in two days... that's correct two days.

....according to Ihor Dusaniwsky of analytics firm S3 Partners, the short squeeze will continue.

“We should see the GME short squeeze continuing and more short covering in the stock as mark-to-market losses mount,” he told Yahoo Finance late Wednesday. “But as the stock continues its rapid climb, there will be short sellers waiting in the wings looking for entry points if this rally loses steam and GME’s stock price retraces.”

Short interest may have fallen, but it’s still significant: $2.76 billion with 11.18 million shares shorted, 20.52% short interest percent of float or 17.02%, depending on how you calculate it, according to Dusaniwsky. (S3 prefers the latter, as it doesn’t count the synthetic longs created from a short sale. If this is confusing, S3 has a good explainer here.)

Edit 4: it might break upward at 2 but it looks like there is anew resistance line at 280.

the day is still young and i think we can see the start of a big ole gamma squeeze later today

Edit 8 @ 2:50: it broke out finally, let's see how easily we pass the next line of resistance!  It's very possible GME gets over 300 soon

Edit 9 @ 3: line of resistance at 280, getting closer towards another break out. After 280 I speculate 300 shortly after and if we see another breakout it will shoot up super high

1280,GME," As an environmental engineer who has been out of college for a long time and doesn't really need stats at his job, I'd have to do some reading to refresh, but I don't think you are analyzing this in a statistically relevant way.

Due to possible unknown market mechanics and perhaps other factors like tendencies for people to trade at whole dollar amounts, you cannot derive the probability of a whole dollar close directly. Rather, I believe you could estimate the true probability at high confidence by randomly sampling closing prices and performing elementary statistical operations on those samples.

You could then use that to estimate the probability of that event occuring X number of times in a given time frame using a poisson distribution or a related distribution for rare events.

Even at this, the case could be made that the results would not be statistically valid unless your sample of closing prices was across other stocks which are sufficiently comparable to GME, and perhaps that's not even possible at this point.",rokken2dokken,21,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m34tcc/gme_frequently_closing_in_whole_number_evidence/gqn7byf/,0.0,0.926,0.074,0.9161
1281,OI," I'd recommend learning more about ""pinning"" and the effect of hedging near high OI Options near expiration ([https://www.amazon.com/Option-Trading-Volatility-Strategies-Techniques/dp/0470497106](https://www.amazon.com/Option-Trading-Volatility-Strategies-Techniques/dp/0470497106)). Below is an excerpt, but I'd encourage you to read the chapter. 

""\[Pinning\] When the underlying settles at, or very close to, a strike at expiration it is said to have been pinned. This happens far more than we would expect if the price action were random and the strike prices were nothing special. For example, if strikes were $5 apart we would expect to be within 10 cents of a strike 0.2/5 = 0.04 of the time. 

 The first thing to state is that this effect is not the result of option market makers colluding in an effort to have their short option positions expire worthless. Deliberate manipulation of underlying prices certainly does occur, and this has been done around expiration. However, this is a costly exercise as a lot of stock needs to be traded. This generally puts this type of manipulation beyond the financial means of market makers. Also, pinning by deliberate manipulation would be easier in illiquid securities. But this is not where most pinning occurs. The pinning effect is indeed due to the activities of market makers but in a more complex way, and unless they are careful it can easily be to their detriment.

They're expanding more to PC gaming in order to sell GPU's and other components, along with a digital storefront for games (think Steam, Epic or GoG). All this is being led by a dude who knows his shit when it comes to digital sales. 

In terms of brick and mortar, all gaming generations to date grew up picking up consoles physically from the store. 

With more disposable income and shorter lifecycles of GPU's I can see plenty of people going through the doors to purchase hardware, especially after how bad online retailers shit the bed with the current wave of graphics cards, scalpers and hoarders abuse these outlets and cannot be regulated.

So, if my stock hits 13.80 (at current premium) by EOY, my ROI on the $10 contract is 100% greater than my $5 contracts, presuming I invested the same money into both flavors of calls.  The way I set it up with how many contracts of price ranges I bought, if UWMC hits $10 by EOY, I am even for the year.  Anything after that, my gains exponentially increase.  It is also worth noting that I *am* selling ridiculous OOM monthly covered calls as well on my shares as well to lower my cost basis.

Nintendo will have one of its biggest years this year with the sequel to “ Zelda breath of the wild and the Pokémon diamond and pearl remake which will surely have og fans wanting to play and maybe this will be their first switch or an upgrade. Regardless theirs a massive shortage and same sung needs to have OLED for its tv,phone,and tablets. Point blank the switch 1000% selling out even if there’s a reality inwhich it doesn’t appeal to many new people it will steal be snatch off the market by bots like the last model wii ,ps5,Xbox. Causing need for immediate restock which will be more profit for Mx . As a person of this generation you cannot deny that fact or any of the upside. It’s spread sheet is outstanding just like Unfi we’re. A monopoly just waiting to happen.

1470,RKT," You make a good point. In that depriving the rest of the market is a factor when it approaches a complete shut-out. Consider though that the FTC guidance's ideal examples use goods as the supply chain and market entrants as those most likely to be harmed. Here it seems harder to show brokers as goods easily shuffled away from competitors, and RKT is a big boy here--entering the cage and getting knocked out is different than being able to enter in the first place, which is why I said that an upstart mortgage company with no geographic reach would fit your approach a lot better.

Litigation is impossible to predict but, when the FTC guidance presumes the legality of a type of agreement, it's a toughie, and you'd want those exceptional details to be clear. I'm impressed by RKT's response, and it makes sense to not bring up the legal side until they can show harm (which they'd need to do) and that only happens in the future if UWM monopolizes the market to a pretty unsettling degree. In which case yeah, it'll probably turn into a legal battle. To your point, the legal challenge doesn't even have to win, it just needs to provide leverage through the lawsuit itself or via settlement.

1516,GME," Going to the movies (in turn, AMC) is one of those things that you don't realize how awesome it was until the option of going is taken away from you.

I had no idea the company was having financial straits before COVID and I was a frequent visitor to my local AMC. I'm pretty sure that a good chunk of the population didn't know either until WSB brought attention to it. WSB saved AMC just as it did with GME. Now that it's back under the spotlight, it's evident that AMC is taking advantage of the situation so they explore other options and prevent themselves from falling into that hole again.

Rumor has it Amazon is looking to become a large investor in AMC, the creation of new stocks could be solely to sell a large portion of the company to Amazon while allowing AMC to hold onto a controlling amount of the company's shares.

The way the CEO spoke about Redditors and the Meme stock movement was with love... I don't think he'd turn around and screw us all by halving our investments...

But looking at AMC'S past track record the stock was  worth an average of $14-$20 a share and even went up past $30 a share multiple times.... I know the past doesn't dictate the future of a stock but it can be used as an indicator of potential and I think AMC is a good bet buying in below $11... if the short squeeze doesn't happen it might take a year until AMC reports it's holiday earnings for 2021 but eventually I think its worth an investment 🤷🏻‍♂️

1542,AMC," Honestly I'm not sure but I think it totally depends.... 

The creation of new shares doesn't mean that all the new shares will be made available to the public... a company might do this if they are looking to take on a huge investor to allow the new investor to take a large share of the company without the Orginal company losing controlling amounts of shares. I've heard a lot of people saying with Amazon making more movies and running many ads in AMC theaters that Amazon is potentially interested in becoming a large investor in AMC. Which makes sense to me...  If this is the case we should expect the price to stay the same or maybe even increase in my opinion... 


It also just raises the cap on shares, so them doubling the number of shares doesn't mean that their will be double the amount of shares on the market, they can hold them as long as they want...


Also keep in mind we are pretty sure AMC is on our side, if you watched the interview with the CEO of AMC the way he spoke of us redditors and the meme stock was with love, he said he was shocked by the outpouring of support for the theater industry... I don't think he would want to turn around and fuck us all out of our money... so it's totally possible that this whole shareholder vote is a ruse, that they don't actually plan on doubling the number of shares but by forcing a shareholder vote they force all the shorts to be bought back before the vote... they could be initiating the squeeze for us in the only way they legally can...


Also keep in mind it's a shareholder vote, so the vote could come out as a No, and then there won't be the creation of an additional stocks...

1543,AMC," What exactly on page 67?? Because what I saw was


""The January 2021 conversion by holders of all $600 million of the Company’s 2.95% Convertible Senior Secured Notes due 2026 into shares of our Class A common stock at a conversion price of $13.51 which resulted in the issuance of 44,422,860 shares of our Class A Common Stock and reduced annual cash interest expense by $17.7 million"" 

The key word is Conversion, they didn't dilute they simply converted from inter company investment into common stock... 

Dilution happens when you create new stocks out of thin air...

Think of it like two glasses of whole milk, Glass A is common stock and Glass B is AMC'S Ownership portion... both cups have the same milk in them... when the conversion happened AMC took Cup B and poured a little into Cup A, there's still the same amount of Milk in the combined glasses. What this means is AMC takes a little less profit when they make money. Now the creation of new stocks, which might happen on May 4th is like taking Both cup A & B and adding water to it... yeah the cups are fuller but there's still the same amount of milk in the glasses but the milk is thinned out by the addition of something new aka water aka new stocks...",BisexualFag69,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m3gbxz/the_next_two_months_are_going_to_be_crazy_for_amc/gqpvj8k/,0.0,0.921,0.079,0.8827

1551,RKT," There may be a downward trend over the last month, but this stock has a real catalyst coming up with it's index inclusions.  In the mid-term, Q1 and Q2 should yield massive earnings, which could lead to a dividend increase and/or a special dividend payout.  Long-term outlook is as-good or better than any other mortgage company as they are utilizing and further developing tools to shorten closing periods and lower closing costs.  And if they build a record of regular dividend payouts they could easily be included in dividend funds.

Real short term catalysts, realistic potential mid-term catalysts, and good long term prospects for growth on a dividend stock with a cheap entry point, seems like a good buy to me.
