I think if your time horizon is 2+ years the 529 is a great option but the 5% interest rate is very tempting for a guaranteed return on funds you'll need sooner.

22,USA," It is a no win situation, so unmitigated disaster is the starting expectation. You have China as a growing rival to the USA and Tiktok as one of the most prominent successful products from China. 

Over the past 5 years, I have seen a rhetorical shift towards viewing China and Chinese as a rival threat. Everyone is one-upping each other with hawkish positions. Resulting in de-globalization and antagonism. Chinese policy has contributed big time to this antagonism as well. It saddens me that we as a human race are moving towards antagonistic positions, but maybe this was an inevitable prisoners dilemma like situation.",taguscove,13,/r/investing/comments/121qw3u/did_tiktok_ceo_really_suck_that_bad_compared_to/jdn7we8/,0.181,0.707,0.112,-0.7785
23,AI," TL;DR  Mr. Chow is really a good man, he is true and sincere. But he has no power over those decisions and he cannot stop data access/manipulation/propagation from CCP to TikTok. Neither will Project Texas. This is not his fault, and it’s purely CCP’s fault.

As a Chinese super familiar with TikTok/Bytedance situation I want to clarify it since I see so many misunderstandings of it.

1. Yes, Tiltok CEO is a good man, he shows good class during testimony, and people love the way he talked. *But this is not enough*

2. In the real operation of TikTok, Mr. Chow, aka TikTok CEO has NO POWER or anything to make any big company decision. He must always yield to  Bytedance and even Douyin.

This is not a secret at company at all, everyone knows he is a puppet put there with no real power.

As you can see he keeps answering that he is Singaporean during testimony when they asked if he will follow China’s laws.

It’s hilarious because yeah you don’t need to follow China’s law cause you are Singaporean,  but what about your employees at China, what about those “super admin” backdoor?

3. Americans really don’t understand how TikTok operates. Bytedance is the parent company of both TikTok and Douyin (Chinese version). Another thing hilarious is TikTok is banned in China, because CCP doesn’t allow such foreign APP.

Most codes development, AI algorithm training of TikTok are completed in China at very beginning, even they hired lots of people in America now this doesn’t change anything. SWE at America need to work at China time zone because all PMs making decisions come from China. Similar to algorithm training, they still heavily depend on Employers in China to train the model.

Don’t tell me about Project Texas, it’s useless and didn’t solve any problem IMO. The project started like 2/3 years ago and now it’s still a mess. You can find lots of reports online but IMO the core issue is employers in China doesn’t follow the procedures at all and there is no consequence in China for it.

4. And this is the most scary and important thing I want to talk about. In China, employers won’t get punished if they didn’t follow correct procedures, laws and even constitutions (see what Xi did for his third term?). But there will be *consequences* if they didn’t follow CCP’s order.

The same thing happened to TikTok, Douyin and Bytedance. Yeah Mr. Chow has no consequences cause he is Singaporean, again, what about all of his employers at China?

On top of that, China published a few strict laws recently years, focusing on two things, 
(1), technology such as AI algorithm is national security and any such technology transfer to foreign companies need to be approved by Chinese government. Now you tell me even without using your brain that if they will allow TikTok to transfer technology to foreign.

(2) Every Chinese in mainland China has obligations to cooperate with government for any search, data access related to national security issues.
I want to highlight here (2) is written into a law. And the definition of national security purely depends on Chinese government and CCP alone. Don’t be silly if you think you can hire some lawyer to fight it in courts like America did. If you do so you will disappear in China, it’s that simple.

And now Mr. Chow, as a Singaporean and no real power CEO, you tell me, how do you prevent such direct data access and manipulation from CCP to TikTok algorithm/data, when your core engineers lie at mainland China and they will obey the Chinese law?

He has no answer, he cannot answer such question, but I as Chinese know the answer, and I think anyone with social experience will get the same conclusion as I do.

Not to mention that there already exists something called “super admin” in company that can be used by CCP to direct locate anyone they want to search. And in fact as an example they did it last year to locate a journalist which criticized Beijing.

Now just imagine what’s gonna happen on TikTok when China invaded Taiwan, (this is something Xi will definitely do, just a matter of time), it will become a perfect propaganda tool.

Even for now if you search on TikTok for Ukrainian war you can find a huge amount of negative information about Ukraine and praises of Russia. And IMO this does expose a huge national security to not America but whole world. I don’t want to live in a world where CCP controls everything.

In conclusion, Mr. Chow is really a good man, he is true and sincere. But he has no power over those decisions and he cannot stop data access/manipulation/propagation from CCP to TikTok. Neither will Project Texas. This is not his fault, and it’s purely CCP’s fault.

Why?

Because that's what you do.  That's how you fight.  You either collect your opportunities or you fall behind and lose.  TikTok is one such tool, a social and data-oriented one.  It will remain dormant until it's needed, although they're probably using to collect data as we speak.

There are legitimate reasons to buy individual stocks if you know the company/industry/sector especially well and you know what they're up to.  Not insider information, just specialty knowledge.  It's not rocket science and there generally aren't many companies you as an individual would have insight into, but don't blow this off altogether.

For example, I'm up 25% in just three  months even in this turbulent market, by buying a bunch of shares in my previous employer when I learned what they are up to.  I know the leadership and how well they execute.  I understand the upside ramifications of what they are trying to accomplish.  Now the market is starting  to figure it out the implications.

If you want you can start by reading the seminal articles on the topic that put the final nail in that coffin of active management INCLUDING picking stocks (security selection):  BHB (beebower/ hood/ brinson) and its follow up study BSB (beebower/ singer/ brinson) published in JFA in circa early 1990's.  

Here is a brief overview of the study:  The took the topic pension fund managers in the country (top 100 or so).  Those are the ones that have access to the top money managers in whatever industries they wanted to invest in at that time.  They then looked at their returns.  They compared their returns to what their returns would have been if they invested in the same type of stocks using a index passive approach.  They found they LOST money with their security selection AND market timing techniques.

Of course this sent shock waves through the finance community.  No one believed it.   They repeated the study using the next 10 years of data and published those results as the BSB study.  Again same results.  So guess what Wall Street does?  Make sure NO ONE ever hears about these studies ever again.

As I mentioned the PURPOSE of asset allocation is  *""to come up with a risk level you are comfortable with since each asset class carries different risk levels and volatility.""*

So, WHY In the world would you add another risk that you can not control (single company risk or its similar version if you are talking about bonds) and are not even compensated for taking on by choosing an individual bond??  Just pick a index bond fund.  

Now, if you argued with me why choose to pay an expense ratio instead of buying gold direct and store it myself at home or whereever at a cheaper price that makes sense as passive vehicle there is no better then you buying it yourself.  

Commodities via a CCF is a completely different discussion as there is a reasonable argument if the current long only version investment vehicles can even capture the full  rollover return (backwardation).  So I'll give you that maybe a managed futures there is a better option if you want to play in that end of the pool.

If you're willing to truly *invest* the money for years (decades, really) then a good choice would be an S&P500 index fund, such as VOO or SPY. 

You can cash it out any time you want - but it could be up 10% next year, or it could be down for two years. But over  the 100+ year history of the US stock market, the S&P500 on average returns ~7% per year over long time frames. This means a $2500 investment would be worth $5k a decade later and $10k after two.

I have an account with Interactive Brokers UK (it's an ""ISA"" account) which I treat as ""buy-only"" (I put in money, buy stuff over time, forget about it). So my ""horizon"" is until ""I absolutely have to touch that money"" which may be 20 years or so...

I want to buy some gold and my preference would be for something that is focused on physical gold so [I did some research](https://www.google.com/search?q=gold+physical+etf) (i.e. googled it).

One thing I discovered was this piece of information:

>The diversification principles of the regulatory investment fund framework (UCITS) do not allow to launch a UCITS fund with only one constituent. Due to this fact, gold is mainly available as an exchange-traded commodity (ETC) in European countries. These products are certificates issued by a financial institution collateralised with physical gold. In contrast to the EU, Swiss regulation allows ETFs for single commodities like gold.

This made me pause, as I am not familiar with UCITS so I do not understand if it provides some form of ""protection"" that applies to ETFs, or it's just a technicality that ""you can't call this an ETF"" but has no other impact.

Either way, I have so many questions:

1. Since ETCs are basically **certificates issued by a financial institution collateralised with physical gold**, does that mean they are only as safe as the ""financial institution"" that issued them? Like if bank X issues an ETC and bank X goes bankrupt, you lose the money because the gold is not actually yours?
2. How do I find out who ""backs"" an ETC? For example [SGLN](https://www.ishares.com/uk/individual/en/products/258441/ishares-physical-gold-etc-fund) is one near the top results list.
3. How else do I compare ETCs? Clearly the ""backing institution"" is important as per (1) but is there anything else to look at?
4. What is UCITS and does it provide any extra ""protection"" due to its regulations? Would I be better off buying an ETF with part physical gold and part something else? Then what gold-heavy ETFs would you recommend that are UCITS-compliant?

Thank you all.

95,USA," Which mutual/index fund to invest cash in my Roth IRA?

I saved money while working in a job without retirement benefits years ago. I didn’t realize that I never invested this portion of the money I had in the Roth IRA I opened. I recently switched from Vanguard to Charles Schwab so the other portion of my account is in VTTSX. I know that I could buy FZILX or another similar fund but I don’t really know which one as I am new to I investing. 

Some background: I am not planning on contributing to my new jobs Roth 401K until my emergency fund is full for 6 months of expenses at least.

* How old are you? What country do you live in?  
I am 26 and live in the USA

* Are you employed/making income? How much?

I make $90K/year + a variable bonus

* What are your objectives with this money? 

Do something other than just have it sit in my account. 

* What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs?

98,USA," I am confused , A roth IRA is a retirement account, you probably do not want your emergency fund inside a Roth IRA

For a Roth IRA I would invest in broad market index funds like SWTSX (Broad market USA index) and if you want some foreign exposure SWISX what is a broad market foreign fund (however it only holds developed markets)

Now those fund are risky in the short term, they are not suitable for short term savings like an emergency fund , long term (20+ years) you could say they are safe. Meaning they could drop 50% tomorrow , but over 20+ years you should see good returns so again these are LONG TERM holds

For an emergency fund I would do something very safe like a money market mutual fund  SWVXX this fund shouldn't lose value and give a fair interest rate",SirGlass,1,/r/investing/comments/121g2oo/daily_general_discussion_and_advice_thread_march/jdnil8q/,0.06,0.733,0.207,0.9745

103,IMO," I'd prefer a little heavier holdings in mid/small. 

and I'd definitely add some international exposure. 

but otherwise you're fine. nothing wrong with your current portfolio. 

>I'm not quire sure if this is a solid strategy, mostly about the stock part.

there are different opinions on the subject. IMO there's a case for bonds in every portfolio. if you look at the long-term bonds vs. stocks returns, bonds will beat stocks about 1 year out of every 3 or 4, and bonds usually go up when stocks go down. not always, but more often than not. back in the dot com bubble, bonds beat stocks by over 10% a year 2000-2002. https://www.thebalancemoney.com/stocks-and-bonds-calendar-year-performance-417028

104,USA," 2Y is short enough that I'd definitely consider CDs and Cash options.

I don't know what money markets are available in your area, its very country dependent. But a money market fund like SWVXX or VMFXX in the USA is going at basically the federal funds rate (4.5%, with expectations to reach 4.75% or so now that the FFR was upped this past week).

Do you know what the risk-free rate in your country is, and what the best way to invest into it is?

---------------

So a substantial portion of your savings _should_ be cash, because 2Y just isn't a very long time. Cash is always safest, but usually makes the least amount of money.

115,CD," Yes your VMFXX and other short term noOrLowPenaltyCDs/tBill/mmf/hysa/etfs/mf are the way to go right now as fed fund rate is expected to stay at least 5% through 2023.

In 2024 or 2025 when rates are expected to drop you might want to lock up longer durations; just before it occurs. (Change from MM to CD.)

The only reason you would consider mid or long right now is if you are not good at following the fed announcements, or if a particular long gets you a significant 1% higher return, etc.

EDIT:

A mid 2-3yr tnote/cd/bond means wasting 1yr of early lockup, worse it might then have to renew right in middle of a lower rates period.

But if game for 5-10yr durations and find a 5% offer by all means just pull the trigger now. As one year early won’t make a difference in the grand scheme of things; unless fed rate goes to 7% which is looking very unlikely - much more inclined to do something like hold at 5% for 3+ years instead of breaching past 6% - fed mentioned only doing one more increase this year.",Latter_Run_6763,2,/r/investing/comments/121sz6t/why_do_cd_when_you_have_better_rates_on_the_money/jdn8mz6/,0.045,0.877,0.078,0.8067

If you think you’ll need the cash sooner then select a shorter term like 3 months or a MM fund. Or find an online bank. 

Many people, like myself, haven’t done CDs until recently when rates shot up. They didn’t make sense. I’m kinda glad the FDIC didn’t offer “global insurance” on all deposits, then there would be no incentive for banks to offer decent interest on deposits
