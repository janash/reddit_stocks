0,ATH," Now that they're not capped at 10%, I would expect them to increase their position in Tesla over the course of the next month, especially given that stock 30% down from its ATH. They have repeatedly said that it is their highest conviction play. One might even think that this was part of the reason they are allowing themselves to invest up to 30%. (That said, I can't imagine them being 30% Tesla. Maybe 20%. Even then that's billions and billions worth of Tesla shares purchased in the next few weeks / months.)

32,FSD, Tesla’s FSD could turn them into the most valuable company ever in a matter of months. It all depends on how fast they can finish the FSD software to enable Robo taxis. Once the software works well enough they can deploy it to their entire fleet which already has all the hardware needed to enable self driving. No other car manufacturers have a fleet they could do that with. FSD team seems to be making a lot of progress in the last year with their new tooling. They would go from making $10k profit per car to $100k per car or more even. But of course this seems so outrageous that most people won’t entertain the idea until Tesla proves they have the tech done.

117,WFC," >I don't understand bonds at all. I guess they could have an advantage, and rates could still go down, meaning the value of the bonds goes up, but with a lot of relatively stable dividend stocks available, I don't understand the reason to buy bonds.

I don't think rates will be going down any time soon.  I don't understand the dynamics completely, but it seems like the combination of inflation fears plus better returns to be had in the stock market, real estate, or even in crypto are pushing people away from bonds.

As for reasons to buy, maybe I'm being a dummy for taking advice on Reddit to heart, but I read this one comment from a guy who's been in the market for awhile and how he was 100% in equities in 2008.  He said his stocks (as they did for everybody) eventually recovered, but with each crash brings the fear that ""this time is different, stocks will never recover"".  In fact that was pretty much the case for Japan after their boom in the 80s.

That, plus the age-old advice of diversification had me wanting to get a little bit of bond exposure.

>I do 100% stocks, but have a bunch of what I consider replacements for bods, a utility (SO), a pipeline (WMB), a telecom (VZ and VOD), and an insurance (AFL). they still move a little, but I don't think there is a danger of losing a lot of money or taking a dividend cut. I could be wrong, I was with WFC, although it came back a lot and may restore its dividend.

This is not bad advice.  Actually my equities portfolio is pretty defensive as well.  For that reason maybe I can't really get much more risk reduction from more defensive stocks.  Bonds, as another asset class, just give me one more line of defense.  That's my thinking at least.

I don't know much about these so I'll take a look.",shortyafter,3,/r/investing/comments/mfdia0/thinking_about_getting_out_of_bnd_and_picking_up/gsmynf9/,0.088,0.797,0.115,0.6966
118,AAPL," I look at it as a diversification play and another place to park cash.  A quick look at $T shows a pretty big drop from Covid-19 from which it still has not fully recovered.  Accounting for the dividend still fails to get things back to where they were.  However, a bond during this same time period would maintain its principle and continue accruing interest which can be redeemed at any time.  Series I bonds in particular are adjusted bi-annually in order to keep up with inflation.

There's always the opportunity cost of not being in assets which have really done well, like AAPL, for example.  But that's the whole point: lower risk, lower reward.  If the whole market tanks tomorrow, AAPL will go with it.  The bond goes nowhere.  An index fund might, but an individual series I bond retains its face value.

But I understand your logic.  This is just the approach I am considering and which I feel fits my needs.",shortyafter,2,/r/investing/comments/mfdia0/thinking_about_getting_out_of_bnd_and_picking_up/gsn0x2g/,0.057,0.832,0.111,0.8365

120,TDF," You’re looking at investments as though losing money on your principle in the short term matters. I’m going to assume that you’re young since the TDF split that was recommended to you was 90/10. If that’s the case, a decrease in the share price of div stocks doesn’t matter. You could also argue that if you had been parking cash there since 2005 the share price would be up 50%. Invest in 2012? No movement. You’ll still be yielding roughly 7% YoY on your initial investment.",hayfhrvrv,1,/r/investing/comments/mfdia0/thinking_about_getting_out_of_bnd_and_picking_up/gsn2gtm/,0.078,0.832,0.091,-0.2023
121,IMO," I just made my account and bought. Definitely low tech, but manageable.

You're exactly right.  Locked in for a year.  There is a penalty in the first 5 years but they only dock the previous 3 months interest.  So not bad IMO.",shortyafter,1,/r/investing/comments/mfdia0/thinking_about_getting_out_of_bnd_and_picking_up/gsngafl/,0.117,0.672,0.211,0.6697

124,MP," Got about $500 in cash I’m sitting on and am unsure where to put it.

Anyone have any interesting plays they’d like to share?

I looked into $SKLZ but wasn’t too impressed. I also considered buying the dips on MP Materials or Palantir and averaging down my current investments in those two but would be open to something new if anyone has something intriguing.

My core portfolio is solid so I’m just trying to play with these $500. Anything undervalued at the moment that you guys have your eyes on?",grave_miscalculation,1,/r/investing/comments/mflatw/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/gsoi1vs/,0.015,0.819,0.166,0.9137
125,FLY," So back in January when looking for value buys, I decided to get in on $FLY when it was at 10$ and so far it’s been a slow grind up to about 13$

It was announced this morning that the Carlyle Group will be acquiring FLY, and paying 17.05$ a share premium.

Does this mean, when the deal is closed around Q3, I’m guaranteed 17.05? Should I hold and see if the price goes above 17.05 until the deal is closed? It up to 16.65 in pre market so should I buy more to take advantage?

Just not sure what to do, in this situation.
