If the hedge fund entered into TRS with prime brokerage, which means they are entitled to the return of the underlying asset without owning it in exchange for a interest rate. When the TRS matures one party has to pay the difference in nominal value of the referenced asset. Therefore, the TRS receiver has to deposit a margin in order to pay for the difference at maturity of the swap. (If the underlying asset price drops) Therefore, if the underlying asset drops in price the TRS emitter increases margin requirements for the hedge fund. Now with the secondary offering, some prime brokerages  margin called the hedge fund meaning they closed the TRS. Now if the TRS emitter also hedged against the position and bought the underlying asset he now has to sell it cause there is no need for the asset anymore and they only care about getting as much money back as possible.",entrepreneur-mike,1,/r/investing/comments/mfike5/failure_of_the_fund_to_meet_margin_commitments/gsq1whm/,0.054,0.783,0.163,0.9629

130,NOW," Archegos Capital Management is (was?) a hedge fund that utilized a long/short investment strategy to obtain a higher degree of leverage in their investments. Basically they borrowed some stocks to sell short in the past to give them immediate $$$, while only having to pay a small fee to the owner of those stocks. They were betting that those stocks would decrease in price so when they eventually have to return them, they can buy them on the open market for a cheaper price than they were sold for. They used their profits from selling those stocks to invest long in other companies, just like you or I would buy shares of a company to invest in them, hoping that the price increases. Weighting this strategy more toward the short side increases the leverage of their portfolio, and it looks like Archegos was very heavily leveraged. 

The bets that Archegos made didn't pay off. The stocks sold short didn't decrease in value; they actually increased, meaning that Archegos owes the owners more than they sold those stocks for originally. The long bets they made didn't work out either... the stocks they invested in decreased in price. Now, the owners of the stocks sold short (the banks) realize that Archegos is a house of cards and want to recoup as much money as possible before the other banks realize and pull the trigger first. This is where the margin call comes in. Basically the banks ask for their borrowed shares back, NOW, and Archegos has to buy back the shares they sold to give back to the banks. But wait, the amount required to pay back is more than all of the long holdings of Archegos as it stands today. SO, the banks take control of Archegos portfolio, liquidate everything (sell all of their stocks) and recoup as much of their losses as possible. This amounts to billions of dollars of stock sold off in some big names like Viacom and Discovery, which you can see reflected in their massive decrease in price over the last few trading days.",LiftUni,32,/r/investing/comments/mfrova/ahchegos_capital_management/gspssik/,0.025,0.91,0.065,0.9226

187,DD," Fan of Sony at the minute and will put my DD as a one of the many considerations for buying Sony 
Sony (SNE) DD. First, their image and sensing division. Currently, Sony has a staggering 53.5% share of the image sensor market with Samsung being in second with only 18.1%. Why do image sensors matter so much, well, image sensors are key for cameras, medical imaging equipment, security and surveillance, ai and robotics, barcode readers, phones (your phone will have Sony parts unless it's a Samsung) and most lucrative of them all, autonomous vehicles.This currently brings in 26% of Sony's revenue, at a 13.5% margin.                                
 
Next is Sony music, the biggest music publisher in the world. They have some of the biggest names in the industry, with artists like Ed Sheeran, 21 savage, childish gambino, DJ Khalid and more. And as music streaming grows (with Spotify reporting 29% year over year growth, and tencent music  70%), Sony will be in a great position to dish out music from its signed artists. Music makes up 16% of Sony's revenue at a margin of 20%.( I will talk more about ""other "" at the end of the DD, but just so you know, other is grouped into music).                                  

Next is playstation. Sony has managed to do something quite brilliant with playstation, they have managed a transition from physical games to digital games, why does that matter, well, digital games gives sony higher margins. But the most exciting aspect of playstation is ps plus, ps plus has went from only 4m subscribers back 6-7 years ago, to having 48m subscribers, more than HBO max, and actually, ps plus now has a bigger operating profit than Netflix, whilst Netflix had 2x the market cap of the entire Sony business. And that number of ps plus subscribers is only set to grow, with gaming being the fastest growing aspect of entertainment. It is also likely that we will give our children PlayStation's, who will in turn give their kids kids PlayStation, like how whole families come together to watch the Simpsons. You may be thinking of their competitor, Xbox, but Xbox has only really solidified in North America and western Europe, with Sony significantly beating them Asian market. Revenue 26%, operating margin 13%.                                           

Next is Sony pictures, a company you may be familiar with, they have made everything from the smurfs, Spiderman and the shark tank. You may know of the ongoing streaming war, and one of my favourite quotes is don't make wars, provide ammo, which is exactly what Sony is doing. You may not know but Netflix don't actually produce their exclusives, they out source it, and one of the studios they outsource it to is Sony, Sony has made quite a hit for Netflix, The crown, with a reported 73 million households watching it. But Sony pictures doesn't just do work for Netflix, they also have done Alex Rider, a prime exclusive and Greyhound, an apple TV exclusive. Sony pictures brought in 8% of revenue at a 9.6% margin.           

Next is Sony electronics, who make things from headphones, televisions and their world renowned camera's, there are countless videos on YouTube, of people positively speaking of their switch of Nixon to Sony, showing a high brand loyalty in the photography market. 10% of revenue at a 6.6% margin. 

Next is financial services, I can't comment too much on them, as I didn't research them thoroughly, but I can say that their revenue is  10% at a 10.6% margin. 

Now I will discuss other. So first up is Sony's quiet move into monopolising anime, the second fastest growing aspect of entertainment, they have acquired crunchy roll, funimaton, aniplex and more. This means that if will be very hard for other streaming services to compete with Sony's anime, like how it was hard to compete with Netflix. A another quote from my favourite business book is be best or be first, and Sony are doing both in the anime market.                                                                               
 
Next is Sony's car, I feel it's a marketing stunt to show off and advertise their parts to other automakers, but it really shows what Sony is capable of, with Sony audio in the car, sony image sensors, Sony infotainment and more. 

Lastly is their mobile game, I again can't comment too much on it but it is very popular in Asia and brings in 1 billon in revenue, any questions feel free to ask.

This is on top of the fact that [AWS provides a great deal of Amazon's profits](https://www.investopedia.com/how-amazon-makes-money-4587523).

I don't think rates will be going down any time soon.  I don't understand the dynamics completely, but it seems like the combination of inflation fears plus better returns to be had in the stock market, real estate, or even in crypto are pushing people away from bonds.

As for reasons to buy, maybe I'm being a dummy for taking advice on Reddit to heart, but I read this one comment from a guy who's been in the market for awhile and how he was 100% in equities in 2008.  He said his stocks (as they did for everybody) eventually recovered, but with each crash brings the fear that ""this time is different, stocks will never recover"".  In fact that was pretty much the case for Japan after their boom in the 80s.

That, plus the age-old advice of diversification had me wanting to get a little bit of bond exposure.

>I do 100% stocks, but have a bunch of what I consider replacements for bods, a utility (SO), a pipeline (WMB), a telecom (VZ and VOD), and an insurance (AFL). they still move a little, but I don't think there is a danger of losing a lot of money or taking a dividend cut. I could be wrong, I was with WFC, although it came back a lot and may restore its dividend.

This is not bad advice.  Actually my equities portfolio is pretty defensive as well.  For that reason maybe I can't really get much more risk reduction from more defensive stocks.  Bonds, as another asset class, just give me one more line of defense.  That's my thinking at least.

210,AAPL," I look at it as a diversification play and another place to park cash.  A quick look at $T shows a pretty big drop from Covid-19 from which it still has not fully recovered.  Accounting for the dividend still fails to get things back to where they were.  However, a bond during this same time period would maintain its principle and continue accruing interest which can be redeemed at any time.  Series I bonds in particular are adjusted bi-annually in order to keep up with inflation.

There's always the opportunity cost of not being in assets which have really done well, like AAPL, for example.  But that's the whole point: lower risk, lower reward.  If the whole market tanks tomorrow, AAPL will go with it.  The bond goes nowhere.  An index fund might, but an individual series I bond retains its face value.

But I understand your logic.  This is just the approach I am considering and which I feel fits my needs.",shortyafter,2,/r/investing/comments/mfdia0/thinking_about_getting_out_of_bnd_and_picking_up/gsn0x2g/,0.057,0.832,0.111,0.8365

217,FLY," So back in January when looking for value buys, I decided to get in on $FLY when it was at 10$ and so far it’s been a slow grind up to about 13$

It was announced this morning that the Carlyle Group will be acquiring FLY, and paying 17.05$ a share premium.

Does this mean, when the deal is closed around Q3, I’m guaranteed 17.05? Should I hold and see if the price goes above 17.05 until the deal is closed? It up to 16.65 in pre market so should I buy more to take advantage?

Just not sure what to do, in this situation.

7.7k free cash from sales and prior free cash, 46k in CVX, 25k DIS, 11k T . These are all 15+ year positions as far as I'm aware, and have treated me well so im just sticking with them for now. 

I dont know what to do with the 7.7k though. Im not optimistic about the market at all, from a noobs glance, my moneys on it going down a lot in the next 5 years. What can I do to protect myself?

237,EA," > Not found. It has no switching cost, like other players in this industry. Has no scale advantage and has no intangible assets that create business advantages like EA. EA license with sport and player make it can’t be replicated by other titles. Unlike Call of Duty players that can move to Fortnite, Valiant, or Counter-Strike. Warcraft players could migrate to Blade and Soul, Elder Scrolls, or Final Fantasy XIV. So, due to the absence of a strong economic moat, we hope to get a discount to ensure we are within the margin of safety.

this is the most wall street analysis of a gaming company ever lol

I'm not gonna mention activision's immense library of titles as well because I don't know that side of the company as well but...

Blizzard has some of the most valuable intellectual property in video games, right up there with Halo/God of War/Last of Us and they're very experienced in effectively monetizing their platforms. Diablo 4 and Overwatch 2 are some of the most anticipated games of the next two years and will likely be played for an entire decade (assuming all goes well). There are literally entire sports leagues dedicated to the games blizzard creates (Hearthstone, OW, SC2 for awhile) noting that it's **very** difficult to build and sustain a competitive league for so many games. 

However i do agree there are plenty of problems with the company as well, namely a lack of recent innovation and several misteps engaging their community. I think I'm still bullish on the ""soul"" of the company as a whole and would buy for the long run (assuming OW2 and Diablo review well)",Rayofpain,26,/r/investing/comments/mfq8df/activision_blizzard_dd_short_analysis/gsoycpo/,0.045,0.758,0.196,0.991

240,ATVI," ATVI is not a growth company anymore, which is bearish for any gaming company. This is why their need for $/customer is so high. Unique player volume decreases, but the radical fandom increases for those who remain. This is a classic problem for companies in any industry. There is a limit to how much existing customers can be swindled. More often this a problem for pyramid schemes. All of the companies under the Activision umbrella have been leaning on bots to pad their numbers fraudulently. The house of cards will fall with greater reporting requirements. The group of companies amount to cooking books to appease shareholders, and rereleasing IPs to appease an ever aging and ever dwindling playerbase. My guess is that the opposition to shorting would mainly come from the same ones paying to fake the books.

I had a position in them for a while in the past. But sold out. I just think they’re stock is too overvalued right now. I’d love to buy back in if it was cheap again. 

Sure, they’re criticized to high hell, but any triple A game maker is going to be. You talk about EA quite a lot, and people have absolutely gone insane against them for multiple reasons.

You present several statements that raise certain questions.  For example:

1. ""Its PE ratio is similar to EA.""  It's trading at 15x book value... Why should I invest in EA or Activision if I can find a dozen or so companies that are trading at a significant discount?  You invoke the Graham/Buffett concept ""margin of safety"" but DCF analysis puts  its fair value between $71 and $78 per share.  That's the opposite of margin of safety.
2. ""has no intangible assets"" ... No? What's the $1.8 billion in accumulated intangible amortization?  You can't amortize assets you don't have.
3. ""Strong balance sheet""... what was the $18 million unrealized loss in Q3 of 2020 due to?
4. How about the $6.8 billion in Goodwill?  That's an intangible asset.  What acquisitions are related to this and if they're still carrying this value, why would it be better for them to spend the $8 billion on more acquisitions than stock repurchases given that:
5. "" but the most cash that sits in the asset is due to debt issuance.""  Is it?  I see $11 billion in APIC.  Again: In these economically uncertain times, why would more acquisitions be better than share repurchases?
6. ""Cash Flow, company generates a stream of cash which is good.""  What's the $194 million write down of AR in Q4 2020?  There's a quarterly carrying value around $83 million as a provision for doubtful accounts.  What's the connection between these two items and why could its resurgence to 2017 levels present a material impairment to their business, particularly under current economic conditions?

What concerns me is that you approach the analysis from the Graham angle of value and margin of safety, yet present no discussion of the indicators of the same.

252,IRR," There a few factors that would lead me to suggest you adjust your allocation obtain a higher equity allocation relative to bonds. 

First, if you're targeting early retirement you will have a higher contribution rate than a typical person. With a higher contribution rate you will obtain more of a benefit in IRR when prices dip than someone with a lower contribution rate. Essentially, the larger dips in prices associated with equities will be less significant relative to your contributions to the account making it easier to take on more risk during your accumulation phase. 

Second, target date funds tend to be too conservative. Last year Vanguard published research showing that the median target date fund had significantly higher bond allocation than either professionally directed account or self directed accounts as function of age. 

There are several options for shifting to higher equity allocation:

* Keep the target date but allocate a portion to 100% equity funds. Good option because your core account will still get the diversification and auto rebalancing benefits of the target date fund. 

* Choose a target date fund with a later year with lower bond allocation. I don't really like this option because you still don't have direct control over your allocation. 

* Move to a do it yourself portfolio allocation approach.",big_deal,1,/r/investing/comments/mfxkdq/target_date_funds_for_early_retirement/gsqd8j8/,0.042,0.899,0.058,0.5355
