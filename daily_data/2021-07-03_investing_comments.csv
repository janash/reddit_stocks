0,DD," I weep for people who obviously dedicate hours of every week, maybe even every day, making their DD ""analysis"" posts. Hundreds of books on the topic and everyone trying to beat the market, however so few ever do. You are better off setting it in an index fund and forgetting it. All of this analysis you see is a bunch of garbage made so that people think they are smart by investing in some obscure stock.

You can invest in industries you believe in, sure, but going super in depth on everything to do with a company has proven time and time again to have little return on investment. What you want is something that will consistently make you money over the long run and not a guessing game.

I'm not saying you shouldn't do any DD but I am saying that if you are thinking of investing in a company you've never heard of because you think it's gonna be the next big hit you're doing it wrong. Invest in good companies. Look at their balance sheets, revenue trends, etc.",JubilantFire,2,/r/investing/comments/od49oj/how_much_time_should_i_spend_learningresearching/h3y9moq/,0.034,0.881,0.085,0.8225

2,BE," 1. Be REALLY careful with the market right now. There is a lot more evidence pointing to a significant downturn in the market than there is evidence pointing to the market getting better. It's a good time to wait and educate yourself, in my opinion. Especially because, if the market drops a lot, it's an excellent time to buy and make a lot of profit
2. Papertrade with TOS for a while. Treat it like it's real money though or you won't get much out of it. People papertrade like they're millionaires then try to trade a $1,000 portfolio. Very different on a lot of levels. I cannot suggest papertrading more strongly. TOS is an excellent way to papertrade. You learn by doing.

There will always be a stock market. There will always be a hot, new, hyped investment that can make a big return for you.

Try to turn a profit for 3-6 months. Think of this time as learning time.

3) Decide if you want to be an investor (long term holds for years), a trader (shorter term holds, 1-2 years max), a swing trader (trades made daily/weekly), a day trader (trade all day every day).

If you picked day trader then don't do that. Day trading has an incredible fail rate and the people who fail lose everything.

4) Learn about what the market is doing overall. Research macroeconomics. So many people don't pay attention to this and get wrecked. If the whole market goes down 20%, it doesn't matter if you have a company you love that's going to be profitable eventually - it will still drop. There are some really helpful things to understand when you look at macroeconomics. What affects the economy here and all over the world. It's powerful stuff. If the whole market is moving in one direction and you don't know why, you're missing knowledge that's key.

5) Decide what sectors of the economy you want to invest in. Most new traders invest in things they know or hear about (Apple, Tesla, Amazon, Google) but don't think about it. All those companies are basically in one sector of the economy - tech. If that's all you've invested in, you don't have diversification. If you know that a whole sector of the economy is doing well, then you know you have an edge investing in that sector.

Research the kind of stocks you want to get into. Index funds. ETFs. Small-cap. Large-cap. Dividend.

Research specific companies to see what the market is predicting about them, how their finances are, their earnings and sales.

6) Keep doing what you're doing. Researching from lots of sources that are specific to the kind of trading, sector and companies you're interested in. BE VERY CAREFUL with you you trust as a source of information. YT is clogged with people claiming to be good with no proof (or their proof is that they made a bunch of money in 2020 - which anyone could have done).

Personally the best way to invest is to find a company or industry you are passionate about….ie you love playing Xbox, drinking soda, running, or facetiming your friends….now invest in the comany that does that thing…ie MSFT, KO or PEP, NKE or UA, and APPL. Hold for as long as you can.

Looking at his pension plan dividend income portfolio other than some of the banks, pipeline and utility most of the stocks are value/growth stocks and pay less than 1-2% dividends. I would guess the overall dividend yield on the portfolio is around 2%. I would imagine the bulk of the growth generated in the portfolio is due to capital appreciation ie MSFT, V, AAPL, DIS. I really don't distinguish the difference between a MSFT & GOOG just because MSFT pays a 0.81% dividend... To me these are both growth stocks.

55,USA," First of all, VUG and VTV are just two halves of VOO, and VTV is actually outperforming VUG right now.

You see ""Growth"" and ""Value"" have nothing to do with the likelihood of an ETF to grow.   Instead, it's talking about what type of companies it holds.   Growth stocks are young stocks that generally have a ticker price that is more related to future potential than actual book value (new, young, growing companies).   Value stocks are older, often pay dividends, and the ticker price is much more in line with the book value (companies which are a better value to buy).

Value stocks have, over a long period, outperformed growth stocks as far as actual growth goes.   So it's actually over the long term statistically better to hold value stocks than growth stocks.   The problem for many new investors is that we've just ended a period where growth has dominated, and just started a period where value is dominating.   So if you look at the 10-year performance, you'll see VUG way outperforming VTV.    If you went back to 2010 and looked at the 10-year performance for the 2000s you'd find that VTV was the winner for that period.

So, right now, you are earning less money than if you held more VTV than VUG.   This is the problem with the strategy you're trying to execute.  It's really hard to tell which ETFs will outperform at any given time period.   You can look backward and see what has performed well recently, but you can't tell what is going to perform well going forward.  And anyone who claims they know for certain whether value or growth will perform better over the next week or month or year or 10 years is not being honest.   

Because of this property of not knowing which will perform best in the future, it's almost always best to just hold the broad market fund, especially if you're holding for a very long term.   This strategy results in you holding both at the same time, so regardless of what is performing best you'll still be trucking along.

For this, VTI is my preferred weapon which holds all of VOO, plus all of the remaining US stocks as well.  That way you not only get the large companies but the medium and small-sized ones as well.  Then I add a bunch of VXUS which lets me diversify internationally.   Between VTI and VXUS you pretty much hold all of the publically traded stocks in the entire world.   Some people just prefer VT, but there are reasons why I feel that VTI+VXUS is a better choice for me.

The other general recommendation for long-term investing is to not hold individual stocks, or if you do it should be less than 10% of your portfolio.   What happens when Visa ends up losing an antitrust lawsuit? (Yes, the government is investigating them right now.)   What happens when Tim Cook retires from apple in the next few years and his successor runs it into the ground? What happens when Snap runs out of money since it isn't yet profitable and there is no guarantee that it ever will be?

I'm not saying that any of those things will happen to those stocks.   What I am saying is that having 44.57% of your holdings in these 3 individual stocks is far riskier than I think you realize. 

A far better strategy is generally going to be something like 54% VTI, 36% VXUS, and 10% split however you want among the individual stocks.   Note that the VTI/VXUS is roughly at market cap weighting which means that all of the stocks end up with an equal ownership percentage.  If you'd prefer to tilt a bit toward the USA, then something like 60/30/10 or 70/20/10 would work too...",Pass_Little,10,/r/investing/comments/octncl/am_i_on_the_right_track_as_a_new_long_term/h3wibr9/,0.042,0.822,0.136,0.9957

62,BLIN," I know, but for example. Idk how to explain it, but I saw BLIN yesterday when it was at 6.5. I saw the stock had potential because I've traded stocks in its price range for so long. I saw the way it was spiking and pulling back (it's characteristics). I've seen this so much and I called it before it became a top runner (I saw ridiculous volume and potential as it was nearing its high). It also consolidated nicely I felt after it's huge run up and it was just waiting to explode I felt and I entered a position. As it would turn out, it would become one of the main plays for the day. See, this is what I mean. The only thing I used when I entered the trade was it's daily high and low, I also kept vwap in mind (even though I truly don't know what it means from a practicality/actual sense, just that if said stock is above it, then it's good and that it's one of the most used indicators out their.) I usually see if candle lows and highs and VWAP meet. Then I can determine a stocks support and resistance. 

Let's say a stock is at $6.5. It touches 6.45 three times and touches 6.32 4 times on the 1 min chart in. And VWAP is at 6.3. Just like that I would know that 6.3 is a crucial hold for the stock as it's a whole number(perhaps a physiological one too.) and all that.

I use volume (which is really cruddy on power etrade. I really don't even know how it's meant to display volume underneath the charts).
And if volume is hard to read, I could periodically check on volume on the top right corner of any stock and check each candles volume.

I always trade top gainers more often then not, so they're really volatile. I just feel like I'm not doing enough, does that make sense?

78,AMC," Thanks for the suggestions on the sources.  I am glad to hear your approach to making these types of decisions. 

This is a portfolio that is entirely bonus income, so I am not relying on it for retirement, etc. Still, I did substantial research before deciding I like these companies. For instance, I am looking at the number of hedge funds who are long on the stock, what company insiders are doing regarding selling or buying shares, and reviewing the blogs I mentioned. 

I mean, I find red flags with the research I do with other meme stocks, so Tesla, GME, AMC, PLTR, BB are not options.  Red flags were harder to find with these stocks.

82,MMT," I was going to comment for you to read about fractional reserves as well. 

Fraction reserves + federal reserve & you have what you are looking for.

Money as we know it doesn't actually exist, it's debt from the start with an interest rate. With MMT type thinking that interest rate creates the imperative to do something 'productive' for humans with it and gradual new money in the system creates incentive not  to hoard cash because it is losing its value from inflation.

You could call it a lie but it's not hidden. The illuminati symbol is on the dollar bill you know!",CashEMRGNC,2,/r/investing/comments/octej5/is_the_global_banking_system_based_on_a_lie/h3wjaqh/,0.034,0.85,0.117,0.7043
83,RH, A good example is The central clearing house made RH put up around $3 billion during the game stop frenzy to cover the heightened risk of the trading going on especially with their easily acquired margin trading and is why they had to halt some trading. That’s also why they are being fined around $70M.,7__aTe__9,0,/r/investing/comments/octej5/is_the_global_banking_system_based_on_a_lie/h3whied/,0.108,0.801,0.091,-0.0094
