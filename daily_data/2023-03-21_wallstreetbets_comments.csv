Annual cicadas' life cycles are staggered and some emerge each year. Periodical cicadas emerge in synchronous cycles and thus emerge en mass at approximately the same time. Probably due mostly to geographical differences in soil temperatures (and therefore development rates, as the insects are ectothermic), periodical cicadas in the USA tend to emerge in 17 year cycles in more northern states, and in 13 year cycles in the South.",FLnat,13,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/11xfr3x/the_original_when_to_make_money_bro_from_the_1800s/jd45xl6/,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

Issue is FDIC didn’t have $143 billion in assets if all of those depositors wanted their cash. So FDIC needed a backstop for worst case scenario. 

It’s been out out there in the PR, the FDIC expects real losses to be $2.5 billion for Signature. They’ll likely expect a higher number for SVB.

32,OP," No, but it's more complicated than that and OP doesn't understand what the FDIC did here so I'll explain it. We're getting worked up over an accounting maneuver, basically.

SVB, at the end of 2021, bought a ton of longer term bonds. When rates shot up, those bonds lost relative value on the secondary market. If played out to maturity, or if the Fed didn't juice up the treasury market by executing one of the fastest rate tightening maneuvers in recent history, those bonds would have been fine.

Instead, they lost marginal speculative value... again, totally fine, until a bunch of VCs realize that you're vulnerable to a capital underrun attack, and tell their clients that **\*they all put in your bank\*** to withdraw their money all at once.

This causes a bank run. Since those highly concentrated funds are against a mix of loans with questionable terms negotiated by VC backers all given to unprofitable tech startups, corporate real estate, and lower-interest bonds, the bank had to tap its bonds to try to get cash for customers, trying to arrange for a sale at a loss.

This wouldn't have worked, and so the FDIC stepped in and took over the bank.

In order to cover deposits, since the value is in these assets, the FDIC has to loan out cash to cover the bank run. They are arranging for the sale of the assets and covering some of the excess.

The actual difference will be the amount leftover once all assets are sold, and most of them will be sold at a more ideal value than SVB would have gotten because the FDIC and the Fed are in a better position to apportion them. The rest will be paid off by other banks, either through demands for capital from the FDIC, or through money taken in by the new Fed bond loan-out facility returns.

Basically, no, the Fed didn't print money and the banks will ultimately pay the cost.",Moist_Lunch_5075,68,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/11x0vfi/the_fed_only_had_128_billion_in_fdic_insurance/jd0wdrp/,0.067,0.833,0.099,0.8883

You can get 125 grain VMAX cooking at 2,000 FPS for deer hunting, 180 - 220 grain lead @ 1,000 FPS for 45ACP like ballistics, and when shot subsonic through a suppressor, the only noise you hear is the action of the weapon cycling. 300 BLK burns all of its powder in the first 9” of the barrel, so it’s a special forces wet dream. Couple that with all that’s needed to convert a traditional AR is a barrel swap (and possibly buffer weight with a barrel shorter than 9”) and mags, if you don’t already have Surefeed magazines kicking around.

ETA: Ammunition can be made by cutting 1x fired 5.56 brass at the shoulder (@ 1.38”) and sourcing 7.62 projectiles & running through the proper die.

But  FRC equity is DEAD. Donzo. Gone. The bank had $70b in deposits flee in 7  days. Over 40% of their deposit base. The losses on asset liquidation  on their residential and loan portfolios are GREATER than the equity  value that exists prior to the deposit flow outs.

Not  to mention that the bank had to borrow over $110b at 5% interest rates.  That is greater than the entire 2022 YE revenue for interest payments  alone.

Assuming that there is ANY  deal, the equity value - like that of SVB, Signature, Wamu, CS and  hundreds of others - will be almost completely taken out. Some bank is  going to buy this for $1 who has the actual cash on hand to take their  underwater portfolio through to redemption.

If  you're buying this to see it back at $140 or even $50 it will not be  happening anytime soon and IF this bank survives, it won't happen for  years.

191,TX," my personal belief is that AT1 are not worth the risk, because the outcome can be brutal, with a total loss.  lets face it, any institution that needs to issue AT1's has a solvency issue to begin with, and even though your analysis shows what appears to be a decent cushion, we also know that when things go bad in banks (and are they really ""banks""?), the numbers are huge and the regulators make the call. and i would not rely upon the credit agencies whatsoever.

if one is looking for yield, there are lots of oppty in revenue muni bonds (say TX or FLA) and no taxes will be paid on the interest - also there are quite a few preferreds out there that will get you 7% to 8% on cost, as many preferreds today are beat down.  And there are even some plain old common stocks out there will yield, such as VZ. in the normal bond market you can finds some deals, for example if you believe QVC is viable, the YTM seems like a decent risk/reward - i tend to avoid preferreds and bonds in energy entities, unless they are the big names.",pnw_sunny,11,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/11wvwm9/deutsche_bank_default_up_next_inconsistency_with/jd02afq/,0.076,0.84,0.084,0.1484

BUT, if you could orchestrate, somehow, for all of the free deposits in the entire system to come to you to lend at the now higher rates of 7% while everyone else is cash poor and locked in with their 2.5%, youre going to be the only one in town to have those fat net interest margins. Hell some banks have a net interest expense as they pay 4.5% to try to keep capital and loaned at half that. 

I think - what a time it would be to start a bank with all new cash instead of it all locked up in shit mortgages. Well, JPM has taken in the equivalent of 10 regional banks of deposits in 2 weeks. They inadvertently stripped all these deposits from rival banks, leaving behind the shitty loans, and now get to start anew with higher rates.

But FRC equity is DEAD. Donzo. Gone. The bank had $70b in deposits flee in 7 days. Over 40% of their deposit base. The losses on asset liquidation on their residential and loan portfolios are GREATER than the equity value that exists prior to the deposit flow outs. 

Not to mention that the bank had to borrow over $110b at 5% interest rates. That is greater than the entire 2022 YE revenue for interest payments alone.

579,NIM," I think you misunderstand the term risk-free rate, it only means that your return of capital plus interest is guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.  It doesn't mean that you are magically immune to the risk of fluctuating interest rates.  Some, but not all banks are going down for unmanaged duration risk.

Bridgewater is the biggest hedge fund, it is not the most successful as measured by long term returns.  You are correct in that most hedge funds quit being strictly market hedging operations decades ago though some still employ traditional long-short beta smoothing strategies.  Bridgewater's customers demand alpha, sometimes that is achieved by collecting pennies over the risk-free rate, beats getting hammered in a market downturn.

Not everyone, nor their mother, knows how to hedge duration risk at scale.  It would involve interest rate swaps, derivatives, collateralized borrowing, asset-liability alignment.  SVB did not have a chief risk officer from April 2022 to January 2023 to oversee such non-trivial operations.  Other banks knew how to hedge but hedging costs money and it would compress their NIM which would hurt their share price so they decided to roll the dice betting that a terminal fed funds rate would not cause an extinction event.",SeemoarAlpha,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/11xjhh4/the_biggest_banking_crisis_of_us_history_ray/jd4tgdx/,0.097,0.831,0.071,-0.7866

>TL;DR: The crypto boys are going to get rekt, Powell is going to raise rates by 25bps, QQQ is going to fall, NVDA and MSFT are overvalued, yields are going to continue to rise, energy is a good hedge against inflation and stagflation is coming.",VisualMod,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/11xpdk1/what_is_about_to_happen/jd43sft/,0.0,0.872,0.128,0.8611
585,ID," I bailed out of em last year. The stickier the markets got the weirder things got as far as deposits, withdrawals, puts, restricting my trade over ID again and again... caused me to panic and realise some bad losses just to get away.",PilgrimOz,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/11wvuns/cant_short_nu_stock_on_etoro/jd01g11/,0.269,0.731,0.0,-0.9118
586,OP," OP you have 2 options:

1: Give me all your money.

2: Get shoot.

That's how easy you make a a fake pool by limiting option that would be less insane.

Also this is robbery OP that wasn't a joke 🔫",grimkhor,6,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/11xu3mi/whats_your_view/jd4t1jj/,0.224,0.709,0.066,-0.7091

592,GM," I guess more or so how any money is made on some trades. Like with my current GM spread, i got a credit of $31 initially, but it cost me $70 to enter the spread. Does the spread make the $70 back as it decays? Making total profit from the trade $111?",Inevitable_Ad_6008,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/11wxwhk/how_do_you_profit_from_bull_put_spreads/jd4sivu/,0.063,0.799,0.138,0.4956
593,TXN," Outside of some companies in China, TXN seems to be the only major analog semiconductor supplier expanding capacity - their competition is scared of that much capex.   It will put them at a huge advantage in the coming years when  semiconductor demand sees another spike.

598,CAC," I don’t understand how it can be profitable. Maybe I need to understand LTV of a Robinhood user but I can’t imagine it’s anywhere near the APY they pay above they’re banking partners’ APY (assuming the banks don’t pay out the full 4.15%). CAC seems too high. If they get a small percent of one cent per trade for PFOF, how can a retail trader account(s) be that valuable to them",Hotsauce716,0,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/11x8b5u/robinhood_gold/jd1wa0s/,0.046,0.868,0.087,0.5994
