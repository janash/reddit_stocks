11,BP," They should have seen it coming and not come so close to a margin call, yeah. But this childish understanding of what happened is so annoying. They didn‚Äôt want to halt trading and create the biggest PR disaster since the BP oil spill. They failed to prepare or message about it appropriately. It was either halt increasing the position size in the volatile stocks (which would require even more cash on hand) or have ‚Äòtechnical difficulties‚Äô and bring the entire platform down, like I kind of suspected they did during the pandemic crash volatility days. (Also like other firms did on gme volatility day? Idk but it is curious that platforms always go down on high volatility days. They say it is volume.)

The big failure was they pulled in extra cash to shore up maintenance for the volatility spike way too late. This wasn‚Äôt a conspiracy to fuck customers, like the hordes of brand new ~~investors~~ cultists think. It was a failure to see what was happening and a mismanaged PR disaster. The bigger question is why hasn‚Äôt vlad‚Äôs head rolled yet? I suppose there‚Äôs nobody to replace him at this stage.

Good luck with that Vlad, people will just poach it for more fuck up sound bytes, while they willfully refuse to understand what happened and smear shit on their faces while crying about holding amc and gme until they reach some magical number where they become the richest people in the world.

23,GME," I fear major pushback for this comment because reddit HATES robinhood after what happened but maybe /u/WickedSensitiveCrew (OP) would like a real answer about who is really to blame. 

The online brokerages are at the mercy of the clearing houses that they work with. Once you buy or sell a trade it takes a few days to settle. The clearing houses are responsible for that process and they require **collateral** in the meantime. 

In the week that GME went to the moon, the clearing houses raised their **normal collateral** required from the normal 2-3% allllll the way up to 100%, but only for Gamestop and a few other names. Kind of a big increase....wouldn't you say? And kind of fishy timing....wouldn't you also say? Was that Robinhoods fault? No, no it was not. 


Most brokerages, even the big ones, couldn't put up 100% so they turned off buying for those equities...they simply had no other choice. 

What Robinhood is guilty of is not communicating this fact to their customers....they basically put out a bunch of bullshit about how it's in the best interest of their customers. They also didn't want to give the appearance that they were having liquidity problems once the requirements were raised from 3% to 100% but of COURSE they were. 

Further complicating these factors was the incredibly large percentage of wall st bets people who used Robinhood at the time. Other brokerages were able to turn back on GME buying quicker despite the new requirements because they had fewer shares of GME to worry about. 

If reddit understood the role of [the DTCC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depository_Trust_%26_Clearing_Corporation) in all of this they would be the real villain, not Robinhood. They are just a humble company with 2.3 TRILLION dollars of equity that most people have never heard of....and which is backed by the biggest financial names in the world. No big deal....I'm sure they are nice people who welcome the internet taking out hedge funds. Nothing to see here. Let's get back to hating a goofy app for stock trading....

67,GME," So many young retail investors literally think it's some sort of video game like Animal Crossing's Stalk Market. 

The moment people take a step back to realize that stocks are not magically pulled out of thin air to keep the ""game mechanics"" working but rather they're literally an actual asset held by a broker somewhere in the world is when more of this starts making sense. 

Millions at once joined in to try to rush to the gold of GME, and all wanted to buy the exact same shares at the exact same time, while many weren't selling because the price was skyrocketing. It was such a pure example of the laws of supply and demand happening *fast.* Brokers restricted trading on it because there literally wasn't enough supply. Combine it with a ton of brand new retail traders blindly throwing out market orders, it was the perfect storm to make a brand new retail trader who made millions in the ""Stalk Market"" think it was rigged.

I legitimately saw what seemed like serious questions about how Animal Crossings figured it out and Wall Street didn't and jumped right to ""rigged.""",yarrr0123,7,/r/stocks/comments/n2ihgo/why_hasnt_robinhood_still_not_received_any_form/gwk8pxa/,0.049,0.872,0.08,0.8047

That plus security. The dude is essentially running the publicly traded version of the NSA.

192,TMO," A lot of comments here are recommending biotech sector which is certainly poised to grow in the next decade. I personally have money in TMO (Thermo fisher Scientific) because I think they are a solid company in the long term. It would be tough to find a lab anywhere that did not overwhelmingly use TMO products. These products range from simple molecular biology reagents to extremely expensive state of the art instrumentation such as mass spectrometers that need expensive service contracts. The only thing TMO lost out on was sequencing where their ion torrent platform simply could not compete with illumina. 

The TMO play in my opinion is to cash in from the general growth of the biotech industry. For example, the recent covid test is run on the kingfisher flex platform and this alone is a $65k instrument. They provide solutions such as sequencing prep kits too which I have used previously. Literally anything you need to do in a lab related to molecular biology, TMO will have a kit or product that will help.

TLDR: TMO is like a biotech walmart. Products are not cheap, but labs will still purchase them. I personally use their products everyday (in previous jobs and present)

Edit: Thank you for the award! My first ever. Bonus points for TMO - The 65k instrument that mentioned used for covid testing can also be used for many other types of workflows. This instrument was on back order when we tried to order some a few months ago. Another great feature about the numbers is the healthy PE ratio in the current market (around 30) and also pays a dividend.

Edit 2. The products offered are of vast variety. I will list them in as logical of a fashion as I possibly can. You can buy lab supplies (test tubes, micro centrifuge tubes, etc), instrumentation such as centrifuges, refrigerators, PCR cyclers, plate readers (fluorescence, uv, etc), microscopes, flow cytometers, lab automation equipment (such as kingfisher platform) and this instrumentation list can go on. 

On a biologicals side you can buy antibodies against various proteins of interest, fluorescent markers, click chemistry reagents, pcr cycling master mixes, you can custom synthesize DNA strands, peptide sequences, buy linkers to be able to hybridize antibodies to DNA strands if required (as drug delivery systems). 

You want to insert a gene into a plasmid and then express that protein in mammalian cell culture using an adenoviral vector? Sure, they have all the required kits to be able to do that and the instrumentation that is required to go with the entire workflow. 

You want to buy an orbi trap mass spec instrument because you want to study post translational modifications on proteins? They got you covered.

Point is, this is a good company and will grow with the industry. The list of products is way too large for me to type out but they've got you covered. Literally mostly anything you want to do in a molecular biology lab",Nosemyfart,13,/r/stocks/comments/n2705g/best_sector_for_the_next_5_years/gwhypuc/,0.015,0.881,0.104,0.9911
193,STEM," Local energy storage, played via STEM.  There's lots of EV players and lots of companies messing around with rewewable-based electrical generation.  But for renewables to truly take over, collection and storage is necessary.  STEM is the far-and-away leader.  

Same with EV's.  Our electric grid can't even handle warm days or cold snaps without choking, and even the current infrastructure plan won't change that reality.  We've driven the wheels off it.  It's done.  

Right now, when the workday ends, people get home and demand 2,000 watts each, which stresses the grid to the brink.

Now realize that in an EV world, when people get home, they'll demand 12,000 watts, comprised of their usual 2,000 watts, plus an extra 10,000 watts for charging their cars overnight.  

People are absolutely, undeniably, going to have to make and store their own electricity if the dream of EV's in every garage is going to happen.

296,AAPL," >I don't like the idea of a defensive portfolio having heavy weightings >= 5% on 5 individual stocks. That adds a lot of beta for what kind of return? A hope that these individual stocks will outperform the market?

APPL and MSFT may outperform, will likely match, may underperform but slightly.  I find it unlikely that they will tank, and near impossible that they will tank (independently from the market) before I'm able to get out in time.

Tobacco stocks are simply for the dividend.  In terms of appreciation they will likely underperform or could even result in losses, which is something I need to be vigilant about.  The dividend, however, outperforms pretty much any other fixed income at the moment.  These companies are sound and not going anywhere anytime soon, except perhaps Imperial Brands, which I will need to keep an eye on.

>The going wisdom right now is to be overweight on international as a defensive stance. Intl stocks have far better ratios on P/E, forward P/E and P/B. VXUS is great. A small dash of frontier could be good as well.

Do you have a source for that?  I mean, I understand the part about P/E ratios, etc. But I also understand that the Fed is pumping up asset prices, and IMO, if you can't beat 'em, join 'em.  In a way riding the wave *is* a defensive play.  I would absolutely not go 100% on it though, that's loco.

>If I were running a high concentration of individual stocks in a defensive portfolio, I can't imagine stocks like AAPL and MSFT being the top picks (of megacap growth, they have some of the worst P/E and P/Bs, even though they are very fairly priced IMO. But GOOG and FB are both far superior picks). I would rather take below NAV SPACs for the high optionality and asymmetric upside if I were very insistent on capital preservation. If capital preservation isn't the primary goal, then why not just 100% index funds or a mix of index + individual growth stocks (your AAPLs, MSFTs etc) and ride out volatility for long term returns?

I bought MSFT and AAPL because I understand the companies and their products.   GOOG and FB are kind of mysteries to me, and frankly, GOOG is out of my price range and my brokerage doesn't offer fractional shares.

I wouldn't say capital preservation is my primary goal.  But it's one goal.  I think between total risk-on and total defensiveness there is a middle ground.  I tried to capture something of the best of both worlds here, although I imagine I'm leaning more towards risk-on with this allocation.  Still, less risk-on than 100% equities.

Honestly, I see a lot of uncertainty in the future.  Coming out of Covid, global warming, geopolitics.

APPL and MSFT may outperform, will likely match, may underperform but slightly.  I find it unlikely that they will tank, and near impossible that they will tank (independently from the market) before I'm able to get out in time.

Tobacco stocks are simply for the dividend.  In terms of appreciation they will likely underperform or could even result in losses, which is something I need to be vigilant about.  The dividend, however, outperforms pretty much any other fixed income at the moment.  These companies are sound and not going anywhere anytime soon, except perhaps Imperial Brands, which I will need to keep an eye on.

I think the panic related to the menthol news was just general panic about ""omg smoking is done forever"".  It's my understanding that people have been saying that for decades, yet here we are.  All of the tobacco stocks have since recovered since last week's nosedive.

310,PM," You can reference my initial research [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/loygiq/why_i_just_went_long_on_big_tobacco/) where I show that smoking rates around the world are holding steady or actually increasing.  That is not the trend in the US or Europe, but in the developing world it is.  Smoking will be around for another 30 years or so at a minimum.

You're also forgetting transitions into next-generation products like heat-not-burn, vaping, nicotine pouches, and cannabis.  PM had a wonderful Q1 thanks to growth in their heat-not-burn category.

>For instance, how did the raise of the age requirement to 21 affect sales? I recently read that a country was going to ban the sale of cigarettes? Can't find anything on it atm and am kind of in a pinch, but this legislation is not unheard of.

It didn't much, since my companies are all international players.  I do not own the only company that only sells in the US (Altria Group).  I have not heard anything about a country totally banning cigarettes.  The worst I've heard is Australia who has high taxes and plain packaging.

>""good business no matter what is happening"" seems grossly negligent to me long term.

I don't think it's negligent, I've done the research.  Most investors and institutions seem to want to stay away because of moral reasons and/or the notion that there are better returns in other industries, which is true.  However, as a defensive play I don't see it as a bad move at all.  These companies are grossly undervalued when you look at their revenue streams and dividend yields, and that's even more appealing considering just how inflated everything else looks.

If there's a huge crackdown in the next 10 years then it might be worth reevaluating, but people have been saying ""this is the end"" for decades and tobacco companies are still some of the biggest and most profitable around.  Your concerns are valid but I do not see belief in these investments as negligent in any way except from a moral standpoint (if you're into that).

311,IMO," Your concerns are very valid!  It's definitely not a 30 year hold no matter what.  It's a re-evaluate every 5-10 years IMO.  But with *potential* to be a 30-40 year play.   Their customers are very loyal, after all!

I just like tobacco.  I used to smoke several years ago and I'm very glad I quit and don't feel like ever touching it again.  But psychologically I still enjoy something about the idea of it.  Maybe a dumb reason to invest.  But at the same time, if I'm  kind of hooked like that then imagine the people who are actually smoking 'em still.  You could also argue that since I understand the product and enjoy doing the research that there's an information advantage there.  Something like DraftKings is just booooring to me.  But that's just me.

314,ICE," I definitely agree with your sentiment.  Many people don't even realize the electric version just means changing the complex ICE engine and supporting parts for... complex electric motor(s) and supporting parts.  

The bet on some is that they'll individually benefit from the transition.  Let's consider Ford.  They are now in the position of year-plus waiting lists, when they've traditionally been unable to give their cars away.  On top of that, they're on a new trajectory of being more selective about where and what they sell, with profit being the driving factor.  They've ruthlessly abandoned the unprofitable markets.  

Their one successful product line has been pickup trucks, because they can price them at double the MSRP of cars even though they don't cost that much more to make.  Making the trucks electric has allowed them to jack up the price premium even higher.  CEO just claimed it gives the truck more power ( which I'd like to see data on) and versatility, citing examples of Ford truck owners who used the onboard generators during the blackouts.  

Ford is also getting some business producing electric cargo vans and things they otherwise wouldn't.  

There's also the assumption that EV sales will incorporate greasy and greedy software and subscription revenues.  Like the way Tesla makes owners pay thousands to remove the software block on seat heaters.  Or the way Ford already makes owners pay for the maps and linkage to your phone.  It's an assumption that this lucrative scheme will expand.

All that said, everyone is making a case why their favorite car company will be the one that gets all these boosts, but they can't all win.  At some point there will have to be a shakeout or rationalization.",Summebride,1,/r/stocks/comments/n2n4gh/soon_all_car_manufacturers_are_going_to_be/gwkzdje/,0.05,0.87,0.08,0.6114
315,TSLA," VW has a room to grow because they are recovering from deiselgate, they went heavy into electric, cutting almost all forms of motorsport they were involved in (a lot of r&d is done there). They have the biggest factories in the world so possibly can reach economies of scale faster. EVs are still expensive, but if they can offer a good range at the same cost as current cars, they will be set for the future. 

At least that's my thinking behind VW anyway.

I also think the EV push is coming at the same time as the 'smart tech' push in the car world, thanks to Tesla I suppose. It's the next market tech companies are looking at, and thinking of getting involved, could be a lot of potential. Doesn't just have to be auto driving. With EV cars charging might take 30mins+ so there's a whole avenue of things a car didn't need to do before that could be added for comfort, and 'smartness'.

That's why I've invested in VW and TSLA. Not sure about the others I only feel strongly towards these two brands.",TODO_getLife,1,/r/stocks/comments/n2n4gh/soon_all_car_manufacturers_are_going_to_be/gwl3qp4/,0.019,0.886,0.095,0.9397

319,ICE," Glad someone else here is saying it.  

There's this huge misperception that science and manufacturers have quietly invented new and magic battery capabilities.  They haven't.  There's actually been no noteworthy progress at all.  People just told themselves ten years ago ""oh science and industry will make rapid progress"" and then they closed their eyes, woke up today and assumed it must have all happened.  Except it hasn't.  

Batteries become useless at cold temperatures, and will self destruct if not kept warm. Tesla uses the battery's own juice to run electric heaters to keep itself warm overnight.  If that runs out, it uses the last of the power to send a flag to Tesla that you've been careless with your battery and voids your warranty.  That's not innovation.  

We're in the honeymoon phase where everyone is enjoying their EV's first battery.  But unlike ICE engines, batteries age and die whether you use them or not.  Replacing a battery will be a costly headache.  Those people you know enjoying their 20 year old Toyota, Honda, or Ford truck that's on its first power train?  EV batteries can't do that.  And those 20 year old workhorses with the original engine?  They've had to replace the battery five times along the way.  No amount of pampering and preventive maintenance can avoid the fact that batteries eat themselves to death.

And the other huge point you didn't mention is that our electric grid has no ability to support EV's.  Expecting every home and parking lot to suddenly support 5000-10,000 watts of simultaneously overnight charging is a pipe dream.  Our grid already falls apart on warm days or cold nights.  

The unspoken Achilles heel of EV's is that electric system upgrades will be required BEFORE EV's can see mass adoption.  

And since I know our infrastructure can't/won't be rebuilt for that, I'm better that individual power generation (solar/wind) and (especially) storage will be required first.  Essentially I'm saying that those who want a garage with two EV's will need to add some cogeneration and energy storage.  

That's why I'm investing in STEM for the long term.  

And for the short term, my opinion on battery technology (above) is why I'm investing in Micro-Vast.  They're sort of the Walmart of EV batteries, but the auto industry is going to be demanding tons of regular, non-futuristic batteries immediately, and they're well poised for that.

And the other huge point you didn't mention is that our electric grid has no ability to support EV's.  Expecting every home and parking lot to suddenly support 5000-10,000 watts of simultaneously overnight charging is a pipe dream.  Our grid already falls apart on warm days or cold nights.  

The unspoken Achilles heel of EV's is that electric system upgrades will be required BEFORE EV's can see mass adoption.  

And since I know our infrastructure can't/won't be rebuilt for that, I'm better that individual power generation (solar/wind) and (especially) storage will be required first.  Essentially I'm saying that those who want a garage with two EV's will need to add some cogeneration and energy storage.  

That's why I'm investing in STEM for the long term.  

And for the short term, my opinion on battery technology (above) is why I'm investing in Micro-Vast.  They're sort of the Walmart of EV batteries, but the auto industry is going to be demanding tons of regular, non-futuristic batteries immediately, and they're well poised for that.

Until I went and looked in the indenture, and this paper is structured in a way that I'd never really thought about or encountered, since it seems like it functions like a call option with no premium (note holders can convert to equity at their discretion any time over the next six years) but in the legal vehicle similar to a SPAC (if you don't exercise the call option available to buy shares at the current strike price - or in the case of a SPAC, the committed capital isn't deployed via deSPAC merger + IPO - the original notional amount is returned to the public share holders / PIPE entities).

>**In connection with the pricing of the notes, Snap plans to enter into capped call transactions with one or more of the initial purchasers of the notes** or their respective affiliates or other financial institutions, collectively, the capped call counterparties. **The capped call transactions will cover, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments substantially similar to those applicable to the notes, the number of shares of Snap Class A common stock that will initially underlie the notes.

This lends the impression that this transaction is part of a broader M&A process. I suspect the private buyers of the convertible notes are an M&A target SNAP is looking to scoop up, but instead of further diluting their current shareholders now by issuing new stock to the target, it appears they're delaying that for some time by issuing the converts and effectively deferring the increase to their cost of capital down the road until if/when the notes are exercised and equity is issued.

As for SNAP's viability going forward, despite debt and lack of profit, many people may not realize there's been a major shift with respect to SNAP that kicked in about six months ago. 

Before that they were regarded as just another money-losing fad that would go away.

They were considered a fad of being the disappearing messages app.  They re-invented to do filters, which continue to be inexplicably popular.  They've re-invented to do stories.  They're re-inventing now as group messaging, which is hot, and experiential, which is perfect for the now rebounding travel advertising segment.  It's becoming harder to bet on SNAP just fading away as had always been assumed.  

SNAP is also considered one of the less harmful type of social media and tech plays.  Where FB is considered pure evil, SNAP is considered benign.  Turns out that's good if you want to sell advertising.  

During this earnings season, SNAP weathered it about the best, compared to peers like FB and PINS.   Maybe next week will be SNAP's turn to get beat down, but so far, so good.",Summebride,1,/r/stocks/comments/n2nmdi/when_we_look_back_at_this_era_one_of_the_talking/gwl876l/,0.048,0.752,0.2,0.9963

355,AAPL," I've taken up dividend investing in the past few months, here's what I know so far:

1) if you hold a share before the ex-dividend date, you are eligible to get a dividend payout from that stock

2) dividends come from the company's profits- they are removed from the stock price, but not covered as a loss. So in your example (simplifying down to owning 1 share) of you have a share that is $27, that pays out 68 cents a share, you end up with a share that costs $26.32, and 68 cents off free spending money, and your brokerage shouldn't be showing that position in the red.

3) there are 5 types of dividend payout; weekly, monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, and annually. They pay out 52, 12, 4, 2, and 1 time per year, respectively.
These can happen at any date/day.

4) the strategy you described to but, qualify, then sell is a used tactic, but it's not really sustainable. There's several videos on it and it's problems. Because a lower price leads to more shares being scooped up, the share price tends to bounce back after dividend payment, so it's usually a better strategy just to hold onto your investment until you hear news that gives you an indication to sell.

5) look for companies in the dividend aristocrats/ kings list; companies like T, VZ, MO, KMB, XOM, O, MAIN, AFL, and CVX have 4-7% dividend yields, while also increasing their dividend payout so the longer you hold a position the more it makes for you.

Side advice: Don't chase yield, chase companies with stability that have a history of increasing dividends at a high rate. I'd rather have $1000 in AAPL than $1000 in a company with a 14% yield that'll crash in a month. The only accepting to that are a few ETFs out there that do covered calls, they're very stable and barely change in value, but pay out roughly 10-12%, they're not growth companies but they do pay monthly and can be good compounders; QYLD and RYLD are the 2 I'm invested in.

Of course, make sure to do your own research and only buy into companies you like.

the ""beta"" is a measure of the ups & downs of the market as a whole, or a section/fund/stock/subset. the market as a whole has a beta of about 1 -- you'll get this from an S&P 500 fund or total market index. (https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VTI?p=VTI&.tsrc=fin-srch) beta below 1 is less volatile, beta above 1 is more volatile than the market as a whole.

another plus is that low-vol funds also lean towards value stocks from big established stable companies, and are more likely to pay dividends.

428,CS," I feel like you‚Äôre missing something fundamental here. 

> Stock A is currently at $100

This means that the last time a trade was filled, it was for $100. Usually a stock price is a last price, or the most recent amount of money per share that happened on the exchanges. 

> if an order for 1000 shares is filled at $100, does this do anything to the share price?

No, it was filled for $100 meaning the most recent amount of money per share that happened on the exchanges was $100 per share. Unless you‚Äôre talking average fill. 

When you submit a buy order, your brokerage (whatever system they use) will try to find all sellers that match your needs. Sell order finds buyers. 

In your solo participant market, if you tried to buy something there would be no sellers... since you‚Äôre the only participant. So you wouldn‚Äôt get your order filled, sell or buy. 

This is true of any market, whether for stocks, pencils, or CS GO skins.

well yes, did you come to this conclusion when you heard the fed say we're under their goals for inflation and theyll take steps to hit those goals?

or for interest rates, when they said they expect to raise them as things return to normal?

neither means a crash will or will not occur

Youve basically said nothing of value here. Markets always are near / at ATH, fed aims for a moderate amount of inflation as that makes debt favorable and interest rates are tied to inflation and move as part of how they handle inflation.

442,AI," I think there is a lot of status quo bias here. It is easy to see that Buffett has lost his edge because his fund is too big. Apple, et al, have similar issues, their next idea has too be huge or it does do enough to keep them on top, they must eat more snd more market share or implode with their growth focus, and a few bad ideas, or even no new good ideas could cause a cascading effect.

Will Google‚Äôs AI pay off huge, or forever be a few years away; will Facebook be on top of the next trend, or bring us the next beta max; will Amazon‚Äôs increasingly unreliable ratings, predatory practices snd poor public relations drive us to the millions of competitors that are here and/or coming - focussed on niche markets snd a better experience?

The problem with success is that it demands more success. Large utilities or telecoms have massive entry barriers, but disruptive tech is difficult in conception but the barrier to entry is lower everyday.

My kids are just as happy watching teenagers play with dolls on YouTube as they are watching cartoons; and YouTube is not necessary to that equation. 

I think it‚Äôs a good question, all technologies have at their core their own extinction; they push us further but there is always some aspect that is lacking. Have the big players become too large to pivot and too bureaucratic to innovate? 

For my money, I think Apple has. Phone sales (number of units) has fallen while prices rise, innovation has stalled, brand is waning as others catch up, and without something new to capture the imagine become a ‚Äúdad‚Äù or ‚Äúmom‚Äù product rather than cool.

465,SLB," A month or two ago I would have said you‚Äôd be really safe riding with CAPL - but it‚Äôs gone up quite a bit already. I think there are still some really solid values that pay nice dividends in energy right now. Keep an eye on that sector - SLB seems undervalued in the mid-term, for example. EPD is widely considered to be one of the best managed companies around, and they pay a consistent dividend to boot. CNX is a domestic natural gas producer to monitor, too. Earnings were great, and they have room to grow. 

I think TSM at 117 is an absolute steal given your profile. That is a very fair price for them, and analysts agree it‚Äôs likely an undervalued stock. 

Lockheed at 380 is still a good deal, too. They pay a dividend and have a proven track record with room to grow on top of their current valuation.

CAG (Conagra Foods) pays a divvy and could grow 10% without much of a push, and have weathered COVID gracefully. Recently upgraded by Morningstar and not without reason. One of the last undervalued food sector stocks left, IMO.

If you want a true big-brain play, buy a uranium ETF - URNM - on the next 3/4 day drop. Buy some shares in Energy Fuels (UUUU) too. In two years, I think you will be very happy. Short-term could be choppy.

476,SO," This time next year, the market will be down 20%.  

Think about that, 20%! 

You are going to lose 20% of your money.

Are you ok with that?

But it may gain 30 in 2years.

SO that's 10% gain in 2 years.  5% per year is good.

HOWEVER

If you try to time the market, you will never do that good.  You will miss the 5 days of huge gains that make up a big chunk of the gains.

So if you don't need the money for a few years, put it into total market funds such as VTI, VOO or VT.",LegendLarrynumero1,-1,/r/stocks/comments/n2hg4j/im_disillusioned_with_the_market_as_a_whole_any/gwkay1q/,0.031,0.735,0.233,0.9781

479,AI," Newsflash - no day trader consistently makes money - not by ""learning"" as you ask in your question.  None.  Now people can get lucky and some can get really lucky for a long period of time.  That's just statistically expected.  Some get lucky and some don't (look up normal curve in statistics and variance).  But to think anyone here can consistently beat the market consistently by day trading is ludicrous.  There are literally hundreds or more likely thousand of phds and then thousands more MBAs working at mega investment firms across the world with access to immense amount of data that you and I could never get, have super computers that identify the slightest discrepancies or changes in volume, sentiment, spreads, etc and look for arbitrage opportunities and use AI and complex algorithms and BTW also have connections in the industry and politicians that can tip them off for any possible winds of change and you think some Joe Schmo sitting at home in his underwear looking at his $1,000 lap top screen by looking at charts using his ""technical analysis"" is going to beat them?  GTFO.

Now this is different than medium to long term investing.  People can consistently make money doing that.  

But as it relates to day trading?  The WSB guys have it right.  It's a casino.",Fear51,23,/r/stocks/comments/n2bcpf/for_anybody_successful_in_day_trading_how_long/gwigmtt/,0.04,0.909,0.051,0.1508
