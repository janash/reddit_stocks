104,DD," This is all just from my observations so I could be talking out of my ass but:
- Dunkin doesn't appear to make their actual donuts on site. I don't notice them ""going"" stale because they're already stale at the window. On the plus hand it doesn't matter what time of day I go they're about the same level of freshness.
- This means they are likely more profitable than Krispy Kreme because they don't have deal with the cost of making donuts on site fresh. Don't sell them all? I'm pretty damn sure the DDs I go to save them for the next day. 
- DDs are goddamn everywhere and I think they're all franchises (I mean licensed, not actually owned and operated by the company) so corporate can ensure they make a profit off of licenses fees and selling supplies to franchise owners. If the place is unprofitable, the owner takes the hit not DD. 
-Actual owners are stingy with everything to save money. The one closest to me will give you zero napkins with your donuts unless you specifically ask. If you ask they give you like 2-3. I can't imagine what else they're doing to cut costs if napkins are an issue. 
- KK lines are always long and slow in my experience. I'm not stopping at KK on my way to work unless I'm leaving early and making a whole trip of it because there's not that many of them.

964,DD," /u/Pendigan

I work within distribution to mass retailers (Target, etc.) and also wanted to provide some insight to your DD. I think it's great DD and I will likely be looking for a position on this company:

* Be careful when evaluating demand based on empty shelves. Currently retail, and specifically mass retail is having a tough time with supply chains both import and domestic. Longer lead times to orders from the point they leave domestic vendors to when they flow through DC's and onto store shelves are making replenishment timelines tough. It doesn't mean it hasn't sold well, but it could also mean they haven't gotten replen in fast enough.
* The $32 per SKU per store metric could be good or bad if we have some additional info on when this metric was taken and when they launched in store. Target has about 1800 stores, but not all products launch to all stores. It's fairly common to see a few hundred stores for specialty products or testing, around 700-800 products for high velocity stores, in the 1100-1200 range to include medium velocity stores, and up to 1800 for all doors. Given their price was around $5 each that would be about 6-7 units per sku per store since launch. If we're talking a couple months the average of 1.0 UPSPW (units per store per week) is pretty good overall (I will disclaimer this that I don't know as much about the grocery metrics as I work in other product categories). If we're talking a couple weeks or less that's awesome.
* Marketing! I trolled Linkedin and noticed on their ""People"" section here: [https://www.linkedin.com/company/tattooedchef/people/](https://www.linkedin.com/company/tattooedchef/people/) that they have a Director of Digital Strategy. The Kicker is that she just started there in April of this year. So we can assume with a normal timeline in place that they will be building out strategy, designing, and launching campaigns on social media (she has experience in) and other areas soon. They're not currently hiring any other marketing people from what I saw so they shouldn't need to wait for additional support to begin.
* Target Stores - another point on this, if they do succeed well and are not in all stores yet, it isn't uncommon to be expanded into more stores. However, this would need to happen during a set change timing. Whether that is during a major set like Spring or Fall, or during a minor revision in between could happen, but they need to fit space on the shelf for more product to come in, which means during some form of product change timing. And to ramp up to that takes supply chain production increasing, so there has to be ample time from seeing sales data to being able to deliver product.

&#x200B;

Overall - that was the points I felt I could provide additionally, but happy to answer more questions. I like this after just reading through your DD and will be doing some additional research.

973,DD," I was coming here to say something along the same lines. Empty shelves don't mean a thing right now other than they didn't get restocked.

I appreciate all the work that went into this DD, and I didn't read all of it, but this feels like too much hype. Almost like hype from an insider. Where did the Walmart sales info come from?

I really can't help but poke holes in some of this overly enthusiastic DD. The graphic says 200k sq ft of manufacturing space. That's a pretty good size production facility, but probably just one. Or maybe two medium sized facilities. That sure didn't sound like ""vertically integrated"".

Additionally, vertically integrated doesn't necessarily mean immune to inflation. Inflation right now and forecasted for the food industry isn't because suppliers are getting greedy, it's labor shortages, production capacity limitations, environmental factors, etc. Being vertically integrated just means that the suppliers' headwinds are your headwinds, too. It can cut out a lot of costs, but it can also trap a company into a lot of fixed costs that they might not have otherwise. You expect me to believe that they're sourcing tomatoes from Italy, but also that they are vertically integrated? They own the pomodori fields in Italy? Sounds expensive. I've been there. I've seen how ""insurance companies"" operate there. And even with vertical integration, the food industry operates on thin margins. I don't see this being the Tesla of the food industry.

As far as expanding outside of frozen, that's going to either take serious build out or acquisition. Not that I don't think they can do that, but the costs of integrating an acquired company are significant and they often drag on for a significant amount of time, could be years. Acquisition means taking on additional marketing teams, R&D teams, QA teams, warehousing, etc, and then you have to trim the fat. Build out means you have to build those teams from the ground up. A factory that makes frozen meals is not going to also do bottles sauces. Likewise with R&D teams.

This really doesn't feel industry disrupting either. So it's plant based meals. These aren't cutting edge science meat analogues. These don't look like they are trying to mimic whole muscle chicken made from pea protein or something like that. They're making good, veggie-based meals. It's not something that someone else can't come in and do. Other than branding, there's not much stopping anyone else from coming in and doing their private label version of these.

The fact is, you don't need to be right about the results of an announcement to push the value of a stock and profit from it. The speculation of WKHS being given a contract is enough to bump the price in the short term and could lead to a higher price-point consolidation. Look at Viac which jumped in price today purely from speculation of a potential Comcast merger which was solely based on rumors and not a news piece nor announcement.    

And if WKHS does in fact get some new contracts as a direct result of the infrastructure announcements, the stock price and options values of holders will quite literally grow exponentially given that WKHS has THE highest SI rate of any stock in the market and is one of the most discussed/trending stocks in media right now .

1234,TLRY," I won't argue with your WSB yolo, but TLRY and the Canadian LP's have nearly no shot at out performing the US MSO's fundamentally. They don't have the capital to scale or acquire an MSO because their balance sheet is so bad. The best they could do is maybe acquire a microcap MSO. If they did M&A in early 2020, it would've been great, but they would have lost their listing status. The Canadians are a trade while the Americans are an investment. LP's are in an unfortunate position because they are listed on the US exchanges, but because of that, they are locked out of actually selling THC in the US. 

Just FYI, Europe is kind of like USA back when California first legalized a decade + ago. Unless they really expedite the legalization process, it will take some time. So US markets are a good 3-5 year outlook while Europe will be good 5-15 years. Curaleaf is also in Europe. 

Speaking of Curaleaf, they made more revenue than CGC/SNDL/APHA in 2020 COMBINED. They also have less market cap than just CGC.

1245,TLRY," It's not speculation that the big 4 MSO's are spitting out cash flow like no one's business. As growth companies even. If WSB wants to pump TLRY, go ahead, but fundamentally it does not even compare with the MSO's. It's just like you say, the only shot that TLRY, or any other LP have of building a solid footprint in the US is by way of a share offering on a fundamentally overpriced stock. If they can take advantage of their listing status, they may be able to skyrocket and gain enough cash through offerings to try and obtain a tier 2 or 3 MSO. They don't have a shot at a tier 1 MSO because the market caps are too close now. Again, TLRY could have a short term rip on any US legislature, but eventually, the markets will vote for the fundamentally stronger companies. Unfortunately, that appears to be the US MSO's as they are fundamentally outperforming the LP's even though their own gov't won't allow them to list on their native exchange, their own gov't forces them to do cash only transactions and doesn't allow them access to banking, AND their own gov't taxes them 2x what is normally taxed for a business (280E). In spite of the gov't hindering their business, the MSO's are thriving. Trulieve and Green Thumb are EPS POSITIVE as growth companies! That's incredible. They pay double the taxes of a regular company. Cresco and Curlaleaf aren't far behind either. All four that I mentioned are EBITDA positive and cash flow positive. The balance sheets are fat and healthy for the next M&A deal.",kingkongy,0,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o9we2s/why_weed_tlry_dd/h3eb64u/,0.05,0.799,0.151,0.9863
1246,CPG," Weed isn't expensive to grow in the right environment. As you say, geography is a definitely a factor and that's why certain MSO's invest in California, at the expense of their own margin profile. They learn how to efficiently grow in a mature market and they learn techniques of growing where it is difficult.  I think that the US will have their own best interest in mind when implementing federal legislation. Why would the US just allow companies to grow across borders and import it? It doesn't make sense, especially considering how corrupt these politicians are. I think that grown in American plant will dominate American sales. I even think that the US will try to stick to a States model, where states govern the plant grown in their own borders. We're at a major point in the industry where the States model might try to shift to a federal model, so I can't opine as to what will happen, but I believe the States model is much better for our MSO investments. Federal model won't be great for margins. Wholesale will probably be better in the long run for the Federal model. Think Herr's or Utz CPG for weed. Right now, the MSO's are in purgatory trying to figure out whether to focus on wholesale or retail. The better performing MSO's like Green thumb and Trulieve are more retail focused while the MSO's with lower margins like Cresco and Curaleaf are risking their margin profile to focus on wholesale and establish a national brand.",kingkongy,6,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o9we2s/why_weed_tlry_dd/h3ecaxo/,0.048,0.819,0.133,0.9649
1247,TLRY," Well Said. That‚Äôs why I like TLRY better. 

And once legalization does happen who is to say that US won‚Äôt be saturated just like it happened in Canada? With lower margin cannabis sold as competition intensifies ? At least we know TLRY is the leader in market share in Canada. They competed with 800 LPs in the market and have survived.

It‚Äôs just like natural selection. Put the best products in the market customers tend to gravitate towards the best ones. If MSOS is gonna have Nokia type branding or products than even if TLRY is late they can get a good chunk of that share. Products #matter quality #matters.

1299,WKHS," From [investopedia.com](https://investopedia.com): What Is a Put? A put is an options contract that gives the owner the right, but not the obligation, to sell a certain amount of the underlying asset, at a set price within a specific time. The buyer of a put option believes that the underlying stock will drop below the exercise price before the expiration date.

&#x200B;

Now is the part where I am going to give my completely uninformed theory as to what could possibly happen; I am a complete non-professional and don't know what I'm talking about.

WKHS is currently selling higher than the put contract gives them the right to sell for, so there is no point in using the put contract to sell right now. But, let's say they all sell their WKHS shares which drives the price below the put contract price. Now, they can suddenly buy more WKHS shares and sell it for a higher price using the put contract. Again, I don't know what I'm talking about. Someone else should probably give a more legit answer.",Catheldrin,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oac8k2/lots_of_puts_to_expire_worthless_wkhs/h3gnnea/,0.033,0.902,0.065,0.6863
1300,WKHS," By design the Lordstown Endurance and the WKHS NGDV are built on the same skateboard. 

Since Oshkosh did their own testing on a vehicle not yet built, WKHS has a good chance. 

From a business standpoint, outside of the USPS, they‚Äôre projecting a near break even this year

Here‚Äôs some info on the company. But definitely check out their webpage.

1307,JMP," Here is why I am in sofi long term. Side note I have never owned a meme stock. 

1. Jamie (jmp) recently came out and spoke about how he thinks companies like sofi are a serious threat especially in the near-ish future and regrets not taking the threat seriously. Wouldn‚Äôt be shocked if JMP got aggressive in buying up one one of these see their purchase today. 

2. They don‚Äôt just have a well known backer and spac leader they have well known and proven CEO who manages the day to day. 

3. Most of what they offer has exploded in the past 24 months look at Morgan Stanley‚Äôs increase in trading revenue. 

4. Even if interest rates rise in 2 years that actually helps them. 

5. I will admit I think their current market cap is too high but I‚Äôm always too cautious when it comes to that there are other companies within insane market caps with less or no future.",Tribebro,9,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oaepan/sofi_yolo_17721_shares_all_in/h3h4rrh/,0.114,0.816,0.07,-0.753

SENS why to buy

Catalyst 

SENS CGM system has been remodeled and improved to last 180 days, and is awaiting approval from the FDA. The chances of it being approved are high considering that it‚Äôs already being used In Europe. Keep in mind America makes up about 96% of the market share. Due to Covid-19 the approval was pushed back and is thought to be some time around the middle of this year.

This has caught the eye of institutional buyers as 25% of the stock and 50% of the float is held by institutional buyers. Recently, H.C. Wainwright agreed to buy about 25,974,026 shares at 1.925 per share. Within days the same Hedge Fund agreed to increase the magnitude of their purchase to 51,948,052 shares at the same price. The total value of the purchase is exactly 100 million dollars. Then on January 21st, it was bought deal valuing the total purchase at 115 million

SENS has 14 patents all relating to the design and specific parts of their CGM system

The way a normal CGM system works is a tiny sensor with a needle is inserted under your skin and then it measures your glucose levels while lasting up to 7-14 days. Twice a day you need to check the CGM system itself by pricking your finger and inserting a drop of blood. You also need to replace the CGM sensor every 3-7 days which requires you to remove the entire device. 

The Percentage of Americans with type 1 diabetes that use a CGM is now on an exponential growth curve rising from 12% in 2014 to 24% in 2016 to 38% in 2018 

The general market concentration has about 4 major players
Dexcom, Abbott, Medtronic, and Senseonics. So this market is extremely concentrated

Out of all the other companies that are solely devoted to the design and manufacturing of CgM devices there are 26 competitors , however Senseonics has received the most funding at 143.4 million.

Also the main subject behind the majority of their patents is analytical chemistry, analytical chemistry is the science of obtaining, processing, and communicating information about the composition and structure of matter. In other words, it is the art and science of determining what matter is and how much of it exists.

And while yes this field is being used to separate and measure the glucose levels within the human Body, this field is very wide and offers a wide selection of possible futures, once revenue increases. 



Out of the past 4 quarters SENS has beat revenue expectations 3 times and beat EPS estimates twice.

MARKET DRIVERS

Surge in diabetic population
-205.47 million people suffer from diabetes in China and India
-20 million had type 1 diabetes
****
America:
-2.7 million Americans have type 1 diabetes 
-32.3 million Americans have type 2 diabetes
-Diabetics have a 300% increased risk of being hospitalized, thus increasing expenses or cautionary measures
-In developed countries close to 90% of type 1 diabetes patients use glucose meters, 50% of type 2 may also use glucose meters

With increasing awareness among the type 2 diabetes patients, demand for CGM devices has been rising at a rapid pace 

In 2016 there were about 321 million people with diabetes, by 2020 the number has increased about ten percent to 361 million. 

2017 Increased 2.18 percent 
2018 Increased 3.96 percent 
2019 Increased 2.93 percent 
2020 Increased 2.84 percent 



SENSORS
Eversense CGM System, an implantable glucose sensor by Senseonics Incorporated was launched in 2018. The advantage of Eversense CGM System is that it can remain in place for up to three months, where the other CGMs sensors remain in place for up to 3-10 days.

MARKET SEGMENT
Medical devices occupied 27.7% of the share in 2020

Between 2018 and 2020, Senseonic generated a meager $8.3 million in product revenue. It cannot manage to break even in terms of gross margin. Since its inception in 1996, the company has lost $648.5 million. Before its $175 million equity infusion in Q1 2021, the company had just $35.9 million in assets to offset $177.2 million in liabilities.
Possible downsides: 
Its peers, such as Abbott Laboratories (NYSE: ABT), Dexcom, and Medtronic (NYSE: MDT), are all better capitalized and farther ahead in their technology. By the time Senseonic launches Eversense 365, its competitors will likely have moved on to seventh or eighth-generation CGMs. It's typically not a good idea to go long on stocks of a healthcare company that can only play catch-up. 


Summary: As an investor I typically like to follow Socially Responsible Investing/ Value Investing. Looking at the companies free cash flow/ ebitda ratio shows that they are in a good position to grow, along with pending FDA approval for their 180 day CGM device. Also considering majority of diabetics have said they would prefer this over the dexcomm CGM device it shows promise. Overall I believe SENS can have great enterprise value and wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see it trading around 30 dollars EOY. 


Disclaimer: Normally I Buy a stock within 10-15% of a 52 week low that‚Äôs shown itself to offer some price support. If in this case it breaks to a new low, cut losses.
Also look into rare birds, asset plays, to a lesser extent, arbitrage opportunities and companies selling at less than two thirds of net value (net working capital less liabilities). So I am breaking my usual buying pattern.

1701,ASO," So the supply shortage is actually hurting their firearm sales right now. They noted that on their earnings call and clarified that firearms/ammo are not driving their overall sales growth (the 10-Q actually noted a decrease in firearm sales).

HOWEVER, they have also reported a double digit increase in margins. Management said that the increased margin is being driven by ‚Äúmerchandise‚Äù. That‚Äôs a very broad category and it happens to include firearms. So it‚Äôs entirely possible that firearm sales are driving the increased margins even if they aren‚Äôt driving sales growth. If that is the case, it will eventually come to light in the coming quarters. I personally don‚Äôt believe that increased firearm margins could account for even half the overall margin increase but time will tell. For now, Management seems to be taking advantage of the better margins by paying down debt.

As for the current price, I‚Äôm not sure really sure why the price being at an all time high is relevant here.

Also last year, around March, when EV & SPACS were blowing up, HYLN did move and I made some money off it but ever since then, any momentum within the EV and other related markets has been generally dismissed by the stock. 

Sure there are some upward movements but I personally think my money is better invested in other opportunities with faster and more predictable returns.
