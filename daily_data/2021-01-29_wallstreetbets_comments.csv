128,GME," Get ready for FUD (Fear Uncertainty Doubt) campaigns on the weekend. It's already starting.

The number of posts with supposed ""level headed"" advice about how a short squeeze is much more difficult to achieve than we all think and how the strong and powerful hedge funds have much more cards up their sleeve and to ""rethink your strategy"" but still ""Go GME I am one of you guys!"" always with a few rewards sticked to them is exploding and will be getting progressively worse in the weekend most certainly.

Hedge Fund interns have now learned how reddit works and want to part you with your GME shares.

ALWAYS check the up / downvote ratio and read the comments before getting swayed by whatever semi correct sounding bullshit they're spouting. Oh how desperate they now have become.

163,A," A lot of you are asking the importance of closing above 320. Here's why it's (likely) important:

As you witnessed in the last half hour, almost every time we climbed up, we'd be brought back down at the same speed. We experienced a ""ladder attack"" which, to oversimplify it, is these companies selling shares at lower prices and buying shares at lower prices to force the price down. But they're doing this at like insane speeds. 

320 was a major point of resistance for us. We kept getting beat down from there for a while, which makes us assume their ladder was designed to knock us below 320, perhaps even knock us below 300 if our resolve hadn't been so strong. With the market closing above 320, they now have to excercize the expiring options that are profitable up to, and including, the 320 range. They wanted to do what they could to avoid that as to limit their losses. I'm not looking at advanced charts or anything rn, but I'm assuming there must have been a sizable amount of weeklies/FDs that they're now forced to pay out, in addition to every other single option from 320 (330? I forget where we closed lol) and below. 

This is a HUUUUGE dent, and I'd be shocked if we didn't open above 500 on monday.

SHORT LADDER ATTACK INCOMING HOLD HOLD HOLD BUY BUY BUY

UPVOTE AND SHARE

In the last hour of trading some of us are predicting they will launch a short ladder attack to make it look like it’s selling off to trick you into selling your shares. Their goal is to go under $115 to get out of their expiring contracts. This will be a major victory for them.

Hedge funds sell back and forth with one another at lower and lower bids in rapid succession, tricking algorithms into thinking there is a mass sell off when there actually isn’t. (They do this to scare off retail investors to engineer a sell off). Once the attack is over, the stock will normally go back up due to its demand. Then they will rinse and repeat their attack, each time hoping to chip away more and more retail investors. Most people in here know this, so if retail investors are selling, it’s unlikely that it’s anyone at all.

**$GAMR is an ETF with** [**143,205 shares of $GME stock**](https://etfmg.com/funds/gamr/) **THAT HAS NO LIMIT ON ROBINHOOD**

An ETF or Exchange Traded Fund is a basket of securities that trade on an exchange just like a stock.

ETFs can contain all types of investments including stocks, commodities, or bonds. Basically if $GME crashes $GAMR is still worth something at the end of the day because the investment is spread across other securities. Its an investment in an investment.

**You're not adding to the $GME pump, but this is a way to ride the gravy train.** **When Robinhood reopens sell this shit and pump it into $GME**. But this lets you at least take part if you're late

Yesterday GME closed at 195 due to the same tactic. Aftermarket it went right back up to about 300/share due to demand. 

It will most likely do the same tonight. We may finally see our short squeeze come Monday. Or another gamma squeeze.

Hijacking this spread the word:

**$GAMR is an ETF with** [**143,205 shares of $GME stock**](https://etfmg.com/funds/gamr/) **THAT HAS NO LIMIT ON ROBINHOOD**

For those that dont understand:

An ETF or Exchange Traded Fund is a basket of securities that trade on an exchange just like a stock.

ETFs can contain all types of investments including stocks, commodities, or bonds. Basically if $GME crashes $GAMR is still worth something at the end of the day because the investment is spread across other securities. Its an investment in an investment.

You're not adding to the $GME pump, but this is a way to ride the gravy train. When Robinhood reopens $GME sell this shit and pump it into $GME. But this lets you at least take part if you're late

SHORT LADDER ATTACK INCOMING HOLD HOLD HOLD BUY BUY BUY

UPVOTE AND SHARE

In the last hour of trading some of us are predicting they will launch a short ladder attack to make it look like it’s selling off to trick you into selling your shares. Their goal is to go under $115 to get out of their expiring contracts. This will be a major victory for them.

Hedge funds sell back and forth with one another at lower and lower bids in rapid succession, tricking algorithms into thinking there is a mass sell off when there actually isn’t. (They do this to scare off retail investors to engineer a sell off). Once the attack is over, the stock will normally go back up due to its demand. Then they will rinse and repeat their attack, each time hoping to chip away more and more retail investors. Most people in here know this, so if retail investors are selling, it’s unlikely that it’s anyone at all.

UPVOTE AND SHARE

In the last hour of trading some of us are predicting they will launch a short ladder attack to make it look like it’s selling off to trick you into selling your shares. Their goal is to go under $115 to get out of their expiring contracts. This will be a major victory for them.

Hedge funds sell back and forth with one another at lower and lower bids in rapid succession, tricking algorithms into thinking there is a mass sell off when there actually isn’t. (They do this to scare off retail investors to engineer a sell off). Once the attack is over, the stock will normally go back up due to its demand. Then they will rinse and repeat their attack, each time hoping to chip away more and more retail investors. Most people in here know this, so if retail investors are selling, it’s unlikely that it’s anyone at all.

I'm sure some of them can. But the number of shares they need to deliver is massive and volume after hours is usually small. It would actually drive up the price faster, unless there's a counterparty willing to dump massively after hours (which would likely be significantly less profitable for the counterparty than during normal hours).

> Can the ITM call holders continue to switch between exercise and hold vs exercise and sell?

The decision to exercise (by the holder of the option, not the seller) has a deadine of 5:30 PM. The price is set at the close of 4:00 PM.

SHORT LADDER ATTACK INCOMING HOLD HOLD HOLD UP VOTE AND SHARE

In the last hour of trading some of us are predicting they will launch a short ladder attack to make it look like it’s selling off to trick you into selling your shares. Their goal is to go under $115 to get out of their expiring contracts. This will be a major victory for them.

Hedge funds sell back and forth with one another at lower and lower bids in rapid succession, tricking algorithms into thinking there is a mass sell off when there actually isn’t. (They do this to scare off retail investors to engineer a sell off). Once the attack is over, the stock will normally go back up due to its demand. Then they will rinse and repeat their attack, each time hoping to chip away more and more retail investors. Most people in here know this, so if retail investors are selling, it’s unlikely that it’s anyone at all.

ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS HOLD HOLD HOLD! DON'T GET PAPER HANDS DURING THE LAST HOUR, ITS WHAT THEY WANT!

GET RID OF THE STOP LOSSES, THEY WILL TRY HUNT THEM

It's possible the ladder attack at the end of day yesterday was just a trial run for today. They held the price where they wanted it (around 227) for ages, and then with just one ladder attack got it to 197 which had two effects:

1.	⁠⁠Caused a volatility halt at 15:59:41 - so we had no chance to get it back over 200 in those remaining 19 seconds 2) Made sure the EOD price was under 200

I think today there is a chance that they won't go for 150, 115 or 100, but just take the guarantee of hitting under 200. Take a beating over a killing.

They will want it resting on around 227 and then time their attack to sneak it just under 200 with the halt in place to see out the clock. So if it is ~227+ with under 10 mins to go, we know what they will do. And those few minutes before it could be crucial.

846,GME," TLDR: The short squeeze might happen if you hold, however if you hold there is a chance that nothing really is going to happen and the stock is going to stay at the current price for a couple weeks while the hedgefunds slowly cover their positions without raising the price too much.

💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎

Retail investors dont have centralized control therefore is hard to coordinate the holding, its a big prisoners dilema.

I believe that hedgefunds have smelled the blood on the water and have started buying positions in GME to squeeze the short themselves. Paper handed investors who need the money in the short term are in to get their accounts destroyed.

Near-term i believe not much is going to happen as hedgefunds have enough solvency to outlive the frenzy (since they dont have to cover their positions as long as they can pay the short premiums). Whoever talked about gamma squeeze happening today doesnt really know about delta-hedging. No brokerage is going to allow naked puts in a volatile market right now so there was literally 0 chance that a gamma squeeze was going to happen today. Specially after the media frenzy i believe most risk management will be overly cautious about this situation since is ""The little guys"" vs ""The big guys"".

Medium term (within the next month). you might potentially see the real squeeze as other hedge funds consolidate long positions and are able to hold large portions of stock against the shorters.

However there is the possibility since volume is so absurdly high that short interest will drop substantially in the near term and what you will see is just a drawn out squeeze where the stock price is going to stay at current levels for a week or two and then drop back down without any major jumps upward.

Reddits weakness is the lack of centralized decision making which makes this a huge game of chicken.

864,GME," So, if institutional investors want to punish the retail investors they need to do it in a way that the retail investors have trouble countering.

In most cases, they would try to get the strike to where a majority of the open options positions would expire just under the strike with the most interest to keep people from having them executed and making money (in this case, the target would be <$320)

But my theory is, since there is a huge short interest, it's better for the big players to let GME finish above 320 which causes the largest open interest (300, 320) to all get auto-exercised.

Most retail traders don't know how to prevent the auto-exercise, so this causes a bunch of people to buy the stock at 300 and 320 (and various other strikes, under the 325 closing price)

Then they short the price down hard and buy to cover at the lower price in after-hours market, which has much less exposure to the retail investors. Right now the price is down to ~300. 

This allows them to gain a profit of ~$20 right now on the execution of those 320s and potentially more, if the price continues to drop.

If the price actually tanks well below 300, this will additionally trigger margin calls Monday morning on the people assigned the shares at 320 and generate maximum profit for the short sellers.

It's too early to determine if this will happen since it would require a hell of a sell-off, but there is clearly an absolute ton of pressure to lower the price after hours to punish those who were holding 300 and 320 calls.

To give a more concrete example of how to manipulate the price:

HF buys GME when it dipped under $150.

HF sells GME 320 calls after it goes back up, for $$$$

Market pins GME at 325 at expiry, forcing auto assignment of 320s

Instead of allowing the cheap GME to be called away, they force the price down after hours.

They buy shares to cover their short calls at a discount, since they will get $320 for them.



Price was bouncing pretty hard between 300-320, but creeping back over 320 now.

SHORT LADDER ATTACK INCOMING HOLD HOLD HOLD BUY BUY BUY

UPVOTE AND SHARE

In the last hour of trading some of us are predicting they will launch a short ladder attack to make it look like it’s selling off to trick you into selling your shares. Their goal is to go under $115 to get out of their expiring contracts. This will be a major victory for them.

Hedge funds sell back and forth with one another at lower and lower bids in rapid succession, tricking algorithms into thinking there is a mass sell off when there actually isn’t. (They do this to scare off retail investors to engineer a sell off). Once the attack is over, the stock will normally go back up due to its demand. Then they will rinse and repeat their attack, each time hoping to chip away more and more retail investors. Most people in here know this, so if retail investors are selling, it’s unlikely that it’s anyone at all.

How to Buy GME etc \[Loophole\]

Robinhood and other shitty brokerages are allowing us to buy 2, 5, or very low numbers of GME. However, they are allowing option contracts.

Here’s a trick that will work.

1. Go to Feb 5 option.
2. Scroll all the way down the call list
3. Buy GME call option with the cheapest +x.xx%

We united **TENS OF THOUSANDS** of people from more than **54 COUNTRIES** to teach Wall Street a lesson. The people can't be fucked around with. We will take revenge for 2008.

We showed the true colors of Billionaire scum bags. Even making the government involve itself and filing a class action lawsuit all less than **2 DAYS!**

SHORT LADDER ATTACK INCOMING HOLD HOLD HOLD BUY BUY BUY

UPVOTE AND SHARE

In the last hour of trading some of us are predicting they will launch a short ladder attack to make it look like it’s selling off to trick you into selling your shares. Their goal is to go under $115 to get out of their expiring contracts. This will be a major victory for them.

Hedge funds sell back and forth with one another at lower and lower bids in rapid succession, tricking algorithms into thinking there is a mass sell off when there actually isn’t. (They do this to scare off retail investors to engineer a sell off). Once the attack is over, the stock will normally go back up due to its demand. Then they will rinse and repeat their attack, each time hoping to chip away more and more retail investors. Most people in here know this, so if retail investors are selling, it’s unlikely that it’s anyone at all.

SHORT LADDER ATTACK INCOMING HOLD HOLD HOLD BUY BUY BUY

UPVOTE AND SHARE

In the last hour of trading some of us are predicting they will launch a short ladder attack to make it look like it’s selling off to trick you into selling your shares. Their goal is to go under $115 to get out of their expiring contracts. This will be a major victory for them.

Hedge funds sell back and forth with one another at lower and lower bids in rapid succession, tricking algorithms into thinking there is a mass sell off when there actually isn’t. (They do this to scare off retail investors to engineer a sell off). Once the attack is over, the stock will normally go back up due to its demand. Then they will rinse and repeat their attack, each time hoping to chip away more and more retail investors. Most people in here know this, so if retail investors are selling, it’s unlikely that it’s anyone at all.

1182,GME," It means that there are no real shorts left. The short interest in GME is strictly a function of the put volume - there is $18 billion in puts outstanding and $58 billion that traded today alone (now a lot of that will be opening and closing, but still thats a fuckton of puts). When a market maker sells a put, they hedge their delta by selling (or shorting) shares. The short interest in gamestop is strictly a function of the size of the derivatives market at this point and nothing else. Hedge funds actually have to manage risk and have a risk metric called ""value at risk"" or ""VaR"" - this measures the realized volatility in an asset and tells you how much you can lose on a position on the worst days in a rolling time series. Even in very small size, shorting GME blows up VaR because its realizing 50%+ moves a day. No risk manager in the world can be short GME with this size of moves.

1184,A," A stock, like everything else in the world,  is only worth what someone is willing to pay. Fundamentals dont fucking matter.  1. Gamestop would be suicidal to destroy their goodwill now. 2. If they did try to add additional stock,  they would have to have a board meeting and vote. The shareholders would be notified and gamestop would be hit with a minority shareholder suppression and stock dilution lawsuit immediately.  Which would ties the issuance of stock in litigation.

Most just won't support a Chinese-owned company, and that's about it.

How to Buy GME etc [Loophole]

Robinhood and other shitty brokerages are allowing us to buy 2, 5, or very low numbers of GME. However, they are allowing option contracts.

Here’s a trick that will work.

1) Go to Feb 5 option. 2) Scroll all the way down the call list 3) Buy GME call option with the cheapest +x.xx% 4) Immediately exercise.

I just exercised 2 contracts and now have 200 shares, blocking the shorts. You can repeat this process over and over if you are buying a lot.

Best of luck out there! Let’s get them!!!

How to Buy GME etc \[Loophole\]

Robinhood and other shitty brokerages are allowing us to buy 2, 5, or very low numbers of GME. However, they are allowing option contracts.

Here’s a trick that will work.

1. Go to Feb 5 option.
2. Scroll all the way down the call list
3. Buy GME call option with the cheapest +x.xx%
4. Immediately exercise.",0.113,0.887,0.0,-0.7617

SHORT LADDER ATTACK INCOMING HOLD HOLD HOLD UP VOTE AND SHARE

In the last hour of trading some of us are predicting they will launch a short ladder attack to make it look like it’s selling off to trick you into selling your shares. Their goal is to go under $115 to get out of their expiring contracts. This will be a major victory for them.

Hedge funds sell back and forth with one another at lower and lower bids in rapid succession, tricking algorithms into thinking there is a mass sell off when there actually isn’t. (They do this to scare off retail investors to engineer a sell off). Once the attack is over, the stock will normally go back up due to its demand. Then they will rinse and repeat their attack, each time hoping to chip away more and more retail investors. Most people in here know this, so if retail investors are selling, it’s unlikely that it’s anyone at all.

ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS HOLD HOLD HOLD! DON'T GET PAPER HANDS DURING THE LAST HOUR, ITS WHAT THEY WANT!

GET RID OF THE STOP LOSSES, THEY WILL TRY HUNT THEM

It's possible the ladder attack at the end of day yesterday was just a trial run for today. They held the price where they wanted it (around 227) for ages, and then with just one ladder attack got it to 197 which had two effects:

1.	⁠⁠Caused a volatility halt at 15:59:41 - so we had no chance to get it back over 200 in those remaining 19 seconds 2) Made sure the EOD price was under 200

I think today there is a chance that they won't go for 150, 115 or 100, but just take the guarantee of hitting under 200. Take a beating over a killing.

They will want it resting on around 227 and then time their attack to sneak it just under 200 with the halt in place to see out the clock. So if it is ~227+ with under 10 mins to go, we know what they will do. And those few minutes before it could be crucial.

The number of posts with supposed ""level headed"" advice about how a short squeeze is much more difficult to achieve than we all think and how the strong and powerful hedge funds have much more cards up their sleeve and to ""rethink your strategy"" but still ""Go GME!! I am one of you guys!"" always with a few rewards sticked to them is exploding and will be getting progressively worse in the weekend most certainly.

Hedge Fund interns have now learned how reddit works and want to part you with your GME shares.

ALWAYS check the up / downvote ratio and read the comments before getting swayed by whatever semi correct sounding bullshit they're spouting. Oh how desperate they now have become.

1474,RH," I would imagine that brokers should be fairly open for business Monday. If you figure the issue is that Robinhood and others had their funds tied up for the T+2 settlement period, and that volume first hit Wednesday, then those settlements should clear at close of business today or monday morning (however thats calculated), so all the tied up funds from Wednesday (which forced the Thursday shutdown) are off the books then - I think, and RH has the liquidity to execute more trades until they run up against their limit. The bigger problem is the funds they raised yesterday which allowed them to reopen trading today won't clear til Wednesday, so they might have to close trading again on Tuesday unless they come up with more funds.",0.043,0.917,0.039,-0.128

1483,IMO," It's really unlikely that they do (1). I think they'll end up with real riots if that happened again, that was pure illegal market manipulation. If they can't properly cover themselves, that's not our fault and we shouldn't be blamed for it. We like the stock.

IMO, it's either we're going to go through a Tesla squeeze, or have it happen all at once. The supply just isn't there for shorts to even try covering. The stop loss hunting, buy ban, and short ladder attack at once yesterday was the dirtiest they can go but now we know this. Since then, I've been setting low price buy limits in case they try it again so I can profit off their idiocy.

1546,GME," I feel like this was an easy target for shorts. Despite the huge position and possibilities of another gamma, everyone was so focused on GME I think they missed out on a prime buying opportunity. I bought more shares on the dip and had no intention of it being a quick turn around but it still stings a little seeing those big red numbers up there. I bought because I really do like the stock and see it going way up to the mid to upper $100's this year just because of how many pots their cooking in right now.

**I AM EXTREMELY PROUD OF EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU.**

As many of you know there are a hella options contracts that expired today IN THE MONEYYYYY.

How many you asked?

Today the closing price is **$325**

which means there are **41,870** contracts that expired ITM which means there are **4,187,000** shares that need to be covered. and it's true that probably a lot of them are already covered. but this is a significant amount, even a small percentage of these are naked call there is still lots of shares that need to be covered considering that WSB probably holds the majority of available float shares, so DONT SELL YOUR shares and squeeze these shorts into lemonades.

Buy as many shares as you could, because this rocket ship has initiated engine burns, and it's starting the count down for **LIFT OFF** !!!!

UPVOTE AND SHARE

&#x200B;

In the last hour of trading some of us are predicting they will launch a short ladder attack to make it look like it’s selling off to trick you into selling your shares. Their goal is to go under $115 to get out of their expiring contracts. This will be a major victory for them.

&#x200B;

Hedge funds sell back and forth with one another at lower and lower bids in rapid succession, tricking algorithms into thinking there is a mass sell off when there actually isn’t. (They do this to scare off retail investors to engineer a sell off). Once the attack is over, the stock will normally go back up due to its demand. Then they will rinse and repeat their attack, each time hoping to chip away more and more retail investors. Most people in here know this, so if retail investors are selling, it’s unlikely that it’s anyone at all.

SHORT LADDER ATTACK INCOMING HOLD HOLD HOLD BUY BUY BUY

UPVOTE AND SHARE

In the last hour of trading some of us are predicting they will launch a short ladder attack to make it look like it’s selling off to trick you into selling your shares. Their goal is to go under $115 to get out of their expiring contracts. This will be a major victory for them.

Hedge funds sell back and forth with one another at lower and lower bids in rapid succession, tricking algorithms into thinking there is a mass sell off when there actually isn’t. (They do this to scare off retail investors to engineer a sell off). Once the attack is over, the stock will normally go back up due to its demand. Then they will rinse and repeat their attack, each time hoping to chip away more and more retail investors. Most people in here know this, so if retail investors are selling, it’s unlikely that it’s anyone at all.

n the last hour of trading some of us are predicting they will launch a short ladder attack to make it look like it’s selling off to trick you into selling your shares. Their goal is to go under $115 to get out of their expiring contracts. This will be a major victory for them.

Hedge funds sell back and forth with one another at lower and lower bids in rapid succession, tricking algorithms into thinking there is a mass sell off when there actually isn’t. (They do this to scare off retail investors to engineer a sell off). Once the attack is over, the stock will normally go back up due to its demand. Then they will rinse and repeat their attack, each time hoping to chip away more and more retail investors. Most people in here know this, so if retail investors are selling, it’s unlikely that it’s anyone at all.

How to Buy GME etc [Loophole]

Robinhood and other shitty brokerages are allowing us to buy 2, 5, or very low numbers of GME. However, they are allowing option contracts.

Here’s a trick that will work.

1) Go to Feb 5 option. 2) Scroll all the way down the call list 3) Buy GME call option with the cheapest +x.xx% 4) Immediately exercise.

I just exercised 2 contracts and now have 200 shares, blocking the shorts. You can repeat this process over and over if you are buying a lot.

Best of luck out there! Let’s get them!!!

SHORT LADDER ATTACK INCOMING HOLD HOLD HOLD UP VOTE AND SHARE

In the last hour of trading some of us are predicting they will launch a short ladder attack to make it look like it’s selling off to trick you into selling your shares. Their goal is to go under $115 to get out of their expiring contracts. This will be a major victory for them.

Hedge funds sell back and forth with one another at lower and lower bids in rapid succession, tricking algorithms into thinking there is a mass sell off when there actually isn’t. (They do this to scare off retail investors to engineer a sell off). Once the attack is over, the stock will normally go back up due to its demand. Then they will rinse and repeat their attack, each time hoping to chip away more and more retail investors. Most people in here know this, so if retail investors are selling, it’s unlikely that it’s anyone at all.

ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS HOLD HOLD HOLD! DON'T GET PAPER HANDS DURING THE LAST HOUR, ITS WHAT THEY WANT!

GET RID OF THE STOP LOSSES, THEY WILL TRY HUNT THEM

It's possible the ladder attack at the end of day yesterday was just a trial run for today. They held the price where they wanted it (around 227) for ages, and then with just one ladder attack got it to 197 which had two effects:

1.	⁠⁠Caused a volatility halt at 15:59:41 - so we had no chance to get it back over 200 in those remaining 19 seconds 2) Made sure the EOD price was under 200

I think today there is a chance that they won't go for 150, 115 or 100, but just take the guarantee of hitting under 200. Take a beating over a killing.

They will want it resting on around 227 and then time their attack to sneak it just under 200 with the halt in place to see out the clock. So if it is ~227+ with under 10 mins to go, we know what they will do. And those few minutes before it could be crucial.

How to Buy GME etc [Loophole]

Robinhood and other shitty brokerages are allowing us to buy 2, 5, or very low numbers of GME. However, they are allowing option contracts.

Here’s a trick that will work.

1) Go to Feb 5 option. 2) Scroll all the way down the call list 3) Buy GME call option with the cheapest +x.xx% 4) Immediately exercise.

I just exercised 2 contracts and now have 200 shares, blocking the shorts. You can repeat this process over and over if you are buying a lot.

Best of luck out there! Let’s get them!!!

SHORT LADDER ATTACK INCOMING HOLD HOLD HOLD BUY BUY BUY

UPVOTE AND SHARE

In the last hour of trading some of us are predicting they will launch a short ladder attack to make it look like it’s selling off to trick you into selling your shares. Their goal is to go under $115 to get out of their expiring contracts. This will be a major victory for them.

Hedge funds sell back and forth with one another at lower and lower bids in rapid succession, tricking algorithms into thinking there is a mass sell off when there actually isn’t. (They do this to scare off retail investors to engineer a sell off). Once the attack is over, the stock will normally go back up due to its demand. Then they will rinse and repeat their attack, each time hoping to chip away more and more retail investors. Most people in here know this, so if retail investors are selling, it’s unlikely that it’s anyone at all.

You will have to sign an agreement in order to be able of trading in USA, acknowledging that you have to tax 15% of your profits in the US. This can be done online quite fast, and I recommend using an ISK account since you otherwise need to tax 30% of you profits in Sweden. In an ISK account you only pay 1,25% annual tax of the entire value of your account.

SHORT LADDER ATTACK INCOMING HOLD HOLD HOLD UP VOTE AND SHARE

In the last hour of trading some of us are predicting they will launch a short ladder attack to make it look like it’s selling off to trick you into selling your shares. Their goal is to go under $115 to get out of their expiring contracts. This will be a major victory for them.

Hedge funds sell back and forth with one another at lower and lower bids in rapid succession, tricking algorithms into thinking there is a mass sell off when there actually isn’t. (They do this to scare off retail investors to engineer a sell off). Once the attack is over, the stock will normally go back up due to its demand. Then they will rinse and repeat their attack, each time hoping to chip away more and more retail investors. Most people in here know this, so if retail investors are selling, it’s unlikely that it’s anyone at all.

ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS HOLD HOLD HOLD! DON'T GET PAPER HANDS DURING THE LAST HOUR, ITS WHAT THEY WANT!

GET RID OF THE STOP LOSSES, THEY WILL TRY HUNT THEM

It's possible the ladder attack at the end of day yesterday was just a trial run for today. They held the price where they wanted it (around 227) for ages, and then with just one ladder attack got it to 197 which had two effects:

1.	⁠⁠Caused a volatility halt at 15:59:41 - so we had no chance to get it back over 200 in those remaining 19 seconds 2) Made sure the EOD price was under 200

I think today there is a chance that they won't go for 150, 115 or 100, but just take the guarantee of hitting under 200. Take a beating over a killing.

They will want it resting on around 227 and then time their attack to sneak it just under 200 with the halt in place to see out the clock. So if it is ~227+ with under 10 mins to go, we know what they will do. And those few minutes before it could be crucial.

1. Now, for RH, even if that kills their chances at IPO this year, they can still get fundings from others. This is not the first time they reported their IPO. Also, this is not the first scandal that they had, a lot of people know how shitty they are, but they also know that they're printing money every year.

2. I know, but way too many are putting a lot of their money in the line and not only they might lose everything, they might also not even accomplish what they're planning to. Right now, they're hurting a little bit the big guys but at the end of this, the ""big guys"" will make money from this like they always do.

3. Maybe, then the big guys will just wait until it goes back down. They can wait years without any issue since the interest rates are so low right now.
