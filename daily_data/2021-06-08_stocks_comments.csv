12,AMZN," Simply knowing an industry is a huge leg-up.  I'm in IT, so I'm reasonably current on what's going on in the semiconductor world and tech stocks.  It's not like a magic panacea, but it's easier to have convictions about a company when you're familiar with them, their products, public sentiment about them, etc.  My oldest holding (outside 401k stuff) is Google.  They've about doubled annualized market returns since I bought.

Another one is just being a step ahead of the market...  There's a meta-game there, where you're predicting where money is going to go in the short term and getting there first.  

For example:  When the market took a dump because Covid in March 2020, you can sit down, think what companies might flourish in this new scenario.  

* Online shopping?  Amazon doubled in 5 months

* Meal delivery? Grubhub doubled in like 5 months

* Online meetings?  Zoom was like 5x in 7 months. (bought at $131, sold at $487 six months later)

* Delivery services?  FedEx almost tripled in six months.  UPS wasn't quite as meteoric, but still almost doubled in 5 months. (Bought FDX and $117, sold half at $240 about 10 months later, still have the rest)

* Online document signing?  Docusign over doubled in 5 months.  

* At the time, there was serious panic about airlines -- I assumed the government isn't going to let the entire industry go bankrupt, bought UA at $21 and sold at $31 in 11 days.  

In that six month timeframe, you'd have done just fine with the S&P too, with upwards of 50% gains... But I'll take 5x over 1.5x any day.

Covid was obviously a pretty rare scenario, but similar opportunities present themselves if you pay attention.  

* When oil futures went negative during the covid crisis, USL dropped to $10/share, and is currently back at $24/share.  (I bought at $10 and got out at $16 or so 4 months later)

* Able to predict materials shortage and stuff?  Bought CMC at $20, sold at $32 six months later.

* When Peleton announced their recall a month ago, their stock dropped to $80/share.  Peleton owners are cult-like in their devotion.  Currently back to $110 or so.  (I bought at 80.49 and got out at $96 11 days later because it still looked overvalued at $80 to me)

* I ate at a Chipotle in the early days, when they weren't all that common, and I even had the thought ""I should totally buy stock in Chipotle"".  14 years later, I still kick myself for not throwing money at it back then. (like 1500% gains)

Caveats:

Obviously there's risk with any of this -- sometimes you might jump the wrong way.  I've lost a bundle on oil stocks pre-covid, underperformed the market with Verisign during Covid, losing money relative to the market with AMZN stock right now, I have some super-boring stock like MRK which is underperforming, etc.  I thought BRK was going to explode since they were sitting on piles of cash and could pick up companies on the cheap during the pandemic, but I underestimated just how fast the market would bounce back.  I still own those shares and they've even beaten the market with them, but man, if I'd only thrown more money at ZM instead...  Then you'll just completely miss things, like I assumed the housing market would be *dead* during the pandemic.  Stupid...

I always take at least rudimentary looks at financials.  I think it's important to look at a risk/reward scenario even if I'm not trying to do my own DCF models.  That's why I'm a scaredy cat with stuff like PTON and UA, both held under 2 weeks.  I know I'm playing with fire.

Another one is just being a step ahead of the market...  There's a meta-game there, where you're predicting where money is going to go in the short term and getting there first.  

For example:  When the market took a dump because Covid in March 2020, you can sit down, think what companies might flourish in this new scenario.  

* Online shopping?  Amazon doubled in 5 months

* Meal delivery? Grubhub doubled in like 5 months

* Online meetings?  Zoom was like 5x in 7 months. (bought at $131, sold at $487 six months later)

* Delivery services?  FedEx almost tripled in six months.  UPS wasn't quite as meteoric, but still almost doubled in 5 months. (Bought FDX and $117, sold half at $240 about 10 months later, still have the rest)

* Online document signing?  Docusign over doubled in 5 months.  

* At the time, there was serious panic about airlines -- I assumed the government isn't going to let the entire industry go bankrupt, bought UA at $21 and sold at $31 in 11 days.  

In that six month timeframe, you'd have done just fine with the S&P too, with upwards of 50% gains... But I'll take 5x over 1.5x any day.

Covid was obviously a pretty rare scenario, but similar opportunities present themselves if you pay attention.  

* When oil futures went negative during the covid crisis, USL dropped to $10/share, and is currently back at $24/share.  (I bought at $10 and got out at $16 or so 4 months later)

* Able to predict materials shortage and stuff?  Bought CMC at $20, sold at $32 six months later.

* When Peleton announced their recall a month ago, their stock dropped to $80/share.  Peleton owners are cult-like in their devotion.  Currently back to $110 or so.  (I bought at 80.49 and got out at $96 11 days later because it still looked overvalued at $80 to me)

* I ate at a Chipotle in the early days, when they weren't all that common, and I even had the thought ""I should totally buy stock in Chipotle"".  14 years later, I still kick myself for not throwing money at it back then. (like 1500% gains)

Caveats:

Obviously there's risk with any of this -- sometimes you might jump the wrong way.  I've lost a bundle on oil stocks pre-covid, underperformed the market with Verisign during Covid, losing money relative to the market with AMZN stock right now, I have some super-boring stock like MRK which is underperforming, etc.  I thought BRK was going to explode since they were sitting on piles of cash and could pick up companies on the cheap during the pandemic, but I underestimated just how fast the market would bounce back.  I still own those shares and they've even beaten the market with them, but man, if I'd only thrown more money at ZM instead...  Then you'll just completely miss things, like I assumed the housing market would be *dead* during the pandemic.  Stupid...

I always take at least rudimentary looks at financials.  I think it's important to look at a risk/reward scenario even if I'm not trying to do my own DCF models.  That's why I'm a scaredy cat with stuff like PTON and UA, both held under 2 weeks.  I know I'm playing with fire.

23,AMC," They're already there. These are moves that should have been made or at least already in the works. I'm watching gamestop completely transform while all I hear about amc is potential. What have they done to try and prove that potential? Have they made moves towards any of the things you've mentioned? Thats a genuine question as I don't follow amc like I do a few other companies. 

From my view, anything amc can offer me, I'd much rather have in the comfort of my own home. To drink and smoke as I please with friends who can get as loud as they want. 

This paired with going to movies is just so damn expensive. How are you gonna compete when I can get ESPN, HBO, Hulu, disney+ AND Netflix for $50 a month. You'd have to give me free access for a month for less than $50 just to get me to consider it. Even then it wouldn't replace my home entertainment. Not by a long shot. 

I agree with you that it could be done. But I also agree that it would take the right kind of management to make it happen. That's not something I think they have. Get a new CEO, shake things up, and maybe I'll change my opinion. Until then I just see a dying company. It's a shame too cause they could have prevented this with a little bit of proaction. It's not like Hulu and Netflix sprung up out of nowhere last March. AMC has known its competition for years and has done nothing to change its business model to continue to compete.

29,AMC," XXX AMC holder here. Let's get the obvious out the way first. AMC holders are not in it because of the market value of the company or fundamentals. I can tell you right now as an xxx AMC holder, I don't give a shit. 

AMC holders are in it for the squeeze. Once the shorts are finished. Most folks are gonna bounce. Simple as that. 

Now as for the actual company itself and its future. Movie theatres are indeed dying. But they're not gonna just evaporate overnight like some folks seem to think. This is a $40 billion industry. It's gonna be a slow process that'll take a few years. And with some smart decisions, they can delay that process further at the very least before their inevitable end. 

AMC as a company was already on a slow decline to bankruptcy. But the pandemic unnaturally sped that process up exponentially and put them in crippling debt. However, they were also *extremely* lucky  to ride the memestock short squeeze frenzy and secure enough liquid capital to keep them running for a few good years. Will they be able to potentially turn things around with some new innovative ideas? I don't know. Doesn't really matter either way, cause that's not why most of us are holding AMC.

If the votes exceed the total supply of 70M, it is proof that the shorts did not cover and are selling iou‚Äôs.

GME is meant to be held until the hedge funds who shorted it cover and it squeezes to who knows where.  Think of Volkswagen back in I think it was 2013.  Damn thing shot up to about $800 in one day-I believe-due to a short squeeze.  This is the same situation for GME, only the hedge funds involved are incredibly skilled in bending the rules in order to hide the magnitude of the problem like the true short interest, number of shorted shares, etc.

Hopefully tomorrow, or at least in 2-4 business days when they file their 8K with the SEC, they will reveal the number of actual votes counted.  If they exceed the total float of 70M, then I expect total mayhem to ensue afterward.  It would prove that the shorts still exist despite the hedge funds telling congress that they had covered and it would prove that they, mostly Citadel-the hedge fund/market maker/authorized participant- have been selling synthetic shares for quite a while.

Even if it was only a small chance of it going up, statistically, it is still worth it for me to invest based in what i see the upside and downside being. I may be wrong, but if i due my DD, over the long run, i feel very confident in the numbers strategy.

Add in that the initial investment isnt even large to get potential large upside with minimal potential losses, and i dont really see why anyone wouldnt get a share or 2 *just in case* all the research is right.

.

Do note: its called a meme stock, but its not all a meme or gambling. There is tons of fantastic research and even official research papers dating back decades on this exact scenario, relating to mass shorting and massive shortcomings of the digital systems in place. Now in the end theres always a chance its right and a chance its wrong, and please note that im not trying to appeal to FOMO for this next part. In 08 there was the housing market crash, and people were predicting it and discussing all the info on it for years beforehand. This time, people are predicting another similar crash, and have been giving a lot of info on it. Even people who may not think this is the catalyst are predicting a crash. If you want, i can give you some resources and info for you to look at, and you may decide it is worth it to hedge your current plays. You may also decide not to.

Now it is popular again and maybe it will $25, but do you know when to sell or are you going to be holding down to $8 again?

140,AMC," Basically it comes down to massive uncertainty, GME/AMC are perfect examples atm. They may go up sharply, they may go down sharply, or they may hover for weeks/months. It's the sharp changes that are problematic, and make it risky. AMC is a good example. It's currently about $56/share. down a bit from it's high of 52 week high of 72, but up a ton from it's 52 week low of about $2. AMC has increased by 28X it's low and it's high was 36X it's low. It's up 4X what it was a week ago.

The real issue is it's not clear when it get in or get out, and being wrong will hurt, a lot. If the price goes back up to $72, then that's a decent profit, but what if it drops to $20 instead, that would be a very heavy loss, and you'd really have to consider HODL until it's hopefully goes up a bunch again at some point in the future.

142,AMC," Idk about snobbery but a lot of ‚Äúpurist‚Äù have been investing for years. Unlike a lot of the new retail traders since Jan. Most of whom don‚Äôt even know what a 10k is. Let alone a financial statement and how to read it. The ‚Äúpurist‚Äù  has most likely seen a lot. Reverse spilts, stock dilution, buy back, bankruptcy, mergers good earnings bad earnings. I know I‚Äôve held companies in the past four years since I started that went through these scenario‚Äôs  listed. The only real constant that determines if a company survives  in all of that is the financials. A business is only profitable if they are producing something worth something. and (and a good management). It‚Äôs my opinion that the ‚Äúpurist‚Äù see all this and know this is not sustainable. I mean let‚Äôs be real is AMC really worth 30 billion?!?!? Well at roughly $ 60 a share that‚Äôs what the market cap is about. I believe if you look the ‚Äúmeme‚Äù stocks, you will find the financials are terrible. Most are loaded debt and haven‚Äôt had a profitable quarter in years.

143,AMC," I'm invested in AMC and GME, and I think everyone who isn't is making a mistake, but I understand why they would stay away:

Thing about meme stocks is that they are more obviously a bet than others. The bet in AMC and GME is that they are both shorted significantly and will squeeze as a result. This is basically a hostage negotiation, investors don't care about fundamentals because it isn't about fundamentals, it's about short sellers being obligated to buy your shares.

The issue there is that whether these companies are in fact shorted to the levels needed for a squeeze is a matter of a lot of speculation, with basically all media outlets insisting that it is not the case. So in order to take this bet, you have to wager that the powers that be are lying about the market conditions. If that is the case, then ""fundamentals"" become almost meaningless. Fundamentals would represent at best the justification for why a certain company is selected to be manipulated up or down, but not an actual predictor of a stock's performance.

Anyone who has really researched and followed this knows the fundamentals and outlook for GME is incredible, as well as probably many of the other ""meme stocks"" -- that's why, at least for GME, it was discovered in the first place by DFV, Burry, Cohen et al and why it's not going away.

179,NYC," This is wildly optimistic. I'm not saying you aren't making reasonable points, but let's just take off the rose colored glasses for a sec.

>So there is this silly thing people believe, it's something like ‚Äúinfinite economic growth is impossible.‚Äù I hear it a lot on Reddit 

I'm not particularly thrilled with the average redditors analysis either, but the commonly understood idea they are referring to is that there are limitations, be they technological, energetic, resource-based, etc that will/do put real physical limits on economic capacity.

>There is no reason to believe that economic growth has a cap on it. Humanity is far more efficient, productive and intelligent than it ever has been. 

Humanity is more productive, even on a per capita basis, however, one cursory glance at the physical world indicates that how we are achieving this productivity has costs that are externalities from our economic system that will pay dividends both now and in the future.  

Every ecosystem on earth is in decline.

The topsoil losses have been alarming.  A third of all farmland is moderately to extremely degraded.

Climate change is well understood to have massive economic consequences as well as exacerbate nearly all other environmental issues. Expectations are between 2 and 10% per year.

The oceans are an absolute disaster.

I won't keep going, but I will just state that everything we do from mining to deicing the roads has massive consequences and very few of those are ever being taken seriously.  We are very much building towards a world that is largely uninhabitable and will limit population growth and/or require massive investment just to hold on.  We can replace our Aquifers and the the Colorado River in CA by building desal plants, but then we need to build massive solar and wind resources just to power those and then huge pipeline systems to carry that water to all the places and farms that require it, all of which needs pumps because the sea is lower.  We could build skyscraper indoor farms that produce more food with less inputs, but we would need nearly four hundred 100 storey buildings with a 1 acre base just to feed NYC.  Currently there are only 24 buildings in the world 100 storeys or taller, just to put the scope in perspective.  

We need more solutions than we have and in order to implement even the ones we have, we need a much larger and better educated workforce. 

>Just think about farming alone. 300 years ago you're looking about 90% of the population were farmers, in 1900 it was about 40%, now it's about 1.3% of the American population and America is a net exporter of food. 

And how has that been achieved?  3 things have made that possible, in my opinion.

1.  Genetically modified crops (which is a good thing, I'm 100% for GMOs.  Tomatoes aren't a naturally occurring plant, they have been genetically modified using Mendelian techniques)

2. Fossil fuels.  The labor to till, seed, plant, irrigate etc have been replaced by fossil fuels.  This cannot continue forever

3.  Large scale chemical manufacturing and dispersal.  Nearly everything put on plants from fertilizers to herbicides to pesticides to preservatives.  This is largely unsustainable, has nasty effects on soil, water, insect populations and ecosystems.  This is before you factor in that some if these are petrochemicals or made from natural gas.

The point is that we have reduced labor and increased productivity in ways that cannot continue forever.  Your point that this is somehow indicative of forever rising economic outlooks doesn't imagine the massive problems in this space.  Nobody knows what the horizon on decreased agricultural output is, but it's not a super rosey picture.

>Someone working minimum wage can afford to feed themselves for a day with about 1-2 hours of work. 

If they eat complete garbage, yeah.  A person making 7.25 takes home maybe 5.40 an hour, probably less.  Two hours barely covers one meal at Chipotle with a drink.  It could cover a chicken and some small additional items at a grocer, but who are we kidding?  They don't have an apartment at minimum wage anywhere in the country.

>That boost to human productivity is massive. So even though you might be mopping floors in Mcdonalds, you're still massively more productive than you would have been 100 years ago when putting food on the table took the majority of your working time. 

What? No.  Productivity gains by sector are wildly different.  When aggregated, it looks like everyone is more productive, but when disaggregated it tells a very different story.  Slinging a mop in 2021 is the same as slinging a mop in 1980.  Maybe the floor detergent is a little better, but I doubt it's that impactful.

>This progress of productivity is felt everywhere. Including with companies and their margins. They can produce more for less and you can consume more for less. The more consumption and gdp the more room for total gross profit.

While productivity has increased in most industries, margins have increased largely by paying people less.  The decoupling of productivity gains and wage increases tells the story of bottom lines as well as anything else.  Labor has been a decreasing cost per unit of output since 1970, when it peaked.

>Think about how insane it is that the internet age is only about 25 years old and the massive leap in productivity and utility that has added. 

Technological revolutions tend to do that.

>Maybe the markets are still catching up to that leap forward. Now think about 1900, when cars weren't even mainstream. 

Look at the average PE of a cloud computing company or software company and make the case that the market is ""catching up"".

>Of course the market has gone up for 100 years. And of course it's up as the widespread adoption of the computer has taken hold. 


Past performance is not an indicator of future performance.  The last 100 years have been environmentally stable and the last 80 have been extremely politically stable when compared against the whole of human history.  Your chance of dying in war in 2021 is the lowest it has ever been.  All it would take to change that are mass migrations from climate change or other environmental disasters, sufficiently rising prices, aggression between China and the US, or Russia and the EU, or even just the sum of environmental issues and the late response to them.  

I'm not saying any of this will happen this year, or even that it will happen at all.  Your point is that the economy can grow forever and it really can't.  

You know that bullshit line that when the govt runs a deficit you are ""mortgaging your children's future""?

The ketamine industry specifically is booming, although there is uncertainty such as how the treatment requires maintenance dosing for most patients and long term ketamine use in recreational users develops bladder/urinary issues, will we see that in patients in a few years?

1. COVID is over
2. Horny girl summer is alive and well
3. Hard seltzer is still super hot and growing wildly.
4. [Demand for Topo Chico Hard Seltzer is real](https://www.goodbeerhunting.com/sightlines/2021/4/22/topo-chico-hard-seltzer-shows-theres-room-for-more-seltzer)
5. Not enough shelf space or supply for Topo thus far has been made, leaving shortages
6. Molson Coors is set to benefit if they can increase production and shelf space to meet unserviced demand. Look for incremental sales growth to add a SAM-like multiple to their current valuation.
7. Topo Chico, using Coca Cola's distribution and marketing might, [will be the first hard seltzer to enter the Chinese market.](http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202106/04/WS60b9823ba31024ad0bac38e4.html)
8. If after proof of concepts, Topo can be the first hard seltzer to come out with a bottled version, leveraging the tremendous name equity and look of their Topo Chico mineral water line, they could have a massive on-premise and hospitality hit on their hands. No one is ordering White Claw cans at a hotel bar, restaurant or club. Save that for the pool, beach and frat house. They could also break into the previously untapped older, well traveled Millenial/GenX category, who wouldn't be caught dead holding a White Claw can. A Topo seltzer with lime, a la Corona, looks so much better. I could see this eating away at Corona sales, especially right now when Corona sales are weak.

237,SWIM," Just gonna toss this out there - Latham Group (Ticker: SWIM).

  
No, it's not heavily shorted. It's also not heavily traded (Since IPO 4/23 average volume is at 369,000)

  
Here's the gist: their projected net annual sales growth for 2021 is 44-54%, which is after already tripling their sales in 2020 from 2019. For reference, in 2020, they did about $403, and for 2021 they're projecting north of $580.

  
This is a traditional ""Wall Street Bets"" proposition. I'm not suggesting it because it's heavily shorted, or shorted at all (although that could happen if WSB piled in), but more because it's a good company, with good fundamentals, an established global presence with offices on several continents, and strong future growth.

296,TV," I don't know if this kind of stuff is really organized or not (#conspiracy), but, for a while, it looks like big players in the market were pushing these inflation fears in the media and on TV, and rotation towards value stocks. That made a number of growth stocks go down and down.

Now the trend is reversing. This could either be organic, a short squeeze, or it could be that this was the plan all along. They tell you in the media that you should sell your tech and buy growth, but while that's happening, they're doing the opposite, and buying tech while it's low. Once they have enough of a position in tech and growth, they let the trend reverse.

I'm not a betting person, but my intuition would be that now, tech and growth stocks are headed towards new all-time highs. The inflation fears will magically subside.

I think the whole banking infrastructure in the US is miles behind, no uptake on contactless technology, no instant payments. Both of those things have been standard around the world for the last 20years+.

Cashapp and Venmo are the alternatives, but they aren't banks, so you're money is not insured (I think), and they don't have physical cards afaik, no ability to take credit, and they don't offer savings accounts/interest. SQ is doing well I agree, but they have a lot of parts to their business. At one point their POS systems were the biggest part of the business, if it wasn't for cashapp I think it might still be.

I really don't know why this is the way it is, but the US is so backwards when it comes to payments and money. Still signing for payments is mental.

I'm torn because I think the floor is probably permanently raised, I dont understand the price action right now holding steady.

Who exactly should feel dumb ? The ones who participated in GME originally are now in wealth preservation part of their lives. Yet you feel insecure enough to leave the meme sub reddits and try to convince other sub reddits of this and that. 

Stock was shorted 140%, when the stock price kept rising rapidly, everyone and their mothers was sure there is not a short from the original 140% that is not underwater at that time, now its shorted under 30% and the shorts might be all at very high positions.

A thing happened where it was theorized that Media companies wanted to ""see"" what the reddits were talking about and push some ""other"" things like silver and rocket etc.

This got wierd when all of a sudden some random ticker kept getting mentioned. I forget what it was now but it was like SHF or some German company.  People theorized it was bots talking it up because there was so much discussion on Short Hedge Funds (SHF)...   Nobody was actually talking about that ticker.   So one day everyone typed in $CUM and a few others and sure enough that because a ""pushed"" ticker.

> ""Both Gamestop and Wendys have been sharing in this Social Media 'Beef"" or 'Metapragmatic Roasting' of each other. Their Twitter profiles are actively following each other and going off each others posts,"" the Reddit post explained.
- https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/wendys-stock-price-reddit-post-chicken-tendies-meme-stock-rally-2021-6-1030503972

The market rally is driven by people expecting others to rally and it's a chance for short term gains, due to being another plausible meme like AMC or doggy-coin or silver, pretty much. Will it take off? Who even knows anymore - it might just trend enough to do so and actually be an opportunity, but only in the sense of being a genuine candidate for the [Greater Fool Theory](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/greaterfooltheory.asp), not because of a change in business model or anything substantial aside from social media hype. 

People here who are calling it some sort of evil mastermind plan to distract from their favorite stock are wrong, in that there is no evidence of that whatsoever, at all. And a market rally is not a pump and dump unless it is specifically coordinated by people to dump their shares.

It's some people hyping it up for fun and also being kind of serious though, but it is not based on anything specifically about the business. The post linked WSB post, which made the news, its primary argument is:

1. They have a cool summer salad option on the menu (not that big of a deal)
2. ""Wendys social media profile is no stranger to memes""
3. ""Both Gamestop and Wendys have been sharing in Social Media 'Beef' roasting each other""
4. Wendies is inherently memeable because of WSB chicken tendies meme, ""Wendys Chicken Tendies. Literally the perfect stock for this sub.""

That's it. They are a meme that people might rally around, so people are rallying around it on the chance that it takes off as another meme stock rally.",TSM-,3,/r/stocks/comments/nvbe1k/what_is_going_on_with_wendys/h12oy2v/,0.077,0.793,0.13,0.9228

It'll either become huge, or fizzle out as many alternative fuel companies do. We'll see.

525,IMO,"  - Honda @ $21.7K: Lasts ten years without problems.    
 - Ford @ $21K: Lasts five years then problems.    

Apples and oranges. But regardless Ford has had a massive run-up recently:   

 - 107.70% YoY   
 - 26.23% 3 months
 - 33.16% 1 month   
 - 5.11% 1 week   
 
Ford below $11 back in January this year was a great buy IMO. Ford at $15.65 today? Seems too much too soon. It could easily see a pull-back before re-settling at a similar price after positive sales figures from the Lightning/Maverick.

So most of the brokers you have access to will have to fall under the EUs CSDR regulations. The reason shares are 'pooled' in this way is because it's so much cheaper then buying individual CREST accounts for each user.

So to get away from the Omnibus method you'll need to find a broker that is happy for you to have your own CREST account - in the UK Hargreaves Lansdown is one that springs to mind. The annual fee the last time I checked is about 8k for your own segregated account.

If that doesn't work. Check out CSDR it's a surprisingly easy to understand piece of regulation and will answer a lot of the questions you have about nominee / omnibus accounts.",Codf,1,/r/stocks/comments/nv23uy/how_brokers_with_omnibus_accounts_actually_work/h123i9d/,0.0,0.878,0.122,0.9299

552,DD," I just spent the last 2 months suffering from some of the worst abdominal pain I‚Äôve ever had. I saw 4 different doctors that all had different diagnosis. So I was following 4 different treatment plans and still in pain. Last week, I finally got some imaging done and found out it was something totally easy to fix and not at all what the docs had thought. All of them had good reason to diagnose me the way they did, but they were simply wrong. 

DD is not necessary, but it‚Äôs a good idea to make informed opinions for anything in life- especially when it involves your money (and ultimately your well being). Experts are sometimes wrong. And even if they‚Äôre not, they may have a totally different risk tolerance than you or they may have an approach that fits their investment style (and wallet) but not yours. 

Following others blindly will never help you grow as an investor, and you will undoubtedly lose your money without ever having learned anything.
