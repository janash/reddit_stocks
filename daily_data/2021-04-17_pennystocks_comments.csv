16,SP," Okay,

Here is another point of estimation of share price which would be more consistent with current state of affairs.  On youtube there is a presentation by Mr. Steinke (the wizard behind the curtains of this WHOLE endeavor).  In it he has a cool graph showing for unconventional plays (which I am to understand is valued lower then this one since it is conventional so these calcs should be VERY conservative) at different time points in wild cate exploration using data from multiple drilling exp. in multiple countries.

The ""I think we could have something category"" where we were based on the aeromagnetic surveys and prior work done in the basin nearby in remote past put us at this level.  At that state of exploration it was priced at $40/ acre.    

Now we are in the ""Okay we proved there is some functional hydrocarbon petroleum system down there"" phase.  That price is $850/ acre.  Shareholders get to profit from a total of:  6,770,000 acres of the total we have leased (that is -10% for NAMCOR in Namibia+ -50% of Botswana for farm out).  So...

6,770,000x 850= $5,670,000,000 value. ($5.67 BILLION)

Take that $5.67 BILLION value/ current market cap of:  900 MILLION= 6.3x of current market cap. 

So. current that means SP of $6.10 x6.3 multiples= SP should be now at this stage is: $38.00.

I remember when I purchased a month+ ago I used that formula at that time and it was pretty spot on to the market cap at that point so that back of the envelope worked back then.  Obvious, no guarantee it is true still, but seems rational enough if you have to find something to value this play current.

Again I appreciate any folks in this trade of O+G to correct or add to this discussion.",10xwannabe,6,/r/pennystocks/comments/msrewz/recaf_potential/guvpl9g/,0.01,0.886,0.104,0.9671

21,VERY," Nothing specific to this play, but we are talking about a third world country with a MAJOR economic find.  A type of find that has caused wars to break out in past generations in different parts of the world.  

Namibia itself is a democratic country who has been and has expressed interest in more foreign investments.  In the end money talks though.  That is good since the oil branch of Namibia (NAMCOR) own 10% of the play in the Namibian part of the basin.  IF they had the knowledge, money, resources, etc... to do it themselves they would have GENERATIONS ago or even now.  They don't and need a partner and up to this point the government seems VERY happy with the current direction.  

RECAF does have not only oil exploration rights, but production rights  as well via contracts with government in place since the beginning.  So that has already been taken care of.  Namibia will make a ton of money (10%)+ royalties forever without taking any financial risk of loss or costs to produce.  Pretty good deal to me, no?

22,ALL," Haywood PT is at this current point in the game.  They update PT and risk every step of the process.  We were at $7 PT until the last PR release and $4 before that.  

The value I gave is just using all the guestimate data from Jarvie (who has been right so far with an distinguished career so won't doubt him until he is proven wrong) and Haywood estimates.  That PT would be conservative if it ALL plays out AND fully developed (may take years) based on current available numbers. 

When I entered the play it was a play for 2021 and would sell at EOY if we hit only dirt.  If we hit oil (looks like the answer is yes so far) by 2021 then it becomes a 2-5 year play for me as it will take A LOT of time to start drilling this basin, get numbers on the different basins, continue to farm out, etc...

 I was hoping someone with some experience in this field will bring me down to ground level and point out errors in the numbers with their experience.

26,NOW," They are spudding (starting) well 2 at end of April.  Consider 30- 45 days to drill.  They will be doing 2d seismic analysis same time (permit is near approval).  That crunching of data will be the next big catalyst even before well 3.  So maybe 1-2 months to get all that done.

The issue (if you call it that) is they originally stated the idea was to finish all 3 wells+ 2d seismics then release data at once sometime in late spring/ early summer.  This, of course, did not happen as they planned. That is the issue with these plays you have NO clue when they will announce results so the only way to be sure you are there is to INTENTIONALLY bag hold through the whole process.  That is what I did I bought thinking I won't hear anything for awhile, but didn't trust some leaking well before that (which is what happened).

You have to decide if you want to buy now or see if there is a dip later on.  
Waiting about 2-4 weeks after a big run up I find is the best time to buy.   The problem with this one is trying to figure out what the market feels is appropriate valuation NOW.  Are they still undervalued at $6 so will run up to $10 (for example) before dropping back down to $8(for example) OR will they start going down now and settle at $4.
