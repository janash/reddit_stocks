0,SI," I have a question while I wait to read this post. This may be a stupid question. I'm a long term investor and never pay attention to stuff like this. So if I'm understanding the situation here correctly, reported SI is down from over ~120% to 50-60% according to Ortex and S3 over the weekend. People are unconvinced as there is not enough volume for the shorts to cover in that time (and shouldn't the price move up instead of down if they're buying hard to get stocks?). Institutional investors hold a large amount of the stock, so could the shorts in theory cut a deal with the long institutional investors to cover at a more reasonable rate? If that's possible, would the market volume reflect that deal?

1,GME," >One person in the comments made an astute observation that perhaps the  truth, which some may find disturbing, is that our fate really lies in  the hands of the whales on the long side rather than retail being in the  driver's seat.

When GME first hit about 300 there were reports that Blackrock had already made billions of dollars. I think that this has been the truth all along.

And people have been railing against the media for backing the institutional investors and being mad at retail for beating the big guy at his own game. In fact, the media is perpetuating this bad-optics lie because the truth is even worse: not only did WSB not beat the big guys at their own game, they were never even playing in the first place. Now people think that retail investors are much more powerful than we really are.

3,RH," As usual I'm late to the conversation. I do want to say that with all the WSB fervor this has been a tremendous learning experience for me. I've been investing play money little by little on RH for two years now. I've learned more about the details of investing over this weekend than I have over the last two years. Like others I watched *The Big Short* and have *All the Devils are Here* waiting on my shelf to be read. Because of all the Robinhood drama, I opened an Fidelity brokerage account, which my retirement happens to be with as well. I can now keep track of it better through the app. For me, there is a lot of secondary and tertiary good things coming out of this situation. 

I may have bought a handful of shares in a certain movie theater chain and I may be holding them with a grip made out of compressed carbon. They have been playing old movies for $5 cheap. I've seen awesome ones like T2, Goldfinger, Alien, and The Empire Strikes Back— I think that's great they've been doing that and I hope they keep it up. On the other hand, I'm not the type of person to dump all of my savings into an emotional craze. I set a low-ball limit buy and waited.

4,DD," Here's the thing about the DD posted all over Reddit.  It all makes sense.  There are a dozen DD posts on Reddit and the way it's laid out makes sense.  There are a dozen DD articles on why it's already over.  And it all makes sense.  I feel like I'm Dorothy standing in front of the Wizard of Oz before the curtain gets pulled back.  I just don't know enough about how the guys behind the curtain are pulling the switches.

I should've sold at $350.  I was waiting for $400-$500 (in non-after-hours trading).  Profit would've been great at $350, but the DD numbers made sense.  So I waited.

I was in for 174 @ $120.  I sold 107 this morning at break-even price for those 3 lots.  No harm no foul, lesson learned (?), and disappointment that I wasn't smart enough to see what was happening even in the face of what I believed to be good DD.

I still have 67 @ $165, about half that lot is in the mid $30's so profits on one offset some of the losses on the other.  

The most likely scenario is that I'll exit that with a loss of some kind.  The next most likely scenario is that I exit at break even.  I will have spent the last 2 weeks (and maybe another next week) watching and reading and panicking for nothing.  And that's the best-case scenario unless the run-up is supersonic.

The problem is still that I think the DD is good.  I think the theory and the numbers and the math are good.  I just think that I'm not smart enough for this game and I'm not willing to risk my family's money trying to prove it one way or the other.  If I lost it all my wife would be mad, extremely mad, but we wouldn't miss a mortgage, we wouldn't go hungry, we would still be able to make our bills, and I'd feel like shit about putting my family in that situation.  I just don't know how to turn this into a learning lesson while still thinking the DD is good when it clearly wasn't (or maybe it is but just not yet).",taz20075,76,/r/investing/comments/lasgrh/gamestop_big_picture_theory_strategy_reality/glrd28h/,0.125,0.773,0.103,-0.8974

I was seriously considering investing a tiny amount of money ($25 out of a total $100) in GME, but decided against it. Instead, I put the entire amount in Google and Amazon; this was Thursday last week.

8,SI," 1) A question about Share Interest according to Ortex. Looking at this morning update ([https://i.ibb.co/6vGbzmf/graph.png](https://i.ibb.co/6vGbzmf/graph.png)) and doing some rough math, Short Interest was around 40-45% after yesterday's trading activities, with a deceleration in the speed at which SI has been decreasing. I am still having a hard time grasping the whole SI calculations: on one hand it seems like we've experienced a lot of same-share being lent multiple times (the whole >200% calculations made according to the number of shares being borrowed); on the other hand the 40-45% data is consistent with the SEC disclosures if you look at the number of shares vs. free float... So I am not really sure what to think: is Ortex/S3 not taking into account multiple lending of the same share? Or were those 200% calculations not taking into account shorts being covered? Can you help me understand that?   


2) I am wondering how to interpret the approximation to zero of the Days to Cover data. I feel like if the downward curve of Days to Cover is steeper than the downward curve of Share Interest (we get to Days to Cover=zero sooner than we get to Share Interest =zero) there's a chance for some upward movement-short squeeze; if Share Interest decreases faster than Days to Cover (as it has been doing) then it's over.

Many (on the WSB side) are saying that this could potentially limit the alleged short ladders that have been keeping the price of GME down.

13,IMO," Why people are still holding this after it's fallen to ~$100 is beyond me. The game was rigged against them from the start regarding bankrupting hedge funds. The smart people bought low and sold early in the spikes to $350 or so and ran as far away as they could.

It's unfortunate but many people have put in their retirement/life savings in this and won't have much left. They got swept up in social media hype from anonymous people (you know, people that can easily lie and manipulate you) and random d-list celebrities pushing them along that they will magically make 1000x their money... TBH even if the squeeze does happen, which I don't believe, it will be so fast 90% of those that are holding will miss it and will be left holding their bag either way.

What I really hate is that they convinced the guy on WSB to hold, the one that should've made like 40 millions but has lost more than half of that now. I feel he would've sold without the spotlight on him and he deserves his money TBH after holding it for years. By association, many others are holding because of the group mentality when they should all be gone from the position. What more could you have wanted than like 20x profits that we saw?

I don't know, I didn't touch these stocks because I'm risk averse and I'm OK with that but I feel a ton of people are just swept in mass hysteria at this point. If people didn't sell when a $20 stock reached $400 that's them being insane IMO.

15,EVER," I have a theory at what we've witnessed as well with GME.

I'm not one who traditionally believes in conspiracy theories, but I do know that money can cause firms, and individuals to break the law in a coordinated effort.

With as much money that was at stake here, it would not surprise me in the slightest.

First the disclaimer.

I don't own GME, and I'm not a financial advisor.

Here goes.

Exhibit A) I didn't see this mentioned on here, but I came across this article on Thursday morning about an institutional investment firm selling off their shares.

https://www.marketwatch.com/story/large-gamestop-shareholder-must-asset-management-sold-off-its-stake-2021-01-28

Hard to know exactly when this sale happened, but I'd venture to guess it was a coordinated sale between the MUST management investment firm, and the hedge funds that happened just before/after closing on Wednesday evening. TD Ameritrade, Robinhood, Webull and Interactive Brokers then coordinated between themselves, the clearing houses, and the hedge funds to lock the casual retail investor from being able to scoop up much of the stock that was dumped by MUST management that evening, and the next day.

Melvin Capital/Citadel would have likely had high level conversations with MUST management before coordinating all this.

It's a win for MUST management who would have wanted out of their position at that unprecedented valuation. The ROI for them would have to be one of their biggest wins as a firm EVER.

This explains why closing on Jan. 27th was $347.51, and opening on Jan. 28th was $265. The agreed upon sale was probably within a certain range close to $265 per share.

Keep in mind the retail investor was mostly locked out of purchasing the shares that sold near $265, meaning it would have been the hedge funds who were purchasing at that price.

Exhibit B) https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/history?p=GME

I believe this was purposefully done so that Hedge fund A could purchase the shares with minimal interference from retail investors, thus the stock came directly from MUST management.

Once Hedge Fund A had possession of those 1.3 million shares they then closed out as many of their short positions as possible with their borrower.

The borrower could then turn around and sell the shares they were now in possession of at a reduced price to Hedge Fund B. 

Hedge Fund B then went and closed out their short positions with their borrower.

They could rinse and repeat as much as needed to clear out as many shorts as possible, which is likely why the price went as low as $112.25 on Thursday. They kept coordinating the sale of the same shares back and forth all the while driving the price down minimizing their losses. 

As soon as they were happy with the amount of short positions closed, the borrowers would then be able to return those shares to the retail investors/institutional longs they burrowed from in the first place.

Who wins if this theory is even possible, AND is correct.

1) The Hedge Funds. Melvin, and Citadel who messed up in the first place by over shorting this stock. They still lost billions upon billions of dollars, but they weren't completely wiped out, as they should have been, and they lived to fight another day. Both of these funds already moved to shore up their assets by having new money injected into their funds (the every next day!).

It's really, REALLY important to notice that they only transferred billions back into their funds once they knew their plan had succeeded. This limited the liability involved if they didn't pull off their plan, as the new capital would have been lost while either buying back their shorts, or going through bankruptcy.

2) MUST management. Sold at unprecedented highs, at a likely agreed upon price. Basically no risk for them, while making a ton.

3) The borrowers. If Melvin, and Citadel went bankrupt from their idiotic mistake, as they should have, it would have been the borrowers who would have had to buy back the shorted stocks. Losing billions in the process.

4) The clearing houses. If Melvin, and Citadel could not pay for the shorts, and the borrowers could not pay for the shorts, it would have been the clearing houses who would have had to do it. Losing billions in the process.

5) Robinhood, Interactive Brokers, Webull and TD Ameritrade likely colluded with the above parties as they have made billions of dollars off the Hedge Funds over the years, and now they will continue to do so, since those Hedge Funds are still active in the market.

But then all the data recently shown by guys like S3 partners and reported by the media showed the HFs were in fact covering their shorts. Rigged or not the writing is on the wall. But somehow they will uncover the conspiracy and triumph by holding despite the goal posts moving daily.

21,ATH," Why would anybody who is up 5x or 10x in relative short time on this not sell? I don't understand this. 

Take somebody like deepfucking value, he just though Gamestop was undervalued which it was at the price he bought it at, but now gamestop is overvalued because it got caught up in al the insane hype. Gamestop ATH before this was 60 some dollars. Maybe it's worth 100 dollars per share, but most likely not. 

So deep fucking value turned 50 000 in to 25 - 50 million in like 2 years or so.

Why would he suddenly break away from his own value investing strategy and NOT sell? Makes no sense to me.  

Also let's talk Micheal J Burry from scion. Why on earth would he not have liquidated his 5% position yet? If his strategy is to buy undervalued stock his strategy is also to sell overvalued. For all we know he closed his position somewhere between 100 - 500, let it peak and opened a short position around 400. 

So I don't really believe all those guys on wsb that tell everybody they are not selling. Most of them that are in the profit have obviously started to sell and know that it's in their benefit to tell people to hold and buy the dip so there is enough liquidity for them to get out while still in the green.

If I am up 100%, I might in certain conditions hold on to my position a little bit longer. But when I am up 10x let alone 100x or 1000x? No way, why even risk it? 

The stock has clearly peaked, and will leave behind a big trail of losers that got in to late.

22,GME," Thank you for the post, very insightful

The question I have is the following:

\- We are seeing large institutional investors buy shares ([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laum38/for\_the\_scared\_little\_baby\_apestake\_a\_look\_for/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laum38/for_the_scared_little_baby_apestake_a_look_for/))

\- We know some of these are funds that had the shares and most likely sold around 300$.

These funds cashed out and are buying again, they know it's a volatile stock and bought it at a high price.

So what's their play? To me and most folks I'm reading, they are going to do some under-the-table deal with the shorts and fuck retail investors.

33,SI," Thank you for the compliments.

It's possible that the deal is conducted OTC (over the counter) directly between two parties, or in dark pools (private exchanges).  This is pretty unusual as both parties cannot be sure that they are in fact getting a fair price, but there may be other reasons behind the decision.  So in theory, definitely possible, though I have no idea how to determine how likely.

That being said, SI of 50% - 60% is still extremely high.  The greater concern from my perspective is whether any covering activity allows them to free up more liquid float.  For example, if the covering resulted in returning shares to brokerages from which they can re-borrow at a later time, then that is backup float liquidity for use in later attacks.  Not the end of the world by any means, but can draw things out longer.

This is what had me thinking they've got all of us. I couldn't sleep last night and sold at pre-market for a substantially lower loss (still up 6k from GME thank goodness, too much money for me to lose when I could help myself/my family) for this reason. I mean, the short squeeze looked like it happened last week. How could it not? Last years low was around 2.80? to 480?!? HOLY MOTHER OF FUCK.

Then it got me thinking with the short data that we can't trust. We just can't trust it. And even if the float is shorted over 100%, do **we actually know** what the consequences are of that?

45,GME," It's easy to evaluate what could you have done when things have already happened. Don't be too hard on yourself. No one really knew what the outcome was going to be.

I blew up accounts before, since then I've tried to not trade with emotions and not be overly greedy. I was able to close GME with good gains on Friday because I thought the hype was going to slow with the weekend crossing by. Plus, I live in Mexico and our market was going to be closed on the Monday holiday, so I knew I was going to be powerless either if the infinity squeeze happened or it all went down in flames. I also had the feeling that a 20x run was realistic enough to consider we were already on the squeeze. My losses have teached me that it's impossible to always sell at the top, not every dip will go up again and gains are gains, so I sold against the WSB hold mantra. At the end of the day, we all look for ourselves, and all of us would have signed with blood to get at least a 100% gain when we dumped money into our accounts.

You've not lost everything as I have before, but I'm sure it is still a good lesson. Again, don't be too hard on yourself, you were smart enough already since you were in a great gains position. I wouldn't say the same if you bought at $400. I hope you can break as even as possible and I'm sure next time you will make the right call and click that sell button.

Then the unthinkable happened last Thursday and I watched 130k turn into 17k in a matter of hours with absolutely no ability to do anything.

The social media, the memes, the hype, the promise of wealth - it was the perfect storm, and I fell for all the classic cult tactics without realizing it. Only now can I see the confirmation bias, the sunk cost fallacy, the group think, and so on. I now have so much more sympathy for people who fall for cults and scams. I see that no one is totally immune to these tactics, and its nothing to be ashamed of. It just needs to be talked about.

52,GME," >absurd claims of GME reaching astronomical levels

By any reasonable measure GME DID REACH astronomical levels. Was trading at under $20 just last month, and hit well over $400. 

&#x200B;

That is what I am struggling to understand here: This was always what was going to happen. The hope was it could get to $100! Then it was $420.69. It smashed both of those. GME wasn't ever expected by anyone to stay at $100+... yet here we are where it has spent a week+ at $100-$400. 

&#x200B;

Like, before the wild ride was anyone actually thinking it could reach $400 and just stay there? No one wanted to own Gamestop at $20-30B valuation. They wanted to ride the rocket and hop off at the apogee and fuck the shorts and bagholders in the process.",rayfound,1,/r/investing/comments/lasgrh/gamestop_big_picture_theory_strategy_reality/glrahma/,0.059,0.854,0.087,0.2558

61,SI," Doesn't it matter at which price points the remaining 50% SI were shorted? In the beginning, throughout the last week, I think it was fair to assume that a great many of the really low shorts were not yet covered, but I think they probably placed a whole lot of shorts at higher positions while they were at it. Be it to stop explosive price increases or to profit once the price finally goes back down.  
So really, if a great number of the remaining 50% SI is sitting at some kind of distribution from, say, 70$ all the way up to >300$, then that's much less pressure than we would expect if we assumed all these shorts sitting at 30$ or similar.   


Now, regarding the possibility of a squeeze, the only things that would lead me to believe that (even more of) a squeeze might still happen are that the %SI is just plain wrong and the current media shitstorm regarding SLV. I don't really trust the theory going around that what we are seeing regarding the price movements starting Thursday was all short ladders, that kind of feels like wishful thinking to me, honestly.   


It would be interesting to know how orbex and s3 arrive at their %SI estimates. That's something I haven't seen anyone discuss before. I think that they both arrive at similar numbers actually lends them a lot of credibility in my eyes.

It's very very very hard to predict price movements due to the volatility and a variance of outside variable and with that it's hard to price buy points etc. 

A buddy of mine is a very strong Technical Analyst and Researcher who has made millions trading this year and in his opinion anything GME sub 150 is a decent long term value play, when you factor a potentiality of another squeeze it's actually a very low risk investment at these price points, funnily enough. It could go 10x out of nowhere from a potential squeeze (unlikely I feel, but possible), and imo it's $100 stock with room to grow. 

You could try and time it and save $10/20 per share and get in at the bottom, but I thinking anything sub 90 is a solid adding ground atm. If it spirals down to 20 or something crazy I'd very most likely buy a few hundred shares and sit on them for year or so.

107,SD," I agree with you, but to take somewhat of a Devil's Advocate approach, I could point out some mistakes that Nintendo might have made that Reggie approved of:

1. The Wii U debacle, which could have been avoided even by naming it ""Wii 2"" or something, that resulted in the console failing to become popular.

2. The issues with the rollout of the ""mini"" retro consoles, and how the demand was extremely miscalculated by Nintendo.  I don't know if this is fair to blame Reggie for or not, but he was in charge during this.

3. The approval of the Switch Joycons, despite widespread reports of defective controllers.  This is most likely the fault of people in Japan, but Reggie might have been able to do something differently.

4. Nintendo's terrible online presence for gaming.  This one is also likely the fault of people in Japan, but the fact is Nintendo is pretty much the only mainstream video game company left where buying physical games is better than buying digital games.  For example, if I upgrade from an XBox One to an XBox Series S or X, I'm going to be able to easily transfer my digital games to the new console.  PS4 to PS5 is similar.  Apart from the Wii to WiiU (which was a bit complicated and involved SD cards and such) Nintendo never has a way to address this.  Even the scenario of moving digital games between two of the same console in the event one fails, and other such scenarios, is terrible on Nintendo consoles.

All this being said, I do think there are things that Reggie did well, but I also don't think bringing him on board is a slam dunk in any sense.  He improves the odds in favor of GameStop but I don't think he's any sort of guarantee of success.  At least for me, his presence does tip things somewhat in the favor of GameStop existing, but not enough for me to invest a large amount of money in the company.  

Personally, I am going to wait and see whether they're a good long term investment or not once the current craze is over, and once we're further along in the vaccination process to see what the impacts are on brick and mortar stores.  If I were giving them unsolicited advice, I'd probably suggest they do something crazy like partner with Arcade1Up on some really interesting hardware, or even see about trying to get some partnership with chains like Chuck E.

136,GME," I need help understanding the short interest concept. I tried posting but the automod removed it and asked me to post it here. 

So this question is based on the GME stock. I have already sold all my positions, so this is not for personal monetary gain. Just trying to understand the various financial concepts - I'm new to investing. 

Let's say for simplicity sake that 100 shares of GME are owned by 100 shareholders. Now the shorts borrow all 100 shares and sell it in the market again which is purchased by 100 new shareholders. Essentially, two shareholders are now sharing one ""real"" stock. Based on the actual number of shares released by the company, the short interest would be 100%.  But would this matter when the shorts are trying to cover? It seems to me like what would matter is the actual number of shares that have been sold and are available in the market held by all shareholders (200 shares).

What is the actual benefit to owning stocks besides my ability to sell it later for (hopefully) more than I paid for it? I mean, does owning a piece of a company actually *mean* anything? Shouldn't I get dividends on profits or the ability to vote on company policy or anything like that?  


If the ONLY use for holding stock in a company is to basically abandon it (ie: sell it off) when that company is at it's most profitable then how does it even have any inherent value?

I have approx. $5.000 which I want to invest. My time horizon is long-term, so I don't need the money in the next 15-20 years. I'm 30, from Germany and I would like to invest in ecological firms at best. I'm an engineer myself and I just like the thought of helping firms working environmentally friendly or ones that just help people. I heard about H2 companies like Ballard (Canada), Nel ASA from Denmark (I suppose) and a psilocybin (meds made out of fungi for depression amongst others) company from the US or Canada called HAVN Life Sciences, whose stock is about 75 cents, which to me sounds like a classic penny stock. Still, the risk isn't that high and since it's a long-term investment and the company just started operating, also H2 is just rising to become a better known or more oftenly used technology: would you support me if I'd invest all the money in those (or maybe two more from those) industries? I have an income of 3000 Euro per month after tax and the invested money is for nothing really special, just an investment in the future.

156,GME," Hi all,

I am just a poor uni student currently working as an intern and I'm trying to save up a little nest egg for myself. I don't really want to jump on any bandwagon. I got FOMO'd into buying GME (shameful, ik), but I don't even have one full share, so even if it goes to zero I'll be alright. I am not enjoying this wild ride though and would prefer to get slower but more consistent gains :)

I read a book called ""A random walk down Wall Street"" and the main takeaway I got from it, is that investing in simple index funds is more or less a foolproof strategy over the long term.

For the past few months I have been paying into a Socially Responsible portfolio using the Nutmeg app (I'm in the UK). I'll attach a table with a list of investments included there. I have a bit of money saved in that account, but since it's essentially just a bunch of ETFs behind a nice app, I was wondering if I would be better off picking just one or two ETFs myself and just leaving them to do their thing instead.

I have an account on Trading 212 and I was looking at the iShares Core S&P500 USD (CSPX) and the iShares Global Clean Energy (INRG) funds. I'd like to invest in those two with a 75%/25% split. I can put in around £600 a month.

Is now a good time to be putting money into those funds? Maybe I would be better sticking with Nutmeg? I'd love to hear your opinions and advice. 

Thank you all in advance!

166,GME," I am 34 yo and living in the US. I am employed, but as a graduate student. I have generally worked multipe part time jobs before graduate school. I did have a one year stint before grad school as an editorial assistant in an advertising firm, which was the highest paying job (\~40k) I ever had. Now, I am only making \~17k a year. My objectives are to buy a house (I don't know, I have sort of given up building retirement savings at this point). My risk tolerance is very low because I have so little money anyway - I am really scared to lost it. I have a retirement account through Fidelity for a part time job I held for a while, which has $20k savings in it. Other than that I have $2k in my savings account. I am usually living paycheck to paycheck and rarely getting money into my savings account.

&#x200B;

Luckily, the only debt I have is my used car loan, of which I think about 5-6k remain on the loan.

&#x200B;

I am a disabled trans person who has usually given up on ever making money or living well because I have a lot of medical expenses. It wasn't until all of this GME hit the news that I became interested (and also amazed) that random people could just buy stocks like that. I made a brokerage account on Fidelity, but have no idea what's going on, so I just look at it and scroll through the various options they provide. I also have generally thought that messing with the stock market means losing money, because it's like gambling. And I am very adverse to gambling, so if I ever do get extra money I put it in my savings account. 

&#x200B;

With the stimulus money we might be getting, I want to put that in my savings account too.

&#x200B;

I am looking for any advice how to get started with all this to make my dream happen of having enough to buy a house one day. I don't expect that to happen anytime soon and have generally expected I will have to rent forever.

I’m a bit new to investing in general. I have some decent savings, I make about 20k a year (I just graduated college, still living at home while I try and find a big boy job).

I’m planning on using M1 Finance and creating a diversified yet aggressive portfolio to max out my roth IRA.

In the meantime, I have about a few grand in savings that I wish to keep rather liquid and not put in a IRA because it’s my rainy day fund. But I also want to combat inflation.

Is there anywhere I can put my savings that would can be easily accessed with no penalty which helps me combat or at least move with inflation?

184,AAPL," Hi guys, first time posting to /r/investing.  I've lurked for a bit, but until a recent promotion, haven't had TONS of disposable income due to my previous savings goals / budget.  Anyhow, I'm just looking for thoughts on how to build wealth over time.  I'm not looking for a 'get rich quick' scheme, but more of a methodical approach where every few years I can take on a major house project (ie in a few months we have to drop 30k on roof/siding).  I'm probably not talking 'make 30k profit in a few years' but 5-10k profit would be super helpful.  Anyhow, about me....  
  
  
-  38 living in the US  
-  Employed, household income after promotion will be ~150k  
-  Objectives listed above.  Slow and steady growth.  
-  Time horizon years.  I have a 401k in target funds (2045) and small portion (under 10%) in TIPS.    
-  Risk Tolerance is moderate.  As long as I'm employed, we're fine.  Given I work in Tech, we're often laid off first so I don't want to be TOO risky, but I don't want to have little to no returns either.  
-  Debts - ~10k Mortgage, ~10k Student Loans  
-  Current Holdings FNILX ~11,5 FZILX ~3,1 AAPL ~12,5 401k Retirement accounts(me+wife) ~365k, 529 ~18k, Cash 40-50 after roof and siding gets done
  
So that's my financial background and I apologize it's so long.  I'm thinking with the promotion I'll have an additional 500-900 a month in income after maxing my 401k and the wife's ira along with upping my FNILX and FZILX contributions by 25-50.  Should I just up those funds further and toss an extra $100-200 on AAPL a month?  I'm honestly pretty lost.  Or at this point does it make more sense to see a financial advisor?

Also I have a good science base knowledge (biology/healthcare sciences), so was thinking of looking into biotech and pharma, but I'm aware there is much more at play when picking investments than understanding the principles behind behind what the companies offer.

196,GME," So I recently made some money on this whole GME thing, nothing crazy, but definitely life changing to say the least. Anyway after Robinhood pulled that shit, that's when I pulled out and went to Fidelity. I started a transfer and everything, and now I have some fears. 

I never had margin investing enabled on robinhood, ever. But the transfer just hit my Fidelity and it says it's all on margin, but I'm still able to withdraw my funds. Also Robinhood didn't transfer all of my assets and they took out more than what I had in my available balance. I don't mind putting up the money since you know I never even had this kind before, but I feel like this is an error on their end. 

I got suspicious, so I started going back even before the GME trade and it's saying everything was I traded was on margin, and I wish to express this plain and simple, I literally never had margin enabled. I felt like that was an area I didn't know enough about, and so that's why I'm reaching out here. Any advice or something to ease my concerns would be immensely appreciated.

198,GME," This is more a question around broader trading law than investment, but I thought this would be a neutral thread to ask in away from all the madness - various folks over on WSB have seemingly proven that the information being published over the last couple of days relating to Melvin's short position on GME is demonstrably false. On top of that, various articles have appeared stating that Reddit has gone all-in for silver, which a cursory look around the subreddits involved also confirms is entirely made up clickbait - maybe a silver rally is indeed happening on the back of last week's events, but it's certainly not being driven by viral upvoting of the kind last week's rallies were, which is what many articles claimed yesterday.

My question is this: In the context of the laws around using misinformation to manipulate the market, particularly those which have been repeatedly cited over the last week in relation to the hammers which the SEC may try to bring down upon the Reddit communities pushing the GME rally, how is it even remotely legal for media organisations to publish information which seems not only to be merely unlikely speculation, but *demonstrably* false information?

This obviously assumes that the information around (a) Melvin's short interest in GME having plummeted is indeed false, and (b) the silver rally not being driven by Reddit, but by other factors. Of course, it's possible that those commentating on it here have got it entirely wrong.

Assuming the reports in the media are indeed untrue, however, what I'm curious about is how that's legally distinct from an ""average joe"" internet user posting the same kind of untrue rumours, in that the latter is being cited this week as a legitimate concern for Redditors being pursued by the SEC, but the confidence the media is displaying in running these stories indicates no such worries on their part, about potential repercussions from the SEC?

I apologise if there's an obvious answer to this which should have jumped out at me. I did wonder if it might be a first amendment issue in which the media has somewhat more wiggle room than a bunch of random internet users, but I honestly don't know enough about the law on misleading the market.",hatrickpatrick,1,/r/investing/comments/lasayz/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/glpx2s6/,0.052,0.857,0.091,0.939

210,DD," Maybe  this is a beginner question, maybe it isn't. People have asked this  question before, I don't doubt. I'm less sure that anyone has  conclusively answered it, though.

I'm a beginner at this. Like a lot of people, I became interested in the stock market in the wake of the current GME drama; ""I've learned more about the stock market in the last week than I have in my entire life!""  That's what everyone's saying right about now, right? But current events aside, as a long-term disabled person who can't work any kind of  regular job, I'm finding that stocks - normal, sensible stocks, not like  the absolute batshit nonsense that's happening in *some other* investing subreddits right now - tickle my brain *just so,*  and I'm wondering if I could actually do this as a regular Thing™. I  can even do it from home! It's very easy and accessible to me. I enjoy  the process of researching companies and industries and reading other  folks' DD. It's fascinating! I could really sink my teeth into this, I  think.

However, my question is this: **How possible is it to make money from trading stocks while being ethical at the same time?**

For  example, I'm interested in BOOHOO. Their stocks are, at the current  time, quite affordable to me in that I'd be able to pick up a worthwhile  number of them without having to overstretch, and they're clearly  undervalued. The reason their share price is in the toilet, though, is  because news keeps coming out about slave wages and inhumane working  conditions and other unsavoury business, and although I have absolutely  no doubt whatsoever that I could turn a good profit if I bought in right  now, *do I really want to?* On a  matter of principle, do I really want BOOHOO in my portfolio, knowing  what I do about their practices?

217,PS," Hi guys,
I just got into investing a few months ago. I started with ETFs (Msci World & Clean energy) because I wanted to put money there in the long term.
Just for fun I bought 4 amc and 20 Nokia stocks and a few dogecoins.. As I said just for fun.

I have a few euros at a disposal. But the money just 'stands' there. I just want some Tipps for how to invest this money. (5000 euros) 

Few more information:
I live in germany
I am 21 years old
A have a bank account with 1,500 euros just for living, and another 3000 at another disposal (but that money is just for hyper safety)
I have an apprenticeship and started to study this year at an university. I also have a job which is paying me 450 euros every month.
100 euros of those are going in a managed fond and those ETFs. 
20 euros are for the gym
30 euros are for my brain (books, workshops..)
300 are for living. Maybe I could spare another 50 euros, but I have to calculate that. 

Because I want to put the most part of my money into long term investments, do you guys have any ideas? I don't want trading to be such a big part of my live, that's why I choose ETFs.

I heard much about Nvidia and technology in general. But shouldnt I put money in more different 'categories' like crypto, gold...?

I just wanna reach financial freedom. I don't want to think about if I can afford this pizza and want to give Ppl that supported me something back :)

237,IMO," What I do is called the 3 fund portfolio. This allocates 70% to VTI, 20% to VXUS, and 10% to BND. This allows me to be very well hedged and minimally exposed to any one sector. It completely removes unsystematic risk, as it’s very diversified. Overall, IMO this is probably the best “set it and forget it” portfolio. On top of that, it’s not actively managed, so the tax burden is lower.

245,RH," It could just be accounting? Like, when you buy something, the money doesn’t directly go from your account to the seller’s account.

Fidelity may be using its money to buy, and then you pay them back. So it shows up temporarily as “margin”. Your funds may not have left your account yet but will soon.

For example, say I have roughly $10k available to invest. It shows up as money market. 

If I buy $2k worth of stock, my money market stays at $10k, but my margin will show -$2k. 

In a couple of days, when funds transfer from me to the broker, the money market will show as $8k and the margin will show as 0.

If you need to know the exact amount you have available, you can look for the “cash & sweep vehicle”. That shows you the net.

[Edit: incidentally, if you understand this, you might understand what RH is now claiming.

If they paid no dividend the shares would rise to $1070, the total return on your investment is the same.  Dividend yield has almost nothing to do with how much money you will make.

There is no intrinsic benefit to dividends, vs a balanced mix of dividend and growth.  If anything, a group of companies that pays such high dividends seems unhealthy, with nothing invested in growth they may be in their twilight years.

284,ALL," Definitely read terms and understand what you're agreeing to when you open a margin account.  Most margin accounts are subject to a hypothecation agreement covering ALL securities in the account.

Brokerages WILL lend securities in margin accounts to short sellers.  If the originating securities owner (you) wants to sell the broker sells the same security from its own account and pays you, OR if it does not own a large enough position+your position to cover the trade it borrows shares from another brokerage, if it can't do that it will call the short position to get the stock back.  Mind that a hypothecation agreement DOES NOT relinquish your control of the security or rights to profits generated from its sale, so the broker is liable to execute the transaction per your direction regardless of how the underlying security has been collateralized into other loans.

This situation is relatively less common though, more often your broker just uses the securities you pledge as collateral when buying on margin as collateral in another trade to get better rates.  I.e. you buy 100 shares of something on margin and those 100 shares are collateral on the margin you used, your broker can use the 100 shares you have as collateral against your margin as the collateral in sale of a covered call.  You ought to think about securities _from the brokers perspective_ as fully fungible.  If the broker owns 10,000 shares, and has 50,000 additional shares pledged to it as collateral from margin accounts (random numbers but whatever), from the brokers perspective it has 60,000 shares to trade on.  The broker is still responsible to settle any position from the collateralized shares so they are only going to look into low risk, eek out a few points sort of options to get better rates or small premiums on things.",pWheff,3,/r/investing/comments/lasayz/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/glqt8y5/,0.016,0.84,0.143,0.9807

Mind that a hypothecation agreement DOES NOT relinquish your control of the security or rights to profits generated from its sale, so the broker is liable to execute the transaction per your direction regardless of how the underlying security has been collateralized into other loans.

This situation is relatively less common though, more often your broker just uses the securities you pledge as collateral when buying on margin as collateral in another trade to get better rates.  I.e. you buy 100 shares of something on margin and those 100 shares are collateral on the margin you used, your broker can use the 100 shares you have as collateral against your margin as the collateral in sale of a covered call.  You ought to think about securities _from the brokers perspective_ as fully fungible.  If the broker owns 10,000 shares, and has 50,000 additional shares pledged to it as collateral from margin accounts (random numbers but whatever), from the brokers perspective it has 60,000 shares to trade on.  The broker is still responsible to settle any position from the collateralized shares so they are only going to look into low risk, eek out a few points sort of options to get better rates or small premiums on things.",pWheff,3,/r/investing/comments/lasayz/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/glqt8y5/,0.016,0.84,0.143,0.9807

290,GME," This doesn't answer your question, but a piece of advice:

I started in a similar situation to you (except I've got in at a lower price). When the price skyrocketed I've sold a significant fraction of my shares. That way I was basically even (I wouldn't lose money even if GME dropped to $5). I was too greedy to sell everything, and I didn't want to get off the wild ride to $800 or whatever.

Interesting thing is, when I bought in I've made a plan when and how many shares to sell, and I didn't follow it as closely as I should. If I did, I would earn more playing last week's GameStop casino game.

TLDR: when you deal with crazy volatile stock like this that will crash suddenly, decide your price targets before getting in and sell while the price is still going up.

In your case I advice you to sell your stock soon (or at least reduce your exposure). $100 is nowhere near the bottom. Maybe set a sell order for a bit higher price than it is now, to shave some dollars off the volatility.",toki450,9,/r/investing/comments/lb0zio/risk_mitigation_how_can_i_soften_the_blow/glri07i/,0.07,0.826,0.103,0.7501

Speculative plays include things like IPOs, SPACs, etc. They can also include items like Gamestop, AMC or Blackberry. 

Having a dedicated allocation of your portfolio to take on these items offers multiple benefits:

1. If the play finds support at zero, its a maximum of 5% across my account.

2. Since this 5% total is between any of my new or speculative stocks, it limits exposure overall (e.g. a blend of GME, AMC, BB, + CCIV, IPOE) limits your risk as opposed to dedicating all 5% to one play.

If a speculative item does well and I start to gather more data to support my position on it (e.g. understand what the company is actually doing/their roadmap, their customers/contracts, and sector risks; hard data/math: volatility, geometric mean, Sharpe/Sortino ratios) I consider adding it to my core portfolio (purchasing more and elevating it out of ""speculative"" status). 

Once added to my core portfolio, it becomes something that I purchase on a regular cadence (e.g. every pay period I purchase my core portfolio).

295,GME," I would absolutely NOT increase your exposure. You will just be exposing yourself to further losses. You are suggesting doubling down and buying 10k in shares at $20. This stock was worth $3 not very long ago. You could end up losing over 20k in total. Are you comfortable with that?

It's possible that there will be a rebound (even if it is short-lived); maybe the true ""squeeze"" will happen (I doubt this). Unless you need the rest of your investment, you could let it ride - after all, you made a highly volatile bet, and hopefully, you were prepared to lose it all. 

If the remaining $4,000 is important to preserve, then you can cut your losses now. The stock very well may continue to plummet. There is no way to know. The WSB crowd is not open to any facts that do not conform to their theory (including the fact that it appears that short interest has fallen significantly). The entire theory also overstates that % ownership of GME by retail investors. WSB holding shares has not stopped 50-100 million people trading the shares daily - in other words, there are many opportunities for shorts to cover their positions, without WSB selling. There are many other actors here, including hedge funds and big institutional players that have made billions from this.

However there seems to be heavy volatility in the GME stock still which lends itself to recovering some money. We're just buying every dip, selling when it gains a few percentage points repeatedly.

329,IMO," IMO, the large funds that cannot be squeezed except at a stratospheric price took over the position of Melvin Capital and other smaller funds (either by shorting themselves after others closed their positions or perhaps as part of that so-called ""bailout""). The same swap played out I bet in many cases as the newer WSB members bought out the older ones at the top...whether they post their gains or not. 

As far as the mechanics, I imagine if you are Citadel or Bridgewater or somebody with deep pockets, you can take a large short position but hold onto a decent number of shares that you can sell into any insane spike. Say you know you are solvent up to $10,000 per share. If the squeeze ever reaches its zenith and gets near there, you just keep selling shares at $9,999. If you had a million shares, that'd be $10 billion of buy orders that the ""retail army"" would be unable to muster. Eventually these shares will go back to $5 but if you have 20 million shares sold short at $300, it works out in your favor. 

It was always going to happen that the small hedge funds would lose to the big ones that can weather any storm and the new retail investors would fund the gains of the old retail investors:

They will also give you the ""investment thesis"" that they are promoting; ie why they believe in the company.  You are going to want to either prove or disprove that thesis to yourself.  So then I would go to either yahoo finance or google finance and see what is being written about the company.  You can follow or set up google alerts for writers who cover companies or industries you are interested in, as well as ticker based google alerts.  Then, seekingalpha has some good writers (and some not so good).  A lot of that is behind a pay wall, but it's a good way to get started and get ideas.  For BRMK, I found out about it from a writer on seekingalpha named Brad Thomas.  He is a real estate developer turned analyst, and gives some good insight.

The other thing, just in general, is that I personally like REITs for investing.  The dividend makes all the difference and with BRMK they just raised it, so I'm getting about 8% (annual) in monthly installments while I wait for the market to realize what a great company it is!  They plan on raising the dividend to $.10 per share per month eventually but got derailed a bit by covid.  But even more well known tickers like O and NNN still pay about 4.6% and 5.2% respectively.  They are more well known and more stable, but the real upside to me is in the smaller less well known companies.  BRMK will be large enough to make it onto the radar of some of the funds who should in the end bid the div down to about 5%.  So if they get to $.10/share/month and yield about 5%, that's a $24 share price (if they stick around 7% yield it's roughly $17 share price).  I'm thinking it could be a couple years to get there.

447,DD," One thing people have to learn is just because MSM is wrong, doesn't mean the conspiracy theories are right. A lot of the time both sides are just spewing narratives that are likely bullshit. MSM does have some limitations for pushing narratives unlike conspiracies but both can be significantly wrong. 

In regards to the markets, the MSM is pretty much useless and so is WSB once things reach meme status. Most publications are just there to get you to watch/read them for entertainment since there is no incentive for them to give out good info. Nobody is keeping track of anything and nobody is watching them keep track even if they are. There might be some interviews every now and then of interests but overall, the whole thing is just a show. WSB has thousands of different opinion about every things most of the time since it's mostly an aggregate of people with variable levels of knowledge. Mostly the sub just piles on what ever is going up at the moment, so it really is like a skewed momentum index. Every now and then there is some reasonable DD tho.

There is some decent DD on WSB but you need to filter them yourself and also just ignore the pumping when stuff is already going up significantly, the FOMO is useless. The sub lends itself to be driven by FOMO but by the time it really gets going, most of the money is made. 

My personable theory is, contrary to popular narrative, WSB is unlikely to be able to make much difference to any stock movements, the institutions watching WSB posts are probably buying before the pump really gets going and selling to them once stock is already up. Before a pump gets going is when WSB is most divided and there is no way people with so many different opinions will be able to move the hundreds of millions of dollars needed into 1 stock to move it, people posting millions in gains are still small fry compared to institutions who are able to move billions. Institutions can watch WSB and start moving money in before narrative is set and then wait for the users to pile on due to FOMO. Even tho WSB doesn't have enough money initially when they are all divided, institutions can however unload on the millions of WSB users once there is a clear narrative to buy since now, WSB's aggregate user base is much more aligned thus there is enough money on the table to actually be worth while.",oversitting,2,/r/investing/comments/laxjqf/the_quality_of_information_on_the_internet_and/glry1qg/,0.054,0.866,0.08,0.9002

468,ETN," It's a mortgage REIT. High dividend and little (if any) share price growth until something negative happens and then the shares get absolutely obliterated (see March 2020, 2008.)  Many of these are also externally managed so you're paying a fee.

In this case it appears to be: 

“Management Fee” means the base management fee, without duplication, payable quarterly in arrears with respect to each calendar quarter following the Closing Date (or part thereof that this Agreement is in effect), in the amount equal to the greater of:

(a) $250,000 per annum ($62,500 per quarter); and

(b) 1.50% per annum (0.375% per quarter) of the Company’s Equity.

If I had to own an mREIT I'd own Starwood Property given management but otherwise I have no interest in owning mortgage REITs. It's one thing to own a portfolio of data centers and have the thesis behind that; I have no thesis for a portfolio of random mortgages. Can these bounce further? Sure, but they're never going to offer great share price returns. It's a high yield until something happens like in March and then these get obliterated and in many cases the dividend is suspended. There was an article in the WSJ about people who sadly lost a fortune in March 2020 chasing yield with the 2X mREIT ETN, which lost an enormous amount and then had a redemption by the issuer, locking in losses (https://www.wsj.com/articles/bankrupt-in-just-two-weeksindividual-investors-get-burned-by-collapse-of-complex-securities-11591020059)",dvdmovie1,3,/r/investing/comments/lamz1y/trtx_seems_like_a_good_deal_right_now_what_am_i/glpnl9t/,0.121,0.768,0.111,-0.6945

Keep in mind the 10 years can’t really be compared to a VC which may operate in a cyclical 3-10 year lifespan. With Crowdcube it’s a slow trickle of companies over that period, and they usually capture companies at earlier stages meaning the exit timescale may be longer.

I don't understand this part of your logic. While VC's hope for long term IPO's they plan for a secondary purchase or a liquidation. Their exit timeline should be comparable to a VC or Angel Fund. 

> It also seems that this platform isn’t an alternative to VC funding, but complimentary. Lots of companies are using the platform to top up investment from VC’s to reach optimum capital requirement. 

This is interesting, not because i think it is useful to investment or a company, but usually VC's require newer investors to buy them out before receiving any new funding.
