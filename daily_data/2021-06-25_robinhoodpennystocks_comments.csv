With a conservative PT of 30-40$ market cap of 5B you think that you are late?

FYI

For those thinking that 30-40$ price range is not possible I would like to remind them that Gilead offered 20B for a buyout recently for Trodelvy and I can consider this as a peak. 5B market cap or even 10B buyout offer is totally reasonable as if I remember Trodelvy covers about 10% of breast cancer types where ATOS drug covers about 62% if I am not mistaken.
