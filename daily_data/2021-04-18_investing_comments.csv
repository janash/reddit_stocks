Imagine going through all the effort of looking at fundamentals, doing technical analysis, and other forms of DD, just to be told, and empirically shown (odds are _you_ won't beat the market), that the optimal investment strategy is so easy that someone with relatively little investment knowledge could do it by putting all their funds in a basic three fund portfolio, or if they're just saving for retirement then a single TDF",en_be,62,/r/investing/comments/mt2tfk/investing_styles_part_1_jack_bogle_and_common/guyp2mz/,0.038,0.858,0.104,0.7133

2,GME," Vanguard is the best way to learn about investing. The mantra is to keep cost low and diversify. The strategy is easy to beat, since the amount of diversification is literally buying every stock and every bond. One downside to this strategy that is seldom covered accurately is that it is a horrible way to allocate capital.  Maybe you don't want to invest in Fox News, or CNN, tobacco, oil, guns. Vanguard and broad index portfolios would have you invest in everything. Since companies are buying back their own shares it creates a weird feedback loop along with the massive inflow from passively managed fund families.   

The assumption here is that markets are fairly priced and efficient. GME, Bitcoin, TSLA, Coin. 

Does anyone want to short GME with me for 7 days starting on 4/20 buyback on 4/27? Sell the stock to make the price go down, and continue to do so for one week, make sure to tell your friends to do the same. Lets see if we cant get GME back down to $50 in a week.  Make a buck or two and help the markets stay efficient. I just love price discovery, #cough market manipulation #.  I dont like the stock at $154. Seems overvalued.  Is this type of market manipulation? Is it illegal? The SEC doesnt know, and neither do I?  

This is not investment advise. I m an not an advisor. Please be aware that investment can lose lots of money, the potential loss from shorting a company is infinite.  you can limit the loss by buying deep out of the money call options to hedge the risk. Make sure the options dont expire before you cover the short position. Manage your delta hedge. I dont own shares of GME as of today. I am not short GME shares as of today. Standard Disclosure about being an idiot and investing in a security  without knowing the risk involved. Please acknowledge if you are an idiot.  

The second assumption to index investing, is that investors are rational and not idiots.

9,DM," I replied to a comment from a moderator who in so many words said anyone investing in ARK is clueless and is just a trend/meme follower. Essentially a blanket statement writing it off as part of a strategy. 

All I did was say I disagree and that a tilt towards growth, as long as you understand the risk, is in my opinion still following a mostly bogleheads philosophy and that I don't see anything wrong with it. This is personal finance/investing after all. 

Devolved from there, including calling me names in a since edited comment. That I can do what I want but I'm not a boglehead with a 5% allocation to a high growth ETF.  I disagreed and stated that there's many ways to invest and it doesn't need to be all or nothing. 

Que superiority complex with him creating that sub and that I don't know what I'm talking about. From there it was DMs with choice words back and forth. He used his moderator wand to temporarily ban me for ""attacking"" him in DMs all while he ironically started with the condescending words and edited comment to begin with, including condescending words via DM. 

Long story short I wasn't going to back down from defending my opinion re: 95% bogleheads vs 100% and he didn't like it. Used moderator powers and banned me.

18,IMO," IMO value investing is the safest and most tried and true method of making consistent returns. If you change your principles you are no longer a value investor, you are something else entirely. 

The original question you seem to be asking is is value investing obsolete? My response is no, absolutely not. Just because the market has acted a certain way in the past year or two does not mean value investing is not viable anymore, that idea goes against the principles of value investing entirely. Can you make better returns doing something else? Sure you can, but you'll be taking on a lot more risk.

In the next 20 years you will see good companies grow consistently, no matter what happens in between now and then. That is the principle of value investing and that will not ever change unless the world's economy collapses for good and in that scenario investing will be the least of your concerns.",crodensis,2,/r/investing/comments/mtihd4/long_term_investing_value_investing/gv0d906/,0.075,0.749,0.176,0.9208

34,ON," #   HOW THE HELL DO YOU KEEP FROM PANICKING ON FALSE DIPS/JUMPS?! 

So, like a large number of people recently, I've been watching few things and a few other coins like a  Hawk the last few days.

And  since I've started using a Squeeze Wave Oscillator an a few other  Indicators, I've been able to call EVERY SINGLE Major Dip and jump on  the 5 and 15 Min candles.

I'm not saying  that to brag or saying I'm some amazing Trader. I'm not.

In Fact, I'm DOWN $1,500 since Wednesday, DESPITE calling them all.

HOW? Easy, I seem to panic at every blasted Bear/Bull Trap signal.

I don't know enough to make the best Trades, but I DO know enough to screw myself over every time.

Does  anyone have any recommendations or Tips for this problem? Is this just a  ""phase"" that everyone goes through? or is there a bigger problem I  should be paying attention to?

I  think the best Advice I've gotten before was ""Stick to your rules"" and I  know I've not been doing that (again, panicking....orz).",TheRealOsamaru,1,/r/investing/comments/mt9aga/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gv0axs5/,0.108,0.798,0.094,-0.5698
35,TD," You should consider thinking more broadly than ""apps"" and look at platforms.  I would suggest that you use the Pareto principle and look for an app that does 80% of what you need well (there is no perfect app).  

The ability to use a desktop for more complicated trades, extensive research, and non-standard products (like foreign exchange) with the same account matters to full time investors.  TD Ameritrade (ThinkOrSwim for desktop) is the platform I use.",Sheeple0123,1,/r/investing/comments/mt9aga/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/guyq4hk/,0.028,0.856,0.116,0.7184
36,TV," Fair enough. Although Tesla seems to run on hype. 

If Apple reveals a prototype, it will boost stock price. However Apple seems to only like product reveals when they are months (as opposed to years) away from a product release. 

I think once Apple leaks or reveals a car prototype there will be a boost for sure. But we could be a year or more away from that point. 

Regardless of the car market, there is an argument that the other lines of business support current valuation, which is another reason why anything tangible coming out of the auto-side of what Apple is doing will boost price. 

I view cars as potentially bigger than the iPod was for Apple. It would generate huge cash flow with Apple TV and App Store since you get a captive (inside car) audience in their ecosystem. 

But I have long exposure to Apple (and leveraging that with many short puts, including deep in the money leaps) so maybe I’m biased...",Chippopotanuse,2,/r/investing/comments/mt9aga/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/guylgzx/,0.019,0.87,0.111,0.9109

I don't know anything about MPW, but just going off of trends in medicine, e-medicine is one the rise and a psychologist for example is able to conduct sessions online now.
