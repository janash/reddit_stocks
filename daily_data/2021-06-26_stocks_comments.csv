9,IP," PSTH. (Ackman’s SPAC that’s going to own 10% of UMG *before* its IPO in Q3.)

UMG owns one-third of the music IP on the planet. The revenue is growing, the margins are growing (from a shift from lower-margin physical media to higher-margin streaming), and it’s expanding into emerging markets that have a fraction of the smartphone and streaming penetration of developed countries. UMG’s next closest competitor is 10 points behind it in market share, and UMG controls 10 out of the 10 highest-grossing artists worldwide.

PSTH shareholders get a pro forma ownership in UMG, plus (since Ackman isn’t using all of the SPAC’s cash for this transaction) another company yet unknown (""Remainco""), plus dibs on Ackman’s next instrument, called a SPARC. The SPARC is similar to a SPAC, except no investment is required upfront. I call it a retrospective investment, since SPARC will allow shareholders to invest at a predetermined price *after* the target has been identified.

NXE is ramping up mining operations next year for uranium. They're planning on a demand increase and I don't think they're wrong. In the US alone, the DOE and DOD are tossing funds at SMR companies for new designs or unique nuclear energy applications (think portable reactors for remote energy or heat production, new reactor designs, etc.), on new fuel designs (TRISOs, etc.), and even construction of new plants (NuScale SMRs for UAMPs). I feel very strongly that the nuclear industry is on a precipice of a massive revival due to the high density energy that can be produced 24/7, unlike with renewables.",kittiquel,1,/r/stocks/comments/o81utw/favorite_stocks_for_the_next_5_years_that_arent/h33i5tb/,0.04,0.855,0.105,0.8673

I feel they've figured out how to battle the retail apocalypse, mixed use.  They are primarily in the NE, they are A quality malls.  In some cases, they are the last mall standing in the area.  4 or 5 years ago they started to change up how they do business, and they hit .30 during the pandemic.

Do big banks count as FinTech? (JPM, MS - low P/E, nice dividend. Smart leadership).

248,KKR," As with other retailers like Sears, etc., when ASO was acquired by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. (KKR), the firm didn't actually pay for the company; the purchase ""price"" was taken out as debt leveraged against the company.  Ten years later, of 2021, ASO is still $300 million in the hole.  ([1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Sports_%2B_Outdoors)) ([2](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/academy-sports--outdoors-announces-99-million-paydown-and-refinancing-of-its-term-loan-and-upgrade-to-credit-rating-301299241.html)).  

$300 million of debt vs. $2.7 billion in annual revenue shouldn't be a huge issue, except that KKR has no incentive to stop looting the company, and they have [an extensive history of doing just that](http://www.stephenhicks.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/forbes-kkr.pdf).

317,GME," I like GME and have a small number of shares, but they still have a ways to go before they're considered a safe company by normal investing standards. Again, I have some, because I believe in the company, kind of want to say ""fuck you"" to the big money boys with my wallet, and like games; but the stock is no where near close to being a sure bet on return.  
  
The fact that GME might briefly jump to the moon due to hedge funds being collective dumbasses isn't an actual indication as to the long term viability of the company. All that new stuff GME has been doing is still new. We don't know if it works yet. New CEO, CFO, NFTs, etc are great but we don't know that it'll make a profit yet, and that's the whole point of a stock, is to invest in a solid company that will keep growing and be around for a long time. Until GME pulls in actual profits off of its businesses for a few years, it's not going to be mainstream, nor should it be. Currently, they might be losing less money on business per quarter, but they're still losing money. They also still have to try and wrestle for market space with steam and amazon, and many companies have tried to compete with both and have failed.  
  
I'm young, I can take a little risk and see where GME goes over the next 10 years. If GME goes to zero, I will say, ""Holy heck was that fun, I have a great story to tell"" and move on. Other people might not be able to take that risk. If someone is tight on money and really NEEDS that invested money to work for them and be there without a shadow of a doubt in 40 years, then GME isn't a safe bet for them. It's the same with an investment that I can't mention on this sub due to autodeletion of any comment with this word in it. It has amazing potential, and I have some money in it, but it's not an investment for the average ""I want the biggest return possible with the least possible risk"" person.",The_PracticalOne,3,/r/stocks/comments/o81utw/favorite_stocks_for_the_next_5_years_that_arent/h357pql/,0.063,0.795,0.142,0.9839

349,IP," Reading through the comments, I feel like you’re being intentionally wrong-headed.

A share of stock is a percentage ownership in a company. This company has intrinsic and extrinsic value, and the stock’s intrinsic and extrinsic value is directly derived from it. For the purposes of this conversation we can remove extrinsic (perceived value) from both sides of the equation.

A stock / company has assets (physical inventory, intellectual assets / IP, cash ) that directly translate into its intrinsic value.

A baseball card’s intrinsic value is the raw material it’s made of.

A company (and by relation, it’s stock) can increase its intrinsic value by making money through providing goods / services, and in doing so acquire more inventory, cash stores, and intellectual IP.

A baseball card cannot increase its intrinsic value, period.

If you cannot see the difference here, I’d recommend never buying stock.",virtxxx,42,/r/stocks/comments/o8a5oa/why_are_stocks_intrinsically_valuable/h3443ms/,0.0,0.765,0.235,0.9837

352,ALL," Nothing. They aren't intrinsically valuable at all. It all operates on a greater fool theory. The ONLY value it has is what you can find some sucker to pay you for it. That's it. You buy a $50,000 car and can't find someone to give you $45,000 for it a year later? OK, but you still have a car that you can drive around. If you can't sell your shares, you'll take a loss or enjoy sitting around thinking about how you have shares.

Theoretically, the company could have $10B in cash with a market cap of $5B. You can't force them to pay you your fair share of that $10B. There's nothing you can do besides find another sucker.

The best part about it though, the part that makes it all work, the reason why my above example is only theoretical and would never happen in real life, is that 99% of people have been bamboozled into thinking that the company's worth IS the intrinsic value. (See most replies here for proof.)

355,GME," A share of stock is literally a share of ownership of the company.  It has value assuming the company itself has value (which it would, unless the company is in bankruptcy.)  

As a part owner of the company, you can vote at the shareholder meeting for the things they put up for a vote, usually things like hiring a new CEO, board of directors, and so on.  One share = one vote.  Now, granted, your one share/vote out of the millions of ""Outstanding Shares"" isn't going to change the direction of the company, especially if the founder of the company retains more than 50% of the shares, which they usually do.  

The total price of all the outstanding shares is known as the ""Enterprise Value"".  This is what the stock market thinks that company is worth.  If the company is *actually* worth more than that (which can be a highly subjective judgement that even the pros get wrong sometimes) then the stock would be considered ""undervalued"" and therefore a good buy.  And the opposite is true.

The job of the stock market is to provide ""liquidity"".  At any point in time, you will be able to buy or sell your stock at the current market price.  (You might not *like* the current market price, but that's another story.)  The stock market does this by continuously adjusting the price of the stock until buyers and sellers are equal.  So if everybody sells and nobody is buying, the price will crash down until people start buying.  (You saw this in March 2020 when Covid first hit.)  And the reverse is true:  If everybody is buying and nobody is selling, the price will shoot up TO THE MOON!!! until people start selling.

While a company could cut their dividends,.it would generally not be in the Executives best interest because Executives generally have vested shares.

All this crap about ""the stock represents a piece of the company and therefore has value"" doesn't mean shit. Like that sentence literally doesn't mean anything. I'm sick of reading it. Aside from the dividend OR the belief that someone else will come and buy the stock from yoy for more in the future, there is zero reason to own a stock. Stop this ""your shares represent a stake of the companies value"" yea no shit that's the definition of a stock. That doesn't explain why it has value or why I would want to buy it. 

And yes there are some stocks that do not pay dividends where the ceo has publicly announced that it will NEVER pay dividends. I don't buy those stocks.

There’s a name for this like privatisation hypothesis (probably not this name exactly) or something like that. Similarly, if a company becomes too overvalued, they can just issue shares (similar to AMC/Gamestop case)

Gamestop was **never** worth $20,000 (going with your example), and the increase in share price doesn't change its real valuation. It still has the same $3000 worth of assets, which does not change with the stock price. A little more than what the stock level suggested because of the short selling, and a lot less than what it suggests with the overinflated price.

The overinflated price of $200, suggesting $20,000 value, represents a bubble that will in time pop, causing the price per share to plummet. And *for the most part*, this all doesn't affect the day to day of GameStop stores or employees.

They are not by default intrinsically valuable.  Valid arguments are that you can accumulate enough to sway voting decisions, you can collect dividend, you can expect stock buy back, you can expect company buy outs.

That's completely ignoring 30 years of growth AND ignoring dividend raises along the way. Which brings me to my next point:
2. Dividend raises. There are companies that have RAISED THEIR DIVIDEND EVERY YEAR FOR OVER 60 YEARS. Coca Cola (KO) was trading for $6 a share back in 1991 and had 3 splits since then. Today each share is up roughly 700%, you would have 6 times as many shares, and you would have been collecting dividends the whole time. KO now pays $1.68 per year, per share.

375,IMO," Personally, I'm not a fan of dividend stocks unless you're heading towards retirement age and want the extra income/reduced risk.

Most dividend stocks are from stable companies that have a track record of generating cash but their business doesn't grow as much internally. The problem with this is there is a lack of appreciation in stock price and the reason dividends is even issued is to keep investors happy.

If you're not anywhere close to retirement age, IMO, it's preferable to focus on the appreciation of a stock than dividend generating stocks. Reason being is when you're young, you're less likely to generate a significant amount of money from dividends alone due to having less capital. When you're near retirement stage, you should probably think about liquidating some riskier stocks and opt for dividends. $100,000 invested into Verizon would generate roughly $4,500 every year. That's nothing to sneeze at if you're retired. But let's say you are young and only have $10,000 into Verizon, that would only generate $450 every year. If you're young, there is no need to opt for that kind of yield with the better opportunities elsewhere.

376,IMO, IMO dividends are only worth it if your portfolio is at least $1M. With 5% dividend you could at least get a significant amount of fixed income ($50k/year).  I don't get the appeal of receiving an $8 payout with a small portfolio. You might as well just go with quality growth stocks and enjoy the capital appreciation in that case.,VictorDanville,1,/r/stocks/comments/o8akyg/are_dividends_worth_it/h33rjqt/,0.0,0.774,0.226,0.9169

424,ALNY," Hi Friend, 

Rather than doing deep dives I strongly suggest you focus on historic revenue / profit growth and future revenue / profit projections.   These are by far the most reliable indicators of future performance and the easiest to learn.

Projections are extremely important.  They represent the combined knowledge of the ""deep dives"" of several or even dozens of highly trained analysts.   Any one of these analysts may have strong biases that would lead their analysis astray (note the wide spread in projections for many companies).  However, combining their projections into mean and median projections tends to counter the biases and give a moderately reliable indication of future prospects of a company.  And in fact these combined analyses are the standard by which all stocks are judged on earnings day, so it pays to know them.  

Stick to companies with a history of >15% annual revenue growth over the previous five years and the same for the future 1-2 years.  Always look at the 5-10yr price chart.  The last few years at least should be a solid uptrend. 

I suggest before investing you do a stock screen for ""mid cap"" companies with >15% revenue growth over the last five years.  I just did one and it gave 121 companies.  Now look at the 10 year chart for every company.  Set the chart axis to ""Log"".  Make a list of the companies with a strong, solid, continuous 3-5yr uptrend.  This indicates that the company has a product that can drive increasing sales.  

Here are some examples of great charts: PODD, CHGG, RNG, SMAR, PANW, PEN, PAYC

Here are some examples of shitty charts: TAP, APPN, PLAN,  LNG, BMRN, BERY, ATHM

Here are some examples of ""tweeners"": ALNY, ANET, CZR, DBX

The ""tweeners"" are on an uptrend but the ride is pretty wild.  Avoid that until you get more experience.  

Here are two other interesting charts: FATE, ENPH

Look at each with the linear and log axis.  See how changing the axis to log shows you the growth trend better?  With the 10yr chart in linear mode, these look like companies with a wild recent price spike.  With that same chart in log mode, you can see the company has a very strong growth trend.  IMO you should avoid these until you get more experience because they can turn around very rapidly!  But keep an eye on this kind of stock and see how it plays out. 

After you cull out companies by the charts, start looking at the revenue growth.  Cull out the companies with recent downturns or flats.  After that, look at the forward revenue growth.  Choose the companies with the strongest projections.  Then look for a price point - even if you have to wait a month or two - and buy.  Start with small positions ($0.5K-$2K)and work up as you gain confidence.  

Remember that big companies that have made hundreds of billions of dollars for their investors took many decades to reach their current size - don't listen to this bullshit of ""don't follow trends"".  In fact you \*\*MUST\*\* follow trends - at least if you want to be a successful investor.   It's true that ""past performance doesn't guarantee future performance"".  It doesn't guarantee it, but it's the best indication available of future performance.

Here are some examples of great charts: PODD, CHGG, RNG, SMAR, PANW, PEN, PAYC

Here are some examples of shitty charts: TAP, APPN, PLAN,  LNG, BMRN, BERY, ATHM

Here are some examples of ""tweeners"": ALNY, ANET, CZR, DBX

The ""tweeners"" are on an uptrend but the ride is pretty wild.  Avoid that until you get more experience.  

Here are two other interesting charts: FATE, ENPH

Look at each with the linear and log axis.  See how changing the axis to log shows you the growth trend better?  With the 10yr chart in linear mode, these look like companies with a wild recent price spike.  With that same chart in log mode, you can see the company has a very strong growth trend.  IMO you should avoid these until you get more experience because they can turn around very rapidly!  But keep an eye on this kind of stock and see how it plays out. 

After you cull out companies by the charts, start looking at the revenue growth.  Cull out the companies with recent downturns or flats.  After that, look at the forward revenue growth.  Choose the companies with the strongest projections.  Then look for a price point - even if you have to wait a month or two - and buy.  Start with small positions ($0.5K-$2K)and work up as you gain confidence.  

Remember that big companies that have made hundreds of billions of dollars for their investors took many decades to reach their current size - don't listen to this bullshit of ""don't follow trends"".  In fact you \*\*MUST\*\* follow trends - at least if you want to be a successful investor.   It's true that ""past performance doesn't guarantee future performance"".  It doesn't guarantee it, but it's the best indication available of future performance.

426,APPN," Hi Friend, 

Rather than doing deep dives I strongly suggest you focus on historic revenue / profit growth and future revenue / profit projections.   These are by far the most reliable indicators of future performance and the easiest to learn.

Projections are extremely important.  They represent the combined knowledge of the ""deep dives"" of several or even dozens of highly trained analysts.   Any one of these analysts may have strong biases that would lead their analysis astray (note the wide spread in projections for many companies).  However, combining their projections into mean and median projections tends to counter the biases and give a moderately reliable indication of future prospects of a company.  And in fact these combined analyses are the standard by which all stocks are judged on earnings day, so it pays to know them.  

Stick to companies with a history of >15% annual revenue growth over the previous five years and the same for the future 1-2 years.  Always look at the 5-10yr price chart.  The last few years at least should be a solid uptrend. 

I suggest before investing you do a stock screen for ""mid cap"" companies with >15% revenue growth over the last five years.  I just did one and it gave 121 companies.

435,IMO," Hi Friend, 

Rather than doing deep dives I strongly suggest you focus on historic revenue / profit growth and future revenue / profit projections.   These are by far the most reliable indicators of future performance and the easiest to learn.

Projections are extremely important.  They represent the combined knowledge of the ""deep dives"" of several or even dozens of highly trained analysts.   Any one of these analysts may have strong biases that would lead their analysis astray (note the wide spread in projections for many companies).  However, combining their projections into mean and median projections tends to counter the biases and give a moderately reliable indication of future prospects of a company.  And in fact these combined analyses are the standard by which all stocks are judged on earnings day, so it pays to know them.  

Stick to companies with a history of >15% annual revenue growth over the previous five years and the same for the future 1-2 years.  Always look at the 5-10yr price chart.  The last few years at least should be a solid uptrend. 

I suggest before investing you do a stock screen for ""mid cap"" companies with >15% revenue growth over the last five years.  I just did one and it gave 121 companies.  Now look at the 10 year chart for every company.  Set the chart axis to ""Log"".  Make a list of the companies with a strong, solid, continuous 3-5yr uptrend.  This indicates that the company has a product that can drive increasing sales.  

Here are some examples of great charts: PODD, CHGG, RNG, SMAR, PANW, PEN, PAYC

Here are some examples of shitty charts: TAP, APPN, PLAN,  LNG, BMRN, BERY, ATHM

Here are some examples of ""tweeners"": ALNY, ANET, CZR, DBX

The ""tweeners"" are on an uptrend but the ride is pretty wild.  Avoid that until you get more experience.  

Here are two other interesting charts: FATE, ENPH

Look at each with the linear and log axis.  See how changing the axis to log shows you the growth trend better?  With the 10yr chart in linear mode, these look like companies with a wild recent price spike.  With that same chart in log mode, you can see the company has a very strong growth trend.  IMO you should avoid these until you get more experience because they can turn around very rapidly!  But keep an eye on this kind of stock and see how it plays out.

However, combining their projections into mean and median projections tends to counter the biases and give a moderately reliable indication of future prospects of a company.  And in fact these combined analyses are the standard by which all stocks are judged on earnings day, so it pays to know them.  

Stick to companies with a history of >15% annual revenue growth over the previous five years and the same for the future 1-2 years.  Always look at the 5-10yr price chart.  The last few years at least should be a solid uptrend. 

I suggest before investing you do a stock screen for ""mid cap"" companies with >15% revenue growth over the last five years.  I just did one and it gave 121 companies.  Now look at the 10 year chart for every company.  Set the chart axis to ""Log"".  Make a list of the companies with a strong, solid, continuous 3-5yr uptrend.  This indicates that the company has a product that can drive increasing sales.  

Here are some examples of great charts: PODD, CHGG, RNG, SMAR, PANW, PEN, PAYC

Here are some examples of shitty charts: TAP, APPN, PLAN,  LNG, BMRN, BERY, ATHM

Here are some examples of ""tweeners"": ALNY, ANET, CZR, DBX

The ""tweeners"" are on an uptrend but the ride is pretty wild.  Avoid that until you get more experience.  

Here are two other interesting charts: FATE, ENPH

Look at each with the linear and log axis.  See how changing the axis to log shows you the growth trend better?  With the 10yr chart in linear mode, these look like companies with a wild recent price spike.  With that same chart in log mode, you can see the company has a very strong growth trend.  IMO you should avoid these until you get more experience because they can turn around very rapidly!  But keep an eye on this kind of stock and see how it plays out. 

After you cull out companies by the charts, start looking at the revenue growth.  Cull out the companies with recent downturns or flats.  After that, look at the forward revenue growth.  Choose the companies with the strongest projections.  Then look for a price point - even if you have to wait a month or two - and buy.  Start with small positions ($0.5K-$2K)and work up as you gain confidence.  

Remember that big companies that have made hundreds of billions of dollars for their investors took many decades to reach their current size - don't listen to this bullshit of ""don't follow trends"".  In fact you \*\*MUST\*\* follow trends - at least if you want to be a successful investor.   It's true that ""past performance doesn't guarantee future performance"".  It doesn't guarantee it, but it's the best indication available of future performance.

I like seeing debt. Cost of debt is super cheap right now. Fed fund rate is around zero! That's why you see huge companies with tons of cash still issuing debt. If a company has not debt or low debt, that probably means no one wants to lend to them. On the other side, you also don't want to see too much debt! 

Synergy based M&A is when Company A buys Company B for ""synergies"". Most studies on M&A have shown that these ""synergies"" are never realized at scale.

Another is the ability to get a mortgage loan which is a safer form of leverage than margin, but doesn’t really apply here because OP is close to full ownership. Another reason is some people just find it more fun. You can do whatever you want to the property, like renovation projects to increase its value.

If the cars become driverless, that extra margin goes straight to ride sharing services (Uber/Lyft/Waymo).",careful_guy,3,/r/stocks/comments/o8h317/is_google_in_a_position_to_compete_with_uber_and/h34ywmz/,0.011,0.916,0.073,0.8126

545,HR," This isn’t about the tech part of it, any motivated software developers can build the service, the servers don’t even cost that much.

The problem is the liabilities of it, and the background checks on all the drivers, and providing the customer support that requires hiring a large number for people to answer phones, marketing, HR, lawyers, etc",mohelgamal,1,/r/stocks/comments/o8h317/is_google_in_a_position_to_compete_with_uber_and/h354jq8/,0.071,0.819,0.11,0.3612
546,OR," Both Uber and Lyft had massive losses in 2020 - $6B for Uber and $2B for Lyft. They sold their autonomous driving divisions to regain control of their profitability, at least for a short term. Besides, Uber's ATV division was sued by Waymo for trade-secret theft and all. 

I see two course of actions by Uber/Lyft:

1. Focus on profitability in the short-term for next couple of years and then kickstart the ATV division again. OR,

2. Focus solely on ridesharing component, and then partner with Aurora or another ATV-third party startup/company to provide its driverless cars.

My bet it's the second option they will go after, because building autonomous cars are extremely expensive, and not to mention, have potential regulatory issues in the future as well.",careful_guy,2,/r/stocks/comments/o8h317/is_google_in_a_position_to_compete_with_uber_and/h354a01/,0.021,0.91,0.069,0.6486

550,DCF," 1) If you listen closely they'll always ask for LTM revenue, gross margins, owner compensation and profitability (which I believe is typically stated in EBITDA? Maybe pretax?). Then they'll ask for NTM revenue and profitability. 

I believe they capitalize the NTM metrics at a high discount. I'm guessing at least 20. Probably 30-40% range (or higher for some companies). Some industries are easier as they'll commonly sell at a multiple. (Like a book of business generally sells for 1x-1.5x, which is more in my wheelhouse than VC)

The valuations especially for early stage companies are more of a risk exercise than an in depth DCF analysis. 

2) The $1.0 million valuation offered by the entrepreneur in your example is a present value. So the entrepreneur themself with the highest expectations in the world is acknowledging risk with the valuation presented to the sharks. 


3) the moat thing. The company  probably doesn't  need a shark if they have a moat. Or at least, the entrepreneur would be more open to a lower value.

There are a few balance sheet items the sharks do care about. A lot of inventory is usually a bad sign, they're always happier when the investor owns 100% of the company and the company has no third party debt.",StochasticDecay,3,/r/stocks/comments/o83gaj/company_valuation_especially_when_its/h32rdjj/,0.083,0.822,0.096,0.4478

553,AAPL," Wait - are you saying you’ll get assigned just because the put is in the money? Or does it expire on Monday? And do you have the cash available to take assignment?

Even though American options can be assigned as soon as they are ITM, I’ve never had it happen to me. I have been assigned at expiration plenty of times. 

Here’s a bit of my experience:

Selling naked puts OTM:

I sell naked puts all day long. I only write them at prices (after you account for the premium discount to basis) that I’d be fine buying the stock at. 

In the last year, I’ve been assigned:

AAPL at prices between 115-124 (sold all shares profitably or at still holding at a profit on all)

ACB (aurora Cannabis) at 7 (sold all shares for a small profit and then watched it soar to $9..)

CGC (Canopy Growth) at 26 (sold all shares for a small profit)

SPXL (triple leveraged S&P 500 ETF) that I exited two days after assignment for a profit

YOLO (marijuana ETF) that I still hold since it’s about 3% below my costs basis, and I’ll wait a little to see if it goes up)

Coming up on July expirations, I have some ALL (Allstate) at a net assignment price of $131.50 that may or may not get assigned, and about 17 contracts of BGFV (Big 5 - a sporting goods retailer) at net assignment prices of $29.30 and $26.20 I’ll get punched in the mouth with (it is trading at $25.65 now), but I will stick it out for a bit and see how it does like my YOLO etf.

Selling naked puts ITM:

And I wrote in the money naked puts as well. Including Leaps. So, for instance, with AAPL at $132 right now, I recently wrote (on June 14) a January 2022 put with an strike price of $140. But it had a $17.20 premium, which would mean worst case I buy it at $122.80. 

Rolling puts when concerned about assignment:

The other thing I have done is you can roll your put options forward a month or two. Close your current put at a loss, and buy a longer duration put (which will come with a larger premium). Now, this just kicks the can down the road and don’t do this if it’s throwing good money after bad.
