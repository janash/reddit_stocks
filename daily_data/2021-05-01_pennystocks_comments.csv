30,SP," Yes if you are a short term investor (days, weeks) then you should ALWAYS set up a stop loss trailing of some 20% or so.  That way you always secure some gain before the next play.  That is more speculation/ guessing/ gambling though then it is investing..

As a long term investor doesn't really matter though.  Personally, I pick a play where if they hit a clear defined catalyst by end of the year (2021) then it will likely explode.  So short term ups and downs don't bother me only matters if they hit or miss the catalyst.  I have faith though if they do what they are say they will do then the SP has a shot at 10x (no guarantees of course).  If they don't I will lose a lot of that money.

71,PBT," Expanding on the production costs already assumed by the new operator costs for PBT as of April 2020 and the new supply/demand coming online since COVID is decreasing. I wanted to share the EIA visual data I found for the past decade that shows oil output for the region that most of PBT has their leases on.

https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=37532

If I'm correct and costs are already accounted for in the past 12-18 months of dividend the next couple dividends could be a 300-500% increase if oil stays above $55. OPEC+ and Iran are always factors but most countries are still hurting heavily on their national budget for Oil and Gas sales.

I also found a recent news about a natural gas to gasoline plant(Green Energy) that is the first of it's kind going into Pennwell, TX. This is directly adjacent to PBT land and pipeline where PBT produces a large amount of Natural Gas and has been their more profitable point since 2010.

76,ANY," I'm just curious why a person who doubts the stewardship of ANY company would continue to invest in said company.  It is your money and like any shareholder your job is to protect YOUR money.  If you feel the company is not progressing as it should or even worse not being truthful to the OWNERS of the company (shareholders) then you should ""vote with your feet"" and sell and move on.  

My no. 1 rule of investing in ANY stock is you have to believe  1.  In the goal of what the company is trying to do and 2.  The leadership of the company (stewardship).  Investing in any stock is like starting a relationship.  You start out dating and you review periodic if you still ""fit"" for each other.  IF you do great you stay together and if you don't then you break up and each go their separate way.  What is not useful though is thinking your partner is not being faithful to you and just complain to your friends.  That doesn't accomplish anything.

If they are failing in your eyes (right or wrong) you should leave your position and move on to a new ""relationship"".",10xwannabe,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/n2km1z/cydy_failure_thesis_its_management_the_drug_or/gwl1zf9/,0.111,0.811,0.078,-0.6154
