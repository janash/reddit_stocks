22,DD," The market has been pretty hostile to small caps lately. They did make a recent comeback but many got slapped halfway back down again. The small cap correction has all but killed most short term speculative opportunity with most of them. Even trying to ride them up and down on swings is a much riskier prospect now. 

A lot of that buzz earlier in the year came from how explosive everything was from the bull run and GME hype explosion. You saw DD after DD for what folks were would be the next easy pop to see big gains on. But the Feb/Mar corrections popped that bubble brutally and many are still reeling from losses. 

Now in this current kangaroo market the wider market it is, bearish sentiment tends to dominate for most pennies cause many are too unpredictable right now to try and quick flip. Your best bet is find something dormant and hoping a catalyst rockets it up. Naturally many donâ€™t got the patience and have drifted to more bustling opportunities. 

Put all this together and you have the current state of the sub.",OKJMaster44,9,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/n6lglb/daily_discussion_thread/gx9f5gc/,0.1,0.76,0.14,0.8365

27,DD," Call me pessimistic, but I'm beginning to think it might not get back to +$10 until they release US audited earnings reports for 2021 with the mining results included.

The undercurrent of extreme caution and skepticism towards Chinese stocks is too strong, especially with the short reports in February. I swear, even if they open up mining in the US at those three power plants, people still won't buy it. I mean, they just released their 2020 US audited earnings report, announced their renewable energy crypto mine is fully operating, and that they received their new order of 575 ETH miners, all while ETH is near its all-time high and BTC is still closer to $60k than $50k. All that in the last three days and what does it have to show for it? A share price *drop* of 14 cents.

I might get burned, but I'm starting to think about selling my shares and just buying 2023 calls to collect the gains the stock deserves, but use the freed up capital on something else that's less depressing to look at every day.

Edit: Case in point, a lot of the comments on the /r/pennystocks post about this catalyst are blindly accusing SOS of being a fraud. Most of them haven't done any DD beyond seeing the country of origin.",badger0511,3,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/n6lglb/daily_discussion_thread/gx9tplz/,0.066,0.852,0.082,0.6798
