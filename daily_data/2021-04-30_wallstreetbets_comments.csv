In DarkPool you negociate the price for the total of stocks exchanged and you don't move the price of the stock. We see since month many little amount of GME stocks bought  in dark pool because brokers use the dark pool to buy stocks asked by retailers but when retailer want to sell, they use the normal market. For this reason retailer have no more impact to move up the stock but have a impact to move it down. It's the reason why you must choose a good broker (Fidelity for example).

89,MSM," I always welcome counterpoints and I greatly appreciate your work to show that on balance good results can be had. 

As I was reading your work, my critical mind thought about a basic truth:

- MSM exist to sell stories AND influence viewers.

To make money and stay in business, MSM and Financial media have to provide something of value - for MF this value is by generally giving market beating tips.

However if I was a billionaire like 90% of MSM owners are (and possibly I even also own a HF like Motley, if those claims are true? I haven't fact checked) then I believe there exists a 'tipping point' if you will. Where perhaps for a specific stock I stand to gain much more than I lose overall by spreading a false narrative.

Perhaps in specific circumstances where I get paid significantly to push a particular narrative.

Perhaps I know my audience are majority boomers so I'll just say what they want to hear and GameStop is attention grabbing and they already made their mind up on it.

281,SPWR," It could but I really don't think so. The fundamentals seem really good for SPWR. 

SPWR has a P/E of ~8, 120% profit margin last quarter, beat earnings estimates for the last 6 quarters, hired a promising new CEO, and recent news of early loan repayment. 

Also several insiders increased their holdings this week, most likely in anticipation of a good earnings report to be released on the 5th of May. 

I really think its one of the few if not the only solar stock that isnt overvalued atm.

I work in AI and want to tell you yards something loud and clear, ANY company selling AI in a box is selling you crap.

Building useful ‚ÄúAI‚Äù is 9 times out of 10 not the code or algorithm you plan on using, most of which are open source and published in academic journals by the way, but in working with stakeholders to properly define the problem, then build data sets, clean and manipulate messy data, then run the modeling, and finally turning predictions and correlations into a product or action by engineering reports, automated actions, an app or what have you.

The entire process takes a lot of human involvement from business stakeholders to data scientists to product managers and software engineers.

No company has sold a successful AI toolkit to a business that they just plug in and it can tackle all kinds of problems. There are companies that sell AI toolkits like Data Robot, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Alteryx, etc that preload models and functions for producing data science tools faster.

There are companies that sell products that use AI, such as using machine vision to create medical protesthetics based on a scan of your bones. 

Each application is carefully curated and the model only works within the system it‚Äôs isolated in.

Palantir has a nice UI, secretive business, prestige, and a general tool that lays out data points, files, etc in a graph and then allows you to search for connections.

They can‚Äôt sell Wendy‚Äôs corporate a tool that will predict which stores you poors are going to be giving hand jobs in the back of. 

I don‚Äôt think we will see AGI in our lifetimes. 

Any AI play should have a specific problem they are trying to solve and a road to solving it, but never just a hope of creating ‚Äútrue‚Äù AI.

If the company is selling a software toolkit for scaling vms or visualization, then sure invest.

They will no longer have the monopoly they had in e-commerce with TaoBao. They can no longer get major brands to only sell on their platform, so Tao Bao sales will be adversely affected.

Their mobile payment domination in china with ÊîØ‰ªòÂÆù/Alipay is about to take a hit with the launch of the Chinese government digital currency which uses its own app.

They are now more limited in their ability to collect and sell personal data because of new government regulations. 

BABA will forever be Jack Ma‚Äôs company, even if he isn‚Äôt directly in charge. He made a huge mistake criticizing the government, so he and his company will forever pay the price. Politically China has a couple sides vying for power behind the scenes. Jack Ma is aligned with the players who aren‚Äôt in power, so that will also negatively affect him and BABA.

520,USA," "" Expected 47% YOY growth, ...""

Shares are always a good idea but they may only go up 10%-20% as compared to 30-100% 

It depends on your risk/reward level calls are definetly riskier but offer more reward I think ITM strikes or just at breakeven is a good call for this week or 2 weeks- 1 month out

Also the IV making the calls cheap also makes it a bad share play because you can‚Äôt sell calls or theta gang your way out of red but I know not everyone gets that advanced and most just hold till green

Here‚Äôs one scenario NOK hits $5

10 NOK calls (10 calls is equivalent to 1000shares) at $4.5 for .20 costs $200 but would be worth $500 if it hits $5 so 150%

Our sales volume has been insane. Like, everyone has been working overtime for months insane. We can't keep up. I think a lot of people incorrectly assume the home buying trend is going down, but it's the opposite. Same with auto and personal loans.

I think Rocket Companies is going to produce another stellar earnings, because they are #1 mortgage lender in North America, so if we are beating our earnings goals by a mile, they must be doing amazing. Not to mention they do so much more than just home loans.

That said, I think another solid earnings is all we need to prove to the market that this is not a meme stock. This is a dead serious company with a growing monopoly on the North American loan market. People are skeptical because it was erroneously lumped in with GME, AMC, etc.

I am expecting the price to shoot above $30 at a minimum, and I truly believe it will stay there. Period. I'm not gonna sit here and say it's gonna moon and we're all going to get rich. But I think everyone who holds RKT will be pleasantly surprised and happy with earnings.

996,MVIS," This is not true at all. IV makes the extrinsic value of option higher. It has no bearing on the intrinsic value. 

Second, the IV of a stock INCREASES if a stock moves either site in big number. IV decreases when underlying trades side ways. 

With earnings, the IV crush happens when the difference in the same strikes put and call (straddle) of 1DTE after earning is MORE than the difference in the change in the securities movement. While IV Crush can happen all the time, it‚Äôs called ‚Äúcrush‚Äù in earnings because that‚Äôs when people expect the price to move in definite terms. So if the price movement is less than the excepted, IV goes down (this is just market correcting itself), but if price movement is MORE than the expected, IV goes up (again correcting the other way). 

TLDR: you‚Äôre wrong on IV crush, MVIS going -20% is gonna increase the IV, not ‚Äúcrush it‚Äù. The premium would be bigger, not smaller.",JoeWelburg,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n1gfnq/i_wonder_what_these_puppies_will_be_worth_tomorrow/gwdm5kc/,0.079,0.859,0.062,-0.4617

1067,USA," 1) I see your point, but you have to also think about cost vs benefit.

There‚Äôs a reason why Moderna and Pfizer are only in the vaccine game with mRNA variants. That‚Äôs what their focus is. To do a complete 180 and switch to a traditional vaccine would cost them and the government far more than buying vaccines from an already proven company.

1332,MVIS, I passed an opportunity for 200% gains and I'm still holding because the end goal is the buyout not a WSB hype surge. I started investing in MVIS about 5 months ago and am still up 70% overall so I don't feel too bad about it.

1333,MVIS, Well to be fair HoloLens still is in the early phases of adoption and so is LIDAR tech. Even if a buyout doesn't happen at the very least HoloLens is going to take off in the next few years which will net some nice royalties for MVIS. I can think of tons of potential applications of HoloLens in my workplace alone and I've seen a handful of them being tested. I imagine that lots of employers are currently evaluating it and might start buying in the next few years especially considering the Army is interested and a lot of tech gets adopted by the military first before it goes mainstream.,IKnowGuacIsExtraLady,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n1uiek/mvis_is_bargain_of_the_century_right_now/gwfy1ec/,0.018,0.894,0.088,0.7845

VIAC just launched internationally on March 4th for Latin America, March 25th Scandinavia and their still waiting on Australia... so maybe they just need a lil time.  
Haven't looked into how much money their other segments are doing this quarter.  
\-----------  
I like HBO/AT&T but they got tons of debt, but a they could see a big overall margin increase in my mind. Lots of other parts of their business to consider.  


Another point for movies this year is online rentals for Godzilla vs Kong might have been close to box office revenues due to covid-19.   


Only U.S. gets it free on HBO and worldwide ticket sales are roughly $70 million U.S.  and $500 Million International.  


I.e. Kong made $500 million in ticket sales and another $500 million renting online (that's only 25 million people).  
 (Only U.S. gets HBO Max + Free movies, so everyone else is choking up $25.00 to rent)  


Godzilla movies generally net like $500 million in ticket sales in Japan alone and the movies is being released late there on May 14th.   


1-2 billion dollars of profit from one movie is nothing to sneeze at for a single quarter.

1363,PLBY," I was wondering betting on PHub and porn industry in general even after a year of potential auditory being locked at homes. Unfortunately PHub is private and the owner has links to corns, shady marketplace and scandals. Also PHub made a PR disaster by removing big part of their content in order to fight claims about child abuse and shit. If it would be public, I would bet it tanked at that moment quite hard and would be perfect opportunity to load (no pun intended).  Anyway, as I've tried to dig tendies related to the the PHub - someone has mentioned there's also a mother-shell company, which supposedly grips the tendies from underlying company. Checked their reports - hasn't found any proof.   
There's always PLBY, but I don't trust them, since they always tried to be Forbes/WSJ with a twist. My best bet would be the one company I think I\`m not allowed to mention because of cap and price, also I think it got delisted from NYSE.
