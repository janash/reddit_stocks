3,SPE," I think the 3.4 billion is a combination of prospective resources (except Umiat, discussed below) from all their leases. The 1.6 billion is from Project Peregrine alone. However, they have not updated that since the Merlin well which found different zones than they were expecting so not sure if that number goes up or down.

Doubtless they will tell us soon. As for Umiat, they are saying the have 2P and 3P reserves but this is not a correct reflection of the SPE PRMS they claim to have applied. They have already said that Umiat is not commercially viable unless other finds at Peregrine are a success to it should be Contingent Resources but then Dave Wall was never one to let definitions get in the way.

7,DD," Peak oil is widely expected to be hit by 2030

https://www.worldoil.com/news/2019/11/13/iea-predicts-global-oil-demand-will-level-off-around-2030

There are more optimistic studies but those have been funded by big oil companies.

If you think about it, the whole carbon free topic is pushed by USA and Europe and its not that much of a topic in emerging countries.

USA and Europe only represent about 1/8 of the world population. Even though the oil consumption is enormously higher then in the rest of the world its still less then half of the oil demand.

Many studies expect a fast increasing demand for oil in emerging countries as these countries grow their economy. I think thats plausible.

So in my mind oil is still around until 2050 at least, even if the media claims otherwise.

Btw anyone can download the presentation from the company website and use it for their DD posts.

49,TWO," Be careful with the information you take from strangers on the internet. ""Gurl"" below just commented multiple times on what you should do as if she knows what she's talking about enough to give advice but if you look further down you'll see she just posted a comment stating she just made her ""first big purchase"" of $90....I have over $50K invested.

In my OPINION, you should always diversify in almost any type of investing you do. I personally have 17 different OTC stocks at the moment. MOST OTC stocks will end up at $0.00 in the long term (and by most I mean 19/20) so unless you are extremely well versed in financial sheet analysis (I already know you aren't just by the question you asked) trying to pick out the perfect ones isn't doable for most people.

12 of the 17 stocks I own are more than 25% losses at the moment. 3 are profitable in the 10-20%ish return on investment range, and TWO I have made well over 1000% on each.

In the land of penny stocks it's about picking a couple that will have massive returns and knowing that most will leave you with a hole in your pocket if you hold them for too long.
