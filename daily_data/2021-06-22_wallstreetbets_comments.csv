And just shorting GME was not the problem.  In normal markers it was probably smart.  The issue were the big players doing fraudulent naked shorts and using insider info to manipulate the price.  Two very different animals.

I'm glad GME is reforming and I've been invested since January and believe they will turn around.  But let's not forget that GameStop, for the last 20+ years, was a terrible business both in execution and in presence.  It was the last place any real gamer wanted to ever go to and when they did it was always an annoying and obnoxious experience. 

Now that they were targeted by short sellers and people have essentially accidentally made millions, collective amnesia is occuring and people act like GME was some gamers mecca when it couldn't have been more the opposite for it's entire existence up until this year.",digitalhandyman,34,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o5f72j/hedge_fund_that_bet_against_gamestop_is_closing/h2n2q3y/,0.09,0.829,0.08,-0.7131

88,GME," There is some reason to be skeptical that they can ever reach their current valuation though. Gaming industry will be all about market share. GME has a ton of opportunity and is in a great position to acquire a large part of future market share but nothing is guaranteed. Microsoft is making it increasingly difficult to need any middle man in its products for instance. Games are downloaded straight to Xbox, same with Playstation and Steam on PC. Microsoft and Netflix are also entering the cloud gaming space. Facebook, Microsoft, Sony, and others are all chasing VR.

So there are some legitimate concerns. A lot GME could do, especially in emerging tech spaces like VR/AR/E-Sports. I love the idea of them acquiring Corsair somehow. Elgato and SCUF are fantastic brands. They'll have to do a lot more than that to maintain a $21B market cap though.

On 6/9/2021 1.5mil shares were traded at $80.07 in one transaction.  This could be buying, or selling.  unknown.  But, since we're above that $80 level, it could be buying.  

on 6/7/2021 1 mil shares were traded @ $81.41. We're above those levels, so, could be buying.

on 6/2/2021 1mil @ $81.71.  We're above those levels, so, could be buying.  

on 5/21/2021 1.07mil shares were traded $77.20. Again, we're above so, could be buying. 

Now, you can trace 1mil shares traded in a single shot all the way back to 3/9/2021 ranging from $73.96 all the way up to the most recent large trade @ $81.71 that happened on 6/7/2021. 

You have to go all the way back to 2/18/2021 to find a 1mil trade that was done at a higher price than where we're at now.  So, Wall Street may have been accumulating 25+ mil shares of this stock. Since we haven't really seen any new large trades in a few weeks, they may have fully entered their position and, like you said, are waiting for the catalyst to move it up.

I would suggest reading about Amazon Graviton, if you don‚Äôt think the big guys are gunning to replace the intel/AMD.

-Tesla premium models are exceptionally low volumes. Even Tesla as a whole doesn‚Äôt build enough cars to justify building their own general purpose compute and graphics chips yet- as you said, it‚Äôs very expensive. Tesla already did build their own silicon for autopilot inference- I don‚Äôt believe full self driving will ever work with their current sensor suite, but that‚Äôs a totally separate problem.

-I agree, it‚Äôs not a certainty and there is risk of other architectures replacing ARM in the industry, but I‚Äôm not super optimistic that will happen for a long time. I would still argue it‚Äôs definitely a bearish concern for AMD.",ElectricalGene6146,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o5bfvw/amd_merger_incoming_breakout_catalyst_34_weeks/h2n8py7/,0.108,0.782,0.11,0.066

808,CCS," /u/pennyether

I'm glad more people are coming to realize the unreal potential for homebuilding stocks, as I've been screaming about it for a bit now. 

I actually wrote about the Lennar/CCS play here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nwtg7n/ccslennar\_like\_good\_god\_ccs\_is\_making\_me\_hot\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nwtg7n/ccslennar_like_good_god_ccs_is_making_me_hot_and/) 

Although, I ultimately sold my Lennar calls the day before earnings for a small profit as I had to exercise SOME risk management. I was on almost 27K margin across various plays (Commons and options across a few stocks), and had to deleverage for my own peace of mind (plus i was looking at Lennar to give me guidance on CCS/Homebuilders, even though I already knew it was going to be a great earnings beat). 

After the Lennar Earnings, and the economic data I wrote this piece here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o3y8tf/ccs\_the\_company\_making\_a\_shit\_ton\_of\_cash/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o3y8tf/ccs_the_company_making_a_shit_ton_of_cash/) 

I ultimately prefer CCS because it's undervalued in terms of trailing p/e and forward p/e and is simultaneously projecting higher revenue growth compared to Lennar and pretty much any other name (with the exception of one or two stocks), with a dividend yield that's comparable. I also am pretty sure it's going to beat it's EPS estimate like it has the other 5 quarters. It also dropped much harder than other home builder stocks. 

With that said, I think the sector as a whole is poised for a strong golden age in the next 5 years (at absolute minimum) and you could pick any homebuilder and make a ton of money.",Hani95,4,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o5tbpf/kbh_theres_no_place_like_homo/h2or737/,0.02,0.827,0.154,0.9839

1451,CLF," 5 years is nothing. Steel is cyclical, look way back.

  US Steel ($X) is trading at $28 but has traded at $44 in 2018, $40 in 2014, $60 in 2011 and 2010, and a whopping $200 in 2008. 

  $CLF traded at $26 in 2013, $100 in 2011 and $120 in 2008. And that company was just the old CLF that mined iron ore and produced iron pellets. New CLF has acquired AK Steel and ArcelorMittalUS, making it the biggest integrated steel producer in the US.

  AK Steel traded at $2.5 before being acquired (late 2019). But had highs such as $11 in 2016 and 2014, $23 in 2010 and 2009, and $72 in 2008.

CLF just last week gave updated guidance of $5 billion EBITDA for FY 2021, the stock's mkt cap is $10 billion.

Ask yourself: would you spend $1,000 to buy a business that profits $500 per year? 

That's what you're doing with CLF. With TSLA, for example you're spending $1,000 to buy a business that profits $1.63 per year. 

Obviously, the reason TSLA carries that sort of valuation is because the 10 year exponential growth track is baked in to the current price. CLF? They just finished completing their vertical integration re-structure, and precisely no exponential growth is baked in to the price, in fact its the opposite.

QNX auto has mouse nuts worth of revenue, especially on a per-vehicle basis. Modern vehicles have lots of computers and if any of them use QNX, then $BB counts it as a design win. It could be a simple body controller or the main infotainment computer.

Growth at 9% of a small number is a small number.  Furthermore, auto makers are realizing they have to get better at software and are taking more of that in house. At best, QNX wins a very small revenue slice as a base OS.. which is also easily replaced by Linux.

7.3B is cutoff for R2000. UWM had a total market cap of 11.13B (1.6B x $6.96 SP at close 5/7/21) on rank day.

If you look back, almost every one of their earnings calls or reports has not been profitable save a few times. At the current price, would I buy? Sure but only if I was sitting on a lot of cash. I would more likely buy a biggee load of we get back to $10-11 range. $12 is not bad, but again not where I personally feel the company is valued at yet right now in present day.

1688,RKT," I commented on this last week. It had a pretty good looking options chain, in terms of gamma ramp and vanna.

Here is today's ramp. Not as juicy, but $20.00/$21.00 looks easy, and vanna is high... so if there's real volatility more shares might be purchased to deltahedge against it.

I'm not a fan of this options chain because it mostly hinges on whales going in, or actual volatility that will make the MMs want to hedge more aggressively. Other than that, it's near the peak and can slide either way just as easily.

Honestly, I think simple answer is that the UWMC charts just don‚Äôt looking that great right now (pretty bearish tbh). The price had a big run up over the course of a month and so a lot of people probably took profits. The good news is that the price has found some pretty solid support around $9 so it‚Äôs not like everyone is running for the exits. However, unless a big player comes in with huge buy/sell orders or some big news drops, you probably won‚Äôt see much price action over the next few days. 

Fundamentals certainly drive the price over the long term but they don‚Äôt really drive it over the short term. On that note, a possible rate increase is a bigger issue for most potential investors than many on WSB seem to think. An increase may improve margins but it will also decrease volume. How will that impact the bottom line?

1. Public stock is relative new
2. HF believe the IPO was overvalued and the shorted it a lot
3. A lot of open interest from retail investor and not enough volume in shares

1758,UWMC," No problem. So with an MSR business, they essentially have the ""right"" to collect fees since they ""service"" mortgages. That means they'll collect payments, potentially put them through the foreclosure process and cover the costs (potentially make a profit), etc. So they would earn some sort of basis point on the outstanding of the principal of the mortgage.

So the rights end when a mortgage is refinanced (which is what we witnessed in the falling interest rate environment). In essence, the income stream are actually less when rates are low, and longer when rates are rising. If you look back during the housing bubble, in 2007, MSRs could've been valued at as much as 6X annual fees. However, when the bubble burst, they were about 2X as much.

It's very perplexing how this isn't getting priced in. The company even mentioned they're forecasting growth / stability in the coming quarters.

1836,LMAO," You can call me or yourself whatever the fvck you want I really don't care at this point. But I do know for a fact your order was sold. I know this because someone bought 25 contracts of the 25c 7/16 for $2.19 eight seconds before your order began to execute at $2.33. It wasn't just ""by chance"" they bought 25 because it was way higher volume than the typical volume of trades on that contract today and eight seconds is just too close (maybe they sold your quote request instead of the execution idk but someone knew you were placing that order before it happened). Whoever they sold that data too probably filled part of your order at $2.33 for a profit of $350 LMAO. Hate me all you want but this is the truth in the execution real which I again linked. Maybe you need to go talk to your broker about that.

Why did I call you out? If you were using a good broker then it would have been closer together.  I assumed the 25 was part of your order and could not sum a combined order that equaled exactly 500. Did I jump to a conclusion? yes. Do people post fake positions that do not coincide with real orders. yes as well. My issue was that you were ether lying (congratulations you're not) or hold a majority of all open interest on that contract which is normally a sign of a P&D.

NSCC-801 was passed some time ago without objection. In order for this rule to go into effect, it must piggyback with NSCC-002, it will go into effect tomorrow, 6/23/2021. Let me remind you how powerful 801 really is.... Once 801 enters effect, all hedgefunds holding short positions will be monitored Every. Single. Minute. They will have to report EVERY SINGLE MINUTE their value in short positions versus their actual money on hand. If they fail to report or their short position value crosses the threshold where it is higher than their money on hand, it is an immediate warning to deposit the funds needed to cover within ONE HOUR. Failure to do so leads to the NSCC immediately overriding operations and liquidating the hedge funds entirely

What I like about Fisker over RIDE is Henrik is at least smart enough (after learning from his prior company going bankrupt after going to production of the Karma) to realize that producing vehicles is really hard, so he just instead sticks to coming out with new drawings of proposed EV's every now and then. RIDE is way too deep in the rabbit-hole now and they are likely trying to figure out how to generate enough interest to raise additional funds before they announce a delay till end of 2022.

1992,RIDE," I don't care how many MPG you get. If you are going to try to sell an off-road vehicle that in civilian dress gets only 40 miles of range at 20 miles per hour, when they can buy gas vehicles that can go 60 mph+ and for further distances, I think it is pretty clear which vehicle the military will not be buying.

As to manufacturer of brakes requiring slower speeds... Where does this BS even come from? This company is supposed to start production in 3 months and this is the nonsense you excuse them with.

Basically, there is no other side than trust a company that has lied and was led by a guy who has never been able to produce anything, which is putting out a vehicle with an unproven technology for it (and in-fact in their response to the short-report they said they had to do extra work tuning the suspension, making the vehicle stronger, AND ADDING WEIGHT, for the in-wheel motors to work. How the heck does this make sense for an EV and sure does not sound like it makes them easier to build). Their new top person, Angela Strand, has a resume that lists companies that have failed in the time she was there (not saying she was responsible, but obviously she has never saved a company in a tough situation... why anyone thinks she will do well with RIDE is beyond me).",aka0007,0,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o5pdge/ride_added_to_the_russell_2000_significant_upside/h2oiw19/,0.063,0.863,0.074,0.186

his in game name was Kulthar.

We used to chat on skype at the time, this was before discord even existed.

One day he was coughing alot, told us he may not be around much longer, he was sick.

He never logged on to [battle.net](https://battle.net) for 9 years and counting after that day.

**RIP Kulthar. You were a king.  I don't even know your real name.**

We never know how long our lives will last;

This is why we must YOLO.
