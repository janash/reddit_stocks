46,ATOS, I'm bullish on ATOS. It has an investor vote coming up with a crap ton of free capital and no debt. They also have three great drugs in the pipe line. One of which is a breast cancer drug that was so effective it blew threw phase one trials in about a month. Shortly after they had a direct offering at $2.88 and that's when the shorts and crashes started. A huge institution bought in at 2.88 and you're telling me that it's worth 1.70? With such an effect test result? With patience that are already on the medication? With evidence of an upcoming merger/acquisition? Nah my guy. This has looked like hot garbage for a solid month now but so has everything else and I don't believe it should be this low of a price. Once news on phase two hits and with luck phase 3...
