0,GS," The risk which the Fed is addressing is not flight from banking, but flight to strength. 

BoA, JP, GS etc. have stronger balance sheets. When you move 50% of your corporate funds out of a regional bank, you would want to go to a larger, and therefore safer, institution. If people started doubting the Fed's support to smaller institutions, it could lead to systemic movement of deposits up the ladder, leading to cascading failures at smaller institutions. This would be very disruptive in the short run, and would lead to an even more concentrated oligopolistic market structure in the long run, but the Fed's response to the SVB failure should make this entire scenario less likely.",oldmansalvatore,26,/r/stocks/comments/11ubd2e/the_official_academic_study_saying_186_banks_at/jco0ayb/,0.118,0.74,0.142,0.4956

64,JPM," I very much disagree with how you phrased that question. You ask ""what is the safest bank **Stock** if the situation gets worse?"" If a bank fails, obviously the stock will tank, maybe go to zero, maybe permanently halted. That risk exists for every single small community bank stock. Now some of the larger banks, appear to be under zero risk of failing. They are well capitalized and if anything, their deposits have increased since SIVB. But that does not mean the **stock** is safe. If JPM doesn't fail, will the stock go up? I don't think so. The whole sector is on shaky ground and it needs a catalyst. 

You have to look at risk in this situation. Dodd-Frank crippled the ability of the banks to become highly profitable business. You have to ask yourself what will be the regulatory fall-out of SIVB. If you want to make a bet that the regulatory fall-out will not have an impact of the bank's ability to create yield, then I would say any of the big banks are the ""safest"". Most of the stocks have been slaughtered and seem to be pricing in decreased earnings potential going forward. If things remain the same, that is the catalyst you need.

I think Japan is evidence QE may possibly work at the zero lower bound without really bad inflation as a necessary consequence.  It seems reasonable critics of the Fed do not disagree with that.  

What they object to is why do central banks have massive balance sheets way past the emotional panics that cause credit crunches?  Not only does there seem to be a lack of evidence of benefit for there to be so much extra liquidity, there seems to be a shifting of the demand curve for reserves.  As the banking system has larger reserves, it adapts, regulators adapt, and now we just need more liquidity.  Additionally there doesn't seem to be a good framework of how much reserves we are even supposed to ""optimally"" need.

George Selgin has stated in his working [paper](https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/working-paper-50-updated-3.pdf):

>The Fed’s actual interest on reserves policy resembles this last alternative, the difference being its use of subsidized interest on reserve payments instead of high mandatory reserve requirements to boost banks’ demand for reserves. That difference makes the interest on reserves alternative less financially repressive in so far as, instead of exposing banks to a larger required reserve tax burden, it lowers that burden, allowing banks in turn to raise their deposit rates somewhat, instead of having to reduce them as they must when they’re compelled to hold more non-interest-bearing reserves. Interest on reserves therefore has both “income” and “substitution” effects on financial intermediation, where the first increases its overall extent, while the second directs a larger share away from private borrowers and toward the Fed. An increased interest rate on both required and excess reserves will be financially repressive so long as the income effect is small relative to the substitution effect. Since the increase in banks’ net interest income consists mainly if not solely of income earned on their (relatively modest) required reserve balances, and most studies suggest that the demand for bank deposits is not very interest elastic, that’s almost certainly the case.

>One of the most disconcerting features of the post-crisis recovery has been the “great productivity slowdown” that has accompanied it (Kravis 2017). Since the start of the recession in late 2007, labor productivity has grown at an average annual rate of just 1.1
percent—far below the 2.3 percent average growth rate between 1947 and 200. The growth rate of total factor productivity also fell below its pre-crisis trend, where it has remained ever since...San Francisco Fed economists Michael Redmond and Willem Van Zandweghe (2016, p.41) consider a reduced post-crisis supply of credit the “primary suspect” in the post-crisis decline in U.S. total factor productivity, blaming it for having “prevented [established] firms from investing in innovations” and also for making it harder for new firms to enter the market (ibid, p. 39).

The central bank of Norway recognized this problem and got off the ample reserves framework in 2010, [stating](https://static.norges-bank.no/contentassets/cfc83348f4574a719dd5a4ce70a48840/consultative_document_06102010.pdf?v=03/09/2017123145&ft=.pdf):

>When Norges Bank keeps reserves relatively high for a period, it appears that banks gradually adjust to this level…With ever increasing reserves in the banking system, there is a risk that Norges Bank assumes functions that should be left to the market. It is not Norges Bank’s role to provide funding for banks…If a bank has a deficit of reserves towards the end of the day, banks must be able to deal with this by trading in the interbank market.

The ECB seems to be recognizing the dangers as well:

>In the ongoing review of our operational framework, we are analysing whether in the future we will operate under a floor or a corridor system. We hope to conclude this review by the end of the year.

>One important element in our discussion is the amount of central bank reserves required to effectively steer short-term interest rates in either a floor or a corridor system. This amount informs our decision-making as to when balance sheet normalisation might need to be halted. 

>Our current estimates suggest that the amount of central bank reserves currently held by the banking sector exceeds, by a significant margin, the level necessary to steer short-term market rates close to our key policy rate even under a floor system.

>This implies that the current size of our balance sheet is larger than necessary to effectively implement our monetary policy stance. As such, maintaining a large bond portfolio absorbs valuable policy space that may be needed if policy rates were to become constrained again by the effective lower bound.

>Shrinking the balance sheet, to the extent possible, is therefore both prudent and efficient.

>The second reason for reducing the APP portfolio is related to the side effects of running a large balance sheet.

>It is well documented that bond purchases can cause asset price valuations in financial and real estate markets to diverge from their economic fundamentals, thus raising both financial stability risks and wealth inequality.

>Maintaining too large a balance sheet may also have undesirable side effects.

>One is that it could jeopardise central bank’s credibility by giving rise to accusations of financial and fiscal dominance.

>A second side effect is that maintaining a larger balance sheet than necessary increases the Eurosystem’s exposure to credit and duration risk. The probability and extent of net losses are significantly higher the larger the amount of long-term fixed-rate assets the central bank holds on its balance sheet.

So Japan seems like a reasonable data point for ZIRP, QE and their relationship with inflation.  But it doesn't say much about what we're supposed to do after ZIRP.  Moreover QE itself is still a massive experiment.  It's important to consider additionally that Japan is idiosyncratic with a dangerously low birthrate, ageing population, government price controls, as well as a deeply ingrained culture of resisting inflation.",absoluteunitVolcker,3,/r/stocks/comments/11ujeg1/rstocks_weekend_discussion_saturday_mar_18_2023/jcp1fia/,0.051,0.871,0.079,0.9563

142,AAPL," I have a couple of questions about owning the same stock in a bunch of different accounts, some normal accounts, but others Roth and regular IRA.

1. If I own shares of AAPL in a Roth IRA, regular IRA, and also a normal brokerage account, my question is... does the cost basis for the Roth IRA investment or the regular IRA investment have anything at all to do with the cost basis for the standard account investment? I mean in regards to taxes. For example, let's say my cost basis for AAPL was $170 in my ""standard"" brokerage account. But my cost basis in my Roth is $135, and my cost basis in my regular IRA is $141. The only thing that matters from a tax standpoint is the $170 right?

2. Does the wash sale rule apply to purchases/sales in the Roth and regular IRA accounts? For example, let's say I sell my AAPL in my standard account right now, and it would be a loss. Then, a week later, I make a $7500 contribution to my Roth for 2023 and I buy AAPL for it's current price. Would this cause a problem?


The way I think about Roth and regular IRA transactions, is that they're in their own private ecosphere and they have absolutely nothing to do with anything outside of it. Their own private island. But maybe I'm wrong in assuming this.",IHadTacosYesterday,2,/r/stocks/comments/11ujeg1/rstocks_weekend_discussion_saturday_mar_18_2023/jcpz3qw/,0.051,0.932,0.017,-0.8645

145,COIN," Shower thought, magic beans ""value"" is mostly backed by unstable coins.

The issue is, what's backing those stable coins?  We've already seen a few exchanges blow up because of fraud and poor risk management.

Even if the assets aren't bad, what happens when a 4% corporate bond goes to 11% because of rate hikes and downgrades?

It's going to be like SIVB but far worse as unlike banks, the Fed isn't going to send them a lifeline when it fails.

My thought is fleeing to it for ""safety"" won't last long, especially as money continues to get pulled out of risk assets, so short COIN or maybe one of the ETFs?

So it's both company selection, company specific sentiment as well as finding the oversold point. And a stomach for volatility is necessary.

The world is preparing for WW3 between US and China. I’m kind of dumping money in the naive hope it won’t happen and the knowledge it doesn’t matter where your money is if we decide to go to war. Europe is treating China very differently. But now they have to be friends with Biden because of Russia so they’re following a bit more. But the main difference is that Europe understands you don’t need to be #1 to live a #1 lifestyle. Americans have been on top for so long they fear China to an irrational level. So war is what we’re going to get.
