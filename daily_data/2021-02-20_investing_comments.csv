3,TV," I'm by no means a savvy investor or financial guru.

But what I am completely certain of, is that streamers (gaming, podcasts, youtube etc.) will be the biggest celebrities in the coming years and decades.

Bigger than movie stars.

Bigger than star athletes.

11,SE," A few thoughts (also tagging /u/tommyhur because of his comment).

1) I wouldn’t compare Corsair to the tech sector as a whole since SaaS or software firms will skew the comparables.
2) I wouldn’t say Corsair has no rivals. It has competitors in Logitech and computer parts like Seagate and maybe even Micron. Personally, I think that peripherals are higher margin and would weight Corsair more to Logitech than seagate or western digital. Also, does Corsair do any OEM work? Or do they only sell their products? OEM production is low margin but gives you production volume which helps when chips enter a downcycle.
3) Origin and PC companies I would venture to guess are a very minor portion of the business almost to the point that it’ll be negligible to the bottom line.

I’m cautiously bearish. I think gaming culture will be huge moving forward, but I think Corsair has some work to do considering a HyperX, BenQ, and ASUS are already kind of occupying that “sponsorship” space.

There’s also a chip shortage, how is this going to affect Corsair on a forward looking basis?

Personally, I don’t see the catalyst/argument for growth outside of gaming. My personal hypothesis is that brand loyalty is dead for the most part and Corsair and Logitech are interchangeable. 

Also, while the Elgato purchase makes sense, it’s disconnected from the Corsair brand so how is that going to funnel more revenue to Corsair as a whole?

Streamers are also a niche space and I just don’t see the growth vector there. Not everyone who games is going to want to be a streamer.

13,CRSR," I bought 45 shares of CRSR @ $45 because I see some upside, but I don't know if I'm as bullish about their long term prospects.

As an avid PC gamer, and someone who casually streams using an Elgato product, I honestly had no idea Corsair had acquired them. If the bull case is that Elgato will help kick-start a marketing flywheel for Corsair, they have a ton of work to do before that could even become a reality.

49,AMD," The products that are the cornerstone of the streaming market is CPU's and GPUs. Noone will ever think Corsair is synonymical with streaming. I'd say many would argue Intel/AMD is synonymical with streaming.

Corsair essentially sell the products that you do not care that much about name brand on(PSU and RAM) to the consumer market. Their accessories like mice/keyboards are not respected or used by serious gamers(their keyboards rate highest of the accessories). Corsair can only compete on accesories on price and are selling cheap china products. On PSU/ram components i think their name brand is actually quite respected and that is the strongest part of their business.

If i were to buy a corsair product that's not PSU or RAM the only reasoning i can come up with would be: ""i'll pay a little more for this branded cheap china product because i believe Corsair has better QC than that other one 25% cheaper"". I care about quality so I do not own a single Corsair accessory and do not believe I ever have had one.(Probably 15-20 different gaming mice last 12 years, 7 different keyboards etc etc)

That is my analysis of their retail side. If you want to see where Corsair fits in to competitive gaming which pretty much pushes their preferred products into gaming culture the site Prosettings.net can help you. It shows the gear of current professional players in esports.

Anyone who's relatively exposed to the gaming community knows how big the industry really is. I work in event planning and have gone to certain gaming events, that have attracted crowds probably in the 5-6 figures, just know enough to essentially fill an entire baseball stadium or football field. On the business side, think what makes me particularly bullish on CRSR is the fact compared to most other stocks, it's actually reasonably well priced. Not like any of those Fiverr, Docu, Etsy, Growth Stocks that are incredibly excellent companies, but have already experienced some kind of massive up 10-20 folds rally.

It just seems like there has to be a 10lb hammer somewhere.

I use a ton of the Corsairs RAM and have been long since IPO.  I value it at roughly 204$ which breaks down to roughly 20B market cap.  I use DCF valuation, not comparables.  

I think Wall Street is waiting for lock up expiry to take this higher.  A common tactic of firms is to ignore or short a stock until lockup, making smaller OG equity holders exit profitable positions, and then grab the dip.  Its a game of chicken between management and the market.

59,IMO," Just to add some constructive criticism:

You mention their Price/Earnings ratio, but then instead list their earnings per share.

You also compare their debt levels to the tech sector, which IMO is far too broad a category for such a small company. Tech sector includes multiple industries that are not really comparable to $CRSR’s business model. A better comparison would be with the tech hardware, storage, & peripherals industry. With that comparison their debt/equity actually looks very healthy, coming in at 73% vs 264% industry average, and doing better on this metric then about 2/3rds of the companies in that industry.

63,USB," Like many in this thread I recognized the name and started getting interested in their stock. I've built a few PCs, I used one of their PSUs for 7 years and I use their RAM currently, my impression was that they make pretty quality products.

I think though the bull case requires them to really deliver hard on the high margin peripherals. There's only so much you can grow selling rock solid PSUs and RAM, those products are very hard to differentiate. RGB is one way to differentiate RAM, but speaking as someone who bought Corsair RAM, if there were another stick with the same specs that also had RGB and was $10 cheaper I'd buy it.

So how does Corsair differentiate their peripherals? One thing that many companies in the space are doing is creating sort of integrated PC control software that control mostly RGB, but also things like cooling profiles, or gaming profiles which change the output of keyboards or mice. Razer had Synapse, NZXT has CAM, Corsair has iCue. My experience so far has been that all of these are absolute shit, with maybe the exception of NZXT CAM. Basically there are many competing gaming ecosystems and to me none of them really effectively lock in the consumer, and none of them are really good - multiple people I know built PCs in 2020 and hooking up RGB is a nightmare. Once this starts to change then I think investing in the winner of that space would be a good bet.

So what about Corsair? I think their iCue software is one of the worst out there. I was researching them and found this: https://forum.corsair.com/v3/showthread.php?t=203989 Basically they have a proprietary wireless protocol (risky right off the bat) which pairs a device to a USB dongle. Their marketing makes mention in several places that multiple devices can be connected to one dongle, but as it turns out, that's just a defunct beta of their iCue software and firmware which has been abandoned for 6 months. This is Bad Sign to me. I am a software engineer myself and to me it looks like they are stretched thin without he manpower to even deliver on their marketing let alone build a competitive iCue software. So, it's a pass for me for now, and I may even look for puts I like ""selling the rumor"" of a class action lawsuit.

Oh and you know what's worse about the inability to connect multiple devices to a single dongle? Apparently you get real bad crosstalk between dongles that are too close. So you basically can't use more than one Corsair peripheral in wireless mode unless you have enough USB ports far enough apart.",WasabiofIP,2,/r/investing/comments/lnv4xi/taking_a_look_at_corsair_gaming_crsr_5_min_read/go4ziyf/,0.082,0.831,0.087,-0.4801

Heck, I grew up playing 4 sports year round in high school. Could name the starting QB of most major college teams going back a few years (at one point). Now, I’d say well over half of my “sports” viewing is esports. I think my top streamed twitch channel last year was a CSGO tournament stream. And I watched over 200 hours of esport counter strike.

AppHarvest isn't profitable yet, and is not projecting profitability in 2021. They say they want to build 25 farms, but they only are going to have 2 running by 2022. $4bn market cap seems like a bit much for me, especially with so many others innovating in this space.

Now I know that Elon Musk's brother Kimbal is also pretty balls deep in this indoor farming industry, with his own company, Sqaure Roots, and I'm just curious on how AppHarvest has an edge over both SqaureRoots and other indoor farming ventures, and the likelihood of it maintaining that edge in the future

Additionally, many sources cite companies by investor funding,  APPH is quite new and usually don't show up on those articles.  

APPH was foudned in 2017, and has the benefit of newer tech (not being bogged down by legacy tech or infrastructure).  meanwhile Aerofarms has been around since 2004.  There has been a lot more time to build 'awareness'. Additionaly, APPH is located in Kentucky with access to rain water and cheap land, unlike Plenty, which is located in SF.

97,APPH," Why not?  The only reason why not as an entire industry is if energy costs are prohibitive.  That really is the only why not I can see.  We know indoor farming is successful.

Everything else points to indoor farming as the future.  Less water consumption, more cropoutput per acre, etc...

The why not to invest in a specific company is the risk that they can't be price competitive vs traditional farms and the risk that they can't scale up.

Keep in mind, USA traditional farms are price competitive due to subsidies they get - so they aren't exactly a profitable business either.  And as more indoor farms get built, costs will decrease due to tech improvements.  We have already seen the weed boom help improve in door farming tech.

The only blrub I have about Tomatos is

""The company has a long way to go before it makes a dent in the tomato market. In 2015, for example, the U.S. produced 2.7 billion pounds of fresh tomatoes, mostly in Florida and California. But that production only fed around 40% of demand. The rest was made up by imports from Mexico and Canada, according to a report by the University of Florida. Fresh tomato production in the U.S. has been declining over the last two decades, the report said, partly because of drought.

Webb believes AppHarvest can help reverse that trend and expand it, eventually, to many varieties of fruit and vegetables.

“That’s where agriculture, as a whole, is moving,” he said.""

107,EV," I'm viewing it in the lens of which way is society trending.  I 100% agree that indoor farming is as of now, less practical and is more costly than outdoor farming.

But you can say the same thing for EV vs traditional cars.  Or Wind/Solar energy vs coal and burning fossil fuels.  Look at the valuation of Tesla or Lucid.  Or what happens to a car company stock when they announce a EV program.

Society, and the people in charge are pushing towards a more sustainable future.  It woudln't be hard to imagine Cali giving grants to indoor farms just like they give grants to green companies.  This is a bet on the way society is going, plus it just makes sense that we'd grow in doors in the future, since it's not exposed to climate and has lower water needs, and won't be disrupting the land.

With that said, competition is not the main risk IMO.  Cost of entry for indoor farming is big, due to big costs up front.  Also food is food, it's always gonna be needed

My worries are if APPH can grow properly and continue to lower costs.  It will also need additional funding to build out more indoor farms.  The shares are valued with the expectation of growth.

114,AG," 1) The US population is not projected to increase enough to cause the TAM to grow.
2) The vast majority of the food we eat ultimately comes from row crops (wheat, corn, soybeans, etc). You can't grow row crops indoors.
3) You can't export FRESH produce overseas, where population is expected to grow.

These things mean that the only real utility of indoor farming is in high population areas where outdoor farming can't meet the demand.  New England, Dubai, places like that.

116,APPH," I am not sure.  I think in the long future, itll go down as indoor farming increases.  I'd imagine slowly outdoor farming becomes obsolute when their costs are too high, or outdoor farms start using their land to build indoor farms.  And as that hhappens, subsidies slowly drops.   I think traditional farmers get subsidies to whether hte volatiliy of each season//year due to climate.  At least that's my understanding.

With that said, there may be future support for indoor farming as well.

Similarly, the Agricultural Research Service is working on a project to increase U.S. tomato production and quality in greenhouses and other protected-environments. We look forward to continuing our partnership with our customers, both internal and external.

But keep in mind, companies like Plenty and AeroFresh have been around for a while already, and they are still able to continue to opearate, which suggests to me that assuming they aren't getting subsidies, they have found a way. After all indoor farming can be done year round.  I think the biggest thing holding any company back is money needed to build more indoor farms.

Coal and fossil fuels are cheaper to produce energy than solar and wind.

BUT, money and ivnestments are flowing into EV and renewable energies because its more sustaianble and that's the way society is going.  

That's why indoor farming is the future because, while it may be less practical now, it's more sustainable.  You can make the same argument that outdoor farming has greater cost because of the negative externalities it produces like pesticides, land degredation, and water usage.  I've laid out why outdoor farming is bad.  Pesticide/chemical usage and water usage.  Anyone can look that up.  Not to mention the risks when it comes to climate change and inconsistant crop output.

The rise in asset prices is not inflation, it is a separate phenomenon. Inflation is a measure of the cost of *consumption*. By definition it doesn't include asset prices. 

Central bank buying removes assets from the market, lowering supply which pushes prices higher.

Even when the ust10 yr was yielding 3 or 4 % not too long ago , stock market went up, after the initial sell off. 

Im long in stocks right now, holding a position that i will increase if it happens a 10% decline due this, because i think these scenarios which all are bullish on stocks (considering all the nonsense of valuations, that will keep the same way);

1 - inlfation picks ups, some tapper is announced

If inflation picks up then that sounds like a healthy economy guys. That is the case to be bull in stocks, just as it was a couple of years ago. 
I dont think this is probable , and if it is, would be really cautious, because;

 a) the economy is weak worldwide and a major rise in yields would be bad and start rising complains on corporates
 b) what would happen to the dollar? yes, not good for the trade balance. 

2 - inflation picks up , no tapper announced

As people mentioned before, the FeD is looking the average inflation. So for me this case, could be real, yields will eventually spike a lil bit but no big deal

The impact on valuations anyways, is little when the P/E valuations are skyrocking... after the correction you may think... this was a price to eranings of 50 weeks before ad now is 40... time to buy. Psicological 100% (that is how the markets works nowadays)

147,NBA," >China isn't doing this for the short run.  They're trying to set themselves up to replace the US as the primary global power. 

I agree.  China is also doing this for the long run. I am not sure it will ever be a stand alone power because that presumes the decline of the U.S. and Europe.  I think we will go into a world where there are two or three dominant economic regions.  Today the U.S. is the largest economy, but it is not a monolith and would have serious supply challenges if China's economy collapsed.

&#x200B;

> it would be a disaster for China.  Why would it be a disaster for the West exactly? 

Chinese control a substantial portion of the West's supply chain.  I did not point out that strategically the West is rethinking it's reliance on China, but it will take time to prioritize and rebuild certain supply chains. High priority items will be access to critical natural resources like rare earth minerals, but also strategic areas like pharmaceuticals 

&#x200B;

> Living under an authoritarian government is a much worse outcome for the  West than not being able to sell products to potential consumers in  China, which already isn't allowed for the most part without a number of  unfavorable concessions. 

I agree. It would be bad.  I think many in the West are selling out our collective future for economic gain and influence.  Money and capital want to be deployed for productive means.  The NBA, Disney, and many smaller and lesser known companies have already made this bargain.  I just don't think those who are choosing to do this are thinking long term.

149,IMO," I dont think asset inflation will be able to keep up with monetary inflation for much longer. AKA negative real returns moving forward. I'm not going to try to time it perfectly.

With regards to housing and equity prices, a lot of the price rise is adjusting the premiums an investor could get (raising the prices higher compared to rent received for example)  as bond interest rates went down. How much lower can they really go? A lot of equities are returning under 3% now.

Edit: I think we'll see a wealth transfer to Asia instead of asset holders in the US as the debt is restructured.

The fact they listed with a SPAC doesn't help their cause, because retrospectively it now looks like they did it to skirt around the full disclosure requirement that comes with a traditional listing.

I have a feeling that they just pissed someone off because some of the things that are under question is just weird; such as ""onboarded physician"" stats. If we go after the use of terminology and reported data on each ""success claim"" that tech companies have, probably more than half of them are wrong. 

On the other hand, the big issue here should be use of the personal and medical data. It's where we should have the ethical problem, and I think because it's hard to go after with the current laws and regulations, they're just trying to go after Clover with rest of the stuff (e.g. sentencing mob leader for tax evasion). As it's being their core business, I don't see them being too careless on their legal terms about their data use, especially considering the Silicon Valley big boys supporting them.

Just to add, I have no positions on Clover, didn't now too much about it before your write-up and not planning to having a position without resolving the ethical questions that I have.

181,AMD," Interesting perspective. I think pure value investing ignores value and margin of safety of moats in growth companies. That value is like gold in a mine you own, you just need to extract it, but value investing largely ignores it.

There is a difference between a growth stock that is hoping to capture share in a competitive market and growth stock that has a moat and is scaling into that moat. If you have a demonstrated fundamental technology or network effect moat established, and are just scaling into it, that moat has to be assigned a value. For example AMD back when it was $2. Value investing would have led you to ignore the fact that it had an x86 license duopoly moat and to a lesser extent a graphics technology moat which were worth a lot more than $2B value of the company at the time.",wirerc,3,/r/investing/comments/lnxmex/aswath_damodaran_bradford_cornells_paper_on_the/go3ev94/,0.045,0.706,0.249,0.9807

Starlink is going to be a major problem for TDS in the rurals. I actually live in a city TDS is just now laying fiber lines in (very welcomed as I'm currently a Comcast price taker), but Starlink has also just entered one of the surrounding rural towns that my brother lives in, and he called and told me just how amazing it is yesterday. 150+ mbps when he's used to barely being able to stream with his prior internet provider.",9mac,3,/r/investing/comments/lnxunu/tds_great_value_stock_profitable_excellent_cash/go4rddk/,0.017,0.883,0.099,0.827

186,TDS," Thanks for your comment and I agree revenue growth has been less than impressive.  What makes me not as concerned with that is TDS / US Cellular is losing landline business but is replenishing it with fiber / other business.  

I would expect revenues to drop (which investors are expecting and priced in) but they appear to be replenishing lost landline business with other revenue sources faster than expected.  They have a number of fiber install projects underway now that I am excited about.

188,TDS," I appreciate the comment I think it is a great point.   Starlink will be able to reach these rural areas much quicker than TDS can complete their fiber build outs. 

I am hopeful in a few years once their fiber network is more established they will be able to pick up market share.  This is definitely a few years down the road for TDS to compete in a meaningful way (like you said it’s not in your neighborhood until 2022).  

What I like is TDS is currently incurring upfront costs involved in the fiber installs and is still profitable.  Once these networks are installed they are not expensive to maintain and will further boost their cash flow and profitability.",MarcWau123,3,/r/investing/comments/lnxunu/tds_great_value_stock_profitable_excellent_cash/go4u4x6/,0.0,0.778,0.222,0.9766

196,AAPL," Options expiration week has left the market with bullish hope Friday, but many downtrends still firmly in place. Many momentum stocks from 2020 are in the middle of significant corrections that showed bullish signs Friday, but are likely to be bounces on traders buying the dip on the decline. Stocks like TSLA, PLUG, PTON, WKHS and MSTR need to show strength and break out of their recent down trends.

For the general indices to continue higher, mega-cap tech and semiconductors need to lead and break out higher. Many have corrected for months. Strength in these stocks will lead the next bull-market phase. I'm watching stocks like AMZN, AAPL, MSFT, GOOG and NVDA to lead the breakout of the Nasdaq above 14,000. 

Silver attacked in the pre and post market and continues to be capped during daily action. I expected platinum to lead gold and silver higher, but they haven't followed. If they don't come out of options expiration week strong, they are likely to correct further before their next meaningful move higher. Lots of recent buyers will get frustrates nd give in to the downward pressure in search of gains elsewhere.

""Under the separation plan, DTE Energy shareholders will retain their shares of DTE Energy stock and receive a pro-rata dividend of shares of DT Midstream stock. The separation transaction is expected to be tax-free to DTE Energy and its shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes"".

It’s going around out there that the Float shares/outstanding shown on the website finbox is 99.2%, and using that matrix to say only .08% of shares are able to be bought, which is roughly 3 million.   My question is, is that the correct way to look at that matrix of (float shares/ outstanding) or is that just the total percentage of float on outstandingshares.  Also, if there were only 3 million shares left to be sold, wouldn’t demand be through the roof and skyrocket the price, especially with volume around 40 million yesterday.",rmucken1,1,/r/investing/comments/lo422q/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/go4e3nk/,0.04,0.902,0.058,0.3182

So boomer advice is go all-in on SPY b/c you can't beat the market. And indeed Buffet won that bet that the fund manager couldn't beat the market. (Of course, they were taking 22% off the top...) But the average annual return for SPY is 13.35%.

So I start with $1k. A year later, my SPY position is $1,134.

OR, I make one smart trade a month and exit when I'm at least 1.4% up. After each trade I take out 20% of the profits for short-term cap gains, and reinvest the rest. At the end the year I'd be at $1,143. I just beat the market by almost 1%.

My question is, is it really that hard to find a good entry position in a good stock that goes up 1.4% before a month passes? What am I missing?

I don't think this is substantiated. Brexit being evidence number one that their ""pro business"" attitude might be exagerated.

Bizarrely there are some ""growth"" stocks in FTSE 100 but they are not what you think they would be. Halma industrial and safety equipment conglomerate trades at 46 p/e and is considered growth equity by British investors.

Games Workshop, owners of Warhammer IP, are also trading on FTSE 250 although at ridiculous valuation.

FTSE 100 is filled mostly with old economy low growth names like BP, Shell, Unilever. High dividend so great for dividend growth investor but not something for young investor. Bizarrely there are some ""growth"" stocks in FTSE 100 but they are not what you think they would be. Halma industrial and safety equipment conglomerate trades at 46 p/e and is considered growth equity by British investors. So it Aveva, industrial software company serving gas and oil producers and is trading at 85 p/e. Definitely not your typical growth equities like you see on US markets. Having that said I own Relx, Unilever, Rio Tinto, BHP Group, Intertek Group and Associated British Foods (soon to be sold) from FTSE 100 index.

There is also FTSE 250 which is midcap index. It's a bit meh but there are few interesting equities there. Was lucky enough to load up on National Express during depts of March crash at absolutely ridiculous prices. Avon Rubber is interesting military contractor manufacturing helmets and protective equipment for military and law. Games Workshop, owners of Warhammer IP, are also trading on FTSE 250 although at ridiculous valuation. 

Now AIM index is where the fun is at and I would say look at AIM for some crazy speculative all or nothing venture capital plays. I was lucky enough to acquire ITM Power and Ceres Power before they went to the moon. YouGov, GB Group and Ideagen are some interesting software equities I'm in at the moment. Mirriad Advertising is absolutely crazy company that if it takes off is going to be massive. Sumo Group and Keywords Studios are game developers. Good thing about them is that they don't develop original games but instead help big studios to develop theirs. Great business model and both companies have been doing great. Overall British AIM market is crazy diamonds mine. There's a lot of worthless coal but if you dig around you will find some diamonds.

238,UK," Disclaimer: I’m long-term bearish on the UK 

I’m not really seeing too much of an advantage in FTSE that’s worth the risk or opportunity cost. The lack of tech is a deal breaker, tech has been driving stock market performance in recent years and it’s hard to justify having no exposure to what is and what will continue to be the world’s dominant industry for years to come. If you think tech is overvalued there’s smarter solutions like S&P500 no-tech ETFs. 

As you touched on, a lot of the FTSE is overexposed to financial services, mining and oil. These aren’t companies I look at and think “wow, they have another 50 years of growth in them” the same way I look at a lot of S&P components.

Sure in the short to medium term commodities and oil prices change, banks have record quarters etc but index investing is about long-term buying and holding not swinging on good earnings and market trends. For example biomed is a strong performing sector for obvious reasons will it still be a big deal a decade from now? Two decades? Will current valuations be justified post-covid? 

I don’t think this is something that’s going away. Something I’m surprised you didn’t touch on is so many up-and-coming British companies aren’t IPOing at all as so many of them end up getting acquired by American multinationals or listing on the Nasdaq instead. This is a serious problem for anyone touching British assets and part of the reason for the lack of innovative companies on the FTSE. Today’s startup is tomorrow’s Apple or Tesla and as we’ve said index investing works best long-term this phenomenon could amplify the FTSE’s current problems with overexposure to 20th century industries. 

Sure those companies can aways modernise, as you said Shell is moving out of oil. But as we’ve seen it only takes a handful of startups to sweep the rug from under them. How do you hedge against challenger banks eating into the financial service’s (20% of the FTSE 100) market share. How do you protect your money if energy startups are faster at providing clean infrastructure than BP? As we’ve established it’s unlikely the companies that displace established old players will float in London so you can’t bet on them simply replacing stagnating companies as they grow. 

Next, I really think you’re underplaying Brexit. As of last month the UK had left the fastest growing economic block in the western world and to think that’s not going to seriously stunt its growth potential or damage its ability to keep up with other euro-indexs is a stretch. The “new normal” you talk about might be one of seriously low returns and pessimistic market sentiment. 

The full effects of Brexit are just getting started and so far most of the big economic initiatives and announcements by companies arguably fall under the [broken window fallacy](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/08/broken-window-fallacy.asp), spending money to restore things to the way they were before.

Early Brexit indicators aren’t looking too hot for the UK. [Amsterdam already overtook London](https://www.rte.ie/news/business/2021/0218/1197850-brexit-how-amsterdam-is-stealing-a-march-on-rivals/) as Europe's number one corporate listing venue last year **and** just overtook London as [Europe’s top share trading centre.](https://www.ft.com/content/3dad4ef3-59e8-437e-8f63-f629a5b7d0aa) 

It could well be Britain is in for decades of stagnation, after a decade of lacklustre returns. If you still think the UK will come out on top at the end, is the opportunity cost of keeping your money in FTSE worth that for the potential payoff in the end if you know other index’s will grow at a fairly steady rate with less risk? 

Vaccine progress and covid recovery is all well and good but, once again, index investing is most effective as a long term strategy, at some point covid will be gone and no longer be a factor in economic performance.

The EU is in a lot of financial stress and has lost a substantial amount of money from the UK. The EU has resorted to setting up trade deals with China and shows how desperate they are.

241,PM," I'm not sure pharma is a great investment at the moment.  Vaccine development makes them very little money. They'll only make money again as they develop expensive drugs for things like cancer that will be purchased by rich governments or health organisations.


As far as this Conservative Government goes, yes they will be in power until at least the end of 2024, but they are far from predictable.  They have spent huge sums of money in the last year bailing out companies, paying 80% of huge numbers of people's wages (at one point a quarter of the working population), giving grants and loans out to small companies, increasing welfare etc (it could be argued these are the most socialist policies from a UK Government since the 1940s). Obviously there have been huge mitigating circumstances but they aren't even trying to be fiscally responsible. How they will pay for this over the coming years is anyone's guess but they've already cut services throughout the economy and so taxes somewhere will almost certainly have to rise, and I doubt this can be done entirely on things such as income tax. It seems inconceivable they will find money to cut corporation tax further as it already at a very low level.

I'm also not sure I understand your startup/distributor argument. The FTSE is a large-cap index. It's not where anyone invests if there looking for such things. Like investing in the S&P 500, you're making a bet on big established companies, you're not going to find the ""next Apple"" there either. If you're wanting to expose yourself to disruptive companies, then you'd be looking at entirely different area of the market.

And, on the Brexit point, I suppose I can't say anymore than what I said in my original post: The FTSE 100 is full of international players, not local ones. They are really quite detached from Brexit. The only argument I think is valid is how financial services will function within the EU (that's definitely a risk), but UK financial services are a global phenomenon and always will be.",RonErikson,1,/r/investing/comments/lo36d9/why_i_think_the_ftse_100_is_worth_a_look_amateur/go5mlox/,0.092,0.855,0.053,-0.7193
245,UK," I'm not saying the UK doesn't have long term value, but your arguments are quite bad. 

The UK did handle the vaccine rollout well, but they did not handle their covid response well at all. The UK has the worst death toll from covid in Europe, nearly twice as many as Germany has. My guess is that being a month quicker with the vaccine program isn't going to fix that. It might help to reopen the economy a bit quicker, but the UK economy has also been hit quite a bit harder than most EU nations.

And the red tape argument is quite weak considering Brexit has added mountains of red tape on imports and exports to the EU. Not a problem, if it weren't for the fact that the EU is also the biggest trade partner of the UK.

The EU started negotiations with China about a trade deal back in 2013, before Brexit was even a thing, so how can it be desperation about the UK leaving the EU?
