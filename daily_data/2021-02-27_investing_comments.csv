0,BV," im long BRK, got in at 175 when it was trading below BV, and have been buying ever since (last one being at 228)

my second largest position, first one being SPY

Buffett said he would only buy back the stock when he thought it was undervalued

imo in todays market, BRK is undervalued",uoftsucks1993,67,/r/investing/comments/ltrazp/berkshire_hathaway_beats_q4_eps_consensus_by_423/gp1fx3n/,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
1,IMO," I love Buffet but it’s hard for me to accept the argument that the best use of funds this past year was simply to buy back its own stock. There were many opportunities to buy stock in companies at severely discounted prices due to covid and you didn’t have to go into risky names to do it. 

With the cash pile they were sitting on they could have bought Microsoft when it dipped, or a myriad of other very strong companies. I really like the chevron buy they made but IMO they should have bought a lot more. 

He seems to be at the stage in life that he is ultra risk averse, which makes sense given his age and portfolio size, but to me its an un attractive stock to own simply because I dont see the return matching a lot of other options out there. It’s safe for sure, but there are other safe dividend paying plays that offer better upside to me.",dolphan117,61,/r/investing/comments/ltrazp/berkshire_hathaway_beats_q4_eps_consensus_by_423/gp1lgni/,0.069,0.708,0.223,0.9857
2,AAPL," I have read that Apple makes up over 40% of BRK's equity portfolio.  I feel like I understand the thinking behind this even post stock-split (and definitely in 2016), but it makes me wonder --

1) Does BRK know something about the AAPL silicon line rolling out that isn't public yet (pricing, performance, integration)?

2) Is AAPL looking at acquiring one of the many hyper growth tech companies? (M&As - so hot right now)",going_there,2,/r/investing/comments/ltrazp/berkshire_hathaway_beats_q4_eps_consensus_by_423/gp1nyaz/,0.0,0.901,0.099,0.7476

Yes, it lags behind S&P500 returns, but I am fine with that given it's lower risk. I want more exposure to risk/gains than a savings account/bonds, but want less than pure USA, so I stick it at the total world.

Part of the reason is I don't have any specific concrete reason why I think the USA would under perform the rest of the world, but I do feel that the USA will face a reckoning (multiple self inflicted black swan events) in the coming 25+ years, so I want to hedge my bets via diversification.

16,BP," It lasted a lot longer then a few weeks for a lot of things. Some things went up very quickly but a lot stayed depressed for months. 

I really, really like the chevron buy they made last year, but I would have liked to see him buy more, as well as some other names. In terms of shareholder return when he bought Chevron Exxon was also super low and at that price just the dividend which Exxon has been clear throughout that it wouldn’t cut was something like 8 percent. Just the dividend would have returned more then the 5 percent gain to shareholders that was created via share buyback. And we are talking about a stock that was down over 50 percent from its pre pandemic high. To me there are still amazing deals to be had in the oil space even now. BP has went up a good bit in the last several weeks but I still think it’s one of the easiest buys out there in terms of value.",dolphan117,5,/r/investing/comments/ltrazp/berkshire_hathaway_beats_q4_eps_consensus_by_423/gp1u2v3/,0.048,0.71,0.242,0.9916

1. Huge private debt always precedes big crashes. Look at corporate debt to GDP - it is at a record high and is eerily similar to 1929 (ya know the crash that lead to the great depression).
2. The ""Buffett Indicator"": Total market cap value to GDP - it's at an all time high. In other words, the value of the stocks compared to the value they create is out of . Furthermore, EVERY single time we cross into this bubble level according to this indicator (8 of the last 11 crashes) it leads to a crash. In other words, we have never been this high and kept going.

You can believe history doesn't repeat itself, but one thing is clear: the value of the market is historically high relative to ANY output metric. You can't get something for nothing. Dividends can pay for food, speculation can not. People will dump their stock, because the Bubble always runs out of ""greater fools"".

""Stimulus"" is ""QE"" (which is really bank reserves) and it has had no positive effects on our economy. In fact, unemployment is HIGHER than the Great Financial Crisis of 2009 (it's actually 10% according to Powell/the Fed) and its getting worse, not better. This is another financial crisis (debt) and that started to show in 2019.

In Aug 2007 the banking system failed and it took over a year for the market to feel the effects and ultimately crash. Similarly, today we are having massive constrictions in our financial system. The Fed Wire failed this week (which they dismissed as technical errors, like in 2007), and heck, the CEO of Interactive Brokers said we were dangerously close to the entire financial system failing due to GameStop!

132,IMO," Great stuff!  Some thoughts.

1. Bond yields.  The 10 year yield were tremendous in the late 70's, albeit duration risk was also elevated.  However, it's hard to invest in equities when ya can lock in near double digit yields in bonds.

2. Pressure on returns on capital. When inflation is high and persist the return on capital that a company has to generate to be attractive is much larger.  So yes equities are hurt in a persistent high inflation environment... Bonds and other stores of wealth will look relatively better.

Both these factors are macro concerns in a high persistent inflation environment that will hurt equities.

However I don't see persist inflation in our future.  In the current environment, I have inflation fears.  However, IMO it's unreasonable to think that any spike in inflation will be long lived.  Sure big fiscal, big saving, relaxed shutdowns and broken supply chains will cause a big price pop.  Long term, however, we're in a low inflation world ... World is getting older and tech is lowering costs at exponential rate.

153,TTD," It’s a mix of public and private (soon to be public though). 

Pubmatic was an instant buy for me on IPO, as was Magnite. These smaller adtech companies are going to grow substantially in the next couple years, though they will then fall into the the same bucket I put Criteo in unless they come out of the gate with something unique. 

The number one adtech pick which is slated to go public some time in the next ~12 months is DoubleVerify. They’re an absolute juggernaut on brand safety solutions and currently crushing their competition (IAS, MOAT). They clocked <$100m in revenue 2 years ago and are aiming to blow through >$200m this year, targeting $1b in rev in the next 3 years. They’re attached at the hip to the growth of the entire digital advertising space as a whole, so as it grows they grow alongside it. 

I strongly recommend keeping an eye on them and any press around them because once they go public they’re going to blow up in a major way. 

But other than them the big issue with adtech is that there are too many companies doing the same thing with minor twists. Look for companies that fill a niche and do something unique. It’s what TTD was and is and it has allowed them to grow in ways other companies in the space can only dream of.",FudgieThaWhale,1,/r/investing/comments/ltkij3/criteo_crto_why_one_of_the_biggest_adtech_players/gp1bn2u/,0.011,0.925,0.064,0.8591
154,TTD," Undesirable in terms of what’s on the market today, yes. Their data is nothing special. When it comes to client retention you need to think about who the clients are and why they’re being retained. Retention and growth and two metrics that need to be looked at together as a combined metric. Tons of shitty companies have high retention for their own unique reasons, and that alone is not an indicator of a long term successful company. 

Take TTD for example, they have very high client retention specifically for agencies. This is their bread and butter and it comes from their client service. They noticed that big tech ignored and didn’t prioritize agency relationships so they swooped in and compensated for their lack of proprietary data with insanely good white glove service and it allowed them to keep almost all of their clients and grow them at an insane rate. 

Criteo doesn’t have the same long term prospects as TTD and they don’t fill a niche the way they do. Are they a decent company, sure. Are they something crazy unique and good long term growth? Not in my opinion. They do not stand out among the many many adtech companies that exist and in my experience a ton will be acquired or slip into irrelevance in the next ~5 years.

158,DSP," They do both DSP and SSP, however, their valuation is primarily is where it is because of their display-side platform.

171,GME," Some people have said it’s hedge funds selling holdings to free up funds to cover shorts. I think the negative correlation is almost too good for that. 

I think the increases are immediately causing broad market uncertainty. As GME goes up, the likelihood of an actually squeeze goes up. And if that happens we’re sort of in uncharted territory for the shorting hedge funds. It also shows that a stock can 100% legally be “manipulated” (both down and up) which should give us less confidence in the market.

With that being said, if the short float is really as large as WSB says it is and meme stocks in general (AMC has been mirroring GME on these tears) then I would imagine the hedge funds are considering strategies where they close their positions in other companies to raise capital. I’ve also seen posts showing evidence of popular ETFs that hold major positions in GME, being targeted in some fashion. 

However, tech and growth based stocks in general have been declining in value for the last month or so and that’s that (was) the most thriving sector in the market.

The fed had had reached its inflation target I believe the state was 1 out of 14 attempts....so what makes this time and any further months different?

What are some best practices for buy ETF shares? Is there a certain time of day that is best? I heard its best to avoid market open and market close. I have seen the spread for popular ETFs like VTI be between 1 cent and a few dollars. If I want to buy, do I just watch the spread for a few days to see when the best time to buy is? (For a popular fund like VTI)

Does VTI have never have capital gains distributions? I don't see it when I look at the fund's history.

Is it a bad idea to hold off on investing until covid is over? I feel like the markets may still be more volatile than usual as the impact of covid is not fully realized.

If you need to sell some stocks/ETF once a year or so, is it best time to do this? Is a bear or bull market more ideal to sell?

Does the CRSP stock market index perform better than the SP500 index? Articles like [this](https://www.valuewalk.com/2020/02/sp-500-vs-total-stock-market-index/) say it doesn't. However, when I backtest VTI vs S&P500 funds, VTI has always outperformed them (And every other similar fund)

This is my first market slump I've encountered so I know I am being reactionary, but from what I am reading and gauging etc it's all a bit uncertain at the moment.

Any general comments here would be appreciated. I feel like I've learned a fair bit due to all this (I check Yahoo Finance etc and try to do some homework where I can etc) and will start smaller, slower, and more diverse next time around.

I should add I have two other smaller funds, both tech-related (stupid I know), which I am also selling though they're a third the size of the BG one.",WillDotCom95,1,/r/investing/comments/ltky2b/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/goyy7hp/,0.024,0.888,0.088,0.9099
204,IT," I'm a 23 years old IT student from Germany that currently works at a part time job. 

With financial aid from my parents I have roughly 450€ at the end of each month that I currently just transfer to a savings account. 

I am thinking of putting that money into an ETF (I've been looking at Vanguard's S&P 500 in particular) because even though I want to make my money work for me, the time looking up stocks is better spent studying or working.

Is this an ETF the best option to invest and spent minimal time researching?

Are there reasons for or against Vanguard's S&P 500? And if so which ETF (that are available in Europe) do you recommend instead?",Business_Fly,1,/r/investing/comments/ltky2b/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/goz2p0h/,0.0,0.906,0.094,0.887

207,RH," Posted this in /r/Robinhood but got flaired as a shit post and it was removed I believe...




I understand the general concept of selling puts, but I am confused by RH's collateral system. So i'm looking to sell a put:

>***SELB***

>***Sept 17 expiration***

>***$10 strike price***

>***$6.95 premium collected***


When I go to place the trade it states the collateral as $1000 ofcourse (strike price x 100) but even though I only have ~$350 of cash in my account it lets me place the order. **I own 154 shares of SELB**

Here's my question(s): 

 **1)**Is it using the value of my underlying shares as the extra collateral needed to place the order? I know it does this for covered calls, but I didn't think it did for puts.

 **2)** If the answer is yes, what happens if I want to sell my shares before the expiration date? I expect this stock to clear $20, maybe $30 by the expiration and may want to start scaling out of my position. 

**3)** If the answer to question 1 is no does RH liquidate assets to come up with the required $1k for collateral?",_unfortuN8,1,/r/investing/comments/ltky2b/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gp1e42b/,0.061,0.82,0.118,0.8604

Low-interest rates, meaning the price to borrow money is dirt cheap.  
Inflation by a government stimulus is the third round of cheques.  
Bond yield is going up, usually, bonds go down with inflation.

I manage stocks for my dad who needs to take out an RMD due to his age. We have been fortunate in that his portfolio has almost doubled, but I attribute that to luck as you'll see by how little I understand about stocks...

The cash balance ran out to pay his RMD, so I'm guessing I need to sell some stocks. So my questions are:

* What do I sell? Something that is performing well but that I don't have much faith in? Something that is performing poorly? Different approach entirely? 
* Do I sell enough to cover all the distributions for the entire year, or is it better to do it piecemeal as necessary?
* When do I buy again? Like I said, his portfolio nearly doubled without any action on my part for about a year. How can I determine a balance between letting the stocks just keep doing their thing and reinvesting to keep the growth going?

211,ATH," Relevant info: young, employed with a good salary, want to invest $500K in a long-term portfolio (5+ years). At the start of last year I put a lot of money into stocks, then when things started falling in February I decided to bail out and then I was afraid to get back due to covid. This year I started again, bought a lot at ATH, and ever since the markets are dropping so I lost a lot again but this time I'm not exiting. I learned one lesson: next time DCA, but too late now.

My goal is to have a long-term broad ETF-based portfolio, and my special goal is to not be a lazy investor (like put it all into SPY and check my balance 5 years later) but to learn a whole lot and manage it so that when the market is falling, I want to at least minimize the losses or even make gains. As the most important rule, I never want to get more than 5% below my initial investment (I absolutely want to avoid losses if the next recession arrives and it might take years to just break even).

Some of my thoughts on the possible options:

* Do a stock-bond split like 60-40, invest in gold, and such: that would just set me up for perpetual underperformance, meh.
* Buy put options when markets are doing bad: most corrections are short term, so a put means a fixed amount of loss and the market rebounds before the option expires so I didn't gain anything (with SPY just a few scares would easily wipe out an entire year of gains: a 1 month put 10$ under the current price costs \~2% of the underlying).
* Swing/momentum trading (selling stocks at the same time as buying puts, buying inverse/leveraged ETFs, etc.): this is something I would be interested in but don't know nearly enough to do at a good enough win rate
* Try to predict macro trends, sentiment, etc, and slowly DCA out of stocks into cash when things start to fall, and DCA back into stocks when things start to improve: I guess this would be ideal if I knew where the market is going, but I haven't the faintest

Which direction would you go? I have so much to learn, don't even know where to start.",spiderhater4,1,/r/investing/comments/ltky2b/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gp2m6dt/,0.085,0.795,0.12,0.9285
212,GME," Hello

I'm seeing lots of wild speculation about a GME gamma squeeze, and I'm interested in learning more about what this means. 

My first question is: How often do gamma squeezes actually occur? The only concrete example I know about is the Hunt brothers trying it in 1973, so would I be right in assuming they are rarer than short squeezes?

Secondly: How definitive are publicly available option chain numbers? Much of the wild speculation around GME relies on vague hand waving about 'millions' of ITM options needing to be settled next Monday and Tuesday, but it looks to me as if an exact number could be calculated pretty easily by looking at the open interest numbers. I'm guessing this isn't the case as nobody's waving that number around on the meme stock forums, but I'd be interested to know why not.

Thirdly: The meme boards seem to assume that an open market share transaction *always* takes place when an option ends ITM. Is this true?

My personal position (because I'm aware that's likely strike you as a really odd set of questions): My current level of market knowlege is exceptionally odd. I have never speculated on the stock market before, but one of my first jobs as a graphic designer was spending about a year creating options trading training materials for the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange, so I'm in the possibly unique position of being able to draw 3 different variants of the Black Scholes formula from memory yet having to look up the definition of a Limit Sell on Investopedia. I have recently put a small sum of money that I could afford to lose entirely into GME shares, because there appears a potential for a once in a lifetime short squeeze. My expectation is that this move is similar to (but better odds than) buying a lottery ticket, and if all I get out of it is a feeling of 'I was there' when watching the Hollywood movies about GME, then that's fine... but I am keen to learn more. 

Thanks in advance for any explanations you can give.",Magicarpal,0,/r/investing/comments/ltky2b/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gp02qz1/,0.035,0.835,0.13,0.988

Investopedia in general is great, and they have some getting started guides and a entire education section. Also  https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.investor.gov/&ved=2ahUKEwjP9pq--YrvAhVOXMAKHdk9Cd4QFjAAegQIAxAD&usg=AOvVaw37RClR59F5sHPJon_FA6Ot (investing.gov) has a great getting started guide. I also have some sector/stock recommendations which you may also want to check out. Ok, . So my first sector recommendation would be hospitality and travel. Obviously the sector was effected by the pandemic, but as the end grows closer we could see a after covid economic boom like what was seen at the end of WW2, but some stocks in the sector have reached pre pandemic levels so may be a little risky. Next sector is food and drink, companies like coca cola and pepsi, these stocks were also affected by the pandemic as there income is mostly made from bulk selling to restaurants theaters etc, and on the reliance of an after covid boom could go back up to pre covid levels or higher. The next three are some more unrelated stocks which I chose sort of unrelated to the pandemic, these 3 are proctor and gamble, Sony and tencent. So proctor and gamble is a big company who owns lots of little companies, like head and shoulders, Gillette, oral b and more, they have a good dividend  and is a good stable buy. Next is tencent, a Chinese conglomerate, polymatter did a video on YouTube about the company (not from an investing point of view). They are more of a risky stock as there share price per earnings is high (meaning that investing would be betting on there long term growth). Finally is Sony, a company I actually did a DD on, I'll add it here at the end. For all these stocks, there are some stock analysis on YouTube to check out, as its hard for me to explain it all in one message. Any questions feel free to ask as this is a long but simple explanation. Sony (SNE) DD.  Before I get into the financials, here's an explanation on Sony's different divisions. First, their image and sensing division. Currently, Sony has a staggering 53.5% share of the image sensor market with Samsung being in second with only 18.1%. Why do image sensors matter so much, well, image sensors are key for cameras, medical imaging equipment, security and surveillance, ai and robotics, barcode readers, phones (your phone will have Sony parts unless it's a Samsung) and most lucrative of them all, autonomous vehicles.This currently brings in 26% of Sony's revenue, at a 13.5% margin. Next is Sony music, the biggest music publisher in the world. They have some of the biggest names in the industry, with artists like Ed Sheeran, 21 savage, childish gambino, DJ Khalid and more. And as music streaming grows (with Spotify reporting 29% year over year growth, and tencent music  70%), Sony will be in a great position to dish out music from its signed artists. Music makes up 16% of Sony's revenue at a margin of 20%.( I will talk more about ""other "" at the end of the DD, but just so you know, other is grouped into music). Next is playstation. Sony has managed to do something quite brilliant with playstation, they have managed a transition from physical games to digital games, why does that matter, well, digital games gives sony higher margins. But the most exciting aspect of playstation is ps plus, ps plus has went from only 4m subscribers back 6-7 years ago, to having 48m subscribers, more than HBO max, and actually, ps plus now has a bigger operating profit than Netflix, whilst Netflix had 2x the market cap of the entire Sony business. And that number of ps plus subscribers is only set to grow, with gaming being the fastest growing aspect of entertainment. It is also likely that we will give our children PlayStation's, who will in turn give their kids kids PlayStation, like how whole families come together to watch the Simpsons. You may be thinking of their competitor, Xbox, but Xbox has only really solidified in North America and western Europe, with Sony monopolising the Asian market, due to being founded in Japan. Revenue 26%, operating margin 13%. Next is Sony pictures, a company you may be familiar with, they have made everything from the smurfs, Spiderman and the shark tank. You may know of the ongoing streaming war, and one of my favourite quotes is don't make wars, provide ammo, which is exactly what Sony is doing. You may not know but Netflix don't actually produce their exclusives, they out source it, and one of the studios they outsource it to is Sony, Sony has made quite a hit for Netflix, The crown, with a reported 73 million households watching it. But Sony pictures doesn't just do work for Netflix, they also have done Alex Rider, a prime exclusive and Greyhound, an apple TV exclusive. Sony pictures brought in 8% of revenue at a 9.6% margin. Next is Sony electronics, who make things from headphones, televisions and their world renowned camera's, there are countless videos on YouTube, of people positively speaking of their switch of Nixon to Sony, showing a high brand loyalty in the photography market. 10% of revenue at a 6.6% margin. Next is financial services, I can't comment too much on them, as I didn't research them thoroughly, but I can say that their revenue is  10% at a 10.6% margin. Now I will discuss other. So first up is Sony's quiet move into monopolising anime, the second fastest growing aspect of entertainment, they have acquired crunchy roll, funimaton, aniplex and more. This means that if will be very hard for other streaming services to compete with Sony's anime, like how it was hard to compete with Netflix. A another quote from my business book is be best or be first, and Sony are doing both in the anime market. Next is Sony's car, I feel it's a marketing stunt to show off and advertise their parts to other automakers, but it really shows what Sony is capable of, with Sony audio in the car, sony image sensors, Sony infotainment and more. Lastly is their mobile game, I again can't comment too much on it but it is very popular in Asia and brings in 1 billon in revenue, any questions feel free to ask",notA_cringeyusername,1,/r/investing/comments/ltky2b/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gp31wyh/,0.02,0.863,0.118,0.9988

I would sell when you need the money. Your asset allocation and risk capacity should consider your liquidity needs. Do not try to time the market.

VTI is better than VOO because it covers a larger portion of the market cap. VT is even better because it covers the entire stock market.

DFSVX has outperformed the SP500 since its inception in 1994 by 85 basis points per year even with fees of 51 basis points. AVUV is a fund that has a similar methodology as DFSVX and only has fees of 25 basis points. Note that the reason for that is exposure to the value and size risk factors (and profitability since 2013) and doesn't cover the whole market. The fund should be combined with a total market fund. (I hold a portfolio with AVUS/AVUS/AVDE/AVDV/AVEM)",XorFish,1,/r/investing/comments/ltky2b/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gp19wvm/,0.023,0.825,0.153,0.9909
222,DD," I m a noob as well but I can say that, for my research on seeking alpha, yahoo finance and market watch, we might be be going towards a bearish market, which means a strong correction of the market might happen somewhen around this summer. However you have the already a bigger asset than me and the majority of the people here; time.

Starting to invest now, no matter how wrongly can go, will give you an enormous edge vs people starting to invest in their 30's like me, and 40's like the majority of the investors.

Take your time reading and don't FOMO rocket stocks like the one in WSB, as I did, there is ALWAYS another stock that will rocket, just do your own DD, learn your own risk management and never give up on learning.

Edit: do not listen to nobody on the internet, without fact checking, not even me, nobody knows what will happen tomorrow, but people with knowledge and strong discipline will always prevail, good luck on your journey!",Chosen_Second,4,/r/investing/comments/ltky2b/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gozglvh/,0.034,0.796,0.17,0.9802
223,MSCI," In my opinion, investing in an ETF takes up the least amount of time. It can also be done with low costs (for example using Trade Republic or scalable capital). However, I’d not invest in only a S&P 500 ETF. I would try to build a more diversified portfolio. For example by combining an MSCI World and MSCI Emerging Markets ETF. This way your exposure to the US economy isn’t as big (unless you want that). Before deciding on an ETF to buy, you should think about a strategy (asset classes, regions, etc) and your risk tolerance. Then try to find an ETF/multiple ETFs that are relatively low in costs and fit your strategy.
Vanguard is usually rather inexpensive but there are some other good options from iShares, Lyxor or xTrackers, etc.",raideroffridges,1,/r/investing/comments/ltky2b/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gp0ohgd/,0.035,0.903,0.062,0.5719

225,ALL," I've answered these below, but I recommend using investopedia for definition questions - it's a great resource.



> Revenue: total income from all sources, this is easy.
> Operating Income: How is this different than revenue?
> Net Income: Seems to be income after ALL expenses i.e. profit in the common tongue.


Operating income is revenue less operating expenses (ie. wages, supplies, etc.) while net income or net operating income is revenue less all expenses, operating and non-operating (like taxes).


> Gross Profit: No idea


Sales minus the expenses to make and sell the product.


> Operating Cash Flow


how much cash is generated from operations (ie. the company's actual business).


> Free Cash Flow: Is this the ""liquid"" part of profits?


Cash a company generates after accounting for outflows to support operations and assets.


> Then on margins:
> 
> Gross Margin


Sales minus cost of goods sold - similar to gross profit but not entirely.


> Operating Margin


Profit per dollar of sales after operating expenses but before taxes, interest, etc.


> Profit Margin


What percentage of sales is profit.


> Then on Cash:
> 
> Cash: current liquid assets (cash) on hand. How is this different than ""Free Cash Flow""?


Cash is an asset (ie. how much cash do you have on hand). Free cash flow is how much cash a company generates in a given time period.


> Debt: loans?


Loans, bonds, etc.


> Net Cash: Cash - Debt


Cash minus total liabilities, not just debt.",Familiar_Confusion_2,1,/r/investing/comments/ltky2b/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gp18e65/,0.08,0.666,0.254,0.9951

229,CD," You can get a 5 year CD for 1.5%? Doubtful. I just checked the Ally website and the 5 year is less than 1%. National average for 5 year IG bonds is 0.89%.
