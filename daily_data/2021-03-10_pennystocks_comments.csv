Do yourself a favour. Read this.

Good article came out today AH: U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm on Tuesday said the United States needs to boost domestic production of the minerals used to make electric vehicles, so long as it is done sustainably. The United States has been trying to wean its automobile supply chain off of China and other countries for years, with mixed results. President Joe Biden signed an executive order last month requiring greater coordination among federal agencies on supply chain issues, but many environmentalists have vowed to oppose new U.S. mines.

One thing that’s important is to try and know when the pump is almost over and the dump is coming. By the time Reddit is mentioning a stock I tend to see that’s it’s been hyped elsewhere already.

231,DD," One important thing is to remember to look at the profile of the Redditor who is giving you advice, or posted a great-sounding DD (Due Diligence, or post full of research about a company). If they've been on Reddit for a week, have very low karma, and/or all of their posts are about the same stock in every possible stock group, they're probably not someone you should be listening to. Keep in mind that some people have separate accounts to talk about their trading, but you'll notice a difference in the comments, not just pushing one stock.

My profile is a good one to look at, as an example. I'm relatively new to Reddit, with somewhat high karma, but from posts and comments in groups all over Reddit, not just karma-farming groups. My posts are about cats and grocery carts, and my comments are about all kinds of things. You can see that I'm probably a real person. 

Now compare that to some other profiles you'll find in the Daily Plays thread. Some are folks who have been around for years, some are 1 month old accounts with maybe 100 karma, no posts, and dozens of comments about a single stock.

I think they are a strong hold long term play but I also believe without further development you’re buying in at a temporary peak and that price will go right back down to .05 just like after the peak of their contract with Kroger. Could be wrong and this could be their new floor but I just don’t think so. The fact is this has a long ways to go before it’s incorporated into every router/device but will eventually get there nonetheless.

269,DD," Ok, so here is my DD on lithium miners. 

The future of lithium miners are dependent on drilling extraction technology solutions. There are many parts of a successful DE lithium mining operation:

* Mining Resources
* Drilling technologie solutions

The drilling technology is responsible for producing 99.9% pure lithium. This is considered Tier 1. 

So according to this report, Chile has partnered with a drilling solution company to create clean lithium, which is great news for the company as a whole. 

But... there are steps towards making 99.9% lithium industry ready. Testing the end product to make sure battery manufacturers can make industrial sized car batteries etc. 

An example of a lithium company that produced 99.9% lithium that passed the testing phase was Lake Resources/Lilac Solutions and Novonix (battery maker) tested the product for approval.",PM_Me_Accounts_rGay,2,/r/pennystocks/comments/m1xlzx/lithium_chile_and_summit_nanotech_announce/gqg29iz/,0.0,0.781,0.219,0.9808

271,PFS," Same here, I hold LKE so when ASN mentioned NVX in Jan it got me interested and bought a few.  I topped up again yesterday at 7.6 , was going to wait it out to get closer to 7 to buy but FOMO got the better of me yesterday. Can't see them moving upwards before it fills the gap so I'm still fishing for a few more just above the gap because I couldn't be stuffed watching the screen for a few days and likelihood of actually getting even 100k at 6.9 or lower is FA seeing there is someone already waiting there with a 250k order.

277,COO," It should be reported Spruce Point Capital is shorting the stock with a price target of $0.10, they acknowledged this in their interview. That price point is because that is what the CEO was selling shares for in 2020, his own words.
While they outlined some concerns nothing was that damaging in the report. Their most serious allegations was that executive's brother was convicted of SEC fraud and that emphasized that executive also owns a legal brothel in Nevada. In his interview the brothel really bothered him and he believes someone who owns a brothel should not be allowed to be involved in a company traded on a major exchange. He also pointed out the CEO and COO were previously leadership in failed companies that were accused of fraud when they were dissolved but no charges were filed against them. You can confirm this in any ABML quarterly filing because there is a section that specifically asks these questions. They also allege some conflict of interest 

It is a short thesis and should be viewed as that, he comes off as bias and confirms it with the brothel factoid. So moral outrage and blood libel is a major part of the reasoning.",Kierik,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/m21zxe/abml_warning/gqh042j/,0.124,0.836,0.041,-0.9414
