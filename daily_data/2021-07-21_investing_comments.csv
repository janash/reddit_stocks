0,UK," Someone on r/UKInvesting was talking about air conditioning companies yesterday. There's a huge currently untapped market for this in the UK as people have ignored air con up until recent years. It's very rare to find a house with one.

There's a lot of talks about the fact that we will soon be running out of water, particularly in South America where they rely much more on glacial runoff. There's also a number of projects in Africa building dams at the moment, in particular the Ethiopian dam project on the Nile. Not sure what the play for that would be, although increasingly there are talks that there will soon (within a decade or two) be ""water wars"", assuming we don't have cost-effective desalination soon.

Renewables are obviously a good bet generally although as someone else mentioned you might want to look at component parts like batteries etc for this.",_DeanRiding,22,/r/investing/comments/ooottj/all_of_the_recent_climate_events_have_hit_me/h604zs6/,0.028,0.888,0.084,0.7534

7,GNRC," Im with you. The writing is on the wall so to speak but many eco companies are yet to be proven profitable business models.

Examples: 

With increased drought why isnt there a water drilling company absolutely slaying profits?

With a push for alternative energy why isnt lithium through the roof??

Why have solar companies historically been sketchy investments? 

Why havent recycling companies become profitable mega corps?

I think this is where we are heading but I have yet to see many proven companies breakout to the point where they are great investments. I just think its too early and any company you bet on is going to be high risk high reward with potentially long term holding.

9,SC," I'm not sure how exactly you can really take advantage of all of these companies. Sure there's the obvious ones everyone talks about (nuclear, battery tech, electric cars, green energy, defense, etc) but hundreds of billions of dollars from federal/state/local govt's is going to be spent on upgrading storm water management systems, fire protection, shoreline defenses, etc...   


Sure some of that work will go to the big publicly traded firms like leidos or harris or tetra tech, but a lot will go to your typical, relatively small, firms.   


I dont know if there is a way to invest in that in general. I guess you could look into proxies like the equipment manufacturers that supply them, autodesk, etc.   


Think about how many homes and cities there are along the coasts of the world... most of those are going to need new or upgraded infrastructure. We may see a lot more cities with defenses like New Orleans's. The Army Corps recently estimated a wall around Charleston, SC will cost between $1.5 and $2 billion (just for the core city area).

47,YOU," YOU clearly don’t understand. You said 100% margin is the same thing as x2 leverage, which is just a complete misunderstanding. I know the math is hard bud but try to listen. Not talking about expense ratios here. For indexes that outperform consistently, leveraged etfs do work. TQQQ, SOXL, are exceptions to the rule. They are not good examples of a leveraged etf, as they do not adequately demonstrate the risk whatsoever of compounding returns. It resets daily, so it compounds daily. You ever learn about compound interest in math bud? Similar idea.

TQQQ isn’t even a good example. QQQ is up 35.91% in the past year. TQQQ is up 115.46%, nearly 10% more than 3x of 35.91 (which would be what 3x on margin would look like).

NUGT is a good example, a bull 2x leveraged gold miners index. In the past 3 years, GDMNTR (the index it tracks) is up 16.03%. NUGT should be +32% right? That’s what 2x on margin would be.. Nope. -21.60%.

If an index goes up 1% and the leveraged etf goes up 2%, and the next day the index goes down 1%, and the leveraged etf goes down 2%, you are left with less. 1.02 x .98 = .9996, not 1, which is what margin would leave you at. That small decay due to the way leverage works eats away at gains over time significantly as it compounds. 

They only work if it strongly performs - e.g. semiconductors, tech, or the broad market. A market that is even flat to declining will see underperformance in a leveraged etf.

From direxion, a leveraged etf provider: 
“These leveraged ETFs seek a return that is 200% or -200% of the return of their benchmark index for a single day. The funds should not be expected to provide two times or negative two times the return of the benchmark’s cumulative return for periods greater than a day.”

52,ATR," Using ATR Trailing Stop on ETFs

Hi all,

I’m fairly new to all this but have been doing some swing trading as well as day trading and I’m looking to increase my position size on my ETFs, currently SPY, QQQ, and VGT. I am considering more active and perhaps effective approach to managing stop losses on ETFs than just holding or cutting losses at 10%. I’ve seen plenty of info saying to basically just hold forever but have been able to take profits and enter at a lower price on more than one occasion with these ETFs. Even if it wasn’t a perfect re-entry, it beat just holding.

On SPY, I’ve seen that anytime there’s a 1% (mostly) there’s an opportunity to re-enter for less just a few minutes later. Of course there’s the risk of missing out on some huge bounce back after the fact but I’d honestly rather risk missing a big jump than risk being part of a big drop. I’m particularly weary about a gain turning into a loss, especially considering the spread for these ETFs is generally so minimal. 

I’ve considered 1% for SPY and 2% for QQQ/VGT as they’re generally regarded as more volatile but as I look at the price action history, a 1% doesn’t seem horrendously off base.

81,BIG," I have actually run these numbers several different ways going all the way back to early 2000s and I found out a couple things.

1) The idea that you shouldn't hold leveraged ETFs long term is largely a BIG FAT MYTH! It is based on lumping together all leveraged funds together. However, if we can all agree on one fundamental market truth, then we can get pas this myth. That truth is: The stock market will always go up over the long term. 

That in mind, a 2x or 3x inverse fund is guaranteed to lose. Commodity leveraged funds - probably also guaranteed to lose just based on the fact that the funds are using contracts of future contracts and nothing says commodity prices have to always go up over time.

2) The myth is based on the idea that if you only had 10k (or 100k or 1M or 10M) and you took all your money and did one lump sum purchase of a leveraged fund, that fund could presumably go down 60-70-80% immediately and you would almost never recover. This assumes you never put any more money in

3) Base on a pretty comprehensive analysis, if you commit to a dollar cost averaging strategy - you're young and you decide you will put 10k A YEAR into the 3x leveraged fund, you cannot lose. I repeat, you will make a fortune. I ran the numbers alllllll the way back to when these funds first started, and I assumed you put your 10k in at the markets peak each year (ie. absolute worst timing), and holding the leveraged funds long term DOES work.

Some people say ""But... but... they use future contracts and futures contracts have time value erosion so you never get a real 3x"". Ok, boo-fuckin-hoo. Yes I the market average over the last 20 years has been 10% well your 3x leveraged may average 22%. That's just the way the number work out over the long run because of maths or some shit. Doesn't matter its still way better than dollar cost averaging into a regular index fund.

Lastly, the only other thing that you need to consider is you do need to DE-Leverage at some point because you wont live forever. So if you commit to doing this for the next 30 years, well... after 20 years, if the market is hittin new highs, you need to consider going from 3x to 2x or 1x. Otherwise you get to year 30, market drops 30%, you drop 90% and your fucked... although still better off than the 1x index people. 

Don't listen to anyone else. They are full of shit and for some reason still buy into the myth these shouldn't be held long term despite all the evidence, real, historical, and theoretical that says otherwise.",tyetyemn,10,/r/investing/comments/oor59b/eli5_why_shouldnt_you_hold_leveraged_etfs_long/h60hg35/,0.046,0.885,0.069,0.7856
82,IMO," I made a simple spreadsheet to demonstrate the slippage that occurs in leveraged ETFs:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14uKUBHT6RRlF-8EfrhcC_QVihLBAq8oA6LNdEAu-79Q/

In this example the market falls 3% every day for 30 days, then increases 3% each day for 30 days. After 60 days you can see that the leverage ETF is around 14% lower despite the original investment breaking even. This loss is from slippage, but leverage ETFs also have higher fees which you need to account for and you will experience higher volatility which investors would normally expect a premium for.

There are also liquidation risks with leveraged ETFs meaning there is a chance you could be completely wiped out in a worst case scenario.

Basically they're great if markets continue to behave as they have for the last decade, but with leveraged ETFs it only takes one bad year, or a single liquidation level event and it's game over. You could have been holding for 2 years or 40, but the result is the same, you lose everything.

That said, I'm fairly comfortable with young investors holding leveraged ETF for a few years when they're first starting out IF they have the discipline to do so. It's a bit of a risk, but in general you want to take more risk when you're starting out, then as your wealth grows you can rotate into safer investments. Leverage ETFs are a simple way to take more risk while sticking to a passive investment strategy.

86,ETN," >Don't you get auto-liquidated in a crash? 

Not necessarily. It depends on the structure of your leveraged fund.  
Not all leveraged funds are created equally. For example, a leveraged ETN fund is different from a leveraged ETF. It's very rare, but leveraged ETNs *can* make you go negative. I think this was the case with USO in the COVID crash. Oil futures actually gave negative returns!

All that being said, holding a daily ETF will only make you lose everything if it crashes 2x or 3x the amount in a single day, as explained above. For example, for UPRO to go bust, SPY would have to crash 33% in a single day. And since UPRO is based on the S&P, if the S&P crashes over 20% in a single day, a circuit break is triggered.  So, in this case, it would be nearly be impossible. Something like TQQQ is more likely, but the Nasdaq stocks are also a big part of the S&P nowadays.

It depends what you are betting on. I've been reluctant myself to invest much in oil due to concerns that that oil is going to go away much faster than bagholders realize.

I've recently come around to the thesis that oil prices will be able to maintain pricing power for the foreseeable future, because US and other policy makers are going to reject new pipelines, drilling, and fracking...and this will put a lid on supply. This is going to benefit big producers.

92,DARE," Just looking at their chart for the last 6 months, it's pretty rough. Most bios peaked in February and many have been losing steam for the past while, but this one seems down more than many. Do you see upcoming catalysts for significant change?

I'm personally into DARE, which has a number of advanced stage women's health products with upcoming catalysts and recently got a $50m grant from the Gates Foundation. I don't trust analyst price targets for bio companies \[even for ones I'm in\]- they're all very high and usually depend upon the company having significant success in all their current trials (which is nowhere near a sure thing).

Bios are mostly about significant upticks on catalysts, so for good DD I'd want to know more about what you think those are to break out of their current rut.",HonestlyDontKnow24,6,/r/investing/comments/oosf7h/txmd_therapeutics_stock_breaking_out/h60r7s8/,0.05,0.78,0.17,0.9507

94,TXMD," I'm bullish on TXMD in the long run. Got in at 1.47, been holding through this dip. It will be curious to see if they can sustain their recent growth. I wasnt following them in 2o20 when they crashed from like $7 to $1. But they've held the $1 line very well.

98,JPM," I've been using it on my own holdings as well because I'm pretty strong convert to the idea it does have strong indications and it did for JPM actually (my most microscoped stock right now).

But where I first learned about this was specifically against the S&P so I disagree it has no value for SPY.

Better results may be true with equity and not indexes. But I figure keeping an eye on the index helps evaluate sentiment a little more.

I do think the pinning was seen in the Gamma. We will see tomorrow given how gamma has changed. Could have been a fluke. Could be a fluke 10 times. We will see.",DarthTrader357,1,/r/investing/comments/oobpxl/wednesday_spy_430_to_433_probably_leans_431/h5xw8jj/,0.058,0.768,0.174,0.9127
