**This is what the shorts are doing right now.**

**Dont feel like reading a novel? The short and dirty (TLDR AT THE FUCKING BOTTOM):**

 
Short Attack:

1. Sell **fake**, COUNTERFEIT stocks between hedge funds and increasingly lower ask prices to try to scare other investors into selling and/or to trigger limit sell price points. They've been doing this all week. Each major price drop has been because of this tactic.


2. Get the media to spread fear, doubt, and uncertainty. Anyone watching CNBC this week has seen this in action.


3. Spread disinformation through ""analysis"" to get people to sell their stocks because ""the fundamentals aren't there"". Again, this is all over the place right now.


4. Open class action lawsuits against the company/shareholders claiming they're artificially inflating the stock price. Haven't seen it yet, but they've definitely threatened it.


5. Get the government/SEC involved alleging the same as #4. Definitely happening.


6. Pull margin shares and sell them. As seen being done by Robinhood over the last two days.


7. Spread FUD on message boards. Hello 4 million new subs pushing AMC, BB, SLV, etc.

Basically this past week has been 9/10 of the tactics in the short attack playbook to try to either push Gamestop into bankruptcy so they can profit on their short positions or slowly gain them back when people sell their stocks.

* Jim Cramer, in a video-taped interview with The Street.com, best described the media function:

When (shorting) ... The hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful, because the truth is so against your view, (so the hedge funds) create a new 'truth' that is development of the fiction... you hit the brokerage houses with a series of orders (a short down ladder that pushes the price down), then we go to the press. You have a vicious cycle down - it's a pretty good game.*

**Yet more support for the at times illegal and unethical nature of these practices: (THANK YOU, /u/catolicquotes**

**Pulling Margin** from long customers during a short attack serves two purposes. Obviously the flood of shares that are “forced” sales help drive the price down, which aids the short cause in general. More important, for the broker dealers who clear for their retail customers at the same time they short against them, it creates a built-in source of cheap shares from which they can cover their open short positions.

Some of the **broker dealers short against their retail customers** from their proprietary trading desks, or “prop” desks. These are trades owned by the broker dealer, and, while they are not illegal, ethical questions certainly exist. The retail customers, who may be purchasing long investments that are being pushed by the broker dealer's retail network, have no inkling that the broker is taking a large short position contrary to the retail investor's position. With the encouragement of easy margin credit, i.e. 30% equity, the retail customers load up on stock and margin debt.

**The broker dealer, in concert with other shorts, may crash the stock by flooding the board with counterfeit shares, dropping the stock price**. The broker dealers know the amount of margin debt and the price at which their retail customers get into margin trouble. They can accelerate the squeeze on their retail customers by arbitrarily increasing the equity (percentage) requirement as the price is dropping, **frequently citing “volatility”**; which is really the shorts flooding the board with counterfeit shares.

The compounding effect of a dropping price and increasing equity requirement flushes out more shares. The broker dealers sometimes will take over the account during a margin sell-off. By engaging in poor trading practices, such as heavy selling over lunch hour; concentrated “dumps” of shares; hitting the bid with market orders; and conspiring with other trading desks, **they can further plummet the value of the stock and maximize the shares they have stripped from their retail customers**.

Most of the broker dealers who have both retail customers and prop-desk trading appear to engage in these practices. Goldman, Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch have been named in suits alleging these practices. Goldman made billions shorting against the subprime mortgage industry at the same time they were selling subprime investments to their customers.

20,TV," Former journalist here, turned TV writer smooth brain.

Here's how to deal with the tech and biz journalists who don't know how to find Reddit on the internet

Stop calling out outlets. Start calling out the specific journalists by name.

Explain why they are dead wrong, even if just for a sentence fragment. Though ideally more damning information is... More damning

That way when said journalists' names are searched on WSB, the platform on which they supposedly are  a \*sPeCiAL ExprT\*\~, they'll look like the goons they  are.

Journalists protect their reputations over their publications' reputations.

Journalists will not be able to sell their WSB book proposals if they look like dorks all over WSB

And I promise you, there are like 14390129341 book proposals being written by these same people right now. They all want their $100K advance off of your story

The bait and switch with respect to Citadel being long SLV is a false flag. Yes, Citadel is long SLV. This is why we keep saying and have been saying since the start of last year that all you do by buying SLV is put money in bankers' pockets and let them dump more worthless paper on your head. The COMEX can't print fake silver to meet demand, if they don't deliver when asked for delivery it's a default and silver immediately goes to $1000. SLV is where they can print infinite shares because nobody can take delivery on SLV except the very same banks who are shorting silver. Hence why people need to buy PSLV so that Sprott can keep draining the COMEX, or AG so that Keith Neumeyer can continue to refuse supplying it",Available-Major-3332,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la09rn/dont_listen_to_them_this_is_them_trying_to_take/glleuzu/,0.059,0.864,0.077,0.4981

EXPLANATION FOR WORRIED NEWBIE TRADERS 👇🏻

”The volume is low”.

What does this mean? The total volume of shares being moved around is LOW. The dips you are seeing are artificial and are NOT due to people selling shares. It’s illegal market manipulation at its finest.

Hedge funders sell their shares to each other at lower and lower bids (by tiny amounts) in rapid succession using bots. This tricks the algorithm into thinking a shit ton of shares are being dumped = the price is shown to go down.

In reality, no one is selling. Hedge funders are just moving shares between each other. If people were actually selling, you’d need at least 10x the volume to bring the price down like that.

So, stop panicking pussies. They’ve been doing this all week. Stop staring at your screen and watching every dollar movement. Go for a walk without a phone, have a shower, damn have breakfast if you haven’t already. Share this info to other newbie traders

here’s my part added on, you don’t have to credit my retardedness here, this is not financial advice I am a retard.


Look at the stock volume on any website, it’s nothing traded, this is a short ladder attack. Imagine negotiating a car. “My buddy Bill sold it for 1000 less then you are selling it for” then the guy selling says “ok, guess the car is worth less than I thought” even though it isn’t worth less. Same thing with GME. Wall Street is trying to devalue the stock hoping everyone will shit themselves and sell even though the stock isn’t actually losing value. Also they are curbing news coverage on GME and pushing it on silver to get the people who watch their news to buy silver over GME.

”The volume is low”.

What does this mean? The total volume of shares being moved around is LOW. The dips you are seeing are artificial and are NOT due to people selling shares. It’s illegal market manipulation at its finest.

Hedge funders sell their shares to each other at lower and lower bids (by tiny amounts) in rapid succession using bots. This tricks the algorithm into thinking a shit ton of shares are being dumped = the price is shown to go down.

In reality, no one is selling. Hedge funders are just moving shares between each other. If people were actually selling, you’d need at least 10x the volume to bring the price down like that.

-----

**Why are the share prices dropping?**

The hedgies cannot afford to pay us $1000's per share.

This is dropping, because they are using dirty tactics to try and make us crumble.

The hedgies are using lots of tactics, with the most common being short ladder attacks.

-----

**What is a short ladder attack in retard language?**

A short ladder attack is basically falsely manipulated stock prices.

Think of three people sitting around a table buying shares from the person to their left, and selling to the person on their right.

They are trading low volumes of shares at low prices to make it look like that is the real price of the share; thus impacting the market.

-----

**Why is holding so important?**

Every time you sell, the hedgie scrapes 0.xx% back.

Currently they're well over 100%, but everytime someone sells they drop this lower and lower.

It's going to take them a fucking long time to get it somewhere they're happy with, but the best thing you can do is **hold**.

**This also includes people selling to buy back in**, as this also allows the hedgie to shave off a small %

If you want to rebuy, so you get a better average per share, just hold and keep **buying the dips**.

This is the only way we can win.

**The hedges will drag this out for weeks/months if they are able to scrape small %s here and there.**

**Do NOT let them do this.**

-----

**If the hedgie cannot afford to pay us $1000 per share when should we sell?**

Good question, but it's just a figure of speech. The hedgie can afford to pay us $65k+ per share, but they don't want to make a loss.

They make a loss at anything over a few cents really, as they were basically betting that GME would go bankrupt.

But the higher the share price, the bigger a loss they make.

We are basically forcing them to buy from us at a price we set, but since we are millions of people, they can't make a deal with us and agree a set figure.

Therefore we are squeezing them, until the price rises up and up and up until we are happy, then we sell.

I'd say, sell anywhere from 5k to 10k per share, but I'm not a financial advisor, I'm just retarded.

**Don’t look at stock price, look at trading volume.**

The short ladder attack allows access to the window in, as well as out.

It tells us how many shares are being traded throughout the day and whether shares are being sold by us or HFs.

Low   volume with the price dropping generally means HFs are trading small   amounts of stocks to each other to drive the price down.

If  they're doing ladder shorts like  this, they're trying to drive the  price down so people will panic sell.  At some point, they still have to  buy back millions of shares to cover  themselves.

As  they drive the  price down, people panic sell and HFs buy those shares  to cover  themselves. If you sell, they can avoid the squeeze. They lose  pennies  per share every time they ladder sell, but that's *nothing* compared to the interest they're paying on the shorts they need to cover, and *that* is nothing compared to what they stand to lose if nobody sells their shares of GME as the price dips.

**This is what the shorts are doing right now.**

**Dont feel like reading a novel? The short and dirty (TLDR AT THE FUCKING BOTTOM):**

 
Short Attack:

1. Sell **fake**, COUNTERFEIT stocks between hedge funds and increasingly lower ask prices to try to scare other investors into selling and/or to trigger limit sell price points. They've been doing this all week. Each major price drop has been because of this tactic.


2. Get the media to spread fear, doubt, and uncertainty. Anyone watching CNBC this week has seen this in action.


3. Spread disinformation through ""analysis"" to get people to sell their stocks because ""the fundamentals aren't there"". Again, this is all over the place right now.


4. Open class action lawsuits against the company/shareholders claiming they're artificially inflating the stock price. Haven't seen it yet, but they've definitely threatened it.


5. Get the government/SEC involved alleging the same as #4. Definitely happening.


6. Pull margin shares and sell them. As seen being done by Robinhood over the last two days.


7. Spread FUD on message boards. Hello 4 million new subs pushing AMC, BB, SLV, etc.

Basically this past week has been 9/10 of the tactics in the short attack playbook to try to either push Gamestop into bankruptcy so they can profit on their short positions or slowly gain them back when people sell their stocks.

Confused what **counterfeited stock** means? Some light reading that /u/draemon_   provided explains it perfectly but beware, you actually have to read something:

* Jim Cramer, in a video-taped interview with The Street.com, best described the media function:

When (shorting) ... The hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful, because the truth is so against your view, (so the hedge funds) create a new 'truth' that is development of the fiction... you hit the brokerage houses with a series of orders (a short down ladder that pushes the price down), then we go to the press. You have a vicious cycle down - it's a pretty good game.*

**Yet more support for the at times illegal and unethical nature of these practices: (THANK YOU, /u/catolicquotes**

**Pulling Margin** from long customers during a short attack serves two purposes. Obviously the flood of shares that are “forced” sales help drive the price down, which aids the short cause in general. More important, for the broker dealers who clear for their retail customers at the same time they short against them, it creates a built-in source of cheap shares from which they can cover their open short positions.

Some of the **broker dealers short against their retail customers** from their proprietary trading desks, or “prop” desks. These are trades owned by the broker dealer, and, while they are not illegal, ethical questions certainly exist. The retail customers, who may be purchasing long investments that are being pushed by the broker dealer's retail network, have no inkling that the broker is taking a large short position contrary to the retail investor's position. With the encouragement of easy margin credit, i.e. 30% equity, the retail customers load up on stock and margin debt.

**The broker dealer, in concert with other shorts, may crash the stock by flooding the board with counterfeit shares, dropping the stock price**. The broker dealers know the amount of margin debt and the price at which their retail customers get into margin trouble. They can accelerate the squeeze on their retail customers by arbitrarily increasing the equity (percentage) requirement as the price is dropping, **frequently citing “volatility”**; which is really the shorts flooding the board with counterfeit shares.

The compounding effect of a dropping price and increasing equity requirement flushes out more shares. The broker dealers sometimes will take over the account during a margin sell-off. By engaging in poor trading practices, such as heavy selling over lunch hour; concentrated “dumps” of shares; hitting the bid with market orders; and conspiring with other trading desks, **they can further plummet the value of the stock and maximize the shares they have stripped from their retail customers**.

Most of the broker dealers who have both retail customers and prop-desk trading appear to engage in these practices. Goldman, Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch have been named in suits alleging these practices. Goldman made billions shorting against the subprime mortgage industry at the same time they were selling subprime investments to their customers.

322,BE,"  

Can we get a good copypasta writeup?? A few points to hit. Here's my best shot.

1. Why are we fighting? TO TAKE OUR FRIKING TENDIES BACK FROM WALLSTREET AND SEND THOSE SAME GREEDY F@KS TO GOD D@MN UNEMPLOYMENT LINE.

My Millennial ass wasn't around to get fucked in the 1990s dot com bubble or the 2008 housing crash BUT I was around to be raised in a world where if you don't have some kind of technical skills (and often times even if you do) you have to work 2+ jobs to pay rent AKA PAY FOR THEIR FUCKING PROPERTY FOR THEM, where your only out is an extra 4+ years of specialized education in college which they have jacked the price of so fuking high by the time your done your financially crippled and ready to suck the d1ck of the first company that's willing to hire just to get out of the 40k+ hole you were trapped into, where if you FINALLY find a way to win the game they freeze the God damn market (except for the sell option so they can get out of the one loss they have ever experienced in 30+ years) they use every media outlet possible to push COMMODITIES WE NEVER FUCKING TALK ABOUT and now they have invaded our LAST FUCKING space from paid off news (what else can you call that silver shit) with shills looking to confuse and divide us out the wazoo.

2. what can you do? This is not financial advice!!!? 💎🙌 your GME to the grave. You got GME? put your phone down. Play some fucking COD, Watch a new Netflix series, do whatever it is you like to do. The hard part is over. You have what they need! Sit on your fucking hands and don't let them firing at us from all sides with FUD and misinformation win.

My Millennial ass wasn't around to get fucked in the 1990s dot com bubble or the 2008 housing crash BUT I was around to be raised in a world where if you don't have some kind of technical skills (and often times even if you do) you have to work 2+ jobs to pay rent AKA PAY FOR THEIR FUCKING PROPERTY FOR THEM, where your only out is an extra 4+ years of specialized education in college which they have jacked the price of so fuking high by the time your done your financially crippled and ready to suck the d1ck of the first company that's willing to hire just to get out of the 40k+ hole you were trapped into, where if you FINALLY find a way to win the game they freeze the God damn market (except for the sell option so they can get out of the one loss they have ever experienced in 30+ years) they use every media outlet possible to push COMMODITIES WE NEVER FUCKING TALK ABOUT and now they have invaded our LAST FUCKING space from paid off news (what else can you call that silver shit) with shills looking to confuse and divide us out the wazoo.

Those who bought today totally got their money stolen, their arms fucking cut so that they couldnt diamond hand.

* At 11:17am today, Robin Hood showed volume of $50+ million. Combined with the huge drop in price to $210, this would call paper hand autists to sell. THIS VOLUME WAS INCORRECT

* By 12:16pm, Robin Hood had updated the volume to show it was only 22 million, 60% LESS than what it was an hour prior.

After the HFs eat their losses the stock is due for a big correction, is it not?

387,GME," **Listen here you absolute fucking apes**

SLV is shit because you don’t own it and it uses leased silver anyway, you can’t even get delivery unless you own 50,000 units and also must be an ‘approved buyer’.

**HOLD GME** and buy Physical silver after GME.

Buying anything other than physical is playing in the banks sandpit. They control the ability to create brand new futures contracts out of thin air to bring the spot price down. But spot price doesn’t mean shit if there is no silver to buy. The physical silver market extremely tight, 100% of yearly production gets used every year meanwhile on the paper markets 1-2 billion ounces get traded daily whilst a mere 750-850 million ounces are mined every year and even less than that in 2020, the already weak system is weaker now more than ever.

Have a read of the rest of my comment and take a look at some of the stuff I’ve linked. To be clear I’m not saying sell GME and go to silver, I’m saying once you’ve stuck it to the man for GME, let’s really stick it to all the banks that rely of this metals manipulation so that they can keep a fiat currency going and enjoy being the recipients of bailouts while you and your children inherit the invisible tax of inflation.

There may be some bots but I can assure you there is legitimacy to this argument.

**Physical silver is no trap, It is simply people who have been following the silver short for literal years and have become encouraged by the recent happenings in the market.**

Whatever your choice is ensure you absolutely **DO NOT BUY SLV, that is 100% a trap.**

The truth is, sure you’re sticking it to the man but other hedge funds are also making money - which I find no issue with but fundamentally you have not changed the system which allows this to happen. If you truely want to stick it to the man I urge you to do some research on silver whilst you enjoy holding GME as many of us are.

Some details here;

Silvers use is largely inelastic, whether it cost $20oz or $100oz apple will still buy it to make iPhones, Samsung will still buy it to make their phones, white goods companies will still purchase it to make their appliances. Those pushing for the green deals will not care about the price, they will just continue printing to fund their deals and this just plays into the cantillon effect.

The addition of investor demand will be too much for the fragile system. A system where silver is primarily produced as a byproduct/pollutant in the mining of other metals.

If silver goes up, it will take gold up with it, but it must be through silver because, as stated it is inelastic and almost 100% of production is used every year and in some cases such as this year more than 100%. With gold, the central banks can easily flood the market and we will quickly run out of cash with which to buy the gold that comes out of cold storage.

Silver is the Achilles heel of the financial system, as silver goes up - gold must follow; if gold follows then confidence in the dollar is lost since gold is generally a fear trade (let’s not forget bonds have a negative real yield). If confidence in the dollar is lost, central banks must revert to honest money. The most likely and least disruptive way this would occur is by a revaluation of the price of gold and silver relative to the amount of fiat dollars that exist. The banks have been buying gold for years in anticipation of such an event. They are well aware of what they’re doing.

You can find a pretty comprehensive report on silver in the In Gold We Trust Report on and after page 249;

Everyone just Google the word ""silver"" and look at the news. They are using the media to try and manipulate the price of silver to go up which hedge funds apparently own large portions of in a desperate attempt to trick non-redditors into buying silver. They are saying we all are going in on silver and that it is ""surging"" even though it only just went up 3 dollars since the last week.

514,MSFT," I guess that's ok.. i mean they need cap to keep paying us and if boomers want to finance this mess let them or am i missing something?

Edit:

It's either this or they continue to sell long stock positions like MSFT.

Them selling msft causes the main market to dive. This gives autists a good deal but the reddit short squeeze a bad image.

Tricking retards into silver gives them the cap to pay us without the rest of the market taking a hit.

They don't want to have to sell msft and they can easily mine more silver. God ppl that watch cnbc are dopes

Either gaybear way i don't care and just want to get paid.

Edit 2: ok I'm right but they might of locked up the long positions when they took equity deals so silver is the last great hope.

555,JP," I think most people are missing the story on Silver. This is not about trying to corner the Silver market like the Hunt brothers did in 1979 but overcoming the market manipulation of JP Morgan in the metals markets.

There is virtually no Silver above ground for delivery - the price should be tens of dollars per ounce higher. But it is not due to JP Morgan and the other Wall Street Banks continually having huge shorts in this market to artificially lower the price.

If every small investor with an interest in stopping the market manipulation and the excessive profits of these thieving Wall Street banks had to buy just 5 ounces of silver each, it would drive these market manipulators into bankruptcy and ensure that the little man is not constantly nailed, like they normally are. This is a great movement that has been started, and metal market are prime candidates for stopping the unfair manipulation of these banks. This is totally different to the Hunt brothers attempt in 1979.

621,GME," Well.... The problem is, to make gains (profit) you need to sell your GME. But ! To sell it, you will need people willing to buy. Otherwise your profit will just stay on paper.

You should take care. Once that massive short-squeeze is covered, what made the made price shoot up in the first place because some guys where forced to cover, who should take the stock of your hands ?

This will finally end with a blood bath on the upside, just as it did on the downside.... There will be many good people who bought GME at prices like 300 or 400 that will get knocked out. Hopefully no one invested his life savings into this bubble.

True, but this POV seems to be pretty unpopular here. YES, there are a ton of people on here who literally will hold from $500 down to $0 out of pure spite/principal. Those people are very vocal but I think for every 1 willing to ride it all the way down, 9 or more others are planning to sell at whatever peak they think is coming, just on this sub. There's plenty more who have bought GME based on what they've read/heard in the last week and are only looking to ride the wave

The truth is a lot of people that did invest money they can't (or at least shouldn't) lose are going to be stuck holding a back they didn't want. Those people are taking a risk just like the hedgies did in shorting GME originally, but it doesn't mean we can't feel bad for them. I certainly applaud those in it for the long haul, but a lot of paper hands are going to get destroyed because they bought into hype they read here",julius_sphincter,6,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la1o04/there_is_no_silver_short_squeeze_happening_none/glmiqi5/,0.053,0.795,0.152,0.9689

SLV is shit because you don’t own it and it uses leased silver anyway, you can’t even get delivery unless you own 50,000 units and also must be an ‘approved buyer’.

**HOLD GME** and buy Physical silver after GME.

Buying anything other than physical is playing in the banks sandpit. They control the ability to create brand new futures contracts out of thin air to bring the spot price down. But spot price doesn’t mean shit if there is no silver to buy. The physical silver market extremely tight, 100% of yearly production gets used every year meanwhile on the paper markets 1-2 billion ounces get traded daily whilst a mere 750-850 million ounces are mined every year and even less than that in 2020, the already weak system is weaker now more than ever.

To be clear I’m not saying sell GME and go to silver, I’m saying once you’ve stuck it to the man for GME, let’s really stick it to all the banks that rely of this metals manipulation so that they can keep a fiat currency going and enjoy being the recipients of bailouts while you and your children inherit the invisible tax of inflation.

There may be some bots but I can assure you there is legitimacy to this argument.

**Physical silver is no trap, It is simply people who have been following the silver short for literal years and have become encouraged by the recent happenings in the market.**

Whatever your choice is ensure you absolutely **DO NOT BUY SLV, that is 100% a trap.**

The truth is, sure you’re sticking it to the man but other hedge funds are also making money - which I find no issue with but fundamentally you have not changed the system which allows this to happen. If you truely want to stick it to the man I urge you to do some research on silver whilst you enjoy holding GME as many of us are.

Some details here;

Silvers use is largely inelastic, whether it cost $20oz or $100oz apple will still buy it to make iPhones, Samsung will still buy it to make their phones, white goods companies will still purchase it to make their appliances. Those pushing for the green deals will not care about the price, they will just continue printing to fund their deals and this just plays into the cantillon effect.

The addition of investor demand will be too much for the fragile system. A system where silver is primarily produced as a byproduct/pollutant in the mining of other metals.

If silver goes up, it will take gold up with it, but it must be through silver because, as stated it is inelastic and almost 100% of production is used every year and in some cases such as this year more than 100%. With gold, the central banks can easily flood the market and we will quickly run out of cash with which to buy the gold that comes out of cold storage.

Silver is the Achilles heel of the financial system, as silver goes up - gold must follow; if gold follows then confidence in the dollar is lost since gold is generally a fear trade (let’s not forget bonds have a negative real yield). If confidence in the dollar is lost, central banks must revert to honest money. The most likely and least disruptive way this would occur is by a revaluation of the price of gold and silver relative to the amount of fiat dollars that exist. The banks have been buying gold for years in anticipation of such an event. They are well aware of what they’re doing.

You can find a pretty comprehensive report on silver in the In Gold We Trust Report on and after page 249;

863,GME," No, be careful. Calls and puts don't work like that. Calls and puts are called 'options' which is what this image is referencing They are fractional. The reason DFV has so much money is because of his calls. He was able to buy them for .12 cents for the right to sell 100\*500 shares on April 16 2021. So basically he bet $100 that GME would be more than $12 on that date. If he is right he could make whatever the share price is on that day, -$12, times how many options he has, which are 500. Since each is the right to buy 100, its really 50,000. So when you see DFVs account, right now if GME is 330, well, $330-$12 is $318. $318\*500\*100=$15,900,000 that is being reported as his profits. This is the same principle with this silver position. So these mother fuckers are betting still large amounts, but the payoffs are enormous if they can manipulate enough. In October or 2020 Citadel had $35 billion under management.

First of all there's no way WSB alone is going to be able to squeeze a market that big.

Second, it's a blatant fact that the silver price is being held down, manipulated. Where's the bloody inflation on the silver chart?

Third, **Citadel doesn't really ""own"" SLV**, they clear brokers whose individual investors do. Hedge funds do not invest in metals, they're not made for that.

Fourth, **it's not because someone you don't like is bullish on something that you shouldn't be**. Yes, even Citron has done magnificent trades. Trading against someone for the sake of trading against someone isn't going to make you money.

# TLDR : Hold GME 💎🤲  for now, and do whatever the fuck you want next with your tendies. Silver ain't a bad play, but fuck those ETFs since we have been shown that we can't trust the market anymore. Get silver bullion delivered straight to your house and sleep over the damn thing.

Infact, if you get locked out of the US market, i would like to point out that gamestop is traded on the borse frankfurt as well. And according to my trader DeGiro, GME had 1,7 million volume on the US exchange, and <44,000 volume in euros. And yknow, if there's a price difference between the US and EU price, the HFT traders will arbitrade that down to equal price. Do with that info what you will.

But i'm TELLING you! The mining deficit is real! The suppression of the gold and silver price is REAL! There has been delivery wall after delivery wall since April 2020 on the Comex. IT WAS NEVER DESIGNED FOR THAT! We even have signs that the LBMA is running out:

GME is an earthquake. It's going to lay some serious fucking damage down and the epicenter is, let's say it's off the coast of Seattle. Some serious waves are going to hit the coast there.

If we can force the price up they will be forced to deliver and subsequently (if they don’t have the bullion) they will have to purchase the physical at astronomical prices, killing their bullion books and taking these banks to the cleaners. KEY IS BANKS NOT HEDGES.

916,GME," Listen up retards. Use your smooth brains best you can. The new shill is saying buy and hold GME only. What if it’s possible that banks and hedges are so afraid of the silver squeeze and lack of physical silver that they are now promoting you to only buy GME because losing a hundred billion is less bad than tanking the entire financial system. You 🦍 wanna burn this mother down or not? GME was just the start. Physical silver shock will break way more than a few hedgers, and it has already begun.

Its most definitely a squeeze and a money making opportunity. Not everyone needs to buy overpriced GME at 350 a share. There will be bag holders who get fucked. 

Also this post mentioned buying silver helping hedge funds. It will help some and hurt other just like GME. And personally my opinion is if it hurts hedge funds cool, if they make money so what its about you making money.

935,GME," I dunno, as weary as I am it seems to line up too good...chart brings a 20 week cup and handle, big picture we got a 40 year cup and handle!!! The buying lately has been insane. There’s currently 800k (80m shares) set to expire ITM at 30$ March 19 on $SLV, that’s ~2.5b in silver. Another 600k contracts (60m shares) between 30$ and 50$ on March 19 means ANOTHER ~2.5b. Mid 2020 Eric sprott spent 1.5b on 75m ounces of physical silver at 20$/oz, this drove the price up 50%. There’s 40% less silver than gold above ground, silver trades at 1/73 the price of gold while is produced naturally at an 8:1 ratio. Anyone with a brain can tell you this makes no sense. What this tells me is it’s like a spring that been coiled up, waiting to release its energy and its right under everyone’s nose. I remember being young and learning gold was like 1400 while silver was 10$..made no sense to me then, still doesn’t now. Even if this is the banks playing fuckery, they biggest 6 hold ~43m shares of SLV combined, that’s a measly 6.7%. There’s going to be more calls ITM March 16 at open tomorrow then their holdings. It’s a no brainer. Even if this is the banks trying to draw us in, the conditions couldn’t be more against them, and it’s going to backfire hard. This one ain’t just us, the pressure has been building all year. The heavy buying over the past weeks has not been WSB, it wasn’t on the radar before Wednesday. There’s big, smart money already behind this. I’m not trying to take away from gme here, but there can be more than one event unfolding before us. Can’t walk around with tunnel vision when something so technically obvious is happening. GME may have been the catalyst to a new strategy, one that big money can get behind. One with much bigger sharks to prey on. Please don’t dismiss this opportunity, the signs are all there. Might be a good idea to diversify some spare change, can’t buy half a share of gme so we will have some change to spare.

1002,GME," Where the fuck are you seeing that they lose 30% per day on GME interest?

If you're talking about the interest rate for the shares they borrowed, that percentage is annualized. For retards who don't know what annualized means it means it's 30% divided by 365. Also their borrow rate can change day-to-day depending on the demand for the stock. **If they borrowed 100,000 shares and it closes at $300.00 and they don't sell the shares that means they have to pay $30,000,000/365 at the end of the day which makes it $82,191.78 for that single day.** This is a very affordable maintenance program for such a huge hedge fund.

I'm not entirely sure where people are getting figured that Citadel is losing billions per day because they haven't lost anything until they actually close out their positions and they can probably afford to maintain these positions for months if they have to. 

Furthermore, Citadel holds roughly 1.4 Billion in various SLV positions. **PSLV is no better than SLV** because they're both backed by physical silver and you can *technically* request delivery of silver through those vehicles except they both require you to be an ""approved"" trader, SLV requires that you call at least 50,000 shares and PSLV requires that you call at least 10,000 troy oz which currently is about 25,000 shares.

Attaching to the top comment so someone might be able to help. I’m trying to buy more AMC right now on Vanguard, but it’s telling me I don’t have enough for even 1 share, even though I have multiple thousands in my account where it says “funds available to trade”. No idea was going on. But I’m trying to buy at the dip right now, can anyone help?

Edit: someone DMed me saying that vanguard enacted a new policy (as of this morning)  that you can’t buy stocks with “funds transferred within the last 7 days”. Which is total BS. 

I’m currently trying to set up a fidelity account, but I can’t seem to find a way to get my bank account linked to transfer funds immediately. If anyone can help with this it would be greatly appreciated

Edit 2: for some reason 90% of your reply’s won’t show up in the thread, so I can only read as much as my notification ribbon shows when it pops up. So for the people suggesting I use cash app; if i don’t already have cash app, can I download the apps and link a a bank account immediately, or will it take time to link?  Thanks in advance.

Final (hopefully) Edit:  I can confirm through personal phone call with vanguards service line, you are not able to purchase stocks with recently transferred money from a separate bank account. They employee said this is specifically due to the high volume and volatility of the recent events. Luckily, I had money in a vanguard mutual fund that I will be liquidating, and will be immediately able to buy more AMC.

Just Google the word ""silver"" and look at the news. They are using the media to try and manipulate the price of silver to go up which hedge funds apparently own large portions of in a desperate attempt to trick non-redditors into buying silver. They are saying we all are going in on silver and that it is ""surging"" even though it only just went up 3 dollars since last week. Any profits they make from manipulating the price silver, they will use to try and cover their GME shorts. Please pass this info along.

”The volume is low”.

What does this mean? The total volume of shares being moved around is LOW. The dips you are seeing are artificial and are NOT due to people selling shares. It’s illegal market manipulation at its finest.

Hedge funders sell their shares to each other at lower and lower bids (by tiny amounts) in rapid succession using bots. This tricks the algorithm into thinking a shit ton of shares are being dumped = the price is shown to go down.

In reality, no one is selling. Hedge funders are just moving shares between each other. If people were actually selling, you’d need at least 10x the volume to bring the price down like that.

I’m not going to majorly benefit from all this, no matter what happens. 

I realized today that just knowing that we’re all out here workin hard to stick it to the fucks that continuously fuck with our economy and then drink champagne after they’ve ruined millions of lives makes me really happy.

They are trying to force people to sell out of their position once they release the flood gates and cover their shorts which will inevitably boost the price of GME to new AH or very close ~450-550. Imo I think thats their goal. All this nonsense right now is a distraction and to get data on what the optimal price they should boost GME to which will hopefully trigger a massive sell off.

Let’s say that there are 10,000 shares of GME. And let’s say that 9,999 of us have diamond hands and are never selling. If that one person (who’s not part of the 9,999) goes and sells their one share of GME, and there’s only one offer to buy that share, and the offer is $5 per share, then GME is currently trading at $5. 

In this way, low volume of trades (in this example, one share being sold one time) doesn’t reflect the real demand for GME, but instead, reflects that one sale — because what *really* reflects the real demand for GME is the 9,999 of us that aren’t selling.

If they're doing ladder shorts like this, they're trying to drive the price down so people will panic sell. At some point, they still have to buy back millions of shares to cover themselves.

As they drive the price down, people panic sell and HFs buy those shares to cover themselves. If you sell, they can avoid the squeeze. They lose pennies per share every time they ladder sell, but that's *nothing* compared to the interest they're paying on the shorts they need to cover, and *that* is nothing compared to what they stand to lose if nobody sells their shares of GME as the price dips.

If retailers dont buy and sell much stock, and HF buy and sell them millions at a time. 

When the squeeze happens, volume will spike for about a month going into it while they reposition, once the squeeze ends, volume will plummet. Just like it has on GME.

Does this mean the squeeze has squoze? No. Does it mean we are winning? No. So what does it mean??? Nothing. It means exactly what you want it to mean, and you can twist the narrative into a negative or a positive depending on which bias you want to confirm.

**Why are the share prices dropping?**

The hedgies cannot afford to pay us $1000's per share.

This is dropping, because they are using dirty tactics to try and make us crumble.

The hedgies are using lots of tactics, with the most common being short ladder attacks.

-----

**What is a short ladder attack in retard language?**

A short ladder attack is basically falsely manipulated stock prices.

Think of three people sitting around a table buying shares from the person to their left, and selling to the person on their right.

They are trading low volumes of shares at low prices to make it look like that is the real price of the share; thus impacting the market.

-----

**Why is holding so important?**

Every time you sell, the hedgie scrapes 0.xx% back.

Currently they're well over 100%, but everytime someone sells they drop this lower and lower.

It's going to take them a fucking long time to get it somewhere they're happy with, but the best thing you can do is **hold**.

**This also includes people selling to buy back in**, as this also allows the hedgie to shave off a small %

If you want to rebuy, so you get a better average per share, just hold and keep **buying the dips**.

This is the only way we can win.

**The hedges will drag this out for weeks/months if they are able to scrape small %s here and there.**

**Do NOT let them do this.**

-----

**If the hedgie cannot afford to pay us $1000 per share when should we sell?**

Good question, but it's just a figure of speech. The hedgie can afford to pay us $65k+ per share, but they don't want to make a loss.

They make a loss at anything over a few cents really, as they were basically betting that GME would go bankrupt.

But the higher the share price, the bigger a loss they make.

We are basically forcing them to buy from us at a price we set, but since we are millions of people, they can't make a deal with us and agree a set figure.

Therefore we are squeezing them, until the price rises up and up and up until we are happy, then we sell.

I'd say, sell anywhere from 5k to 10k per share, but I'm not a financial advisor, I'm just retarded.

Good question, but it's just a figure of speech. The hedgie can afford to pay us $65k+ per share, but they don't want to make a loss.

They make a loss at anything over a few cents really, as they were basically betting that GME would go bankrupt.

But the higher the share price, the bigger a loss they make.

We are basically forcing them to buy from us at a price we set, but since we are millions of people, they can't make a deal with us and agree a set figure.

Therefore we are squeezing them, until the price rises up and up and up until we are happy, then we sell.

I'd say, sell anywhere from 5k to 10k per share, but I'm not a financial advisor, I'm just retarded.

#TL;DR:

THE ONLY WAY WE CAN 100% WIN IS IF YOU DO NOT FUCKING SELL. I DON'T CARE IF YOU'RE REBUYING BACK IN AT A LOWER PRICE ON A DIP. DO NOT SELL. BUY MORE STOCKS ON DIPS, BUT DO NOT SELL.

**Why are the share prices dropping?**

The hedgies cannot afford to pay us $1000's per share.

This is dropping, because they are using dirty tactics to try and make us crumble.

The hedgies are using lots of tactics, with the most common being short ladder attacks.

-----

**What is a short ladder attack in retard language?**

A short ladder attack is basically falsely manipulated stock prices.

Think of three people sitting around a table buying shares from the person to their left, and selling to the person on their right.

They are trading low volumes of shares at low prices to make it look like that is the real price of the share; thus impacting the market.

-----

**Why is holding so important?**

Every time you sell, the hedgie scrapes 0.xx% back.

Currently they're well over 100%, but everytime someone sells they drop this lower and lower.

It's going to take them a fucking long time to get it somewhere they're happy with, but the best thing you can do is **hold**.

**This also includes people selling to buy back in**, as this also allows the hedgie to shave off a small %

If you want to rebuy, so you get a better average per share, just hold and keep **buying the dips**.

This is the only way we can win.

**The hedges will drag this out for weeks/months if they are able to scrape small %s here and there.**

**Do NOT let them do this.**

IM A SMART MONKEY WITH A PHD IN NEGOTIATIONS /PLEASE DONT DELETE AGAIN /PLEASE OR TELL ME WHAT TO CHANGE /PLZ

Alright everybody - as a monkey I will try to make this short and strategic. Get my VISION!

This is OUR current trajectory: the army keep buying and holding - Wallstreet is not only fixing the counterfeit stocks but at the same time CLOSING the short positions slowly. They keep prices from going to high thus keeping their losses to a minimum. In a week or so this will be fixed. Prices will decline and most of us will be holding STOCKS WE LOVE.

Then - class action against RH, Citadel, the clearinghouses heck we will probably try and sue the SEC for blatant disregard of the law. And to WIN these need to be organized and well orchestrated steps in order to even get traction. But we ARE DECENTALIZED and INDEPENDENT RETAIL MONKEYS.

Spoiler alert: These cases will drag out for years - everyone holding stock at XYZ date will be able to participate and there might be a settlement. Guess what wont happen - nobody is going to jail. They will have covered their trails, paid lawmakers and judges just to keep doing business as usual being more careful not to get caught by the public with their pants down AGAIN.

THIS IS HOW WE WIN:

This Wednesday we make a stand - everyone in retail and I mean everyone puts in a sell order for $4269 or something like ""similar to"" that. THIS IS THE MOON. HEAR ME OUT - THIS OUR SETTLEMENT - ON OUR TERMS.

WHAT THIS MEANS FOR US:

Everyone of us wins and wins big - if you came in to help retail last week at $550 you x8 your money. Most support at $250-$350 will 12x their money. The majority of the army at around $50 will 90x their money and beyond that your going to Pluto anyway my friend.

Now we have more MONEY which means more POWER not on just on Wall Street but in real life this buying power means something but only now - not if the stock drops to $50 - and we WON the negotiations at the table. Wall Street will not change the way we think but they will be SCARED and SCARED for GOOD.

Their losses will be huge and only if we end up TAKING the CASH will it be PAIN. They might need a bailout and if the market can't support it - they will ask UNCLE SAM, after all ""they are to big to fail"". This would be the FIRST BAIL OUT not for banks or insurance companies but to SETTLE WITH US.

WHY THEY WILL TAKE IT:

Right now they don't even have an OUT. They had to close all trading to stop an infinity squeeze and at this point none related parties are trying to make the system not collapse. Prices will go to infinity if we hold to infinity. THIS WONT HAPPEN. WHAT WILL HAPPEN is taking our settlement: MAKES THIS ""GO AWAY"" with so much pain but the pain outweighs the risk - the risk of someone going to jail or a whistleblower outing the illegal activity undoubtedly.

And THIS IS WHY WE BEAT - OUTSTRATEGIZED THEM. THEY ARE A MACHINE AND WE KNOW HOW IT WORKS - PAIN AND LOSSES outweigh INFINITY RISK that includes ""who knows what the fuck will happen"" and they will take the loss and the pain.

Taking their money now - is the most PAIN we can give them - they will loose BILLIONS AGAIN - they change their ways because they can't risk this same scenario again.

THIS WOULD BE REAL CHANGE - THEY WILL BE SCARED OF US - WE WILL HAVE MORE STRENGHT - MORE BUYING POWER and LEVERAGE BECAUSE WE WON AT THE NEGOTIATING TABLE ON OUR TERMS:

PAY US fair market VALUE for this situation: EVERYBODY IN RETAIL WON THIS BET. GAMESTOP WILL NOT BE BANKRUPTED - IT WILL SURVIVE - WE MADE OUR STAND - WON BIG and KEEP ON POLICING WITH OUR NEW WEALTH.

PLEASE DONT DELETE THIS - WE NEED TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION AND I HOPE a FEW MONKEYs with degrees can support me here and make more sophisticated comments to support this strategy and then lets get all our Monkeys on board. If its $4269 I think we all WIN or pick a percentage. THIS IS THE MOON. THESE ARE OUR STARS and LETS KEEP THE ROCKET FLYING. CASH IS ROCKETFUEL and WE ARE TAKING OUR FUEL from Melvin and Citadel.

THEY ARE MAKING MOVES

THIS IS OUR FINAL MOVE - they don't buy we end up in the same position anyway - if they don't take it at the negotiating table we sue them etc. etc. but AT LEAST we tried to settle and not at infinity, not at PLUTO for all of us (if you invested pre-$50 your leaving the Milky Way on a spaceship made of Tendies) but the MOON like we said - we are NOT GREEDY. WE DONT WANT INIFINITY - THE MOON THOUGH - WITH THEIR MONEY - REAL MONEY not digits that they manipulate.

THEY ARE SCARED OF THIS TACTIC - WE DO THIS - THEY DONT TAKE IT - WE HAVE A PRECIDENT FOR COURT.

THEY WILL TAKE IT - TRUST ME - IN THE END THIS IS A MACHINE - THE MACHINE HAS TO ELIMINATE RISK - the option right now is INFITY BUST (unacceptable) or do everything illegal to safe your ass (of course they do this) - WE NEED TO CHANGE OUR POSITION TO:

Alright everybody - as a monkey I will try to make this short and strategic. Get my VISION!

This is OUR current trajectory: the army keep buying and holding - Wallstreet is not only fixing the counterfeit stocks but at the same time CLOSING the short positions slowly. They keep prices from going to high thus keeping their losses to a minimum. In a week or so this will be fixed. Prices will decline and most of us will be holding STOCKS WE LOVE.

Then - class action against RH, Citadel, the clearinghouses heck we will probably try and sue the SEC for blatant disregard of the law. And to WIN these need to be organized and well orchestrated steps in order to even get traction. But we ARE DECENTALIZED and INDEPENDENT RETAIL MONKEYS.

Spoiler alert: These cases will drag out for years - everyone holding stock at XYZ date will be able to participate and there might be a settlement. Guess what wont happen - nobody is going to jail. They will have covered their trails, paid lawmakers and judges just to keep doing business as usual being more careful not to get caught by the public with their pants down AGAIN.

THIS IS HOW WE WIN:

This Wednesday we make a stand - everyone in retail and I mean everyone puts in a sell order for $4269 or something like ""similar to"" that. THIS IS THE MOON. HEAR ME OUT - THIS OUR SETTLEMENT - ON OUR TERMS.

WHAT THIS MEANS FOR US:

Everyone of us wins and wins big - if you came in to help retail last week at $550 you x8 your money. Most support at $250-$350 will 12x their money. The majority of the army at around $50 will 90x their money and beyond that your going to Pluto anyway my friend.

Now we have more MONEY which means more POWER not on just on Wall Street but in real life this buying power means something but only now - not if the stock drops to $50 - and we WON the negotiations at the table. Wall Street will not change the way we think but they will be SCARED and SCARED for GOOD.

Their losses will be huge and only if we end up TAKING the CASH will it be PAIN. They might need a bailout and if the market can't support it - they will ask UNCLE SAM, after all ""they are to big to fail"". This would be the FIRST BAIL OUT not for banks or insurance companies but to SETTLE WITH US.

WHY THEY WILL TAKE IT:

Right now they don't even have an OUT. They had to close all trading to stop an infinity squeeze and at this point none related parties are trying to make the system not collapse. Prices will go to infinity if we hold to infinity. THIS WONT HAPPEN. WHAT WILL HAPPEN is taking our settlement: MAKES THIS ""GO AWAY"" with so much pain but the pain outweighs the risk - the risk of someone going to jail or a whistleblower outing the illegal activity undoubtedly.

And THIS IS WHY WE BEAT - OUTSTRATEGIZED THEM. THEY ARE A MACHINE AND WE KNOW HOW IT WORKS - PAIN AND LOSSES outweigh INFINITY RISK that includes ""who knows what the fuck will happen"" and they will take the loss and the pain.

Taking their money now - is the most PAIN we can give them - they will loose BILLIONS AGAIN - they change their ways because they can't risk this same scenario again.

THIS WOULD BE REAL CHANGE - THEY WILL BE SCARED OF US - WE WILL HAVE MORE STRENGHT - MORE BUYING POWER and LEVERAGE BECAUSE WE WON AT THE NEGOTIATING TABLE ON OUR TERMS:

PAY US fair market VALUE for this situation: EVERYBODY IN RETAIL WON THIS BET. GAMESTOP WILL NOT BE BANKRUPTED - IT WILL SURVIVE - WE MADE OUR STAND - WON BIG and KEEP ON POLICING WITH OUR NEW WEALTH.

PLEASE DONT DELETE THIS - WE NEED TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION AND I HOPE a FEW MONKEYs with degrees can support me here and make more sophisticated comments to support this strategy and then lets get all our Monkeys on board. If its $4269 I think we all WIN or pick a percentage. THIS IS THE MOON. THESE ARE OUR STARS and LETS KEEP THE ROCKET FLYING. CASH IS ROCKETFUEL and WE ARE TAKING OUR FUEL from Melvin and Citadel.

THEY ARE MAKING MOVES

THIS IS OUR FINAL MOVE - they don't buy we end up in the same position anyway - if they don't take it at the negotiating table we sue them etc. etc. but AT LEAST we tried to settle and not at infinity, not at PLUTO for all of us (if you invested pre-$50 your leaving the Milky Way on a spaceship made of Tendies) but the MOON like we said - we are NOT GREEDY. WE DONT WANT INIFINITY - THE MOON THOUGH - WITH THEIR MONEY - REAL MONEY not digits that they manipulate.

Then - class action against RH, Citadel, the clearinghouses heck we will probably try and sue the SEC for blatant disregard of the law. And to WIN these need to be organized and well orchestrated steps in order to even get traction. But we ARE DECENTALIZED and INDEPENDENT RETAIL MONKEYS.

Spoiler alert: These cases will drag out for years - everyone holding stock at XYZ date will be able to participate and there might be a settlement. Guess what wont happen - nobody is going to jail. They will have covered their trails, paid lawmakers and judges just to keep doing business as usual being more careful not to get caught by the public with their pants down AGAIN.

THIS IS HOW WE WIN:

This Wednesday we make a stand - everyone in retail and I mean everyone puts in a sell order for $4269 or something like ""similar to"" that. THIS IS THE MOON. HEAR ME OUT - THIS OUR SETTLEMENT - ON OUR TERMS.

WHAT THIS MEANS FOR US:

Everyone of us wins and wins big - if you came in to help retail last week at $550 you x8 your money. Most support at $250-$350 will 12x their money. The majority of the army at around $50 will 90x their money and beyond that your going to Pluto anyway my friend.

Now we have more MONEY which means more POWER not on just on Wall Street but in real life this buying power means something but only now - not if the stock drops to $50 - and we WON the negotiations at the table. Wall Street will not change the way we think but they will be SCARED and SCARED for GOOD.

Their losses will be huge and only if we end up TAKING the CASH will it be PAIN. They might need a bailout and if the market can't support it - they will ask UNCLE SAM, after all ""they are to big to fail"". This would be the FIRST BAIL OUT not for banks or insurance companies but to SETTLE WITH US.

WHY THEY WILL TAKE IT:

Right now they don't even have an OUT. They had to close all trading to stop an infinity squeeze and at this point none related parties are trying to make the system not collapse. Prices will go to infinity if we hold to infinity. THIS WONT HAPPEN. WHAT WILL HAPPEN is taking our settlement: MAKES THIS ""GO AWAY"" with so much pain but the pain outweighs the risk - the risk of someone going to jail or a whistleblower outing the illegal activity undoubtedly.

And THIS IS WHY WE BEAT - OUTSTRATEGIZED THEM. THEY ARE A MACHINE AND WE KNOW HOW IT WORKS - PAIN AND LOSSES outweigh INFINITY RISK that includes ""who knows what the fuck will happen"" and they will take the loss and the pain.

Taking their money now - is the most PAIN we can give them - they will loose BILLIONS AGAIN - they change their ways because they can't risk this same scenario again.

THIS WOULD BE REAL CHANGE - THEY WILL BE SCARED OF US - WE WILL HAVE MORE STRENGHT - MORE BUYING POWER and LEVERAGE BECAUSE WE WON AT THE NEGOTIATING TABLE ON OUR TERMS:

PAY US fair market VALUE for this situation: EVERYBODY IN RETAIL WON THIS BET. GAMESTOP WILL NOT BE BANKRUPTED - IT WILL SURVIVE - WE MADE OUR STAND - WON BIG and KEEP ON POLICING WITH OUR NEW WEALTH.

PLEASE DONT DELETE THIS - WE NEED TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION AND I HOPE a FEW MONKEYs with degrees can support me here and make more sophisticated comments to support this strategy and then lets get all our Monkeys on board. If its $4269 I think we all WIN or pick a percentage. THIS IS THE MOON. THESE ARE OUR STARS and LETS KEEP THE ROCKET FLYING. CASH IS ROCKETFUEL and WE ARE TAKING OUR FUEL from Melvin and Citadel.

THEY ARE MAKING MOVES

THIS IS OUR FINAL MOVE - they don't buy we end up in the same position anyway - if they don't take it at the negotiating table we sue them etc. etc. but AT LEAST we tried to settle and not at infinity, not at PLUTO for all of us (if you invested pre-$50 your leaving the Milky Way on a spaceship made of Tendies) but the MOON like we said - we are NOT GREEDY. WE DONT WANT INIFINITY - THE MOON THOUGH - WITH THEIR MONEY - REAL MONEY not digits that they manipulate.

THEY ARE SCARED OF THIS TACTIC - WE DO THIS - THEY DONT TAKE IT - WE HAVE A PRECIDENT FOR COURT.

THEY WILL TAKE IT - TRUST ME - IN THE END THIS IS A MACHINE - THE MACHINE HAS TO ELIMINATE RISK - the option right now is INFITY BUST (unacceptable) or do everything illegal to safe your ass (of course they do this) - WE NEED TO CHANGE OUR POSITION TO:

Everyone of us wins and wins big - if you came in to help retail last week at $550 you x8 your money. Most support at $250-$350 will 12x their money. The majority of the army at around $50 will 90x their money and beyond that your going to Pluto anyway my friend.

Now we have more MONEY which means more POWER not on just on Wall Street but in real life this buying power means something but only now - not if the stock drops to $50 - and we WON the negotiations at the table. Wall Street will not change the way we think but they will be SCARED and SCARED for GOOD.

Their losses will be huge and only if we end up TAKING the CASH will it be PAIN. They might need a bailout and if the market can't support it - they will ask UNCLE SAM, after all ""they are to big to fail"". This would be the FIRST BAIL OUT not for banks or insurance companies but to SETTLE WITH US.

WHY THEY WILL TAKE IT:

Right now they don't even have an OUT. They had to close all trading to stop an infinity squeeze and at this point none related parties are trying to make the system not collapse. Prices will go to infinity if we hold to infinity. THIS WONT HAPPEN. WHAT WILL HAPPEN is taking our settlement: MAKES THIS ""GO AWAY"" with so much pain but the pain outweighs the risk - the risk of someone going to jail or a whistleblower outing the illegal activity undoubtedly.

And THIS IS WHY WE BEAT - OUTSTRATEGIZED THEM. THEY ARE A MACHINE AND WE KNOW HOW IT WORKS - PAIN AND LOSSES outweigh INFINITY RISK that includes ""who knows what the fuck will happen"" and they will take the loss and the pain.

Taking their money now - is the most PAIN we can give them - they will loose BILLIONS AGAIN - they change their ways because they can't risk this same scenario again.

THIS WOULD BE REAL CHANGE - THEY WILL BE SCARED OF US - WE WILL HAVE MORE STRENGHT - MORE BUYING POWER and LEVERAGE BECAUSE WE WON AT THE NEGOTIATING TABLE ON OUR TERMS:

PAY US fair market VALUE for this situation: EVERYBODY IN RETAIL WON THIS BET. GAMESTOP WILL NOT BE BANKRUPTED - IT WILL SURVIVE - WE MADE OUR STAND - WON BIG and KEEP ON POLICING WITH OUR NEW WEALTH.

PLEASE DONT DELETE THIS - WE NEED TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION AND I HOPE a FEW MONKEYs with degrees can support me here and make more sophisticated comments to support this strategy and then lets get all our Monkeys on board. If its $4269 I think we all WIN or pick a percentage. THIS IS THE MOON. THESE ARE OUR STARS and LETS KEEP THE ROCKET FLYING. CASH IS ROCKETFUEL and WE ARE TAKING OUR FUEL from Melvin and Citadel.

THEY ARE MAKING MOVES

THIS IS OUR FINAL MOVE - they don't buy we end up in the same position anyway - if they don't take it at the negotiating table we sue them etc. etc. but AT LEAST we tried to settle and not at infinity, not at PLUTO for all of us (if you invested pre-$50 your leaving the Milky Way on a spaceship made of Tendies) but the MOON like we said - we are NOT GREEDY. WE DONT WANT INIFINITY - THE MOON THOUGH - WITH THEIR MONEY - REAL MONEY not digits that they manipulate.

THEY ARE SCARED OF THIS TACTIC - WE DO THIS - THEY DONT TAKE IT - WE HAVE A PRECIDENT FOR COURT.

THEY WILL TAKE IT - TRUST ME - IN THE END THIS IS A MACHINE - THE MACHINE HAS TO ELIMINATE RISK - the option right now is INFITY BUST (unacceptable) or do everything illegal to safe your ass (of course they do this) - WE NEED TO CHANGE OUR POSITION TO:

WE WON THE BET - PAY UP and STOP EVERYTHING ELSE. IT WILL MAKE EVERYTHING GO AWAY and we will have MORE POWER AND UNLIMITED TENDIES!!!!!!!!!!!!",roy69al,4,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la7e12/these_tactics_are_as_see_through_as_my_hands/glmyft7/,0.112,0.744,0.144,0.9924

Alright everybody - as a monkey I will try to make this short and strategic. Get my VISION!

This is OUR current trajectory: the army keep buying and holding - Wallstreet is not only fixing the counterfeit stocks but at the same time CLOSING the short positions slowly. They keep prices from going to high thus keeping their losses to a minimum. In a week or so this will be fixed. Prices will decline and most of us will be holding STOCKS WE LOVE.

Then - class action against RH, Citadel, the clearinghouses heck we will probably try and sue the SEC for blatant disregard of the law. And to WIN these need to be organized and well orchestrated steps in order to even get traction. But we ARE DECENTALIZED and INDEPENDENT RETAIL MONKEYS.

Spoiler alert: These cases will drag out for years - everyone holding stock at XYZ date will be able to participate and there might be a settlement. Guess what wont happen - nobody is going to jail. They will have covered their trails, paid lawmakers and judges just to keep doing business as usual being more careful not to get caught by the public with their pants down AGAIN.

1411,AI," Ok something retards need to understand. When you trade with robinhood and many other broker apps and accounts you do not get access to the order book (without level II). But people with a bit more experience have full access to the order book and are running AI and machine learning on the orderbook to make big picture decisions and strategies.

This gives hedge funds and pros a HUGE advantage. Equivalent to playing poker where your opponent can see what cards you have (your orders, complete and open) and what cards you will receive (completed trade prices before you and what limit orders will be triggered when the price is posted). They can see your cards so knowing your bluff is a given.

How can they see your cards? They can see the orderbook. The orderbook tells them when you bought and at what point you will sell and buy at. They get a big picture when they can analyze all trades from all market participants. With Robinhood it's worse. Market makers get the orderbook from Robinhood and they never even need to post the trades to the exchange. Citadel makes the trade without even needing to post it to the exchange. At least not in the way that you might think.

With Hedge funds they have access to a HUGE amount of market moving capital. They can push the market around to prices where they see a trigger event will take place to their advantage. Let's say there are a million shares worth of limit sells sitting at 201 dollars. People create orders that tell hedge funds they will sell if the price drops to 201. This is good risk management but counter intuitive in situation like GME. People with stop loss are basically going against their own original plan. Hedgies can step down the price by selling to themselves or even open a temporary naked or real short with say 250k of shares to push the price down to 201 and trigger the sale of 1 million shares. Which they buy, close their temp short and long term short and repeat at an even lower trigger price.

Stick to your plan. You bought GME with the intent in taking part in a collectively triggered short squeeze. The squeeze is ongoing but the real pop has not happened. Hedge funds are unwinding using the above strategy. Hide your cards, remove your stop loss, limit sells orders. Any limit sells should be extremely high. This fucks with their machine learning and trading algos. Never market sell. You are literally letting the hedge fund print whatever price they want. Which will be as low as possible given the orderbook. They will HOLD batch market sells if it helps hit the trigger event they are working for. You post your market sell when price is 300 and you find your sale happens at 250. They can do this. Do not market sell. Do not panic sell. It doesn't work the way you think.

This is for entertainment purposes only. I am not a financial professional. I have lost more money trading then I have made. I am retarded.

Diamond hand this bitch. Could go to zero. Could fucking moon if everyone gets educated and sticks to their plan.

1435,CEO," If you think about it on Thursday morning options market makers broke. Literally they went insolvent because the short interest was so high they were on unlimited risk and they couldn't delta hedge because there were no shares available. 

So they were able to shut down the buy side of the trade through a coordinated effort of some solvent firms collaborating to protect insolvent counterparties to damage the buy-side side. Watch the interview from the CEO of IB, he literally confesses. 

After Thursday the options market makers or clearinghouses or whatever the fuck they are, we're able to reprice the options in a way that they wouldn't go broke.

I tried my best to relieve my  people, I made calls to regional mgmt, to corporate, to anyone who would  pick up and was never heard. I personally bought anyone who got shitty  shift lunch and/or dinner. Held in store contest just to perk their  beaten weary souls up some. GME intentionally keeps employees on part  time to avoid all the ""benefits"" that come with full time in America.  This comment right here though...

Don't  need to hear it was ""an honor"". Pay your people, stop over working  them, stop fucking nickle and diming customers, restructure stores to  actually provide a service and not be a knick knack shop, and maybe give  those employees bonuses. I don't mean some paltry bonus (expletive  deleted) clown. Hell maybe even give them STOCK in the company... While  you are ""eating popcorn"" and cheering on a movement, you and your  privileged family, have nothing to do with. Your employees are fucking  over worked, exasperated and starving.

This  comment pisses me off, only slightly less than a small group of people  bankrupting MILLIONS of people ""way back when"" 12 years ago.... I didn't  back you, you fucking degenerate, I backed the ideal, I backed the  employees I know by name. I backed the human souls in the brick and  mortar who give us the same ""Would you like to pre..."". I individually  backed the common person, and an icon of a dying legacy, to show I will  be heard. I backed humility and humanity over greed and oligarchy. It is  obvious you have absolutely no grasp on what is actually going on. And  your audacity has irked me and raised my ire.

I also would like to see theaters convert some of their massive megaplexes to include ""Micro-cinemas"" that you could rent by the hour. Imagine having like a 200 inch screen to play video games on, watch a big sporting event or even just program your own film festival with some friends. 

Beyond that - Why doesn't AMC start making or buying rights to films? They could easily recoup cost on that by collecting the entire ticket price - hell they could even make the film free to watch and the snack bar sales would probably recoup cost.",BenSemisch,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9ta9n/gamestop_founder_gary_kusin_said_it_was_an_honor/glkq06p/,0.059,0.794,0.147,0.9792

Google the word ""silver"" and look at the news. They are using the media to try and manipulate the price of silver to go up which hedge funds apparently own large portions of in a desperate attempt to trick non-redditors into buying silver. They are saying we all are going in on silver and that it is ""surging"" even though it only just went up 3 dollars since last week. Any profits they make from manipulating the price silver, they will use to try and cover their GME shorts. Please pass this info along!

We all know the math. It has been covered and covered to death.

I hope someone smarter than me will write a memo to Janet Yellen and the rest of whoever would be relevant to this discussion.

If The short players are allowed to get away with their blatant market manipulation and obviously unfair advantages, it will prove beyond any doubt that the market is a sham, that our financial system, our government and our country have all been bought. There will no longer be any room for doubt. 

Let the greedy bastards fail. Show us that you care about the people, or the people may decide they're not going to take it anymore. 

You want a revolution? 'Cause that's how you get a revolution. 

This is class warfare. This is a chance to prove that the system works as intended -- that even when big players take stupid risks and use their blatantly unfair advantages to tilt the paying field, the system has to work for everyone, no matter how small, or it works for no one. 

We're already hurting out here. The MAJORITY of kids where my own kids go to school are on the free lunch program because their families don't make enough money to buy food. And it's not just one school. Most of the schools in this city have the same problem. They even gave out free lunches during the pandemic so kids wouldn't have to go hungry.

Is that the USA we thought we lived in?

2008 was a debacle. It was an opportunity to do the right thing, and you failed. Letting one or two crooked hedge funds fail -- as they should -- wont solve the problem. But it's a start. And it will send a message. From now on, its time to play fair or get bitch-slapped.

When Bed bath & beyond, silver, and whatever else fail to become the next GME, they can say that it was a fluke & create a narrative undermining WSB/Reddit ppls, to discourage noobs & outsiders from getting in on the hype, hoping not only stop the GME squeeze, but also halt any further influence for that matter, as they try to ensure this moment can never be replicated. 

They want to win with GME, but also destroy any possibility for it to ever happen again. They're utterly devious.",-mooncake-,37,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la1cxi/sec_intern_pls_read_false_media_reports_about/glm08py/,0.108,0.789,0.103,-0.4964

And even if you think $300 a share is a lot, think about it like this. It could turn into $700 profit easily tomorrow if you invested at that rate. Hold that shit. It’s not too late.

With Basic account, they can lend out your GME stock to Melvin & Fuckers co. so then could short again & fuck U (us & GME) up.

Unfortunately you cannot switch the type of account you got with them!

Please check your account type see what you got. I am sure other cheap brokers with cheap &/or free trade app acounts do the same. Not sure whats the solution except HOLD. But to newbie retards opening their accounts, plz choose NOT the basic account! Hope this helps!

1869,AMC," Fidelity has saved me twice now. 

Many years ago, back when I worked warehouse and coffee shop jobs to get by as a poor student, I got caught in overdraft fee avalanches (this was before the government clamped down and made it an opt-in feature). I of course had no way to cover all the fees so my accounts were closed with balances outstanding. Thanks to Chexsystems (kinda like a credit report for checking accounts) I was locked out of practically every bank. I did the whole cash your checks at Walmart deal for a while, but felt so anxious carrying around all that cash all the time (it never broke $400, but man that was *all the money I had in the world* sitting in my pocket or apartment in less than great areas). 

Then I found Fidelity's cash management amount. It looked, behaved, and smelled like a checking account but it was basically a brokerage account with a card. Direct deposit, debit card, all ATM fees reimbursed...I dunno man it feels so cheesy but something as simple as paying with a card instead of digging through a wad of loose cash just lets you stand a little taller, you know? And I noticed that handing someone a Fidelity Investments card also made them a touch more...hospitable towards me I guess. Really opened my eyes to all of these signals that people use to judge others, because my income and lot in life was otherwise exactly the same but I was treated noticably better.

Fast forward many years. I've finished a couple degrees. Pulling in good money now. All the old debts were settled so I moved over to a credit union because **FUCK** the major banks. I started playing around in Robinhood before le squeeze only to find their fuckery when I tried ape my way in.

Then I remembered...I never actually closed the old Fidelity account.

THE WAR IS NOT WON HOWEVER.

AMC - it is a company that has been around since 1920, survive the Great Depression, WW2 & The 08 recession .. with the vaccines rolling out in the hundreds of millions, our economy is going to start to re open and people are going to want to go to the movies (cabin fever anyone?). Why would people want to go to the movies you ask? (Movie theaters have always done well during recessions if you are concerned about the future, AMC  should be valued around 30$ or more due to inflation; yet the stock is only about 1/3 of that at the moment). 

I bought some AMC at 18; if I can buy in and hold at 18 then you can buy in when it’s low and watch the gains come in and flow like water! (Thank me later). 

We are going to take AMC, GME, BB, and NOK to the moon! Don’t panic, never sell low! I know you’ve heard this a million times.. HOLD!!

(Buy low, sell high) ... well we aren’t selling though just yet, we are holding tell these hedge funds fold and we get the funds we DESERVE. Law suites and congress hearings are INCoMinG.

Well, millions of people have been waiting for some the movies that are coming out this year for DECADE(s), 
-Top Gun 
-Avatar 2 (made billions and set records)
-Dune Reboot 
- Matrix 4 
- Cinderella 
- 101 Dalmatians 
- Spawn Reboot 
- Venom 2 
(This is just a few of them) (100s of millions have gone into these movies and guess what they make money, ALOT of it) .. especially the opening week/month in theaters!

Today we have gotten so much publicity (the publicity we got today showed us the hedge fund managers put all their cards on the table, risking jail time for blatant stock manipulation). These hedge fund companies got swallowed alive on Twitter today). They even lost more money on GME despite all of their efforts to destroy it today! 

If ANYONE knows the power of social media it’s Reddit. WSB has gone up millions of new users;  many new retail investors are coming in to join the war and get on the 🚀 to the 🌝 !! 

GME, AMC, BB, NOK  (the war just started) and this is far from over; so, tonight is the night where we get ready for the battle tomorrow for our precious Diamonds! Get a little rest and eat some food if you can!! Be mentally vigilant tomorrow! don’t get paper hands if you see some high dips; this is the time to buy more and fuck the hedge funds; their strategies as you already know are FUCKED (they have some secret tricks up their sleeves, but so do we)... buy those dips and fuck them where it hurts! 

In all sales jobs we would have a rally with the team before the day to get everyone hyped up! Let’s get hyped up this morning guys! Together! Everyone do your part on social media and the comments, if millions of us do we we are just giving ourselves more publicity! We *HOLD* and buy on the dips! 

It was so nice seeing Congress, Celebs and lots of other high profile people being on the retail investors side! 

PS - Psych 101 - you never tell someone they can’t do something ie. “You can’t buy but you can sell” (reverse psychology is real) however, this was the only hand the hedge funds could play to keep from loosing everything today.. telling people not to buy is just going to make them want to buy more, and more.

AMC - it is a company that has been around since 1920, survive the Great Depression, WW2 & The 08 recession .. with the vaccines rolling out in the hundreds of millions, our economy is going to start to re open and people are going to want to go to the movies (cabin fever anyone?). Why would people want to go to the movies you ask? (Movie theaters have always done well during recessions if you are concerned about the future, AMC  should be valued around 30$ or more due to inflation; yet the stock is only about 1/3 of that at the moment). 

I bought some AMC at 18; if I can buy in and hold at 18 then you can buy in when it’s low and watch the gains come in and flow like water! (Thank me later). 

We are going to take AMC, GME, BB, and NOK to the moon! Don’t panic, never sell low! I know you’ve heard this a million times.. HOLD!!

(Buy low, sell high) ... well we aren’t selling though just yet, we are holding tell these hedge funds fold and we get the funds we DESERVE. Law suites and congress hearings are INCoMinG.

- 101 Dalmatians 
- Spawn Reboot 
- Venom 2 
(This is just a few of them) (100s of millions have gone into these movies and guess what they make money, ALOT of it) .. especially the opening week/month in theaters!

Today we have gotten so much publicity (the publicity we got today showed us the hedge fund managers put all their cards on the table, risking jail time for blatant stock manipulation). These hedge fund companies got swallowed alive on Twitter today). They even lost more money on GME despite all of their efforts to destroy it today!

In all sales jobs we would have a rally with the team before the day to get everyone hyped up! Let’s get hyped up this morning guys! Together!

I can recommend The Motley Fool podcasts as a good starting point for value investing, investopedia for general definitions, and then when you get a little more into it, professor Aswath Damodaran on YouTube, he's an expert in estimating company valuations.

2. what can you do? This is not financial advice!!!? 💎🙌 your GME to the grave. You got GME? put your phone down. Play some fucking COD, Watch a new Netflix series, do whatever it is you like to do.

THIS COULD BE OUR ONLY CHANCE TO SECURE A BETTER FUTURE FOR OURSELVES AND FUTURE GENERATIONS.

**This is what the shorts are doing right now.**

**Dont feel like reading a novel? The short and dirty (TLDR AT THE FUCKING BOTTOM):**

 
Short Attack:

1. Sell **fake**, COUNTERFEIT stocks between hedge funds and increasingly lower ask prices to try to scare other investors into selling and/or to trigger limit sell price points. They've been doing this all week. Each major price drop has been because of this tactic.


2. Get the media to spread fear, doubt, and uncertainty. Anyone watching CNBC this week has seen this in action.


3. Spread disinformation through ""analysis"" to get people to sell their stocks because ""the fundamentals aren't there"". Again, this is all over the place right now.


4. Open class action lawsuits against the company/shareholders claiming they're artificially inflating the stock price. Haven't seen it yet, but they've definitely threatened it.


5. Get the government/SEC involved alleging the same as #4. Definitely happening.


6. Pull margin shares and sell them. As seen being done by Robinhood over the last two days.


7. Spread FUD on message boards. Hello 4 million new subs pushing AMC, BB, SLV, etc.

Basically this past week has been 9/10 of the tactics in the short attack playbook to try to either push Gamestop into bankruptcy so they can profit on their short positions or slowly gain them back when people sell their stocks.

Confused what **counterfeited stock** means? Some light reading that /u/draemon_   provided explains it perfectly but beware, you actually have to read something:

* Jim Cramer, in a video-taped interview with The Street.com, best described the media function:

When (shorting) ... The hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful, because the truth is so against your view, (so the hedge funds) create a new 'truth' that is development of the fiction... you hit the brokerage houses with a series of orders (a short down ladder that pushes the price down), then we go to the press. You have a vicious cycle down - it's a pretty good game.*

**Yet more support for the at times illegal and unethical nature of these practices: (THANK YOU, /u/catolicquotes**

**Pulling Margin** from long customers during a short attack serves two purposes. Obviously the flood of shares that are “forced” sales help drive the price down, which aids the short cause in general. More important, for the broker dealers who clear for their retail customers at the same time they short against them, it creates a built-in source of cheap shares from which they can cover their open short positions.

Some of the **broker dealers short against their retail customers** from their proprietary trading desks, or “prop” desks. These are trades owned by the broker dealer, and, while they are not illegal, ethical questions certainly exist. The retail customers, who may be purchasing long investments that are being pushed by the broker dealer's retail network, have no inkling that the broker is taking a large short position contrary to the retail investor's position. With the encouragement of easy margin credit, i.e. 30% equity, the retail customers load up on stock and margin debt.

**The broker dealer, in concert with other shorts, may crash the stock by flooding the board with counterfeit shares, dropping the stock price**. The broker dealers know the amount of margin debt and the price at which their retail customers get into margin trouble. They can accelerate the squeeze on their retail customers by arbitrarily increasing the equity (percentage) requirement as the price is dropping, **frequently citing “volatility”**; which is really the shorts flooding the board with counterfeit shares.

The compounding effect of a dropping price and increasing equity requirement flushes out more shares. The broker dealers sometimes will take over the account during a margin sell-off. By engaging in poor trading practices, such as heavy selling over lunch hour; concentrated “dumps” of shares; hitting the bid with market orders; and conspiring with other trading desks, **they can further plummet the value of the stock and maximize the shares they have stripped from their retail customers**.

Most of the broker dealers who have both retail customers and prop-desk trading appear to engage in these practices. Goldman, Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch have been named in suits alleging these practices. Goldman made billions shorting against the subprime mortgage industry at the same time they were selling subprime investments to their customers.

When (shorting) ... The hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful, because the truth is so against your view, (so the hedge funds) create a new 'truth' that is development of the fiction... you hit the brokerage houses with a series of orders (a short down ladder that pushes the price down), then we go to the press. You have a vicious cycle down - it's a pretty good game.*

**Yet more support for the at times illegal and unethical nature of these practices: (THANK YOU, /u/catolicquotes**

**Pulling Margin** from long customers during a short attack serves two purposes. Obviously the flood of shares that are “forced” sales help drive the price down, which aids the short cause in general. More important, for the broker dealers who clear for their retail customers at the same time they short against them, it creates a built-in source of cheap shares from which they can cover their open short positions.

Some of the **broker dealers short against their retail customers** from their proprietary trading desks, or “prop” desks. These are trades owned by the broker dealer, and, while they are not illegal, ethical questions certainly exist. The retail customers, who may be purchasing long investments that are being pushed by the broker dealer's retail network, have no inkling that the broker is taking a large short position contrary to the retail investor's position. With the encouragement of easy margin credit, i.e. 30% equity, the retail customers load up on stock and margin debt.

**The broker dealer, in concert with other shorts, may crash the stock by flooding the board with counterfeit shares, dropping the stock price**. The broker dealers know the amount of margin debt and the price at which their retail customers get into margin trouble. They can accelerate the squeeze on their retail customers by arbitrarily increasing the equity (percentage) requirement as the price is dropping, **frequently citing “volatility”**; which is really the shorts flooding the board with counterfeit shares.

The compounding effect of a dropping price and increasing equity requirement flushes out more shares. The broker dealers sometimes will take over the account during a margin sell-off. By engaging in poor trading practices, such as heavy selling over lunch hour; concentrated “dumps” of shares; hitting the bid with market orders; and conspiring with other trading desks, **they can further plummet the value of the stock and maximize the shares they have stripped from their retail customers**.

Most of the broker dealers who have both retail customers and prop-desk trading appear to engage in these practices. Goldman, Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch have been named in suits alleging these practices. Goldman made billions shorting against the subprime mortgage industry at the same time they were selling subprime investments to their customers.

Check out real time transactions here: https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/latest-real-time-trades

See all the ""perfect"" orders (e.g. 100, 200, 300 shares) of nice whole numbers in the hundreds, with scattered ""imperfect orders""  (e.g. 134, 194 shares)? Notice how the nice, whole numbered orders are very predictable in pricing which varies cents off of one another? 

It's a coordinated attack. Hold and chill. This isn't financial advice, just sharing something new.

**This is what the shorts are doing right now.**

**Dont feel like reading a novel? The short and dirty (TLDR AT THE FUCKING BOTTOM):**

 
Short Attack:

1. Sell **fake**, COUNTERFEIT stocks between hedge funds and increasingly lower ask prices to try to scare other investors into selling and/or to trigger limit sell price points. They've been doing this all week. Each major price drop has been because of this tactic.


2. Get the media to spread fear, doubt, and uncertainty. Anyone watching CNBC this week has seen this in action.


3. Spread disinformation through ""analysis"" to get people to sell their stocks because ""the fundamentals aren't there"". Again, this is all over the place right now.


4. Open class action lawsuits against the company/shareholders claiming they're artificially inflating the stock price. Haven't seen it yet, but they've definitely threatened it.


5. Get the government/SEC involved alleging the same as #4. Definitely happening.


6. Pull margin shares and sell them. As seen being done by Robinhood over the last two days.


7. Spread FUD on message boards. Hello 4 million new subs pushing AMC, BB, SLV, etc.

Basically this past week has been 9/10 of the tactics in the short attack playbook to try to either push Gamestop into bankruptcy so they can profit on their short positions or slowly gain them back when people sell their stocks.

Confused what **counterfeited stock** means? Some light reading that /u/draemon_   provided explains it perfectly but beware, you actually have to read something:

[What does counterfeit stock mean?](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html)

2303,EDIT," >positive CMF

Chaikin Money Flow(CMF) measures buying and selling pressure for a given period of time. A move into positive territory indicates buying pressure, while a move into negative territory indicates selling pressure. You can use the absolute value of Chaikin Money Flow to confirm or question the price action of the underlying. Positive CMF would confirm an uptrend, but negative CMF would call into question the strength behind an uptrend. The reverse holds true for downtrends.

Positive CMF w/ uptrend in stock is normal

Negative CMF with downtrend is normal

Negative CMF with uptrend is fishy

Positive CMF with downtrend is fishy

EDIT Hey retards stop giving awards for easily searchable information and buy $GME instead

2371,AMC," I've tried creating a thread to post this long message several times today. It has been denied every time. I realize in this thread not many will see it but the mods won't let me create a thread.

I've been buying AMC off and on for awhile now. I think my average share price is around $14.25 a share. I have 2 separate accounts and have bought it at a bunch of different levels for a couple years. I have a total of 4872 shares. I tried  creating a thread but it is denied every time. I don't see an option to add photos when commenting in a thread. On Wednesday I got calls from a bunch of people telling me I should sell the stock when it was $15-$20. For better or worse I did not sell. I'm willing to hold whether AMC goes to $100+ or it goes to $0.

I've thought it was a good business for years and I love the movie theatre. I've had so many great times in the theatres over the last 25+ years. I probably go around 35 times a year now. Nothing can beat a great theatre experience! I have paid to see movies in theatres I can watch at home in 4K on a big tv for free. I know there are pitfalls mostly because of cell phones. Thankfully most theatres have spent endless money on upgrades to seating. The good theatres near me you only have to worry about seeing someone's phone if they are in your row with how the new seating is set up. So I've had pretty good luck at being able to still go to the theatre and be able to enjoy watching the movies.

For those that don't follow it closely, 2019 was the highest grossing year worldwide in the history of the box office. AMC also had higher concession growth than any of the other major theatre chains. Before the pandemic hit AMC Stubs had around 1 million members paying $20-$24 per month. Yet the stock was virtually at its all time low of around $7 a share. In 2016 it was around $33 per share. Even in the middle of 2019 the price was $16 a share. The only reason it got down to $7 around 6 months after that was because of the piece of shit short sellers. There is no way the company stock price should of ever been $7 a share in December of 2019/January 2020.

I realize it got down to $2 a share because of the pandemic. Yet basically every other company skyrocketed after hitting all time lows in March. Casino stocks, while closed and not pulling in a single dollar, went up 4-10x on their stock prices. Why has nothing happened for AMC until now? It's because of the short selling pieces of shit.

I'm holding and you should too. I think the chances for AMC are basically 50/50. If WSB members continue to buy and hold AMC could go to $100 or way more. Maybe even a few hundred a share. If everyone panics and sells it will probably go back down to $2 because of the shorts. If there was no revolution happening with WSB and no ridiculous shorting of AMC I still think it should be over $20 a share. AMC has avoided bankruptcy. Once everything starts returning to normal in 3-6 months all the new movies will be coming out in theatres. Everyone will be going to packed theatres again. The current slate from May of 2021 to the end of 2022 if nothing else gets pushed back will be the best 1 1/2 years the box office has ever seen.

GME and AMC are the only 2 stocks WSB members should be buying and holding if you care about making the shorts lose billions. These are the 2 stocks we can crush the shorts on. These are the 2 stocks that if everyone holds we cannot lose. I know most will say Im biased but even if I had no stake in it I would say out of all the stocks people are talking about to beat the shorts you should only be buying and holding GME and AMC. I think AMC has more potential because of how much lower the share price is. Plus how much GME has already gone up. For example I think a new WSB member or a new stock purchaser is more likely to buy and hold 20 some shares of AMC at $13-$15 a share than 1 share of GME at $300+. Either way if everyone sticks to the plan, GME and AMC stock holders should win!

When I was working I was taking home less than $40k a year. If I can hold close to 5000 shares of AMC at a high average price you can too!",dgoske84,262,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9sow3/amc_to_pluto/glk9m9d/,0.076,0.785,0.138,0.9959

2394,ALL," tldr: Hold your AMC until at least 200. Selling before then will just ruin it for you and everyone else. Today was a victory, but the war has just begun.

Today was an important step in the right direction, and a huge victory for us. AMC closed today at $13.26, much higher than the $9 dollars needed to close the call options in our favor. This means that there simply is not enough shares that the hedge funds can buy to cover their shares. WE WON THE BATTLE.

THE WAR IS NOT WON HOWEVER. The longer we hold our shares, the longer the hedge's will not be able to cover their shorts, and the more the fee's the hedge's will have to pay for not covering their shorts. Eventually, they will be begging us to sell them our shorts. IT IS UP TO USE TO HOLD OUR SHARES. WE MUST WORK TOGETHER. IF WE START UNDERCUTTING EACH OTHER, WE WILL ALL LOSE OUT.

HOLD YOUR AMC SHARES UNTIL AT LEAST $200 A SHARE. THE LONGER WE HOLD, THE HARDER THE GAMMA SQUEEZE. AT 200 WE WILL DECIDE IF WE HOLD AND PUSH FOR HIGHER NUMBERS OR IF WE SETTLE (MOST LIKELY WE WILL HOLD FOR MORE). Remember, the longer we hold, the more the hedge fund bastards will have to pay in fees. We will rinse them out.

HOLD YOUR AMC. DO NOT SELL. DO NOT FALL FOR THE HEDGE'S SCARE TACTICS. THEY WILL SHORT LADDER, PASS FAKE NEWS, WHATEVER THEY CAN TO SCARE YOU INTO SELLING. WE WILL HOLD OUT. DIAMOND HANDS. SET YOUR SELL LIMITS TO 200. WE WILL SHOW JUST HOW STRONG WE ARE TOGETHER.

Today was an important step in the right direction, and a huge victory for us. AMC closed today at $13.26, much higher than the $9 dollars needed to close the call options in our favor. This means that there simply is not enough shares that the hedge funds can buy to cover their shares. WE WON THE BATTLE.

THE WAR IS NOT WON HOWEVER. The longer we hold our shares, the longer the hedge's will not be able to cover their shorts, and the more the fee's the hedge's will have to pay for not covering their shorts. Eventually, they will be begging us to sell them our shorts. IT IS UP TO USE TO HOLD OUR SHARES. WE MUST WORK TOGETHER. IF WE START UNDERCUTTING EACH OTHER, WE WILL ALL LOSE OUT.

2401,ALOT," I want AMC to rise as much as everyone else (if not more) but I refuse to worship false idols even if it’s a joke .... may we all get together and be one!!  - 

I wrote this Piece on AMC a few days ago and I hope everyone reads its now !! 

I wrote this a couple days ago but feel like people should still read this if they haven’t and are in on AMC - everyone needs to do their part on social media!!!!! 

AMC - it is a company that has been around since 1920, survive the Great Depression, WW2 & The 08 recession .. with the vaccines rolling out in the hundreds of millions, our economy is going to start to re open and people are going to want to go to the movies (cabin fever anyone?). Why would people want to go to the movies you ask? (Movie theaters have always done well during recessions if you are concerned about the future, AMC  should be valued around 30$ or more due to inflation; yet the stock is only about 1/3 of that at the moment). 

I bought some AMC at 18; if I can buy in and hold at 18 then you can buy in when it’s low and watch the gains come in and flow like water! (Thank me later). 

We are going to take AMC, GME, BB, and NOK to the moon! Don’t panic, never sell low! I know you’ve heard this a million times.. HOLD!!

(Buy low, sell high) ... well we aren’t selling though just yet, we are holding tell these hedge funds fold and we get the funds we DESERVE. Law suites and congress hearings are INCoMinG.

Well, millions of people have been waiting for some the movies that are coming out this year for DECADE(s), 
-Top Gun 
-Avatar 2 (made billions and set records)
-Dune Reboot 
- Matrix 4 
- Cinderella 
- 101 Dalmatians 
- Spawn Reboot 
- Venom 2 
(This is just a few of them) (100s of millions have gone into these movies and guess what they make money, ALOT of it) .. especially the opening week/month in theaters!

Today we have gotten so much publicity (the publicity we got today showed us the hedge fund managers put all their cards on the table, risking jail time for blatant stock manipulation). These hedge fund companies got swallowed alive on Twitter today). They even lost more money on GME despite all of their efforts to destroy it today! 

If ANYONE knows the power of social media it’s Reddit. WSB has gone up millions of new users;  many new retail investors are coming in to join the war and get on the 🚀 to the 🌝 !! 

GME, AMC, BB, NOK  (the war just started) and this is far from over; so, tonight is the night where we get ready for the battle tomorrow for our precious Diamonds! Get a little rest and eat some food if you can!! Be mentally vigilant tomorrow! don’t get paper hands if you see some high dips; this is the time to buy more and fuck the hedge funds; their strategies as you already know are FUCKED (they have some secret tricks up their sleeves, but so do we)... buy those dips and fuck them where it hurts! 

In all sales jobs we would have a rally with the team before the day to get everyone hyped up! Let’s get hyped up this morning guys! Together! Everyone do your part on social media and the comments, if millions of us do we we are just giving ourselves more publicity! We *HOLD* and buy on the dips! 

It was so nice seeing Congress, Celebs and lots of other high profile people being on the retail investors side! 

PS - Psych 101 - you never tell someone they can’t do something ie. “You can’t buy but you can sell” (reverse psychology is real) however, this was the only hand the hedge funds could play to keep from loosing everything today.. telling people not to buy is just going to make them want to buy more, and more. DONT BE AFRAID, we are in this war together. We may not win every battle, but we WILL win the war ! Too much publicity not to at this point.

(Movie theaters have always done well during recessions if you are concerned about the future, AMC  should be valued around 30$ or more due to inflation; yet the stock is only about 1/3 of that at the moment). 

I bought some AMC at 18; if I can buy in and hold at 18 then you can buy in when it’s low and watch the gains come in and flow like water! (Thank me later). 

We are going to take AMC, GME, BB, and NOK to the moon! Don’t panic, never sell low! I know you’ve heard this a million times.. HOLD!!

(Buy low, sell high) ... well we aren’t selling though just yet, we are holding tell these hedge funds fold and we get the funds we DESERVE. Law suites and congress hearings are INCoMinG.

Well, millions of people have been waiting for some the movies that are coming out this year for DECADE(s), 
-Top Gun 
-Avatar 2 (made billions and set records)
-Dune Reboot 
- Matrix 4 
- Cinderella 
- 101 Dalmatians 
- Spawn Reboot 
- Venom 2 
(This is just a few of them) (100s of millions have gone into these movies and guess what they make money, ALOT of it) .. especially the opening week/month in theaters!

Today we have gotten so much publicity (the publicity we got today showed us the hedge fund managers put all their cards on the table, risking jail time for blatant stock manipulation). These hedge fund companies got swallowed alive on Twitter today). They even lost more money on GME despite all of their efforts to destroy it today! 

If ANYONE knows the power of social media it’s Reddit. WSB has gone up millions of new users;  many new retail investors are coming in to join the war and get on the 🚀 to the 🌝 !! 

GME, AMC, BB, NOK  (the war just started) and this is far from over; so, tonight is the night where we get ready for the battle tomorrow for our precious Diamonds! Get a little rest and eat some food if you can!! Be mentally vigilant tomorrow! don’t get paper hands if you see some high dips; this is the time to buy more and fuck the hedge funds; their strategies as you already know are FUCKED (they have some secret tricks up their sleeves, but so do we)... buy those dips and fuck them where it hurts! 

In all sales jobs we would have a rally with the team before the day to get everyone hyped up! Let’s get hyped up this morning guys! Together! Everyone do your part on social media and the comments, if millions of us do we we are just giving ourselves more publicity! We *HOLD* and buy on the dips! 

It was so nice seeing Congress, Celebs and lots of other high profile people being on the retail investors side! 

PS - Psych 101 - you never tell someone they can’t do something ie. “You can’t buy but you can sell” (reverse psychology is real) however, this was the only hand the hedge funds could play to keep from loosing everything today.. telling people not to buy is just going to make them want to buy more, and more. DONT BE AFRAID, we are in this war together. We may not win every battle, but we WILL win the war ! Too much publicity not to at this point. See you guys on the moon.  💎  🙌",Usual-Championship88,28,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9sow3/amc_to_pluto/glk4mp9/,0.117,0.787,0.096,-0.9831

2417,OR," Call me special, but I think Robin Hood made an error in it's calculations of restrictions on shares. I was trying to think how they would code the restrictions and there may be a fully legal loophole that they could get in trouble for blocking. As options contracts are just that... legal contracts.

They will allow you to buy X number of call options depending in what company your looking to buy into.

The allow you to exercise your call option early AND in OR out of the money. Theoretically a close dated far ITM call would allow you to purchase 100 shares for within close proximity of current market value.

Continuing on, it is my understanding that the restrictions on options are the amount in your account at a given time, NOT a historical amount you have purchased. So as long as you keep exercising you should be able to keep purchasing stocks around the limit.

Just wanted to try and help anyone who is stuck on Robin Hood due to shares being tied up and wanting to have the power to pursue their own decisions.

Good Luck Autists and HOLD!

Market orders are orders the MARKET sets the price. 

Example time!

Successful not buy due to limit order:

I set limit order gme x1 stock @ $315. 
Market opens and the stock is $10,000,  my limit DOES NOT trigger and I DONT buy the stock.


Successful buy due to market order:

I set order gme x1 stock market order.
Market opens and the stock is $312, I buy that stock. 


Successful buy due to market order 2:

2539,OR," Call me special, but I think Robin Hood made an error in it's calculations of restrictions on shares. I was trying to think how they would code the restrictions and there may be a fully legal loophole that they could get in trouble for blocking. As options contracts are just that... legal contracts.

They will allow you to buy X number of call options depending in what company your looking to buy into.

The allow you to exercise your call option early AND in OR out of the money. Theoretically a close dated far ITM call would allow you to purchase 100 shares for within close proximity of current market value.

Continuing on, it is my understanding that the restrictions on options are the amount in your account at a given time, NOT a historical amount you have purchased. So as long as you keep exercising you should be able to keep purchasing stocks around the limit.

Just wanted to try and help anyone who is stuck on Robin Hood due to shares being tied up and wanting to have the power to pursue their own decisions.

Good Luck Autists and HOLD!

**This is what the shorts are doing right now.**

**Dont feel like reading a novel? The short and dirty (TLDR AT THE FUCKING BOTTOM):**

 
Short Attack:

1. Sell **fake**, COUNTERFEIT stocks between hedge funds and increasingly lower ask prices to try to scare other investors into selling and/or to trigger limit sell price points. They've been doing this all week. Each major price drop has been because of this tactic.


2. Get the media to spread fear, doubt, and uncertainty. Anyone watching CNBC this week has seen this in action.


3. Spread disinformation through ""analysis"" to get people to sell their stocks because ""the fundamentals aren't there"". Again, this is all over the place right now.


4. Open class action lawsuits against the company/shareholders claiming they're artificially inflating the stock price. Haven't seen it yet, but they've definitely threatened it.


5. Get the government/SEC involved alleging the same as #4. Definitely happening.


6. Pull margin shares and sell them. As seen being done by Robinhood over the last two days.


7. Spread FUD on message boards. Hello 4 million new subs pushing AMC, BB, SLV, etc.

Basically this past week has been 9/10 of the tactics in the short attack playbook to try to either push Gamestop into bankruptcy so they can profit on their short positions or slowly gain them back when people sell their stocks.

Confused what **counterfeited stock** means? Some light reading that /u/draemon_   provided explains it perfectly but beware, you actually have to read something:

* Jim Cramer, in a video-taped interview with The Street.com, best described the media function:

When (shorting) ... The hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful, because the truth is so against your view, (so the hedge funds) create a new 'truth' that is development of the fiction... you hit the brokerage houses with a series of orders (a short down ladder that pushes the price down), then we go to the press. You have a vicious cycle down - it's a pretty good game.*

**Yet more support for the at times illegal and unethical nature of these practices: (THANK YOU, /u/catolicquotes**

**Pulling Margin** from long customers during a short attack serves two purposes. Obviously the flood of shares that are “forced” sales help drive the price down, which aids the short cause in general. More important, for the broker dealers who clear for their retail customers at the same time they short against them, it creates a built-in source of cheap shares from which they can cover their open short positions.

Some of the **broker dealers short against their retail customers** from their proprietary trading desks, or “prop” desks. These are trades owned by the broker dealer, and, while they are not illegal, ethical questions certainly exist. The retail customers, who may be purchasing long investments that are being pushed by the broker dealer's retail network, have no inkling that the broker is taking a large short position contrary to the retail investor's position. With the encouragement of easy margin credit, i.e. 30% equity, the retail customers load up on stock and margin debt.

**The broker dealer, in concert with other shorts, may crash the stock by flooding the board with counterfeit shares, dropping the stock price**. The broker dealers know the amount of margin debt and the price at which their retail customers get into margin trouble. They can accelerate the squeeze on their retail customers by arbitrarily increasing the equity (percentage) requirement as the price is dropping, **frequently citing “volatility”**; which is really the shorts flooding the board with counterfeit shares.

The compounding effect of a dropping price and increasing equity requirement flushes out more shares. The broker dealers sometimes will take over the account during a margin sell-off. By engaging in poor trading practices, such as heavy selling over lunch hour; concentrated “dumps” of shares; hitting the bid with market orders; and conspiring with other trading desks, **they can further plummet the value of the stock and maximize the shares they have stripped from their retail customers**.

Most of the broker dealers who have both retail customers and prop-desk trading appear to engage in these practices. Goldman, Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch have been named in suits alleging these practices. Goldman made billions shorting against the subprime mortgage industry at the same time they were selling subprime investments to their customers.

**This is what the shorts are doing right now.**

**Dont feel like reading a novel? The short and dirty (TLDR AT THE FUCKING BOTTOM):**

 
Short Attack:

1. Sell **fake**, COUNTERFEIT stocks between hedge funds and increasingly lower ask prices to try to scare other investors into selling and/or to trigger limit sell price points. They've been doing this all week. Each major price drop has been because of this tactic.


2. Get the media to spread fear, doubt, and uncertainty. Anyone watching CNBC this week has seen this in action.


3. Spread disinformation through ""analysis"" to get people to sell their stocks because ""the fundamentals aren't there"". Again, this is all over the place right now.


4. Open class action lawsuits against the company/shareholders claiming they're artificially inflating the stock price. Haven't seen it yet, but they've definitely threatened it.


5. Get the government/SEC involved alleging the same as #4. Definitely happening.


6. Pull margin shares and sell them. As seen being done by Robinhood over the last two days.


7. Spread FUD on message boards. Hello 4 million new subs pushing AMC, BB, SLV, etc.

Basically this past week has been 9/10 of the tactics in the short attack playbook to try to either push Gamestop into bankruptcy so they can profit on their short positions or slowly gain them back when people sell their stocks.

Confused what **counterfeited stock** means? Some light reading that /u/draemon_   provided explains it perfectly but beware, you actually have to read something:

[What does counterfeit stock mean?](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html)

**Need more proof?**

Jim Cramer himself, 
[""here's what short sellers do, it's illegal but when you have 6 days to get out and you're down you need to foment and wipe that guy out quickly"".](https://youtu.be/VMuEis3byY4)

**This interview, which is more like a confession, was never supposed to get on the air; however, it somehow ended up on YouTube. Cramer and The Street.com have made repeated efforts, with some success, to get it taken off of YouTube. (THANKS for this info, /u/blancochocolate)**

* Jim Cramer, in a video-taped interview with The Street.com, best described the media function:

When (shorting) ... The hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful, because the truth is so against your view, (so the hedge funds) create a new 'truth' that is development of the fiction... you hit the brokerage houses with a series of orders (a short down ladder that pushes the price down), then we go to the press. You have a vicious cycle down - it's a pretty good game.*

Investopedia [""Short and Distort"" - illegal short tactic ](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/analyst/030102.asp#:~:text=Short%20and%20distort%20(S%26D)

**Yet more support for the at times illegal and unethical nature of these practices: (THANK YOU, /u/catolicquotes**

**Pulling Margin** from long customers during a short attack serves two purposes. Obviously the flood of shares that are “forced” sales help drive the price down, which aids the short cause in general. More important, for the broker dealers who clear for their retail customers at the same time they short against them, it creates a built-in source of cheap shares from which they can cover their open short positions.

Some of the **broker dealers short against their retail customers** from their proprietary trading desks, or “prop” desks. These are trades owned by the broker dealer, and, while they are not illegal, ethical questions certainly exist. The retail customers, who may be purchasing long investments that are being pushed by the broker dealer's retail network, have no inkling that the broker is taking a large short position contrary to the retail investor's position. With the encouragement of easy margin credit, i.e. 30% equity, the retail customers load up on stock and margin debt.

**The broker dealer, in concert with other shorts, may crash the stock by flooding the board with counterfeit shares, dropping the stock price**. The broker dealers know the amount of margin debt and the price at which their retail customers get into margin trouble. They can accelerate the squeeze on their retail customers by arbitrarily increasing the equity (percentage) requirement as the price is dropping, **frequently citing “volatility”**; which is really the shorts flooding the board with counterfeit shares.

The compounding effect of a dropping price and increasing equity requirement flushes out more shares. The broker dealers sometimes will take over the account during a margin sell-off. By engaging in poor trading practices, such as heavy selling over lunch hour; concentrated “dumps” of shares; hitting the bid with market orders; and conspiring with other trading desks, **they can further plummet the value of the stock and maximize the shares they have stripped from their retail customers**.

Most of the broker dealers who have both retail customers and prop-desk trading appear to engage in these practices. Goldman, Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch have been named in suits alleging these practices. Goldman made billions shorting against the subprime mortgage industry at the same time they were selling subprime investments to their customers.

2707,CAN," The Reason We can't just Buy Back In.

The Meme: Buy, Hold, Never sell.

Why do we have to Diamond Hand so hard right now? Can't we just buy dips to increase our holdings? 

NO. ABSOLUTELY NOT.

Because we control the stocks. THEY control the shorts. Sure, you CAN buy back at a dip, but this is 2 steps forward and countless steps back.

Imagine: a trader shorts his GME out expecting GameStop to go under. He gets his money, the stock is loaned, and he doesn't pay a cent. Now: imagine this second trader shorts this stock. This share is officially over-shorted. Repeat this 3, 4, 5, a gorillion times, it doesn't matter. At the end of the day, it's only one share taken hostage.

If you sell a single share, that entire line of overshorts vanishes as they just loan back the stock up the chain at a loss. We can't make them short after we buy back in.

THAT is why we can't just sell and buy back the dips. If we sell, the dips will become a permanent crash. WE control the stocks. THEY control the shorts.

If WE give them the power to eradicate their short chains, they win. If WE DON'T give them the power to eradicate their chains, they will end up insolvent and we win. Exponential gains down the road. Debt + (Debt*Interest) = OUR GAINS.

2708,GME," The Reason We can't just Buy Back In.

The Meme: Buy, Hold, Never sell.

Why do we have to Diamond Hand so hard right now? Can't we just buy dips to increase our holdings? 

NO. ABSOLUTELY NOT.

Because we control the stocks. THEY control the shorts. Sure, you CAN buy back at a dip, but this is 2 steps forward and countless steps back.

Imagine: a trader shorts his GME out expecting GameStop to go under. He gets his money, the stock is loaned, and he doesn't pay a cent. Now: imagine this second trader shorts this stock. This share is officially over-shorted. Repeat this 3, 4, 5, a gorillion times, it doesn't matter. At the end of the day, it's only one share taken hostage.

If you sell a single share, that entire line of overshorts vanishes as they just loan back the stock up the chain at a loss. We can't make them short after we buy back in.

THAT is why we can't just sell and buy back the dips. If we sell, the dips will become a permanent crash. WE control the stocks. THEY control the shorts.

If WE give them the power to eradicate their short chains, they win. If WE DON'T give them the power to eradicate their chains, they will end up insolvent and we win. Exponential gains down the road. Debt + (Debt*Interest) = OUR GAINS. 

THAT IS WHY YOU CAN'T SELL. IF YOU SELL, WE ALL LOSE. IF YOU HOLD, WE ALL WIN.

Not Financial Advice, of course. I just love the stock.

2731,AI," Everyone should also consider these relevant points and taking the relevant actions:

1. Big money is MORTIFIED and the retaliation is completely unprecedented: coordinated attacks, willingness to risk prison over financial loss, concealing data, etc. They're shaking because we're holding GME. Despite any other lack of information available, this may be the best signal for why you should hold. Period.

2. After the massive GME rise, there was a LOT of bot activity trying to distract, dissuade, misinform, etc. They're poisoning the well, and it's difficult to know what can be trusted and what can't, and there are likely attempts to hype up other stocks that don't realistically have anywhere close to the same potential. The one thing we DEFINITELY know, however, is that all of those attacks are being done because we are holding GME.

3. Robinhood + Citadel are trying to spin a BS narrative to cover up things going much deeper. If your institution can't afford something, shut everything down equally and go bankrupt. Choosing a specific stock to shut down is perhaps the most egregiously corrupt action ever taken in the market (which is saying A LOT). YOU weren't allowed to buy when major funds were, especially at CRITICAL times with CRITICAL buying opportunities to protect Citadel + big money and it collectively cost us tens (or hundreds?) of billions in lost opportunity. They're being sued, and rightfully so, but laws need to change to ruthlessly punish them NOW. Contact your representatives, SEC, etc. if you haven't already.

4. Hedges might lie about their short positions and the data is extremely difficult to access, which is why we're in this situation. They can break laws and face negligible fees by comparison to the rest of what they stand to lose. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume they might do this among many other PR stunts to terrify you. Keep updated. Some places (like iborrowdesk) are no longer reporting on updated gme because, again, the legal consequences don't matter enough and they're protecting their interests. Refer to #1.

5. We don't know WHEN short positions will be covered, only the math that requires them to cover as we move forward. So if they delay and everyone gives in, they could save a lot of money. However, the longer they delay, the more they have to pay. So it's a matter of whether or not they double down and face higher risk/reward or not. Be prepared to WAIT.

6. Setting your shares with limits means there are less shares to short, which increases the fees that those shorts have to pay. This helps with the squeeze. The selfless act is to avoid low limits (at least at first), but the ultimate goal is to distribute wealth to the people so take if you're the people who need it. Otherwise institutions holding might sell at higher rates than you do, which defeats the point.

7. If you're angry at Robinhood, move accounts to hurt their bottom line. However, during transfer you'll be unable to trade, so you have to decide if that's worth it to you in this moment. Some have suggested doing partial transfers. Consider moving to SoFi. Like all brokers, it's tied into the system, but Chamath is entering the game and is perhaps the one major CEO that's on our side here and probably offering the best option.

8. There's a lot of talk about Robinhood going insolvent. I can't tell if this is FUD or not, but the market value of GME even now is miniscule compared to everything else they cover. So I don't follow the logic how they're supposedly in financial trouble. If it DID go insolvent (not saying it will), people might only be compensated for up to 250k or 500k. The medium guys will get screwed if RH becomes a sacrifice to avoid much bigger losses. I don't know what to do with this information yet, but it should be on your radar.

9. Be prepared to join a class action lawsuit if you owned any GME, AMC, etc, but let some more information feed in first. We're uncovering more of this each day. A lot of focus has been Robinhood, but it goes deeper as well. Robinhood and other institutions' actions were blatant market manipulation. Document evidence of owning the stocks (it will be in your broker's history), or any intent of it such as on Reddit about your intent to buy stocks before they locked trading. If you owned a lot, consider joining as a Named Class Representative for financial returns specific to your case (rather than just what everyone gets). These are civil cases to redistribute wealth back to you, and could be significant. Only sign up in one class action suit or it could be considered fraud.

10. Be cautious about buying at times when institutions can anticipate it and control how they handle your buy orders, such as market open. It's a major gamble if you're not setting limits. Consider letting the stock dip before you buy because we can expect a lot of attempts to make that happen. It's better to us all if you get more stocks, but the institutions are notoriously hard to beat at this game. They are, generally speaking, much better at this, and they cheat to imbalance everything.

11. It's hard to anticipate what other stunts will be pulled to try to screw us over or how deep this goes. There's new information suggesting there might be a lot of counterfeit stocks, which has historical precedent with Fannie Mae. See [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the_real_reason_wall_street_is_terrified_of_the/) for the full report. Contact your representatives, particularly those in finance committees and demand investigations and REAL consequences for these criminal behaviors. This matters.

12. It's also worth investigating the other grossly unfair (some technically legal, some illegal but easily concealed) attack vectors they use against us: flow orders, hidden data, AI algorithms, etc. They always win because the game is rigged. Shorting should be illegal. Please remember that this is more than about making money, it's about a movement. Demand these things be changed.

2732,AMC," Everyone should also consider these relevant points and taking the relevant actions:

1. Big money is MORTIFIED and the retaliation is completely unprecedented: coordinated attacks, willingness to risk prison over financial loss, concealing data, etc. They're shaking because we're holding GME. Despite any other lack of information available, this may be the best signal for why you should hold. Period.

2. After the massive GME rise, there was a LOT of bot activity trying to distract, dissuade, misinform, etc. They're poisoning the well, and it's difficult to know what can be trusted and what can't, and there are likely attempts to hype up other stocks that don't realistically have anywhere close to the same potential. The one thing we DEFINITELY know, however, is that all of those attacks are being done because we are holding GME.

3. Robinhood + Citadel are trying to spin a BS narrative to cover up things going much deeper. If your institution can't afford something, shut everything down equally and go bankrupt. Choosing a specific stock to shut down is perhaps the most egregiously corrupt action ever taken in the market (which is saying A LOT). YOU weren't allowed to buy when major funds were, especially at CRITICAL times with CRITICAL buying opportunities to protect Citadel + big money and it collectively cost us tens (or hundreds?) of billions in lost opportunity. They're being sued, and rightfully so, but laws need to change to ruthlessly punish them NOW. Contact your representatives, SEC, etc. if you haven't already.

4. Hedges might lie about their short positions and the data is extremely difficult to access, which is why we're in this situation. They can break laws and face negligible fees by comparison to the rest of what they stand to lose. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume they might do this among many other PR stunts to terrify you. Keep updated. Some places (like iborrowdesk) are no longer reporting on updated gme because, again, the legal consequences don't matter enough and they're protecting their interests. Refer to #1.

5. We don't know WHEN short positions will be covered, only the math that requires them to cover as we move forward. So if they delay and everyone gives in, they could save a lot of money. However, the longer they delay, the more they have to pay. So it's a matter of whether or not they double down and face higher risk/reward or not. Be prepared to WAIT.

6. Setting your shares with limits means there are less shares to short, which increases the fees that those shorts have to pay. This helps with the squeeze. The selfless act is to avoid low limits (at least at first), but the ultimate goal is to distribute wealth to the people so take if you're the people who need it. Otherwise institutions holding might sell at higher rates than you do, which defeats the point.

7. If you're angry at Robinhood, move accounts to hurt their bottom line. However, during transfer you'll be unable to trade, so you have to decide if that's worth it to you in this moment. Some have suggested doing partial transfers. Consider moving to SoFi. Like all brokers, it's tied into the system, but Chamath is entering the game and is perhaps the one major CEO that's on our side here and probably offering the best option.

8. There's a lot of talk about Robinhood going insolvent. I can't tell if this is FUD or not, but the market value of GME even now is miniscule compared to everything else they cover. So I don't follow the logic how they're supposedly in financial trouble. If it DID go insolvent (not saying it will), people might only be compensated for up to 250k or 500k. The medium guys will get screwed if RH becomes a sacrifice to avoid much bigger losses. I don't know what to do with this information yet, but it should be on your radar.

9. Be prepared to join a class action lawsuit if you owned any GME, AMC, etc, but let some more information feed in first. We're uncovering more of this each day. A lot of focus has been Robinhood, but it goes deeper as well. Robinhood and other institutions' actions were blatant market manipulation. Document evidence of owning the stocks (it will be in your broker's history), or any intent of it such as on Reddit about your intent to buy stocks before they locked trading. If you owned a lot, consider joining as a Named Class Representative for financial returns specific to your case (rather than just what everyone gets). These are civil cases to redistribute wealth back to you, and could be significant. Only sign up in one class action suit or it could be considered fraud.

10. Be cautious about buying at times when institutions can anticipate it and control how they handle your buy orders, such as market open. It's a major gamble if you're not setting limits. Consider letting the stock dip before you buy because we can expect a lot of attempts to make that happen. It's better to us all if you get more stocks, but the institutions are notoriously hard to beat at this game. They are, generally speaking, much better at this, and they cheat to imbalance everything.

11. It's hard to anticipate what other stunts will be pulled to try to screw us over or how deep this goes. There's new information suggesting there might be a lot of counterfeit stocks, which has historical precedent with Fannie Mae. See [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the_real_reason_wall_street_is_terrified_of_the/) for the full report. Contact your representatives, particularly those in finance committees and demand investigations and REAL consequences for these criminal behaviors. This matters.

12. It's also worth investigating the other grossly unfair (some technically legal, some illegal but easily concealed) attack vectors they use against us: flow orders, hidden data, AI algorithms, etc. They always win because the game is rigged. Shorting should be illegal. Please remember that this is more than about making money, it's about a movement. Demand these things be changed.

8. There's a lot of talk about Robinhood going insolvent. I can't tell if this is FUD or not, but the market value of GME even now is miniscule compared to everything else they cover. So I don't follow the logic how they're supposedly in financial trouble. If it DID go insolvent (not saying it will), people might only be compensated for up to 250k or 500k. The medium guys will get screwed if RH becomes a sacrifice to avoid much bigger losses. I don't know what to do with this information yet, but it should be on your radar.

9. Be prepared to join a class action lawsuit if you owned any GME, AMC, etc, but let some more information feed in first. We're uncovering more of this each day. A lot of focus has been Robinhood, but it goes deeper as well. Robinhood and other institutions' actions were blatant market manipulation. Document evidence of owning the stocks (it will be in your broker's history), or any intent of it such as on Reddit about your intent to buy stocks before they locked trading. If you owned a lot, consider joining as a Named Class Representative for financial returns specific to your case (rather than just what everyone gets). These are civil cases to redistribute wealth back to you, and could be significant. Only sign up in one class action suit or it could be considered fraud.

10. Be cautious about buying at times when institutions can anticipate it and control how they handle your buy orders, such as market open. It's a major gamble if you're not setting limits. Consider letting the stock dip before you buy because we can expect a lot of attempts to make that happen. It's better to us all if you get more stocks, but the institutions are notoriously hard to beat at this game. They are, generally speaking, much better at this, and they cheat to imbalance everything.

11. It's hard to anticipate what other stunts will be pulled to try to screw us over or how deep this goes. There's new information suggesting there might be a lot of counterfeit stocks, which has historical precedent with Fannie Mae. See [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the_real_reason_wall_street_is_terrified_of_the/) for the full report. Contact your representatives, particularly those in finance committees and demand investigations and REAL consequences for these criminal behaviors. This matters.

12. It's also worth investigating the other grossly unfair (some technically legal, some illegal but easily concealed) attack vectors they use against us: flow orders, hidden data, AI algorithms, etc. They always win because the game is rigged. Shorting should be illegal. Please remember that this is more than about making money, it's about a movement. Demand these things be changed.

13. For everyone saying hold until zero, that is a potentially dangerous sentiment. Holding may very well expose a lot of corruption, but those in financial need should not be risking their life savings. The goal is to distribute wealth to the PEOPLE, which means some of you should have an exit strategy or the institutions just win 100% of it.

2737,REAL," Everyone should also consider these relevant points and taking the relevant actions:

1. Big money is MORTIFIED and the retaliation is completely unprecedented: coordinated attacks, willingness to risk prison over financial loss, concealing data, etc. They're shaking because we're holding GME. Despite any other lack of information available, this may be the best signal for why you should hold. Period.

2. After the massive GME rise, there was a LOT of bot activity trying to distract, dissuade, misinform, etc. They're poisoning the well, and it's difficult to know what can be trusted and what can't, and there are likely attempts to hype up other stocks that don't realistically have anywhere close to the same potential. The one thing we DEFINITELY know, however, is that all of those attacks are being done because we are holding GME.

3. Robinhood + Citadel are trying to spin a BS narrative to cover up things going much deeper. If your institution can't afford something, shut everything down equally and go bankrupt. Choosing a specific stock to shut down is perhaps the most egregiously corrupt action ever taken in the market (which is saying A LOT). YOU weren't allowed to buy when major funds were, especially at CRITICAL times with CRITICAL buying opportunities to protect Citadel + big money and it collectively cost us tens (or hundreds?) of billions in lost opportunity. They're being sued, and rightfully so, but laws need to change to ruthlessly punish them NOW. Contact your representatives, SEC, etc. if you haven't already.

4. Hedges might lie about their short positions and the data is extremely difficult to access, which is why we're in this situation. They can break laws and face negligible fees by comparison to the rest of what they stand to lose. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume they might do this among many other PR stunts to terrify you. Keep updated. Some places (like iborrowdesk) are no longer reporting on updated gme because, again, the legal consequences don't matter enough and they're protecting their interests. Refer to #1.

5. We don't know WHEN short positions will be covered, only the math that requires them to cover as we move forward. So if they delay and everyone gives in, they could save a lot of money. However, the longer they delay, the more they have to pay. So it's a matter of whether or not they double down and face higher risk/reward or not. Be prepared to WAIT.

6. Setting your shares with limits means there are less shares to short, which increases the fees that those shorts have to pay. This helps with the squeeze. The selfless act is to avoid low limits (at least at first), but the ultimate goal is to distribute wealth to the people so take if you're the people who need it. Otherwise institutions holding might sell at higher rates than you do, which defeats the point.

7. If you're angry at Robinhood, move accounts to hurt their bottom line. However, during transfer you'll be unable to trade, so you have to decide if that's worth it to you in this moment.

Now 3 4 and 5 all show up and they paid for 50 fucking bananas and you better believe harambe gonna get them. Doesnt matter that the bananas didnt exist, the banana dealer is insured. So the banana distributor now has to go ok ill pay you for the current price of bananas and destroy the IOUs (In reality this is gonna be waaaaay messier with lawsuits and all sorts of shit). Now the correct amount is in circulation again and every either has bananas to trade at market price or equivalent cash.

2755,AMC," Go through the GME-adjacent stocks like NOK, AMC, BB, etc.

AMC, BB, NOK (not GME) all look bad in terms of short positions vs. shares issues, but they look natural. Most look like the shorts are maybe half-ish of all the shares. 

Potential short squeezes? Sure, but they're not full-on suitcase nukes sitting in downtown Manhattan. Not a great look, but not remotely suggestive of a crime.

So this is something I don’t see talked about around here. EVERYONE gives in. There are theories that being as there are more shares in circulation than were issued, retail MIGHT own up to 100% of the shares. 
However, there are large hedge funds in the long position as well. 

The infinite GME short squeeze is often brought up, but why wasn’t VW infinite? I suppose because hedge funds sold. Maybe because they’re in business to make money, not send a message.

Basically, a corrupt hedge fund/entity will perform the shorting through a broker generating a bunch of IOUs for shares on the broker's side, these are the evidence of the counterfeit shares. 

After the stock price tanks, the ""profits"" are withdrawn and transferred out through an offshore organization.  This leaves the broker with a theoretically equal balance- the liabilities of the IOUs vs some small cash balance. 

If the company goes bankrupt,  these liabilities eventually disappear and noone is the wiser.

Dear SEC and President Biden,

I am calling on you today, pursuant to 15 U.S.C.A. § 78i, titled Manipulation of Security Prices, to prohibit manipulative and deceptive tactics that artificially depresses the price of GME and AMC securities in contravention of the laws of the United States. 

Section 78i(a) clearly states that ""It shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, by the use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce, or  of any facility of any national securities exchange, or for any member  of a national securities exchange -- **(2)**  To effect, alone or with 1 or more other persons, *a series of transactions* in any security registered on a national securities  exchange, any security not so registered, or *in connection with any security-based swap or security-based swap agreement* with respect to such security creating actual or apparent active trading in such  security, or **raising or depressing the price of such security, for the purpose of inducing the purchase or sale of such security by others.""**

Currently, GME and AMC stock prices are actively being manipulated using a mechanism called ""short ladder attacks"" to depress the price of these stocks in contravention of 15 U.S.C.A. § 78i. ""Short ladder attacks"" occur when large institutions in possession of the aforementioned stocks sell them for just less than market value in rapid succession between one another in order to drive the price down. The fact that short ladder attacks exist is apparent from on-going market activity that can be seen here  [https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/latest-real-time-trades](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/latest-real-time-trades) and  [https://imgur.com/gallery/Y9TVxCj](https://imgur.com/gallery/Y9TVxCj) Such blatant attacks readily establishes prima facie case of market manipulation and must be investigated by the SEC immediately. Further silence from the SEC on this matter, which can be investigated quite quickly, not only encourages further market manipulation but also further diminishes public trust and faith in the U.S. Government.

Finally, section 78i(f) makes it clear that ""Any person who willfully participates in any act or transaction in  violation of subsections (a), (b), or (c) of this section, **shall** be liable to any person who shall purchase or sell any security at a price  which was affected by such act or transaction.""  


I am calling on you to do your job. The direct manipulation of GME and AMC stock prices is on-going and hurts the public interest. You must act now before it is too late.

Sincerely,

2798,GME," 1. Average down means reduce the average cost of your shares. You can't time the bottom. You see a dip you buy the dip. Say you buy 4 shares at 300, right before a dip. Your in 4@300. Then, you buy the dip, say another 4@200. Now you're in 8@250. Rinse and repeat, and reducing the average cost.

2. Ladder attacks. They're systematically unloading shares at regular intervals to try and drive the price down.

3. They're trying to trick us monkeys into loosening our collective grip on GME by leveraging our susceptibility to social media influence and our short attention span. Buying silver helps them twice since they own most of the silver stock - when we unload GME to buy silver we drive GME down and Silver up, giving them more money to leverage.

5. Can't say exactly. Some people think 1k, some people think 5k, some people think 69,420.

6. Everyone except the media is looking at DFV's calendar. Media can't read reports so they are saying the squeeze is squoze, but it ain't so.

But here goes:
1. It was in the 80s a week ago, and they were not covering their shorts. It’s possible they’ve repositioned them since then BUT it hit 129 last week Friday and did NOT get covered (if it had, prices would have spiked, and fast). So presumably anything above $60 is a low which still leaves us a squeeze.

2. This is where I’m mostly an ape on drugs and not sure, but all we know for a fact is actually covering their shorts would spike it higher than it’s gone, because we have access to the short listings and such, and the closing prices have been high.
3. Yes. So many. Also, Reddit could not spike silver. Just...just no. That’d be like Melvin deciding to short Apple. Yeah, it might go down for a sec, but Apple is solid and no one thinks it’s going under. 
4. Internet for photos, and others have posted stuff, but it’s look reeeeally similar. The dip before the squeeze went super low — GME equivalent dip would be ~100.
5. Depends when the squeeze happens. Our best case scenario is that the market closes one day at 450 or something insane and so they then can’t possible front enough capital to maintain their shorts and they cover at 450 a share. Probably would send GME to 10-20k.
6. Have your own strategy. DFV didn’t put his life savings into GME, and tbh he could hold through the squeeze if his plan was ultra long GME. 
7. There is so much crap being done to discourage GME share holders. Like think about it. With what other share have you EVER seen the media encourage a sell so hard? You haven’t.

2848,GME," Correct. Stock price doesn't really affect company operations. Executives usually have at least some compensation in stock or options which gives the executives an incentive to raise the stock price.

If they do a secondary offering however they could raise a lot of capital. Usually this lowers the stock price because same market cap/ more shares = less value per share. However, if GME stop raises an insane amount of capital through a secondary offering they would be in a much better position which would make the company more attractive.",monditrand,46,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9pw6h/i_just_like_this_stock/gljuipj/,0.067,0.776,0.157,0.8346

All of the bullion dealers have had their inventory just absolutely cleaned out. JMBullion, APMEX, Money Metals, like every bullion dealer had its inventory just absolutely washed out on friday and saturday, with last movers trying to pick through the scraps on sunday.

It's all rather weird, I've watched silver for many years, and have quite the hoard of shiny rocks, but I have a lot of visibility here and on /biz/ and I just don't know what drove this so hard on friday. I've seen people talking about it in a lot of places, but not sure how that all came out.

Not sure what to think of it. That being said, it's always worth hedging against currency collapse with physical silver if you have the spare cash and just want to, but the time to try and squeeze the physical supply of silver would be *after* GME has ran its course, and tons of us have powered ourselves up with fresh capital after feeding on Melvins corpse.

2997,GME," From the looks of it, over the past few days publicity has increased but volume has decreased. This can only mean one thing, that the float is being eaten up and GME is running out of shares for investors to buy. This is a good thing. As shares run out, eventually brokers will be forced to margin call short sellers when new investors try to buy a share, and none exist. They will take it from the short sellers (HFs), forcing them to cover their short and close it out. (In fact, the HF doesn't do this at all, the brokerage automatically does this). It means that we are close to forcing a squeeze on retail investing alone. Buy and hold! Volume going down day to day just means we're getting closer and closer

3101,AN," The Night Before Market Open.

'Twas the night before Market open, and we all held. 
our stock;  
in hopes that Melvin’s wife would soon suck on our cock.  

The shares had been moved from Robinhood with fear,  
knowing The Squeeze soon would be here.

The autists were nestled all snug in their beds,  
While visions of tendies danced in their heads.  
And u/zjz in their 'kerchief, and I in my sweater,  
Had just settled down to do some blow together.  

When outside the house there arose such a clatter,  
I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter!  
Away to the window I flew like a flash,  
Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash;  

The moon, on the breast of the new-fallen snow. 
Gave the lustre of GAINS to objects below;  

When, there my eyes beheld,  
A miniature Rocket! with a posse of whales!  
And a little old driver, who could it be?  
I knew in a moment, it was DFV.  

More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,  
And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name;  

“Now, ELON! now, CHAMATH! now, MARK and RYAN!  
Plenty more shares still need buying!  
They shorted the stock, their money is ours;  
We’re taking this motherfucker to Mars!  
As shares are bought up, their value goes high,  
so have 💎 🙌🏻 and continue to buy!”  

So up to the moon the coursers they flew,  
With the sleigh full of tendies, and DFV too.  
He plummeted down into the yard,  
telling me “Hold the dip, it’s not that hard.”

He was dressed all in fur, except for his band,
And a diamond tattoo he had on his hand.
A bag of tendies he had flung on his back,  
And he looked like a peddler just opening his pack. 
A wink of his eye and a twist of his head,  
Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread;  

He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,  
He bought all the stocks, then turned with a jerk,  
And laying his finger aside of his nose,  
And giving a nod, took some blow up his nose.
He sprang to his Rocket, to his team gave a whistle,  
And away they all flew with the speed of a missile.  
But I heard him exclaim, as he flew towards the stars,
“WHAT’S AN EXIT STRATEGY? I’ll SEE YOU ON MARS!”

3272,RH,"  Any of you more talented window lickers ever think about setting up a new brokerage site? If all of the current brokerage firms are guilty of embellishing the hedge fund short sell mentality, and other nefarious actions, would it make sense for us to form a site just for us retards to trade on. Just a thought. Maybe call it ""Nottingham"". I'm sure you wouldn't have a problem with membership since [r/wallstreebets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreebets/) seems to now be the largest hedge fund in the world.

3316,GME," I think the biggest thing missing there is the aging of the shorts. 

I think everyone can admit that right now Gamestop is way overvalued because of the high demand due to over shorting of the stock. What that means is that at some point down the road it will go back down. That means that, for those who can take the risk, it isn't a bad time to take new shorts on Gamestop. So, maybe there is still 110% of the stock shorted, but if they paid back 80% of the old shorts and they (or other funds) took new shorts where their breakeven is at like GME $220/share, then they can absolutely wait out longer than the retail traders for the price to dip back down.",xahhfink6,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9qxmz/goldman_sachs_says_this_is_the_biggest_short/glkfzzv/,0.034,0.916,0.051,0.4897

This caused the price to 🚀🚀🚀. The danger sneks DIDN'T LIKE THAT, because they BORROWED the shares they SOLD, and they would have to RETURN THEM.

3338,GME," The other two major options are:

1. regulatory capture (i.e. government intervention)
2. squeeze the last remaining brokerages who haven't throttled trading of GME

And I am not sure that your option 3 is that viable right now, who is lending their GME stock right now? Not nearly enough on the market to more than dent the demand.",sblinn,47,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9qxmz/goldman_sachs_says_this_is_the_biggest_short/glk8dl7/,0.06,0.94,0.0,-0.3532
3339,GME," My guess is the 3rd option will be used. They'll patch the bleeding interest rates with new funding (they have new investors) and short at the higher prices either with retail investor's shorts they convince brokers to allow to be shorted, or with naked shorts. Once Reddit loses interest again, they hope the lack of new buyers and continued low volume (even with holders) will drive the price down and they can cover their new high shorts for more capital to keep stopping the bleeding until the price naturally drops. Then they can phase out their old shorts over a few weeks, matching supply with demand to stop from raising the price dramatically. It's expensive in interest fees, but it might be less expensive enough to avoid bankruptcy outright, and they can pad losses with shorts from these high peaks.

In fact, having a controlled and limited amount of new retail buyers now could help them when shorting these peaks because they'll have retail investors willing to pay $325+ to get into the GME rocket when other investors and institutional investors would refuse.

**This is what the shorts are doing right now.**

**Dont feel like reading a novel? The short and dirty (TLDR AT THE FUCKING BOTTOM):**

 
Short Attack:

1. Sell **fake**, COUNTERFEIT stocks between hedge funds and increasingly lower ask prices to try to scare other investors into selling and/or to trigger limit sell price points. They've been doing this all week. Each major price drop has been because of this tactic.


2. Get the media to spread fear, doubt, and uncertainty. Anyone watching CNBC this week has seen this in action.


3. Spread disinformation through ""analysis"" to get people to sell their stocks because ""the fundamentals aren't there"". Again, this is all over the place right now.


4. Open class action lawsuits against the company/shareholders claiming they're artificially inflating the stock price. Haven't seen it yet, but they've definitely threatened it.


5. Get the government/SEC involved alleging the same as #4. Definitely happening.


6. Pull margin shares and sell them. As seen being done by Robinhood over the last two days.


7. Spread FUD on message boards. Hello 4 million new subs pushing AMC, BB, SLV, etc.

Basically this past week has been 9/10 of the tactics in the short attack playbook to try to either push Gamestop into bankruptcy so they can profit on their short positions or slowly gain them back when people sell their stocks.

Confused what **counterfeited stock** means? Some light reading that /u/draemon_   provided explains it perfectly but beware, you actually have to read something:

* Jim Cramer, in a video-taped interview with The Street.com, best described the media function:

When (shorting) ... The hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful, because the truth is so against your view, (so the hedge funds) create a new 'truth' that is development of the fiction... you hit the brokerage houses with a series of orders (a short down ladder that pushes the price down), then we go to the press. You have a vicious cycle down - it's a pretty good game.*

**Yet more support for the at times illegal and unethical nature of these practices: (THANK YOU, /u/catolicquotes**

**Pulling Margin** from long customers during a short attack serves two purposes. Obviously the flood of shares that are “forced” sales help drive the price down, which aids the short cause in general. More important, for the broker dealers who clear for their retail customers at the same time they short against them, it creates a built-in source of cheap shares from which they can cover their open short positions.

Some of the **broker dealers short against their retail customers** from their proprietary trading desks, or “prop” desks. These are trades owned by the broker dealer, and, while they are not illegal, ethical questions certainly exist. The retail customers, who may be purchasing long investments that are being pushed by the broker dealer's retail network, have no inkling that the broker is taking a large short position contrary to the retail investor's position. With the encouragement of easy margin credit, i.e. 30% equity, the retail customers load up on stock and margin debt.

**The broker dealer, in concert with other shorts, may crash the stock by flooding the board with counterfeit shares, dropping the stock price**. The broker dealers know the amount of margin debt and the price at which their retail customers get into margin trouble. They can accelerate the squeeze on their retail customers by arbitrarily increasing the equity (percentage) requirement as the price is dropping, **frequently citing “volatility”**; which is really the shorts flooding the board with counterfeit shares.

The compounding effect of a dropping price and increasing equity requirement flushes out more shares. The broker dealers sometimes will take over the account during a margin sell-off. By engaging in poor trading practices, such as heavy selling over lunch hour; concentrated “dumps” of shares; hitting the bid with market orders; and conspiring with other trading desks, **they can further plummet the value of the stock and maximize the shares they have stripped from their retail customers**.

Most of the broker dealers who have both retail customers and prop-desk trading appear to engage in these practices. Goldman, Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch have been named in suits alleging these practices. Goldman made billions shorting against the subprime mortgage industry at the same time they were selling subprime investments to their customers.

Confused what **counterfeited stock** means? Some light reading that /u/draemon_   provided explains it perfectly but beware, you actually have to read something:

You have a vicious cycle down - it's a pretty good game.*

**Pulling Margin** from long customers during a short attack serves two purposes. Obviously the flood of shares that are “forced” sales help drive the price down, which aids the short cause in general. More important, for the broker dealers who clear for their retail customers at the same time they short against them, it creates a built-in source of cheap shares from which they can cover their open short positions.

Some of the **broker dealers short against their retail customers** from their proprietary trading desks, or “prop” desks. These are trades owned by the broker dealer, and, while they are not illegal, ethical questions certainly exist. The retail customers, who may be purchasing long investments that are being pushed by the broker dealer's retail network, have no inkling that the broker is taking a large short position contrary to the retail investor's position. With the encouragement of easy margin credit, i.e. 30% equity, the retail customers load up on stock and margin debt.

**The broker dealer, in concert with other shorts, may crash the stock by flooding the board with counterfeit shares, dropping the stock price**. The broker dealers know the amount of margin debt and the price at which their retail customers get into margin trouble. They can accelerate the squeeze on their retail customers by arbitrarily increasing the equity (percentage) requirement as the price is dropping, **frequently citing “volatility”**; which is really the shorts flooding the board with counterfeit shares.

The compounding effect of a dropping price and increasing equity requirement flushes out more shares. The broker dealers sometimes will take over the account during a margin sell-off. By engaging in poor trading practices, such as heavy selling over lunch hour; concentrated “dumps” of shares; hitting the bid with market orders; and conspiring with other trading desks, **they can further plummet the value of the stock and maximize the shares they have stripped from their retail customers**.

Most of the broker dealers who have both retail customers and prop-desk trading appear to engage in these practices. Goldman, Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch have been named in suits alleging these practices. Goldman made billions shorting against the subprime mortgage industry at the same time they were selling subprime investments to their customers.

Short Attack:

1. Sell **fake**, COUNTERFEIT stocks between hedge funds and increasingly lower ask prices to try to scare other investors into selling and/or to trigger limit sell price points. They've been doing this all week. Each major price drop has been because of this tactic.


2. Get the media to spread fear, doubt, and uncertainty. Anyone watching CNBC this week has seen this in action.


3. Spread disinformation through ""analysis"" to get people to sell their stocks because ""the fundamentals aren't there"". Again, this is all over the place right now.


4. Open class action lawsuits against the company/shareholders claiming they're artificially inflating the stock price. Haven't seen it yet, but they've definitely threatened it.


5. Get the government/SEC involved alleging the same as #4. Definitely happening.


6. Pull margin shares and sell them. As seen being done by Robinhood over the last two days.

**Yet more support for the at times illegal and unethical nature of these practices: (THANK YOU,** [/u/catolicquotes](https://www.reddit.com/u/catolicquotes/)

**Pulling Margin** from long customers during a short attack serves two purposes. Obviously the flood of shares that are “forced” sales help drive the price down, which aids the short cause in general. More important, for the broker dealers who clear for their retail customers at the same time they short against them, it creates a built-in source of cheap shares from which they can cover their open short positions.

Some of the **broker dealers short against their retail customers** from their proprietary trading desks, or “prop” desks. These are trades owned by the broker dealer, and, while they are not illegal, ethical questions certainly exist. The retail customers, who may be purchasing long investments that are being pushed by the broker dealer's retail network, have no inkling that the broker is taking a large short position contrary to the retail investor's position. With the encouragement of easy margin credit, i.e. 30% equity, the retail customers load up on stock and margin debt.

**The broker dealer, in concert with other shorts, may crash the stock by flooding the board with counterfeit shares, dropping the stock price**. The broker dealers know the amount of margin debt and the price at which their retail customers get into margin trouble. They can accelerate the squeeze on their retail customers by arbitrarily increasing the equity (percentage) requirement as the price is dropping, **frequently citing “volatility”**; which is really the shorts flooding the board with counterfeit shares.

The compounding effect of a dropping price and increasing equity requirement flushes out more shares. The broker dealers sometimes will take over the account during a margin sell-off. By engaging in poor trading practices, such as heavy selling over lunch hour; concentrated “dumps” of shares; hitting the bid with market orders; and conspiring with other trading desks, **they can further plummet the value of the stock and maximize the shares they have stripped from their retail customers**.

Most of the broker dealers who have both retail customers and prop-desk trading appear to engage in these practices. Goldman, Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch have been named in suits alleging these practices. Goldman made billions shorting against the subprime mortgage industry at the same time they were selling subprime investments to their customers.

See all the ""perfect"" orders (e.g. 100, 200, 300 shares) of nice whole numbers in the hundreds, with scattered ""imperfect orders"" (e.g. 134, 194 shares)? Notice how the nice, whole numbered orders are very predictable in pricing which varies cents off of one another?

**This is what the shorts are doing right now.**

**Dont feel like reading a novel? The short and dirty (TLDR AT THE FUCKING BOTTOM):**

Short Attack:

1. Sell **fake**, COUNTERFEIT stocks between hedge funds and increasingly lower ask prices to try to scare other investors into selling and/or to trigger limit sell price points. They've been doing this all week. Each major price drop has been because of this tactic.
2. Get the media to spread fear, doubt, and uncertainty. Anyone watching CNBC this week has seen this in action.
3. Spread disinformation through ""analysis"" to get people to sell their stocks because ""the fundamentals aren't there"". Again, this is all over the place right now.
4. Open class action lawsuits against the company/shareholders claiming they're artificially inflating the stock price. Haven't seen it yet, but they've definitely threatened it.
5. Get the government/SEC involved alleging the same as #4. Definitely happening.
6. Pull margin shares and sell them. As seen being done by Robinhood over the last two days.
7. Spread FUD on message boards. Hello 4 million new subs pushing AMC, BB, SLV, etc.

however.

3411,GME," The ""perfect buys of 100"" thing is totally unreliable. Algos probably just buy in batches of 100 for any stock. [This](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/amzn/latest-real-time-trades) is Amazon's latest trades. Tons of buys in multiples of 100. [GE](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/ge/real-time), just about the most boring stock I can think of, is also perfect batches of 100. I don't know where anyone is getting that orders of 100 mean it's manipulated. Yes, GME is probably manipulated out the ass, we know that, but the price might very well be dropping organically. AND THAT'S OKAY! That doesn't mean anything has changed in the market mechanics, that just means the price is going down. If the short squeeze is gonna squeeze, it'll squeeze at $300 or $30, it doesn't matter. 

&#x200B;

It is almost certain that Melvin and Co have covered their original shorts at $6 and re-shorted at the current price. They're betting the stock will go down enough and that people will lose interest so that they can cover their shorts over a very long period of time and still profit. I'm not saying the squeeze won't squoze, but in order for that to happen, all lenders must call back the shares they lent in a similar timeframe. With the amount that lenders are making on interest for this stock and the amount of collusion and corruption going on, I don't see that happening for a long long time. Melvin will gladly lose 25M a day for months if it means they don't liquidate their entire firm in full public view. VW was different, as the announcement that Porsche had locked up a high fraction of the public float meant that at the time of the squeeze, VW had a much higher short interest than GME.

&#x200B;

I don't know why they're pushing silver so hard, but my only bet is that they're trying to direct mainstream attention and paper-hands away from GameStop so that this doesn't happen so publicly. Maybe they're trying to drive the price down enough to cover their new shorts and get out on top. These are smart guys, they know we plan on holding til we die. They've factored that into their decisions and are now doing with that what they are going to do anyway. What I'm trying to say is don't expect anything to happen for a while, if not ever.

**This is what the shorts are doing right now.**

**Dont feel like reading a novel? The short and dirty (TLDR AT THE FUCKING BOTTOM):**

 
Short Attack:

1. Sell **fake**, COUNTERFEIT stocks between hedge funds and increasingly lower ask prices to try to scare other investors into selling and/or to trigger limit sell price points. They've been doing this all week. Each major price drop has been because of this tactic.


2. Get the media to spread fear, doubt, and uncertainty. Anyone watching CNBC this week has seen this in action.


3. Spread disinformation through ""analysis"" to get people to sell their stocks because ""the fundamentals aren't there"". Again, this is all over the place right now.


4. Open class action lawsuits against the company/shareholders claiming they're artificially inflating the stock price. Haven't seen it yet, but they've definitely threatened it.


5. Get the government/SEC involved alleging the same as #4. Definitely happening.


6. Pull margin shares and sell them. As seen being done by Robinhood over the last two days.


7. Spread FUD on message boards. Hello 4 million new subs pushing AMC, BB, SLV, etc.

Basically this past week has been 9/10 of the tactics in the short attack playbook to try to either push Gamestop into bankruptcy so they can profit on their short positions or slowly gain them back when people sell their stocks.

* Jim Cramer, in a video-taped interview with The Street.com, best described the media function:

When (shorting) ... The hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful, because the truth is so against your view, (so the hedge funds) create a new 'truth' that is development of the fiction... you hit the brokerage houses with a series of orders (a short down ladder that pushes the price down), then we go to the press. You have a vicious cycle down - it's a pretty good game.*

**Yet more support for the at times illegal and unethical nature of these practices: (THANK YOU, /u/catolicquotes**

**Pulling Margin** from long customers during a short attack serves two purposes. Obviously the flood of shares that are “forced” sales help drive the price down, which aids the short cause in general. More important, for the broker dealers who clear for their retail customers at the same time they short against them, it creates a built-in source of cheap shares from which they can cover their open short positions.

Some of the **broker dealers short against their retail customers** from their proprietary trading desks, or “prop” desks. These are trades owned by the broker dealer, and, while they are not illegal, ethical questions certainly exist. The retail customers, who may be purchasing long investments that are being pushed by the broker dealer's retail network, have no inkling that the broker is taking a large short position contrary to the retail investor's position. With the encouragement of easy margin credit, i.e. 30% equity, the retail customers load up on stock and margin debt.

**The broker dealer, in concert with other shorts, may crash the stock by flooding the board with counterfeit shares, dropping the stock price**. The broker dealers know the amount of margin debt and the price at which their retail customers get into margin trouble. They can accelerate the squeeze on their retail customers by arbitrarily increasing the equity (percentage) requirement as the price is dropping, **frequently citing “volatility”**; which is really the shorts flooding the board with counterfeit shares.

The compounding effect of a dropping price and increasing equity requirement flushes out more shares. The broker dealers sometimes will take over the account during a margin sell-off. By engaging in poor trading practices, such as heavy selling over lunch hour; concentrated “dumps” of shares; hitting the bid with market orders; and conspiring with other trading desks, **they can further plummet the value of the stock and maximize the shares they have stripped from their retail customers**.

Most of the broker dealers who have both retail customers and prop-desk trading appear to engage in these practices. Goldman, Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch have been named in suits alleging these practices. Goldman made billions shorting against the subprime mortgage industry at the same time they were selling subprime investments to their customers.

**This interview, which is more like a confession, was never supposed to get on the air; however, it somehow ended up on YouTube. Cramer and The Street.com have made repeated efforts, with some success, to get it taken off of YouTube. (THANKS for this info, /u/blancochocolate)**

* Jim Cramer, in a video-taped interview with The Street.com, best described the media function:

When (shorting) ... The hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful, because the truth is so against your view, (so the hedge funds) create a new 'truth' that is development of the fiction... you hit the brokerage houses with a series of orders (a short down ladder that pushes the price down), then we go to the press. You have a vicious cycle down - it's a pretty good game.*

Investopedia [""Short and Distort"" - illegal short tactic ](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/analyst/030102.asp#:~:text=Short%20and%20distort%20(S%26D)

**Yet more support for the at times illegal and unethical nature of these practices: (THANK YOU, /u/catolicquotes**

**Pulling Margin** from long customers during a short attack serves two purposes. Obviously the flood of shares that are “forced” sales help drive the price down, which aids the short cause in general. More important, for the broker dealers who clear for their retail customers at the same time they short against them, it creates a built-in source of cheap shares from which they can cover their open short positions.

Some of the **broker dealers short against their retail customers** from their proprietary trading desks, or “prop” desks. These are trades owned by the broker dealer, and, while they are not illegal, ethical questions certainly exist. The retail customers, who may be purchasing long investments that are being pushed by the broker dealer's retail network, have no inkling that the broker is taking a large short position contrary to the retail investor's position. With the encouragement of easy margin credit, i.e. 30% equity, the retail customers load up on stock and margin debt.

**The broker dealer, in concert with other shorts, may crash the stock by flooding the board with counterfeit shares, dropping the stock price**. The broker dealers know the amount of margin debt and the price at which their retail customers get into margin trouble. They can accelerate the squeeze on their retail customers by arbitrarily increasing the equity (percentage) requirement as the price is dropping, **frequently citing “volatility”**; which is really the shorts flooding the board with counterfeit shares.

The compounding effect of a dropping price and increasing equity requirement flushes out more shares. The broker dealers sometimes will take over the account during a margin sell-off. By engaging in poor trading practices, such as heavy selling over lunch hour; concentrated “dumps” of shares; hitting the bid with market orders; and conspiring with other trading desks, **they can further plummet the value of the stock and maximize the shares they have stripped from their retail customers**.

Most of the broker dealers who have both retail customers and prop-desk trading appear to engage in these practices. Goldman, Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch have been named in suits alleging these practices. Goldman made billions shorting against the subprime mortgage industry at the same time they were selling subprime investments to their customers.

**This is what the shorts are doing right now.**

**Dont feel like reading a novel? The short and dirty (TLDR AT THE FUCKING BOTTOM):**

Short Attack:

1. Sell **fake**, COUNTERFEIT stocks between hedge funds and increasingly lower ask prices to try to scare other investors into selling and/or to trigger limit sell price points. They've been doing this all week. Each major price drop has been because of this tactic.
2. Get the media to spread fear, doubt, and uncertainty. Anyone watching CNBC this week has seen this in action.
3. Spread disinformation through ""analysis"" to get people to sell their stocks because ""the fundamentals aren't there"". Again, this is all over the place right now.
4. Open class action lawsuits against the company/shareholders claiming they're artificially inflating the stock price. Haven't seen it yet, but they've definitely threatened it.
5. Get the government/SEC involved alleging the same as #4. Definitely happening.
6. Pull margin shares and sell them. As seen being done by Robinhood over the last two days.
7. Spread FUD on message boards. Hello 4 million new subs pushing AMC, BB, SLV, etc.

Basically this past week has been 9/10 of the tactics in the short attack playbook to try to either push Gamestop into bankruptcy so they can profit on their short positions or slowly gain them back when people sell their stocks.

* Jim Cramer, in a video-taped interview with The Street.com, best described the media function:

When (shorting) ... The hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful, because the truth is so against your view, (so the hedge funds) create a new 'truth' that is development of the fiction... you hit the brokerage houses with a series of orders (a short down ladder that pushes the price down), then we go to the press.

**Yet more support for the at times illegal and unethical nature of these practices: (THANK YOU,** [/u/catolicquotes](https://www.reddit.com/u/catolicquotes/)

**Pulling Margin** from long customers during a short attack serves two purposes. Obviously the flood of shares that are “forced” sales help drive the price down, which aids the short cause in general. More important, for the broker dealers who clear for their retail customers at the same time they short against them, it creates a built-in source of cheap shares from which they can cover their open short positions.

Some of the **broker dealers short against their retail customers** from their proprietary trading desks, or “prop” desks. These are trades owned by the broker dealer, and, while they are not illegal, ethical questions certainly exist. The retail customers, who may be purchasing long investments that are being pushed by the broker dealer's retail network, have no inkling that the broker is taking a large short position contrary to the retail investor's position. With the encouragement of easy margin credit, i.e. 30% equity, the retail customers load up on stock and margin debt.

**The broker dealer, in concert with other shorts, may crash the stock by flooding the board with counterfeit shares, dropping the stock price**. The broker dealers know the amount of margin debt and the price at which their retail customers get into margin trouble. They can accelerate the squeeze on their retail customers by arbitrarily increasing the equity (percentage) requirement as the price is dropping, **frequently citing “volatility”**; which is really the shorts flooding the board with counterfeit shares.

The compounding effect of a dropping price and increasing equity requirement flushes out more shares. The broker dealers sometimes will take over the account during a margin sell-off. By engaging in poor trading practices, such as heavy selling over lunch hour; concentrated “dumps” of shares; hitting the bid with market orders; and conspiring with other trading desks, **they can further plummet the value of the stock and maximize the shares they have stripped from their retail customers**.

Most of the broker dealers who have both retail customers and prop-desk trading appear to engage in these practices. Goldman, Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch have been named in suits alleging these practices. Goldman made billions shorting against the subprime mortgage industry at the same time they were selling subprime investments to their customers.

Within the next 18 days 30,000,000 shorted GME shares need to be covered (bought) by the hedgies - see link below.

At today’s price of approx $300 per share- that’s $9 Billion + the premium being paid for having the position.

How long does the line need to be held? 18 days

3642,GME," For anyone watching the GME situation (all of us?), consider these relevant points and taking the relevant actions:

1. Big money is MORTIFIED and the retaliation is completely unprecedented: coordinated attacks, willingness to risk prison over financial loss, concealing data, etc. They're shaking because we're holding GME. Despite any other lack of information available, this may be the best signal for why you should hold. Period.

2. After the massive GME rise, there was a LOT of bot activity trying to distract, dissuade, etc. They're poisoning the well, and it's difficult to know what can be trusted and what can't. The one thing we DEFINITELY know, however, is that all of those attacks are being done to make us sell GME and spin the narrative that the complicit agents are victims / good guys.

3. Robinhood + Citadel are trying to spin a BS narrative. If your institution can't afford something, shut everything down equally and go bankrupt. Choosing a specific stock to shut down is perhaps the most egregiously corrupt action ever taken in the market (which is saying A LOT). YOU weren't allowed to buy when major funds were, especially at CRITICAL times with CRITICAL buying opportunities to protect Citadel + big money and it collectively cost us tens of billions in lost opportunity. They're being sued, and rightfully so, but laws need to change to ruthlessly punish them NOW. Contact your representatives, SEC, etc. if you haven't already.

4. Hedges might lie about their short positions, or restrict visibility as much as possible. They can break laws and face negligible fees by comparison to the rest of what they stand to lose. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume they might do this among many other PR stunts to terrify you. Keep updated. Someone pointed out that iborrowdesk is no longer reporting on updated gme because, again, the legal consequences don't matter enough and they're protecting their interests. Refer to #1.

5. We don't know WHEN short positions will be covered, only the math that requires them to cover as we move forward. So if they delay and everyone gives in, they could save a lot of money. However, the longer they delay, the more they have to pay. So it's a matter of whether or not they double down and face higher risk/reward or not. Be prepared to WAIT.

6. If you set visible limits, the hedge funds can use this data to their advantage and potentially have attack vectors against us. However, if you don't set limits, you might miss out on major trading spikes when they happen. The selfless act is to avoid low limits, but the ultimate goal is to distribute wealth to the people so take if you're the people who need it.

7. If you're angry at Robinhood, move accounts AFTER this is over so that you're not frozen. Also, DO NOT transfer to your bank, because that will trigger a tax event. You're supposed to transfer between brokers. Look into this further yourself, since I'm not a tax expert.

8. If you're angry at Google for removing negative Robinhood accounts, use Ecosia instead. They're just as user friendly, effective, and they give 80% of their profits to green energy and planting trees. Google will lose hundreds or thousands of dollars per year from your ad revenue and data collection.

9. It's hard to anticipate what other stunts will be pulled to try to screw us over. Contact your representatives, particularly those in finance committees and demand REAL consequences for this criminal behavior. This matters.

3652,GME," Regarding SCHWAB

The only issue I had, as well as others, was getting an error message of, "" this ticker isn't valid"". And we couldn't execute buy or sell orders EASILY. HOWEVER, it did end up working that same day. You just had to keep refreshing.

Now, that did affect my trust personally. BUT, it really did seem to be a high traffic volume related error. You have to keep in mind that many brokerages had a HUGE explosion of people trying to execute orders at the same time. It's been an abnormal amount of traffic.

MANY brokerages experienced glitches and issues.

My fellow Australians, there's very little decent brokerages for us left.
​
Stake
I'm using Stake and it's ass but it kinda works.
Stake was super slow last week but I was actual able to purchase GME at market.
Idk if its because I had the app and website open and didn't refresh before trading started.
Or whether it's because I didn't do any pre market orders or limits.
​
Alternatives which others say are good.
Good alternatives would be Commsec, Plus500 and Self Wealth . I can't say first hand, so this is based off other Aussies. But I'm continuing to use Stake because most of my funds are in it and its been working for me, although slow. IG has fallen and only allow for selling. >:(
If you want use my code for Stake so I get a free share to sell and put back in GME- edeni939

3665,OR," Call me special, but I think Robin Hood made an error in it's calculations of restrictions on shares. I was trying to think how they would code the restrictions and there may be a fully legal loophole that they could get in trouble for blocking. As options contracts are just that... legal contracts.

They will allow you to buy X number of call options depending in what company your looking to buy into.

The allow you to exercise your call option early AND in OR out of the money. Theoretically a close dated far ITM call would allow you to purchase 100 shares for within close proximity of current market value.

Continuing on, it is my understanding that the restrictions on options are the amount in your account at a given time, NOT a historical amount you have purchased. So as long as you keep exercising you should be able to keep purchasing stocks around the limit.

Just wanted to try and help anyone who is stuck on Robin Hood due to shares being tied up and wanting to have the power to pursue their own decisions.

Good Luck Autists and HOLD!

3708,SO," Don't panic

I use Schwab too

The only issue I had, as well as others, was getting an error message of, "" this ticker isn't valid"". And we couldn't execute buy or sell orders easily. HOWEVER, it did end up working that same day. You just had to keep refreshing.

Now, that did affect my trust personally. BUT, it really did seem to be a high traffic volume related error. You have to keep in mind that many brokerages had a HUGE explosion of people trying to execute orders at the same time. It's been an abnormal amount of traffic.

MANY brokerages experienced glitches and issues.

**Get ready for FUD (Fear Uncertainty Doubt) campaigns . It's already starting.**

The number of posts with supposed ""level headed"" advice about how a short squeeze is much more difficult to achieve than we all think, how other stocks are also valuable, and how the strong and powerful hedge funds have much more cards up their sleeve and to ""rethink your strategy"" but still ""Go GME!! I am one of you guys!"", always with a few rewards sticked to them, is exploding and will be getting progressively worse in the weekend most certainly.

Does a post sow Fear, or Uncertainty, or Doubt in any way in you? Think for yourself.

Hedge Fund interns have now learned how reddit works and want to part you with your GME shares.

ALWAYS check the up / downvote ratio and read the comments before getting swayed by whatever semi correct sounding bullshit they're spouting. Oh how desperate they now have become.

**This is what the shorts are doing right now.**

**Dont feel like reading a novel? The short and dirty (TLDR AT THE FUCKING BOTTOM):**

 
Short Attack:

1. Sell **fake**, COUNTERFEIT stocks between hedge funds and increasingly lower ask prices to try to scare other investors into selling and/or to trigger limit sell price points. They've been doing this all week. Each major price drop has been because of this tactic.


2. Get the media to spread fear, doubt, and uncertainty. Anyone watching CNBC this week has seen this in action.


3. Spread disinformation through ""analysis"" to get people to sell their stocks because ""the fundamentals aren't there"". Again, this is all over the place right now.


4. Open class action lawsuits against the company/shareholders claiming they're artificially inflating the stock price. Haven't seen it yet, but they've definitely threatened it.


5. Get the government/SEC involved alleging the same as #4. Definitely happening.


6. Pull margin shares and sell them. As seen being done by Robinhood over the last two days.


7. Spread FUD on message boards. Hello 4 million new subs pushing AMC, BB, SLV, etc.

Basically this past week has been 9/10 of the tactics in the short attack playbook to try to either push Gamestop into bankruptcy so they can profit on their short positions or slowly gain them back when people sell their stocks.

Confused what **counterfeited stock** means? Some light reading that /u/draemon_   provided explains it perfectly but beware, you actually have to read something:

* Jim Cramer, in a video-taped interview with The Street.com, best described the media function:

When (shorting) ... The hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful, because the truth is so against your view, (so the hedge funds) create a new 'truth' that is development of the fiction... you hit the brokerage houses with a series of orders (a short down ladder that pushes the price down), then we go to the press. You have a vicious cycle down - it's a pretty good game.*

**Yet more support for the at times illegal and unethical nature of these practices: (THANK YOU, /u/catolicquotes**

**Pulling Margin** from long customers during a short attack serves two purposes. Obviously the flood of shares that are “forced” sales help drive the price down, which aids the short cause in general. More important, for the broker dealers who clear for their retail customers at the same time they short against them, it creates a built-in source of cheap shares from which they can cover their open short positions.

Some of the **broker dealers short against their retail customers** from their proprietary trading desks, or “prop” desks. These are trades owned by the broker dealer, and, while they are not illegal, ethical questions certainly exist. The retail customers, who may be purchasing long investments that are being pushed by the broker dealer's retail network, have no inkling that the broker is taking a large short position contrary to the retail investor's position. With the encouragement of easy margin credit, i.e. 30% equity, the retail customers load up on stock and margin debt.

**The broker dealer, in concert with other shorts, may crash the stock by flooding the board with counterfeit shares, dropping the stock price**. The broker dealers know the amount of margin debt and the price at which their retail customers get into margin trouble. They can accelerate the squeeze on their retail customers by arbitrarily increasing the equity (percentage) requirement as the price is dropping, **frequently citing “volatility”**; which is really the shorts flooding the board with counterfeit shares.

The compounding effect of a dropping price and increasing equity requirement flushes out more shares. The broker dealers sometimes will take over the account during a margin sell-off. By engaging in poor trading practices, such as heavy selling over lunch hour; concentrated “dumps” of shares; hitting the bid with market orders; and conspiring with other trading desks, **they can further plummet the value of the stock and maximize the shares they have stripped from their retail customers**.

Most of the broker dealers who have both retail customers and prop-desk trading appear to engage in these practices. Goldman, Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch have been named in suits alleging these practices. Goldman made billions shorting against the subprime mortgage industry at the same time they were selling subprime investments to their customers.

With the encouragement of easy margin credit, i.e. 30% equity, the retail customers load up on stock and margin debt.

**The broker dealer, in concert with other shorts, may crash the stock by flooding the board with counterfeit shares, dropping the stock price**. The broker dealers know the amount of margin debt and the price at which their retail customers get into margin trouble. They can accelerate the squeeze on their retail customers by arbitrarily increasing the equity (percentage) requirement as the price is dropping, **frequently citing “volatility”**; which is really the shorts flooding the board with counterfeit shares.

The compounding effect of a dropping price and increasing equity requirement flushes out more shares. The broker dealers sometimes will take over the account during a margin sell-off. By engaging in poor trading practices, such as heavy selling over lunch hour; concentrated “dumps” of shares; hitting the bid with market orders; and conspiring with other trading desks, **they can further plummet the value of the stock and maximize the shares they have stripped from their retail customers**.

Most of the broker dealers who have both retail customers and prop-desk trading appear to engage in these practices. Goldman, Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch have been named in suits alleging these practices. Goldman made billions shorting against the subprime mortgage industry at the same time they were selling subprime investments to their customers.

Check out real time transactions here: https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/latest-real-time-trades

See all the ""perfect"" orders (e.g. 100, 200, 300 shares) of nice whole numbers in the hundreds, with scattered ""imperfect orders""  (e.g. 134, 194 shares)? Notice how the nice, whole numbered orders are very predictable in pricing which varies cents off of one another? 

It's a coordinated attack. Hold and chill. This isn't financial advice, just sharing something new.

**This is what the shorts are doing right now.**

**Dont feel like reading a novel? The short and dirty (TLDR AT THE FUCKING BOTTOM):**

 
Short Attack:

1. Sell **fake**, COUNTERFEIT stocks between hedge funds and increasingly lower ask prices to try to scare other investors into selling and/or to trigger limit sell price points. They've been doing this all week. Each major price drop has been because of this tactic.


2. Get the media to spread fear, doubt, and uncertainty. Anyone watching CNBC this week has seen this in action.


3. Spread disinformation through ""analysis"" to get people to sell their stocks because ""the fundamentals aren't there"". Again, this is all over the place right now.


4. Open class action lawsuits against the company/shareholders claiming they're artificially inflating the stock price. Haven't seen it yet, but they've definitely threatened it.


5. Get the government/SEC involved alleging the same as #4. Definitely happening.


6. Pull margin shares and sell them. As seen being done by Robinhood over the last two days.


7. Spread FUD on message boards. Hello 4 million new subs pushing AMC, BB, SLV, etc.

Basically this past week has been 9/10 of the tactics in the short attack playbook to try to either push Gamestop into bankruptcy so they can profit on their short positions or slowly gain them back when people sell their stocks.

Confused what **counterfeited stock** means? Some light reading that /u/draemon_   provided explains it perfectly but beware, you actually have to read something:

[What does counterfeit stock mean?](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html)

**Need more proof?**

Jim Cramer himself, 
[""here's what short sellers do, it's illegal but when you have 6 days to get out and you're down you need to foment and wipe that guy out quickly"".](https://youtu.be/VMuEis3byY4)

**This interview, which is more like a confession, was never supposed to get on the air; however, it somehow ended up on YouTube. Cramer and The Street.com have made repeated efforts, with some success, to get it taken off of YouTube. (THANKS for this info, /u/blancochocolate)**

* Jim Cramer, in a video-taped interview with The Street.com, best described the media function:

When (shorting) ... The hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful, because the truth is so against your view, (so the hedge funds) create a new 'truth' that is development of the fiction... you hit the brokerage houses with a series of orders (a short down ladder that pushes the price down), then we go to the press. You have a vicious cycle down - it's a pretty good game.*

Investopedia [""Short and Distort"" - illegal short tactic ](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/analyst/030102.asp#:~:text=Short%20and%20distort%20(S%26D)

**Yet more support for the at times illegal and unethical nature of these practices: (THANK YOU, /u/catolicquotes**

**Pulling Margin** from long customers during a short attack serves two purposes. Obviously the flood of shares that are “forced” sales help drive the price down, which aids the short cause in general. More important, for the broker dealers who clear for their retail customers at the same time they short against them, it creates a built-in source of cheap shares from which they can cover their open short positions.

Some of the **broker dealers short against their retail customers** from their proprietary trading desks, or “prop” desks. These are trades owned by the broker dealer, and, while they are not illegal, ethical questions certainly exist. The retail customers, who may be purchasing long investments that are being pushed by the broker dealer's retail network, have no inkling that the broker is taking a large short position contrary to the retail investor's position. With the encouragement of easy margin credit, i.e. 30% equity, the retail customers load up on stock and margin debt.

**The broker dealer, in concert with other shorts, may crash the stock by flooding the board with counterfeit shares, dropping the stock price**. The broker dealers know the amount of margin debt and the price at which their retail customers get into margin trouble. They can accelerate the squeeze on their retail customers by arbitrarily increasing the equity (percentage) requirement as the price is dropping, **frequently citing “volatility”**; which is really the shorts flooding the board with counterfeit shares.

**This is what the shorts are doing right now.**

**Dont feel like reading a novel? The short and dirty (TLDR AT THE FUCKING BOTTOM):**

 
Short Attack:

1. Sell **fake**, COUNTERFEIT stocks between hedge funds and increasingly lower ask prices to try to scare other investors into selling and/or to trigger limit sell price points. They've been doing this all week. Each major price drop has been because of this tactic.


2. Get the media to spread fear, doubt, and uncertainty. Anyone watching CNBC this week has seen this in action.


3. Spread disinformation through ""analysis"" to get people to sell their stocks because ""the fundamentals aren't there"". Again, this is all over the place right now.


4. Open class action lawsuits against the company/shareholders claiming they're artificially inflating the stock price. Haven't seen it yet, but they've definitely threatened it.


5. Get the government/SEC involved alleging the same as #4. Definitely happening.


6. Pull margin shares and sell them. As seen being done by Robinhood over the last two days.


7. Spread FUD on message boards. Hello 4 million new subs pushing AMC, BB, SLV, etc.

Basically this past week has been 9/10 of the tactics in the short attack playbook to try to either push Gamestop into bankruptcy so they can profit on their short positions or slowly gain them back when people sell their stocks.

Confused what **counterfeited stock** means? Some light reading that /u/draemon_   provided explains it perfectly but beware, you actually have to read something:

* Jim Cramer, in a video-taped interview with The Street.com, best described the media function:

When (shorting) ... The hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful, because the truth is so against your view, (so the hedge funds) create a new 'truth' that is development of the fiction... you hit the brokerage houses with a series of orders (a short down ladder that pushes the price down), then we go to the press. You have a vicious cycle down - it's a pretty good game.*

**Yet more support for the at times illegal and unethical nature of these practices: (THANK YOU, /u/catolicquotes**

**Pulling Margin** from long customers during a short attack serves two purposes. Obviously the flood of shares that are “forced” sales help drive the price down, which aids the short cause in general. More important, for the broker dealers who clear for their retail customers at the same time they short against them, it creates a built-in source of cheap shares from which they can cover their open short positions.

Some of the **broker dealers short against their retail customers** from their proprietary trading desks, or “prop” desks. These are trades owned by the broker dealer, and, while they are not illegal, ethical questions certainly exist. The retail customers, who may be purchasing long investments that are being pushed by the broker dealer's retail network, have no inkling that the broker is taking a large short position contrary to the retail investor's position. With the encouragement of easy margin credit, i.e. 30% equity, the retail customers load up on stock and margin debt.

**The broker dealer, in concert with other shorts, may crash the stock by flooding the board with counterfeit shares, dropping the stock price**. The broker dealers know the amount of margin debt and the price at which their retail customers get into margin trouble. They can accelerate the squeeze on their retail customers by arbitrarily increasing the equity (percentage) requirement as the price is dropping, **frequently citing “volatility”**; which is really the shorts flooding the board with counterfeit shares.

The compounding effect of a dropping price and increasing equity requirement flushes out more shares. The broker dealers sometimes will take over the account during a margin sell-off. By engaging in poor trading practices, such as heavy selling over lunch hour; concentrated “dumps” of shares; hitting the bid with market orders; and conspiring with other trading desks, **they can further plummet the value of the stock and maximize the shares they have stripped from their retail customers**.

Most of the broker dealers who have both retail customers and prop-desk trading appear to engage in these practices. Goldman, Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch have been named in suits alleging these practices. Goldman made billions shorting against the subprime mortgage industry at the same time they were selling subprime investments to their customers.

They can accelerate the squeeze on their retail customers by arbitrarily increasing the equity (percentage) requirement as the price is dropping, **frequently citing “volatility”**; which is really the shorts flooding the board with counterfeit shares.

The compounding effect of a dropping price and increasing equity requirement flushes out more shares. The broker dealers sometimes will take over the account during a margin sell-off. By engaging in poor trading practices, such as heavy selling over lunch hour; concentrated “dumps” of shares; hitting the bid with market orders; and conspiring with other trading desks, **they can further plummet the value of the stock and maximize the shares they have stripped from their retail customers**.

Most of the broker dealers who have both retail customers and prop-desk trading appear to engage in these practices. Goldman, Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch have been named in suits alleging these practices. Goldman made billions shorting against the subprime mortgage industry at the same time they were selling subprime investments to their customers.

**This is what the shorts are doing right now.**

**Dont feel like reading a novel? The short and dirty (TLDR AT THE FUCKING BOTTOM):**

Short Attack:

1. Sell **fake**, COUNTERFEIT stocks between hedge funds and increasingly lower ask prices to try to scare other investors into selling and/or to trigger limit sell price points. They've been doing this all week. Each major price drop has been because of this tactic.
2. Get the media to spread fear, doubt, and uncertainty. Anyone watching CNBC this week has seen this in action.
3. Spread disinformation through ""analysis"" to get people to sell their stocks because ""the fundamentals aren't there"". Again, this is all over the place right now.
4. Open class action lawsuits against the company/shareholders claiming they're artificially inflating the stock price. Haven't seen it yet, but they've definitely threatened it.
5. Get the government/SEC involved alleging the same as #4. Definitely happening.
6. Pull margin shares and sell them. As seen being done by Robinhood over the last two days.
7. Spread FUD on message boards. Hello 4 million new subs pushing AMC, BB, SLV, etc.

Basically this past week has been 9/10 of the tactics in the short attack playbook to try to either push Gamestop into bankruptcy so they can profit on their short positions or slowly gain them back when people sell their stocks.

* Jim Cramer, in a video-taped interview with The Street.com, best described the media function:

When (shorting) ... The hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful, because the truth is so against your view, (so the hedge funds) create a new 'truth' that is development of the fiction... you hit the brokerage houses with a series of orders (a short down ladder that pushes the price down), then we go to the press.

**Yet more support for the at times illegal and unethical nature of these practices: (THANK YOU,** [/u/catolicquotes](https://www.reddit.com/u/catolicquotes/)

**Pulling Margin** from long customers during a short attack serves two purposes. Obviously the flood of shares that are “forced” sales help drive the price down, which aids the short cause in general. More important, for the broker dealers who clear for their retail customers at the same time they short against them, it creates a built-in source of cheap shares from which they can cover their open short positions.

Some of the **broker dealers short against their retail customers** from their proprietary trading desks, or “prop” desks. These are trades owned by the broker dealer, and, while they are not illegal, ethical questions certainly exist. The retail customers, who may be purchasing long investments that are being pushed by the broker dealer's retail network, have no inkling that the broker is taking a large short position contrary to the retail investor's position. With the encouragement of easy margin credit, i.e. 30% equity, the retail customers load up on stock and margin debt.

**Need more proof?**

Jim Cramer himself, [""here's what short sellers do, it's illegal but when you have 6 days to get out and you're down you need to foment and wipe that guy out quickly"".](https://youtu.be/VMuEis3byY4)

**This interview, which is more like a confession, was never supposed to get on the air; however, it somehow ended up on YouTube. Cramer and The Street.com have made repeated efforts, with some success, to get it taken off of YouTube. (THANKS for this info,** [/u/blancochocolate](https://www.reddit.com/u/blancochocolate/)**)**

* Jim Cramer, in a video-taped interview with The Street.com, best described the media function:

When (shorting) ... The hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful, because the truth is so against your view, (so the hedge funds) create a new 'truth' that is development of the fiction... you hit the brokerage houses with a series of orders (a short down ladder that pushes the price down), then we go to the press. You have a vicious cycle down - it's a pretty good game.\*

Investopedia \[""Short and Distort"" - illegal short tactic \]([https://www.investopedia.com/articles/analyst/030102.asp#:\~:text=Short%20and%20distort%20(S%26D)](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/analyst/030102.asp#:~:text=Short%20and%20distort%20(S%26D))

**Yet more support for the at times illegal and unethical nature of these practices: (THANK YOU,** [/u/catolicquotes](https://www.reddit.com/u/catolicquotes/)

**Pulling Margin** from long customers during a short attack serves two purposes. Obviously the flood of shares that are “forced” sales help drive the price down, which aids the short cause in general. More important, for the broker dealers who clear for their retail customers at the same time they short against them, it creates a built-in source of cheap shares from which they can cover their open short positions.

Some of the **broker dealers short against their retail customers** from their proprietary trading desks, or “prop” desks. These are trades owned by the broker dealer, and, while they are not illegal, ethical questions certainly exist. The retail customers, who may be purchasing long investments that are being pushed by the broker dealer's retail network, have no inkling that the broker is taking a large short position contrary to the retail investor's position. With the encouragement of easy margin credit, i.e. 30% equity, the retail customers load up on stock and margin debt.

**The broker dealer, in concert with other shorts, may crash the stock by flooding the board with counterfeit shares, dropping the stock price**. The broker dealers know the amount of margin debt and the price at which their retail customers get into margin trouble. They can accelerate the squeeze on their retail customers by arbitrarily increasing the equity (percentage) requirement as the price is dropping, **frequently citing “volatility”**; which is really the shorts flooding the board with counterfeit shares.

The compounding effect of a dropping price and increasing equity requirement flushes out more shares. The broker dealers sometimes will take over the account during a margin sell-off. By engaging in poor trading practices, such as heavy selling over lunch hour; concentrated “dumps” of shares; hitting the bid with market orders; and conspiring with other trading desks, **they can further plummet the value of the stock and maximize the shares they have stripped from their retail customers**.

Most of the broker dealers who have both retail customers and prop-desk trading appear to engage in these practices. Goldman, Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch have been named in suits alleging these practices. Goldman made billions shorting against the subprime mortgage industry at the same time they were selling subprime investments to their customers.

Still TLDR: hedge funds lying in the media and selling fake stocks that don't exist to scare us. They don't know our apps don't even have a sell button, only a liftoff button for the 🚀🚀🚀

3914,AMC," •             Amid the heavy de-grossing activity occurring street-wide, funds reduced short exposure significantly on single stocks with a focus on highly volatile equities and equities with high levels of short interest. However, short exposure on equity Index ETF’s was relatively flat to slightly higher as funds stayed in broader hedges (SPY and QQQ rose while IWM was net covered). Calls for shorting being “dead” may be overstated as many funds are actively watching the highly speculative names for signs of exhaustion and opportunities to put short positions back on.

Metals - SLV (also heavily mentioned on retail blogs), GDX and GLD, are all being covered. ARKK SI has been rising as Cathie Woods ETF’s continue to see inflows. XRT borrow is in high demand as GME’s weighting ballooned recently. However, large redemptions has caused borrow liquidity to completely dry up.

3966,GME," I think those media outlets are trying to manipulate boomers, their viewers, into buying silver. Boomers are already anxious with a Democrat as president. With a Democrat as president Fox is always hyping gold or some precious metal. So boomers are already predisposed to this play. But boomers probably have some FOMO on GME and want to get in on the “next” GME. The media has been mischaracterizing WSB to make them think the subreddit is a hive mind capable of moving prices like so. So they lined everything up to play some boomers.

3982,ALL," It's  kind of shocking to see peoples lack of critical thinking being able to  parse what Vlad tells us inadvertently in his interviews. First he says  stopping Selling of GME and the WSB stonks was voluntary, hes not  lying. He says there was no outside pressure from investment banks or  hedgefunds, he is probably not lying. He then says it was the doing of  clearing houses raising the required deposits which required larger  deposits from RH to continue trading, not that it was a liquidity  problem.

Here  he has outed himself the FIRST time as lying, it WAS in essence a  liquidity problem. HOWEVER, he continues - as a matter of trying to  salvage the face of RH that they did this to PROTECT THEIR CUSTOMERS. HE  IS NOT LYING, HOWEVER NOBODY IS CALLING HIM ON THE FACT THAT HIS  CUSTOMER IS IN FACT CITADEL TO THE TUNE OF 40% OF THEIR ANNUAL REVENUE.  RETAIL INVESTORS ARE HIS PRODUCT. LIE OF OMISSION. THATS #2.

Lie  #3 is the one that puzzles me the most WHY I HAVENT HEARD ANYONE CALL  THIS OUT. IF IT WAS A LIQUIDITY PROBLEM AS EVIDENCED BY THEM RUNNING TO  GET LINES OF CREDIT - HOW WAS ALL OTHER TRADING ABLE TO CONTINUE OF  WHICH THE TOTALS MUST EQUAL IN THE MILLIONS IF NOT BILLIONS IN TRADES  PER DAY? The answer is IT ACTUALLY WASNT A LIQUIDITY PROBLEM. Vlad says  as much, he says RH PROACTIVELY stopped buying BECAUSE they WOULD have  had to stop ALL TRADING if they didnt due to a lack of funds. So he's  caught lying, but not about the facts rather the details and REASONING.

LIE  #4 is the most insidious. Knowing all of this - Vlad made the decision  himself, knowing the CONSEQUENCES if he DIDNT. FURTHERMORE - THEY HAVE  CONTINUED TO LIMIT TRADING OF THESE STOCKS, WHICH AS WE KNOW THEY NOW  HAVE TONS OF CREDIT, SO IF ITS NOT A LIQUIDITY ISSUE NOW, WHAT IS IT? He  is going 4th level inception deep now, because they will claim AGAIN  they have to limit them because of the HIGH requirements of Clearing  houses, BUT WILL AGAIN CLAIM NO LIQUIDITY ISSUES. People are crazy  stupid these days to fall for this horse shit.

Had  Vlad not stopped the trading, it COULD have caused his platform to show  its inherent weakness which would have collapsed it. As it collapsed it  COULD have caused a cascading effect as his debtors (WSB) sought  compensation down the line.

HE  SELFISHLY MADE THE CALL TO SCREW PEOPLE OUT OF MILLIONS, TO SAVE HIS OWN  SKIN - AND THAT OF HIS OVERLORDS. One simply has to follow the logic of  what was said to its end conclusion to see the MANY contradictions.

3989,RH," It's  kind of shocking to see peoples lack of critical thinking being able to  parse what Vlad tells us inadvertently in his interviews. First he says  stopping Selling of GME and the WSB stonks was voluntary, hes not  lying. He says there was no outside pressure from investment banks or  hedgefunds, he is probably not lying. He then says it was the doing of  clearing houses raising the required deposits which required larger  deposits from RH to continue trading, not that it was a liquidity  problem.

Here  he has outed himself the FIRST time as lying, it WAS in essence a  liquidity problem. HOWEVER, he continues - as a matter of trying to  salvage the face of RH that they did this to PROTECT THEIR CUSTOMERS. HE  IS NOT LYING, HOWEVER NOBODY IS CALLING HIM ON THE FACT THAT HIS  CUSTOMER IS IN FACT CITADEL TO THE TUNE OF 40% OF THEIR ANNUAL REVENUE.  RETAIL INVESTORS ARE HIS PRODUCT. LIE OF OMISSION. THATS #2.

Lie  #3 is the one that puzzles me the most WHY I HAVENT HEARD ANYONE CALL  THIS OUT. IF IT WAS A LIQUIDITY PROBLEM AS EVIDENCED BY THEM RUNNING TO  GET LINES OF CREDIT - HOW WAS ALL OTHER TRADING ABLE TO CONTINUE OF  WHICH THE TOTALS MUST EQUAL IN THE MILLIONS IF NOT BILLIONS IN TRADES  PER DAY? The answer is IT ACTUALLY WASNT A LIQUIDITY PROBLEM. Vlad says  as much, he says RH PROACTIVELY stopped buying BECAUSE they WOULD have  had to stop ALL TRADING if they didnt due to a lack of funds. So he's  caught lying, but not about the facts rather the details and REASONING.

LIE  #4 is the most insidious. Knowing all of this - Vlad made the decision  himself, knowing the CONSEQUENCES if he DIDNT.

4000,GME," For anyone watching the GME situation (all of us?), consider these relevant points and taking the relevant actions:

1. Big money is MORTIFIED and the retaliation is completely unprecedented: coordinated attacks, willingness to risk prison over financial loss, concealing data, etc. They're shaking because we're holding GME. Despite any other lack of information available, this may be the best signal for why you should hold. Period.

2. After the massive GME rise, there was a LOT of bot activity trying to distract, dissuade, etc. They're poisoning the well, and it's difficult to know what can be trusted and what can't. The one thing we DEFINITELY know, however, is that all of those attacks are being done to make us sell GME and spin the narrative that the complicit agents are victims / good guys.

3. Robinhood + Citadel are trying to spin a BS narrative. If your institution can't afford something, shut everything down equally and go bankrupt. Choosing a specific stock to shut down is perhaps the most egregiously corrupt action ever taken in the market (which is saying A LOT). YOU weren't allowed to buy when major funds were, especially at CRITICAL times with CRITICAL buying opportunities to protect Citadel + big money and it collectively cost us tens of billions in lost opportunity. They're being sued, and rightfully so, but laws need to change to ruthlessly punish them NOW. Contact your representatives, SEC, etc. if you haven't already.

4. Hedges might lie about their short positions, or restrict visibility as much as possible. They can break laws and face negligible fees by comparison to the rest of what they stand to lose. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume they might do this among many other PR stunts to terrify you. Keep updated. Someone pointed out that iborrowdesk is no longer reporting on updated gme because, again, the legal consequences don't matter enough and they're protecting their interests. Refer to #1.

5. We don't know WHEN short positions will be covered, only the math that requires them to cover as we move forward. So if they delay and everyone gives in, they could save a lot of money. However, the longer they delay, the more they have to pay. So it's a matter of whether or not they double down and face higher risk/reward or not. Be prepared to WAIT.

6. If you set visible limits, the hedge funds can use this data to their advantage and potentially have attack vectors against us. However, if you don't set limits, you might miss out on major trading spikes when they happen. The selfless act is to avoid low limits, but the ultimate goal is to distribute wealth to the people so take if you're the people who need it.

7. If you're angry at Robinhood, move accounts AFTER this is over so that you're not frozen. Also, you'll be taxed on realized gains once you sell the stock. Weigh your risk tolerance on if you want to transfer the stocks or liquidate. Look into this further yourself, since I'm not a tax expert. 

8. If you're angry at Google for removing negative Robinhood accounts, use Ecosia instead. They're just as user friendly, effective, and they give 80% of their profits to green energy and planting trees. Google will lose hundreds or thousands of dollars per year from your ad revenue and data collection.

9. It's hard to anticipate what other stunts will be pulled to try to screw us over. Contact your representatives, particularly those in finance committees and demand REAL consequences for this criminal behavior. This matters.

15 minutes before close on Friday, a huge 3500 sell order for $245 was listed on the boards and was being laddered down to hit it to trigger any $250 stop losses and hunt for more on the way down.

AS THE SELL ORDER HIT THE BOARD... A 15,000 Buy order for $250 popped up like Gandalf at Helms Deep.

That buy order instantly chewed through every sell order in front of the $245 order, and the price shot to $315.

A second 8000 sell order for $285 was posted 1 minute before close, and a solid wall of fucking justice popped up with a 13,000 share buy order for $290 and a second 5000 buy order for $310.

4156,GME," 🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫To anyone worried about GME going down🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫

It's clearly the hedge funds selling off thier stock trying to create a frenzy of sell offs (just check the volume of trades)

But it's not working because we all keep buying the shares they're selling which is bringing the price back up

But obviously they are 1 organised entity, so they can plan their sell offs to make them seem like real people/multiple people are selling, but in reality it is clearly just a very very very small percentage of share holders actually selling(the hedgefunds)


Also the hedgefunds can't keep selling their stock or eventually they'll run out and be in an even shitter position when the shorts get squeezed


Expect a huge drop today(market manipulation)(followed by a huge recovery) and the huge drop will be their hail mary attempt when they try to scare people into selling, just don't fall for it and we'll crush them!

4232,CPA," I'm pretty sure someone did some accounting and put them pulling somewhere around $10-12m a year probably 2-3 years ago, which is pretty consistent with some other Youtubers like Stradman pulling in $2+ recently. Wouldn't be surprised given their push for new employees, they're closing in $20-25m+ now especially with those other channels and merch. 

My CPA does accounting for small media companies like these and says my business numbers and margins are nearly identical to what they see in like the larger influencing or social media companies (higher production ad companies). I don't know how taxes are in Canada, but I have 27 employees and just shy of $30m rev. Margins range 24-32%. Your recommended take home is usually around 30% of that for tax reasons and the rest should stay with the company, meaning your assets are tied to the company.    

Cheap or not, 50k isn't exactly chump change at his presumed personal income especially for someone whose personality tends to avoid financial risk. If he bought it under LTT Media Group, probably different story. I think the biggest difference between him and other YT like say MKBHD, is LTT far less of a one man show. 

Legitimately, LTT probably pulls in a ton of money, but unlike those other tech channels like say MKBHD and iJustine, etc, it really seem like his production cost is much higher than the rest of them, those channels are probably legit 70% margins.",WillTheGreat,31,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9ohx9/linus_buys_50k_of_shares/glkdcqe/,0.036,0.865,0.098,0.9156

>*”The volume is low”*. 

What does this mean? The total volume of shares being moved around is LOW. The dips you are seeing are artificial and are NOT due to people selling shares. It’s illegal market manipulation at its finest. 

Hedge funders sell their shares to each other at lower and lower bids (by tiny amounts) in rapid succession using bots. This tricks the algorithm into thinking a shit ton of shares are being dumped = the price is shown to go down.

In reality, no one is selling. Hedge funders are just moving shares between each other. If people were actually selling, you’d need at least 10x the volume to bring the price down like that.

Hedge funders sell their shares to each other at lower and lower bids (by tiny amounts) in rapid succession using bots. This tricks the algorithm into thinking a shit ton of shares are being dumped = the price is shown to go down.

In reality, no one is selling. Hedge funders are just moving shares between each other. If people were actually selling, you’d need at least 10x the volume to bring the price down like that.

Anyone who is here for a reason other than ""I think we control enough shares to trigger a short squeeze and set any sell price we want when that happens"" should absolutely get out and go trade any other random volatile stock. I'm here because I have done the DD to my satisfaction, and I think the squeeze is inevitable.

The reason we're frothing at the mouth for GME is not because someone shorted a lot of a stock.

# Its because hedge funds are counterfeiting shares. And its just as illegal as counterfeiting money

Say what?? They can do that? Apparently from my very limited DD, YES

That's how the share float got to 140% in the first place (as of Jan 31st -  Short interest is 75.54% of float according to Ortex, and 113.31% of float according to S3 Shortsight). The hedge funds, brokers, and clearing houses have been working together to create shares **which were never issued by the company**

That's what naked short selling is. You borrow a stock that doesn't even exist and then you **sell it as if it was a real share.** You might as well be printing money.

**This is how they can pull off infinite short-ladder attacks no matter how many shares are actually available to borrow from the brokers, because they can always fabricate more.** So if you're wondering how can the price go down if no one is selling? Its because they are creating shares to sell.

The **wake-up call** alluded to on Twitter by whales and political reps on our side is that GME has shoved this ugly truth into the light. The more people become financially literate and aware of this problem the more pressure the SEC will face to actually investigate this financial apocalypse institutions have created for themselves. **The reason us retards are holding is because it’s the only way to draw the public's attention to this 2008 level scam. The more we keep GME in the headlines the more people will find out the truth.**

The whales and political reps who support us are financially literate enough to understand this game is being played, but before the public wasn't financially literate enough to care. Now as more and more young investors educated by the internet get in on this and realize this is how they have been able to work prices in their favor destroying good companies in the process will DEMAND transparency from the clearing houses and the prime brokers.

The SEC maintains a Threshold Security list showing all of the ""fails-to-deliver"" with more than 1mil shares for a month. **This is the smoking gun that shows brokerages, hedge funds, and clearing houses have been counterfeiting shares aka naked shorting**

It's even worse than that. The financial institutions have many ways of preventing counterfeit shares from showing up as ""failed-to-deliver"" such as by keeping the transactions in-flight indefinitely. The actual number of shares that could be counterfeit could be as high as x20 or even more! The industry even has a nice professional sounding colloquialism ""strategic failed-to-deliver""

/u/Sleavitt10 gave a good TL;DR on why this is as earth shattering as the public gaining awareness on ""mortgage backed securities""

> The thing is this threatens to undermine the publics confidence in the entire system. **How do we know that the shares that we think we are purchasing are actually legit?** We could literally being paying good money for something that doesn't actually exist.

It's up to **you** to become financially literate on this topic and **understand** just how colossally fucked up this is. Until then you won't really understand what this movement is all about.

Hello guys,

Today something really bad happened to our europoors troops.  
Etoro, a quite famous broker here in Europe, decided to pull the most fucking disgusting move we had yet to see..

If you purchased today you had an AUTOMATIC AND UNREMOVABLE stoploss at -20%

I REPEAT, A FUCKING STOPLOSS AT 20% THAT YOU COULD NOT FUCKING MOVE AMID SHORT FUCKING ATTACKS.

Those who bought today totally got their money stolen, their arms fucking cut so that they couldnt diamond hand.

THIS IS FUCKING DISGUSTING AND THEY NEED TO BE PUNISHED.

EXPLANATION FOR WORRIED NEWBIE TRADERS 👇🏻

>*”The volume is low”*.

What does this mean? The total volume of shares being moved around is LOW. The dips you are seeing are artificial and are NOT due to people selling shares. It’s illegal market manipulation at its finest.

Hedge funders sell their shares to each other at lower and lower bids (by tiny amounts) in rapid succession using bots. This tricks the algorithm into thinking a shit ton of shares are being dumped = the price is shown to go down.

In reality, no one is selling. Hedge funders are just moving shares between each other. If people were actually selling, you’d need at least 10x the volume to bring the price down like that.

So, stop panicking pussies. They’ve been doing this all week. Stop staring at your screen and watching every dollar movement. Go for a walk without a phone, have a shower, damn have breakfast if you haven’t already.

4478,MSM," If this were a bubble, a pump and dump like the MSM are trying to say, and it had burst/lost it's hype/whatever - then the price right now would be about $30.

It's well over $200 - so clearly we are nowhere near the end of this, despite all of their dirty tricks, the media, their enormous funds, the shorting, more shorting, ladders, and the rest...

they STILL can't crash it - because they simply can't buy the share to close the shorts.

Eventually their bubble will burst, and when it does the price is going to Ganymede.

IMHO - not financial advice etc.

Just common sense with the fear taken out of it.

What does this mean? The total volume of shares being moved around is LOW. The dips you are seeing are artificial and are NOT due to people selling shares. It’s illegal market manipulation at its finest.

Hedge funders sell their shares to each other at lower and lower bids (by tiny amounts) in rapid succession using bots. This tricks the algorithm into thinking a shit ton of shares are being dumped = the price is shown to go down.

In reality, no one is selling. Hedge funders are just moving shares between each other. If people were actually selling, you’d need at least 10x the volume to bring the price down like that.

Gentlemen, I'm new here but I'm a mathematician at heart (I'm a big fan of my username, google it) and didn't had much time at my disposal to spend on reddit


Their strategy is this: They want us to believe they are out when in fact THEY ARE NOT. We have them by the balls. They want us to believe the war is over so that we leave and tank the stock price down. 


That's why Friday was not that much of a brutal day, to make it seem they have no reason to stir up waters because they are out, that they left. Late Thursday they have LIED they are out. (using places like cnbc and not an official press release that would have them liable). This is their narrative, they try anything to make you give up.


When we give up (NEVER!) is when they will make money, DO NOT GIVE THEM YOUR MONEY, STAY HERE, that's the reason they keep shorting or ""doubling down"" because they believe we will go home and they also want to make it seem like the virality of the movement is over which is not true, it's just getting started.


They think we are cowards, thugs, scared weak sheep, gulible. WHICH WE ARE NOT. And that's how we will further be painted if you give up and go home. DON'T GO HOME. THIS IS YOUR NEW HOME. 


I believe everyone one of you, as you have demonstrated everyday and especially Thursday, is here to stay and make these evil psychopaths PAY and PAY BIG, Remember this is our mission, not to make a few bucks but that we LOVE THE STOCK. We HOLD for as long as we need. As you've seen DeepFuckingValue is DIAMOND BALLS DEEP IN.

Desperately they tried to make some money Thursday and succeeded by using evil and illegal tactics, by doubling down on the short then closing robinhood and tanking the market. They make money when the stock goes down BUT IT WILL NOT GO DOWN BECAUSE WE HOLD.


But if WE HOLD then it won't go down and THEY WILL PAY EVERY SINGLE DAY. As long as we HOLD then it's costing them big money every single day then the stock price is high and they have to pay those stocks that they shorted.  STAY FOCUSED ON THE MISSION.

Their strategy is this: They want us to believe they are out when in fact THEY ARE NOT. We have them by the balls. They want us to believe the war is over so that we leave and tank the stock price down. 


That's why Friday was not that much of a brutal day, to make it seem they have no reason to stir up waters because they are out, that they left. Late Thursday they have LIED they are out. (using places like cnbc and not an official press release that would have them liable). This is their narrative, they try anything to make you give up.


When we give up (NEVER!) is when they will make money, DO NOT GIVE THEM YOUR MONEY, STAY HERE, that's the reason they keep shorting or ""doubling down"" because they believe we will go home and they also want to make it seem like the virality of the movement is over which is not true, it's just getting started.


They think we are cowards, thugs, scared weak sheep, gulible. WHICH WE ARE NOT. And that's how we will further be painted if you give up and go home. DON'T GO HOME. THIS IS YOUR NEW HOME. 


I believe everyone one of you, as you have demonstrated everyday and especially Thursday, is here to stay and make these evil psychopaths PAY and PAY BIG, Remember this is our mission, not to make a few bucks but that we LOVE THE STOCK. We HOLD for as long as we need. As you've seen DeepFuckingValue is DIAMOND BALLS DEEP IN. 


BECAUSE WE ARE IN LOVE WITH THE STOCK. 


Desperately they tried to make some money Thursday and succeeded by using evil and illegal tactics, by doubling down on the short then closing robinhood and tanking the market. They make money when the stock goes down BUT IT WILL NOT GO DOWN BECAUSE WE HOLD.


But if WE HOLD then it won't go down and THEY WILL PAY EVERY SINGLE DAY. As long as we HOLD then it's costing them big money every single day then the stock price is high and they have to pay those stocks that they shorted.  STAY FOCUSED ON THE MISSION.

>*”The volume is low”*.

What does this mean? The total volume of shares being moved around is LOW. The dips you are seeing are artificial and are NOT due to people selling shares. It’s illegal market manipulation at its finest.

Hedge funders sell their shares to each other at lower and lower bids (by tiny amounts) in rapid succession using bots. This tricks the algorithm into thinking a shit ton of shares are being dumped = the price is shown to go down.

In reality, no one is selling. Hedge funders are just moving shares between each other. If people were actually selling, you’d need at least 10x the volume to bring the price down like that.

Every time you sell, the hedgie scrapes 0.xx% back.

It's going to take them a fucking long time to get it somewhere they're happy with, but the best thing you can do is

It's clearly the hedge funds selling off thier stock trying to create a frenzy of sell offs (just check the volume of trades)

But it's not working because we all keep buying the shares they're selling which is bringing the price back up

But obviously they are 1 organised entity, so they can plan their sell offs to make them seem like real people/multiple people are selling, but in reality it is clearly just a very very very small percentage of share holders actually selling(the hedgefunds)

Also the hedgefunds can't keep selling their stock or eventually they'll run out and be in an even shitter position when the shorts get squeezed

Expect a huge drop today(market manipulation)(followed by a huge recovery) and the huge drop will be their hail mary attempt when they try to scare people into selling, just don't fall for it and we'll crush them!

”The volume is low”.

What does this mean? The total volume of shares being moved around is LOW. The dips you are seeing are artificial and are NOT due to people selling shares. It’s illegal market manipulation at its finest.

Hedge funders sell their shares to each other at lower and lower bids (by tiny amounts) in rapid succession using bots. This tricks the algorithm into thinking a shit ton of shares are being dumped = the price is shown to go down.

In reality, no one is selling. Hedge funders are just moving shares between each other. If people were actually selling, you’d need at least 10x the volume to bring the price down like that.

The Reason We can't just Buy Back In.

The Meme: Buy, Hold, Never sell.

Why do we have to Diamond Hand so hard right now? Can't we just buy dips to increase our holdings?

NO. ABSOLUTELY NOT.

Because we control the stocks. THEY control the shorts. Sure, you CAN buy back at a dip, but this is 2 steps forward and countless steps back.

Imagine: a trader shorts his GME out expecting GameStop to go under. He gets his money, the stock is loaned, and he doesn't pay a cent. Now: imagine this second trader shorts this stock. This share is officially over-shorted. Repeat this 3, 4, 5, a gorillion times, it doesn't matter. At the end of the day, it's only one share taken hostage.

If you sell a single share, that entire line of overshorts vanishes as they just loan back the stock up the chain at a loss. We can't make them short after we buy back in.

THAT is why we can't just sell and buy back the dips. If we sell, the dips will become a permanent crash. WE control the stocks. THEY control the shorts.

If WE give them the power to eradicate their short chains, they win. If WE DON'T give them the power to eradicate their chains, they will end up insolvent and we win. Exponential gains down the road. Debt + (Debt*Interest) = OUR GAINS.

THAT IS WHY YOU CAN'T SELL. IF YOU SELL, WE ALL LOSE. IF YOU HOLD, WE ALL WIN.

>*”The volume is low”*.

What does this mean? The total volume of shares being moved around is LOW. The dips you are seeing are artificial and are NOT due to people selling shares. It’s illegal market manipulation at its finest.

Hedge funders sell their shares to each other at lower and lower bids (by tiny amounts) in rapid succession using bots. This tricks the algorithm into thinking a shit ton of shares are being dumped = the price is shown to go down.

In reality, no one is selling. Hedge funders are just moving shares between each other. If people were actually selling, you’d need at least 10x the volume to bring the price down like that.

So, stop panicking pussies. They’ve been doing this all week. Stop staring at your screen and watching every dollar movement.

4616,SI," Isn't it mathematically impossible for Short-Interest to be below 100%? Check my math below:

What is the actual float?

Guru Focus says:
Float = 27.29 MI
Outstanding = 69.75 MI
Float % Outstanding = 39.12%
Insider Ownership = 13.58% (could be even higher, conservative) =  9.47 MI
Institutional Ownership = 64.44% = 44.95 MI

S3 says:
27mm shares short, 53% SI

Ortex says:
29.4mm shares short, 58.21% SI

But, if the float is 27.29 MI, that would mean that the SI as % of Float is <100% no matter what shares short (ortex or S3 figure you use. Not to mention S3 has been compromised).

They say they’re using synthetic longs, but those aren’t real shares? What is going on here? *The SI as a % of float should still be close to 100% no matter what.*

How can the SI be below 100% if even at S3's new fake figure, they're still short 100% of the float?

4666,ALL," When exiting the vehicle, remember these things to be able to take all your baggage with you.

Some of the paper hands among us may be planning to exit this rocket ship early. To those on their first ride please keep the following in mind. This will serve as your parachute to ensure a safe landing as you disappoint the 💎🙌 taking the ride to the moon.

ALL your profit will be taxed the same as normal income if you’ve not held it for at least a year and a day. And your brokerage is not your employer and does not withhold the tax for you. Don’t spend it all on that fancy chicken dinner yet. Tax day comes, and you can't hide from it.

0. Open a new high interest savings account somewhere. You want it to be somewhere you can forget about until April 2022 and not be tempted to dip into if you are low on self control like me. Use it for numbers 1 and 2 below.

1. Set aside 37% of your profit for your dear old Uncle Sam. You’ll probably not have to pay that much, but he hates it if you’re short. He’ll find a way to get what’s his, and he’ll make you pay more if he has to come after it (penalties, fines, interest, garnishment). Google tax brackets and figure out where you’ll slot in. Hopefully you made enough to fall in that top bracket. And if you do, don’t whine about how much tax you have to pay. See number 5 and work with them to find ways to reduce your bill. You’ll have plenty left over for those tendies.
2. Don’t forget about your state taxes either. Google your state tax brackets and set that aside too.
3. Charitable giving can be a deduction if you want to share your largess and feel good about spreading the good times around. You’ve done your part to crush the hedge fund, now go and be the Robinhood.
4. Treat yourself and those you love, but keep enough powder dry for the next battle.
5. Find a good accountant and ask about taxes on large stock gains. Now might be the year to pay for someone to do your taxes for you if you’ve been a do it yourselfer with TurboTax or something. The couple hundred for the service is a cheap way to ensure you keep what’s yours and not over pay in taxes. This is what they do. They love doing taxes, give them what they love doing. You don't see rich ass people doing their own taxes, there's a very good reason for this. Don’t be cheap here, they can often find ways to save multiples of their fee in deductions and other writeoffs you’ve never thought of.
6. Fully fund your 401(k) if you have one (2021 max is $19,500) and max out your IRA (2021 max is $6000). You can still make contributions to Roth and traditional IRA for tax year 2020 until April 2021.

4727,RH," IMHO the pitchfork is a bit premature. If S3 reviewed the data and it is off, I’d want them to correct it. If the shorts are being covered either through buys or calls it will still cause a squeeze.

This may also explain why bunch of RH ITM calls got prematurely redeemed, esp at the bottom of the dip near end of day. I bet Citadel forced call redemption and did a sleight of hand. It cost them the same, but instead of us getting the shares they got it and sent the cash to RH instead.

4734,TSLA," S3's methodology seems to be very inadequate based on my looking at TSLA short interest for several months last year (and specifically S3's claims on a given day, versus NASDAQ's reports after that day).

Based on what I was seeing in price action versus short interest in TSLA, and some things in a report about the Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac collapses that someone on this sub linked, I think S3's deriving short interest data from the *legal* shorting activity, and doesn't see the transactions making up the illegal activity at all. So, when illegal stuff happens, S3 is just wrong.

Also, Ihor tends to downplay the hypotheses that illegal shorting is happening, for two reasons: #1, *he* isn't seeing it because it's not happening in a way that S3 sees, and #2, I have a suspicion that legal shorts are probably the main buyers of S3's analysis (because they don't want to accidentally corner themselves like the shorts did on GME), and talking about illegal shorting would be bad for business.",bhtooefr,7,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9pcaa/todays_s3_data_update_smells_fishy/gljtq1d/,0.156,0.765,0.078,-0.943

4739,GME," If you feel like selling, read this instead.

Infinite money. You sit on the toilet and check Robinhood, when you notice GME squeezing uncontrollably. After ten green bars you start to worry. “Diamond Hands” you tell yourself, but your getting anxious. You try not to look at the rising price, and consider locking your phone, but that only makes your stomach ache. The short squeeze accelerates. It’s been three minutes. Money begins to physically pour out of your phone. Your bathroom floor is covered in a thin layer of $100 bills. You try to shovel it into the tub but it builds up too fast. You lock the bathroom door to prevent the cash from escaping. The air grows thin, rapidly displaced by the impossible flow of cash. The short squeeze accelerates. You slip and fall in the anomalous stream of bills, pouring from your phone. The cash is now six inches deep, and you struggle to put down your phone, but alas, you hands have solidified into perfect diamonds. The short squeeze accelerates. You struggle to stand as the force of the cash rapidly exiting your phone, stuck in your hand and impossible to put down, begins to propel you backwards as if you were on a money printer themed slip-and-slide. Still on your knees, the cash is now at chin height. To avoid drowning you open the bathroom door. The deluge of greenbacks reminds you of the Great Molasses Flood of 1919, only with money instead of molasses. The short squeeze accelerates. It’s been ten minutes. Your children and wife scream in rapture as their bodies are engulfed by the freshly minted freedom bucks. Your youngest child goes under, with equal parts delight and horror, and muffled cries rising from the churning cash pool. You pray to DeepFuckingValue to finally sell, so you can follow suit. The short squeeze accelerates. You squeeze your eyes shut to stop the eldritch sight of so much money pouring from your phone, but it does not care if you witness it. It can not be contained. The force of the money propels you with such force you feel a sense of weightlessness as you accelerate off the ground. Your body picks up speed as it slides backwards along the uncrumpled bills. You smash through the wall, hurtling into the sky at thirty miles an hour. From a bird’s eye view you see your house is completely buried in money. Your neighbor calls the SEC. The short squeeze accelerates. As you continue to ascend, you spot police cars racing towards your house. The cops pull out their guns and take aim, but stray bundles of money hit them in the eyes, blinding them. The short squeeze accelerates. You are now at an altitude of 1000 feet. The SWAT team arrives. Military helicopters circle you. The billionaire class has ordered your execution, and hundreds of guns fire on you, yet you remain unharmed, being forged from diamonds. The short squeeze accelerates. It has been two hours. With your ape-like body now entirely composed of Diamond, the money begins to spray as if directed by a rocket nozzle. You break the sound barrier. The government, pressured by WallStreet, deploys fighter jets to chase you down, but the impact of your cash flow sends one plane crashing to the ground. The government decides to let you leave the Earth. You feel your lungs start to burn, as you reach the edges of the atmosphere. You narrowly miss the ISS, giving it a new green paint job as you fly past. Physicists and economists struggle to calculate your erratic trajectory. The short squeeze accelerates. The money begins to gravitate towards itself, forming a comet trail of cash. Astronomers begin calling you the “GME Rocket.” You are lost in space, heading roughly in the direction of Andromeda. You wonder, briefly, if perhaps you should hit the Sell button. A small voice in the back of your shattered mind whispers...

During recession after recession I was born and raised

Seeing hedge fund make billions with crooked plays

Browsing memes and shitposting on the internets

When I stumble across fellow retards on WallStreetBets

A few million autists who were up to some good

Started making trouble on Robinhood

GME shot up and the hedge funds got scared

They said 'You're stealing from the wealthy and that ain't fair""",GreenFrog42069,407,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la3ajh/give_them_nothing_but_take_from_them_everything/gllk5zk/,0.177,0.736,0.087,-0.885

**This is what the shorts are doing right now.**

**Dont feel like reading a novel? The short and dirty (TLDR AT THE FUCKING BOTTOM):**

 
Short Attack:

1. Sell **fake**, COUNTERFEIT stocks between hedge funds and increasingly lower ask prices to try to scare other investors into selling and/or to trigger limit sell price points. They've been doing this all week. Each major price drop has been because of this tactic.


2. Get the media to spread fear, doubt, and uncertainty. Anyone watching CNBC this week has seen this in action.


3. Spread disinformation through ""analysis"" to get people to sell their stocks because ""the fundamentals aren't there"". Again, this is all over the place right now.


4. Open class action lawsuits against the company/shareholders claiming they're artificially inflating the stock price. Haven't seen it yet, but they've definitely threatened it.


5. Get the government/SEC involved alleging the same as #4. Definitely happening.


6. Pull margin shares and sell them. As seen being done by Robinhood over the last two days.


7. Spread FUD on message boards. Hello 4 million new subs pushing AMC, BB, SLV, etc.

Basically this past week has been 9/10 of the tactics in the short attack playbook to try to either push Gamestop into bankruptcy so they can profit on their short positions or slowly gain them back when people sell their stocks.

* Jim Cramer, in a video-taped interview with The Street.com, best described the media function:

When (shorting) ... The hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful, because the truth is so against your view, (so the hedge funds) create a new 'truth' that is development of the fiction... you hit the brokerage houses with a series of orders (a short down ladder that pushes the price down), then we go to the press. You have a vicious cycle down - it's a pretty good game.*

**Yet more support for the at times illegal and unethical nature of these practices: (THANK YOU, /u/catolicquotes**

**Pulling Margin** from long customers during a short attack serves two purposes. Obviously the flood of shares that are “forced” sales help drive the price down, which aids the short cause in general. More important, for the broker dealers who clear for their retail customers at the same time they short against them, it creates a built-in source of cheap shares from which they can cover their open short positions.

Some of the **broker dealers short against their retail customers** from their proprietary trading desks, or “prop” desks. These are trades owned by the broker dealer, and, while they are not illegal, ethical questions certainly exist. The retail customers, who may be purchasing long investments that are being pushed by the broker dealer's retail network, have no inkling that the broker is taking a large short position contrary to the retail investor's position. With the encouragement of easy margin credit, i.e. 30% equity, the retail customers load up on stock and margin debt.

**The broker dealer, in concert with other shorts, may crash the stock by flooding the board with counterfeit shares, dropping the stock price**. The broker dealers know the amount of margin debt and the price at which their retail customers get into margin trouble. They can accelerate the squeeze on their retail customers by arbitrarily increasing the equity (percentage) requirement as the price is dropping, **frequently citing “volatility”**; which is really the shorts flooding the board with counterfeit shares.

The compounding effect of a dropping price and increasing equity requirement flushes out more shares. The broker dealers sometimes will take over the account during a margin sell-off. By engaging in poor trading practices, such as heavy selling over lunch hour; concentrated “dumps” of shares; hitting the bid with market orders; and conspiring with other trading desks, **they can further plummet the value of the stock and maximize the shares they have stripped from their retail customers**.

Most of the broker dealers who have both retail customers and prop-desk trading appear to engage in these practices. Goldman, Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch have been named in suits alleging these practices. Goldman made billions shorting against the subprime mortgage industry at the same time they were selling subprime investments to their customers.

**Pulling Margin** from long customers during a short attack serves two purposes. Obviously the flood of shares that are “forced” sales help drive the price down, which aids the short cause in general. More important, for the broker dealers who clear for their retail customers at the same time they short against them, it creates a built-in source of cheap shares from which they can cover their open short positions.

Some of the **broker dealers short against their retail customers** from their proprietary trading desks, or “prop” desks. These are trades owned by the broker dealer, and, while they are not illegal, ethical questions certainly exist. The retail customers, who may be purchasing long investments that are being pushed by the broker dealer's retail network, have no inkling that the broker is taking a large short position contrary to the retail investor's position. With the encouragement of easy margin credit, i.e. 30% equity, the retail customers load up on stock and margin debt.

**The broker dealer, in concert with other shorts, may crash the stock by flooding the board with counterfeit shares, dropping the stock price**. The broker dealers know the amount of margin debt and the price at which their retail customers get into margin trouble. They can accelerate the squeeze on their retail customers by arbitrarily increasing the equity (percentage) requirement as the price is dropping, **frequently citing “volatility”**; which is really the shorts flooding the board with counterfeit shares.

The compounding effect of a dropping price and increasing equity requirement flushes out more shares. The broker dealers sometimes will take over the account during a margin sell-off. By engaging in poor trading practices, such as heavy selling over lunch hour; concentrated “dumps” of shares; hitting the bid with market orders; and conspiring with other trading desks, **they can further plummet the value of the stock and maximize the shares they have stripped from their retail customers**.

Most of the broker dealers who have both retail customers and prop-desk trading appear to engage in these practices. Goldman, Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch have been named in suits alleging these practices. Goldman made billions shorting against the subprime mortgage industry at the same time they were selling subprime investments to their customers.

Check out real time transactions here: https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/latest-real-time-trades

See all the ""perfect"" orders (e.g. 100, 200, 300 shares) of nice whole numbers in the hundreds, with scattered ""imperfect orders""  (e.g. 134, 194 shares)? Notice how the nice, whole numbered orders are very predictable in pricing which varies cents off of one another? 

It's a coordinated attack. Hold and chill. This isn't financial advice, just sharing something new.

**This is what the shorts are doing right now.**

**Dont feel like reading a novel? The short and dirty (TLDR AT THE FUCKING BOTTOM):**

 
Short Attack:

1. Sell **fake**, COUNTERFEIT stocks between hedge funds and increasingly lower ask prices to try to scare other investors into selling and/or to trigger limit sell price points. They've been doing this all week. Each major price drop has been because of this tactic.


2. Get the media to spread fear, doubt, and uncertainty. Anyone watching CNBC this week has seen this in action.


3. Spread disinformation through ""analysis"" to get people to sell their stocks because ""the fundamentals aren't there"". Again, this is all over the place right now.


4. Open class action lawsuits against the company/shareholders claiming they're artificially inflating the stock price. Haven't seen it yet, but they've definitely threatened it.


5. Get the government/SEC involved alleging the same as #4. Definitely happening.


6. Pull margin shares and sell them. As seen being done by Robinhood over the last two days.


7. Spread FUD on message boards. Hello 4 million new subs pushing AMC, BB, SLV, etc.

Basically this past week has been 9/10 of the tactics in the short attack playbook to try to either push Gamestop into bankruptcy so they can profit on their short positions or slowly gain them back when people sell their stocks.

Confused what **counterfeited stock** means? Some light reading that /u/draemon_   provided explains it perfectly but beware, you actually have to read something:

**Need more proof?**

Jim Cramer himself, 
[""here's what short sellers do, it's illegal but when you have 6 days to get out and you're down you need to foment and wipe that guy out quickly"".](https://youtu.be/VMuEis3byY4)

**This interview, which is more like a confession, was never supposed to get on the air; however, it somehow ended up on YouTube. Cramer and The Street.com have made repeated efforts, with some success, to get it taken off of YouTube. (THANKS for this info, /u/blancochocolate)**

* Jim Cramer, in a video-taped interview with The Street.com, best described the media function:

When (shorting) ... The hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful, because the truth is so against your view, (so the hedge funds) create a new 'truth' that is development of the fiction... you hit the brokerage houses with a series of orders (a short down ladder that pushes the price down), then we go to the press. You have a vicious cycle down - it's a pretty good game.*

They all collectively over-shorted GME to both benefit from GameStop going bankrupt and to influence the stock into bankruptcy themselves.

Most overshorts prior were for companies on life support, but GameStop was actually doing just fine this whole time. DeepFuckingValue and co called wall street on their bluff, and that's why they're panicking.

A short has a potential for Infinite losses if the price goes up. Do your own Due Diligence and you'll understand why this is a once in a lifetime Infinite Short Squeeze scenario.

You might get a chance though, if the bullion dealers try to make the price go down by claiming they don't have any. Like with whatever you guys are doing with GME (idk what exactly that is cause I started up my account after years of inactivity just to talk about this stuff, because some of us have known about the silver short for fucking ages and have been waiting for it to start breaking out, not because we're shills. it's literally the opposite.) you have to buy and hold all the physical off the market.

**This is what the shorts are doing right now.**

**Dont feel like reading a novel? The short and dirty (TLDR AT THE FUCKING BOTTOM):**

 
Short Attack:

1. Sell **fake**, COUNTERFEIT stocks between hedge funds and increasingly lower ask prices to try to scare other investors into selling and/or to trigger limit sell price points. They've been doing this all week. Each major price drop has been because of this tactic.


2. Get the media to spread fear, doubt, and uncertainty. Anyone watching CNBC this week has seen this in action.


3. Spread disinformation through ""analysis"" to get people to sell their stocks because ""the fundamentals aren't there"". Again, this is all over the place right now.


4. Open class action lawsuits against the company/shareholders claiming they're artificially inflating the stock price. Haven't seen it yet, but they've definitely threatened it.


5. Get the government/SEC involved alleging the same as #4. Definitely happening.


6. Pull margin shares and sell them. As seen being done by Robinhood over the last two days.


7. Spread FUD on message boards. Hello 4 million new subs pushing AMC, BB, SLV, etc.

Basically this past week has been 9/10 of the tactics in the short attack playbook to try to either push Gamestop into bankruptcy so they can profit on their short positions or slowly gain them back when people sell their stocks.

Confused what **counterfeited stock** means? Some light reading that /u/draemon_   provided explains it perfectly but beware, you actually have to read something:

* Jim Cramer, in a video-taped interview with The Street.com, best described the media function:

When (shorting) ... The hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful, because the truth is so against your view, (so the hedge funds) create a new 'truth' that is development of the fiction... you hit the brokerage houses with a series of orders (a short down ladder that pushes the price down), then we go to the press. You have a vicious cycle down - it's a pretty good game.*

**Yet more support for the at times illegal and unethical nature of these practices: (THANK YOU, /u/catolicquotes**

**Pulling Margin** from long customers during a short attack serves two purposes. Obviously the flood of shares that are “forced” sales help drive the price down, which aids the short cause in general. More important, for the broker dealers who clear for their retail customers at the same time they short against them, it creates a built-in source of cheap shares from which they can cover their open short positions.

Some of the **broker dealers short against their retail customers** from their proprietary trading desks, or “prop” desks. These are trades owned by the broker dealer, and, while they are not illegal, ethical questions certainly exist. The retail customers, who may be purchasing long investments that are being pushed by the broker dealer's retail network, have no inkling that the broker is taking a large short position contrary to the retail investor's position. With the encouragement of easy margin credit, i.e. 30% equity, the retail customers load up on stock and margin debt.

**The broker dealer, in concert with other shorts, may crash the stock by flooding the board with counterfeit shares, dropping the stock price**. The broker dealers know the amount of margin debt and the price at which their retail customers get into margin trouble. They can accelerate the squeeze on their retail customers by arbitrarily increasing the equity (percentage) requirement as the price is dropping, **frequently citing “volatility”**; which is really the shorts flooding the board with counterfeit shares.

The compounding effect of a dropping price and increasing equity requirement flushes out more shares. The broker dealers sometimes will take over the account during a margin sell-off. By engaging in poor trading practices, such as heavy selling over lunch hour; concentrated “dumps” of shares; hitting the bid with market orders; and conspiring with other trading desks, **they can further plummet the value of the stock and maximize the shares they have stripped from their retail customers**.

Most of the broker dealers who have both retail customers and prop-desk trading appear to engage in these practices. Goldman, Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch have been named in suits alleging these practices. Goldman made billions shorting against the subprime mortgage industry at the same time they were selling subprime investments to their customers.

They have a better shot of making a movie that's basically a collection of 90 minutes of memes. Of course, the licensing to replay all the source content will be so massive, it will bankrupt Hollywood.

**This is what the shorts are doing right now.**

**Dont feel like reading a novel? The short and dirty (TLDR AT THE FUCKING BOTTOM):**

 
Short Attack:

1. Sell **fake**, COUNTERFEIT stocks between hedge funds and increasingly lower ask prices to try to scare other investors into selling and/or to trigger limit sell price points. They've been doing this all week. Each major price drop has been because of this tactic.


2. Get the media to spread fear, doubt, and uncertainty. Anyone watching CNBC this week has seen this in action.


3. Spread disinformation through ""analysis"" to get people to sell their stocks because ""the fundamentals aren't there"". Again, this is all over the place right now.


4. Open class action lawsuits against the company/shareholders claiming they're artificially inflating the stock price. Haven't seen it yet, but they've definitely threatened it.


5. Get the government/SEC involved alleging the same as #4. Definitely happening.


6. Pull margin shares and sell them. As seen being done by Robinhood over the last two days.


7. Spread FUD on message boards. Hello 4 million new subs pushing AMC, BB, SLV, etc.

Basically this past week has been 9/10 of the tactics in the short attack playbook to try to either push Gamestop into bankruptcy so they can profit on their short positions or slowly gain them back when people sell their stocks.

Confused what **counterfeited stock** means? Some light reading that /u/draemon_   provided explains it perfectly but beware, you actually have to read something:

* Jim Cramer, in a video-taped interview with The Street.com, best described the media function:

When (shorting) ... The hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful, because the truth is so against your view, (so the hedge funds) create a new 'truth' that is development of the fiction... you hit the brokerage houses with a series of orders (a short down ladder that pushes the price down), then we go to the press. You have a vicious cycle down - it's a pretty good game.*

**Yet more support for the at times illegal and unethical nature of these practices: (THANK YOU, /u/catolicquotes**

**Pulling Margin** from long customers during a short attack serves two purposes. Obviously the flood of shares that are “forced” sales help drive the price down, which aids the short cause in general. More important, for the broker dealers who clear for their retail customers at the same time they short against them, it creates a built-in source of cheap shares from which they can cover their open short positions.

Some of the **broker dealers short against their retail customers** from their proprietary trading desks, or “prop” desks. These are trades owned by the broker dealer, and, while they are not illegal, ethical questions certainly exist. The retail customers, who may be purchasing long investments that are being pushed by the broker dealer's retail network, have no inkling that the broker is taking a large short position contrary to the retail investor's position. With the encouragement of easy margin credit, i.e. 30% equity, the retail customers load up on stock and margin debt.

**The broker dealer, in concert with other shorts, may crash the stock by flooding the board with counterfeit shares, dropping the stock price**. The broker dealers know the amount of margin debt and the price at which their retail customers get into margin trouble. They can accelerate the squeeze on their retail customers by arbitrarily increasing the equity (percentage) requirement as the price is dropping, **frequently citing “volatility”**; which is really the shorts flooding the board with counterfeit shares.

The compounding effect of a dropping price and increasing equity requirement flushes out more shares. The broker dealers sometimes will take over the account during a margin sell-off. By engaging in poor trading practices, such as heavy selling over lunch hour; concentrated “dumps” of shares; hitting the bid with market orders; and conspiring with other trading desks, **they can further plummet the value of the stock and maximize the shares they have stripped from their retail customers**.

Most of the broker dealers who have both retail customers and prop-desk trading appear to engage in these practices. Goldman, Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch have been named in suits alleging these practices. Goldman made billions shorting against the subprime mortgage industry at the same time they were selling subprime investments to their customers.

* Jim Cramer, in a video-taped interview with The Street.com, best described the media function:

When (shorting) ... The hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful, because the truth is so against your view, (so the hedge funds) create a new 'truth' that is development of the fiction... you hit the brokerage houses with a series of orders (a short down ladder that pushes the price down), then we go to the press. You have a vicious cycle down - it's a pretty good game.*

**Yet more support for the at times illegal and unethical nature of these practices: (THANK YOU, /u/catolicquotes**

**Pulling Margin** from long customers during a short attack serves two purposes. Obviously the flood of shares that are “forced” sales help drive the price down, which aids the short cause in general. More important, for the broker dealers who clear for their retail customers at the same time they short against them, it creates a built-in source of cheap shares from which they can cover their open short positions.

Some of the **broker dealers short against their retail customers** from their proprietary trading desks, or “prop” desks. These are trades owned by the broker dealer, and, while they are not illegal, ethical questions certainly exist. The retail customers, who may be purchasing long investments that are being pushed by the broker dealer's retail network, have no inkling that the broker is taking a large short position contrary to the retail investor's position. With the encouragement of easy margin credit, i.e. 30% equity, the retail customers load up on stock and margin debt.

**The broker dealer, in concert with other shorts, may crash the stock by flooding the board with counterfeit shares, dropping the stock price**. The broker dealers know the amount of margin debt and the price at which their retail customers get into margin trouble. They can accelerate the squeeze on their retail customers by arbitrarily increasing the equity (percentage) requirement as the price is dropping, **frequently citing “volatility”**; which is really the shorts flooding the board with counterfeit shares.

The compounding effect of a dropping price and increasing equity requirement flushes out more shares. The broker dealers sometimes will take over the account during a margin sell-off. By engaging in poor trading practices, such as heavy selling over lunch hour; concentrated “dumps” of shares; hitting the bid with market orders; and conspiring with other trading desks, **they can further plummet the value of the stock and maximize the shares they have stripped from their retail customers**.

Most of the broker dealers who have both retail customers and prop-desk trading appear to engage in these practices. Goldman, Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch have been named in suits alleging these practices. Goldman made billions shorting against the subprime mortgage industry at the same time they were selling subprime investments to their customers.

Check out real time transactions here: https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/latest-real-time-trades

See all the ""perfect"" orders (e.g. 100, 200, 300 shares) of nice whole numbers in the hundreds, with scattered ""imperfect orders""  (e.g. 134, 194 shares)? Notice how the nice, whole numbered orders are very predictable in pricing which varies cents off of one another? 

It's a coordinated attack. Hold and chill. This isn't financial advice, just sharing something new.

 **Before you decide to sell your stonks at a loss because you got 📃  👐 , or if you're doubting the great DD that some of the folks on this side of history have done, HAVE A READ:**

**This is what the shorts are doing right now.**

**Dont feel like reading a novel? The short and dirty (TLDR AT THE FUCKING BOTTOM):**

 
Short Attack:

1. Sell **fake**, COUNTERFEIT stocks between hedge funds and increasingly lower ask prices to try to scare other investors into selling and/or to trigger limit sell price points. They've been doing this all week. Each major price drop has been because of this tactic.


2. Get the media to spread fear, doubt, and uncertainty. Anyone watching CNBC this week has seen this in action.


3. Spread disinformation through ""analysis"" to get people to sell their stocks because ""the fundamentals aren't there"". Again, this is all over the place right now.


4. Open class action lawsuits against the company/shareholders claiming they're artificially inflating the stock price. Haven't seen it yet, but they've definitely threatened it.


5. Get the government/SEC involved alleging the same as #4. Definitely happening.


6. Pull margin shares and sell them. As seen being done by Robinhood over the last two days.


7. Spread FUD on message boards. Hello 4 million new subs pushing AMC, BB, SLV, etc.

Basically this past week has been 9/10 of the tactics in the short attack playbook to try to either push Gamestop into bankruptcy so they can profit on their short positions or slowly gain them back when people sell their stocks.

Confused what **counterfeited stock** means? Some light reading that /u/draemon_   provided explains it perfectly but beware, you actually have to read something:

**This is what the shorts are doing right now.**

**Dont feel like reading a novel? The short and dirty (TLDR AT THE FUCKING BOTTOM):**

Short Attack:

1. Sell **fake**, COUNTERFEIT stocks between hedge funds and increasingly lower ask prices to try to scare other investors into selling and/or to trigger limit sell price points. They've been doing this all week. Each major price drop has been because of this tactic.
2. Get the media to spread fear, doubt, and uncertainty. Anyone watching CNBC this week has seen this in action.
3. Spread disinformation through ""analysis"" to get people to sell their stocks because ""the fundamentals aren't there"". Again, this is all over the place right now.
4. Open class action lawsuits against the company/shareholders claiming they're artificially inflating the stock price. Haven't seen it yet, but they've definitely threatened it.
5. Get the government/SEC involved alleging the same as #4. Definitely happening.
6. Pull margin shares and sell them. As seen being done by Robinhood over the last two days.
7. Spread FUD on message boards. Hello 4 million new subs pushing AMC, BB, SLV, etc.

Basically this past week has been 9/10 of the tactics in the short attack playbook to try to either push Gamestop into bankruptcy so they can profit on their short positions or slowly gain them back when people sell their stocks.

Confused what **counterfeited stock** means? Some light reading that [/u/draemon\_](https://www.reddit.com/u/draemon_/) provided explains it perfectly but beware, you actually have to read something:

* Jim Cramer, in a video-taped interview with The Street.com, best described the media function:

When (shorting) ... The hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful, because the truth is so against your view, (so the hedge funds) create a new 'truth' that is development of the fiction... you hit the brokerage houses with a series of orders (a short down ladder that pushes the price down), then we go to the press. You have a vicious cycle down - it's a pretty good game.\*

**Yet more support for the at times illegal and unethical nature of these practices: (THANK YOU,** [/u/catolicquotes](https://www.reddit.com/u/catolicquotes/)

**Pulling Margin** from long customers during a short attack serves two purposes. Obviously the flood of shares that are “forced” sales help drive the price down, which aids the short cause in general. More important, for the broker dealers who clear for their retail customers at the same time they short against them, it creates a built-in source of cheap shares from which they can cover their open short positions.

Some of the **broker dealers short against their retail customers** from their proprietary trading desks, or “prop” desks. These are trades owned by the broker dealer, and, while they are not illegal, ethical questions certainly exist. The retail customers, who may be purchasing long investments that are being pushed by the broker dealer's retail network, have no inkling that the broker is taking a large short position contrary to the retail investor's position. With the encouragement of easy margin credit, i.e. 30% equity, the retail customers load up on stock and margin debt.

**The broker dealer, in concert with other shorts, may crash the stock by flooding the board with counterfeit shares, dropping the stock price**. The broker dealers know the amount of margin debt and the price at which their retail customers get into margin trouble. They can accelerate the squeeze on their retail customers by arbitrarily increasing the equity (percentage) requirement as the price is dropping, **frequently citing “volatility”**; which is really the shorts flooding the board with counterfeit shares.

The compounding effect of a dropping price and increasing equity requirement flushes out more shares. The broker dealers sometimes will take over the account during a margin sell-off. By engaging in poor trading practices, such as heavy selling over lunch hour; concentrated “dumps” of shares; hitting the bid with market orders; and conspiring with other trading desks, **they can further plummet the value of the stock and maximize the shares they have stripped from their retail customers**.

Most of the broker dealers who have both retail customers and prop-desk trading appear to engage in these practices. Goldman, Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch have been named in suits alleging these practices. Goldman made billions shorting against the subprime mortgage industry at the same time they were selling subprime investments to their customers.

Check out real time transactions here: [https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/latest-real-time-trades](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/latest-real-time-trades)

See all the ""perfect"" orders (e.g. 100, 200, 300 shares) of nice whole numbers in the hundreds, with scattered ""imperfect orders"" (e.g. 134, 194 shares)? Notice how the nice, whole numbered orders are very predictable in pricing which varies cents off of one another?

It's a coordinated attack. Hold and chill. This isn't financial advice, just sharing something new.

**This is what the shorts are doing right now.**

**Dont feel like reading a novel? The short and dirty (TLDR AT THE FUCKING BOTTOM):**

Short Attack:

1. Sell **fake**, COUNTERFEIT stocks between hedge funds and increasingly lower ask prices to try to scare other investors into selling and/or to trigger limit sell price points. They've been doing this all week. Each major price drop has been because of this tactic.
2. Get the media to spread fear, doubt, and uncertainty. Anyone watching CNBC this week has seen this in action.
3. Spread disinformation through ""analysis"" to get people to sell their stocks because ""the fundamentals aren't there"". Again, this is all over the place right now.
4. Open class action lawsuits against the company/shareholders claiming they're artificially inflating the stock price. Haven't seen it yet, but they've definitely threatened it.
5. Get the government/SEC involved alleging the same as #4. Definitely happening.
6. Pull margin shares and sell them. As seen being done by Robinhood over the last two days.
7. Spread FUD on message boards. Hello 4 million new subs pushing AMC, BB, SLV, etc.

Basically this past week has been 9/10 of the tactics in the short attack playbook to try to either push Gamestop into bankruptcy so they can profit on their short positions or slowly gain them back when people sell their stocks.

Confused what **counterfeited stock** means? Some light reading that [/u/draemon\_](https://www.reddit.com/u/draemon_/) provided explains it perfectly but beware, you actually have to read something:

[What does counterfeit stock mean?](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html)

**Need more proof?**

Jim Cramer himself, [""here's what short sellers do, it's illegal but when you have 6 days to get out and you're down you need to foment and wipe that guy out quickly"".](https://youtu.be/VMuEis3byY4)

**This interview, which is more like a confession, was never supposed to get on the air; however, it somehow ended up on YouTube. Cramer and The Street.com have made repeated efforts, with some success, to get it taken off of YouTube. (THANKS for this info,** [/u/blancochocolate](https://www.reddit.com/u/blancochocolate/)**)**

* Jim Cramer, in a video-taped interview with The Street.com, best described the media function:

When (shorting) ... The hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful, because the truth is so against your view, (so the hedge funds) create a new 'truth' that is development of the fiction... you hit the brokerage houses with a series of orders (a short down ladder that pushes the price down), then we go to the press. You have a vicious cycle down - it's a pretty good game.\*

Investopedia \[""Short and Distort"" - illegal short tactic \]([https://www.investopedia.com/articles/analyst/030102.asp#:\~:text=Short%20and%20distort%20(S%26D)](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/analyst/030102.asp#:~:text=Short%20and%20distort%20(S%26D))

**Yet more support for the at times illegal and unethical nature of these practices: (THANK YOU,** [/u/catolicquotes](https://www.reddit.com/u/catolicquotes/)

**Pulling Margin** from long customers during a short attack serves two purposes. Obviously the flood of shares that are “forced” sales help drive the price down, which aids the short cause in general. More important, for the broker dealers who clear for their retail customers at the same time they short against them, it creates a built-in source of cheap shares from which they can cover their open short positions.

Some of the **broker dealers short against their retail customers** from their proprietary trading desks, or “prop” desks. These are trades owned by the broker dealer, and, while they are not illegal, ethical questions certainly exist. The retail customers, who may be purchasing long investments that are being pushed by the broker dealer's retail network, have no inkling that the broker is taking a large short position contrary to the retail investor's position. With the encouragement of easy margin credit, i.e. 30% equity, the retail customers load up on stock and margin debt.

**The broker dealer, in concert with other shorts, may crash the stock by flooding the board with counterfeit shares, dropping the stock price**. The broker dealers know the amount of margin debt and the price at which their retail customers get into margin trouble. They can accelerate the squeeze on their retail customers by arbitrarily increasing the equity (percentage) requirement as the price is dropping, **frequently citing “volatility”**; which is really the shorts flooding the board with counterfeit shares.

The compounding effect of a dropping price and increasing equity requirement flushes out more shares. The broker dealers sometimes will take over the account during a margin sell-off. By engaging in poor trading practices, such as heavy selling over lunch hour; concentrated “dumps” of shares; hitting the bid with market orders; and conspiring with other trading desks, **they can further plummet the value of the stock and maximize the shares they have stripped from their retail customers**.

Most of the broker dealers who have both retail customers and prop-desk trading appear to engage in these practices. Goldman, Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch have been named in suits alleging these practices. Goldman made billions shorting against the subprime mortgage industry at the same time they were selling subprime investments to their customers.

Basically what happened, from my retard understanding, is that the stock price is going up, the MMs that are required to write the options go oh fuck, because options cannot be written for higher than 50% of the stocks closing price, and now the share price is getting close to the max strike. As the price of GME increases, MMs, hedge funds, whoever are now required to buy the stock to cover the calls they've sold. As they buy more shares, the price of the share increases (since a lot of times options expire worthless). Last Friday, every single call expired in the money.

The ONE thing HOLDing everyone together is UNITY.

These snakes will do ANYTHING to DIVIDE everyone!

Even if you're innocently sharing new STONKS it can mislead real retards who've jumped on this bandwagon.

More importantly... If you have SHARES just HOLD them ALL and STOP WORRYING and STOP looking at the live market.

The BIG Infinity short squeeze is imminent and you will NOT miss it happening. IT'LL TAKE DAYS BEFORE YOU SHARE VALUE PLUMMETS.

I'm just a retard but does this mean more maintenence is required for shorting GME? Is it referring to how normally short sale accounts requires maintence requirements of 100% of stock value and 25% of market value of securities in the margin account. ([Sauce](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/05/shortmarginrequirements.asp)). So now it's more than doubled to 300%? Or am I just misunderstanding things?

If my interpretation is right (Someone with more knowledge pls correct if I'm wrong) then isn't the broker afraid there might be a squeeze so they require more capital to cover any shorts to ensure they have the money to cover?",cheseball,8,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la7d94/no_more_shares_to_short/gln3xsf/,0.048,0.815,0.138,0.8801

5318,AM," But volume IS the reason.

Think of it this way. RH does not negotiate a trade between you and someone else for a stock. They trade with you, they trade with someone else, the clearing house pockets the difference between the 'buy' and the 'sell' order pricing, the broker is paid by the CH for the order flow and given the share to give to you.

When shares are this scarce, the broker has to post significant withholding per share in the event of an unfilled order. There are two parts to this. The amount per share and the amount of shares it applies to. 

Brokers need to front the cash. Low volume low availability isn't too bad. Low volume high availability is fine but not hugely profitable. High volume high availability is ideal. High volume low availability? Suddenly they're posting 100% withholding per share on high price shares and lots of them. It disrupts other order flows and they start being hit as shares fail to deliver.

From a risk perspective not considering legality, what they did makes sense. They reduced volume and from there could meet their withholding requirements.

From a legality perspective I sincerely believe there would be hell to pay if the SEC weren't in the pocket of Citadel.

This is not financial advice. I AM a qualified insurance advisor but for the Irish market, not the US. Some things are similar such as capital withholding requirements being mandated by a central authority (in our case the Central Bank of Ireland) but a lot is different so I can only speak in general terms.

A few years ago we had to raise prices to meet new liquidity requirements by the ICB. It meant less of the money pool in investments, more in liquid cash, and our members saw a bump in policy premium with no discernable medical cost basis for it on their end. Wasn't a fun year.",I_am_salad,18,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9xxlu/retail_investors_have_every_right_to_buy_a_stock/gll4q0a/,0.093,0.817,0.09,-0.7321

My Millennial ass wasn't around to get fucked in the 1990s dot com bubble or the 2008 housing crash BUT I was around to be raised in a world where if you don't have some kind of technical skills (and often times even if you do) you have to work 2+ jobs to pay rent AKA PAY FOR THEIR FUCKING PROPERTY FOR THEM, where your only out is an extra 4+ years of specialized education in college which they have jacked the price of so fuking high by the time your done your financially crippled and ready to suck the d1ck of the first company that's willing to hire just to get out of the 40k+ hole you were trapped into, where if you FINALLY find a way to win the game they freeze the God damn market (except for the sell option so they can get out of the one loss they have ever experienced in 30+ years) they use every media outlet possible to push COMMODITIES WE NEVER FUCKING TALK ABOUT and now they have invaded our LAST FUCKING space from paid off news (what else can you call that silver shit) with shills looking to confuse and divide us out the wazoo.

2. what can you do? This is not financial advice!!!? 💎🙌 your GME to the grave. You got GME? put your phone down. Play some fucking COD, Watch a new Netflix series, do whatever it is you like to do. The hard part is over. You have what they need! Sit on your fucking hands and don't let them firing at us from all sides with FUD and misinformation win. THIS COULD BE OUR ONLY CHANCE TO SECURE A BETTER FUTURE FOR OURSELVES AND FUTURE GENERATIONS.

My Millennial ass wasn't around to get fucked in the 1990s dot com bubble or the 2008 housing crash BUT I was around to be raised in a world where if you don't have some kind of technical skills (and often times even if you do) you have to work 2+ jobs to pay rent AKA PAY FOR THEIR FUCKING PROPERTY FOR THEM, where your only out is an extra 4+ years of specialized education in college which they have jacked the price of so fuking high by the time your done your financially crippled and ready to suck the d1ck of the first company that's willing to hire just to get out of the 40k+ hole you were trapped into, where if you FINALLY find a way to win the game they freeze the God damn market (except for the sell option so they can get out of the one loss they have ever experienced in 30+ years) they use every media outlet possible to push COMMODITIES WE NEVER FUCKING TALK ABOUT and now they have invaded our LAST FUCKING space from paid off news (what else can you call that silver shit) with shills looking to confuse and divide us out the wazoo.

2. what can you do? This is not financial advice!!!? 💎🙌 your GME to the grave. You got GME? put your phone down. Play some fucking COD, Watch a new Netflix series, do whatever it is you like to do. The hard part is over. You have what they need! Sit on your fucking hands and don't let them firing at us from all sides with FUD and misinformation win. THIS COULD BE OUR ONLY CHANCE TO SECURE A BETTER FUTURE FOR OURSELVES AND FUTURE GENERATIONS.

3. 10K+ IS NOT A MEME. I'll say it again, 10K+ IS NOT A MEME. Do you understand our fundamentals? The short is still well over 100% for GME and GME alone. Everything else is actual speculation. HEDGES HAVE TO BUY. They need GME like we need air. And we're not going to fkkng give it to them!

Their strategy is this: They want us to believe they are out when in fact THEY ARE NOT. We have them by the balls. They want us to believe the war is over so that we leave and tank the stock price down. 


That's why Friday was not that much of a brutal day, to make it seem they have no reason to stir up waters because they are out, that they left. Late Thursday they have LIED they are out. (using places like cnbc and not an official press release that would have them liable). This is their narrative, they try anything to make you give up.


When we give up (NEVER!) is when they will make money, DO NOT GIVE THEM YOUR MONEY, STAY HERE, that's the reason they keep shorting or ""doubling down"" because they believe we will go home and they also want to make it seem like the virality of the movement is over which is not true, it's just getting started.


They think we are cowards, thugs, scared weak sheep, gulible. WHICH WE ARE NOT. And that's how we will further be painted if you give up and go home. DON'T GO HOME. THIS IS YOUR NEW HOME. 


I believe everyone one of you, as you have demonstrated everyday and especially Thursday, is here to stay and make these evil psychopaths PAY and PAY BIG, Remember this is our mission, not to make a few bucks but that we LOVE THE STOCK. We HOLD for as long as we need. As you've seen DeepFuckingValue is DIAMOND BALLS DEEP IN. 


BECAUSE WE ARE IN LOVE WITH THE STOCK. 


Desperately they tried to make some money Thursday and succeeded by using evil and illegal tactics, by doubling down on the short then closing robinhood and tanking the market. They make money when the stock goes down BUT IT WILL NOT GO DOWN BECAUSE WE HOLD.


But if WE HOLD then it won't go down and THEY WILL PAY EVERY SINGLE DAY. As long as we HOLD then it's costing them big money every single day then the stock price is high and they have to pay those stocks that they shorted.  STAY FOCUSED ON THE MISSION. Do not let yourself distracted and TRUST NOBODY, only this place.

GME got shorted, flipped upside down

And I’d like to take a minute

Just sit with me

I'll tell you how I became a retard on WSB


    


During recession after recession I was born and raised

Seeing hedge fund make billions with crooked plays

Browsing memes and shitposting on the internets

When I stumble across fellow retards on WallStreetBets

A few million autists who were up to some good

Started making trouble on Robinhood

GME shot up and the hedge funds got scared

They said 'You're stealing from the wealthy and that ain't fair""",Dorian182,1418,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la0n4z/daily_discussion_thread_for_february_01_2021/gll5lwf/,0.177,0.736,0.087,-0.885
5656,AMC," The reason the entire market dipped last week is because the hedges were forced to sell their long positions in other companies to raise capital to cover the shorts on GME. It’s important to note that these long positions were companies they fully believed in and backed to generate profits over the long term. They’ve had to sell their ‘safe’ bets to try and cover the shorts. But.. they CANNOT fully cover while we hold 💎🤲🏻 AND continue to buy more at every opportunity.

What does that mean? Short and simple they are fucked. Even after all the desperate, shady, ILLEGAL shit they pulled last week.. did we sell? Fuck no. Are we going to sell? Fuck no 💎🤲🏻

The stock price may not yet reflect it but you best believe the squeeze is absolutely 100% working.

So what to do? Well obviously hold what you have ,and.. buy buy buy!!! GME is by far the most shorted stock and is 100% the worst of their problems and therefore should be our primary focus, however, we can compound this movement, and apply additional pressure by buying other majorly shorted stocks. AMC is the next best pick and also far cheaper per share (around $13). Let’s fuck them from all angles!

Please google the word ""silver"" and look at the news. They are using the media to try and manipulate the price of silver to go up which hedgefunds apparently own large portions of in a desperate attempt to trick non-redditors into buying silver. They are saying we all are going in on silver and that it is ""surging"" even though it only just went up a mere 3 dollars since last week. Any profits they make from manipulating the price silver, they will use to try and cover their GME shorts. Please pass this info along to regular people, don't let them be fooled.

6103,CAN," The Reason We can't just Buy Back In.

The Meme: Buy, Hold, Never sell.

Why do we have to Diamond Hand so hard right now? Can't we just buy dips to increase our holdings? 

NO. ABSOLUTELY NOT.

Because we control the stocks. THEY control the shorts. Sure, you CAN buy back at a dip, but this is 2 steps forward and countless steps back.

Imagine: a trader shorts his GME out expecting GameStop to go under. He gets his money, the stock is loaned, and he doesn't pay a cent. Now: imagine this second trader shorts this stock. This share is officially over-shorted. Repeat this 3, 4, 5, a gorillion times, it doesn't matter. At the end of the day, it's only one share taken hostage.

If you sell a single share, that entire line of overshorts vanishes as they just loan back the stock up the chain at a loss. We can't make them short after we buy back in.

THAT is why we can't just sell and buy back the dips. If we sell, the dips will become a permanent crash. WE control the stocks. THEY control the shorts.

If WE give them the power to eradicate their short chains, they win. If WE DON'T give them the power to eradicate their chains, they will end up insolvent and we win. Exponential gains down the road. Debt + (Debt*Interest) = OUR GAINS. 

THAT IS WHY YOU CAN'T SELL. IF YOU SELL, WE ALL LOSE. IF YOU HOLD, WE ALL WIN.

Not Financial Advice, of course. I just love the stock.

I get this instance is almost certainly just a dumb spam scam, but..

A lot of people are talking about this being a huge wealth redistribution.. that's great. But there's a big flaw.. you need to but shares in the first place.  
There's people here who are easily buying hundreds, thousands, even more, shares. These people aren't exactly in poverty or lower class and they're gonna make millions *when* GME rockets.  
Then there's the people who really need the wealth redistribution who can barely afford a share or two.. or not even a single one. They'll make a lot less or none at all..  
I feel like if we tried, we could organize some kind of share donation/semi-equalization event/system/thing. People with tons of shares sharing a few to people who have barely any/none.

6145,CAN," The Reason We can't just Buy Back In.

The Meme: Buy, Hold, Never sell.

Why do we have to Diamond Hand so hard right now? Can't we just buy dips to increase our holdings? 

NO. ABSOLUTELY NOT.

Because we control the stocks. THEY control the shorts. Sure, you CAN buy back at a dip, but this is 2 steps forward and countless steps back.

Imagine: a trader shorts his GME out expecting GameStop to go under. He gets his money, the stock is loaned, and he doesn't pay a cent. Now: imagine this second trader shorts this stock. This share is officially over-shorted. Repeat this 3, 4, 5, a gorillion times, it doesn't matter. At the end of the day, it's only one share taken hostage.

If you sell a single share, that entire line of overshorts vanishes as they just loan back the stock up the chain at a loss. We can't make them short after we buy back in.

THAT is why we can't just sell and buy back the dips. If we sell, the dips will become a permanent crash. WE control the stocks. THEY control the shorts.

If WE give them the power to eradicate their short chains, they win. If WE DON'T give them the power to eradicate their chains, they will end up insolvent and we win. Exponential gains down the road. Debt + (Debt*Interest) = OUR GAINS. 

THAT IS WHY YOU CAN'T SELL. IF YOU SELL, WE ALL LOSE. IF YOU HOLD, WE ALL WIN.

Not Financial Advice, of course. I just love the stock.

*Not financial Advice...just common sense*

**To Adam Arron - CEO of AMC,**

Are you listening? We got your back. So what are you planning to do about it? I've been thinking for a month about what **should** you do to save AMC, with our help. We did the hard-work and won't stop but now you need to step up. Your deal with Silver Lake to wipe out $600m was a good start. Wipe out 10% debt...let market absorb the 15% dilution, and keep going letting the shorts foot the bill. We watch the numbers. We know your stock is 79% sold short (44.7/56.6m), 2nd only to GME. We know you are being left for dead by the HF. We have no intention of letting that happen (#SaveAMC). We have given our support, but you have to return the favor.

We know where you are in Leawood. We know who you are. We know your rank and file employees are people like us. We know you want to survive. We want you to survive. Do not even think about making a deal for a secondary with HF like D1 Capital. You might get cash but you will go the way of RH. *You need us more than we need you*. We are the largest Hedge Fund in the world. Don't believe me? Then believe [Chamath](https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1355580731980869637).

You have a choice. ***Reinvent AMC*** by converting enough debt, slowly, to shares ***with lockups.*** Then negotiate *exclusive* partnerships with the DNA (Disney/Netflix/Apple) of new entertainment media to provide the ""*get away*"" experience we still need sometimes. Covid will subside. Traffic will come back. Not everyone pays for all 3 of the DNA streaming services. You have kitchens and liquor licenses in your locations. You have people to cleanup after us. We can relax and chill. We will come.

But don't stop there. With your newfound partnerships and lower debt-load, attract new very long-term debt (10-year) with attractive rates. Use that money to money to rip out those stupid section of chairs at floor-level no one uses. Replace it with fully networked raised flooring, ready to hookup gaming stations, and partner with $GME to establish the e-Olympics of eSports. Brand it. Be the exclusive venue across the world for all regional national qualifying events for every popular game that will ever be developed from now until eternity. Then every 2 years hold the Super Bowl of eSports, the e-Olympics. Sell advertising to the world. Corner that market. If people say it won't work, tell them you got the room, the bar, the big screen and tech to stream, and the partnerships to go global and no one else has the money to catch up. Sell exclusive merch. Let us come in and yell, scream, be rowdy and cheer on locals fighting to make it to the big stage each year or to the global stage every 2. Give us the chance to let lose and make local heroes and celebrities out of our team as they compete. Be the company brave enough and bold enough to usher in the new world of interactive entertainment of eSports.

You got the equipment, the room, the setups....now, thanks to us, you have the opportunity. If you need help figuring out the details, you know where to find me. We got your back, do you have the brains to do something with it?

Sincerely, Your Future

**To George Sherman CEO of Gamestop,**

Are you listening? Read our letter to AMC. We got **your** back too. So what are you planning to do about it? See what AMC did? See what RH did? Which path you going to take? RH was on the way up, before they screwed up. We know they had issues, but in their attempts to survive, they got in our way. Bad mistake. Look at AMC? They didn't make a deal with the devil (HF). They didn't bail out HF betting you would crash and burn. Do not even think about making a deal for a secondary with the Hedge Funds. We hear Melvin Capital and Citron supposedly closed out, but others stepped in to try to destroy you. You might get cash by doing a deal with the Devil but you too would go the way of RH. *You need us more than we need you*. We have grass-roots support and big names believe in our power to make a change for the better. Don't believe me? Believe [Elon](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1354174279894642703)

Let me quote Daniel LaRusso in Cobra Kai (quoting himself from Karate Kid quoting Mr. Myagi)

>""Live or Die man?""

Let me repeat, we have your back. Be smart. We have given our support, but you have to return the favor. We know your rank and file employees across America are people like us. We know you want to survive. We want you to survive.

You have a choice. ***Reinvent GME*** by converting your debt, like AMC, slowly, to shares ***with lockups.*** You're debt is < 3% of your market-cap. Sell just enough stock to erases your debts and give you $2b to reinvent. That's < 10% of your market-cap. You will have HF lining up to go long if you pitch a ""*stick it to your competition*"" angle combined with the billions in free press you would get. Use that money to outfit half your store floor-space to mini-streaming venues. Most your stores are in strip-mall locations. You can probably take over **more** space if needed. Establish a 10-year partnership with AMC for the e-Olympics branding. Every weekend, you can run ""local qualifying events"". You can make technical partnerships with the DNA (Disney/Netflix/Apple). They have the streaming infrastructure. You just have to hook-in. Let them handle the details of programming access to ""local content"". Let them do a revenue-share as you become a massive content provider the second you flip on the webcams. That's a massive revenue stream. You can sell lower-priced regional subscriptions for local content. There's another revenue stream. You can charge entry fees to cover costs and more. That's a 3rd revenue stream. You can market the larger Regional events held at AMC (free marketing for AMC) while they market the local qualifiers held at your local Gamestop (free marketing for you). You both sell Merch. It is a no-brainer.

You have the support. You have the locations and the goodwill. You have a forward-thinking new board member. If you need help figuring out the details, you know where to find me.

RH was on the way up, before they screwed up. We know they had issues, but in their attempts to survive, they got in our way. Bad mistake. Look at AMC? They didn't make a deal with the devil (HF). They didn't bail out HF betting you would crash and burn. Do not even think about making a deal for a secondary with the Hedge Funds. We hear Melvin Capital and Citron supposedly closed out, but others stepped in to try to destroy you. You might get cash by doing a deal with the Devil but you too would go the way of RH. *You need us more than we need you*. We have grass-roots support and big names believe in our power to make a change for the better. Don't believe me? Believe [Elon](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1354174279894642703)

Let me quote Daniel LaRusso in Cobra Kai (quoting himself from Karate Kid quoting Mr. Myagi)

>""Live or Die man?""

Let me repeat, we have your back. Be smart. We have given our support, but you have to return the favor. We know your rank and file employees across America are people like us. We know you want to survive. We want you to survive.

You have a choice. ***Reinvent GME*** by converting your debt, like AMC, slowly, to shares ***with lockups.*** You're debt is < 3% of your market-cap. Sell just enough stock to erases your debts and give you $2b to reinvent. That's < 10% of your market-cap. You will have HF lining up to go long if you pitch a ""*stick it to your competition*"" angle combined with the billions in free press you would get. Use that money to outfit half your store floor-space to mini-streaming venues. Most your stores are in strip-mall locations. You can probably take over **more** space if needed. Establish a 10-year partnership with AMC for the e-Olympics branding. Every weekend, you can run ""local qualifying events"". You can make technical partnerships with the DNA (Disney/Netflix/Apple). They have the streaming infrastructure. You just have to hook-in. Let them handle the details of programming access to ""local content"". Let them do a revenue-share as you become a massive content provider the second you flip on the webcams. That's a massive revenue stream. You can sell lower-priced regional subscriptions for local content. There's another revenue stream. You can charge entry fees to cover costs and more. That's a 3rd revenue stream. You can market the larger Regional events held at AMC (free marketing for AMC) while they market the local qualifiers held at your local Gamestop (free marketing for you). You both sell Merch. It is a no-brainer.

You have the support. You have the locations and the goodwill. You have a forward-thinking new board member. If you need help figuring out the details, you know where to find me.

Sincerely, Your Future

6150,GME," **TL;DR** GME/AMC have a chance to piggyback on community support. Not only survive, but reinvent and become something bigger than they EVER could without us. Stop thinking $1000/$100. Be thinking about leaving these stonks for your grandkids in 50 years!. Think like you are collectively the new-age decentralized and democratically-ran HF that is helping these companies build the next Amazon, TSLA, or Google. These two companies can transform into something as big as Google or Amazon if they play cards right.

**To Adam Arron - CEO of AMC,**

Are you listening? We got your back. So what are you planning to do about it? I've been thinking for a month about what **should** you do to save AMC, with our help. We did the hard-work and won't stop but now you need to step up. Your deal with Silver Lake to wipe out $600m was a good start. Wipe out 10% debt...let market absorb the 15% dilution, and keep going letting the shorts foot the bill. We watch the numbers. We know your stock is 79% sold short (44.7/56.6m), 2nd only to GME. We know you are being left for dead by the HF. We have no intention of letting that happen (#SaveAMC). We have given our support, but you have to return the favor.

We know where you are in Leawood. We know who you are. We know your rank and file employees are people like us. We know you want to survive. We want you to survive. Do not even think about making a deal for a secondary with HF like D1 Capital. You might get cash but you will go the way of RH. *You need us more than we need you*. We are the largest Hedge Fund in the world. Don't believe me? Then believe [Chamath](https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1355580731980869637).

You have a choice. ***Reinvent AMC*** by converting enough debt, slowly, to shares ***with lockups.*** Then negotiate *exclusive* partnerships with the DNA (Disney/Netflix/Apple) of new entertainment media to provide the ""*get away*"" experience we still need sometimes. Covid will subside. Traffic will come back. Not everyone pays for all 3 of the DNA streaming services. You have kitchens and liquor licenses in your locations. You have people to cleanup after us. We can relax and chill. We will come.

But don't stop there. With your newfound partnerships and lower debt-load, attract new very long-term debt (10-year) with attractive rates. Use that money to money to rip out those stupid section of chairs at floor-level no one uses. Replace it with fully networked raised flooring, ready to hookup gaming stations, and partner with $GME to establish the e-Olympics of eSports. Brand it. Be the exclusive venue across the world for all regional national qualifying events for every popular game that will ever be developed from now until eternity. Then every 2 years hold the Super Bowl of eSports, the e-Olympics. Sell advertising to the world. Corner that market. If people say it won't work, tell them you got the room, the bar, the big screen and tech to stream, and the partnerships to go global and no one else has the money to catch up. Sell exclusive merch. Let us come in and yell, scream, be rowdy and cheer on locals fighting to make it to the big stage each year or to the global stage every 2. Give us the chance to let lose and make local heroes and celebrities out of our team as they compete. Be the company brave enough and bold enough to usher in the new world of interactive entertainment of eSports.

You got the equipment, the room, the setups....now, thanks to us, you have the opportunity. If you need help figuring out the details, you know where to find me. We got your back, do you have the brains to do something with it?

Sincerely, Your Future

Predictions:

GME will start the week with wild fluctuations.  Shorts will still try to ladder attack and force the price down.  Ultimately, strong hands will hold and/or buy through the dips.  Shorts will continue to fuck themselves because they are simply not used to using to retail investors and believe they can outlast them.  They are wrong.  Ultimately GME will go to Mars.

AMC does not have the same amount of short interest as GME but it has plenty of fuel and a good amount of interest.  Also, investor sentiment is high.  The funds already raised by AMC have rescued this company from its debt.  Covid hurt but people are going to want to go back to the movies once the pandemic is under control.

My Millennial ass wasn't around to get fucked in the 1990s dot com bubble or the 2008 housing crash BUT I was around to be raised in a world where if you don't have some kind of technical skills (and often times even if you do) you have to work 2+ jobs to pay rent AKA PAY FOR THEIR FUCKING PROPERTY FOR THEM, where your only out is an extra 4+ years of specialized education in college which they have jacked the price of so fuking high by the time your done your financially crippled and ready to suck the d1ck of the first company that's willing to hire just to get out of the 40k+ hole you were trapped into, where if you FINALLY find a way to win the game they freeze the God damn market (except for the sell option so they can get out of the one loss they have ever experienced in 30+ years) they use every media outlet possible to push COMMODITIES WE NEVER FUCKING TALK ABOUT and now they have invaded our LAST FUCKING space from paid off news (what else can you call that silver shit) with shills looking to confuse and divide us out the wazoo.

2. what can you do? This is not financial advice!!!? 💎🙌 your GME to the grave. You got GME? put your phone down. Play some fucking COD, Watch a new Netflix series, do whatever it is you like to do. The hard part is over. You have what they need! Sit on your fucking hands and don't let them firing at us from all sides with FUD and misinformation win. THIS COULD BE OUR ONLY CHANCE TO SECURE A BETTER FUTURE FOR OURSELVES AND FUTURE GENERATIONS.

3. 10K+ IS NOT A MEME. I'll say it again, 10K+ IS NOT A MEME. Do you understand our fundamentals? The short is still well over 100% for GME and GME alone. Everything else is actual speculation. HEDGES HAVE TO BUY. They need GME like we need air. And we're not going to fkkng give it to them!

>*”The volume is low”*.

What does this mean? The total volume of shares being moved around is LOW. The dips you are seeing are artificial and are NOT due to people selling shares. It’s illegal market manipulation at its finest.

Hedge funders sell their shares to each other at lower and lower bids (by tiny amounts) in rapid succession using bots. This tricks the algorithm into thinking a shit ton of shares are being dumped = the price is shown to go down.

In reality, no one is selling. Hedge funders are just moving shares between each other. If people were actually selling, you’d need at least 10x the volume to bring the price down like that.

6303,MSM," I WILL REPEAT:

if the hedge funds had a way out to victory they would have used it already.

if they had closed all their shorts we would know because volume of trade and they would be the first to be bragging at how they beat us and showing us proof of their exit so they could smugly watch the mass selloff and wojaking of 8 million peasant class normies so they could wag their fingers at you on CNN and say ""i told you so! investing is for the professionals!""

instead they have to resort to childish tricks by using paid shills in MSM to spread fake news to try and get us to disband and panic while they quietly maintain their silence and dont comment on anything.

just face it, we are winning and the only way we can lose is if we lose faith and panic out and thats exactly what their only strategy is. they will try to exploit the fact that a few shekels means a lot to you and you will panic sell at the first 20% dip or after 4 days of holding give up because each day feels riskier than before especially the more you worry and talk among other peasants.

6304,EVER," Here's a thought: Every single day there's been someone in here saying the shorts were covered and that we should sell now. That the party's over and it will all crash now so better sell. It's been in comments, on financial news, on Twitter, from hedge funds, on Wallstreet, etc. Every. Single. Day. And every single day that's been false. Every day we've gone through this same pattern where everything looks terrifying out of the gate (one detail at this point that should be pretty concerning btw. Why is every additional day full of more of the same scary price manipulation spikes for hours until it goes right back to where we were with no real changes?) and every day we go right back up again. 

If you've held through all that, what would possibly convince you that it actually is over? Notice that message seems to get louder too from more places every day. Just random people saying ""OH IT'S OVER. SELL."" Have you ever seen such an aggressive push for something like that on a stock before every single day? All I'm getting at is so far that message has been blatantly wrong to the point that it would be considered a lie to repeat it. So why would you trust it if you saw it now? And why the fuck would anyone care about you losing a few hundred bucks? Have they EVER cared before? Or only now while billionaires stand to lose a lot of money?",theyhaveitsoeasy,193,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lab86a/gme_discussion_thread_for_february_1_2021_part_3/gln1obf/,0.103,0.824,0.073,-0.8056
6305,IBKR," PSA: It has been all but 100% confirmed that now Schwab, E-Trade, IBKR, AND Fidelity all no longer have shares to be shorted.

6306,AMC," S3 Partners have tweaked their algorithm to not factor synthetic longs into Short Interest. This is why when last week when S3 said the SI on GME was 113% it was way lower than everyone else who said SI was closer to 140%. 

This is why you shouldn’t be scared when they claim GME SI is 53% The *real* short interest (as most people would count it) is significantly higher then this. I have seen numbers saying 120% SI as of Friday but I cannot confirm this. 

For the record (as I know people will ask) they don’t release AMC numbers publicly unless you pay but they would use the same algorithm for AMC meaning *GME is still more shorted than AMC and probably still the most shorted stock in the world*. 

*BuT ShOrTs NoT HiGhEr ThEn 100% PeRcEnT* 

It **doesn’t** matter. Go back to investorpedia if you don’t understand this. The Volkswagen squeeze was triggered at around 40% of the short interest. In theory you could trigger a short squeeze at **1%** of outstanding shorts if you have enough people willing to hold. 

People have casted doubt over S3 Partners numbers citing there isn’t simply enough volume for them to cover what they claimed they covered, that might be true,  however **even if we take S3’s numbers at face value there is still an astronomical number of shorted GME shares** especially when we factor in how many shares are owned by institutions who are long and board members who aren’t allowed to sell.

This is why you shouldn’t be scared when they claim GME SI is 53% The *real* short interest (as most people would count it) is significantly higher then this. I have seen numbers saying 120% SI as of Friday but I cannot confirm this. 

For the record (as I know people will ask) they don’t release AMC numbers publicly unless you pay but they would use the same algorithm for AMC meaning *GME is still more shorted than AMC and probably still the most shorted stock in the world*.

It **doesn’t** matter. Go back to investorpedia if you don’t understand this. The Volkswagen squeeze was triggered at around 40% of the short interest. In theory you could trigger a short squeeze at **1%** of outstanding shorts if you have enough people willing to hold. 

People have casted doubt over S3 Partners numbers citing there isn’t simply enough volume for them to cover what they claimed they covered, that might be true,  however **even if we take S3’s numbers at face value there is still an astronomical number of shorted GME shares** especially when we factor in how many shares are owned by institutions who are long and board members who aren’t allowed to sell.

6309,FOR," EXPLANATION FOR WORRIED NEWBIE TRADERS 👇🏻

”The volume is low”.

What does this mean? The total volume of shares being moved around is LOW. The dips you are seeing are artificial and are NOT due to people selling shares. It’s illegal market manipulation at its finest.

Hedge funders sell their shares to each other at lower and lower bids (by tiny amounts) in rapid succession using bots. This tricks the algorithm into thinking a shit ton of shares are being dumped = the price is shown to go down.

In reality, no one is selling. Hedge funders are just moving shares between each other. If people were actually selling, you’d need at least 10x the volume to bring the price down like that.

So, stop panicking pussies. They’ve been doing this all week. Stop staring at your screen and watching every dollar movement. Go for a walk without a phone, have a shower, damn have breakfast if you haven’t already. Share this info to other newbie traders

Info of volume can be see in level 2 market data, found free on this stream:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQbg_WU-0AQ&ab_channel=StocksBigPlays

WHAT'S TO STOP THEM FROM DOING THIS FOREVER?

Well, unlike us retarded diamond handed monkeys, everyone with a short position has to pay daily interest on their positions to their broker.

Gentlemen, I'm new here but I'm a mathematician at heart (I'm a big fan of my username, google it) and didn't had much time at my disposal to spend on reddit


Their strategy is this: They want us to believe they are out when in fact THEY ARE NOT. We have them by the balls. They want us to believe the war is over so that we leave and tank the stock price down. 


That's why Friday was not that much of a brutal day, to make it seem they have no reason to stir up waters because they are out, that they left. Late Thursday they have LIED they are out. (using places like cnbc and not an official press release that would have them liable). This is their narrative, they try anything to make you give up.


When we give up (NEVER!) is when they will make money, DO NOT GIVE THEM YOUR MONEY, STAY HERE, that's the reason they keep shorting or ""doubling down"" because they believe we will go home and they also want to make it seem like the virality of the movement is over which is not true, it's just getting started.


They think we are cowards, thugs, scared weak sheep, gulible. WHICH WE ARE NOT. And that's how we will further be painted if you give up and go home. DON'T GO HOME. THIS IS YOUR NEW HOME. 


I believe everyone one of you, as you have demonstrated everyday and especially Thursday, is here to stay and make these evil psychopaths PAY and PAY BIG, Remember this is our mission, not to make a few bucks but that we LOVE THE STOCK. We HOLD for as long as we need. As you've seen DeepFuckingValue is DIAMOND BALLS DEEP IN. 


BECAUSE WE ARE IN LOVE WITH THE STOCK. 


Desperately they tried to make some money Thursday and succeeded by using evil and illegal tactics, by doubling down on the short then closing robinhood and tanking the market. They make money when the stock goes down BUT IT WILL NOT GO DOWN BECAUSE WE HOLD.


But if WE HOLD then it won't go down and THEY WILL PAY EVERY SINGLE DAY. As long as we HOLD then it's costing them big money every single day then the stock price is high and they have to pay those stocks that they shorted.  STAY FOCUSED ON THE MISSION. Do not let yourself distracted and TRUST NOBODY, only this place.

>*”The volume is low”*.

What does this mean? The total volume of shares being moved around is LOW. The dips you are seeing are artificial and are NOT due to people selling shares. It’s illegal market manipulation at its finest.

Hedge funders sell their shares to each other at lower and lower bids (by tiny amounts) in rapid succession using bots. This tricks the algorithm into thinking a shit ton of shares are being dumped = the price is shown to go down.

In reality, no one is selling. Hedge funders are just moving shares between each other. If people were actually selling, you’d need at least 10x the volume to bring the price down like that.

So, stop panicking pussies. They’ve been doing this all week. Stop staring at your screen and watching every dollar movement. Go for a walk without a phone, have a shower, damn have breakfast if you haven’t already. Share this info to other newbie traders

Info of volume can be see in level 2 market data, found free on this stream:[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQbg\_WU-0AQ&ab\_channel=StocksBigPlays](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQbg_WU-0AQ&ab_channel=StocksBigPlays)

>*”The volume is low”*.

What does this mean? The total volume of shares being moved around is LOW. The dips you are seeing are artificial and are NOT due to people selling shares. It’s illegal market manipulation at its finest.

Hedge funders sell their shares to each other at lower and lower bids (by tiny amounts) in rapid succession using bots. This tricks the algorithm into thinking a shit ton of shares are being dumped = the price is shown to go down.

In reality, no one is selling. Hedge funders are just moving shares between each other. If people were actually selling, you’d need at least 10x the volume to bring the price down like that.

So, stop panicking pussies. They’ve been doing this all week. Stop staring at your screen and watching every dollar movement. Go for a walk without a phone, have a shower, damn have breakfast if you haven’t already. Share this info to other newbie traders

Info of volume can be see in level 2 market data, found free on this stream:[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQbg\_WU-0AQ&ab\_channel=StocksBigPlays](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQbg_WU-0AQ&ab_channel=StocksBigPlays)

**WHAT'S TO STOP THEM FROM DOING THIS FOREVER?**

Well, unlike us retarded diamond handed monkeys, everyone with a short position has to pay daily interest on their positions to their broker. The longer they wait the more they have to pay to stay in the game.

Gentlemen, I'm new here but I'm a mathematician at heart (I'm a big fan of my username, google it) and didn't had much time at my disposal to spend on reddit


Their strategy is this: They want us to believe they are out when in fact THEY ARE NOT. We have them by the balls. They want us to believe the war is over so that we leave and tank the stock price down. 


That's why Friday was not that much of a brutal day, to make it seem they have no reason to stir up waters because they are out, that they left. Late Thursday they have LIED they are out. (using places like cnbc and not an official press release that would have them liable). This is their narrative, they try anything to make you give up.


When we give up (NEVER!) is when they will make money, DO NOT GIVE THEM YOUR MONEY, STAY HERE, that's the reason they keep shorting or ""doubling down"" because they believe we will go home and they also want to make it seem like the virality of the movement is over which is not true, it's just getting started.


They think we are cowards, thugs, scared weak sheep, gulible. WHICH WE ARE NOT. And that's how we will further be painted if you give up and go home. DON'T GO HOME. THIS IS YOUR NEW HOME. 


I believe everyone one of you, as you have demonstrated everyday and especially Thursday, is here to stay and make these evil psychopaths PAY and PAY BIG, Remember this is our mission, not to make a few bucks but that we LOVE THE STOCK. We HOLD for as long as we need. As you've seen DeepFuckingValue is DIAMOND BALLS DEEP IN. 


BECAUSE WE ARE IN LOVE WITH THE STOCK. 


Desperately they tried to make some money Thursday and succeeded by using evil and illegal tactics, by doubling down on the short then closing robinhood and tanking the market. They make money when the stock goes down BUT IT WILL NOT GO DOWN BECAUSE WE HOLD.


But if WE HOLD then it won't go down and THEY WILL PAY EVERY SINGLE DAY. As long as we HOLD then it's costing them big money every single day then the stock price is high and they have to pay those stocks that they shorted.  STAY FOCUSED ON THE MISSION. Do not let yourself distracted and TRUST NOBODY, only this place. Remember this is their strategy, that's why Friday things weren't that brutal, before Friday they have also ""announced"" and lied that their position is over BUT IT IS NOT.

I live in Italy, and i own 2 shares of GME.

I shit you not, my bank just called (it was 7:30 pm local time) to ask me to remove the threshold, because ""it will never be executed at that price"". 

I said i knew it was unlikely, but it was part of my strategy. I asked if i was doing any damage to the bank by doing so, and he said no. So basically they called me for no reason at all? Lmao, they called because they cant fucking lend my shares if i have a sell threshold on them, but the fucker didnt want to admit it.

6369,GME," All the newbs in here are going to learn a harsh lesson about why diamond hands are required. It's not about suicidally holding till zero, it's about the old boomer adage; time in the market beats timing the market.

Do you believe in the underlying thesis of why GME is going to the moon? You should, because in my opinion (which is not financial advice, I am not a financial advisor)  it's a fucking slam dunk. 

Nothing in life is certain, but this is the closest any market play will ever get. These wall street guys have mathematically guaranteed their own failure. So calm the fuck down, do a little research instead of watching a line graph, and either be confident in your position or sell like a bitch and live with the regret of what you could have had. Boldness is not for everyone, and it's fine if you choose to be safe,  I don't blame you, a life of mediocrity is all some people can aspire to, and there is no shame in that. As long as you are aware of the person you are becoming, a safe mediocre person who will fold when an opportunity comes.

>*”The volume is low”*.

What does this mean? The total volume of shares being moved around is LOW. The dips you are seeing are artificial and are NOT due to people selling shares. It’s illegal market manipulation at its finest.

Hedge funders sell their shares to each other at lower and lower bids (by tiny amounts) in rapid succession using bots. This tricks the algorithm into thinking a shit ton of shares are being dumped = the price is shown to go down.

In reality, no one is selling. Hedge funders are just moving shares between each other. If people were actually selling, you’d need at least 10x the volume to bring the price down like that.

So, stop panicking pussies. They’ve been doing this all week. Stop staring at your screen and watching every dollar movement. Go for a walk without a phone, have a shower, damn have breakfast if you haven’t already. Share this info to other newbie traders

Hi Guys,

Today the SEC data on the failures to deliver just came out for the first half of January. Note that GME has been on the SEC Threshold List since the 8th of December. This list was created by the SEC to make sure they could keep their eyes on abusive naked short-selling, but just like 2008 they're asleep at the wheel. **When you short a share, you have to deliver the shares to the buyer within 2 days. If not, it's classed as a failure to deliver and signifies that you sold shares without having them or being able to locate them a.k.a naked short-selling**

I just combed through the data on this (you can go through it yourself and add up the ""GME"" failures to deliver) and the failures to deliver added up to **5,074,937** shares. **That's almost 10% of the whole fucking free float.** We don't even have the data on what's happened after the first half of January, but I assume it must be higher because of the even greater price spikes we have seen.

This is **FUCKING CRIMINAL** and all of these idiots deserve to go to jail for what they've done. They got their hand caught in the cookie jar shorting **140% of the free float** of GME, then halt trading at the same time across the world and then tank to get the paper hands to sell. **Now they're pushing the narrative that we're focusing on silver** which is complete BULLSHIT. **All the posts calling for silver are 2 day old Citadel/Melvin shill accounts, DO NOT LISTEN TO THEM.**

The facts are on our side. The hedge funds cannot suddenly change the rules of the game so the SEC can't report failures to deliver. The fact that they most of them don't have **ANY SHARES** to actually back their short position, I think that the short interest is still heavily underreported (don't listen to S3 or any of the sellouts, check Finwiz).

**So, continue holding. DON'T LET ANYONE TELL YOU THAT WE DON'T HAVE THEM BY THE FUCKING BALLS. WE DO, AND IT'S TIME TO PAY THE PIPER.**

6403,GME," If you've got diamond hands you're holding right now and the only interesting to do right now is buy this dip.  The thing everyone needs to understand is that this siege could go on for a few more weeks.  It's possible for GME to sit at a $150-250 firewall through the end of February if they keep laddering it.  But they are *hemorrhaging* every day this stock sits north of $60/share.  The time will come when they need to buy back in, and if we're all still holding when that comes, that's the rocket.  

Don't watch the ticker right now and don't want the news.  Huge amounts of money and effort are being spent to scare you into selling.

EXPLANATION FOR WORRIED NEWBIE TRADERS 👇🏻

”The volume is low”.

What does this mean? The total volume of shares being moved around is LOW. The dips you are seeing are artificial and are NOT due to people selling shares. It’s illegal market manipulation at its finest.

Hedge funders sell their shares to each other at lower and lower bids (by tiny amounts) in rapid succession using bots. This tricks the algorithm into thinking a shit ton of shares are being dumped = the price is shown to go down.

In reality, no one is selling. Hedge funders are just moving shares between each other. If people were actually selling, you’d need at least 10x the volume to bring the price down like that.

So, stop panicking pussies. They’ve been doing this all week. Stop staring at your screen and watching every dollar movement. Go for a walk without a phone, have a shower, damn have breakfast if you haven’t already. Share this info to other newbie traders

Info of volume can be see in level 2 market data, found free on this stream:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQbg_WU-0AQ&ab_channel=StocksBigPlays

WHAT'S TO STOP THEM FROM DOING THIS FOREVER?

Well, unlike us retarded diamond handed monkeys, everyone with a short position has to pay daily interest on their positions to their broker.

EXPLANATION FOR WORRIED NEWBIE TRADERS 👇🏻

>*”The volume is low”*.

What does this mean? The total volume of shares being moved around is LOW. The dips you are seeing are artificial and are NOT due to people selling shares. It’s illegal market manipulation at its finest.

Hedge funders sell their shares to each other at lower and lower bids (by tiny amounts) in rapid succession using bots. This tricks the algorithm into thinking a shit ton of shares are being dumped = the price is shown to go down.

In reality, no one is selling. Hedge funders are just moving shares between each other. If people were actually selling, you’d need at least 10x the volume to bring the price down like that.

So, stop panicking pussies. They’ve been doing this all week. Stop staring at your screen and watching every dollar movement. Go for a walk without a phone, have a shower, damn have breakfast if you haven’t already. Share this info to other newbie traders

If they could they would have when it went to its lowest last week. They don't own enough stock to do it, we're all holding it or buying it when they try to ladder. As long as everyone keeps holding they cannot push the price down enough to get out of their hole, and each day the are stuck in it they bleed money, and at some point will have to buy their way out of the hole.

 TLDR; they are paying big money everyday as long as we HOLD. It'costing them billions. They use any tactic to make us think they have left so that we leave and tank the stock price so they make money. THAT IS NOT TRUE. They are still in and we are costing them billions. HOLD

Gentlemen, I'm new here but I'm a mathematician at heart (I'm a big fan of my username, google it) and didn't had much time at my disposal to spend on reddit


Their strategy is this: They want us to believe they are out when in fact THEY ARE NOT. We have them by the balls. They want us to believe the war is over so that we leave and tank the stock price down. 


That's why Friday was not that much of a brutal day, to make it seem they have no reason to stir up waters because they are out, that they left. Late Thursday they have LIED they are out. (using places like cnbc and not an official press release that would have them liable). This is their narrative, they try anything to make you give up.


When we give up (NEVER!) is when they will make money, DO NOT GIVE THEM YOUR MONEY, STAY HERE, that's the reason they keep shorting or ""doubling down"" because they believe we will go home and they also want to make it seem like the virality of the movement is over which is not true, it's just getting started.


They think we are cowards, thugs, scared weak sheep, gulible. WHICH WE ARE NOT. And that's how we will further be painted if you give up and go home. DON'T GO HOME. THIS IS YOUR NEW HOME. 


I believe everyone one of you, as you have demonstrated everyday and especially Thursday, is here to stay and make these evil psychopaths PAY and PAY BIG, Remember this is our mission, not to make a few bucks but that we LOVE THE STOCK. We HOLD for as long as we need. As you've seen DeepFuckingValue is DIAMOND BALLS DEEP IN. 


BECAUSE WE ARE IN LOVE WITH THE STOCK. 


Desperately they tried to make some money Thursday and succeeded by using evil and illegal tactics, by doubling down on the short then closing robinhood and tanking the market. They make money when the stock goes down BUT IT WILL NOT GO DOWN BECAUSE WE HOLD.


But if WE HOLD then it won't go down and THEY WILL PAY EVERY SINGLE DAY. As long as we HOLD then it's costing them big money every single day then the stock price is high and they have to pay those stocks that they shorted.  STAY FOCUSED ON THE MISSION. Do not let yourself distracted and TRUST NOBODY, only this place. Remember this is their strategy, that's why Friday things weren't that brutal, before Friday they have also ""announced"" and lied that their position is over BUT IT IS NOT.  They want us to believe they are out so that we also get out BUT WE WILL NOT because they are still in and we got them by the balls with our diamond hands and they are so desperate. HOLD


TRUST NOBODY, ONLY NUMBERS AND THE MATH IS ON OUR SIDE.

That's why Friday was not that much of a brutal day, to make it seem they have no reason to stir up waters because they are out, that they left. Late Thursday they have LIED they are out. (using places like cnbc and not an official press release that would have them liable). This is their narrative, they try anything to make you give up.


When we give up (NEVER!) is when they will make money, DO NOT GIVE THEM YOUR MONEY, STAY HERE, that's the reason they keep shorting or ""doubling down"" because they believe we will go home and they also want to make it seem like the virality of the movement is over which is not true, it's just getting started.


They think we are cowards, thugs, scared weak sheep, gulible. WHICH WE ARE NOT. And that's how we will further be painted if you give up and go home. DON'T GO HOME. THIS IS YOUR NEW HOME. 


I believe everyone one of you, as you have demonstrated everyday and especially Thursday, is here to stay and make these evil psychopaths PAY and PAY BIG, Remember this is our mission, not to make a few bucks but that we LOVE THE STOCK. We HOLD for as long as we need. As you've seen DeepFuckingValue is DIAMOND BALLS DEEP IN. 


BECAUSE WE ARE IN LOVE WITH THE STOCK. 


Desperately they tried to make some money Thursday and succeeded by using evil and illegal tactics, by doubling down on the short then closing robinhood and tanking the market. They make money when the stock goes down BUT IT WILL NOT GO DOWN BECAUSE WE HOLD.


But if WE HOLD then it won't go down and THEY WILL PAY EVERY SINGLE DAY. As long as we HOLD then it's costing them big money every single day then the stock price is high and they have to pay those stocks that they shorted.  STAY FOCUSED ON THE MISSION. Do not let yourself distracted and TRUST NOBODY, only this place. Remember this is their strategy, that's why Friday things weren't that brutal, before Friday they have also ""announced"" and lied that their position is over BUT IT IS NOT.  They want us to believe they are out so that we also get out BUT WE WILL NOT because they are still in and we got them by the balls with our diamond hands and they are so desperate. HOLD


TRUST NOBODY, ONLY NUMBERS AND THE MATH IS ON OUR SIDE.

>*”The volume is low”*.

What does this mean? The total volume of shares being moved around is LOW. The dips you are seeing are artificial and are NOT due to people selling shares. It’s illegal market manipulation at its finest.

Hedge funders sell their shares to each other at lower and lower bids (by tiny amounts) in rapid succession using bots. This tricks the algorithm into thinking a shit ton of shares are being dumped = the price is shown to go down.

In reality, no one is selling. Hedge funders are just moving shares between each other. If people were actually selling, you’d need at least 10x the volume to bring the price down like that.

So, stop panicking pussies. They’ve been doing this all week. Stop staring at your screen and watching every dollar movement. Go for a walk without a phone, have a shower, damn have breakfast if you haven’t already. Share this info to other newbie traders

Info of volume can be see in level 2 market data, found free on this stream:[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQbg\_WU-0AQ&ab\_channel=StocksBigPlays](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQbg_WU-0AQ&ab_channel=StocksBigPlays)

- shares are temporarily down, we expected this, BUT conditions are not dissipating 

 “”Still, the blood bath for short-sellers may be over as it seems Reddit traders have switched their focus to silver.”

- haha it’s really just not over. We haven’t switched our focus, don’t let them trick you into thinking we have. Idk what else to say there

EXPLANATION FOR WORRIED NEWBIE TRADERS 👇🏻

”The volume is low”.

What does this mean? The total volume of shares being moved around is LOW. The dips you are seeing are artificial and are NOT due to people selling shares. It’s illegal market manipulation at its finest.

Hedge funders sell their shares to each other at lower and lower bids (by tiny amounts) in rapid succession using bots. This tricks the algorithm into thinking a shit ton of shares are being dumped = the price is shown to go down.

In reality, no one is selling. Hedge funders are just moving shares between each other. If people were actually selling, you’d need at least 10x the volume to bring the price down like that.

So, stop panicking pussies. They’ve been doing this all week. Stop staring at your screen and watching every dollar movement. Go for a walk without a phone, have a shower, damn have breakfast if you haven’t already. Share this info to other newbie traders

Info of volume can be see in level 2 market data, found free on this stream:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQbg_WU-0AQ&ab_channel=StocksBigPlays

WHAT'S TO STOP THEM FROM DOING THIS FOREVER?

Well, unlike us retarded diamond handed monkeys, everyone with a short position has to pay daily interest on their positions to their broker.

**EXPLANATION FOR WORRIED NEWBIE TRADERS 👇🏻**

>*”The volume is low”*.

What does this mean? The total volume of shares being moved around is LOW. The dips you are seeing are artificial and are NOT due to people selling shares. It’s illegal market manipulation at its finest.

Hedge funders sell their shares to each other at lower and lower bids (by tiny amounts) in rapid succession using bots. This tricks the algorithm into thinking a shit ton of shares are being dumped = the price is shown to go down.

In reality, no one is selling. Hedge funders are just moving shares between each other. If people were actually selling, you’d need at least 10x the volume to bring the price down like that.

Hi Guys,

&#x200B;

Today the SEC data on the failures to deliver just came out for the first half of January. Note that GME has been on the SEC Threshold List since the 8th of December. This list was created by the SEC to make sure they could keep their eyes on abusive naked short-selling, but just like 2008 they're asleep at the wheel. When you short a share, you have to deliver the shares to the buyer within 2 days. If not, it's classed as a failure to deliver and signifies that you sold shares without having them or being able to locate them a.k.a naked short-selling

&#x200B;

I just combed through the data on this (you can go through it yourself and add up the ""GME"" failures to deliver) and the failures to deliver added up to 5,074,937 shares. That's almost 10% of the whole fucking free float. We don't even have the data on what's happened after the first half of January, but I assume it must be higher because of the even greater price spikes we have seen.

&#x200B;

This is FUCKING CRIMINAL and all of these idiots deserve to go to jail for what they've done. They got their hand caught in the cookie jar shorting 140% of the free float of GME, then halt trading at the same time across the world and then tank to get the paper hands to sell. Now they're pushing the narrative that we're focusing on silver which is complete BULLSHIT. All the posts calling for silver are 2 day old Citadel/Melvin shill accounts, DO NOT LISTEN TO THEM.

&#x200B;

The facts are on our side. The hedge funds cannot suddenly change the rules of the game so the SEC can't report failures to deliver. The fact that they most of them don't have ANY SHARES to actually back their short position, I think that the short interest is still heavily underreported (don't listen to S3 or any of the sellouts, check Finwiz). We're still at around 122%. They literally cannot cover, and this is the thing none of the media shills are talking about. Even if they wanted to, they couldn't cover. This is why GME has been on the SEC Threshold List since December. This is pure naked short-selling.

&#x200B;

So, continue holding. DON'T LET ANYONE TELL YOU THAT WE DON'T HAVE THEM BY THE FUCKING BALLS. WE DO, AND IT'S TIME TO PAY THE PIPER.

6547,CEO," **Note: I updated my above post and this one to add more clarity**

It is extremely hard to explain the finer details but there's [a video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpWzOjB8qtU) by the old CEO of Overstock that goes into that level of detail.

If I understand everything correctly....

When a large number of these IOU/FTD shares are created maliciously (""counterfeits"", which I can imagine a lot of these FTD shares are), the stock price collapses and you end up with a Bear Stearns situation.  Stock goes to zero.  But if they are created maliciously, and the stock goes up, then these ""counterfeit"" shares have the opposite effect.  The counterfeit shares have to become real (they are now effectively IOUs), which boosts the price of the stock.  And if people are holding, supply is dwindling, but demand is staying stable at least, then this will push the price up even more.

It takes time for these counterfeit shares to clear, so it delays what's actually happening, potentially by days.  So we might literally be rich right now and we don't know it yet.

Again, do your own research and come to your own conclusions, these are just my opinions and speculations, and maybe I am even wrong.  This is simply how I am understanding the situation.",JB4GDI,141,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lab86a/gme_discussion_thread_for_february_1_2021_part_3/gln5hth/,0.043,0.794,0.163,0.9805

6657,DD,"  *Psych major here*: the problem is that this sub is actually a bona-fide subculture, and people misusing artifacts, cultural memes, lingo, etc. is slightly mocking in tone and is creating in-group defensiveness and identity confusion. 
 Also, people who are slightly above average in technical knowledge of the market/intelligence using ironic self descriptions such as ""retard"" or ""autist"" who have made important financial decisions based on DD but missed the mark or otherwise made a poor decision that actually produced a profit (i.e savant) helps the community bond. 

 People of average to slightly lower than average technical knowledge/intelligence referring to themselves and others as ""retarded"" or ""autistic"" takes on an uncomfortable tone.
