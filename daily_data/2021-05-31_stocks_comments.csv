0,VC," the main problem with the Tech market in 1999 was that there were a lot of new companies which all made great promises, but not enough people actually understood most of them.   
there were a lot of ""cool kids"" that had ""amazing tech"", but couldn´t tell you how they would make money with their tech to save their lifes. 

its the main reason today that VC and investment into startups has dramtically changed. the tech itself is rarely revolutionary. but you have to present a strong business case. 

back in the days the main goal was ""to get big"" and yet nobody knw how to really achive that. 

the amount of cash that got burned at marketing events, fairs, press releases etc was insane. yet there was no real revenue. 

I got a nice anecdote from the 90´s. 

a former boss of mine had a company that basically offered a platform for artist to upload and market their songs. a very early version of something like spotify if you will.   
yet , only a fraction of the population had internet access that was able to deliver the necessary bandwith.   
audio tools and equipment to convert music into MP3´s was in its infancy. codec technology wasn´t as refined. 

 and on top of that: a new fledging artist that doesn´t have all this surely cannot afford to pay for a service like this. 

the idea was amazing. yet the time was just not right.",psykikk_streams,825,/r/stocks/comments/noyx2t/did_people_know_the_tech_sector_was_overvalued/h02imq8/,0.031,0.801,0.169,0.9896
1,TV," Yes and no.  As a broker at the time it was very clear, especially when there was TV commercials on CNBC advertising the STOCK!  I’m serious, the problem was the shares were way overpriced but they kept going higher.  A co. would announce a 2-1 stock split and go up $30, I told clients “the shares are way too high but they keep going higher” on the flip side so many clients/avg folks truly 100% believed they were cheap even at 300 x sales, or because “eyeball views” were up.  It was very frustrating for people who studied or understood how markets work, it threw all that under a bus.  Hope that helped, snd btw, if I NEVER hear the term “whisper number” again I’ll be very happy",Thestockbroker22,22,/r/stocks/comments/noyx2t/did_people_know_the_tech_sector_was_overvalued/h02x46d/,0.063,0.783,0.154,0.9299
2,NYT," The .com bubble popping is a little harder to explain but most of it comes down to tech illiteracy (which even people who say they're tech literature still don't understand this shit).

There was barely any e-commerce at the time of the dot com bubble.  The secure method of doing transactions online with a credit card wasn't invented until the mid 00s.

Most of the internet was powered by advertisements from real world businesses.  In traditional advertising you are given an idea of exposure and so you have a billboard and perhaps 10,000 people will see it a day.... you'll be able to figure out that it costs $0.50 per person to see that billboard.  TV is even more efficient, you might be paying $0.10 per person viewing.

Online advertisements promised that you would pay one tenth of a penny per person viewing your advertisement (and it was all banner advertisements and pop ups, no videos in pre-broadband days).  The demand was so high for online advertising that advertisers were paying extreme rates to attract pages to advertise on.

Today Google gives an average of $0.30 CPM (Clicks Per Thousand) and people are pretty happy to live off of that.  But at the time you could get anywhere from $8 to $40 CPM.  Just a small website with less than 1,000 regular viewers could make anywhere from $1000-$40,000/month (had a website, made $19,000/month off of it).

CPM was a metric in which people would get paid for every single person viewing the page and more for people who click on it.  The average offered was based on your clickthrough percentages.  How did I make my money?  I had a click bot clicking on the banners, closing them, refreshing the page and then clicking again.

Since there was no e-commerce all advertising dollars were coming from real world businesses who didn't understand that their business was not getting advertised to people in their area, to individual users, or on effective websites.  Once a NYT article on the advertising bubble came out it sort of ruined it for everyone involved in this kind of operation.  A lot of these advertising platforms went belly up which meant that the revenue source for a lot of these websites also went belly up.

Google spent hundreds of millions of dollars developing advertising technology that could restore consumer confidence in online advertising.

I think there's a bit of a tech bubble right now.  But I think the information is different.  An investor in Geocities had no way of knowing that the entire revenue source for the company would be gone in a matter of seven days after the publication of a single article convincing real world companies they're being swindled.",garlicroastedpotato,18,/r/stocks/comments/noyx2t/did_people_know_the_tech_sector_was_overvalued/h03574t/,0.042,0.869,0.089,0.9761

4,MSFT," 1999 was less of a “tech” bubble and more of a .com bubble, so you really can’t compare MSFT to what happened.  Everyone was investing in unprofitable .com businesses that had never made a dime (FOMO anyone?) These are companies that really did not have an actual product, but only provided a service, unlike MSFT who had an actual physical product.  As long as banks kept lending to the .com businesses, they were able to operate, but were constantly hemorrhaging money.  The banks stopped lending, which started many businesses to go under.

Several companies like RIDE, WKHS, FSR, and NKLA have been exposed as unprofitable at best and outright frauds at worst. Tesla itself has “only” lost 30% which makes it practically a winner.

lol, yes. So many vaporware EV vehicles to be released 'soon'. So many of them, you'll never see more than a few computer generated models of it, or *maybe* a few demonstration vehicles if you're lucky.

Even Tesla may be guilty of this. The Cybertruck is *still* basically nothing more than a 1-off concept car and *still* has no firm release date planned. I have my questions about the 2nd gen Roadster as well -- I see a lot of hype ... but I don't see a lot of Roadsters rolling out of factories. (Meanwhile, they're doing things that are unpopular with consumers -- like moving all controls to the screen and locking car features behind a subscription -- and their build quality is still questionable.)",SprinklesFancy5074,38,/r/stocks/comments/noyx2t/did_people_know_the_tech_sector_was_overvalued/h03160j/,0.068,0.835,0.097,0.6757

38,AI," I'm solidly in the ""AI go foom"" camp and think the coming explosion of automation and intelligence in general is shockingly close and will happen on time scales that make even the most optimistic AI proponent's head spin. 

Like, there is this sense from some that an AI will be created and then a few days later it will learn enough to be on par with a human child, and then a few more days and it's as smart as an average adult human and then a month later it's super intelligent. But in reality it's actually just a handful of nanoseconds between childlike intelligence and god-tier superintelligence that takes control of literally everything (for better or worse is still up in the air) 

It's going to be an interesting decade. People worrying about what to do about climate change, and I'm over here worrying about all the  life in this galaxy getting grey goo'd by a rouge AI that humanity unleashes because we were reckless with it's development...

Tesla is a decade ahead of all competitors in the development of self-driving AI.  This is not an insignificant lead.  It may be the case that in as little as ten years ride share companies such as Uber and Lyft will have bought massive numbers of Tesla automobiles and set up huge charging and holding stations near population centers.  This would allow people to be able to summon a self-driving car with their smart phone within a few minutes for very little.  If this were to come to pass I would expect individual car ownership to approach zero.

I think that the broad picture of that out come is not only highly likely, but inevitable.  The major players may be different but Tesla is perfectly positioned to take advantage of that future eventuality.  And at the current moment there is no viable competitor to Tesla.

76,OR," from what I gathered, they sell off about 4% / year. the rest generates enough to make up for that.

the most prevalent strategy I encountered is to calculate how much you think you would need per year.

then see how much capital you would need to generate this income by avg % returns (like in an etf) or dividends.  
this approach has the goal of preserving capital for as long as possible and maybe even after you are gone. 

  
OR you do the same calculation and then just try to guess your avg life expectancy . then see how much capital you need to take your estimated amount of money out until you croak.  
this leaves nothing for any relatives that are too dumb and too lazy to save money for themselves and are just waiting for you to pass on that pot of gold you worked so hard for.

82,UK," As far as I know, ""US listed"" just means stocks available on a US market. Tons of non-US stocks are listed in the US.

In the S&P 500:

12 companies are headquartered in Ireland

6 are in the UK

3 are in the Netherlands

3 are in Switzerland

1 is in Bermuda

So a total of 5% of companies, and likely to continue growing.

China taking that level of market share is very, very much an 'if'  and plenty of western companies are already present in or are expanding into foreign markets, up to and including China. Depending on how international tensions shake out, I wouldn't be surprised to start seeing Chinese companies entering US indices, either. Edit: There are a few Chinese companies in the NASDAQ 100 already.

To me, it isn't worth the lower returns and higher fees offered by all-world or ex-US funds in the meantime, and if China does attain that level of prominence on a global level or the US falls from grace that hard, there are probably going to be bigger things to worry about than the value of your retirement account.",Asinus_Sum,9,/r/stocks/comments/np3lgq/which_global_etf_would_you_use_if_you_would_park/h034b98/,0.063,0.879,0.058,-0.0114

92,CCL," When I got into CCL I got in at 12.35.  Then they had a couple of boats floating around out there with bodies on them that nobody would let come into port.  The price dropped further, and I bought more at $8.15.  I think this is kind of an example why yoloing in a situation like this is bad.  If you throw all your money in at once, you can't buy more if it keeps dropping. Anyhow, carnival is trading for near $30 Now.  So yes, I did buy when I thought we were near the bottom and missed. So it was an example of trying to catch a falling knife. But when it bounced off the bottom, I bought more...and as of today I'm up 171%.  When I bought more carnival, I also bought into Royal Caribbean at that time... It's up 221% since I bought it.

When I looked at Boeing after the two engines came apart in flight...prepandemic it was trading at about $350, and it was trading about $250, I bought a few shares. It dropped, I bought a few shares, it dropped, I bought a few shares. This was all recent, and now it's back up to trading at a little under $250, and I'm up five and a half percent.  So I missed the bottom with my first purchase, but just kept buying whenever I had expendable cash.  I actually kind of wished it stayed down longer, allowing me to buy more when it was down around $222.  I expect it to be trading at $350 in a year or two.

Rolls-Royce ( RYCEY) is sitting at the bottom, at least where there seems to be a lot of resistance, and has been there for a while. They expect to go cash positive second half of this year.  I don't have very much money in it. Whenever there's a few extra dollars sitting in my brokerage account I buy more shares of Rolls-Royce. I expect to see it double over the next 3 years or so as commercial air travel picks up.  They have a bid in for the re-engining of the B-52.

160,COST," both are overvalued due to the covid-hangover. I don't se how low-margin retail chains can justify this high of PE. It's not like Costco can open 50% more store every year for the next 5 years.

PE of COST has been climbing precipitously from 10 (2010) to now around 38 while its profit margin has stayed flat since inception. This is a screaming ""NO"" and the elevated price is more a result of retail investor piling in to me.

161,AMC," I'm confused as well. 

Did you ""short"" a stonk (ie. did you sell it without owning it, like hedge funds do?) . Assuming this is what you did -- 

What you are asking us is how to hedge your bets, which is also reducing profits. But, you didn't want to hedge your bet, you wanted max profits, right? 

If you aren't familiar with options, you really should not be selling shorts, as you can lose a lot of money. 

So you shorted GME or AMC and it went up? 

You didn't put in a stop loss to start with?

You don't know how to enter a limit order? 

You didn't buy an option to hedge your bet and limit your losses? 

You didn't try out how these things work with fake money aka ""paper trading"" first? 

Easy solution. Just go to your brokers home page and login. Go to your account profile, then type in the search ""Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, B, A"", and your money will be back. Easy peasy. 

In reality, you can buy a call option, so if it goes up more, you have the profit of the call option. Or, just ""buy to close"" right now, and take your loss as a lesson. Learn about all of the options (and options) and how to calculate max loss. Max loss on a ""short"" is ""unlimited"".

164,AMC, I actually don’t know if I’m correct then... I know that it isn’t always possible to purchase an ITM call. AMC $2 call for December 17 has 0 volume and 4 open interest.

165,AMC," Im not against amc, I made some money on it. But a LOT of new investors are yoloing based off the idea that they are 100% predicting an infinite shirt squeeze. An infinite SS CAN happen, but the odds of 4 happening within the same year (GME AMC BB NOK) as is being spread is essentially 0. You are a new investor if you are asking about selling a call.

When a short seller has to cover they have some time. Let's say that a huge HF has a huge short position and they get margin called, they have the capital to spread it out, they don't have to cover that second. 


Secondly you should read the room, this sub is about investing, not gambling.

By all means yolo on AMC but be smart about it. It is not hitting 1. 50, 80, even possibly 100, but 1k is not realistic.",iWushock,1,/r/stocks/comments/norpgc/wayyyy_otm_calls/h036usj/,0.0,0.92,0.08,0.9022
