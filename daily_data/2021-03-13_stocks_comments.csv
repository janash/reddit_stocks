I can write all those same articles.  ""Hey, if you put $5 in Microsoft in 1975 you'd have a billion dollars today.""  Almost all of these ""advice gurus"" just tell you to put money in the too big to fail like google, apple and amazon then you do, you make a little money then they say ""see, we're brilliant, send us more subscription money"" and you do.

So here's the ""$10,000 scam"" they run. They always give you like 5 stocks;  3 or 4 are behemoths like Amazon that can't lose, 1 or 2 are questionable companies nobody's heard of that might be on to something, might not be.  1 is let's say, Chesapeake Energy that goes bankrupt and is total loss.  But the others like Amazon, Google, Tesla and Netflix.  The 3,000 percent gain of Netflix alone eases the total loss of another. So they say ""see, you made money.""  

This is how financial advisors work, too, because they can get sued, lose their license and even face criminal charges for ""bad advice"" so they only put you in GM, Ford, Amazon and Exxon. Those are good companies but you aren't getting the 20,000 percent gains at Ford.

91,BB, Someone else asked this question and I don't personally sell calls for less than I paid for the shares. He specifically was saying he paid $20 per share so I was saying a person could sell weekly calls at $20. In order for that call to be executed the price would have to go from $12 to over $20 in one week so worst case scenario he gets paid the same price he paid + the premium. As of the time I wrote this a $20 call on BB expiring March 19th sells for $13 (the price of options is calculated per share so in this case $0.13 but each contract is 100 shares =$13 per contract). which doesn't seem like much but over the course of a year adds up.

118,BB," because people seem to be asking a lot of basic questions and some of this stuff can be confusing to people, for example how options are priced. I remember when I first talked to my brother about selling covered calls he said ""but thats only $0.15"" and I had to explain that the price is per share and each contract is 100 shares. $13 does seem like much but if a person purchased 100 shares of BB for $1200 and sold weekly calls at a $20 strike price for $13 that is $676 a year on a $1200 investment. The person who originally mentioned purchasing shares at $20 obviously would have paid $2000 for 100 shares but even then a $600 annual profit  on a $2000 investment is pretty good to me.

120,BB," If the strike price of a call is above the share price, it most likely won't be executed. So the option expires worthless, meaning the buyer lost the premium and the seller keeps it.

So as a example, you sell a call at a $20 strike at a premium of $0.50 that expires March 26th. At the end of the day on the 26th, BB is trading at $17. The buyer doesn't exercise their option to buy the seller's 100 shares at $20, so it expires and you keep the $0.50 premium, which $0.50 * 100, means you earn $50.

The seller can buy to close their sold option before the expiration date to avoid selling shares at the strike or to secure profits.",Ihavenotseen,1,/r/stocks/comments/m3sjn7/bb_this_weeks_recap_3122021_technical_analysis/gqrv8xm/,0.091,0.818,0.091,0.25

Because the probabilities are set in its favour.

But it can be a very good tool to pinpoint trades that are bad and should be avoided.

It does not mean that you will 100% make money if you buy when it's below the Bollinger bands or if the stochastic is below 20%. It just eliminates a few red flags and points at a potential opportunity that you should further investigate.

203,TA," Yes it is. Maybe not 100% but probably 99%. So much BS that it is more harmful than good. It's just another religion that humans created.

&#x200B;

The reason TA is BS is simply this: The instantaneous value of a stock is essentially stochastic but TA is heavily dependent on the instantaneous value. E.g., If there is a spike then some TA will grab that spike, but the spike is imaginary. It could be totally different without the underlying fundamentals changing at all. Basically if S(t) is the stock price then there is a stochastic element, e.g., e(t) and the stock price people get is S(t) + e(t). e(t) is significantly large that conclusions drawn about the underlying value is going to have significant error, e.g., 10% or more.  Basically all the little random movements a stock makes is error that will throw off any analysis that doesn't smooth out the data. TA should be done, at the very least, on a moving average... yet it isn't.

&#x200B;

All that is ignoring the fact that stock prices are essentially non-stationary and memoryless(or very short term memory). 1. A stocks value can change on a dime changing the entire dynamics). If you treat it as stationary then you will get screwed when those changes happen(which could happen every stock trade if someone is manipulating the stock or fundamentals). 2. A stock's value 10 years ago is virtually no indication of how a stock's value is today. Ok, then what is the time when it will indicate? 5 years? 2 years? 2 months? 1 day? How far back can we go in time to use that stocks price to predict the current or future price? Well, probably a few days max. It's like weather, it is impossible to predict it to any accuracy more than a few minutes head. Yes, some patterns can be drawn for global analysis but there is an innate chaotic aspect to these types of phenomena that prevent true prediction.

208,TA," I'll admit I roll my eyes when I see somebody rambling about a cup and handle or some kind of bullshit like that.  It's easy to dismiss when you people overstating its relevance.   
 But I will say this...  Many institutional trades are executed by computers.  Obviously these processes are controlled by algorithms.  Algorithmic ""thought"" does tend to form patterns.  Patterns that replicate due to the core rules of the algorithms themselves.  So generally I agree and I wouldn't base all of my DD on TA.

In my experience; the independent use of TA yields mixed results. When coupled with other factors it has been more successful. For me it works best in a 3-5 week time frame.

This is why breakouts are a thing. You’re telling me it’s 100% coincidence, that when an obvious established trendline breaks, just *magically* an increase in volume and volatility follow?

TA is going to give you a plan for each scenario, whether the market goes up or down. Its literally all the information of the entire history of how the stock trades. If a stock is at 63 and a year long trendline as support at 61. You don’t know what happens with the market tomorrow. But you do know if we go red and the 61 support holds a lot of other traders will buy. 

TA tells you if you’re buying a stock that has momentum behind it or if you’re buying a stock that has a ton of winners already looking to sell. TA tells you where the volume is, at what prices, if you see monster volume at a base followed by a run up and a drop off of volume and RSI divergence? Yea TA is telling you that momentum is dying off and you’re likely to get a better price later on at some point. 

If you think TA is nonsense I think you’ve never bothered to take the time to study it. It’s just market data, not magic. And market data is useful when you’re actively trading in that exact same market.

245,BB," I agree and disagree. I would say most of TA is voodoo witchcraft, or whatever you want to call it. But there are some components that technically fit into TA that are really critical to know.

I'll give some examples of important ones:

1) **Option chains**

Most stocks do not have a significant number of options at different strike levels. The ones that typically do these days are the ones that get popular and then are deemed as 'meme stocks'. Because of the increase of public focus, more people pile in thus the stock becomes volatile, particularly when the company that is being invested is a smaller market cap company or has good potential, but has issues in the balance sheet. Thus, the influx of longs will also produce a number of shorts, and voila, volatility. If you can figure out when a stock is going to become volatile, or which will stay volatile, it is possible to use TA to find out when to buy, which can make you a lot of money.

A popular example is GME. This is not just a popular example, but really a rather unparalleled example, a stock that has 10s of thousands of options at 'nice number' strikes, such as 150, 200, 250, 300, etc. Earlier this week (or was it last?), I personally *knew* about the large number of options at 150. I knew that just based on the math alone, the TA that is, that if GME crosses 150, it would probably go straight to 180 or even 200 within the day. So I woke up at 4am PST bought 100 shares and within a few hours I had 25% returns. Just took some investigation into option chains and understanding the technical side of MMs hedging options

*I'm really not a TA guy, FYI. But I do use a few TA tools and ignore the rest*

2) **Insider buys and sells**

Perhaps this is borderline FA and TA, but I'm going to call this TA for this reason. Sometimes a stock is undervalued, and for whatever reason, it just sits being undervalued for a long time. If an insider, or an exec, starts buying shares at a certain price, or if multiple people start buying shares, that's an insider floor. This usually means that this price is a *really* nice place to be, because they know a lot more than you do, and if they're happy with that price point, then so am I. For instance, a number of insiders bought shares of BB right at the 10.00 price, creating a floor for a little while at 10. Ultimately, it dipped below and came back, but either way, that little piece of TA tells me that anytime BB gets near 10, it's a good buying opportunity. Of course, I like the fundamentals of BB a lot more than just going off the TA, but it does help reinforce your own opinions.

3) **200MA vs 50MA**

This one can be significant, and sometimes it's not so significant. It really depends on how often these averages cross and how strongly they have crossed. Finding a company that actually reverses it's business outlook from a negative one to a positive one is rare, and if you can identify a company that might be trending in a better direction, look more into that company! This was the initial thesis behind DFV's look into GME, and in fact, a lot of popular stocks on Reddit have been focusing on turn around stories. It can make you a pretty penny

There's not a lot else that I really think holds a lot of worth in TA, but that's just my opinion. I think everyone should have different values on how to value stocks and interpret how a company will do. There's no need for solidarity!

It’s not a precise science. There’s wisdoms that are required as well to understand the charts, and many can’t fully explain it or codify the theories into an exact science. Just like with any highly specialized and lucrative scientific trade- you can’t just put a recipe on it and make millions.

277,TA," I'll admit I'm a skeptic by nature and my distaste for it more than likely stems from that. From what I've seen, TA is clearly the most monetized aspect of ""stock market courses"" and it all comes across as very disingenuous and a big scam. People new to the stock market love TA because once they start to learn it they think they've cracked the code of the stock market and are now capable of predicting movement and making decisions but in reality it's just fake confidence and holds no real value. All I have to do is look at any of these stock market youtube channels and see that 99% of them focus on technical analysis because that's what gives people confidence in someone which leads to support, donations, etc. and that's what reassures me that it's overplayed to get people to buy into them. Do you really think someone who claims to understand TA and is able to use it to effectively make money would spend their time making youtube videos on it? Why the fuck wouldn't they just employ and keep it to themselves? It's because it's extremely easily monetizable and can easily manipulate an audience.

311,TA," Alright, let's use a very simple ""low-hanging-fruit"" example to prove that TA can have added probabilistic value in public opinion, once we've done that, we can try to figure out where are its limits:

Say you have a bearish market that is nearing a strong support line, the stock/FX pair seems oversold and that same support line happens to be a whole number, say 1.5000
Looking at these three signals, you can project that a reversal might occur in the next few candles.
So you set it up and wait for a confirmation, if and when you get that confirmation, you along with any other guy that followed the same TA logic are likely to enter the trade and jack up the price (thus fulfilling your initial projection).

Getting that signal-combo doesn't confirm your guaranteed future earnings, but if you only took trades with those 3 signals lined up and with correct risk-reward ratios you would be profitable over time.
Not because these are clear rules about the market, but because these are clear rules about the trading community's consensus on TA.
If the vast majority of traders believed that 10 consecutive bearish candles are a great signifier of another 10 bearish candles coming, then that would start occuring more in the market.

To try and jam the same concept in different terms:
Comparing a roullete round to a market decision based on TA is false. It is false because a roullete round has defined probabilities. If you played 100 rounds, each one would have the same defined probability regardless of the last round's outcome.
If the above TA example holds true, and I believe it does, then TA can affect the probability and make a scenario less or more probable, making every decision round unequal to its predecessor.

320,WTI," I started investing in January 2020 when I inherited some money. Of course, COVID hit two months later, and I was one of the scared sheep that pulled their money out at the bottom just before JPow turned on the printer. Bottom of the bottom. March 23rd. Who says you can't time the market? :/

Realizing my screwup, I waited 30 days and put it back in, avoiding the wash sale and harvesting some loss, and made a big move into oil commodity ETFs when WTI went to zero (I'm an engineer and I get how that market works, so I knew it was a big opportunity).

I realized a total loss of about $50k, but was able to harvest about $40k in my taxable, and ultimately won big with the oil investments (held long to avoid short term gains), so it turned out to be a very good year in the end.

In hindsight I wish that 1) I didn't freak out and pull my money when the market crashed and 2) I wish I didn't put all of my money into the market in January 2020, as I had no cash to take advantage of the dip. If I had it to do all over again I think I would have just put 2/3rd in an index, held the remainder in cash, and would have left the index investment alone and push cash into a buying opportunity.

Live and learn. I'm starting to cash out my oil investment that I had in my IRAs, and will start moving out the rest this summer to avoid the short term gains, and I'm basically trying to set up my portfolio such that I can DCA in from my paycheck, allocating some to long investments and cash which I can utilize to take advantage of dips.",Mysterious-Gas-1973,22,/r/stocks/comments/m3shni/how_much_have_you_lost_due_to_lessons/gqqs6vz/,0.068,0.833,0.099,0.9428

323,GME," I started with 20k in my account. Was up 5k mid-February trading stocks since late October. This is even with losing $1300 on GME. Good time to be trading. Basically everything was a winner. I didn't do the right research on companies, but stuff generally went up.

Then tech stocks tanked, and I was worried about a crash. I cashed out with net +$144 last week, because I wanted to at least be net positive. I've been cautiously trading a couple things this past week. Now at +$450 again.

I don't regret it. I didn't know what I was doing before. Just getting lucky on speculative stuff. Or I could buy any dip and it would bounce back. Since the beginning of NASDAQ moving to correction, I have learned about P/E, options, bond yields, futures, leveraged and inverse ETFs, and technical levels.

329,CSX," **The Lesson of not doing anything at all.**

I worked a 100% travel job, which did not typically have online connectivity.  I had saved up about $20,000, kept 10,000 in savings and put the other $10,000 in an SEP account with Merrill Edge.  I was doing alot of investor education online, but was afraid to jump in. I didn't want to make a mistake not understanding the risk. In the meantime, I did not have internet for a month at a time.

I finally settled on a mutual fund and put $2,500 in, but it took me 4 months to get to this point. I watched it go up, up, and up fairly quickly. Another 8 months goes buy and I finally feel confident enough to buy more. I spread the rest out to QQQ, 1 other mutual fund, and I bought a stake in CSX and JPM as my first sole stock purchases.

Everything did well for about 6 months and then the market simmered for about 8 months before continuing to do well.

I use Merrill Edge as my broker and it generates a nice graph that compares all of your account holding (including non-invested cash) and how it stacks up against an index.

Years later....If I had just put it all into a simple S&P 500 index ETF initially, without delay, I would be up 180.6%. Instead my initial $10k is up 131.6% from that 1 year delay. I am missing out on gains from compounding interest to this day.

Now this is only from my initial $10k, so I am only out about **$5k** from this. But that was an easy $5k that could be making more money into the future. In 30 years that will be **$38k** if I get an average annual gain of 7%.

7 years later I've saved up more more and my gains in the market are $200k and I've better learned how to mitigate risks and can take the risks of staying ahead of the market and get better gains appropriately.

&#x200B;

Don't make mistakes caused from FOMO in aggressive or risky trades, but **fear doing nothing** with your money.

I would always default to a solid index ETF and then if you are purposefully taking a strategy to remove money from the market to time it, that is fine, but that is an investment decision doing something. Don't do nothing.

354,ATH," I've only dabbled in investing at the beginning of 2018, only putting in 10k as markets were at ATH. I had the brilliant idea to time the market so 60k sat in my brokerage in cash earning 0% interest so i can buy in cheap. The kicker is i didnt even watch the market so i missed the 2018 december pull back completely. Then march 2020 came but instead of buying i instead bought leveraged inverse ETFs at the literally bottom of the market on march 23rd and because of sunk cost fallacy I did not go long at all, I kept waiting for the market to crash again so my inverse etf can recover and I'm still in cash to this day. The inverse ETF i only sold last month at a 80% loss for -12k. To add insult to injury, I also had the brilliant idea to sell my parent's investments worth 100k+ when the market recovered cause i thought it was irrational when COVID was still raging. So now  their investments are sitting in cash too.

I have since missed out on over 70k - 80k of gains plus the 12k loss split between me and my parents by this point which is equivalent of 2-3 years of my salary and it is killing me inside. Seeing the recent market melt ups is just a kick in the balls, every massive green day just makes me sicker and sicker to my stomach. I know i shouldn't try to time the market again but i'm still being affected by sunk cost fallacy, i just can't get myself to buy in now when everything has run up so much so fast.

355,HD," I’m new and just working with a small account I can afford to lose. But feel like I learned an important lesson the other week, lost about $700 on HD Calls:

Did some homework on Home Depot and was feeling pretty confident that it would spike a bit and then fall for a couple weeks around their earnings report late Feb. Plan was to wait for the jump up, then buy a put to ride the post earnings sell off down close to the bottom. 
Well I didn’t see the little spike I was expecting, instead it fell at market open pretty hard, so I impulsively bought a call to ride that little spike back up. The spike happened, I was up $10/share and still expected it to keep going. It fell again. I doubled down on the call, waiting for the “real spike.” And then realized that the spike was over. So at that point I’m holding 2 call options instead of my planned put option, as I watch my original prediction come true and the stock falls for two weeks. My calls expired OTM. 
Two things I learned:  
1) trust my homework, but don’t make up new plans on the fly if things aren’t happening exactly as I expect. Either stick to the plan or don’t get in at all. Don’t make hasty decisions
2) Know ahead of time where to exit your options. If I had a set profit amount to take, I’d have sold and taken a profit, but instead I just kept letting it ride without any real plan to sell. I also now have a deal with myself to sell an option if it falls to 50% of what I paid for it. Better to take a 50% loss than sit waiting and hoping the stock magically climbs back up.",trophyfrank,1,/r/stocks/comments/m3shni/how_much_have_you_lost_due_to_lessons/gqt7kxt/,0.025,0.866,0.109,0.9704
356,GME," I bought my first stocks in GME this week in an over-leveraged CFD account and stupidly left very little money for my margin. I put $400 in and watched it go up to $2000. In my boneheaded high of gaining so much profit, I decided to buy another 5 shares at $320, literally minutes before the massive sell-off happened. Forgetting to set my stop loss meant all my earnings went straight into the debt of the shares I bought at $320 (The account was leveraged 1:5 and I had very little money to cover my losses)

I'm 18 and $2000 is a lot of money for me. watching such a large sum of money disappear in minutes didn't feel great. I've learned that trading with borrowed money is a pretty bad idea. I know that at the end of the day it was my own greed that cost me that 2 grand.",finbm,1,/r/stocks/comments/m3shni/how_much_have_you_lost_due_to_lessons/gqtd095/,0.129,0.76,0.111,-0.4434

I already didn’t believe in buying weeklies ever, I call them scratch-offs, but it was mid GME height and I was up 386K on Wednesday and was certain the stock would hit 500 by Friday.

I even told my friends the only way these weeklies fail is if they cheat or an environmental/systemic change happens.

Well... it did. Options contracts don’t care about the why, they expire worthless if their terms aren’t worth anything. The 2 contracts I bought for 5K each that were “guaranteed” to be worth 4X that at least did not care about long rambles about the DTC. They simply expired worthless.

I learnt my lesson. If I buy options, they’re long dated and not on a timer. Still a gamble, but they can hold value more effectively when theta is at 0",whateverathrowaway00,1,/r/stocks/comments/m3shni/how_much_have_you_lost_due_to_lessons/gqts2n5/,0.1,0.732,0.168,0.8761
360,NKLA," Hm. Good question. 

When you mean mistakes, do you mean selling at a loss or missing out on potential gains? Or both? 

If by missing out on potential gains, I’d say I’ve missed out on up around $150k in the last year. The most recent and most painful being ZM, PLTR, NKLA and SNAP. 

I looked at ZM back in March. I’m in school. I knew everyone was switching to ZM. I was thinking about putting $35,000 into it. I convinced myself people would switch to Skype or Microsoft soon. I was wrong. So that was ~$70k missed. 

PLTR. I made a post about it back when it was $9 a share. Everyone mocked me and said the company would fail. I was going to put $15k into it. I only put in $500 because I listened to some silly internet rascals. So that was about another $30k missed. 

NKLA. The whole company felt like a scam. Normal I don’t do shorts or anything special but in June I was considering taking out short positions in this company. From the day I wanted to do it, until today it’s down 71%. Lots of money missed on that. I don’t know how to calculate short profit because like I said, I don’t do this stuff but with NKLA I was really considering it. 

SNAP. I convinced myself it wasn’t worth it....I was wrong. It ran up a bunch in 2020, thought it was valued too high, kept going up. Thought about jumping on that train back in 2019, still haven’t done it. Worried that as soon as I jump in it’ll come crashing down. I would’ve put $10k in it. So that’s another $30k missed. I still want to put money in SNAP, I might do that on Monday, start to DCA into it but I don’t know. I feel like I’ve missed the train. 

As for companies that have gone south for me. T, XOM, NNN, and WFC. I lost on these because I sold too early. I just didn’t hold them. I bought these stocks because I was told to do when they dropped I didn’t really know why I should hold them.

2) Options have higher returns than stocks and the losses are even higher! So, to counteract, purchase a call option and (sell) put option accordingly. Worse case scenario (if I don’t adhere to lesson one) is that I break even and get to keep my original investment, if I have sense enough to get out by then.

3) Don’t try to get all the money! 🙄There’s money EVERYWHERE, ALL THE TIME! And I wind up with nothing, trying to get everything (like in a money-grab machine.)
4) RESEARCH and STRATEGIZE!!! Have a daily, weekly or monthly strategy. (Strategize according to my life schedule and investment portfolio.)
5) While some DD (due diligence) posts are accurate, most are not and are a scam to ‘pump and dump’ leaving me holding a bag with a hole in it. 😕😖😭
6) Don’t get depressed when I incur major losses! It looks and feels like it’s all over. But IT’S NOT! I will learn my lesson(s), come into some more money to invest, become an experienced investor which will make me a multi-billionaire.
7) Easy does it! When I learn stocks, choose the ones (based on volatility) that suits me, stay on track with my strategy and not ‘put all my eggs in one basket’, I make more money faster and lose less. And I set myself up to be open to other great ‘spur of the moment’ money-making stocks with little to no notice beforehand that they’re about to spike in profit.
8) (Explaining the summary at the end of lesson 7.) ALWAYS have some money set to the side just in case I hear a legitimate word on a great stock about to spike in profit! Or at least have a stock I’m willing to immediately drop in order to snatch a greater profit somewhere else. (And then, adhere to lesson 1....snatch and go!) 🤣

374,GME," The lesson should be “I got lucky, now go forth not expecting another stock like GME ever again.”

You doubled down on a stock that had just tanked over 85% total value. The fact it went up again is pure luck. You could have sat at $50 or worse forever cuz there’s no guarantee this “tech company” revival that Ryan Cohen talks of will pan out. That wasn’t an advisable play because the fundamentals just don’t support the stock, period. Initially, it was a lucky play due to a mistake made by some big billionaire hedge funds. They’ll learn their lesson and next time bury everyone 6 feet under. 

It’ll go down again. That’s my 🌈 🐻 instinct.

#**The Basics**

**Financials** - This is one of the most important things to look for in a company when considering an investment. Things like where they get their revenue and how diversified it is. Look at earnings reports and see if they have consistent EPS growth. A healthy company will show modest income and strong ERs. Apart from the revenue find how much debt they have long term and how much it really equates to that specific industry. Things like market cap and annual sales give you an idea of how large the company is and what size you're dealing with. Typically larger companies have healthier financials and positive revenue hence blue chip stocks. The more you look at this the better idea you'll have of what good financials look like.

**Data** - This is where you get into the ins and outs of the stocks performance. This ties in with chart analysis and technicals which I will briefly touch on. Here you are looking at the numbers, net income, sales, cash flow, public float, dividend, and short interest. My go to is checking the short interest % because it gives you an idea of the number of short sellers vs long term shareholders. Less shorters usually = more sustainable profits long term. Different websites also have analysts that give a consensus rating for the current stock's value, these can be nice as long as you don't only look at one. Along with that they also give out 1 year target price estimates. Gather the data together and take notes.

**News** - News is a big factor in DD and often has a big influence on the stocks value. Depending on the intensity and how big the news is, it can create selloffs, surges, etc. It's important to note that news is certainly not everything as a lot of the time it will present underwhelming or even irrelevant depending on what the intraday market trend is. This provides good opportunities for entry points if the news is slightly bad but not long term because the dip will only be temporary. News can be so many different things ranging from employee layoffs, financials, products, etc. Gather it together and assess how you think it will influence value. You have to be on top of news and have sources to be up to date because the market reacts almost instantly. (Refer to source section at bottom)

**History &amp; Technicals** - Next up we have the technicals, i'm merging this with history because this is what I do. Here you mainly want to look at 5 year charts and then get into the 1 year to stay current. Search for healthy trend lines and sustainability for the long term. When looking at these you're seeing the stock's history and how it performed under past market trends. I like to see how they did during the 2008 recession and note how fast they recovered. This can be a good reference for current and future market dips (pandemics).Find bearish or bullish indicating patterns to represent the current future of the value. The shorter you plan on holding, the more technicals are required.

**Sector**- Last but not least is sector position. The company's industry can be performing really well or really poor depending on the economic situation. For example tech companies have been showing stronger trends during the pandemic rather than retailers for numerous reasons. Similar to the oil crisis situation that brings all the oil stocks down. This is a starting point when investing in a company and determining how you think their sector will do in the future. Many traders stay specific to industries they know well, as myself i'm big on the entertainment/psychedelics area.

*Sources*

There are many websites that report news and data but here are my favorites.

Market Watch is my favorite and I use them to find stock data most of the time

Investopedia - great for news

Market Beat - data, analysts, etc

Yahoo Finance - news, good source for everything

Finviz - technicals, screeners

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since that's the basics and general overview, here's a compilation of various processes and tips that will hopefully offer a little more specificity and assistance. 

**Free sources I can check:**

- Wikipedia: Read the story behind their company
- Company site: What they do
- Seeking Alpha: Latest analysis
- Sec Site: Read 10Q and 10K (Unaudited financials and company filings)

**What I need to be capable of understanding:**

- The company's plan for growth
- Your own level of confidence in your research
- The challenges and economic cycles of this industry 

Be able to summarize/condense the business or industry in a short paragraph or a couple of sentences. 

**Moat** 

- What is the Moat?

- How hard is it to compete with this company?

- Compare this company to its competition.

- What are the Big Four Growth Rates (Net Income, Book Value, Sales, Operating Cash)? Are they speeding up or slowing down?

- Does the company have enough cash to last several year if it looses money?

- How were sales and earnings during the last recession?

**Management**

- Does the CEO have integrity?
- Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well but clam up or disclaim responsibility when trouble occurs?
- How happy are its employees?
- Does the company have any debt? If yes, could it be paid with one or two years of free cash flow?
- Has the company indicated that it plans to take on debt any time in the future?
- Is the management team buying or selling its company's stock? (Inside investors)
- How are the Return on Equity and Return on Invested Capital Numbers of the year?

I don't research any stocks, just go buy a widely held index fund.   See r/bogleheads or [https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Getting\_started](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Getting_started) lots of deep insight into why this on average, will beat most active funds.   In other words:  I researched a long-term investment strategy that is proven to work instead of doing the work of trying to pick individual stocks.   

One data point about the statement above.   The most recent [SP Global report](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/spiva/#/reports) for 2020 showed that just over 75% of funds underperformed the S&P 500 index.  This means that the majority of the most highly paid and valuable fund managers don't succeed in beating the market.  So I don't see why I should feel like I can beat the performance of people who do this for a living.

Now, note I said 90%,  There is 10% of my portfolio I invest in things which I believe in long-term or that makes me happy to own a piece of or that reflects a trend I'm seeing and I want to invest a tiny bit in.   

Some examples:

I bought a couple of shares of  TSLA like 2-3 years ago when it was 1/10th of the price it is now (pre-split, so I now have 10 shares).   I bought it because I don't think anyone should bet against Elon Musk, and I think that TSLA will survive long into the future.  

I have a bit of DAL (Delta Airlines) during the covid dip because I am a big fan of the way they treat their customers as opposed to the other 2 big US airlines, and I couldn't pass up getting some of their stock on sale.

I have a couple of shares each of a few thematic ETFs that I find intriguing such as IPO, BUZZ, and SFYF.   Or ones that make my inner geek happy such as ROKT.    And I have (or more accurately trying to reduce my position to) 1 share each of the ARK funds.

I also have a few individual shares of companies that haven't fully recovered from COVID yet, but I would expect to like cruise companies and the like.

Note that all of the holdings in this 10% of my portfolio I consider to be a 'gambling' portfolio.   If any of them go to zero, I'm not going to care.

In general I stick only with sectors and industries that I am familiar with.  That way, I know pretty quickly what to look for in terms what their product or service is, and if its of any quality.

Then I'll look at their ""fundamentals.""  Their revenue, assets, profit, and debt.  I like to see a history of these numbers for the past 5 years, if the company has been around at least that long.  There are more fundamentals, but those are the four I look for.  As you read more and more of these about more and more companies, you'll learn more and more about which details there matter.

Try to find moves the company has made to get better position.  Sourcing deals, partnerships, spinoffs, mergers, anything.  Seeing jumps or drops in stock price history can hint about what time frame in which those events occurred.

Then I take a gander at the competition.

After that, I look at leadership.  You need to know about the people calling the shots, because they determine whether the company is successful, stagnant, or failing.  They determine the vision, direction, and path to their goals.  A company with a great product, lots of profit, tons of assets, and little debt doesn't mean shit to me if their *new* CEO is SuckBob FuckPants.  Bad leaders can tank good companies.

Conversely, good leadership can save failing companies. 

So find out who's calling the shots, who the CEO is, CTO or whatever, head of research, anyone.  Their career history, the track records of previous companies they've worked for (did they save something or tank it, or just meh?), where they went to school, etc.  It doesn't have to be FBI-class dossiers, but you should be able to name names and say ""They did such and such at X company before, and now they're at Y and building/doing an even better version!""

Fight your own confirmation bias.  Look for potential obstacles for that company, and give them real consideration.  This is why I stick to things that I know - I'll already be familiar with industry trends and common obstacles.  By doing this, I can skip writing many pages about obstacles.

The reason to do any DD is to inform yourself, but it helps me to pretend like I'm writing for a group of serious investors.  Once you've read, summarized, sorted and collated all of the relevant info and have a nice 5-pager, you can take a day off, then read the whole thing over again with a clear head.

And have fun.  I'm weird, but DD is hella fun for me.  I have no idea why.",runningAndJumping22,1,/r/stocks/comments/m3vr11/how_do_you_do_your_due_diligence/gqtrcuv/,0.082,0.762,0.157,0.9908

428,FCF," 1) **Relative Valuation to Peers** and how that ticker stacks up to a specific comp set. Are they trading conspicuously below their peers? Is there a reason *why* the market is pricing them at a discount? If not, probably undervalued.

Trading multiples from most important to least as follows:

* EV / '21E EBITDA

* EV / '22E EBITDA

* P / '21E CFPS

* P / '22E CFPS

* P / '21E FCFPS

* P / '22E FCFPS

2) **Leverage profile** also compared to peers. Relevant multiples / metrics below:

* Net Debt / LTM EBITDA

* Current Liquidity (cash + revolver availability)

Filings solvency / balance sheet dilligence: 
 
* Do they have any impending debt maturity towers in '21 and '22? 
* Do they have enough liquidity + FCF to cover any looming payments? 
* What sort of guidance has management issued during their Q4 earnings call about next years capital budget? Did any analysts push on management during Q&A over liquidity (or any other particular topic)?

If not, kind of sounds like they are in deep shit, particularly if they have solid fundamentals but seems to be trading at a lower multiple compared to peers.

 * Do they have preferred shares hidden on their BS. Are they a value play that trades largely on yield - ergo, dividend payments aren't going to be easy to cut to enhance any liquidity shortfalls.

432,CFFI," ^ This. I’ve just recent started my portfolio a month or so back and have been green following a strategy like this. Even through the recent Nasdaq sell off.

Have a diversified portfolio of value/growth stocks. My growth stocks are companies I really like (maybe products I use every day or I think have value for the long term). The value portion are stocks with strong fundamentals growth, positive EPS, low p/e, low Long-term debt to capital, and potentially trading below book value.

I choose my value stocks by first running a scan on think or swim with the following conditions:

1) Stock Price > $5
2) 10k Volume or more
3) P/E between 0-15

From there, I add fundamentals columns like book value, p/e, current EPS, EPS 5-yr avg, current Revenue, Revenue 5-yr avg, current LT Debt to capital, and LT Debt to capital 5 years ago. 

I take this data, copy and paste it to a spreadsheet, then run some if statements to see if the stock is trading below book value, has current Revenue growth higher than 5-yr avg, EPS growth, and reduction in debt. If all these conditions are met, I then do research into the company to see what they do and recent news. Also maybe check out their website as well.

Following these rules, I’ve found some hidden gems and have made double digit % returns in 2-3 weeks time. Stocks like NXST, CFFI, VWAGY, PDM, BRK/B, and SPTN have done really well for me even when the recent market sell off was happening.",ipeench_,20,/r/stocks/comments/m3vr11/how_do_you_do_your_due_diligence/gqroizm/,0.051,0.785,0.164,0.9812

583,HD, We are probably going to be in a bull market far more often than not in the future. And as more individuals enter active investing due to the explosion of social media and investing apps I think the market is going to continue to trend toward growth stocks. No one is buying shares of HD in Webull or Robinhood.,Puzzleheaded_Bar5055,1,/r/stocks/comments/m3zc25/which_stock_will_buy_with_your_1400/gqthll3/,0.035,0.842,0.123,0.6771
584,BYND," I looked into them, 1B value with one actual plant, there is no true barrier to there product as it is just, we source good plants, and are chef has tattoos. There sales info was also kind of scary. Something like 4 units sold per week per walmart location. 

They could turn out to be something or they could turn out to just be another of a long long list of pre made froze food companies. Don't think it is right to compare to BYND who has a actual barrier to there market as no one else has been able to produce a meat sub as close to meat as they have. Now BYND could also get completely blown up if we see a major leap in lap grown meat.",Adamwlu,3,/r/stocks/comments/m3zc25/which_stock_will_buy_with_your_1400/gqsxayq/,0.08,0.843,0.078,0.1796

787,SE," They'll face stiff competition in SE Asia from Sea Ltd. That region has a rather different culture from that of SK, a country which isn't much liked over there except as a source of tourism and investing. Most people in the region will go with Sea because it's based in Singapore and viewed as a native company of the region, who understands its culture and concerns. Singapore mixes the three major ethnic and cultural components of the area so it is excellently placed to support the kind of multicultural company that can be successful in SE Asia.

They might do better in Japan but keep in mind that most people there prefer Japanese companies (economic nationalism) and SK has a complex relationship with Japan, which has been on the lower side in recent times.

I don't see much potential for them to copy Amazon's success in cloud services (which is the driver of Amazon's profits), largely because SK has been lagging in software services forever. It doesn't have the same kind of tech ecosystem that exists in the US or even in China. SK is stronger in hardware than software. Even Samsung never produced any software of value (for example, their cell-phones use Android with some bloatware added in).

They could expand more easily into China but they are unlikely to capture any serious market share there because they'll face huge competition from Alibaba and the like.",Ahrideva,9,/r/stocks/comments/m41m7y/anyone_buy_into_coupang/gqsznwz/,0.033,0.833,0.134,0.9775

796,GE," GE is an American company who focuses on power generation, air travel (engines), and medical machinery. Two of the three are key aspects of Biden’s Build Back Better plan. The last will/has been positively impacted due to the coronavirus pandemic and our increasing use of the medical industry. (Medicare for all is coming, who is supplying the machinery to meet that demand?)

They are the largest producer of wind turbines in America. As we phase into renewable power, wind energy is at the top of the list. (Halide-X)

Nuclear Power is the final destination of renewable energy. Who do you think is going to produce the machinery, if not General ELECTRIC. 

Long term and short term, GE as a company has upsides. See above. 

Technically, GE is at their pre-covid price after consolidating around 10-11.50 for a few months, and broke out into the uptrend the past month. GE just announced an 8-1 reverse split, which may have caused the 15% drop in price over the last few trading days, which was quickly bought up at close of Thursday and all of Friday. I think this was really profit taking from their run from 7. Short term they’re still in an uptrend. 

Through the previous year, GE hit some serious support on their long term downtrend (previous few years) and are now positioned to head to the top of the channel they’re trading in and test that. Think 20-25 before they are met with serious resistance.

I hold Jan 2022 and Jan 2023 Calls at varying strikes, mostly $20 for both. June 21 $15. Sept 21 $15. 

Don’t listen to this noise on the management. They are getting paid big bucks to get their name dragged through the mud. Culp is bringing GE to the present.

&#x200B;

I actually like the reverse split - people must remember that GE was one of the most widely held stock and a dividend darling for years for the ""boomer"" generation. With their divestures over the last three years coupled with restructuring the number of outstanding were grossly exaggerated.

Most reverse splits are done to maintain NYSE / NASDAQ listing requirements - this is not the case with GE.

The new CEO has a tremendous track records and hold people accountable - not like Immelt and Flannery were idiots - I actually sold all my share after hearing Immelt give a talk - I did not trust him.

I brought back at $6 range and like the aviation and healthcare. They also got power stream-lined and the renewable platform will pay dividends for years.

Why? Dilution. They've sold shares. So it isn't going back to $40, at least in the short/medium term, or they start buying back those shares.

But they won't be able to do that for a while because they have so much debt.

I had CCL some months ago, small position. But I sold it and took a small gain once I realized it isn't a good long term bet to get to their precovid price.

877,MGM," Bought MGM shares when it went down to $8. I also bought a $42 call as well. Like all travel/resorts, MGM might go up as vaccinations continue and more people will travel. Last year, MGM slowly grew back to $28-$29 where it was before the crash. MGM is more focused with “BetMGM"" sports betting to compete with Draftkings and Fanduel. With the new Buffalo partnership, I think it will help MGM go up a bit. They are also planning on adding a Buffalo’s Wild Wings inside MGM Grand.

MGM is a good stock to own for mid-long term. They got the huge jump from $28-$38 due to the newly renovated rooms at the Bellagio. They also completed updating half of their properties with the “Stay Well” rooms options similar to MGM Grand “Stay Well” rooms.

But ... they help you out a bit. They make your cost basis higher now at $19.44, not $16.40. So if you sell it at $18, for example, you will on paper realize loss. Not gain. But that’s only on paper for tax reasons. In reality you will still be holding you 18*1100. So nothing changes for you in terms of how much you actually lost.

It could be that the buyer did an early assignment near close to gamble that the price would jump ITM after hours? Or it could be there is a dividend incoming? Either way, Options technically have up to a time to exercise/assigned after hours.

A good rule of thumb I use is once you get to 5-10% down from those levels, start to build a position. I personally don’t think it will get cheaper because of the shortage, if anything that is a positive for them because increased demand = higher prices which means more money (we are already seeing chip companies raising prices such as NVDA), but the dope part is the $30 something billion that is going towards addressing the shortage, so when those supply chains open up you now have enough supply to meet huge demand with higher prices, which equals big bucks.

931,HUGE," Nope, it is a great way to stay broke!

Companies try to target minimum stock prices to stay on certain stock exchanges. They often create enough shares to start out the price the $10-$20 range. This makes it easy for people to buy into with whole shares and leaves room for the price to grow.

Companies don't start off below $5.

So when you see a penny stock, you see something that has struggled. It is on death watch, bankruptcy watch, or something is highly speculative about it.

Many of them die off.

What penny stocks do, however, is it generates alot of volatility and some people try to time short trades to make a profit off of the volatility. The problem is you're risking it could go down and not make it back up or go bankrupt. You don't want to be stuck with the hot potatoe.

There are also a few rare companies that fell off the radar, were on death watch, but had a speculative innovation and it roars back with HUGE gains. The problem is to find them you might have to pick a few hundred that go bankrupt or go nowhere.

Other risks are penny stocks aren't traded in the normal stock exchanges. There are less reporting requirements for many of them and there are some investors who are trying to use tiny speculative companies to scam investors. This makes it really hard to do a full due diligence on the company, unless you have a direct contact or in the industry with the business.

In short, do not start here! Even when you play here, only do it with a very small percentage of your portfolio you're ok with risking. They are high risk things and many of them will die off, but a rare few are striking gold. This is not where you want to risk your retirement plan or any money you need for an emergency.

&#x200B;

Start with an S&P 500 index ETF, like SPY. As you learn more branch out to more unique things.

The index ETF owns a piece of all of the 500 largest companies across many industries. It will be less risky and go up and down with the overall market. This will be the less risky place to be, while you learn more and feel comfortable your not going to make mistakes.",cwdawg15,3,/r/stocks/comments/m4260k/are_penny_stocks_recommended_for_broke_beginners/gqtmsc4/,0.137,0.768,0.095,-0.952

This sub doesn't really like penny stocks but if you find a company you like and their financials check-out, why not?

I'm invested (can't name it here) in a penny stock that is the biggest retailer on their segment, has the best RoA (Return on Assets) of the industry and somehow is really undervalued compared to the other more know companies. 

I've had it go up 15%, down 30% and up 25% in the last month. I don't mind because I trully believe there are a lot of upcoming good news ahead and long term it just makes sense.

This sub somehow considers all risky investiments bad investiments but I only bought 3 stocks in my life, Tesla at 74$ (post split price), GM stop at 37$ and last month I also invested in a penny stock.

951,IMO," I shop at Macy’s online for a lot of my clothes. We live in the countryside so there isn’t much decent shopping to choose from.  I won’t buy clothes from WalMart and Kohl’s is often disappointing.  Macy’s online selection is much better than what they have in store.  I bought Macy’s stock last spring during quarantine and sold it when it raised a bunch.   I wouldn’t buy the stock now, too high.  

Like many brick and mortar retailers the future is unknown. However, I’ve been happy with their selection online and have had good experiences with their overall service.  

IMO, shopping on Amazon for clothes feels like I’m at a flea market.  When you see something cute, it’s hard to know if the item will be decent or just some crap made in China. I’d rather shop online with a retailer I trust, and Amazon is too much of the Wild West with all kinds of sellers that have come out of the woodwork to make a buck.",Princessferfs,2,/r/stocks/comments/m3zqkh/any_thoughts_on_macys/gqtx9vh/,0.041,0.823,0.136,0.9432

In terms of AAPL, there was a period between about 2008 - 2013 (I don't remember the exact years) where AAPL was engaged in share repurchases making longer term options contracts possibly superior to stock.

However, AAPL is paying a dividend now.  So, you would be missing out on that with the contracts.

Also, you need to look at IRS 1040-ES to determine if you need to make an estimated quarterly payment. In some cases, if you owe more than $1000 at tax time, you will have to pay penalties. 

If you are unsure about anything, seek professional tax advice.",freeskier93,4,/r/stocks/comments/m4ad7p/tax_advice_capital_gains/gqtee3f/,0.096,0.852,0.052,-0.4019

1000,CAN," You don’t get a subtraction of what you owe. You get a subtraction of what your total income is. 

So, (assuming 20% bracket for easy math):
If you make $100 you owe $20

If you make $100 and lose $20 you will then owe $16 NOT $0. (20% of your $80 total gains)

If you make $100 and owe $20 and throw and extra $20 at a risky stock and lose it, you’ve spent $20 to save $4


Now what you CAN do is figure out your tax bracket and only sell off enough to keep you from going into a higher tax bracket. This should save you money (assuming you don’t lose value on the stock in the mean time, or that your opportunity cost of not diversifying isn’t higher than paying a higher tax bracket.)
Depending on how much the stock is worth this may take a very long time to do. Or, if might just take one or two years. 

Also if you don’t have a Roth IRA get, get one. Like yesterday. And max it out each year. You may not want to take high risk trades in that account though. 

Or also you can open other Retirement type accounts that won’t owe any capital gains until you cash them out in retirement. This has the downside of not being able to spend the money in the mean time, but you don’t pay taxes on every trade. (You pay taxes when you withdraw at retirement. Also your contributions (not gains) are tax deductible in many account types, which can help you stay in a lower tax bracket )

Otherwise just pay the gains and move on - it means you made money which is a good thing. The only reason you may need to be sure not to take any gains is if, for example it will negate any benefits you receive (for example, let’s say you receive Medicaid. If you make $1000 in selling stock that is not enough to pay for even two mo this of health insurance if you get kicked off Medicaid, but could be enough to affect your income (temporarily) but kick you off Medicaid for the year. It would be a net loss on selling the stock. (Of course if your gains are $125k then losing Medicaid wouldn’t be an issue since you can afford health insurance from your gains.)

Facebook went ape shit with allegations following this and eventually everyone put their 2 cents in on this restaurants yelp. Over 80 1 star reviews later they didn't look so sharp. Only 2 days later they paid for all their reviews to be taken down as if nothing ever happened.

1008,DD," To finish my thought, I keep a lot of my risk money in leveraged funds like TQQQ, SOXL, FNGU.  TQQQ is my fave since it automatically keeps you in the top 100 NASDAQ stocks.  All of the them are very risky but if you're young and/or have the $ for a high risk trade, it's ok imho to buy some and hold for a few years. 

Don't trade options.   They are very difficult and will behave differently than you expect.   There's no easy option trade,  don't believe anyone who says there is, especially if they say things like ""you can just roll it away"".  Trust me.  Give yourself a few years trading stocks first, then watch all of option alpha videos.

1011,TLRY," What do you mean nothing before the merger is announced? The merger was announced months ago. Why are they doing it now? Because there is news about the merger so this should drum up some business while it is in the spotlight?

You actually have no evidence of anything they are accusing TLRY of. You have no leads or findings. Nothing has been announced other than the lawsuits. You are arguing from a baseless stance. If there really was criminal activity and they wanted to win, they would involve the SEC to give their suite merit. If the SEC finds wrong doing, the lawsuits would be a slam dunk. The fact that the SEC announced nothing shows they are just trying to get suckers, like yourself, to buy into it. They didn't even say they were working with the SEC. I assume you are one of the suckers because you are defending the baseless claims so hard.

Also, comparing a corrupt cop with no evidence making a claim in this situation would make the lawyers the corrupt cop. A fact less claim with no evidence that they don't want the SEC to investigate.

1016,GME," So stock is in an investment in a company and the way to think about getting discounts are the following 1) pre-ipo funding 2) large correction but fundamentals remain intact 3) buy in before a momentum play comes into public view, I.e GME at less than $10. 

No business would want or desire to drive what you are suggesting because then pricing wouldn’t be based on different parties trying to find intrinsic valuation. Price doesn’t mean anything in stocks, market cap is relative but is an indication of its current valuation. 

Discounts, etc is meant to drive more demand which drives more revenue so you want to see potentially an organization due that for their respective services or products if they aren’t getting expected traction.
