3,CXW," Well it appears to me that he‚Äôs taken his own warning very seriously (just like when he shorted the housing market) regarding inflation. The thing with CXW is that they own tons of properties which the government uses. Prisons yes, but even more Social Security Administration buildings, Homeland Security buildings etc etc... It seems to me he‚Äôs started shifting all his money into things that will be less affected by any inflation that might come about. People will always need property, telecom infrastructure (LUMN), materials for manufacturing (DNOW), and of course, beer üç∫ (TAP).

28,CBD," Only invest in businesses that have an easy business model to understand, you may even use the product. I‚Äôm mostly in blue chip/dividend type stuff, with some growth and REITs as well. But they are all companies with easy to understand business models. The 1 penny stock I hold is 100 shares of Bevcanna (BVNNF)(on TD Ameritrade). But, they have an easy to understand business model. They are in the cannabis/beverage/health and wellness industry. They produce beverages with cannabis in them(Canadian company), they are also a white label company, meaning they make the product, and other brands pay them a fee to put their logos on the product. Seems like a good way to get into the Cannabis sector. Because you have people that would buy it for the cannabis, beer drinkers who didn‚Äôt want to smoke cannabis might buy these products now, plus Heath and wellness customers would buy as well because they understand the benefits of cannabis/CBD. I bought 100 shares for 75 bucks, the stock has gone down in the week I‚Äôve held it, but it‚Äôs very long term for me, and they trade for under a dollar a share. I can afford to lose 75 bucks. But in a year or 5, who knows what they will be worth. 
That‚Äôs my advice, might be more solid then many of those penny stocks. But, again, not financial advice.
