If I go talk to my neighbor this morning about AMC (or any stock) and the potential I think it has to make me a crap ton of money no one is going to care.

45,CASH," Blame Fed about the house. Fed lowers interest rate that people take advantage of it to buy houses. It makes more inflation. Fed controls everything to benefit corps. 

Plus supply is shorted during this time. Everything is almost doubled up 

It may crash. But I believe it is going down steadily when mortgage begins. Closure after closure. Market is just temporarily good due to the crowd, more hirings, spending, and opening… 

Nope, it is just temporary bc they barely have full-time contracts. Restaurants are smart dicks bc they just wanna hire 19-29 hrs to work with bonus. People accept it and it turns out temporary. 

Covid is not over. Demand is stagnant. Airlines will collapse without govt aid. They cannot profit domestic traveljng only. 

Keep ur cash in hand bc “ CASH IS A KING”. 
You are not gonna profit the house. Closure will happen everywhere this September. More sale and sale in discount except some hot area such as Florida or Texas.

129,UPS," I don't know, there seem to be a lot of things going on in shipping that may not necessarily be great for the industry as a whole.  $YELL getting hammered for declaring themselves essential (which I'm not sure how they couldn't be with all the shipping they did for the DOD). and using loan money to buy new trucks.  FedEx Freight dumping their LTL services to smaller customers.  It seems like Amazon is moving towards creating more distribution centers and handling their own ""to home"" deliveries rather than paying UPS, USPS, or FEDEX to deliver.  

I have been looking into investing in the trucking industry since April and after analyzing FedEx Freight, $YELL, and $XPO, I ultimately felt like $YELL had the most room to grow in their respective industry.  $XPO ended up being the winner.  Their chart looked great back then and  still looks great today.  $KNX recently made an acquisition of AAA Cooper and their LTL sector is expected to grow.  The problem is with companies like Amazon taking on their own shipping and FedEx exiting the LTL service, LTL isn't looking all that profitable right now.   

Companies like $XPO, $YELL, $KNX who depended on solid shipping needs of companies taking on their own shipping may need to take on jobs that Owner/Operators used to depend on and they can more than likely offer a better price because they already have the equipment and employees to get those jobs done efficiently.

Add in oil prices doubling since Nov., increasing interest in states wanting to fix roads with a new gas tax, requirements to be carbon neutral in the near future, this industry is facing some setbacks.  I can't necessarily correlate those setbacks to a market crash.  Now a market correction is just going to happen at some point, you can blame that and correlate that with whatever you want.",AngryBagOfDeath,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ol4kc7/trucking_industry_may_be_indicating_a_market/h5ce59u/,0.065,0.826,0.109,0.8923
130,FL," I work in logistics and I don't think that the trucking industry is dying off any time soon. Rates have never been higher than they have been the last 4 months. Driver pay has increased by 80-100% for Over the Road in the last 4 years. Drivers are easily clearing 6 figures. There's a massive driver shortage since the Pandemic hit. There's also a massive labor shortage to where receivers cannot get any trailers unloaded due to not being able to hire any dock workers. 2 years ago a trucking company would get paid $4500-5200 to haul a dry load from SoCal to the northeast. Now they're getting paid $8000+ to do the same load. Brokerages are just printing money right now. There's countless examples of the big asset carriers posting their best quarters in history.

That FL to NJ load you said your friend is getting paid ""only"" $2800 for. That load would have went for $2000 2 years ago. Outbound FL is known as being dirt cheap, often paying less than $1 a mile. I do think that eventually it's going to correct, but quarter 4 and peak season is approaching, and capacity could continue to get tighter.

A good metric to understand how hot the freight market is currently is the Outbound Tender Reject Index. 2 years ago they would tell you have if the index was above 8%, it signifies a hot market. The index has been above 20% this whole year. Some markets have over 30% tender reject. This index means that the market is so hot that trucking companies are rejecting their committed freight due to being able to make so much more money on adhoc/spot freight. 

From everything I've seen, logistics is having its best year ever, even better than 2018. A crash could happen after Q1 of next year but I think the only people affected would be the small mom and pop companies as well as people too overleveraged on the spot market. The fear of automatic trucks scares young people away from joining the industry, so there will likely be a driver shortage for a long time to come. Trucking companies will print money from their customers while they jack the prices of consumer goods to offset their transportation budgets getting absolutely blown away.",pokeypummel17,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ol4kc7/trucking_industry_may_be_indicating_a_market/h5clkpq/,0.081,0.849,0.071,-0.431
131,XPO," This blows me away.  I work as a freight coordinator, and every day is literally me throwing pickup requests out there and praying the driver shows up.  I just got into it with dispatch at XPO yesterday and I called their driver a lying little bitchnugget because he said our loads weren't even ready, but I saw the fucker look at the line of trucks waiting to get into loading and reverse out of there.

Prices are literally insane.  Its getting to the point where customers are canceling items because shipping is more than the item's MSRP.  Wayfair is one of our accounts, and they removed one of our products from their line for this reason.  I now have an entire corner of the warehouse filled with concrete end tables i literally cannot sell.  Roadrunner quoted me $546 to take a 42x42x28 palletizing item from Cerritos to Malibu, a drive I could make myself in maybe an hour?  Add to the fact that we add 30% to freight costs now, and it's just ludicrous.

I need a crash.  I want a break.  Our company has grown 600% IN A YEAR and corporate is still on my ass to get more product out the door. Warehouse is tired.

10 year dispatch here .

Market still pays super good money except it slow downed a bit. 

Always after july 4 weekend market slows down till seb end - october when xmas shit starts booming .

But i would agree that trucking is connected - because trucking market never saw prices and money like this like it was last 2 years and even during pandemic .


I personally think its part of inflation and that’s why it will BOOM.

379,DD," My comments were sarcasm, I can say I am a bag holder, but I am still ahead of the game I jumped in early. I have sold for profit and picked up on the dead cat bounce. I have a few shares that I have bought on a high and I am sitting on them. But in the overall positions I am very well set. I swing trade mostly but have long term stuff. Most of my hiding are the stock itself. I do options when I see and then research my own DD. 
Not gonna lie, I pay attention to the pump n dump crowd, and if that makes me a bad person...well I am a bad person, nor sure if a lot of the folks understand me and most who make money here. I am here for me, my $$ and take advantage of every opportunity to make a $. In my opinion if you are a smart person that like to play in this market.
1. Have a long term growth account that is diverse.

Things I know for certain
1. A new hit Video game always comes out every year, and theres always gonna be a need for gaming equipment. (3/5 essentials for my PC are CRSR, Mouse, keyboard, mousepad.) 

2. Streamers get old. It doesnt matter who you are, how funny you are, how good your gameplay is. You will never satisfy every viewer, which means streamers die off. Forcing new ones to replace them and purchase new equipment. 

3. Kids love video games. Hand them an ipad, give them an xbox, let them play on your desktop. It doesnt matter what system they play on, they love video games. 

4. Equipment breaks. No matter what piece of hardware you get, its going to break eventually. I replace my mouse / keyboard every 2 years or as I see fit.

Tech: UPST is a tech company at its core, operating within and disrupting the finance industry. Their product is cutting-edge AI underwriting that evaluates risk better than financial institutions (and other fintechs) are able to. Their credit models can be applied to many different verticals (see TAM)

TAM: Already huge with personal lending and they’ve just begun expanding into auto lending, including an acquisition of Prodigy (online platform which partners with dealerships nationwide to offer auto financing). UPST is also ripe for expansion into credit cards, student loans, mortgages, retail loans, etc. given that their credit models are their bread & butter.

Leadership: well-known ex-Google execs + Thiel Fellow. Investors include former Google CEO Eric Schmidt as well as Mark Cuban & Marc Benioff. They’ve built a team of top-tier Silicon Valley data scientists & engineers.

Financials & Execution: Both reported earnings since recent IPO have significantly beat expectations, with actual profitability, strong revenue growth, loan count growth, and conversion rate improvements. Next earnings will be reported on 8/10. This has all been accomplished with a modest number of bank partners and they’ve closed acquisitions and partnerships since IPO (Prodigy, NXTsoft) which will help accelerate this growth in the coming quarters.

Holdings: CEO still owns ~15% of the stock and a huge number of shares are still held by insiders, despite the lock-up expiring about a month ago. Signals confidence in company and conviction that stock is undervalued.

Price: Up ~450% since IPO, and hit an all-time high of $190 a few months ago, but down over the last several weeks and at current price of $110, sounds like a bargain!",Orangeblueglue,7,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/olkm2v/bought_a_first_class_seat_on_the_upst/h5ey5e1/,0.005,0.862,0.133,0.975
513,UPST," Long time lurker and really believe in this one. YOLO’d in at $110.

Tech: UPST is a tech company at its core, operating within and disrupting the finance industry. Their product is cutting-edge AI underwriting that evaluates risk better than financial institutions (and other fintechs) are able to. Their credit models can be applied to many different verticals (see TAM)

TAM: Already huge with personal lending and they’ve just begun expanding into auto lending, including an acquisition of Prodigy (online platform which partners with dealerships nationwide to offer auto financing). UPST is also ripe for expansion into credit cards, student loans, mortgages, retail loans, etc. given that their credit models are their bread & butter.

Leadership: well-known ex-Google execs + Thiel Fellow. Investors include former Google CEO Eric Schmidt as well as Mark Cuban & Marc Benioff. They’ve built a team of top-tier Silicon Valley data scientists & engineers.

Financials & Execution: Both reported earnings since recent IPO have significantly beat expectations, with actual profitability, strong revenue growth, loan count growth, and conversion rate improvements. Next earnings will be reported on 8/10. This has all been accomplished with a modest number of bank partners and they’ve closed acquisitions and partnerships since IPO (Prodigy, NXTsoft) which will help accelerate this growth in the coming quarters.

If it dips any further the value will be simply irresistible given their growth. In fact it’s sitting so hard on support that it dipped much less than the general semiconductor sector yesterday. I’m kind of hoping it dips some more as it’s effected by ETF exposure. I like the value.

603,AM," SpotGamma Daily Note for: 07/16/2021 AM

*""Futures touched a low of 4340 overnight before pushing higher – current 4360. This indicates an opening near 4375 which is our largest gamma strike. As a reminder the bulk of SPX options expire on the open, with equities and some smaller SPX expiring at 4pm EST. We see 30% of gamma rolling off for SPX, SPY and QQQ today making this a fairly large expiration. Furthermore 48% of single stocks have their most concentrated gamma position expiring at 4:15.""*

*""We do not anticipate a lot of volatility for today, but anticipate a pickup in movement next week.  We’ve certainly been pinned to the 4350-4400 range for the last week. With that for next week we are looking for markets to break either 4400 or 4300, with 4500 setting up as a major upside target for the August expiration cycle. To the downside it looks like the 4350 area will be the gamma flip point with 4300 being the major “risk off” level due to negative gamma.""*

*""Around July 1st markets put in a low in realized volatility, and we think that will be the low for the year. Plotted below are the implied volatility levels for all 25 delta options, with each color representing a different number of days to expiration.  You can see that July 1 was also a low for implied volatility in the S&P.   With that, implied volatility has increased suggesting markets are primed for a bit more movement.""*

Chart Here:  https://imgur.com/gallery/FEwEHxj

*""Higher implied volatility lines up ahead of the post-OPEX volatility window opening which suggests that if markets wanted to sell the options mechanics are lining up to “expand” that selling. Seeing both sides, this could also simply be another opportunity for traders to sell volatility at slightly higher levels, and slide this market up to new highs.""*

*""You’re probably thinking “great, he said markets could go up or down” and the answer is “yes”. However we’ve been calling for essentially no movement in markets over the past week and that has been the case. Now we see an upside window to break through 4400, but also the opportunity to spark a rather nasty selloff.""*

*""Its that selloff that has us concerned. Markets reflexively sell volatility every time its offered and that trade has worked out quite well for the past year (ie buy the little dips!). There will be a point in which the forces that initially sell will overrun those early volatility sellers and we think that leads to a very nasty unwind (as we mentioned before, think Sep ’20).""*

*""There is a large amount of open interest down at the 4000 strike, and we can’t help to flag that as a major downside support level that could be visited rather quickly. Keep in mind this is not a fundamental/macro call, just a view on the mechanics of positioning.""*

*""As always, rather than guessing we simply watch the Volatility Trigger level. Bulls hold the reigns above that, but if that line is broken then we think you must respect the change for a nasty left tail move.""*

649,USA," You missed the best thing about $PAYO. It now provides upfront capital to online sellers based on their previous recurring sales revenue.  So small business on Amazon or Wish can grow faster. No need for a bank. When their business grows, so does Payoneer.  

This is basically what the startup “Pipe” does for startups but Payoneer is doing it for online retailers selling through big marketplaces.  Chamath and Jason Calacanis talk about Pipe all the time on the All-In podcast. 

 Payoneer isn’t just money from  payments, it is really a becoming a growth platform for every online seller outside the USA. This is how it will be more valuable than PayPal.  

In the near future anyone wants to sell through global online marketplace outside the USA will sign up to Payoneer.  Now think of Starlink and how access to broadband will grow in Africa, Asia and developing countries in the next few years. All the growth in internet users is in a Africa and they will use Payoneer to sell through the existing marketplaces partnered with Payoneer.  All the broadband growth is outside the USA, all those small business will sign up to payoneer to sell their goods.",jdjdjjdjjd,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ol6v3j/payo_your_baby_momma_so_she_can_feed_the_kids/h5e9vod/,0.015,0.881,0.104,0.962

I lDGAF but if I’m betting on how a stock’s price will move in the future, I just think MAYBE I’ll take a look at how it’s moving right now.

So you have a reason to be there from the chart. And a way to measure when you’re ‘wrong’ enough that you need to bail. That’s it. How you manage the trade and your emotions from there is still entirely up to you and is where most of us really fuck up - not having a plan or not sticking with it, averaging down losers, etc. TA ain’t helping that.

707,BV," Not op, but I'm holding about 1k shares of NRZ as well as $12 Jan 23 calls.

&#x200B;

Prior to the Caliber acquisition, BV was around 11.40 or so, +/- 5%. Currently that amount has probably dropped some due to Caliber not being active yet, and some dilution to pay for the purchase of the company.

Also - prior to the pandemic, book values I believe was in the 14-15 range and the stock was trading upwards of 17-18.  During the pandemic, they were forced to sell some of their assets at a loss in order to de-risk the company.

&#x200B;

Prior to the Caliber acquisition, BV was around 11.40 or so, +/- 5%. Currently that amount has probably dropped some due to Caliber not being active yet, and some dilution to pay for the purchase of the company.

Also - prior to the pandemic, book values I believe was in the 14-15 range and the stock was trading upwards of 17-18.  During the pandemic, they were forced to sell some of their assets at a loss in order to de-risk the company.

711,ICE," As a car enthusiast and someone who’s thought about tire technology and how it’s always evolved with cars, I appreciate the creativity of your post. That being said, newer cars have insane computational power going into ensuring that traction is maintained. Electric cars may be faster and have instant torque compared to their ICE counterparts, but they’re also putting the power down better and more efficiently (traction-wise, I don’t want to start an argument behind net emissions here). 

I actually think tire consumption will decrease due to this increased efficiency in traction overall. On a side note, I think this chip shortage has opened people’s eyes to how modern cars are really just rolling computers. Most everything is being monitored, calculated, and acted on in real time. It’s pretty remarkable, albeit annoying for us DIY guys who’re left debugging electrical/software issues.",abutteredbiscuit,9,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/olcjkm/why_i_think_michelin_could_be_a_good_longterm_play/h5djtzy/,0.068,0.737,0.195,0.9618
