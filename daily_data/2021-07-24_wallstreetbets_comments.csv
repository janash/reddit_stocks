The national debt is a very misunderstood topic since most people see it the same way you see debt from a credit card. The reality is is that’s vastly more complicated and more in common with your mortgage (healthy economic activity) than your credit card. 

National debt is mostly owned by Americans. This is done through bonds a lot of the time. And they’re considered safe long term investments. To pay the debt off would be to halt investment in the US government, which is bad. This also applies to forgoing countries who see the US dollar as a safe form of investment. 

The coronavirus has tested the strength of the US debt. It’s far more sound than economists gave it credit for. The debt didn’t default even after GDP dropped like a lead balloon last year.

3. Does the DD present a bullish AND bearish thesis? Everything comes with risk/reward and these need to be stated to come to a justified decision.

As a matter of fact, sometimes the best times to position yourself in a stock are at times of uncertainty. If someone claims to KNOW that some retarded ticker is gonna print you millions, they don’t. Nobody knows. 

All we can do is speculate. But with that being said I have read some incredible DD on this subreddit and a lot of them tend to be the ones with the lesser upvotes.

Avoid the bagholder DD, and do your own. At the very least look at their financials. Doesn’t even have to be complicated. Just go on Nasdaq and find their quarterly EPS. If it’s positive, good, if it’s negative, find out why. If the ‘why’ is bad take it off the watchlist.",ilovefiftyfifty,146,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oqngq7/manipulation_girls_do_it_shit_posters_do_it/h6d53wa/,0.075,0.825,0.1,0.4234

If they're $15 out of the money on a 0DTE option they're probably trying to pump the stock to save their ass.

&#x200B;

If they bought 10,000 shares at X price check when the stock was that price. If they've been in the red for the last 2 months they're probably trying to get rid of the bag.

&#x200B;

Does the DD have any actual DD in it? Or is it just ""You should buy this because I think it's good""? Does it show financials, does it present the bear case and risks for a balanced view?

Out of my initial startup 100K capital I started playing with about 10% on 500 - 1000 dollar bets and I am bag holding on all of them. Most of them are down between 30 to 90% Most of my money is invested in real estate or in private businesses that I have a stake in But with the pandemic I decided to learn more about investing in stocks and options both for the excitement and for the possibility for rapid gains. But first I had to learn that it also means possibility of rapid losses. Cheering for a stock that you hold and are hoping to make money
 regardless of any actual underlying fundamentals is fun for me. I’m already holding the bag so I figure well at least get some thrill out of owning it. Like I paid hundreds of dollars for a good seat at the game.

I learned a lot from this about how to figure out when people are pumping something or making the DD fit their thesis. Often in the comments section I will get better hints and leads on ideas. I often find these commenters are the most reserved and brief.

Some of the DD would be someone who did not get a lot of upvotes or positive comments. Those he did I would look at their post history as well. I would look up the company they’re talking about and they’ve never really been mentioned here but the poster has a history of posting DD in advance of what turned out to be a good play and then got more buzz, as did their positive commenters. Of course more buzz only once it started printing and then from people with a much more checkered history.  AVPT is a recent example.

Shorts have become somehow a BAD thing... it's odd because when a Business has a failing business model or is poorly managed it is really the Shorts that assist that Business in either restructuring or liquidating.

Because as we all know this job does not make enough to raise a family and buy a house etc.    The information being feed to people is a TWISTED TRUTH --- yes if AMC closed up people would lose their jobs.

Without the sheep that are using their funds and consistently buying said DIP waiting for the SHORT SQUEEZE to come, the stock would be worth it's normal market value.

Shorts have become somehow a BAD thing... it's odd because when a Business has a failing business model or is poorly managed it is really the Shorts that assist that Business in either restructuring or liquidating.

As for the whole movement that states that they saved jobs etc.   How many people are working at AMC as a CAREER move?   Because as we all know this job does not make enough to raise a family and buy a house etc.    The information being feed to people is a TWISTED TRUTH --- yes if AMC closed up people would lose their jobs.   But the movement is making it out like they have actually saved something of MEGA Value.

As for those people telling people to BUY THE DIP and HODL etc.   Below is examples of the kind hearted, genius day traders with brilliant plays with Tech and Scientific info...

Here is an example of why YouTubers who are looking for money to take their courses ETC are a major issue and causing huge problems for normal people.

135,HUGE," Without normal retail investors buying shares in things that are called out by the soooo called GOOD PEOPLE -- the stock would stay at it's regular market levels.

282,ESS," Lucid is a buy and hold long-term for me. This isn't a quickie, it's an early retirement stock for me. They have a decent business model. Sell luxury  cars and be a tier1 for cheaper cars. Luxury market has less competition than economy market. Lucid will be a awesome tier1. They have been selling battery tech for decades. They even supply all the batteries for formula-E. 

The reason I want to hold long-term is because of their ESS division. Countries and states needs to stabilize their grids. The need for energy storage is huge. CA alone has 30B in the pipeline for stabilizing the grid and Energy storage plays a key part. This is going to be significant revenue for Lucid.

287,ICE," I think another important factor for Lucid is that their CEO understand that this is a technology race. Car companies have been stagnant for decades. The industry needed a rich fanatical nut to come along and disrupt things and Elon Musk was kind enough to do that. He disrupted an established stagnant industry. Now Tesla can't keep up with demand. Traditional car makers are coming up with half-assed EVs so they can say ""we have an EV too"". But Toyota's infotainment is still shit. Their driving assist features are basic. Wireless Apple CarPlay has been out for almost a decade and no one but BMW bothered with it. Tesla is taking modern technology and putting it into cars. That's why Tesla is a threat to traditional car makers. And now Lucid is too. Lucid is a long way behind Tesla, but I think Tesla has gone a bit too far with their insanity. Tesla broke the ice, but they seem more focused on selling hype now. Fudging numbers. Making wild promises. They're over promising and under delivering now. But the momentum is there now for EVs to replace ICE vehicles. Tesla could fall behind and if so, Lucid is the next in line that understands this is about bringing modern technology into vehicles and not just about propelling your car with batteries.",matterball,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oqpuk4/lucid_motors_will_trade_under_ticker_lcid/h6elhvh/,0.102,0.829,0.069,-0.8797

Standstill traffic is where EVs shine, they actually get MORE efficient.  80 mph highway is where EVs get less efficient (that and winter heating).

A/C consumes almost no power compared to what is required to actually move the car.  Usually 1 kWh per 4-5 miles whereas an AC system will use 2 kW for an entire hour of cooling time, so 2 kWh in total.

Meaning an entire hour of A/C is equivalent to 15 miles of driving.

They don't just drain power while sitting in traffic, that's utter nonsense. And the AC is suprisingly efficient. I only really notice faster battery drain when I have my AC cranked to level 10 (which I never do, becuase the AC itself cools the car very well).

381,UBS," Did you just link a clip from ""the big short""? Seriously? I liked the movie too but it doesn't cover everything. It's kind of like scientologists using L Ron Hubbard books to guide their lives. It's a little more involved then classic WSB meme fuel.

And even if what you're trying to say it's in any way true, relevant and not a strawman it's completely besides the point.

So no, it's not at all like when Mark met a CDO manager in some movie. Not even remotely close

This is how it works:

The growth in the sector exemplifies human interest. It's a road sign, a marker. There's also a consequence to that interest both positive and negative.

China announcing restrictive regulations and a huge dump in the sector represents, again, human interest and willingness to be involved. The market is a way for a business to seek capital to grow.

Essentially EMH showed that people noped the fuck out of that trade.

These companies now do not have access to those markets and therefore that capital bc of immediate and restrictive regulation. The regulation prohibits tutoring companies from listing publicly and foreign investment. Also, people, investors, don't want to be involved if the heavy hand of the CCP is present.

Now let's skip over the part where the CCP just fucked everyone holding these equities which includes: UBS, Morgan Stanley, credit suisse, Barclays, Canadian pension funds, blackrock, vanguard mutual funds, and on and on and on. 

So what you say it's just the rich getting fucked? Well the middle class has their retirements in those sorts of funds. It's also where liquidity might be stored for lending purposes, can be used as collateral and the million other things assets provide as a service. Big money didn't lose here, you and I did they made a profit either way.

Ok so we'll ignore that and ignore that the only people who made money were people lucky enough to be short like citron and the multitude of Chinese investment firms that no doubt benefited from the trade going their way.

What this regulation disallows: pubic investment via stock exchanges, foreign investment, tutoring on weekends and vacations. This was all done by a government agency created just a month ago. The Chinese have a wonderful history with task forces
/s

It does allow ""private"" investment from Chinese Nationals.

So now these companies no longer have access to the money they used to operate, which bought materials, technology, supplies and paid tutors and are likely forced to provide material that their benefactors allow. They're no longer allowed to tutor when it might've been most convenient for both the tutor and family receiving extra education. 

This will bring down the quality of the tutoring and likely raise the price of better education which only the already wealthy can afford.

So what were you saying about how it's unimportant that this sector was booming?",whatisliquidity,9,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oqrzcf/china_bans_forprofit_school_tutoring_in_sweeping/h6e7cs8/,0.101,0.741,0.157,0.9837

383,USA," [r/baba](www.reddit.com/r/baba)

What happened today:

China: We are “discussing” reducing the burden on parents for tutoring and schooling services including mandating less homework and lower tutoring fees. I’m addition, we are discussing moving tutoring corporations to non-profits to reduce the price gauging on the educational system in China to support the disparity in those who can and can’t afford tutoring.


USA ($1T in student debt btw): China wants you to lose all your money, they love it. They will nationalize all companies and make everything free!!!!


What’s really going on: Xi just wants a healthy economy in China. This is not about investors or people trading options. It’s about supporting the Chinese people, businesses, and financial system. Reducing crazy tutoring costs. Reducing monopolies that destroy small businesses. Reducing financial risk by putting al the loan risk on banks (ant group). This is not about destroying investors, it’s about improving the life of Chinese people. The media and FUD is insane but typical of US.

The thing is SBUX hit a recent high of $118 in early April. Traded down to about 110 then consolidated since May until about last week. Rallied hard on CMG earnings. CMG had a similar move since April. Peak to trough since April, CMG moved 36%.

Yeah it is.

I think most people who talk about the weed business dont live in legal states with active rec markets.

The money is in the paraphenalia, not the product.

To the degree their is money in product its in concentrates and processed items like edibles.

The producers themselves make a living, but dont generate large amounts of revenue.

TLRY is more a real estate play than a weed play, and it isnt a very good real estate play.

Do whatever you want, but jesus fuck, it isnt a conspiracy, its the way its been since like, what, 2018 was the Canadian legalization and it sold the new hard? Sector wide?

It only works when 'they' have their pants down and you the Apes focus their efforts.

The weed stock boom already happened, all the stocks mooned and crashed years ago. TLRY is a real estate scam, and was one of the most iconic pump and dumps of the group, racing to 300 and then collapsing.

They couldnt get private investors due to legal roadblocks, and so they turned to the public, but in reality need a continuous stream of revenue to grow into a real business.

This is why dilution is needed, because they have too little revenue.

Farmers have never been rich people, and that wont magically change because its weed.

If you want a weed play go for Scott's, they produce the General Hydroponics brand used for home growers, which is a business model that works no matter the status of major grow operations.
