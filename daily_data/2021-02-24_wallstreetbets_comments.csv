72,CEO," Current RC plan: 
1. don’t say shit
2. Buy the dip starting March 1st. (edit to March 15-20 to start buying his 7% he's allowed to purchase per RC Ventures agreement)
3. Announce new shares purchased through disclosure. 
4. Release Q4 earnings with profit 
5. Announce RC as new CEO on earnings call. 
6. ???
7. Profit

Edit: I’m saying he’ll start buying around March 1st to build his extra 6% position. If GME hits profits, which is expected, the price will jump. Just not sure if he can scoop 7% up and announce or if he’s required to announce before buying additional shares. But if he takes 7% of shares off the float and it hits profit, that would help squeeze up even harder. I’m just theorizing what he’s going to do to cause shorts maximum pain and increase his investment in a sustainable, long term way to earn trust of shareholders and board members. If he makes the board money, he’ll have free reign to do as he pleases.

Edit 2 - 13D filings are required within 10 days according to the SEC (https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/investing-basics/glossary/schedules-13d-and-13g)

That means if I'm him, I'm actually going to start buying closer to the 12-16th of March (12 days prior to earnings which date isn't announced) to coincide the announcement to the SEC with earnings. The SEC doesn't state terms, so I'd assume it's 10 days from settlement of the purchase, not initiation, so on T+2, he's at 12 days. That means he has roughly 12 days to buy up 7% of GME shares prior to earnings. I'll bet this is when he loads up as I think it will be the last time shares are this cheap again. 

But with that, keep in mind that he's going to be keeping his mouth shut. He wants shares as cheaply as possible, especially if he's buying roughly 4.9m of them, which I truly don't think will happen. If you paper hand it now, you're losses are well deserved and your shares will go towards giving our lord and savior cheaper shares. Take solace in knowing your paperhands are boosting RC's bottom line. 

My bet: He buys 2m more shares pre-earnings and at a later date is given a stock bonus deal similar to Elon.",brizzybrew,2882,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lqtsep/gme/goit39k/,0.028,0.819,0.154,0.9927

That means he has roughly 12 days to buy up 7% of GME shares prior to earnings. I'll bet this is when he loads up as I think it will be the last time shares are this cheap again. 

But with that, keep in mind that he's going to be keeping his mouth shut. He wants shares as cheaply as possible, especially if he's buying roughly 4.9m of them, which I truly don't think will happen. If you paper hand it now, you're losses are well deserved and your shares will go towards giving our lord and savior cheaper shares. Take solace in knowing your paperhands are boosting RC's bottom line.

74,RC," Current RC plan: 
1. don’t say shit
2. Buy the dip starting March 1st. (edit to March 15-20 to start buying his 7% he's allowed to purchase per RC Ventures agreement)
3. Announce new shares purchased through disclosure. 
4. Release Q4 earnings with profit 
5. Announce RC as new CEO on earnings call. 
6. ???
7. Profit

Edit: I’m saying he’ll start buying around March 1st to build his extra 6% position. If GME hits profits, which is expected, the price will jump. Just not sure if he can scoop 7% up and announce or if he’s required to announce before buying additional shares. But if he takes 7% of shares off the float and it hits profit, that would help squeeze up even harder. I’m just theorizing what he’s going to do to cause shorts maximum pain and increase his investment in a sustainable, long term way to earn trust of shareholders and board members. If he makes the board money, he’ll have free reign to do as he pleases.

Edit 2 - 13D filings are required within 10 days according to the SEC (https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/investing-basics/glossary/schedules-13d-and-13g)

\-SI report will come out tonight, and it will probably show the same as what we've been seeing with short interest and number of shorted shares, which bodes well for the prophesized MOASS. Yes the report is 2 weeks delayed, no its not super reliable, blah blah we know, but its still news.

\-Conan O'Brien tweeted yesterday that he FINALLY gave in and bought some GME stock, which is good publicity and lends to the positive momentum!

There's probably more driving this but thats all I can think of right now

155,DD," Reminder retards. During a shortsqueeze the daily stock value isnt an important or interesting metric.

​

The interesting metrics are: - Volume (should be low on down spikes) - Short interest - Short vs float - Short percentage - Catalysts that provoke a need to cover and other such indicators of scarcity of stock supply.

​

Nothing else matters. **The importance of the pricepoint between now and the squeeze is seriously almost ZERO. Green days dont matter, nor do reds.**

​

I know you smooth brains are used to looking at ""green good"" ""red bad"" AND that you all have the attention spans of hamsters which makes you question valid DD because ""why no print money yet, boring"" but with volume so low and so little circulation its easy to make the line do funny things.

​

Know the DD, and know what a fucking shortsqueeze is and how it works before you panic about nothing. Its actually dangerous being uninformed. It leads you to make poor (financial) decisions, opens you up to being receptive to misinformation and unintentionally makes you have a bad effect on the mindset of others that are also less than optimally informed.

​

During or leading up to the point of a shortsqueeze it is NOT buying that gets the price up like in normal market situations. So dont focus on it

​

Dont beg for whales to come help buy.

Dont beg DFV to post (for some reason?!)

Dont look at red numbers and doubt the underlying DD that you did before investing (Right? RIGHT?)

Dont overcelebrate green moments or days like Jesus' second coming.

​

**The moonshot in a shortsqueeze situation comes from endless demand impulse when shorts are required to cover, combined with unavailability of shares to do so with because theyre owned by shareholders. This means that holding a certain percentage suffices, although increasing also increases pressure and squeeze leverage.**

​

In such a situation a bullshit instant gratification attitude would be bad. I encourage everyone who has invested or is planning to actually read up on what a shortsqueeze is because otherwise you'd falsely assume everyone is just randomly shouting ""hold"" and ""it will come"".

​

187,GME," Something incredible is happening with GME the last few trading days, and it's a big deal. 100,000 shorts were covered in pre market Monday which drove the price up by 13%. They were then immediately loaned out again shortly after open which lowered the price back to $43 almost instantly. Over the next few hours it went back up to $45. The move to $45 was all retail. Whichever hedge fund tried flipping those 100,000 shorts is currently losing money AND retail traders now own that stock. Retail is gaining control over more and more of the GME float. 75% of them are losing interest and paper handing as soon as they realize it's not going hyperbolic yet, but the 25% of 💎🖐 who intend to hold are gaining ground. The more retail owns, the more they control the price they're willing to sell it for. They have gained a ton of ground the last few days even if it doesn't look like it on the price. Retail is becoming aware of this and yesterday morning, when 100,000 more shorts entered the market they were bought up almost immediately. You can see that event as the two giant candles at opening yesterday. We'd gain ground a lot faster if people quit lying and saying ""it's about to moon! Here we go!""

Nobody knows how long it'll be before it moons. The longer it takes the higher it'll go, as long as upward pressure is maintained, and retail buys hedge fund shares at a discount when they're lent into the market. 💎🖐 need to understand this and help all the 🧻🖐 retards FUDing about understand it too. Enough people are holding for a squeeze, but if more people understood what's really going on we could get the upward pressure we need to trigger it.

Watch this chart like a hawk. When borrowed shares are sold, Buy them. That's how we win.

Additional details

If you look at the chart at that link you'll see the number of shares available to borrow rose from 1 million to 1.1 million in pre market monday; then back to 1 million shortly after open. 100,000 short positions were covered and then immediately re opened. However, there was also 800,000 additional shares that were made available to borrow at 11:30, but those weren't the result of shorts being covered. We would've seen an insane spike in the price if that was the case. Some whale must've just simply decided to make their shares available to borrow. DFV's 50,000 share purchase, resulted in a 5% spike in price on Friday; 100,000 shorts covering in pre market caused a 13% spike Monday, and a 13% dip that immediately rebounded Tuesday. We're now beginning to get a clearer picture on the mechanics of this stock and it's better than anyone thought. Interestingly, it actually doesn't look like there are any whales involved on retail's side anymore. Turns out retail really has been holding the line this entire time. All they have to do now is snag up those discount shares when they're lent into the market.",jaboyles,320,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lre2k6/gme_megathread_for_wednesday_february_24th_2021/gol32rg/,0.048,0.857,0.096,0.9814

We saw it once, shorts are still around 70 - 85%, we are going to see it again, and this time robinhood can't say they weren't prepared, there is no excuse. This happening while the hearings are occurring, this is going to totally fuck over the big boys. 

Oh and incase you're wondering, I like the stock. 250@$47

Literally shaking with anger at TD Ameritrade right now.

I'm diamondhands on GME. My husband is learning stocks. He bought at high. Wanted to set a small limit order to sell just a few shares for 350, and keep his other shares. We need the money, so I told him go ahead.

Went on TD Ameritrade. Limit order rejected over and over and over. He asked me to look at it. Got that ""significantly higher than current share price, please confirm that this is the correct security"" message. So I called TD AMERITRADE. Stuck on hold for half an hour. Finally ""Mason,"" answers.

General Summary of our conversation:

""Hello, my husbands limit order keeps being rejected. Can you tell me why?""

Mason: Well, it's significantly higher than the current share price.

Me: But it's pretty near the price at which my husband purchased it. So it seems reasonable.

Mason: If you place a limit that high, it's probably never going to get filled.

Me: That's fine. It's my money. It's my choice. If it doesn't get filled, that's fine by me. My money, my decision. So, can you place the limit order for me?

Mason: No.

Me: Okay . . . what limit order am I ""allowed"" to place?

Mason: \*hesitates\* It has to be within 100 points.

Me: Can you just tell me the number? What is the share price that I'm ""allowed"" to set for a limit order?

Mason: $150 is the max.

Me: That's disappointing, because I have a limit order several thousand on the same stock onetrade. So I guess I no longer want to do business with Ameritrade.

Mason: (clearly upset) Why? Why would you WANT to place a limit order that high if it's never going to get filled? It's completely unreasonable!!!

Me: Well, GME hit 350 in premarket this morning so it doesn't seem unreasonable at all to me.

Mason: ......

&#x200B;

Sooooo . . .  there is no free market. Your money. Your taxes. But you're not allowed to choose your own limit orders. How is this legal? Is this legal? How is this still going on?

And why are you allowed to buy at 350, but not to sell at 350?

318,GME," OP also thought GME would hit 10,000 so hopefully the autists understand this is a false prophet. 

Reality check for the libertarians here: QE IS NOT NECESSARILY INFLATIONARY.

Let’s say Apple wants to issue a $105 bond for May 2021 for $100 in May 2020. 5% return. An investment bank or pension fund or bond fund will buy the bond for 100. Then the government wants to increase the money supply right now so they buy the $105 promised note for 104 in June 2020. There is now $104 more in existence than before because the feds printed it and bought the bond with it. However Apple will have to pay $105 to whoever holds the bond (the fed reserve) in May 2021. The feds get the cash from Apple and the spread of $1 is in now in the reserve. The move was upfront inflationary yes but long term deflationary by $1. This is why post 2008 we saw very little inflation.",throwawayamd14,61,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lr8h1v/why_father_burry_is_calling_the_big_short_20_i/goksgwj/,0.007,0.941,0.052,0.6537

323,GDP," Given the unemployment rate, it would seem that the US is still far from operating at maximum capacity which would in turn mean that the additional aggregate demand generated from that additional stimulus checks would be unlikely to tilt it towards inflation territory just yet.

Even if there were to be inflation, it seems unlikely to spiral out of control given that the devaluation of USD is likely to be accompanied by both increased foreign investments and exports due to a more competitive exchange rate (i.e. accompanying GDP growth).

Wouldn't this then bring us closer to scenario 2 which would mean that in the near term, nothing much would change, and that we just have to prepare for the eventual revolution",hoolala123,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lr8h1v/why_father_burry_is_calling_the_big_short_20_i/goko3aw/,0.036,0.931,0.033,-0.079

I know we're a smaller economy, but things haven't blown up due to the recovery benefits here.  It seems kind of silly to think one $1400 cheque will having far reaching implications on the global the economy while many other countries have been doing this for months already.

Also one thing that seems lacking from this post is the idea of resumption of normal economic function when Covid-19 subsides. Is the economy going to collapse and go into a hyperinflated state because finally people are making money again and buying shit? That seems stupid and backwards.

Of course, hollowing out the country is terrible for long-term prospects and makes everything more fragile, but the notion that things will collapse within the lifetime of the boomers is far-fetched.

Of course, maybe this is the year that California finally gets hit by the Big One and NYC/Florida/Texas flood, while the Northwest burns and the middle of the country turns into Dust Bowl v2.

He was appointed by Dennis Pence, CEO of Coldwater to ""return the company to profitability"" as CFO in 2009 (till 2014) but then Jim Bell did nothing but pile on more and more debt on Coldwater according to wikipedia.

From 2009 to July 2012 ColdWater did nothing but see RED and losing money, business was tanking due to ""poor management"". In 2012 Coldwater had to borrow $65million from Golden Gate Capital. GGC is a private equity firm run by a guy named David Dominik. The deal was assisted by a recovering Hedge Fund company at the time 'Citadel LLC' Oh and guess who graduated from Harvard with David Dominik? Kenneth Griffin \*GEE THATS INTERESTING\*

Going on - After getting the money boost from GGC - the company had a death spiral and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2014. Guess who got a nice big fat farewell bonus? Mr. Jim Bell.

From there he went to PF Changs from 2016 to 2019. Which he ALSO ran into the ground see this - [https://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/news/2019/01/13/p-f-changs-set-to-be-sold-for-700-million-report.html](https://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/news/2019/01/13/p-f-changs-set-to-be-sold-for-700-million-report.html)

So checking into how PF Changs went from profitable to accumulating debt and tanking.... I come up blank but something was ""mismanaged"" \*cough Jim Bell's MO\*

PF Chang was sold off and all it's board members got a nice big farewell bonus.

Then Jim was hired on to GameStop \*FUCKING WHY???\* and wow somehow Gamestop was already kinda a pile of shit before Jim got on board but once he was confirmed CFO in June 2019, the FTDs on GameStop TRIPLED the following month and continued to climb and accumulate.

I dont know what this all means but it's not a stretch that Jim Bell was doing shady shit with the HFs.

So in conclusion the firing of Jim Bell is GOOD and VERY BULLISH.

This is all publicly available via facebook, linkedin, wikipedia and google. So Jim Bell started his career by taking ColdWater Inc to the fucking cleaners. He was appointed by Dennis Pence, CEO of Coldwater to ""return the company to profitability"" as CFO in 2009 (till 2014) but then Jim Bell did nothing but pile on more and more debt on Coldwater according to wikipedia.

From 2009 to July 2012 ColdWater did nothing but see RED and losing money, business was tanking due to ""poor management"". In 2012 Coldwater had to borrow $65million from Golden Gate Capital. GGC is a private equity firm run by a guy named David Dominik. The deal was assisted by a recovering Hedge Fund company at the time 'Citadel LLC' Oh and guess who graduated from Harvard with David Dominik? Kenneth Griffin *GEE THATS INTERESTING*

Going on - After getting the money boost from GGC - the company had a death spiral and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2014. Guess who got a nice big fat farewell bonus? Mr. Jim Bell.

From there he went to PF Changs from 2016 to 2019. Which he ALSO ran into the ground see this - https://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/news/2019/01/13/p-f-changs-set-to-be-sold-for-700-million-report.html

So checking into how PF Changs went from profitable to accumulating debt and tanking.... I come up blank but something was ""mismanaged"" *cough Jim Bell's MO*

PF Chang was sold off and all it's board members got a nice big farewell bonus.

Then Jim was hired on to GameStop *FUCKING WHY???* and wow somehow Gamestop was already kinda a pile of shit before Jim got on board but once he was confirmed CFO in June 2019, the FTDs on GameStop TRIPLED the following month and continued to climb and accumulate.

I dont know what this all means but it's not a stretch that Jim Bell was doing shady shit with the HFs.

So in conclusion the firing of Jim Bell is GOOD and VERY BULLISH.

596,ANY," When you buy a stock, it takes 2 (I think) days after day of sale for the stock to actually be delivered. The reason you can trade that stock before it settles is because your broker either fronts it or this settlement time. Think of it the same way you can trade on margin using instant deposits (broker fronting money). They have two days to get the stock to then send it to who you sold it to. This would reduce the amount of time before someone can be punished for not providing the asset they sold.

This isn’t including failure to delivers of course, but would make them significantly more apparent when they happen (GME has had significant failures to deliver for months now, for example, and is part of why people think there may be counterfeit).

I am new to active trading (~few months) compared to a couple bonds through the years, so I may not have the entire idea captured here. But yeah I think this is good?

Some of the DD's here also carry some old news or events in the DD.  Again, in my opinion only, these should be marked as such.  Like a ""(this happened 2 years ago)"" before the paragraph or after the paragraph to acknowledge ""not a current event"".

Some of the tactics here are to catch a dumb ass, which is fine because it really is the responsibility of the investor to know their investment moves.  That being said, there are those that are weak in knowledge of investing and have serious funds to invest.

We did not expect to have as much fun as we had.

Roblox is like a mini custom game ecosystem-- with a universal micro transaction payment system spanning all the content in the library. It benefits both content creators and the company running the platform itself. The engine is highly scriptable. Remember the golden age of Blizzards Warcraft 3 custom games that gave birth to entire game genres like MOBAs? This is that, but monetized.

Kids are hopping in and out of all sorts of types of games, some have MTX and some do not. Even as a group of 26 year old dudes, we found a game in there that gave us more smiles per mile than comparable AAA FPS games that cost millions. The creators are small, independent developers, some even kids themselves that also encourages growth in software development and scripting.

768,USA," Only signed up to try etoro not long ago.It was only $200 initial deposit, $50 later I that accepted.

What I hadn't expected as it was advertised you could even buy fraction shares with them was only after adding funds did I find it's $50 min buy in on any trade even including expanding your position, so even if you have funds that can cover a cheap unit, or multiple cheap units, if it's less than $50 in the account then you have to put in another $50, then you're left with under $50 again and it keeps rolling on.

The dialog itself idiotically and falsely says things like ""Deposit $15 in order to set this order"" except you literally can't deposit $15 can you.

As someone new into this with very limited funds to use with this currently, and not expecting this to change any time soon trading unless exceptionally lucky, this sucks. And now with multiple counts of down time even in these few weeks it just seems a bad platform.

At least for me, the service works OK. During the Peak of GME Mania, it was very similar to Robinhood, a lot of shady decisions, forced stop loss in my case (was refunded though, but still).

My last withdrawal 3 weeks ago took 3-4 days (wiretransfer) and the minimum deposit is 50$ (42€).

The platofrm itself is very simple and not very advanced, but it gets the job done.

839,GME," 42 shares of GME in eToro?

Run, that is all. Prepare yourself to sell and buy (in another broker) again the fastest you can. I had 7 shares from GME, and one they they just close my positions, and as a lot of people saild, there is not way to contact the customer service. Only copy paste messages about criptos. 

If you sell and buy more or less at the same time, you will not lose shares. But something is true. Remember 5$ comission for taking you money, and +7 days without knowing a shit about your money. 

I recommend you not to wait, and move as fast as possible.

887,UK," Yup. Love IG, they provide direct market access on LSE and an ISA which no one else seems to offer at the moment. However Fineco bank has a banner on their website saying they're introducing an ISA next tax year so that's where I'm going in April (they have DMA on their general traing accounts so I assume the ISAs will have it too).

£2.95 commission for UK stocks or $3.95 for US stocks, which will probably be crazy to track but it kind of makes sense. Either way IG charge £8 per trade down to £3 if you make enough trades each month, so the commission is definitely competitive between the two.

There are no annual account charges for having an account and no inactivity fee on Fineco. IG do charge a quarterly account fee that is free if you make 3+ trades a quarter and they do charge an inactivity fee after 2 years of being inactive.

From what I've read Fineco's platform is just as good so I'm excited to move over. IG is still good but the restrictions killed it for me. Also their site constantly went down around 2:30pm during those days in January (when nyse opened), which is why they stopped people signing up as well.

2. Ride sharing

3. Tesla Solar/Power

4. Tesla HVAC (happening 2021-2022)

5. Tesla EV Jet (Elon has shown interest, but is too busy right now now to dedicate any time (so as one the upper level items start getting closed out, more time gets freed up form bottom items))

6. Tesla has a materials research partnership with SpaceX (this has profound implications for the entire Tesla business in both directions)

7. SpaceX *will* likely contract Tesla for off-world rovers and vehicles for Mars since Tesla's by nature can be modified to become hermetically sealed vehicles reasonably quickly. Additionally, when Tesla semis go online, repurposing them for Mars exploration would be ""relatively"" easy.

980,DD," Tesla's real value that most people discount is the part they play in beyond Earth should SpaceX succeed with Starship. Everyone continues to treat the company as a stand alone entity that is in the car market. That's wrong and too short sighted.

Tesla takes up *most* of Elon's time, with Boring, Neuralink and SpaceX taking up the rest; SpaceX being the 2nd order in that list. Every Elon does and I mean ***everything*** is for Mars only. He has gone on record that he would like to die as an old man on Mars. So when you look at Tesla's market position and the things it does, and are looking to invest in said company, you need to do your DD with how it matters *for* Mars.

Earth is literally, to excuse the pun, a vehicle, to achieve his Mars ambition. So the market evaluation of this and that compared to Toyota or Ford or GM or whatever, in my book, is wholly *irrelevant.* Can any of those companies retool their production lines to take existing cars, modify the design 20-25% and be able to punt them to the Moon or Mars? Can those vehicle operate in a foreign environment at scale? If yes? They matter in this conversation. If no, they don't matter nearly as much as anyone thinks.

Also, most of the big institutions holding Tesla are holding Tesla long. Additionally, the majority of retail Tesla holders are almost entirely long positions. Finally, and most importantly, SpaceX's Falcon Heavy maiden launch put Elon's cherry red roadster into a 100 million year orbit around the sun. The car was mostly unmodified. It ran for 14-18 hours sending back a 1080p livestream from orbit and beyond Earth orbit for everyone to see.

Most will see this and dismiss it as a stunt, while other players will look and this and say ""holy shit, Tesla vehicles can function in hard vacuum with zero modification.""

SpaceX already uses Tesla car batteries and power train motors for their Starship development platform, internal electricals, and some of the actuators on the prototype vessel. It's almost guaranteed then that SpaceX will contract Tesla downstream for batteries, hvac, and autonomous driving capabilities for rovers and other vehicles for Moon/Mars.

991,TV," Yeah, definitely. I think there can be some potential in the if they decide to shift more attention towards movie and TV business. I can't say for sure they want that in the long run but I can see them being a direct competitor to Disney in the next decade or so should they go that route. When I was watching the tour of the theme Park with Shigeru Miyamoto, he seemed very energized and passionate about expanding on the park and delivering an expereince to anyone who will go to the park in the future. Shigeru created Mario, The Legend of Zelda, Donkey Kong and had an influence on the creator of Pokemon, Satoshi Tajiri so he knows how to create and inspire household names. Mario is recognized around the world now and can be the ""Mikey Mouse"" of Nintendo. He went as far as calling himself Mario's dad in the theme park tour I was watching, so he may want the legacy he has built with Nintendo to continue living on. It may be in the cards for them but will take some time to get started on the TV and movie business and to then catch attention like Disney has. For now that's how I look at it.

1027,GME," i told my dad last week that I was just still holding on to some shares after the crazy shitstorm, and that I managed to salvage some profits on the way up originally, and didn't do a wash sale or anything. my overall portfolio was up like, 15% YoY as a result of my small GME position that I rode up and down, and managed to take some cash out of before it came all the way back down to $45. I was out quite a lot on the remaining shares I had, but I told him I was just gonna hold them forever basically as they were pretty much ""free"" shares at this point given what I managed to take off the table early on during the first two days of runup. 

I was like, ""maybe the game is completely rigged and the squeeze won't ever happen... idgaf. I'm not selling these for anything less than like $120, and I expect organic growth will see this stock at $80 by end of year, squeeze or no squeeze.""

1107,GME," I went through a similar thing. My dog started limping and I had to do the surgery for his knee, I was billed $3600 that I didn’t really have and had to sign up for a credit card to finance it interest-free, made monthly payments of $300, which of course was unplanned expenses. This was early November.

GME really helped make things up, I was able to pay everything off with it and even bought back some shares afterwards so I’m not a complete paper hand bitch (holding strong with 15 shares at $164.33...yeah....). 

Hopefully your dog is doing better. Mine took a while to recover, about 3 months to look back to normal, but now he has/had a limp on his other leg for a day or two and it went away. I’m gonna get it checked out to find out if his other knee didn’t go through the same thing. The problem with the surgery is how much they have to compensate the weight with the other leg, and it’s apparently pretty common the other knee goes to. Just be really careful about his movements, weight, don’t leave him anywhere he could climb or step on, and hopefully he never has to see a surgery table again.",GimmeSomeCovfefe,9,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lr2wvg/the_wallstreetbets_gamestop_hype_helped_this_guy/gok8xrv/,0.047,0.854,0.099,0.8772

1109,PT," My dog had TWO. COUNT THEM TWO tplo surgeries. I went into $20k worth of debt for it. She’s a giant pyr mix, so tplo was my only option. 

But it was worth every penny of it.  She had one trick- sit for a treat. She can’t do that now cause her knees are sore from the surgeries. But that’s ok. We are about 3 years out and she’s doing great. 

DO NOT SKIMP ON THE PT. if you have access to a swimming option for PT that is best. But short walks up inclines (on leash) works too.

She’s a worthless money pit basically. But she pays me back in barking at strangers (constantly) and more cuddles than I’d ever want. 

Congrats fam.

Edit. For everyone in the thread that needs dog surgery- make sure you confirm with your vet that pain control is appropriate and in the plan.

Once you accept the fact that you have no control, you can ironically start making smarter moves in that you decide based on what is right for your finances, not following others, because they don't have your interests in mind. 

I bought gold when it was ""cheap"" and everyone said it was a dead end. It went up 35% from what I put into it despite being the opposite advice most financial ""experts"" tell their followers. My actual income however comes directly from running a business.

1168,GME," That's not really a good way to look at stocks though, because to ""correctly"" act upon it you would have to know the future. You will never get perfect efficiency. The goal is just that you pick stocks for a specific reason and you don't panic sell, you sell specifically to profit. You don't need to sell at the absolute high to still make money.

I know so many people where when it dips, they sell because they second guess themselves, and then a month later it goes back up to their goal. I think success in stocks depends on one admitting that you have zero control over the market, and you are committed to ride the wave when you buy a ticket, and you take whatever profit you get, and not get greedy.

I have come to the conclusion that I should just buy a big ass dartboard, print tickers for every symbol on the NYSE and then just throw darts at it a few times a week so I can lose money that way.

It sounds a lot more fun tbh. Maybe I could throw a blindfold into the mix just to make sure I don’t start actually trying to aim for shit to affect results.

If this post gets a hunnid upvotes I’ll actually do this with a few grand but I have a feeling sourcing a big ass dartboard will be hard.

Our connecting flight was in Philly so if you know that airport we had to take a shuttle to get to the other terminals.

1571,HAL," Each contract = 100 shares. So, even though the price is ""$3.70/contract"", your buy price is $370 for 1 contract (which gives you the option to purchase 100 shares at a later date). So, buying 20 contracts will cost you $7,400 ($370 x 20). Now you have bought 20 contracts that expire on Jan. 21, 2022 at a strike price of $22.50. But remember, you purchased these options at $3.70 a piece...so your break even is really $26.20 ($22.50 + $3.70). So HAL would need to hit $26.20 by January 21, 2022 in order for you to break even. That is the basics of it. However, there are a number of other things you need to consider when buying options. Such as: you don't need to hold to expiration. Let's say HAL gets to $25 by April 15, 2021. Your option contract will very likely now be valued at much higher than the $3.70 that you paid. You can sell it off early, very likely for a nice profit (assuming there is trading volume on it). You need to look at the options chain, the volume, and learn something called the Greeks (theta, vega, gamma, delta, etc.). Also be sure to learn about IV (implied volatility) as this heavily impacts the value of options contracts, specifically when it comes to short dated options (this is less important (but you should still learn it) if you are buying LEAPS like HAL 1/21/2022 $22.50C).

The algos trading still can't appreciate the fact that GME halved its number of outstanding shares a while ago.

For comparison. Bestbuy is trading at almost ~0.7x of revenues with lower gross margins. Nordstrom is almost at 0.4x of revenues despite the bigger liability their department stores are having through corona (never mind their uglier balance sheet). GME is still hovering just above 0.2x revenues because stinky shorts overestimated how bad corona would be for GME (e.g. delayed console cycle, digital consoles becoming widely popular).

They want to buy some Legos and some other shit listed on the site, but GameStop can’t ship ANY of it, and the “free store pickup” is unavailable at all of the half-dozen GameStops in my region.

GameStop has major supply chain issues to fix before this is a $150-$400 stock. When you want to buy something basic from a company and they can’t supply it (or even viable alternatives) that’s a major, structural issue in the business. 

That said… if they’re generating this much online revenue with a 1-star online shopping experience, fixing the supply chain alone might be enough to turn GameStop into a powerhouse.",optimismadinfinitum,22,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lr2qkb/i_like_the_stock_pure_squeezefree_value_analysis/gok3cnw/,0.038,0.925,0.036,-0.3071

1680,BYD," <- Simpleton who has not researched any of the financials except RIDE. I just like cars.

I am long Ride. The Endurance seems like the kind of truck that middle class Americans would buy. Having a factory and low debt is a big plus. Mkt cap of $3.4B seems like reasonably priced.

Don't like NIO at all. Spent 2 months traveling all over China in spring 2019, no one in China that I talked to likes or even cares about NIO cars. Visited a showroom and sat in a test drive. It is a nice car, but NIO doesn't even have a factory. They contract with other manufactures to build their cars. ""NIO is working on solid state batteries."" Everyone except Tesla is working on SSB.

Volkswagen already has 13% market share for EV on top of being one of the biggest producers of cars worldwide with sales in the tens of millions of cars and it stands at 90 billion.   
That's totally not a bubble ^^^/s.   
And Tesla, with double the market share in EV than VW, yet only a fraction of a market share for all vehicles is valued very fairly at 700 billion.",TheChickening,14,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lr5xnl/ev_stocks_are_blood_red_time_to_buy_ev_stocks/gokvb7p/,0.0,0.844,0.156,0.9042
1707,ALB," EVs are not entirely hype...they are a winning investment as a long term hold guaranteed. Let me explain:

Every car maker has publicly declared they will make 100% clean energy(EV) vehicles by 2035. Meaning 100% of cars sold from 2035 and on will be EVs.

In 2020, EV car sales made up 1.5% of all car sales in the world. So these companies that are turning profits on EVs are doing this amongst competition in a 1.5% block of the entire automotive industry.

I agree with you that current valuations are like NKLA for most of the EV stocks out there; but there are a select few that actually have great fundamentals for being a part of an emerging industry(I will get to those tickets in a bit).

Although fundamentals are important, you can’t be boxed in with fundamentals for new industries. For example: in consumer goods industry a good P/E would be under 60x. For tech, a good P/E would be under 40x. Is AMZN a bad investment based on that fundamental ? Amazon currently has a 75x PE ratio...

Now P/E ratio is not the only fundamental, there is revenue growth, EPS growth(not always the best indicator for growth companies), Net Profit growth, etc... for growth industries however, you can not always rely on fundamentals as a base.

Back to tech, in the 1990s everything was in bubble territory(dotcom bubble happened in 2000-2002). But if you had the foresight to find those few actual profitable companies(Microsoft, Apple, etc...) you would probably not be working right now. The Tech industry in the 90s was even more risky than the EV industry now. Tech wasn’t fully adopted until around 2010s when this new bull market started taking form. My point is, tech was uncertain. The EV industry is not. There is 100% certainty that the industry is moving the EVs and there is a date of when it will be happening. So how do you pick a winner in this whole EV boom:

Look for the commodities associated with it.

EVs need to charge...charging stations will replace gas stations(not immediately but gas stations will phase out)

SBE - merging with chargepoint has 140m in revenue in 2020. They currently dominate 73% of the EV charging market.

EV batteries are made with Nickel and Lithium(I have not done enough research into these markets but here is what I know):

ALB — very profitable and consistent miner

VALE — Meme stock...so it must be good

Ultimately, the valuations will line up...however in the short term there will be some blood. But in long term investing you just need to do some research and find those gems that will be 100x baggers.

TLDR: EV industry is a guaranteed growth industry with mass adoption guaranteed. Invest in the leaders now and watch your portfolio grow 100x over the next 15 years.

There are a lot of issues with this analysis. I'll try to hit the major ones. 

For one, you're comparing two incredibly different companies - despite the Ryan Cohen connection. 

Two, company stock market values TODAY reflect investors thoughts about their FUTURE. So comparing both companies current revenue doesn't bode well for valuing their shares. For example, go check out $TSLA market cap & revenue compared to $GM. 

Three, there's a LOT more than just revenue/net income that comes into play when valuing a company. Things like... market saturation, competitive analysis, industry analysis, WACC and ROIC, ROA, use of retained earnings (reinvested leading to growth or buybacks or dividends), etc...

I think as many others have said, the comparison to Chewy is a stretch. Totally different industry and the key distinction is that GameStop sells physical games, and the industry is transitioning to digital purchases. There will never be ""digital only"" dog food.... that industry will always rely on physical goods and so Chewy was able to thrive by nailing the e-commerce opportunity in pet products. 

The gaming industry would have absolutely no reason for not eventually transitioning to 100% digital (for games at least). Ryan Cohen also found success addressing a very different demographic. Gamers vs pet owners is a VERY different group of people to market to. I don't think that just because this one guy had success in a totally different industry that addresses a totally. While I think Hedgefunds are ethically challenged and shorting stocks is ethically questionable to begin with - there is a reason GME was so heavily shorted by companies that spend billions on market research. All indications point towards GameStop being a vestigial middleman that slowly dies out. The Blockbuster of gaming, some might say.

1767,CHWY," First of all: I’m holding GME (got in @ $80), Idk the exact reality of CHWY and I cbf to dive too deep into this but as an e-commerce project manager I can say:

I assume you can’t compare these businesses with those metrics because they’re on different parts of their cycles. Chewy is in growth phase, their results shouldn’t reflect the real margins of the business because they’re likely investing heavily in marketing in order to expand customer base and eventually reach economies of scale to a point where the company will be profitable - pretty standard for any e-commerce business.

GameStop hasn’t even started doing that ... **HOWEVER** it likely wont need to throw much money at marketing because its brand awareness is off the charts and therefore customer acquisition and fidelity will be a lot cheaper. With that said, I’d say it’s more accurate to look at TAM (total addressable market) and speculate on how much market share can GME acquire AND it’d be interesting to look at the gross margins of the business(1) and EBITDA(2). Which I just did... according to their income statements for the previous years their gross margin is ~33% (whereas CHWY is ~20-25%) - take this with a grain of salt I literally calculated it off yahoo finance data.

(1) example: they sell a PlayStation for $500 - how much did it cost them?
(2) example: total logistic/real estate/personnel costs as a % of revenue

1773,CEO," [The venture capital post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0yzb5/a_venture_capital_perspective_on_gme/) with a low end target of $800 if the turnaround strategy is executed is interesting.  A probability and discount rate needs to be included to get a present value.

Personally, I think double 2019’s sales after supply issues of the new console are worked out is reasonable.  That would be $16 billion.  Reprice from a value stock to a growth stock would justify at least 1x sales.  A $16 billion market cap is $228.

GameStop isn’t much different than a SPAC.  There’s a management team that has Chewy’s CEO, two guys from Amazon to run fulfillment and tech, a the woman from Chewy for customer service.  They acquire a net debt free company with $8 billion precovid sales and have a game plan to turn around the company.  That deserves a premium.  

Anyway it is valued I see at most $30 in downside and at least $150 upside based on fundamentals.  I’m willing to take that risk.  This is all without the low float, high short interest argument.

Great attempt! = God, I can tell you tried but this is a hot mess

I'll try to hit the major ones [issues] = I seriously don't have time to list everything that is wrong, so here's a few problems that I think even you can handle (while I try not to make you feel too bad about it)

My recommendation = PLEASE DO THIS SO I DON'T FEEL PAIN READING YOUR WORK IN THE FUTURE, THIS IS LESS A RECOMMENDATION AND MORE A PLEASE LORD DO THIS

Again, great effort = maybe if I sandwich the bad between two goods they won't be as upset.. 

Keep it up = keep it up, but try to make it not suck as much next time

1778,DCF," Love this answer, however, it falls apart when used on the existing GME financial statements because they are in transition. This analysis only works on companies that are relatively focused and stable (even chewy is focused and stable compared to GME).

Tesla for example, has barely any useful historical data, yet it shoots to record highs on rumors - this is not value investing and DCF doesn't work there. There is an argument that DCF and other metrics used to value GME right now are useless because they are in transition. Either you believe the transition will be good and you should be willing to pay whatever it takes to acquire the shares on rumors alone, or you think there isn't value to be found and you watch from afar and/or short it.

TSMC is not going to stop what they're doing just to make more car chips because biden sign some executive order to review why they don't have any chips.

So basically this executive order business is meaningless. It's a token gesture for the administration to say that they're aware of the problem. They have no way of actually fixing it that doesn't take billions of dollars and 5 to 10 years.

For those who aren't familiar, when the Blue line Crosses the red line it's usually a buy indicator. More specifically it's a buy indicator if it crosses above it and both red and blue lines are above the cloud (the big grey area). (This is in the cloud, so not as strong of a buy indicator). 

In other words, the Ichimoku chart is really close to indicating a buy or sell depending on how the next few days go. My guess based on u/FluxRevived DD and other information would lead me to believe it's about to go back up.

My mindset was this, If nintendo switch does well (which has nvidia tech in it) then amd might take a hit.

It keeps swinging back and forth. I dunno if it will continue that cycle in the next 10 years, but with tech and games and all that it ONLY last for a bit before someone else takes their throne.

2108,RH," Robinhood holds all your shares in their name and on their margin. That's why their requirements shot up. You hold in your name an iuo. If they go bankrupt you're an unsecured creditor, back of the line. 

I suspect all the brokers that wouldn't allow you to buy certain stocks with settled funds in a cash account do same.

Edit: This is a normal thing with stocks purchased on margin. Problem is that RH instant is margin and your instant margin value expands to equal your non RH gold portfolio value. Aka it applies to your full account. This also begs the question, if they weren't actually buying your stocks with your money (hence their margin requirements increased by dtcc) then what the hell are they doing with your deposits?

2137,HD," I came to this conclusion when trying to decide to build my own PC versus buying the parts. On a $1000 gaming PC prebuilt, you can save $100-200 at most from building it yourself. However, then you need to factor in the operating software license and the several hours of software installations and drivers. I build refurbished PCs for my electronics recycling company and it only makes it profitable because we sell them as barebones units (no CPU, RAM, HD or anything) to companies who resell them by MARKING UP the components. The money is in selling components and costs the consumer more which is what any company who sells components of their products knows. Car companies make way more money on selling pieces per part than the whole car and the same is true for the gaming PC industry. This thread was created to talk about the value of GameStop providing a build your PC service.

2175,AAPL," Hedge funds didn’t have a portfolio consisting of 100% GME shorts and puts. They also have many large positions in high market cap companies (TSLA, AAPL, etc). If GME price rises to $5000, $10000, etc. then the hedge funds have to cover, which means selling off their long positions to raise cash. So, then you have a massive sell off in these companies too, which drives the price of those companies way down all in the same day. Those longs don’t cover all of the short positions, so some hedge funds go broke, and now the hedge funds broker has to cover, and then the market maker... etc. all of this has a domino effect, where more positions are liquidated, driving prices of stocks way lower, which triggers more sell offs from retail, hedge funds, etc. in positions wholly unrelated to GME, and the inflated price of GME eventually causes a massive wealth transfer from hundreds of legitimate companies unrelated to the GME trade into the hands of long investors in GME.  As the price rockets, all outstanding calls on GME go ITM, creating even more positions that need to be covered. Basically, you could have had GME dwarf a ton of other companies in market cap, totally unrelated to fundamentals because there was this fraud that was essentially allowed where default was inevitable if liquidity dried up (short squeeze). The only way to stop it was to halt buying momentum to get people to sell.

2178,GME, The most obvious thing is that Robinhood was lending out the GME shares of their users to shorts.

Eventually simple buys started working after an hour. I dont think it was just a collateral issue. I think the dark pools stopped participating and making a market and everything had t fall back to the exchange. Fidelity was able to provide liquidity as they actually owned 13% of the shares.

That's my point about GameStop definitely not wanting to get into that realm at all if they're smart. There's already a ton of bigger players selling laptops and prebuilts and some peripherals. Walmart, Best Buy, could undercut any price point GameStop could sell hardware for.


They do however have solid feet planted on the ground to build gaming community gathering and competitive spaces where kids without good hardware could go to play and be competitive. Opening up the PC gaming play space to those who can't spend 700+ on a PC but could justify 10 20 or even 30 dollars a month to have access to them at local GameStop would be HUGE.


Not to mention their unique position to centralize scoreboards and conditions across platforms. If they went with JUST having monthly competitions and leader boards for games across the console and PC platforms they could end up with an enormous market share of the multi billion dollar competitive gaming industry.",CiforDayZServer,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lrfnd6/frys_electronics_closing_its_doors_for_good_could/gomegey/,0.025,0.764,0.211,0.9921

2251,NC," Got a relative in the industry and I went all in today at the $ dip today- about 15k. They work for UWM, but they told me their fourth quarter loan underwrites were at an all time high. Keep in mind also that they don't just process new mortgages. They also do refinancing. So they should still have a steady revenue if the housing market somehow slows down due to covid. Which interestingly enough may not be as drastic. I am saying this based on the amount of people that have been able to transition to being able to work remotely. It explains why the real estate market is so crazy in places like Florida, Tennessee, NC, etc. People can now live where they want and are no longer anchored to their jobs. The only thing I see slowing this rocket down is if the market as a whole crashes, but thankfully Powell's statement today made things look more promising.

Also, the stock wont go below 18. So its relatively stable. This reduces some of the risks if you still want to buy in early.

IMO RDFN has the best search tool/app which drives business. It just seem like the choice out of the three (RDFN, Z/ZG, RKT).",AwwwRealMonsters,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lr35wt/rkt_dd_part_iii_but_rkt_is_just_a_mortgage_company/gojyg5d/,0.0,0.871,0.129,0.9555

2265,RKT," I like RKT as a stock but I also don't like RKT from personal experience.  Before they went public I used them three times for pre-approval.  First they are very pushy do not want you to do pre-approval anywhere else and it throws an odd vibe from the start for someone I'm sharing literally all my financial information with.  Why are they pushy and guarantee a promise land?  Because their rates have been at least 1.2% higher than my next highest bid. Closing cost 10% higher than the next highest bid.  Their algorithm for risk is much lower than your local lenders.  Again this was all before they went public I haven't attempted to use them as of late.  What I will say their process is beyond simple.  They ask straight up what they need and make it super simple to provide the documentation.  They can get you a pre-approval at light speed compared to other lenders.  With that said I'm long they're going up.

2266,RKT," Options activity suggests a gap down post earnings; retail investors won’t have enough firepower to power this stock past the shorts unfortunately. 10 year treasury rates don’t really have anywhere to go but up, which we’ve seen start to happen recently - this is horrible for RKT, as it suggests the mortgage market is set to slow down. Sure its pe is extremely low for a company that wants to be valued as a “tech” company. But what does it really have to justify it? RKT prides itself on streamlining the mortgage process, but this is something that all companies are constantly doing. You bring up the use of computer algorithms - in a world where data science has taken root in all industries (I’m a data scientist, and I can tell you that RKT’s models aren’t that complicated), again this isn’t anything new. Lastly, the key aspect of a true tech company is its scalability without incurring significant costs to acquire new customers. RKT does not have this luxury. It pays its employees to handle mortgage servicing and applications; it borrows funds to raise capital to lend out mortgages. These cannot be automated to decrease costs - check RKT’s financials to see how these costs have grown. 

Tldr; RKT isn’t the tech company that it thinks it is and cannot turn into one due to its business model; hence its current valuation is correct, and it’s not just institutions picking on it.",ConstantAd6560,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lr35wt/rkt_dd_part_iii_but_rkt_is_just_a_mortgage_company/gok1pdu/,0.046,0.906,0.048,0.1211

2271,RKT," Already the peak of refinancing is likely over so new originations are going down. With higher interest rates, you get less mortgages and refi's so even more down. What RKT has going for it, is their platform is attracting a greater percent of the market (they were at 8% in Q3 I believe). I don't know what is a feasible percent they can capture but it may be enough to offset the decline in the overall mortgage business. This is why they are priced at a higher PE then peers. People are going to be looking closely at their growth rate (as measured by % of total mortgages they originated) when they release numbers. That will probably be the catalyst for whether the stock goes up or down (assuming that can even be calculated now). Profit won't matter that much (I expect $0.91 per share, not that it matters).

2283,BMY," In a nutshell, rather than just betting that the stock will go up or down as you do with buying shares or short selling, with options you're betting how much a given stock will go up or down in a certain time frame. Take my BMY option for example. The date is 3/19 meaning it expires on that day. Strike price is 62.5 and it's a call, meaning I'm betting the price can get to at least 62.50 by 3/19. But options have intrinsic and extrinsic value; little retarded for I'm forgetting which is which, but  one is the objective value and one is the subjective value. Options give you the choice to buy (calls) or sell (puts) 100 shares of a stock at a given price on of before the expiry date. So, let's say at expiry BMY is at 70. That means the objective value of my call is 7.50, since I can buy 100 shares at 62.50 and then just immediately sell them for 70. Subjective value is different, and based on the Greeks. Best way I can explain it is that it's the potential a stock has to meet or exceed your strike price before the option expires. So, if BMY got to 70 by 3/5, the option would be worth much more than 7.50, because it still has a couple weeks to potentially go even higher.

I highly recommend looking up some YouTube videos on options basics, especially understanding what the Greeks mean",Niriro,5,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lrjc25/gain_porn_for_my_fellow_smol_account_bois_am_i/gom0flv/,0.02,0.848,0.132,0.9826

Catalyst #2 means strong earnings. Which earnings are anticipated? I mean, the cinemas were closed weren't they?

Catalyst #3: As someone related to a former cinemaowner I understand, that most of entry fee earnings are paid the production firms as a borrow fee for the movie and most of the money is made on food bought by customer. Over the last years he recognised that costumer started to take in more food than ever to avoid buying popcorn or sodas...

2369,DD," It’s not dangerous if you have solid DD and are investing in a stock because you like the company’s products, how management runs it, it’s long term goals etc. My parents invested in GE stock and got a dividend check every quarter They kept the stock for 30 years and finally sold it in retirement. If you are looking at the next stonk to rocket to the moon, then of course this is no different than gambling in a casino and it’s very dangerous behavior with a high probability of loses.",LevelOrganic1510,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lrcllf/self_sabotage_and_the_chamber_of_secrets_of_why/gomczu6/,0.048,0.855,0.097,0.573

2371,DD," Your point is what i was trying to say but i articulated it poorly. Im trying to say i will save money in the future to be able to learn to trade more. Right now im still trading, and tracking my moves. And reading constant market sentiment and studying other peoples trades. I do not use WSB as a guide. I use it for humor and the occasional DD. But mostly humor. My point, saving extra money i make for strictly trading.
