I found out about WSB when my AMC went from $3 to $20 and I was able to recoup my losses (bought at $5) and I stumbled onto the reason why it jumped. 

I’m not the kinda guy to risk big money, so I never really appreciated the “yolo diamond hand ape rocket autistic cuckold” mentality, but it sent me down a rabbit hole to find subs like these and I’m glad I did.

72,RH," Because the stock has a Nasdaq deficiency notice, the company has to get the share price back into compliance of +$1 for 10 business days otherwise they may be delisted. If a company cannot regain compliance through increased hype or news or some other means, they generally do a reverse split to avoid delisting. Not all companies do this though, and companies that are delisted from the Nasdaq are no longer supported on RH. You can sell the position only at that point. Other brokers do allow for OTC stocks, but OTC stocks are generally deemed more risky. 

The general concensus that this is primed is because the company is motivated to regain compliance, so news or other good press may become more frequent over the next few weeks.

8. Check the following **pipeline** and its lead candidates:

[https://www.tymeinc.com/our-science/pipeline/default.aspx](https://www.tymeinc.com/our-science/pipeline/default.aspx)

Our first-in-class Cancer Metabolism-Based Therapies (CMBTs™) compounds include SM-88 and TYME-18. These compounds are structurally and mechanistically different, but each offers the potential for better and safer medicines. Early clinical results demonstrated by SM-88 in multiple advanced cancers, including pancreatic, prostate, sarcomas and breast, reinforce the potential of our emerging CMBT pipeline. Moreover, we believe this pipeline offers hope to patients for a new future in long-term management of advanced cancers, as well as commercial promise for TYME.

Our lead clinical CMBT compound, SM-88, is an oral investigational modified proprietary tyrosine derivative that is hypothesized to **interrupt the metabolic processes of cancer cells by breaking down the cells’ key defenses and leading to cell death through oxidative stress and exposure to the body’s natural immune system. To date, clinical trial data have shown that SM-88 has achieved confirmed tumor responses across 15 different cancers, both solid and liquid tumors, including pancreatic, lung, breast, prostate, sarcoma and lymphoma cancers with minimal serious Grade 3 or higher adverse** events, which we believe is rare for investigational compounds. Our lead compound SM-88 is now in a pivotal trial and an adaptive randomized Phase II/III clinical trial with registration intent for patients with second- and third-line pancreatic cancer. Patients are also being enrolled in a Phase II study evaluating SM-88 in high-risk sarcomas, and we presented final SM-88 Phase II clinical data at European Society for Medical Oncology’s ESMO 2019 conference showing encouraging clinical benefit in patients with bio-marker recurrent prostate cancer.

We are making noteworthy progress across multiple areas of drug development. The major objective of our clinical-trial programs is to broaden our knowledge of the full potential of SM-88, and to evaluate and advance the promising potential of other innovative, proprietary new CMBT compounds. Our clinical-trial programs produced impressive results in fiscal 2020. Data from these studies were highlighted at multiple major international medical meetings by clinical investigators representing leading cancer research centers of excellence.

TYME recently announced a potential new approach to treating COVID-19 using a metabolic agent, TYME-19. TYME-19 is a synthetic bile acid, a family of metabolic agents that the Company also uses in its anticancer product, TYME-18. Because of its expertise in metabolic therapies, **the Company was able to quickly identify TYME-19 as a potent, well characterized antiviral bile acid and has performed preclinical experiments establishing effectiveness against COVID-19**. Bile acids have primarily been used for liver disease; however, they represent a family of critical cellular regulators across cardiovascular, neurologic, and metabolic systems, with some also having antiviral properties.

TYME has partnered with physicians from Massachusetts General Hospital and the Weill Cornell Medical Center to design a trial for recently diagnosed, symptomatic patients. The proof-of-concept trial is expected to start as soon as customary trial site approvals are completed.

**TYME has an expanding patent portfolio broadly covering compositions, methods, manufacturing and use of its pipeline to 2032, and beyond. To date, TYME has 194 issued patents and patent applications worldwide, including 10 issued patents and an additional 12 patent applications in the United States.** We will continue to make appropriate investments in our CMBT pipeline that have the potential to yield clinical results of the kind presented throughout fiscal 2020. We are encouraged by what we accomplished and are very excited about the opportunities that lie ahead.",BuylowBuylow,7,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/lebj7a/daily_discussion_thread/gmha0v7/,0.071,0.807,0.122,0.9871

It has issued new shares recentlly but will benefit in long term by raising capital to increase profit, this how mREIT grow and this also provide the best time to buy this mREIT at the dip with great discount price. Buying dip is the best way to win big in REIT because you enjoy the yield and also the appreciation. 

$IVR is a great deal because profit is increasing and the dividend has raised 60% from $0.05 to $0.08 on Dec 2020 (follow the cash never go wrong).

I ended up averaging down for like 6 weeks until I had 50,000 shares at .26 (started buying at .55 I believe) ended up holding for two or three months with it only seeming to go down more each week finally sold for my biggest loss ever.

261,CCIV," Only issue I have with CCIV is there is no DA or LOI so it's  all just rumors for now.  If it doesn't happen, CCIV will quickly crash back down.

Just looked up Butterfly Networks and I'm definitely dropping $1k on that one tomorrow.  Definitely a takeover target for a larger medical provider in the future once their deliveries start to take off.

Also check out MGNI for CTV ads.  Larger player is TTD which I missed, smaller players are KBNT, FLNT, and PERI.  All had a sympathy run up on Friday with the news from MGNI with an acquisition.

291,ATOS," What has been your biggest gain?

Not stock: dogecoin - about a grand at ~0.023 per coin and holding.

Stock:
ATOS ($82 gain right now, still holding) and IDEX $37, still holding). Both had higher returns prior to Friday.

How much did you initially put in?
About $200-$250 per each of those stocks. 

How much research did you do on it?
Initially: about an hour’s worth before jumping in. Continue to do research and learn more about each industry.

What was your best resource for research? Google, Marketwatch, Reddit subs on how to invest (among others), and of course each company’s respective website. 

I think knowing the company is just as important as knowing the trends of the industry is just as important. 

What have you learned since then?

I think both ATOS and IDEX show promise. ATOS for their compelling research returns on breast cancer treatment and COVID-19 therapeutic, and IDEX for the wave of green tech/economy disrupters.
