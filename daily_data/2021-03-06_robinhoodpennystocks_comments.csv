55,ARDS," [CTXR](https://i.imgur.com/N7MJUr3.jpg)

I'm looking to get to 1000 shares before April. At 480 currently. Have really strong faith long-term in these guys. They announced that they're working on a treatment for covid-related respiratory issues that I guess stemmed from their ARDS treatment.

Their ARDS treatment will enter FDA trials next year. ARDS is acute respiratory distress syndrome and can be caused by sepsis or moderate to severe smoke inhalation, like we see with people pulled from fires. There is no FDA approved treatment for ARDS currently. If approved, they will be the first and only.

This year we'll see the MinoLok phase 3 results, which sound like they'll be amazing. We'll get information on how well their hemorrhoid treatment looks. If their hemorrhoid treatment gets FDA approval, they'll be the first and only prescription hemorrhoid treatment in the US. That would likely happen next year I think but we'll definitely get some insight into it this year. And this year we'll get some info about their MinoWrap, the product that helps with infections stemming from post-mastectomy breast reconstructions.

I have no idea where this stock will be at the end of the year but this is one I'm looking to hold for the next 5+ years at least. This has a lot of potential and if MinoLok is a huge success for them, it's going to be very interesting seeing what other products they can come up with.",ict_brian,4,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/lys8z7/still_holding_ctxr_pc_on_the_9th_with_pipeline/gpuws5f/,0.028,0.823,0.149,0.9817

62,SOS," I unfortunately am chained to this ship lol

But luckily the firm seems like  ""stock"" ambulance chasers--- They're the ones trying to sue DFV, and stir the waters on any stock with any question marks. SOS is one of many companies that they are calling out this week.

63,DD," good for you, its all downhill from here....

Belmont, HB, and Culper have all contacted the SEC, forwarded the info to them and are currently communicating. The ships sinking.
