5,PT," I sold when it hit 2.40 the first time and have bought and sold a few times since. The market seems a lot more turbulent  right now so an accurate PT is tough and you'll need to decide yourself. Things to keep in mind.

1. Those official price targets are factoring in the approval at the end of the year, so some institutions might view a $4 price as high at this time. 

2. This is a penny stock with no means of generating profit for the rest of the year and even some of next year.(once its approved at the end of year it still needs to produce and sell these things). So even though the recent Direct Offering gave them plenty of cash, they will probably be getting plenty of offers for another offering over the next months and they might be tempted.",samchih,5,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/n4cc69/selling_ctxr/gwuyv4p/,0.025,0.915,0.06,0.7269

17,ZOM," I'd hold on to ZOM. Sales from their Truforma product should add some value to the company. Consider it a mid to long term investment. 

As for your loss, you'll only take a loss if you sell. You own those shares. Granted that phrase doesn't work for everything, but it's something to remember. I can't count how many times I've sold something I was down on, only to watch it climb back up x-amount of months later.

But seriously, consider this a lesson. If a stock has had a huge run up and you feel like you're getting FOMO, don't buy it. ESPECIALLY a penny stock. Even with blue chip stocks there's almost always a pull back after a big jump. Everyone wants to make money quick. See green every time they open their app. Some people are great at it.

19,ZOM," to break even you need to get to 2.09. If you doubled your shares you would need to get to 1.53 to break even. It's still a risk. I did that with NKED and a few other reddit stocks. A couple I just took the loss. 

   You sell at $1.00 you lose $300. If you can make that $300 back up in other stocks before ZOM breaks even. Then you can sell. If it takes 6 months for ZOM to get back to $2.09.

20,UK, Ocugen has rights to sell in the USA and take 45%. That's it afaik despite claiming they're helping develop the vaccine. They'll probably need to run a new clinical trial in the United States and get a good efficacy and safety result to get an EUA. That's why there was no EUA for AstraZeneca based on UK/Brazil data and why there's no EUA for Novavax based on UK data. The window of time to ethically start a placebo controlled trial for adults in the United States has closed... instead you need a non-inferiority trial against other vaccines in an environment where cases are falling. The path to an EUA in the USA for Ocugen/COVAXIN is very long and I think will almost certainly be closed before the landscape changes to something like combined vaccines for sars-cov-2 and influenza in 2022/2023.,coliguy,3,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/n4foua/new_vaccine_possibilities/gww8caj/,0.053,0.84,0.107,0.8409

47,TTM," When I started I read investopedia.com until I got massive headaches. It's great to understand concepts. 

I open tabs for finviz, NASDAQ, Whale Wisdom, open insider, trading view, the stock company's website, yahoo finance, Fintel, Seeking Alpha. I look at the companies financials on quarterly, annually, and TTM basis. I use trading view for charts, and compare the spikes and drops to news items listed on finviz. I review the company's leadership, industry moats and competitors and try to translate what they do into layman's terms. If I don't know or understand what a company does, I'm not investing. 

I have a degree in journalism, I'm used to asking who, what, where, when, why and how. I compare the company's historical price and try to build a narrative to where it is now. 

I used to search Twitter for what people were saying about stocks, but it's just as bad as stocktwits, which is absolute dogshit.

Absolute best experience? Probably trading and learning by trial and error. Develop a personal strategy beyond ""buy low sell high"".
