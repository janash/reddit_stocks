4,DD, you need to do ur own DD and homework don’t ever invest a $1 into a stock just because someone says to you can take advice and knowledge but don’t just invest into something because the next man is. but personally $nio is a very good stock to buy rn. there a electric car company that last year was at $2.17 and shot up to $60 in a year and now it dipped into the low 40s which is a great buy. it will be a few hundred dollar stock in a few years i believe wholeheartedly in $NIO 📈📈🚀🚀,TheMarketIsMyOnlyWay,1,/r/RobinHood/comments/ma5eaj/i_have_1k_to_spare_need_avice/grqllqz/,0.026,0.875,0.099,0.8515
