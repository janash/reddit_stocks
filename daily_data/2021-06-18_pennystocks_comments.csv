13,PFS," Let's do some math...

First the assumptions:

* The [current spot price](https://www.lme.com/Metals/Minor-metals/Lithium-prices) of LiOH is $15,000/t so we'll assume that's the price EMH gets for their lithium
* EMH's [PFS indicates](https://www.europeanmet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Powering-sustainable-European-e-mobility.pdf) it will cost EMH $3,435/t to produce LiOH after tin credits.
* EMH's [PFS indicates](https://www.europeanmet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Powering-sustainable-European-e-mobility.pdf) they will produce 25,267 tpa
* CEZ (EMH's JV partner) takes half of the LiOH produced

Profit per ton = $15,000 - $3,435 = $11,565

Profit per year = 25,267 \* $11,565 = $292.2M

EMH's cut = $292.2M / 2 = $146.1M

If you give EMH a 10x P/E ratio that would mean a **$1.46B market cap**.

Keep in mind that EMH/CEZ are talking about doubling the tpa from the PFS by running a night shift on the mine.  And, the production cost calculation was made when tin was selling at a much lower price, so the production costs today would be lower.",SourerDiesel,5,/r/pennystocks/comments/o2mfhi/european_metals_holdings_erpnf_largest_hardrock/h28mcbg/,0.046,0.895,0.059,0.4215

This year BLM has nowhere near the same exposure or movement like itâ€™s did last year in June. Last year in June saw the highest amount of business and donations to black owned businesses and charities. This did not happen this year.

92,AB," Both, thereâ€™s a unknown offer from Uppgard Konsult AB in Germany, where they were tasked by a undisclosed buyer to buy 200 million shares, in 1 million increments at a share price of $.58 usd, by June 30th 2021. Because they are basically buying half the companies shares, itâ€™s looked at as a possible hostile takeover. Link to article on the offer: https://www.google.com/amp/s/finance.yahoo.com/amphtml/news/uppgard-konsult-ab-announces-share-133000760.html

The price will skyrocket if this offer/takeover goes through. The other catalysts is just the companyâ€™s progress in producing oil and sand, which has just started to be produced and commercially sold as of last Friday.

If no takeover, and with the cost of oil predicted to reach $100 soon, theyâ€™re looking at $1+ in the next year once they start getting closer to their goal of producing 5000 bbls per day. Short term itâ€™s a good gamble, long term itâ€™s an amazing gamble. Just look into Canadaâ€™s problem with trying to go Green with their oil sands by 2025, they need this tech.
