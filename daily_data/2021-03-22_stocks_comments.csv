0,AMZN," Interesting post. A friend was lamenting the other day that he didn't buy AMZN at 20 way back in the day. I asked him if he thought he would have held it all the way to 3000 if he had.

We both agreed that we probably would have sold at around 100. If not then, than definitely at 300-500. 

Holding a profitable stock long term really is incredibly difficult. You have to have an almost fanatical belief in the company.",Furloughedinvester,1036,/r/stocks/comments/mafmmw/apple_holder_for_15_years_now_heres_why_it_wasnt/grsdlw2/,0.093,0.785,0.122,0.3788

5,ONE," You can't compare Tesla's run to Apple.  In the last 15 years; Apple has never 7 or 8x in ONE year.  I'm not even sure Apple has made over 100% in a one year period;  someone can check that.   Apple moved slowly and surely through the years while Tesla rocketed 700% in one year.

When Apple was 650B, equal to what Tesla is right now; they were extremely profitable not barely like Tesla.  Also, it was around this time they started paying the dividend and Berkshire went in.  They were already making in excess of 10B in net income per year and didn't have to relay on EV credits to become profitable.",dr3amboy3657,128,/r/stocks/comments/mafmmw/apple_holder_for_15_years_now_heres_why_it_wasnt/grsj8rf/,0.032,0.869,0.099,0.8373

10,IMO," Peloton, IMO is a stupid bet - they aren't unique in any way and that is why, they are catering to a small market who is rich and will be irrelevant within a couple of years because there is nothing proprietary to what they sell. 

They didn't create anything unique.... the software isn't unique, literally - nothing is unique. When you look at Tesla, Netflix and Apple - they are game changers. Peloton doesn't embody that.

After diving into this post and the comments - it seems this is heavily based on luck and people who didn't know what they were doing or didn't put in the research to see what was coming. We live in a data / information driven age now and we are able to see trends and where money is going to be pushed / circulating.

20,DVD," Agreed.  New investors don't get this.

I think looking at ones stocks to much can be partly the issue.  Makes person act emotionally -- which surprising most investors are.

Not that is should make a difference, but dollar amount and not a percentage also makes people more jumpy.  Example:  5% of 1,000.  vs. a 5% move on 1,000,000 :)  Logical it should not make difference to a person, but physiologically it a whole different story.

News and sentiment drives people choices.  I also think the large fish purposely love to generate volatility and for that exact reason.   They feed of the small ""insecure"" fish, people think stop losses are ""good"", when in realty those can murder you if set them to tightly.  I tend to not use them.  Netflix when they dropped heavily when they wanted to rename and spin off DVD way back, that crap was nuts ... wild & ""suspicious"" ride that was.  But its a good example of the physiological ride, the correct thing would have been to add 2/3 on the way down, then another 1/3 where one guess the bottom was.  But the realty was the brave held  for dear life (not daring to buy a single addition point), and the majority just dumped out of panic and never bough back.   Then after it rocked the ""brave"" that had held and never added when seeing 40% profit sold their positions (after that ride, 40% looks pretty great) .. and only the very, very rare trader help and did the 2/3, 1/3 adding to their positions ... and again the hedgies make their millions/billion and murder the small fish.  It has been this way since black Friday.  Nothing new.

So yea, to hold a stock it really ... really hard IMO and not as easy as people think.  They look at chart history and think it was an ""easy"" ride ... when it never is.

I favor larger cap companies with good track records, but even large companies can go belly up ... and I think infinitely holding a stock can be dangerous too.  The good think about large can is they much harder for hedgies to generate artificial volatility.

At the end of the day, investing is a physiological game mostly with yourself IMO ... with no easy answers.

I have been trading on and off since before .com crash, 9/11 ... that crap was nuts.  Then came house market crash and the more resent Armageddon ""we all gonna die"" of covid crap.  Even Buffet made a statement that ""now he had seen it all"", yet that man had allot of cash on hand when it happened and they added allot of positions after the tanking.

For Tesla, yes they are investing for the future but they don't actually have the ability to turn that profit spigot on.

Third, Tesla’s P/E is really 308 when you adjust earnings for stock based compensation (which is not a real cash expense). 

Also, Tesla is growing much faster than Amazon ever was. Tesla’s 5 year revenue CAGR is 50% and they guided for it to continue to grow at an average 50% with some years faster and some slower due to lumpiness of production ramps.

82,BYD," They've got 3X the market share of Tesla in Europe already. I think they'll sell plenty of 370HP AWD self-driving capable 400mi range VW busses for under $50k starting in a year. That's a far better package than the model Y. Taycan was last generation battery tech and is still a far better performance EV than anything Tesla has made on a track. 

They also don't get flunking grades for quality control & panel gaps, and the drivetrains don't get nerfed after 3 minutes power due to heat sink issues. 

They're an absolute bargain with a market cap under 200B for the likely eventual winner and current #1/2 current auto company in the world, shares only dropped down to these low levels because of dieselgate, and that's well in the rear view mirror. 

Tesla's bull case always required them becoming the absolute king of market share. They moved too slow, and that's why VW is surging this year... They're eating Tesla alive in Europe and coming to the States in-full next year.

I think as the market leader, market share is critical. It shows preservation of momentum and shows ability to compete, which is a bit different than capturing the early adopters.   


Agreed on materials -- I'm in the research and buying phase for REM mining companies and lithium producers these days, as there will be massive profits there and there is little REM production outside of China - that's the bottleneck coming after we get through the current chip shortage. Speaking of -- potentially big opportunity for Tesla there, as they shouldn't run into that shortage having control of more of their supply chain.  


I'm not a huge fan of the current ID.3 and coming ID.4 and have been a bit surprised at how well they're selling. The one I have my eye on is the ID Buzz (Bus), which they're projecting at 370HP and 5.2s quarter mile with the AWD (which matches up with the weights). The interior looks incredibly designed, and it'll be a perfect baby-mobile for my wife and I as we have a little one on the way. Otherwise I agree that Tesla makes the best all-around vehicles in terms of overall capabilities, I just don't know that making the best-of-all-worlds is always making the best actual vehicle. A model S P90D is as fast as a Taycan in a quarter-mile, gets an extra 100+ miles of range, and pulls about the same skidpad and braking numbers, but it can't stand repeated track abuse like the Taycan - which leaves a niche that Porsche met with that. The model Y might be a better ""all around vehicle"" than even the Buzz I want to get, but the Buzz will fit my lifestyle much better.

98,ID," I think we're mostly on the same wavelength then.   
My only gripe is that market share gives a skewed vision. VW has indicated a much slower production growth than Tesla heading into 2025. If those numbers are to be believed Tesla should by all accounts be ahead or at least equal to VW in EU.  And that's something that market share, without any comments, doesn't take into account.  
Tesla's ability to scale with Giga Berlin and Giga Austin should be interesting to see.

Fully agree on the lifestyle aspect. I like Tesla as a company but I would not buy a Tesla or any EV today as I wouldn't even be able to properly charge it, which is why I'm also big on charging stations.

There will always be a performance car doing it better, or a compact car with more milage - but I do believe that few are offering the Tesla package at the same price for at least some years.

Based on VWs aggressive timeline of going all EV in five years, this tells us is that they are making a lot more batteries than they'll know what to deal with.  It's a good problem to have and could allow them to spin-off and pivot a tier-one supplier company.

I think efficiency will hopefully drive the entire sector forward.  Instead of dealing with ICE cars that get anywhere from 250 to 400 miles per tank, we ultimately start seeing EV getting 600 miles per charge.

It also remains to be seen how their used values hold up.  People are keeping their vehicles longer and longer every year -- average age of a car on the road in the US is somewhere around 11 years.  Considering that we don't really have many data points that are fully modeled by the existing market and ""seasoning"", and replacement of the batteries will cost around the price of a brand-new compact car (USD$15,000) it remains to be seen how this affects the demand of new vehicle sales.",SextonKilfoil,1,/r/stocks/comments/masoi4/is_it_time_to_sell_tesla_my_thoughts_on_cathie/gruicr0/,0.01,0.937,0.053,0.7351

153,GM," That's kind of my point.  Tesla, barring some huge unforeseen calamity that affects every other manufacturer, won't sell 20MM/year by 2030.  They will have the *capacity* to do so, absolutely, but their batteries will be in the chassis of other manufacturers.  And *that* is where they will make their money in the future.  Attempting to capture 20% of the global new car market is a pipe dream that every OEM plans for but in reality, no ever actually hits.

At this point, it's really about what is a reasonable projection.  While they are growing YoY, that's mostly due to the small volumes they produce today.  GM, Toyota, VWAG pump out ~9MM units a year and Tesla struggles to crack an order of magnitude *less* than that.  They'll likely settle just above the ranks of ""luxury"" makes like BMW, Mercedes, and Lexus; around 4MM units.

155,ICE," You're making my case.

ICE OEM's don't have assets in those production lines. They're liabilities at this point. Tesla beats many of them in automotive margin. If they're willing to lower their margin and pass on savings to their customers they can. How much money do all the other major OEMs make on each of their competing cars? Doesn't Ford make the MachE in Mexico else lose a huge amount on each unit sold?

Who cares about efficiency? Did you never look at MPG when buying a car? Except it's so much more than that. If for example, Tesla can go 400 miles on 100kwh - that's a selling point. Someone else may want to go 400 miles but they have to install 110-130kwh. Now you've got a heavier car. You've also got a much more expensive car since no one else is close to Tesla's kwh/$$$. VW and others may be there in 2-3 years. But by that time Tesla will have cut their own prices by another 40-60%.

229,CVS," $DG DOLLAR GENERAL
     With the advent of DoorDash deliveries, and the limited selection of cheap goods in rural areas, Dollar general is exploding in growth and opening tons of stores. Dollar general will be the prime target for DoorDash to utilize for home essentials on the platform. I'm speaking from experience, I'm a doordasher, And I can tell you I would much rather go shopping for somebody at Dollar general versus Walmart or CVS.
   If you live in the boonies, You're only options for the essentials are gas stations, pharmacies, or Dollar general. Dollar general happens to have much better prices than the other two options. This creates a path of least resistance for  customers. The store is also very smart with picking a good variety of items to stock in the store, making much better use of the space than other stores, such as ALDI.
   I have noticed a lot more of the storage opening up in my own home city, And from people I talk to who live in other towns it is going on the same way. Dollar general is one of the few places I don't mind shopping.

$DBX DROPBOX
       Remote work will continue to evolve, The need for digital workspaces is growing. The need to send and verify secure documents is also a growing demand. Many companies Will alter and become office free environments soon.
         All of our videos, pictures, music, art, creations, are all stored on the cloud. Every year that data that we store gets bigger and bigger and we have more files added to it every year. Currently, the big tech companies are subsidizing the pricing for cloud storage and offering it to us consumers for free. This will not always be the case though, and once they stop subsidizing the cost of cloud, it won't be a charity anymore. Dropbox holds a sizeable portion of the market of cloud, And as more people use more space, The idea of paying for cloud every month is going to be more ubiquitous amongst consumers.
     They also have a stellar balance sheet, completely undervalued for a SAAS company, and have been a  sticky service for over a decade with some of the biggest names for competition. They built out their own servers and do not rely on Amazon AWS like 99% of other companies online. Could also be a great acquisition Target, But they will make better gains for investors as a solo company.

I think PENN hitting the S&P is gonna skyrocket it (assuming we dont have another crazy sell off day with high yield rates... thoughts draftkings has been up during those days before too). Im debating if its even worth jumping into monday. It should historically have a huge profit sell off after this week or next. Most newly listed sky rocket before stabilizing. 52 week high is $140... currently at $118 (after a red day). Id definitely look to buy under $120. But if buy the rumors sell the news holds true... tomorrow very well could be a huge sell off too. Be interesting to watch.

482,MO," Completely agree. When pot gets federal legalization, imo youre basically gonna have four groups fighting for market share. Black/grey market fighting for relevance, Canadian companies, local US companies in legal states, and big Tobacco. 


Black/grey market is gonna be forced to pull all kinds of moves to stay relevant. Im in Canada, and from what Ive seen they typically have cheaper concentrates, sell edibles stronger than the legal limit, sell weed to those under 21 (in quebec) and sell cheaper weed of higher quality. Legal weed is starting to catch up in terms of pricing and I have no doubt that eventually grey market weed is gonna get phased out. But those first couple of years where grey market weed keeps some market share is gonna be killer for smaller US producers. Seeing how conservative the US is, I have almost no doubt that in the event of federal legalization, theres gonna be a bunch of caveats. No concentrates, 21 age limit, no edibles, shit packaging etc. Bigger companies can ride this period out of greater competition much better than small US producers. 

Canadian companies are a bit of a wild card. I have no clue how the US is going to handle foreign weed imports. Im staying off for a bit. 

Smaller weed producers tend to have thin margins, and no backup. Theres also been a big issue of glut. Everytime a state legalizes weed, there ends up being more producer's and dispensaries than needed; imo only a few local players will be able to survive the culling. Not to mention the aforementioned black market competition. 


Large producers like MO are gonna end up dominating the cannabis industry. Its not like tobacco is going anywhere, so theyll have some sort of income to rely on during those turbulent few years. Seeing MO lobby for legalization has made me extremely bullish on them.",PM_ME_CATS_420,3,/r/stocks/comments/majdif/rstocks_daily_discussion_monday_mar_22_2021/grt84oi/,0.107,0.81,0.083,-0.9023

571,GME," With the upcoming earnings report on Tuesday, it’s safe to say that this week will be absolutely bananas for **GME**. So let’s look at some alternative data points on the most talked about stock right now.

&#x200B;

* First things first, GME is the most mentioned stock on Reddit and it’s not even close. Since January, GME has been mentioned an average of 10.000+ times per day on Reddit.
* Gamestop is also among the most mentioned stocks on the popular forum StockTwits with around 11.000+ mentions per day. Sentiment is high, 81% of all mentions are bullish.
* Gamestop gets around 1,000 new followers per day on Instagram. That is an impressive number, especially compared to their competitors.
* All mentions on social media have probably been one driving factor to the increase of website visitors. [Gamestop.com](http://gamestop.com/) attracted around 53 million visitors in February, up 30% since October last year.
* Gamestop’s mobile apps (where users can get personalized gaming news and buy games) are downloaded 250k times per month, up from around 210k a month ago. Decent growth. And users like the apps, the average review is 4.5 stars out of 5.
* Around 42k people are working for Gamestop and the company currently has 6,282 open job positions. This is a high number but it’s actually down from 6,672 in December and the number of total employees is also down by 3k in the last year. A growing company should have an increase in open positions month over month (if it’s not restructuring or pivoting) so this is a little bit of a red flag.
* The average employee review is pretty low (3.2 stars out of 5) and employees are complaining about Management and limited Career Opportunities.

Will the price be higher now or then? I'd predict the price will be higher during the actual recovery.

As to why the price will go up, Nike is a cyclical stock, and people will buy more Nike products when the economy is good because it's a luxury brand. As far as COVID reasons, my thought is once we, hopefully, start recovering from this, people will buy more exercise apparel as they are allowed to return to indoor gyms.

Another big event I think of is arenas and stadiums allowing people to attend sports events again. Sports is a social event, and once people are able to attend games again and watch with friends, they'll start buying more team jerseys, shirts, and other apparel. Nike in particular might see a boost in this field because they provide the official uniforms to the big 3 sports, the: NBA, NFL, and MLB.

All that being said, if you pick the right tech stocks, I think they will for sure do much better long-term than Nike, but I also think NKE's price will be going up during the recovery and might be a good diversification play if you're looking for other areas to invest in than tech.

Edit: While I like Nike, if you're looking for an even better non-tech stock to hold long-term, I'd invest in Disney.",HappyCrabDay,2,/r/stocks/comments/maq5de/thoughts_on_nke/gru70rp/,0.0,0.879,0.121,0.9893

Interesting suggestion

the more I look at it the more I'm convinced

Still a little unsure with how much debt they took on in 2020 & implications for paying off this debt. But looks like they have some good backers.

A little confused how their assets increased so much without corresponding increase in liability/generating profits. Perhaps there's some IP in there which is promising.

Definitely worth a look - I might leave it on the backburner to see if they're able to make use of the new assets they've acquired and can convert this into revenue",UEAMatt,1,/r/stocks/comments/maq0yc/lumen_hidden_value_and_a_7pct_dividend_while_one/grugh0j/,0.104,0.647,0.25,0.9403

One more suggestion I could offer; don't open an account at Vanguard.  Every brokerage is commission free.  Open your account that gives you a promotion cash bonus like E\*Trade for example.

Other things I could suggest are writing OTM covered calls on VOO when it hits a new ATH for a little more income.  Also, if this savings also represents your emergency fund then consider opening a margin account and investing all or nearly all of it in VOO.  You can borrow from margin for short term emergencies and only pay interest on borrowed funds.

613,DD," I'd suggest that you need to do a bit more DD. There is more to oil than Texas.

The Texas grid doesn't use any significant amount of oil for power. Their thermal plants running coal and gas were not (and are not) prepared for freezing temps and their wind farms are not prepared for ice because the equipment for that costs money, and that's why they lost generation. This lack of preparedness for ""occasional"" cold snaps has burned them periodically for years. They have plenty of natural gas and wind - what they are missing is the motivation to actually harden their systems for cold events that are nothing-burger for the same systems in colder climates. It had nothing to do with the availability of oil or any other fuel.

The US and world market (and OPEC, a cartel) set the price of oil, and oil demand is driven mostly by transportation and shipping. It doesn't matter if Rick Perry or Greta Thunberg is the governor of Texas; state politics means nothing in that market. 

US producers are in a pickle. Demand is down and OPEC is controlling price with production limits. If US producers start ramping up supply they will drive the price back down. OPEC can and will flood the market and drive the price down to a point where US producers can't compete.",Mysterious-Gas-1973,3,/r/stocks/comments/ma6bj4/re_energy_oil_sector_consider_mro_marathon_oil/grqujtd/,0.06,0.903,0.038,-0.2883

I've made more money on MRO, faster, than ANY stock in my portfolio since a month before i joined Reddit. (Im a new poster here though I have lurked on Reddit FOREVER. Do not own GME or AMC) I think OXY doesnt have the retail MOJO Marathon Oil has. I also  think you are one smart/savvy investor. However, most people arent like you. They don't think. They emote and react viscerally. There's something about Marathon/MRO that sparks the spirit of many Americans. And Texans. Old cowboys, cowgirls and greenhorns alike are now investing in this stock. Im riding their enthusiasm and it's a blast. And marketing-wise, think about it. Fundamentals didnt move GME and AMC;  retail investors did. Look what happened when the word got out about those companies which are NOT worth their stock price?  However,  I found MRO on Wall Street Bets and then saw some hype about them on Robinhood. That got my curiosity up real early. As for DD, lets say that's what I do for my day job Investigate. Backgrountd, asett checks, looking for shell companies, hunting liars, cheats, thieves and monsters. So trust me on this, I have done my DD on MRO.  And the key people who run  it.  Now I'm just settin' here on my day off, looking forward to sunset; another sunrise; and another MRO uptick. And should she go red, I'll be buying more. I do  think you are in a great place with OXY.

642,GDP," That’s what Ray Dalio said. Jeremy Grantham said similar thing, but he is expecting market crash, but emerging market seems better investment option. 
Japan, EU printed more money than US per GDP capita. At the end, everyone printed so much money and expecting inflation. 
However, idk if u watched Scott Minerd ( guggenheim ) interview. He is saying no crazy inflation like others expecting, and he is expecting negative fed rate. M2, the money circulation is low bc people are not spending much as we expected. People are saving their money and not spending as what fed actually anticipated.
I always listen to multiple asset managers who play with billions of dollars, and everyone has different point of view on economy.

Also, what kind of stocks would you buy? Growth stocks seems risky with fear of inflation, value stocks seems the right choice recently, and what if the fed start ‘operation twist’ you will miss the big upside of growth.

If everyone is expecting inflation, commodity price should go to the moon, but it’s not. Some argue that the oil price went up. I think it went up because of the Biden admin stopped allowing new drilling on fed land. Less supply, same demand or slightly increased demand.

At the end, it’s what you believe and how comfortable you are to invest your hard earned money.

654,TDOC," This is a nothing burger. I don't think people realize the stickiness of telehealth services and HIPAA compliance issues. Not to mention how long it takes to integrate partnerships with major health insurance providers. TDOC is international at this point. 

Amazon is known for throwing things at the wall to see if it sticks. It's a strategy that's worked for them, however they've had their share of failures along the way (fire phone). Telehealth is vastly different than any other service they've provided in the past. If anything I think it's going to be a superficial/add on service that's paired with refills and little else. 

I've been investing in TDOC before the pandemic and the Livongo merger was a huge catalyst for adding to my position. Didn't even know ARK was buying TDOC if I'm being completely honest. 

They're currently caught on the wrong side of the rotation out of stay at home stocks. Fact is they've been growing prior to covid and will continue to grow even faster now. When you couple convenience and savings you get a high net promoter score and a value proposition most patients will come back for again and again. 

My wife is a telehealth nurse practitioner (not TDOC) so I've had my share of insight into the importance of data, integration of systems, partnerships, necessary growing pains, compliance and regulatory hurdles etc.  It's not as easy as solving logistics problems and while Amazon has the capital, I personally think this will be a few years in the making and slower than they anticipate. 

Important to note TDOC tapped less than 1% of the TAM thus far. The fact that Amazon is trying to capture a significant portion of TAM tells you it's a huge opportunity for many players. End of the day this is an acknowledgement and a nod to the viability of telehealth. 

TDOC is on a fire sale and I'm maxed out for what I've allocated of my portfolio. Watch what happens over the coming few years, you'll be kicking yourself for not having a piece. Obviously don't invest if you don't have conviction but I highly encourage anyone interested to jump down the rabbit hole.",anthonyjh21,3,/r/stocks/comments/mad2b4/amzn_vs_tdoc_telehealth_disruption/grsc85q/,0.03,0.877,0.093,0.9435

704,SQ," To answer ur question it's risky. 

Etfs do Diversify and that does reduce risk sure. But an ETF like arkf is specifically centered around one industry. What happens when that industry becomes non favored by the market ? Other industries will be favored instead and now ur under on ur investment until the market changes it's fine. 

Most of arkfs holdings seem to be in tech with a hint of blockchain? So what happens if by the time u need this money the fed decides to hike up interest rates which causes tech to drop and the market to veer towards other industries outside of tech? 

I like what ark does , and for what it's worth I hold a good amount of SQ, but it is not a good one etf portfolio. It's a great product to include in ur overall portfolio but it's risky by itself if u have a short time horizon. If u want to be invested in the market tracking the S&P 500 is probably a lot safer if u need the money in a few years.

Edit: found this on yahoo finance forums-
“Somebody recently mentioned there is a discrepancy on P/E reporting on different sites. My advice - do not trust anybody, calculate your own number. I always use a trailing P/E based on the company reported GAAP earnings. I use my own records for that since Yahoo Finance often provides wrong information. So for the last 4 quarters JKS made $1.36 in GAAP earnings. Based on the current stock price of $44.43 its P/E is 32.7. Some other companies are reported in non-GAAP numbers, which makes them look more attractive to investors. But you should always compare apples to apples.”",Beast0045,5,/r/stocks/comments/maolne/why_is_jks_selling_so_cheap/grtap8a/,0.058,0.899,0.043,-0.4522
729,GOOD," It’s literally just macroeconomics at play - investing in the far-future when interest rates are low IS the play - there is very little risk for the companies if they require debt, for a potentially massive reward. As long term/medium term interest rates increase (10, 30 year), these prospects are less appealing, which is what we’re witnessing now. The poster believes that we will experience NIRP (which would drastically reduce the medium and long term rates) , even after Powell/FED have said time and time again, that they’re not even considering said policy. The debt market coming back is GOOD for the economy, but it unfortunately comes at the cost of speculation. 

Also if this is the start of a bear market in bonds (the bond market has been in a 40 year bull market) then the investing mindset would have to fundamentally change, since the debt/equity market are so intertwined.",ABA61,1,/r/stocks/comments/mao1kc/bubble_recoveries_what_bears_do_not_understand/gru3bql/,0.062,0.841,0.098,0.5609
730,KEY," Fortune teller? That seems like a sensible alternative....

In all seriousness why don't you do the fundamental analysis then you're basically your own analyst?

Or.... research the stock, read what the analysts are saying, make comparisons to similar companies, examine the ratios. Make YOUR OWN investment thesis.

If this was as simple as listening to Analyst recommendations it would be stupid easy to get stupid rich....but it isn't. Analysts are wrong all the time, Barclays guy said sell PLUG at $10, went up to 70 within a few months, imagine going short at 10 after listening to that guy. 

To be constructive though, there are ways to find the best Analysts. I.e. those who have been most often right. You can probably put more weightings on their recommendations and target prices than the average publishing analyst.

The KEY is to listen to everything. But don't put equal (or indeed any) weight to all sources. Just think about everything as a whole and make a judgement.",Loxiaz,1,/r/stocks/comments/mankwy/hot_to_see_when_the_analysts_recommendation_or/grtyqbt/,0.046,0.882,0.072,0.672

This is an incredibly sticky, disruptive company with visionary leadership and explosive growth potential in an industry that’s going to dramatically change in the next 10-15 years. Even around $230/share, there’s a lot of growing left to do.

740,CLF," Right now Im looking at steel companies and commodities. Its an attractive story.

Covid: less production. Covid is gone everyone wants to stimulate economy: inflation.

What gets more expensive? Materials like steel, copper, food etc. Due to high demand, low supply, and inflation

Steel is required to make electric cars, green energy stuff, bridges for infrastructure. Guess what a lot of countries are moving toward now?

Major catalysts (things that might increase stock price a lot) Bidens new infrastructure plan and China cutting steel exports to limit pollution (look up Tangshan).

Other things: HRC futures are high and seem to be high up till next year.

The big company to look at is MT. If you wanna focus more US steel: NUE, X, CLF

That'll play a part in it too.

A sharp rise is going to see people taking profits knowing that it's going to pull back at some point. 

Travelling abroad 2 weeks ago was looking pretty positive, at least here in the UK. I'm currently furloughed from my job at an airport and just 2 weeks ago I was having to update all my training and sent off for a new DBS check.
