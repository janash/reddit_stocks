""Market manipulation is when someone artificially affects the supply or demand for a security (for example, causing stock prices to rise or to fall dramatically).""

Today, January 28th, 2021, Robinhood suspended the ability to trade the tickers GME, AMC, BB, NOK after a meteoric rise yesterday. I believe that this action is in direct response to pressure Robinhood Financial felt from its institutional partners (namely CITADEL), and is in no way representative of a free or legitimate market. While there is inherent risk to investments of all types, Robinhood's removal of the ability to purchase a security/option, and only permitting the sale of a security/option, AFTER allowing the purchasing of such security/option no less than 24 hours ago, constitutes fraud. See clause 13 of FIRNA's prohibited behavior below: 

""13. Using manipulative, deceptive or other fraudulent methods to effect a transaction in, or induce the purchase or sale of, a security."" ([https://www.finra.org/investors/learn-to-invest/choosing-investment-professional/prohibited-conduct](https://www.finra.org/investors/learn-to-invest/choosing-investment-professional/prohibited-conduct))

Robinhood Financial's fraud comes in the form of:

A. Deliberately, artificially, and successfully reversing a free market trend by halting the additional purchase of a commodity while allowing the sale of the same commodity

&#x200B;

B. Deliberately and arbitrarily affecting the supply of a tradable commodity by prohibiting its purchase in direct response to a market trend. 

&#x200B;

C. Deliberately and fraudulently encouraging the sale of a commodity, thus directly affecting the demand for such commodity.

&#x200B;

D. Colluding and/or being influenced by 3rd party institutional firms to reverse free market trends in attempt to prevent financial loss due to short positions against the tickers GME, AMC, BB, NOK",0.114,0.791,0.095,-0.4767

‚ÄúI would like to report blatant and irrefutable market manipulation by several brokerages, namely TD Ameritrade and Robinhood, whereby these brokers restricted the free movement of stock in a free market with the sole intent to suppress the fair value price of the equity. If I (and other retail investors) believe that a stock will gain value after my purchase of it, in a free and fair market I should be allowed to do this. I understand the risks of losing money. I signed forms stating as much. The fact that I am prevented from purchasing more is an absurdity that cannot stand, and if it does then the market is truly not free, and is rigged against the retail investor.

Maybe there needs to be some sort of holding period between the creation of an account and the ability to invest. Will that work? Probably not. I don't know the answer. No one does. But blindly shutting down stocks is not the answer.

The walls will be taken down. The flood gates will open. They can't block the purchase of every trade forever or their apps would seize to exist. Exit out of the app. Turn off your computers. You're going to lose money. Let it sit. Ride it out.

Robinhood wants you to SELL, there is another option they do not want you know (its hidden).

It looks like Robinhood have not had shares that they were selling, they do not have access to enough shares of GME, AMC, BB.

The only option they seem to give you is to SELL. DO NOT DO IT.

There is another option they do not want you to know about: you can request to ""transfer your positions"" to another brokerage.

If    we all file a ‚Äútransfer request‚Äù to transfer our positions instead of    selling, Robinhood will go out of business or will have to purchase    those stocks out of pocket at current price to actually for real    transfer them.

I opened account at    Fidelity not so long ago. Clicked a button on Fidelity website, put  my   account number at Robinhood, there is a checkbox ""Transfer all"" and    that's it. My positions were transferred to Fidelity.

Note: Robinhood says that it costs $75 to transfer your positions. Since I initiated my transfer from Fidelity, it seemed it was free (or Fidelity covered the cost internally, not sure what happened).

TLDR:  Request to ""transfer assets"" from to another brokerage. Robinhood  does   not seem to have had shares that they were selling to us.  Robinhood  will  shit their pants and will be forced (forced by  regulations) to buy shares to actually give them to another brokerage. You avoid selling the shares and hurt the Robinhood bottom line. If a lot of people do it - Robinhood will sink.

I saw people hype AMC and GME when I first joined. It didn't make sense then but obviously those who called it had some insight.

All my funds are tied up so I can't jump in any rockets anyway. Tons of fomo right nowwww. I guess I'm just wondering is there any legitimacy to what is happening or is it just a big FU to Wall Street?

1165,IMO,"I think it is only recently that the new outlook has been given away for HITIF, namely 148M in 2020 in revenue.

This is another great performance. Basically the timing for HITIF to go public was just not smart, they did 2M in revenue in 2018 yet they went public (I believe). Apparently more weedstocks in general had trouble in that time in the market.

Also the recent movement of approving legalisation in more countries is waking up the investors.

The net earnings however were negative untill its last earnings report, where all the bleeding had been done already. Not a lot of eyes were lookin at it anymore but only pot stocks in the US were main focus, preferably on the nasdaq even. With this being a bleeding sheep lots of people dont like to touch it. 

When they confirmed 148M in revenue for 2020 and a nasdaq uplisting and continued doing big acquisitions etc. . I think they gave finally the real bull thesis that they were going down the right path and had shown 2 years of 200%+ growth.

6. If they uplist and you look at peers in the same sector, VFF, OGI, GWCG they trade at way higher multiples. Potential upside of 400-1200%.

1170,ALL,"Hey man...I literally watched RH ALL DAY today...itching...burning to make a move...watching so many opportunities come and go....but I waited. I waited until I chilled the fuck out mentally (took a bong rip with the wife), came back and did a thing.

So this was a big deal for me, I don't make moves *willy nilly*. Can't afford to sadly. Hoping to change that.
