25,IMO," Same, I grew up in Mexico. Literal dirt floors and roof was made of compressed cardboard lined with plastic for ‚Äúwaterproof‚Äù. My dad was recruited by a company that worked with NASA because he was/is one of the best welders. Basically they asked his Mexican company if any welders would like to move to the US and they would fix their legal status. Well my parents saw it as a opportunity to leave everything behind but provide a better life for my siblings and I. 

We arrived in Houston and lived in Pasadena. To be honest, it was very poor place but that was not new to us. The thing that was IMO worse, was the crime. There was (not sure if there still is as we haven‚Äôt lived in Houston for over 20 years) so much gang violence. 

My dad started making really good money, we got in touch with family in the area because we didn‚Äôt have anyone else. My moms cousin had kids around our age at the time. Well, he was suppose to help my parents with basically learning about the US.

He ended up convincing my parents that since we still did not have legal status fixed, that any money my dad made could be taken away by the government. (Yes I know my dad should have known better but he didn‚Äôt) he trusted family and learned a valuable lesson. 

My moms cousin took all of my dads money and told my dad that if he went to the cops my dad would be deported. To make matters worse, the company that recruited my dad, did not keep their end of the deal and basically allowed my dads work visa to expire. 

But thank God that we are now in a better place. I now have more money than I could have ever imagined. But I still IMO live pretty humbly. Because it allows me to help others, to help others that may be taken advantage of just because they don‚Äôt know the culture or language. It also allows me to help those in need, like widows and people who are trying but just having a hard time.

84,DD," As a total juvenile in investing I look at charts going back 1 year under 1 day, 1 week and 1 month increment candlesticks. With these in mind (or printed) I look back at news releases and see how the stock responded to each one to get a 'feel' for the market. I spend a lot more time reading the newest press releases which I can barely understand (financials) so I tend to bounce around the major stock analysis websites to get their opinion on it.

This being said I love mining stocks as things like core results, mining operation costs, resource market price can be learned (at a basic level) somewhat easily for me and I am enjoying learning about the methodology of mining. 

Oh also don't jump on *hothothot* stocks from these forums. I mark them as watched stocks on Yahoo finance and wait for the Reddit pump and dump to subside before moving in after some further research + the posted DD.

129,JAN," I usually invest PINK CURRENT and SAML is my next huge investment. Albeit Fidelity only allows Pink Current to be traded through their platform, I am glad for that rule. Caveat Empire's & Pink with no information can sit around for a bit; up to years and not do a thing. It locks down your money to buy another security. I have seen some stagnant picks take off towards a penny but Pink Current does as well; just wish I could ride all the rockets. 

Pink Current like the previous ones I've flipped (GAXY WDLF GTEH MINE) I bought when they were trip 0's. I got out early and re-investing elsewhere not realizing just waiting could have brought more profit. With the above aforementioned stocks, it seems that there was a pattern of taking off once every 52 weeks. I know companies have to meet certain pricing req's and financial reporting to remain eligible to trade on OTC exchanges let alone labeled current. 

The pattern I've been trying to nail down is when. SAML has reached 52 weeks from last high of 0.0090\~ year to date. I think it needs to return to 1 cent: 1) OTC eligibility 2) Current. There are methods of doing this; the dreaded reverse split, which per SEC filing JAN 06

132,EV," EV (Erin Ventures)

It won‚Äôt be a few weeks, more like 8.  On or before April 15th is the sign off date for a partnership with Temas Resources, regarding a multi billion dollars Boron deposit in Serbia.  Here‚Äôs 5 things that make me optimistic about the partnership and entering into it:

1. Temas seeked Erin out, during a tour in Europe to locate a junior mining company with great potential value, and a unique mineral, similar to what they possess in Quebec, in iimenite, titanium and vadanium minerals. I suspect Temas is trying to grow their new Company and get into the European market to sell their mineral products.

2. The PP announcement on Dec 15th and closed on the Dec 16th, has a 4 month plus 1 day hold period before selling, is kind of a give away don't you think? 4 months +1 day = April 16th.
Obviously the buyer or buyers who jumped in were committed towards the investment and confident with a positive outcome. I suspected it was our potential partner that purchased the shares plus warrants, just an educated guess.

3. The Strategic Alliance that was signed off between Montpelliar Advisary and Cronin Capital who are linked to UAE and Temas respectively is a good thing, as the 3rd party who will pay the cost to drill the Jarandol basin is going to need a lot of revenue to drill it and prove up the tonnage of borates.

4. Another point of iinterest is the recent additional of the elite M&A specialist Mr Kuhn that recently committed to joining Temas, got my attention.Temas is a new Company on the market, inception period June 25, 2018 and it appears to me they want to expand Temas and grow it with uniqe minerals.

5. Lastly, I noticed since the proposed partnership occurred, stock interest has increased substantially, by retailers and institutions. Stock volumes and prices have been on the move upwards, it's refreshing to see. Cheers!

163,IMO," I can agree that we could start to see an overall decrease in cvc infections due to the new cvc end caps and hospitals being incentivized to lower Cvc infections. However, no matter what a hospital does, Cvc infections will happen. Furthermore they are common in the hemodialysis population. So to compare another product....when a patient has an occluded hd cvc one of the most common interventions before a patient is taken to surgery is to use cathflo activase intra catheter. Cathflo is very expensive yet it is cheaper than immediately bringing a patient to surgery. Yet Cathflo is used very frequently in the dialysis population. It‚Äôs almost standard procedure in the hospital setting. Cvc is occluded, try cathflo, if unsuccessful replace the hd cvc or try to manually remove the clot. This could be a good comparison to CTXR‚Äôs product. All this is just IMO though, but with real word knowledge of the medical field.

**Dark/Defunct OTC Companies will be phased out by Sept 30 if they don't begin the process of getting current by June 30.**

SANP is not going to risk that after they just announced their DNATags product and partnership.

Because of this, any Dark/Defunct OTC company that is actively pursuing current status, and also has promising catalysts, is very promising in my opinion.

211,DD," This guy (CEO) is an absolute fraud.   Two years ago he took a gazillion dollars from investors, leaving them empty handed.   Until this past November, like clockwork every 3 months OZSC had one-day runs caused by Conway's pumps.   He runs this business from his kitchen table, and while reports he has employees he doesn't have a single person on the payroll.   

Make no mistake about it - I've been in and out of OZSC several times.  But watch your backs.  This guy is the ultimate pumper, and his news is, when carefully disceted, just vague enough to not constitute misleading investors but easily tricks the quick-reading investors.   Take for example his Tesla talk late last year.   His tweets and Disc activity talked about Tesla a lot, possible this, possible that.  In reality, one guy from Tesla merely asked him about specs for some device (that OZSC wasn't actually producing at that time).  He pumped that truthful inquiry to the moon.  In the end, it went nowhere.  And he never released exaxtly what Tesla could have used it for.   It could have been a single purchase of one device for one robot.  This guy's basement business wasn't going to be a recurring supplier of a part for every car, but Conway was good at not letting those who didn't conduct their own DD know that.  

Invest and make money - truly I hope you all can do this - but keep your finger on the trigger and keep those stop-losses set.

You can day trade with a quick buy and sell, or you can go short term hold, mid term, or long term (buy and forget about it for months).

You can be industry specific or develop your own method of valuation (or future valuation). I will typically buy and hold for two to three months, if I can estimate revenues with general confidence.

265,ACST," I‚Äôm about a year into trading seriously so please take my opinion as you see fit. But I somewhat disagree with you as the transaction still has to make sense. What got me started a year ago was seeing deltas price at a near 70% discount. I knew they‚Äôd be back, just didn‚Äôt know when. I knew COVID would subside, just didn‚Äôt know when. So looking back on what roped me in it was a negative catalyst against a strong company drove the price down. The low price got me to buy and over the rest of the year I earned a 100% return.

I‚Äôve since expanded into pennies and what I‚Äôve seen/experienced is at the low price range you still have to find value. Recently I went in on ACST at .81, went heavy and hoped for short trip to $2. The 52w high is still only around 1.20 or so. I sold a lot of shares at 1.09 because I held for six weeks and didn‚Äôt want my cash held up on a slow stock. Made money, left some there for long term hold and moving on to other opportunities. But the value (price) of .81 is what  created the opportunity.  My mistake on ACST was ignoring the 52h because I convinced myself based on hype I was seeing is that $2 or more was right around the corner. When the 52h was staring me in the face. Just a learning for me to set more realistic expectations. 

In my short tenure I‚Äôm leaning heavier on current price compared to 52w high to gauge good earning opportunities in short periods. These pennies if bought low enough can swing 30-40% and not get close to the high or new highs. Most of the time new highs won‚Äôt be reached anytime soon. So I still buy value and look for 20,30,40% swings to collect on.

Just my thoughts, hope it helps and best of luck to you.",boofizzle,14,/r/pennystocks/comments/loidez/when_researching_a_company_if_99_of_your_results/go5zoyn/,0.054,0.798,0.148,0.9829

Not much profitable on 2020 but the new appointed chairman + opening to US and (broader) European markets are great catalysts IMO.

379,IT," Some DD on a stock I'm really excited about:

Flurotech

TSX: $TEST | OTCQB: $FLURF

They're developing a revolutionary Pandemic Defense and Economic Recovery System. Their tech can rapidly test for COVID19 using saliva at entry ways of stadiums, airports, offices, etc. It is the first testing system that will be Antigen-based with a throughput capacity of 2,500+ tests per hour. They've got a great board with connections to the FDA, which will help with fast tracking authorization. This will be huge in the long run!

Mostly a Covid play with [Purge Virus](https://purgevirus.com/) a disinfectant Co, and some HVAC Co's to install purge virus units into duct work. Also an EV rental Co. And several others.

I Google mapped some of the Co addresses. A couple units in decent office towers, the HVAC and Purge Virus locations didn't look like much or even kinda shady. 

No real recent financial info.
What I read about the main guy seemed interesting. Whether he can make it all come together is the question. But I would think it's going to be a while before all the startup companies will generate any real income, if ever.

Best advice, never buy anything after it's already gone up a lot, your likely to late. If you like the company be patient and buy it on a dip. If it's up a lot there is always a dip coming.

404,TSLA," That's a common misconception - cheaper doesn't mean less risk, it means more volatile. Let's say you invest $100 into a penny stock.

And when they crash, they may never go back up, especially after the last couple weeks where many skyrocketed with new folks entering the market. Well-established stocks have much less fluctuation, typically, outside of outliers like TSLA. My portfolio mostly consists of established stocks that I believe have a future for the long-term. Apple, Microsoft, Walmart and Verizon are my main holds, but you shouldn't base your purchases solely on others on here - I've had those for years. 

Penny stocks are much more of a gamble, and what I do with extra fun money. Sure, ETFM was fun to watch as my investment went up 200% in three days but I held it to see how high it could go, then it crashed on Friday. Oops. But it's my fun money, so I'm not freaking out about it.

Today: all signs point to the reverse merger taking place. And not because I trust their websites, because websites could be put up by anyone, as well as Twitter accounts.  Mark Bolster is listed as CEO for STHC on OTCmarkets.com (not a scam site). And you also have a real, verifiably-real company in agreements with Ameca:  https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/12/14/2144597/0/en/Saint-Jean-Carbon-Announces-Development-Plans-and-Stock-Option-Grants.html

TSNP was looking shady for while, and after its first run people thought it was done. It turns out there's a real company making real products. 

ABML felt like a seriously solid play to me, but at times there were some red flags. Apparently, they are legitimate enough for the US government to give them a grant.

468,PEG," Get a broad idea of the what the company does and what it's objectives are then check the numbers first, if they're not good you don't need to waste any more time digging into possible road blocks like legal issues.

The things to look for depend on the type of stock, for example a fairly new growth stock may have a terrible balance sheet.

As a general rule I look for:

Market Cap*
Revenue (TTM and previous year minimum)
Net Income* (TTM and previous year minimum)
P/S ratio
P/E ratio
PEG ratio
Assets*
Liabilities*
Debt*
Profit Margin

*Net Income, Assets, Liabilities and Debt can be used alongside the market cap to determine whether a stock is under, fairly or over valued.

I then look at the same for 2-4 competitors to see how they're performing in relation to the ""pack"".

If all this checks out, then I dig into things like management experience, news, whether shareholders have been diluted recently or whether it's likely based on their cash runway etc.

Determine risks such as whether it's overbought and could reverse, or any immediate risks identified in checking news about the company.

Check the volumes to see how liquid the stock is. You want to make sure that people will be buying when the time comes to sell.

Then I look at the charts to determine if it's in an uptrend or a downtrend, see if I can spot any patterns. I don't put a huge amount of weight on charting personally, but if a stock is in an uptrend over a few months and the previous research explains why it's in an uptrend, and the divergence of averages is expanding, chances are it will stay in an uptrend for a while.

Once all that's done I estimate what I think a good entry price would be, and use some trend lines and/or news catalysts to determine a good exit price and a rough time frame for reaching it.

471,MS," I received my MS where I spent 2 years studying actinides (Thorium, Uranium and Neptunium), and this is what I can tell you:

&#x200B;

1. Thorium has much less unique chemistry than later/heavier actinides. This means that even though there is more of it, it is much more cubersome to isolate and purify.
2. Thorium reactors are more expensive to produce and maintain since they require insane amounts of heavy (deuterated) water which is very expensive (about $1K for 1Kg going off of Sigma Aldrich's website).
3. Thorium reactors are extremely unprofitable short-term as they don't produce net positive energy for quite a few months.
4. Uranium is more popular because it can be made into nuclear weapons
5. Thorium still doesn't solve the massive problem (at least in the US) where we still have no idea what to do with this waste even though there will be less of it. Right now barrels of nuclear waste are leaking into the environment due to the radioactive waste literally destroying them. The radiactivity of the waste will not go down any appreciable amount for at least 10K years. It's quite a challenge to design container that will not fail for that long of a time.",Jubs300,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/lotfef/recent_popularity_on_nuclear_energyuranium_stocks/go9hb4p/,0.15,0.807,0.043,-0.9721

473,SOS," Personally, I'd at least scale back and pull out a) your original investment and b) a happy amount of profit. So then in a worst case scenario, you are up that profit plus whatever you sell your remaining shares for.

Additionally or alternatively, set a stop trigger for 50% of your shares and let it ride. Not sure what stop amount you want, you basically want catastrophic insurance, so $1 may be enough I have no idea. I feel like SOS has been above $10.50 consistently enough that it will either go up from here  or you will be happy selling at $10.5.

I'll note that this would have triggered a few times by now, so if you think it will peak again and want to really give it room to go up and down, set a combination stop trigger and stop limit... Set the stop trigger something high enough to let it go up and down, but the stop limit is your floor. So right now I'd use $10.5 as the floor with a generous stop trigger and as it rises, you can bump up the floor and/or tighten the trigger to get closer to the peak.",PsycheRevived,4,/r/pennystocks/comments/loijtq/crazy_week_but_still_holding/go6rj7z/,0.101,0.789,0.109,0.1623

491,DD," To lose money, by selling too soon, you would have to be selling at a loss and/or panic selling. 

The best way to avoid that is hold longer, obviously, but that comes with the terrifying 'what if i lose it all' thought. You fight that by being more confident in your stock picks, which in turn comes with better DD. If the company is good enough, you can hold through dips and not be worried. Yea, you lose theoretical money through opportunity cost, but you don't actualize any losses. Being a 'bagholder' for a decent company is fine, so long as your entry point wasn't at the top of the pump. Knowing if you're at the top of the pump can be hard, so its best to always buy on a dip. Never buy anything that is at the most its every been, or at least the most its ever been in the last year or so.",BioSemantics,8,/r/pennystocks/comments/logurl/does_flipping_pennies_work_as_well_as_you_balance/go62fry/,0.147,0.687,0.166,0.8309

493,RSI," I check the chart first, looking to see how pumped it is, its general trenD, and what its market cap is. Then I check the less empirical stuff, as that weeds out bad companies faster. This is stuff like, website, products, news. If I don't like what I see, then I move on. If it looks reasonable, I look at the stock itself. What % is institutional, insider. How much float is there? Recent volume? Then I look at financials. Are they making money? Do they have deals in the pipeline? How much debt? At this point, I add it to my watch list if its looking good. For shorter term plays, swing trades and the like, you learn to look at RSI and where things are headed. If you think it has decent longer term hold potential, as some penny stocks do, you don't really need to worry about it. Just buy a reasonable amount on a dip, set some alerts, and leave it.",BioSemantics,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/logurl/does_flipping_pennies_work_as_well_as_you_balance/go6bdkl/,0.061,0.859,0.079,0.4582

IQST IMO has the potential to run up within the range of $7-$9. Clearly a lot more growth there.

586,MARA," My goal with each trade is 20%. However I also scale out, so I will sell some at 10%, 15%, 20%, and usually hold a small amount to sell at 25-30% if it looks like it will get there.

Now having said that, I adjust my selling points based on what the stock price is doing, resistance points, and psychological points. If my 20% PT is 1.02, I‚Äôll usually set that sale at 0.95 due to the $1 psychological point and typical resistance. However, if the stock price is surging without signs of resistance, I will ride it out a little more, and set a trailing stop.

Sometimes you miss out by selling too early, but you need to be ok with it. I bought and sold MARA twice at the end of Jan, riding it from the 17.50 range to 19-20 as a PT and making a nice profit.... now it‚Äôs over 40 a share. I made 2k on 1000 shares the last time, but missed out on over 20k selling when I did. I‚Äôm fine with it because 95% of the time a stock either stays around where I sold it, or drops back down.",Garweft,3,/r/pennystocks/comments/low6g8/how_to_know_when_to_sell/go874iy/,0.029,0.888,0.082,0.8847

588,PT," Setting a 300% increase is not a realistic PT. Like most here, I set a goal of 20-30% as a realistic goal.

Selling at 0.05 was good enough.
