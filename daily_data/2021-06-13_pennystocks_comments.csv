0,AMC, Nice! I never had bought a stock or cryptocurrency till I downloaded robinhood and bought dogecoin. I was always interested a little. Then I heard about AMC on twitter and bought in round 13 a share I'm poor so I only got XX shares but learning alot about the market here on Reddit. Seems you've done well for yourself!

14,DD," If you're trying to learn, penny stocks aren't a great place to start.  They seem appealing because they're cheap per share, but they're highly volatile.  It's also much harder to do good research because of very limited information.  The aforementioned meme stocks also mean that there's a lot of momentum trading right now, so that DD might not even matter.

As a new investor you don't want to pick many individual stocks.  Idiosyncratic risk is going to be the most dangerous thing for someone new.

My advice would be to get your feet wet by mostly investing in index funds, and only dabbling with some ETFs in sectors you find promising.

So three months pass and it’s September. The stock has been doing poorly and your puts(bet against stock rising) are now worth more $4 a contract or $400.

I believe GE will be worth less than $13 a share or less by September 17 2021. So I want to buy the put now for .65 cents per share. I don’t have the choice of say 50 shares. I have to buy one or multiple contracts(100 shares*.65(contract premium). In this) case I’m buying one contract at .65 so I will pay a premium of $65. So when September 17 comes and the price of GE is $14 I’m out my $65 at market close. 

If it is September 17th or before and GE is $12 then I can exercise my put option and sell 100 shares at the strike price of $13. So I would get $1,00 -$65(initial cost of premium) so $35 profit

Being listed on the Russell 3000 index after close of business is going to make a huge difference. Not only does every fund manager that mimics the Russell index have to buy shares in ATOS, the price and liquidity of the shares will make it easier for more trading as it becomes a small cap stock and no longer pennystock. Some funds,  like insurance companies retirement plans can't buy pennystocks lower than consistently $5 per share. As long as 1) You haven't over extended yourself with how much you invested and that you need that money back ASAP- you can wait it out and 2) Don't panic and set a stop loss. Don't set up a stop loss. All it takes is a 30 second sudden drop in price and then rebound and your stock is sold at a loss. If anything,  set Margin Sale trades for $20 a share or more. It ties up your stock from some clearing house ""borrowing"" it to cover their trade.

Good luck. Have patience. This is a biotechnology stock that is a long hold vs. a day trade.

75,ATOS," First things first, it’s never a good idea to go all in, even if you potentially could make massive gains on one trade, you also stand to lose a massive amount too.
Secondly selling to take profits is always the way to go even if you do miss out on some profit, have your trading plan incorporate minimum profit take. Also pretty handy to lock in some profits on the way up. 
Third, try not to ever believe to heavily into the hype around a stock. Like this post about sentiment for example. It’s a good thing to have in hand with the rest of your cards but be careful they can crash all the same as they can grow.

ATOS I can’t say for sure how high it can go. No one knows that about any stonk. Theoretically speaking any stonk can blast off and go higher than high. But that doesn’t mean it will even if all the right things fall into place. If you’re happy with your gain take the sale and buy other stonks. If you believe you can get more out of it. Sell some and continue on with other trades. Best of luck (this non advisory financial advice make your own choices based on your own research)

Lastly make sure you use charts and study your indicators and watch for catalysts and volume etc. nothing wrong with smaller plays and smaller gains. Especially if your playing it safe, you’re still winning. Don’t FOMO, that includes making sure you don’t beat yourself up cause you were afraid of the losses and didn’t buy in. If I did had to make a guess I’d say atos reaching 6+ again, maybe even 8-10. But eh if it doesn’t that’s cool too.

If you get in on TRCH, the shares will transfer over to MMAT during the merger. MMAT is going to be the first publicly traded metamaterials company on NASDAQ. Right now they hold a bunch of patents and are working with a whole slew of vendors to get the technology built and sold.

There was an article recently of Bill Gates and other venture capitalists offering a lot of money to start up companies getting into the metamaterials sector. MMAT will have quite a bit head start over any competition.

Also check out the whole space exploration goals that NASA and other groups are working towards. Obviously very long term, but metamaterials will be crucial in developing the tech to power those flights with solar sails and such.

95,TRCH," They will automatically convert to 100 MMAT shares after merger and TRCH will stop existing.

One added benefit to the merger (and part of why j have more TRCH than MMATF) is that TRCH is also distributing a dividend based on the sale of their oil and gas assets.

They are selling land and equipment and liquidating all of it. The sale of those are then given to the shareholders. Unfortunately no one knows the amount of that dividend - estimates range from $1-20 per share. I’m hoping for $3-5.

So at merger the 100 TRCH become 100 MMAT + 100x the dividend amount.

98,TRCH," MMATF holders are receiving 3 shares (between 3 and 3.7) for every share they hold, but receive none of the dividend from the asset sales. Which is why I hold shares in both.

Unfortunately since MMATF is on the Canadian OTC, you may or may not have access to them in every broker. Robinhood doesn’t have MMATF. Fidelity charges an additional $50 per trade.

Thats a big reason I went into TRCH since I can buy small lots at a time and work my way up. The other reason is that I am betting that the dividend will be at least $3-5 - which would make my shares completely free. MMATF holders will get more shares, and reduce their cost basis. But TRCH shares are free with the dividend.

100% TRCH shares go over 1:1

MMATF holders get somewhere between 3-3.7 - which is dependent on several factors.

And the price of the new ticker MMAT is coming from TRCH. So even though you get more shares with MMATF, currently the price is 150%, so that lowers that value.

But for me I am 100% believing the dividend price will pay for each of my shares. Is a $0/share worth more or a $1/share worth more?",xhavez,3,/r/pennystocks/comments/nypu0x/baby_investor_looking_to_get_serious/h1mx5iq/,0.042,0.766,0.192,0.9862

116,RSI," VBI Vaccines Inc. VBIV has moved higher as of late, but there could definitely be trouble on the horizon for this company. That is because VBIV is now in overbought territory with an RSI value of 71.79.

What is RSI?

RSI stands for ‘Relative Strength Index’ and it is a popular indicator used by technically focused investors. It compares the average of gains in days that closed up to the average of losses in days that closed down; readings above 70 suggest an asset is overbought, while an RSI below 30 suggests undervalued conditions are present.

Other Factors

Yet VBIV’s high RSI value isn’t the only reason for investors to be concerned, as there has been some decidedly negative earnings estimate revisions VBI Vaccines’ stock as of late. This is especially true when investors dive into some of these revisions in order to get a better picture of VBIV’s prospects for the near term.

Over the past one month, investors have witnessed 1 earnings estimate revision lower compared to none higher for the current year. The consensus estimate for VBIV’s has also been on a downward trend over the same time period too, as the estimates have fallen 11.1% over the last two months.

If this wasn’t enough, VBI Vaccines also has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) which puts it into unfortunate company among its peers. So, given all of these factors, investors may want to consider exiting this stock now before it falls back to Earth.

117,VBIV," VBI Vaccines Inc. VBIV has moved higher as of late, but there could definitely be trouble on the horizon for this company. That is because VBIV is now in overbought territory with an RSI value of 71.79.

What is RSI?

RSI stands for ‘Relative Strength Index’ and it is a popular indicator used by technically focused investors. It compares the average of gains in days that closed up to the average of losses in days that closed down; readings above 70 suggest an asset is overbought, while an RSI below 30 suggests undervalued conditions are present.

Other Factors

Yet VBIV’s high RSI value isn’t the only reason for investors to be concerned, as there has been some decidedly negative earnings estimate revisions VBI Vaccines’ stock as of late. This is especially true when investors dive into some of these revisions in order to get a better picture of VBIV’s prospects for the near term.

Over the past one month, investors have witnessed 1 earnings estimate revision lower compared to none higher for the current year. The consensus estimate for VBIV’s has also been on a downward trend over the same time period too, as the estimates have fallen 11.1% over the last two months.

If this wasn’t enough, VBI Vaccines also has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) which puts it into unfortunate company among its peers. So, given all of these factors, investors may want to consider exiting this stock now before it falls back to Earth.

My first thought was why would a defunct Pink sheet company have such a huge positive change in share price and what is the incentive to invest in these companies? I am understanding more now after some digging. 

How are you finding out about some of these tickers you have made gains from? What kind of DD do you do before purchasing shares in some of these companies? Have you been lucky enough to buy before a big run for any of your tickers, or have you bought into a run and still seen some success?

I got burned buying up all sorts of weed stocks when it became legal in Canada/in some US states. A lot of companies over produced and couldn't sell resulting in massive losses and more incurred debt to keep companies afloat. A lot of them were scams too.
