15,CCL," I hear this all the time but I have also seen this twice already in my lifetime and I am sure it has happened before. Like everything though with social media and media in general coverage of everything is making everyone more aware.

Leading up to Dotcom and housing bubbles I had many friends investing all over the map some won and some lost.

I lost on the dotcom and learned - value and somewhat growth invested after that and did not really even feel the housing bubble (income sure did! but not investments). Took the downturn as a chance to double down on many stocks I already owned for years.

Honestly plan on doing the same again with the next bubble - did it last year with a small amount during March/Covid - still holding some CCL and DAL.

As other have said long term investment/planning - these short term moves may not make since all the time (mainly I believe because we do not look far enough out)

Specifically to Lowes - Lumber appears it might be hitting a bubble (futures off 27% from highs); housing starts are way off due to high costs; Inflation concerns might lead to an interest rate hike - all of which leads to less spending on building materials going forward. SO while they had a good report the future is looking pretty sketchy.

ALSO keep in mind a lot of HD/Lowes spending is from people stuck at home last year. The money that was spent last year on renovations will be moved back to paying for travel and many are expecting it to be a big swing to travel to the point of taking the renovation businesses to a point lower than pre-pandemic.

As for the other companies you listed - sorry none of them would even be on my radar to invest in - call me to conservative - just too many good solid companies (long term) to look at.

Earnings don't matter. Price-per-unit of current and discounted future earnings matters.

Checking yahoo finance, LOW has a forward PE of about 20... reasonable, not amazing, but it has a PEG of 1.44, which is not very good at all.

What does this mean? It means that the future growth of the company is slowing down. So while the Price-per-unit of earnings (PE), is reasonable, the projected PE to Earnings Growth (PEG), that is, the relative price per unit of projected earnings is high. So, some might say is likely that *future* earnings will be worth less than earnings today... which means the stock might not be a good idea to buy right now.

*Literally, you have a company coining it in, and the share price is*   
*dropping*

Weeding out paperhanded bitches who have so much money they never have to actually step foot in a Lowes store to find out for themselves how much better in every way they are than Home Depot. It's really not hard to figure out, did you even check the short interest?

If stocks with $150B market caps are able to be manipulated like you think that is a problem with WAAAAAAY too many speculators vs actual investors. THAT is what you need to be concerned with, and that's an issue with the overall market right now, not any one particular ticker. I get the rant, but earnings plays are really low hanging fruit that any simp can do if they have about 45 minutes to listen to some overpaid prick talk on a shitty VOIP.

Do your own DD, which it seems like you did, and knew well enough to not step on a landmine setting itself up for a juicy short. So what if it some bullshit pharma company went up today? What if it goes down even harder tomorrow? Wouldn't you look silly ranting about things that go up on speculation today, and down for the same reason tomorrow?

If you don't understand casino market dynamics, the best bet is to not play. Of course isn't a casino, and anyone who tells you that is either a butthurt moron who buys mutual funds, or a liar trying to hustle you. Wall Street right now is a digital ghetto where hedge fund crackheads are chasing every gain they can because the free money supply is gone, they bought too much crack too high and sold it too low, and their dealer wants his money. Bubble crack is what happens when powder goes up, and they want that magic gain powder more than Bubba wants to suck gasoline out of a dry Colonial pipeline so his truck nutz go brrr. If they can step on some and sling it back for a few bucks, they'll do it with theta crew. Game theory, all the way down. Did you see what happened to AAPL right before it's stellar Q1 report? 10% down in power hour. Apple, the company that always goes up! Why? Why didn't it go 10% up? Because someone got called on GME...

Do you believe in the stock? Is it at a good price? Then buy it and forget about it! If it goes down buy more! It's full-court press hustle mode right now to get as much money out of retail as possible while throwing shade at nervous investors to make them flinch. Just like you said, earnings don't matter and that's the short term market outlook this year. Too much money fueling too much speculation. 2021 has a lot of smoldering embers after the brushfire of last year with massive amounts of money entering and moving toward gains gaining more gains. Lots of solid long term investment material is buried under massive short interest that couldn't be taken care of because the GME nuclear bomb got armed. If you are on the wrong side of that deal it's full-court press mode to rustle up enough cash to survive getting called. If you are smart enough to search out heavily shorted tickers with great DD and want to sit on them as investments, you'd be pretty damn smart right about now. I got a gold mine I've been watching with 1700% short interest that's gonna be melting ingots in Q4 and has 25% more gold than they originally thought, giving them a 10 year supply. And someone just wrote calls!

The market is massively overleveraged, every boring investment ticker is overpriced, and money isn't coming in because investors simply don't have any more money they can squeeze from the labor force, or are getting ready to buy the dip by riding the bond rocket. Bonds are going crazy, more than justified by the rate increase or speculation on further increases; same dynamics at play. Where is more money going to come from for stocks? Main Street is in the shitter and folks don't have money to support realistic P/E ratio gains as it is! Meanwhile those stocks are already massively overpriced anyway because of hedge funds hustling each other and stealing from low-info paperhanded retailers to keep pumping overvalued reserve holdings to justify getting more and more leverage to keep hustling smaller gains. It's a positive feedback cycle that can only end when something breaks down.

The crack game here worked until retail bought all the crack on a block and put it in the paper. Now the cops are discussing watching the streets, the powder supply got tightened, and hustlers suddenly can't afford to sling anymore. What happens when crackheads can't get their crack? They rob and steal whatever isn't nailed down to pay for crack. And if they can't pay the crack broker back for what they already sold or smoked? Someone gets a bullet to the face. Don't be the guy catching the bullet. When you hear the music stop, find the nearest chair and bludgeon anyone trying to take it from you.

56,GME," You are the person in 2006 that thought the housing market couldn't crash. 

No one knows where GME price will go, but they are using the psychological tool called anchoring to raise expectations. In January, the target was 420.69. It has steadily been raising as more manipulation has occurred up to 10million as the floor now. 

There is evidence to support that it is still heavily shorted (most likely naked shorted). Easiest verifiable info is look at institutional ownership that is over 100%, which isn't possible without a large number of shorts. 

You can put your head in the sand and think the game isn't rigged, or you can join the group and buy a few shares. For some good information, listen to the recent interview with a lawyer that has been trying these types of cases for 20 years.

For what it's worth, I made $40,000 on GME shares and calls. But the cult-like mentality that began to develop in WSB and the spin-off subs, the delusional beliefs that began to appear like the short squeeze was some kind of messianic prophecy, conveyed that it was time to bail.

To me the results of the call didn't look bad, and Ark also immediately bought the dip, so I sold half of $AMD at a loss in hope of $U's quick rebound. I still hold both positions, $AMD is barely $75 right now, $U is $90, overall I lost like 30% on this.

251,AAWW," Big thanks for the honest critique. I bought into Intel mostly because of its name. My impression of Intel going in was that it was a strong company with a solid credibility in the processor industry. That likely clouded my judgment when I read its earnings reports and compared it to AMD’s. I was aware that Intel had lost some ground, but for me at the time, it was a temporary hiccup. After all, it’s Intel, the king of microprocessors; why can’t they recover? Maybe it’s that same clouded judgment that’s making me hold it for the long run (or maybe it’s because it pays dividends, unlike AMD and Nvidia).

As for Moderna, consider it a major lesson learned. I’d successfully chased earnings for four straight stocks prior to Moderna (flipped both ATVI and AAWW on the same day for more than a $200 profit), so I was very much hyped for its earnings to get me some quick cash. Well, now I’m stuck with it until it crawls back up to 178 again because my stubborn ass refused to sell at a loss.

As for Tesla, the only indication that it would surge for a third day was that it surged for two straight. As I said, chalk that failed chase attempt to complete lack of experience.",ZhangtheGreat,4,/r/stocks/comments/nfrmgh/worst_buys_youve_made_this_year_so_far/gynox5d/,0.119,0.794,0.088,-0.8537

348,IMO," If they can be the first to solve autonomy, they would have a car that can drive itself.  No reason to buy any other car.  They would need to scale and make several million cars per year.  Even after other companies solve autonomy, there would still be some brand loyalty to Telsa, much like the brand loyalty to Apple.

Then they would launch an app store in the cars.  Think how much Apple makes with app store.

They might launch a robotaxi network.  If they cannot scale fast enough they could lease the autonomous driving software to other companies as SaaS.

There is also there energy product, insurance, battery technology, and artificial intelligence innovations, which could have big potential.  But IMO the key is autonomy.  They have the most data, so they will probably be first to solve it.  If they do, there are huge profits.  It is possible they do not.

349,FSD," Personally, I would highly encourage you to do the math on what full autonomy would earn Tesla and what this would mean for their market cap.

* Estimate how many Tesla's you expect to be on the road in 2030. They are expecting 50% annual growth, with much higher growth in 2021 and 2022 and lower near the end of the decade.
* Estimate how many people will buy a FSD subscription if the software is truly autonomous and allows individuals and companies to deploy their Teslas as robotaxis for almost 1/10th the price of Uber/Lyft, as well as individual owners to get work done or watch a movie while they're driving.
* Multiply that number by $400 (conservative estimate for what an FSD subscription would cost per month when the software is perfect)
* Multiply that number by 12 for annual revenue
* Multiply that number by 0.9 for operating margins (almost pure margins)
* Multiply that number by 0.8 to get Net Income
* Multiply that number by a realistic PE multiple to get the Market Cap by 2030

I got to a market cap of $6,5T. Obviously this would only apply if they do solve full autonomy without anyone else solving it around the same time, but it goes to show how absolutely astronomic the market opportunity for autonomous driving software is.",Ehralur,0,/r/stocks/comments/ng2d39/next_set_of_trillion_dollar_companies/gypq11g/,0.014,0.894,0.091,0.8787

Or are you simply hawking waiting for the dip. I am building a div part of my ISA to hold long, but I'm just not sure what to make of it, sure I can get 7% dividend, but that's no good if the shares are worthless (unless I have massive piles of money, which I don't 🤔).

We have people that don't want to trust a vaccine in the middle of a deadly pandemic. Tons of people are afraid of flying, even thought statistically it's far safer than driving. People want to feel in control, people don't trust technology (especially with their lives), and people especially don't want to trust stuff like AI, we have an entire movie subgenre dedicated to the idea of AI/robots rebelling and killing people. 

Aside from plenty of totally reasonable reasons to not buy a Tesla (can't afford a new car, want a feature Tesla doesn't offer, just prefer manual driving, want to access areas not well serviced by Tesla's charging network, want to take long road trips that would be hindered by Tesla's slow charge speeds, brand loyalty to other manufacturers, etc.) there are tons of less reasonable/rational reasons that people will be against autonomous driving because people are not rational creatures. 

>Even after other companies solve autonomy, there would still be some brand loyalty to Telsa, much like the brand loyalty to Apple.

Most people who are going to give their brand loyalty to a car brand already have, and the kind of deep running auto brand loyalty that is out there isn't going to be swayed to Tesla by getting FSD a few years before everyone else. Apple's brand loyalty isn't predicated on doing something first, it's predicated on the fact that Apple consistently produces products that merit it. Tesla has definitely generated some strong brand loyalty for itself over the past few years, but most people either don't hold strong brand loyalties, are already have a car brand that they're loyal too, and I don't see that changing to a degree that would influence future sales. Tesla needs to be making better products at competitive prices if they want to keep whatever market share they gain from having a first mover advantage. 

>They might launch a robotaxi network. If they cannot scale fast enough they could lease the autonomous driving software to other companies as SaaS.

Which would still require Tesla's hardware, which in this scenario isn't being produced fast enough. Also, while SaaS is great for a company's bottom line, as a consumer it's a gross practice. I would never buy a vehicle that tries to exploit my wallet further through SaaS or subscription models, and I'll never understand why Tesla fanboys are so excited about this from a consumer perspective. It also runs into the problems with AI I mentioned above.

>There is also there energy product, insurance, battery technology, and artificial intelligence innovations, which could have big potential.

All of which are predicated on Tesla's success with cars. 

>They have the most data, so they will probably be first to solve it

That's not how AI advancements work. Data is one component, but there is so much more. I keep seeing this line parroted around, but it simply isn't the case. There's no doubt that Tesla is *one of* the industry leaders in this area, but they aren't alone and their moat isn't as big as most people think. 

>The stock price has been so high recently because a lot of people are betting that they will solve it within 5 years.

If the bet is that we will have fully working FSD tech being relatively accessible in all 50 states with no more regulatory hurdles to clear by 2025 (seeing as Tesla's price took off in 2020), I wouldn't touch those odds with someone else's money.

374,XL," Broadly the market is going against Suncor.

Things were looking up from 2016-2020.  They had bought out their direct competitor and owned a majority share in Canadian Oilsands.  With Trump in office it looked as though the Keystone XL was going to be built which would be a new major route for the company to ship its oil. On top of this the Canadian government bought the Trans Mountain Pipeline from Kinder Morgan with hopes of expanding it to further increase the company's exports.  It had amazing growth potential.

That's simply not the case anymore.  Keystone XL is dead and Trans Mountain is in some very long term construction delays that means it won't be operational for at least a couple more years.  Worse yet Michigan is considering ending export permits for the Line 5 pipeline would mean severe cuts in sales to Ontario.

I'm sure Suncor will be worth a very short term gain coming up as the US economy starts rolling again (and right now it's at an insanely discounted price after a lot of dumping).

436,DKNG," Not at all, their guidance is basically praying the NFL boost is so big they don't go bankrupt next year.

Like, yeah, I'm sure they'll be able to write out some notes and push off all the cash burning into 2023 -- but it's a nine year old company. There's a lot of mouths to feed. 

The IPO was to develop enough equity to take money from bag holders who bought post-IPO and give it to their elaborate money burning enterprise in back. Now the stock price is even better than they probably could've imagined, but the future is still the same. Write out some more debt against equity, good luck anyone getting their money back this side of 2024

As far as I'm concerned if DKNG is remotely making money in 2024 then they would've proven their own guidance wrong. In that case I'll buy their stock at $15 or $16 or whatever it is then. Maybe then they'll really moonshot. 

Worst case scenario they begin their moonshot in 2023 when their EBITDA hits ""only"" -10 and I'm marginally late to the ride. But if they're really going to moonshot in a haze of regulatory jizzing and cooming to some low margin gambling company, it'd be like getting into Amazon at 20$.

If something like that were to happen with steel I imagine it wouldn't be good. Although I find this unlikely, it's a possibility. 

Airplanes believe it or not I would short or sell, I would only hold southwest airlines, as only domestic flights in US are actually going to resume at a decent rate. With inflation happening as well, I'm not sure what I would do with airlines. People have wild expectations for these stocks but don't realize how indebted these companies are, american airlines is mired in debt, and has a pretty bad balance sheet to support their ridiculous rally. 

Restaurants and retail are dependant on an individual company basis as well. Certain companies have pricing power during inflation, some don't. Evaluate that, as it's only going to get more wobbly. But you're in the right place with industrials right now, I think it's rocky but my main conviction plays right now are oil, (similar concept to your steel) and financials with a touch of healthcare as a hedge for inflation.

I mainly buy shares and hold to invest, but oil I'm taking a swing approach and planning to sell most of my position when I reach my goal, and then hold the rest for long, that may be a good idea with your steel as well, as they are both ""commodities"" that are undergoing a massive cycle.

You have to look at the prospectus and holdings of every ETF to know what it's really dealing in. Many are a little misleading.

For instance, PAVE calls itself an infrastructure ETF, but includes a bunch of railroad operators. Infrastructure to them is a cost and the thing they operate, not what they generate as a business. They're transport companies, so putting them in a builders group is mixing up concepts.

571,AMD," Be careful. That guy just told you to buy stocks that have been on a losing spree for a bit. This isn't the market cycle for frothy tech stocks. I'm a fan of semiconductor plays like , QCOM, Lam research, AMD and intel (long hold, short is hairy.) I like big tech with good earnings and decently low peg and pe multiples. Tech is presenting some good buying opportunities, but the market is rampant with companies that just simply won't make it. Stick to blues chip names that have gotten beaten up and dca into a solid position. Anything else speculative, may be comparable to catching a falling knife.

Apph isn't terrible and has promise. 

EV is solid, but very expensive for most investments right now, as most don't turn a profit. Tesla barely even turns a profit and is the first mover. To play this space, I would go with legacy automakers like Gm or ford or volkswagen, as they are on a path to integrate EVs into their lineups. 

Other than automakers, I would buy lithium miners like Livent or albemarle. Precious metals like palladium and rhodium related stocks may also be good buys because PGM metals are used in EV cars as well as ICE cars.

578,DM," My thoughts on $LAC
They’re well positioned to meet the impending rise in demand for battery grade lithium carbonate in terms of their Argentinian project. Production will begin in 2022, they have a partnership with Gangfeng for a large amount of the product (70%) to be bought at market price insuring the company will have a off supply. Gangfeng just made moves to open a lithium battery operation in the same town as the Argentina mine, which gives me more indications that the mine will take off. Gangfeng is very well established and they sunk a considerable amount of money into developing the mine with LAC. LAC’s other operation is a bit more tenuous in terms of funding (they still need a major partner) but they have gotten a groundbreaking environmental document. I work in environmental regulations, the ROD they got for Thacker Pass puts them in a trajectory to meet the upcoming demand in 5-10 years. 

The lower price point should make it an easy stock to pick up, I’ll bet you’ll see a rise this year when they obtain their water rights and land rights for Thacker pass and in quarter one of 2022 when they announce production in Argentina. 

I’ve spent a good amount of time researching LAC, the lithium market, mining techniques as well as my background in environmental regulations. I think it’s a good long term bet (6 months to a year), and then an even better bet longer term since EV is on the rise including being supported by many governments like the US who just made a major pledge! There’s lots of areas I identified where you’ll see a price rise in the next year, buying now I feel confident that I’ll be able to sell off my shares at considerable profit. I currently have invested roughly 40% of my investment budget into them at 13.27 average a share.

616,RE," High rate = can’t afford the interest on an expensive house. 

Low  rate = can afford a more expensive house with lower interest payment.

Win = wait for the correction and pay cash. 

Buying RE now seems like buying the top to me. I was in the market for a house before Covid. When RE prices went crazy I decided to rent for a while longer. I did the same thing during the the last recession and sold for a nice profit a few years later. Plan to do the same thing again this time. When markets are this hot, a major correction is almost certainly around the corner. 20-30% price increases on RE in 1 year is not healthy growth. The correction will come. Be patient - it’ll probably be here sooner than you think.",_Marlon_Rando_,2,/r/stocks/comments/nfmjql/good_time_to_invest_in_real_estate/gyngdcw/,0.106,0.742,0.152,0.8208

619,TSLA, I mean TSLA is the king of P/E. It has come down quite a bit but I believe is still around 600 which is insane. Especially if you consider that if you take out govt. subsidies and b-coin gains it isnt even profitable. Government subsidies will diminish greatly over next few years as more manufacturers enter the EV space. But it is Elon so rules dont apply.,steveste1,1,/r/stocks/comments/ngepa8/stocks_with_bad_fundamentals/gyqu0ly/,0.094,0.862,0.044,-0.5513
