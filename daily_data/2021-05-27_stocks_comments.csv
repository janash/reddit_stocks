20,MGM," I largely agree with you and own the stock. However, here's a few things for you to consider:

1. Who do you think is going to acquire them? Realistically, you have 3 potential buyers - Netflix, Apple, and Amazon. I do not think Time Warner/Discovery is going to buy them because they seem to be also trying to sell themselves and used a corporate structure that is pretty much designed for just that. They are too big for anyone else

Netflix does not acquire content through acquisitions. They create their own. This has been their policy for a few years now.

Apple has a history of avoiding acquisitions. They are a 2Tn dollar company and the largest acquisition they made was only 3Bn dollars. In 2015, they had the chance to acquire Time Warner, which is a much larger and higher quality asset. They also had more than enough cash to do it. However, they walked away.

[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/25/apple-2015-time-warner-bundling-negotiations-almost-led-to-acquisition.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/25/apple-2015-time-warner-bundling-negotiations-almost-led-to-acquisition.html)

Amazon just acquired MGM studios for 8.5Bn. While I do think they are the most likely of the 3, they need time to digest MGM before making more acquisitions. Why would they not wait and see how their previous multibillion-dollar acquisition goes before making another? Also, you get big issues with antitrust.

2) Their valuation is low as a multiple of earnings. However, I would recommend you take a closer look at where those earnings are coming from. Substantially all of their profit comes from linear TV, which is being phased out in favour of streaming. In other words, most of their profits are in a declining market. They will not last longer unless they can successful build a streaming platform, which is far for certain. Netflix deserves a higher P/E because they are the dominant company in a growing industry that is taking over from linear TV and companies like ViacomCBS, giving them faster growth and a brighter future. Discovery's multiples are all screwed up because of their deal with Time Warner. Neither are great comps. I think using ViacomCBS's own valuation metrics before Archegos is a better idea. The company seems fairly valued. I would not expect it to double or increase 5x.

3) Be careful of sports. Unlike other content (movies, TV series, etc), they have almost no value after the live broadcast. The current deal requires them to pay billions to the NFL each year2033. In order to make more money off future super bowls, viacomCBS would need to enter a bidding war and win from competitors like Amazon, who are willing to lose billions on their video platforms for the next few years. In other words, the value of future super bowls is mostly going to be realized by the NFL and not ViacomCBS. In fact, I think there is a very good chance they could lose future super bowl broadcasts in a few years. Contrast that with the James Bond franchise. Past movies will continue to have some value and MGM is almost guaranteed to make money on the next sequel. Ever wonder why there are a thousand Fast and Furious movies?

31,MGM," I personally do not see an apple buyout. They’re a company who’s whole thing is control and curation, and a buyout would mean they get a flood of content that doesn’t match the shows that they have been making for TV+. 

If they were going to buy their way in they would have done it by now. Apple could buy almost anyone with the cash pile they have, including stuios like lionsgate, MGM before Amazon bought them, Fox before Disney bought them, at one point people were talking about them buying Netflix. But it’s not like apple needs a studio for a content library in the first place. They have so much cash that they could fund extensive content creation for a decade and still have billions in the bank. Just for reference, apple has approximately $200B in cash on hand that they are always adding more to, and Netflix revenue as a company is $25B per year.

35,TV," Agreed. I'm long the stock right now and traded it earlier this year for a decent gain, but between the debt, current market cap and the control premium, there's a substantial chance they are kind of in no man's land on the M&A front. I think Netflix or Apple could pull it off, but other than them, I'm not so sure and I don't know if Shari would want stock, which would make it a really hard deal to get done. 

Their streaming platform is trash. Biggest dud launch ever. They have a deep content pool, but when you have Fist of Fury as your number 2 top movie on launch, you blew it. 

Their biggest problem is that their core business is still linear TV and that market is collapsing quickly, so this deal would be an absolute massive gamble on nothing but the content. As bad as AT&T got burned on Warner I'm not sure there would be a buyer. Plus, a buyer would have to put up a massive antitrust breakup fee in case the deal got nixed by regulators.

45,NBA," platform-wise, yes there is definitely some growing to do for CBS and they joined the game waaay too late. Amazon has rights to NFL's thursday night football currently, but they were not actively seeking a partnership with the NFL. the way i saw this deal, the NFL set a price point that regular tv networks deemed too high purposely because they knew Amazon has the capital and wants to get their skin in the game or test the waters at least in addition to their marketing power.

one of the few leverages the traditional TV networks have are local team broadcasts. their infrastructure is already in place for this. this is where a lot of other streaming services lack. all the major sports networks that big streamers usually carry (NFL TV, NBA TV, MLB TV) blackout local games. while things like the super bowl are important to viewership, that is just icing on the cake to me. local viewership is just as important, especially when generational talent rolls around, for that consistent income. athletes nowadays are human billboards. coupled with talks that college athletes will be able to be paid/endorsed heating up. Patrick Mahomes, the next football prodigy in many people's eyes, has singlehandedly increased viewership/interest by leaps and bounds. traditional tv networks are able to show these guys more regularly with local viewership + just being able to show more national games in general rather than the once a week 1 match up thursday night football. CBS in particular also has a long list of sportscasters that have been around for decades and they can sway viewership also, albeit on a much smaller scale. your average sports fan is going to pick the service where we can see our teams more often rather than just the ""big games"". these people are loyal and will go where ever their team goes. CBS already includes local sports as a streaming option, not sure about the others.

this is territory where it gets tricky for big streamers because of the (for lack of a better term) ""cyclical"" nature of sports, both season and draw appeal of the athletes. unless big streamers acquired a traditional tv network or became a network themselves, they would likely have to work something out with their competitors. it'd be too much of a risk to ride only on the big games because the outcome of a sporting event can tank viewership/ratings in the blink of an eye as what it was with the most recent super bowl. i wouldn't put it passed a company like amazon to do this with the way they've been going, but it seems like a hill that may be too difficult to climb.",sup__bruh,1,/r/stocks/comments/nlufsp/viacomcbs_surging_as_a_potential_buyout_target_in/gzo48pt/,0.039,0.851,0.111,0.9866

53,AJRD," I would recommend investing in AEROJET ROCKETDYNE (AJRD).

61,AI," A alien that can travel to our planet will have vastly superior transportation capability. The good news is that their existence would prove that there is, indeed, a much faster way to travel. Whether that is folding space or some more rudimentary means doesn't matter. If we know that its possible, we will start researching them all. So what you want are companies involved in futuristic physics research. Id look at quantum computing companies and anyone capable of creating a behavioral AI (we will likely drop all regulation and moral objections at that point) or who has close ties to government funding like defense contractors.

Forget conventional weapons. Our weapons will be near useless except maybe high powered lasers which are not economical at long range (except in space maybe) and extremely dangerous due to power input/output. 

In terms of weapons, our greatest weapon will be biological. Aliens will likely die if exposed to our biome. They did not evolve around our micro organisms like we did, so odds are, those will either kill them or their micro organisms will kill us or maybe even both.

93,AMZN," I bought back into a double-sized position of Amazon on the first dip after Jassy was named the successor.  

Bezos, for all the hype he gets, has been largely disengaged from Amazon the company for many years now.  Long story short, used to be heavily involved with an Amazon-related business many, many years ago.  Significant enough to be dealing with the ring around Bezos himself.  Noticed a huge change in what had been a constructive relationship.  He became a figure in name only.  Can't blame him, as I'd also check out too, and at much lower levels of personal wealth.  The point here is that losing Bezos isn't really the loss the media made it out to be.  He's been gone for a long time.

Second is that I've observed in a lot of highly successful enterprises, there's some unheralded person or people that have and drive the most awesome ideas, if the leadership allows.  The point here is that most of the brilliant strategies and execution of the last couple decades, that behind the scenes genius has been Jassy.  And again, contrary to initial media reports, him being named was very good news, not bad or unknowable.

Everyone holding gets to experience the juicy unrealized gains, but only a fraction of folks actually realize notable gains. The peak never lasts and it often doesn't take long to go from being rich to bleeding cash. I like the digital cash because while it's a lot more volatile, I have faith in it rising overall in the future so it's fine for me to not constantly watch it. With these stocks, anything can happen and their price isn't being driven by long term fundamentals (for the most part) but pressure against shorting.

250,ATH," Gold is not a good hedge against inflation for a number of reasons:

1. When inflation happens, interest rates rise. Rising interest rates are bad for precious metals because investors flock to assets with yields.

2. Gold prices have already increased in anticipation of inflation. Gold prices are already up about 20% since the start of the pandemic. Much of the returns from precious metals are driven by changing investor sentiment rather than tracking inflation. Declining interest rates cause inflation fears, which drive up prices before inflation even happens. By the time inflation happens and rates go up, gold prices decline. Just look at what happened to gold/silver prices after the GFC. Hit an ATH of about $183 in 2011 due to inflation panic, then crashed down to just over $100 in 2015, and never fully recovered until last summer when money printing fears resurfaced.",skilliard7,1,/r/stocks/comments/nmdr3z/protect_against_inflation_and_raising_interest/gzohr3m/,0.089,0.774,0.137,0.7264

257,AMC," Hey! Let me try and answer some of your questions - 
1. AMC - hey, a lot of people got in on investing with GME and AMC, so don’t sweat it. However know that those are very rare events and are not likely to happen again. Your learning should be that don’t invest in hype / meme stocks. Start with ETFs (VTI, QQQ etc.). Invest in companies that you believe in. This has been repeated multiple times - Time in the Market beats Timing the Market. What that means is that play the long game, hold stocks long term and react based on how those companies are performing. 

2. Taxes / Short term vs. Long term gains - Any profit you realize will be taxed. So if you buy a stock and sell for profit - the profit is taxed. How much it is taxed depends on how long you have held your position. If you hold for longer than a year, you fall into long term capital gains tax, which is lower than short term capital gains which is taxed as ordinary income. The profit will be taxable irrespective. Even if you invest it somewhere else, you are taxed on the profit you made from the sale.

3. 401K and Roth IRA are tax advantaged retirement schemes. You can’t transfer stocks from your brokerage to your retirement fund. However, you can use your 401K/IRA funds to invest in different portfolios. I would suggest not to gamble with your retirement money. Choose a risk profile depending on your age / appetite and let that money compound and grow. Use extra money to invest in individual stocks. 

4. You will have a different account for each service - A Vanguard Brokerage account, a Roth IRA account, 401K etc. They are different from each other and not part of the same pool of money. 

5. I am not sure about funding a Roth IRA using 401K. They are quite different. For your 401K, you are deducted pre tax, but are taxed when you get the money back at retirement. For Roth IRA - you contribute post tax money, however, when you withdraw at retirement, you don’t pay any tax.

275,AAPL," So, there's a common misconception for a number of investors between *risk* and *volatility*. Volatility refers purely to price action - how dispersed prices are around the mean. Volatility really just gives you a frame of reference for the typical distribution profile of some investment. Risk, on the other hand, is the chance that an event has an effect on the investment thesis. This can include known risks (regulatory risk, which materialized with BABA as legal harassment from the CCP) and unknown risks (like with early stage companies, where there is an indefinite number of things that can go wrong leading up to profitability). 

 Not investment advice, but major things I'd look at here in terms of risk: 

1. The distinction between the Momentum Index and the Momentum Tilt index. Make sure you know which one you want - the former is riskier by virtue of being less diversified. 
2. What's in the rest of your portfolio? One thing to be careful of with factor ETFs is that many can have you unknowingly over-exposed to the same particular companies. For instance, if your other holdings (even if ETFs) are heavily weighted to AMZN, TSLA, MSFT and AAPL you're going to be adding idiosyncratic exposure to these companies by virtue of the fact that they are ""high momentum"" currently. Look at the sector/ region exposure while you're at it. 
3. The biggest thing that worries me about this is the ad-hoc rebalancing criteria. The index rebalances twice a year (quite infrequent, in the scheme of things) and has an ad-hoc rebalancing criteria that seeks volatility above the 95th percentile of index history. I would do a little work in a spreadsheet to find out what this means in practice, because you may wind up about 6 months behind major market regime shifts.

280,ABC," I think this example is getting lost in trying to explain it with a single asset.

The best way to look at investment is that your money at any given time could be doing one of a million things, and you are choosing which is the best possible thing it could be doing right now.

So it's more like this:

Bought ABC at $10 a while back, can sell for $30 now. Why are you selling -> seems it's going to go down from now so sell high.

Fine then, sell. Now it's cash. Is it cash for long? Are you going to wait for it to get to $20? No. It's getting invested into YYY that is currently at $10 and you think it will become $30.

Fast forward, now ABC is $20 again, and YYY is $30. Do you sell YYY to buy ABC? No, because ABC will only get to $30, but YYY is slated to get to $50 in the same time frame.

This is the same logic by which it makes sense to take a loss and sell at a bad stock time, if there's a better opportunity elsewhere.

Say you are all in YYY and it tanks overnight. You bought at $10 but it fell to $8. But ABC fell to $5 and you feel certain that ABC will climb back to $30 faster than YYY. Then sell YYY, take the loss, and get into ABC asap. Because of the million things your money could be doing right now, getting into ABC is the best thing you can see in this very moment, including taking the loss at YYY.

The past already happened, you can't change it by holding on to a bad position. The future begins now, if you are going to seize it, you need to reevaluate and find the best opportunity for now.

302,DDD," Take it and be glad you are not as stupid as I am. My profit on DDD is right now 74% and I am not gonna sell because the portfolio is a longterm run, but I am almost certain it will crash down very soon again. There was no real reason for the surge, in fact the opposite was the case.

But when you have the balls to sell, then be happy with the money you just made. You made it because of your decision and no one can take it. THE WORST THING you can do is sell and get back in after it keeps rising or starts falling. Both are amazing death traps to neutralize your previous profits.

Learned that lesson when I started, roughly 5 or 6 years ago. Back then I had 2k and made an amazing high risk trade that returned a profit of 12k after a single day, so I had 14k. Those were options on oil with a price of 0.02 (the lowest it can go) and I put in all of my money. A tweet from the previous president made that happen - but that contract didn't stop at 0.12 where I sold, it surged up to beyond 1.50. Just to realize how much I missed out, I could have made 75 times of what I put in, or 2000x75=150000€ just after starting with 2k. So what happened afterwards? I went for the next one at 0.02 and put in 2k again. This time it went down. And it went really far down. The broker started closing my positions because I was hitting the margin call and at that point I sold the rest. Luckily I still had 3.5k left, but that could have wiped out pretty much all of my account by being stupid as hell.",oodex,1,/r/stocks/comments/nmhjtl/profit_of_51today_why_do_i_feel_stupid/gzoq0wt/,0.112,0.754,0.134,0.7611

This company has amazing potential. 

As a lot of people are confused about r/m's. What happens is a publicly traded company dies. They essentially abandon being the ticker by going bankrupt or just closing up shop. Someone comes in and cleans up issues the ticker has. Then a company that wants to go public buys the shell and moves their company in. Not bullshitting and saying these are 0 risk plays.

316,LEAF," Think of it this way. Stock is ownership. 

You have a lemonade stand. It’s a successful one, as far as neighborhood lemonade stands go. You own 100%, which means that you own 100% of the equity. In the beginning, let’s say you could sell your family lemonade recipe for $100, you own some equipment worth a few grand, and you pull in a couple thousand every quarter. You want to expand, but that requires funding. You need a million dollars to buy the equipment, pay employees, purchase real estate for your stores, etc. But what do you have to offer someone who can give you that funding? 

You can offer investors $1 for every lemonade sold. That’s a royalty deal. Or you can offer them a percentage of your company. Let’s say you convince two investors your lemonade business will be a huge success. They agree to pony up $500,000 each for 25% of your company. In real life, they’d probably want riders attached to that money to reduce their risk, and board seats, but let’s keep it simple. Right now, by investing that money, they’re saying your company is worth $2,000,000 if you sold the company—yes the entire company—to a willing buyer (actually, they’re hoping someone will pay a lot more). That’s right—when someone wants to buy your lemonade company, you’re not handing them bags of lemons when they write you a check. What you hand them is your company stock. (Better be some good lemonade!)

Now you all could be wrong. The lemonade company can fail and be worth zero. No one would want to buy it. 

On the flip side though, If your lemonade is a big success, people will want to buy your company for considerably more than $2,000,000. Heck, you might earn $2,000,000 just in lemonade sales a year, in addition to the value of your equipment and real estate. Now, you could take an offer from the private equity firm that wants to give you $5,000,000 to walk away, but your original investors think people will pay a whole lot more. That’s when these investors say, hey man, you should IPO, raise more money for growth (and for our profitable exit). 

Lemonade is hot right now. So everyone wants in. The IPO values you at $20,000,000, based on your book value, your earnings, and what some folks think you can pull in over the next few years. If someone wants to come along and buy your company outright (all its stock), that’s what they’ll need to pay. Suddenly, the stock held by your original investors (assuming no dilution, keeping it simple) is worth $5,000,000. They can sell off some equity and make a nice profit. 

Those who buy in at the IPO price are making the same calculation those original investors did. That your company will grow and become more valuable to those who want to buy or control it. For a retail investor buying a small amount of stock, they’ll never get a board seat, they’ll never have a prayer of owning a significant part of the company and exerting control... but the whales, the institutional investors and large investment banks absolutely will. They’ll be paying more per share for the privilege of controlling the company via board seats or activism, and may even bid to takeover the company outright. In the belief that they can drive even more growth and value, and make your lemonade company even more valuable to future buyers. 

When you finally sell to PepsiCo for $40,000,000, the stock those IPO holders bought is worth double. The stock those original investors held? Well, let’s just say they cash out feeling very happy for themselves. 

Upon the sale of the company, there can be a few different outcomes for investors, but a cash for stock deal is one that might make the most sense to you. In that scenario, you get paid based on that $40,000,000 valuation. If you bought in much lower, you made a nice profit. 

Good example is LEAF. Worth $1 a share a year ago when the company was valued at around $37,000,000. Now the company sold to another company for $323 million. Shareholders will get $8.50 a share in cold hard cash. The company that bought LEAF isn’t paying $8.50 for air, they’re buying a company. Stock is the way the ownership transfers. 

To you, a Redditor who likely does not have a ton of equity in any company, of course stock seems inherently worthless. You will never own the company. You will never control it. You will never sell it or merge it or spin-off it’s parts or do anything to change the company’s value at all. But people far more wealthy and powerful than you will. And their intention is to always drive the fundamentals of a company to become more valuable so that part or all of it can be sold for more money. The democratic thing about stock investing is that whatever price they sell to each other for, that’s the price you can sell your stock for too.

Of course there are pumps and dumps, situations where stock values are inflated, wildly divorced from fundamentals and there’s no way the company will ever sell (or raise funds) at that price. In these cases, it’s really just gambling. But valuations tend to revert to a mean over time and represent true value. If you own stocks that are insanely overvalued (you know the ones), ideally you get out before the music stops.

In short, stock has value because it really does represent ownership. The profits a company makes that aren’t paid out in dividends are retained or reinvested in the company, and if handled responsibly, the company becomes more attractive to those who would want to buy it outright or own enough to exert influence. Ownership is power. Not for you, gentle Redditor, but for those at the top that trade the stock, it absolutely is. You just get to benefit by the money they’re willing to pay.",sokpuppet1,2,/r/stocks/comments/nlwxkg/why_exactly_are_stocks_valuable/gzlqry8/,0.039,0.785,0.176,0.9994
317,TSLA," It has nothing to do with the company. It has everything to do with the market.  

A share is the product - it represents part of the company that the company put on the market for some value at IPO or when the company issues shares.  Its sold initially by the company, but then sold by anyone in the market.

The market determines the price of the stock.  A stock’s value fluctuates often widely, but fundamentally is driven by supply and demand.  

Lets take TSLA for example - why is its price so high? Its due in large part from low supply compared to its demand. Its popular, and people in the market like to buy it because Elon Musk, the product, and because they innovate and may be growing.  As people buy it for more money, it causes the price to go up.  At some point, prices have to go down because all the people that bought it have it, and some will sell, but not everyone.  


Fundamentally though, that there is a market is why shares are worth money.  Without a way to trade, there is no value.",Tigersharktopusdrago,-1,/r/stocks/comments/nlwxkg/why_exactly_are_stocks_valuable/gzlde4t/,0.043,0.814,0.142,0.9618
318,USA," Money is not just speculative. Money is backed by the combined sum of all assets plus production in a country as well as their ability to defend said things. Thus when you have a US dollar, you have claim to a asset or service within the USA. It is literally a contract and it is backed by something real.

Stocks are also a contract. It grants you the right to assets and production of a company both current and future. In theory, if said assets were sold, you would get a cut equivalent to your contract stake. In many ways, the asset it worth more than the cash you can extract. 

So whats the point to all of it you say? First, its an efficient system (though not perfect) and, as harsh/unfair/tragic as this sounds, it keeps us entertained (think hamster wheel). Thats not to say there isnt good in the system. There is good if used correctly and in a moral way but alas, it takes just a handful of people to misuse it and the result is a lot of others get hurt. But thats true of all prior systems too. Actually old ones (like gold standard) were much worse and more easy to corrupt, which is why we moved away from them.",thejumpingsheep2,3,/r/stocks/comments/nlwxkg/why_exactly_are_stocks_valuable/gzmb5ic/,0.077,0.803,0.121,0.4562
