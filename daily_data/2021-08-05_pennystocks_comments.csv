0,TSLA," For me, I pumped $2000 into TSLA in 2019, right before their Annual General Meeting, knowing that they'd have some big news to share. In one year it grew about 150% and that was huge for me as a new investor, in fact I had even created a brokerage account just to buy TSLA. Might not be a penny, but right now I'm hoping to do the same with MBH Corp.",thelonelyteaparty,36,/r/pennystocks/comments/oy7va9/how_long_were_you_trading_before_you_hit_you/h7r995u/,0.0,0.88,0.12,0.7543

27,AMC," 6 months, flipped CTXR 1.8 -> 4

I don’t count AMC but if we are, 250%. It was my first ever “swing trade”, and I only bought like, 5 shares at $4.6 and sold at 16. I never realized how insane 250% in one day was until I got more experienced.

So far I’ve only taken one loss in my year of swing trading, Sold NVAX for a 10% loss after EUA delay. Bought at 150, sold at 120ish (don’t remember exact numbers) If I had held, it’s gone well over 220 now. Lesson learned.

A word of advice, don’t try to day trade. It’s gambling. Pick a stock you have a strong conviction with, and hold for a couple months to a year through the thick and thin. Swinging/long term holders always prevail.

30,AMC," Big is relative, if you're referring to % gain then it depends on your strategy and on the market / company. Personal experience from the early 2010s, I made some poor choices and turned a 79% loss. I followed the HODL strategy and saw a recovery climb to 35% loss followed by another drop. It took me about 8 years to turn a HODL strategy into a 20% gain.

Read that again, 20% over 8 years...I would have probably been better off with bonds! This year's meme stocks are helping my portfolio but an index fund like SP500 (SPY/VOO) would have netted me a return of 115% gain in that time frame (2.15x my investment). Today I'm up 56% since the initial investment, so picking stocks is a gamble. Sometimes you can do really well (my AMC at $9 per share) or not so we'll (picking a pharma stock at $19 per share that tanked).

TLDR:  this is not financial advice, but for me it would have been a better rate of return to invest majority in SPY and play with a smaller amount in more aggressive penny stocks. Stocks aren't a 50/50 coin toss, so you're more likely to lose than gain if you're shooting in the dark",TheWulfOfWullstreet,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/oy7va9/how_long_were_you_trading_before_you_hit_you/h7tht5t/,0.059,0.79,0.151,0.9696

Overall I try and do 10-20 different stocks a week with usually 1-3 positions each. 

So I might sell a CC for CLF, as an example, and then set a gtc limit sell order immediately after. At times I can sell and then buy to close an option in minutes, so then I sell another the same day. Other times it may take a few days before my limit sale price is reached. So that’s maybe 20-60 positions a week and I’ll close for 50% profit usually.",Umaynotknowme,2,/r/pennystocks/comments/oy7va9/how_long_were_you_trading_before_you_hit_you/h7u2uay/,0.0,0.956,0.044,0.6652
48,CC," Again, that depends on whether I’m doing options or pennies. If I can do a CC for $2 premium and set a gtc sell at 50% then I will clear around $100 on that trade. In that case I would sell two contracts for a $200 profit and hope to close that position sooner rather than later. I’ve had it close in minutes, but usually it is a few hours to a few days before it closes. Then I can start that one over again. 

If I’m doing pennies then I usually buy in blocks of $500 and am looking for a total return of 30-40%. If I’m very bullish on a penny I’ll look for 40+% and if only slightly bullish I’ll go closer to 30%.

Ultimately, their pipeline of products plus their leadership are the reasons CTXR will do well.  
More details... Their Mino-Lok product is filling an unmet need. It's near the end of their phase 3 trial. Citius will submit their New Drug Application early 2022. It has fast track status that will shave some time off of the review process. Everything so far with Mino-Lok is pointing to a significant improvement over current state of care for infected catheter lines, at a reduced cost to hospitals and insurance. And there have been no concerns around safety or futility during any of the trials. And the product has literally saved people's lives. Assuming it makes it to market, it should make the company worth a minimum of 4x to 8x what the company's market cap is right now.  
They also have a product in the works for reducing infections after breast augmentation surgeries, another one for hemorrhoids (currently there are no prescriptions for hemorrhoids; theirs would be the first), and one for some Covid-related things.  
I'm not saying this'll moon or be squeezed, but it should inch up toward the end of this phase 3 trial (expected to be EOY or Q1 2022), then would pop on subsequent FDA approvals, distribution announcements, etc. And the hemorrhoid cream could have an announcement any day (but that is me speculating). So yeah, I do expect this company to do well in the mid-term and very very well in the long term (talking like 3, 5, maybe 10 years).
