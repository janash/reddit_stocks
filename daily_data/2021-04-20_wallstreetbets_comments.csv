https://imgur.com/a/SloplAX

It's approximately 19.42% of the float today, 21.07% on Friday with 33M out of 157M shares available...

Someone is banking that the company doesn't complete, or even updated shareholders on their solid state MEMS based [long range lidar](https://youtu.be/XwiI1-rSgq0) which is based off of the [light engine which can be found in the Hololens 2](https://charts.stocktwits.com/production/original_318277355.jpg). 

That same light engine that allows Microsoft to reach the unheard of [80degx40deg](https://preview.redd.it/hzfka1myslr61.png?width=1024&auto=webp&s=4fe042837ace63723d47fbf3ca876de5588149f7) Field of View in their IVAS (Integrated Visual Augmentation Headsets) which recently won a [$21.88 Billion dollar contract](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/31/microsoft-wins-contract-to-make-modified-hololens-for-us-army.html) from the US Army, for the next 10 years.

The entire LIDAR sector has seen a focused short attack, but the one difference is that Microvision is seeing an unusual amount of darkpool activity as seen on [stockgrid.io](https://www.stockgrid.io/darkpools/MVIS) which is showing a $309M dollar buy-side imbalance from the last 20 days. 

The shorts Cramer was talking about was also [Hindenberg Research](https://twitter.com/HindenburgRes/status/1341403669162565638) which shorted the stock at $9... where it dropped to $5 then squeezed up to $24. 

I even made a video meme back in January while it was being shorted as Hindenberg has their shitty patent lawyer try to shit talk Microvision's 480+ patents which they've accumulated over the past 20 years in business... only to delete all his tweets on twitter.

[Hindenberg's Downfall](https://streamable.com/elfn5o)

Good luck to all longs...

77,AR," This is actually one of those rare instances where it‚Äôs a good stock and there‚Äôs an opportunity for a short squeeze. The CEO indicated in March that they are pursuing a buyout or strategic partnership for both their Lidar and AR verticals. Yes, their revenue sucks, and that‚Äôs probably why shorts see it as an easy target, but that‚Äôs not how the company should be valued. They have best in class Lidar that is going to be available in 2021, not 2023 and beyond. With companies scrambling to dominate the self driving and AR markets, this is an incredible opportunity for a buyout. Combine that with several Google and Ford affiliated execs joining the board in recent months and you can‚Äôt help but try to connect the dots. Nothing is certain in this world, but this is a bet I‚Äôm willing to make.

You ride with this thing not making a mistake for a month in what appears to be the exact same situation every day, your not going to expect it to change.

IE you could be having lost satellites and GPS, and road marking 15 times on this straight but those 3 loses just haven't ever all 3 over lapped for long enough yet.  So if you failed to the last line of safety 100 times in that same stretch every day, only tesla can know that. The driver has no way of knowing how close the system came to failure, and how those 5 satellites normally seen overhead maybe only 2 are visible today due to different conditions. Yet through constant exposure most Tesla owners will begin to think of them selves as the experts in the system. Of course it doesn't help when you have Musk saying it is safer than a normal driver.

411,BB," BB and Cloudflare aren't comparable companies. They're both in cybersecurity but entirely different fields. Cloudflare deals with web infrastructure security, internet security, DDoS mitigation. BB is more IoT security, critical event management and UEM. They can't be comparably valued considered the products are vastly different.

A comparable company making security products in the same exact category (IoT, event management, UEM) is Cisco. Cisco trades at 4.67 P/S vs BBs 5.42 P/S. 

BB is also not a high-growth company comparable to Cloudflare which grows roughly 50%+ YoY, if you don't account for acquiring Cylance then BB revenue actually decreased in 2020 (again, like Cisco).

Blackberry QNX neutrino is a great product, and regarded a leader in autonomous vehicle OS, but it's **not** the only OS used by autonomous vehicle companies - most companies use several.

Not to mention the size of the market is tiny - globally the demand for AVs was 6700 units in 2020. 

[https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/autonomous-vehicles-market#:\~:text=The%20global%20autonomous%20vehicle%20market,innovation%20in%20the%20automotive%20industry](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/autonomous-vehicles-market#:~:text=The%20global%20autonomous%20vehicle%20market,innovation%20in%20the%20automotive%20industry).

Predicting the size of the AV market is essentially impossible, but it's widely regarded that it won't take off significantly until at least 2030, and that's plenty of time for a other OS's to be developed, or for other companies to battle for market share. Hell VW itself is creating their own OS.

BB has the **potential** to be a strong security player, but until it starts building out products in other areas like cloud security and web security, or showing off incredible growth figures, it's not going to be valued like Cloudflare, it'll sit at more comfortable valuations.

420,BB," Innovation is always expensive in the short term, so they haven't  made enough money while being perceived as a boomer phone company. Instead they are the only viable security and security ops software provider. At 5B market cap they are extremely cheap. While not completely alike look at other companies that already have an in with the governments and big business like Palantir, Oracle, IBM's market caps. It's not unrealistic for BB, at worst, to double to 10B.

The infrastructure spending will include security and there is no other option that has a long standing reputation or the right products to be a viable option for governments. Same kind of story for commercial companies. The threat of russian and chinese hackers isn't going to go away anytime soon. The thing with being a company like BB is that everybody is going to need them and once they sign the first contract it becomes very hard to switch to something else. This means even if others see the opportunity in the space and come up with competing products and reputation it'll be hard to steal the BlackBerry pie.

As BB you‚Äôre gonna struggle when you have serious issues retaining talent, shaking your not so shiny rep, and nobody in the city really wants to work for you; especially when there are enough tech jobs to go around.

448,BB," Seriously. Have any of you even bothered to look at where it's been trading for the last *9 years*? You honestly think it's been under some secret attack from Wall Street for 9 years and during all that time they didn't announce contracts that they had won, yet still kept the price where it was at? It's because their revenue has been garbage all along and announcing new contracts doesn't mean old ones didn't expire and weren't renewed, meaning the announcements were just a wash.

The biggest announcement they've had recently has been their partnership with Amazon back in December. At that time it went from \~$5.60 to \~$8.30, which is where it's back at now. It only rocketed higher for those few days at the end of January because of the meme train. *Nothing else.* There has been no news of any actual consequence since then. All the other announcements have been small and some just a repackage of already existing expiring contracts that maintain their current unprofitable revenue. If you want to go really long, that's fine, but it's going to depend on what they actually produce with the Amazon partnership and that's still a *long* ways out.

473,BB," Agree, the revenue and earnings numbers look to explain a lot of this. While many companies saw greater revenue in Q1 2021, BB saw reduced revenue \*and\* spent a lot more money which reduced their earnings substantially. Perhaps those spent dollars were investments by BB to open up new revenue streams, but it takes time for that to translate to new revenue and more time to show proof it's substantial and sustained. 

Why invest now in a company that is searching for a bottom when that money could be put elsewhere? Why not give BB time to prove out their new revenue streams, invest in them later when the price is better and the news more likely to be solid. I suspect many buyers would be wondering that, which translates to fewer buyers. Current holders may be wondering the same and simply looking to re-enter at a better price or when their is better evidence there will be upwards movement.

554,GM," Sorry to offend you with my added opinion.  You can call them undervalued,  but every new tech company isn't automatically worth 1 trillion dollars. The trillion dollar club will require sales,  not just future hype. Eventually the earnings are going to need to support the price.

I think your putting a value on the fsd that isn't going to translate to real dollars and cents in profit. New ideas don't necessarily mean massive earnings just because the technology is cool.  If your thinking robotaxi income, you can't automatically put tesla as the winner there.  GM owns cruise who is already also working on this and struck an exclusive deal in Dubai.

562,FSD," I have provided facts multiple times and you just re-posted the two links I shared while simultaneously pretending I haven‚Äôt provided facts, but here is even more explanation...

Tesla needs to say it‚Äôs not autonomous yet for liability protection; this is pretty obvious so I‚Äôm surprised it has to be explained. Once they are fully autonomous and Tesla Insurance has rolled out more fully then they would be able to take on the liability of driving autonomously. Until then it needs to be the driver‚Äôs responsibility and they still need help ironing out bugs. 

It‚Äôs a beta version which is why it‚Äôs ‚Äúnot currently‚Äù autonomous from a regulatory perspective (I‚Äôve explained this several times now to multiple people in the above comments). There is very little framework for the rolling out of autonomous vehicles on a nationwide basis since it‚Äôs new tech so Tesla has developed their own approach starting with an ever-increasing ‚Äúbeta‚Äù version that will roll out more broadly over time. 

There are videos all over YouTube showing many beta drivers going through many difficult situations autonomously at Level 4 (driver oversight since it‚Äôs still beta and for liability protection). Here are a few recent ones:

https://youtu.be/j570J8nUep8

https://youtu.be/Hp2SB5FZG24

https://youtu.be/rKG3eDppzm4

I‚Äôm shocked how hard it seems to be for people to understand that you need to roll this out over time. You act like they should be able to launch a fully autonomous robo-taxi without collecting any data from public driving conditions. No one is rolling out autonomous driving this way since it‚Äòs not possible nor would it be safe to roll out broadly right from the start. 

Waymo and Cruise have paid engineers to oversee this training. Tesla has used ‚Äúshadow mode‚Äù in their fleet of cars sold to customers and then now has allowed a subset of FSD purchasers to continue the training more directly.

567,FSD," Yes, I mentioned I used your link in my comment. My point was the only ""proof"" you've provided didn't agree with you. Level 4 or 5 requirements as per **your link** were not met.

Those videos also don't prove anything. It's anecdotal evidence - anecdotal evidence that doesn't even prove your point - 1 minute into the first video the driver adjusts the steering wheel. That at least instantly disqualifies it from Level 5, and tbh considering there was no input from the vehicle disqualifies it from Level 4 (level 4 says human action may be required with the request of the vehicle).

You're mixing up two points that don't make sense - I am not disagreeing that you need a beta for training data. I am disagreeing that it is level 4 or level 5 autonomous driving - even Tesla itself has stated otherwise. 

Tesla have stated its Level 2: [https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a35785277/tesla-fsd-california-self-driving/#:\~:text=The%20correspondence%20between%20Tesla%20and,autonomous%20features%20to%20its%20vehicles](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a35785277/tesla-fsd-california-self-driving/#:~:text=The%20correspondence%20between%20Tesla%20and,autonomous%20features%20to%20its%20vehicles).

Liability and the tech are the exact same problem; if the tech was actually level 5 autonomous, why would they care about the liability? It should drive better than any human. 

Not to mention Tesla FSD beta drivers have mentioned they sign a liability waiver..

However, it definitely has the makings of a short play. High short interest, low delta options with lots of OI, and someone has been accumulating shares. It also has a possible huge catalyst on 5/20, with earnings coming out. 

Looking into that more, they only need to make about 5% margin on premiums versus claims to cut their losses in half and get 9-12 months of runway. That would be a huge catalyst. I think it's entirely possible for them to pull that off with covid calming more.

599,CLOV," *Puts on responsible hat*

Depends what your goal is. I've got my serious investments which i keep diversified, boring, and safe. 

Then I have play money that I toss at whatever amuses me. The idea behind CLOV is that some people might be shorting it excessively, meaning that it could be an investment opportunity if the short blows up on them. some people here are speculating it could go up instead. Who's right? No idea, but it amuses me to toss some money at it. If I'm wrong, oh well. I've lost more money in Vegas. 

Never put more money that you're willing to lose in one spot. 

To put it another way, anything here is free advice. Free adice is generally over priced.

Of course, during a squeeze the price rises so dramatically that a sudden drop gives the impression ""this is over"" instead of just buying the dip like you would when AAPL dips on no news. So the attack can definitely work in theory for a GME or a CLOV, especially when there is so much on the line for the shorts.

I don't need a ""theory"" to explain a sideways moving market. It's genuinely not unnatural or unusual or unexpected for a security to have high volume and trade sideways. It's entirely legit for the market to battle and argue over the value of something and have it trade within a range.

And it's not like it was perfectly flat. It swung between 9.17 and 10.57, just because *you* think it should go a certain way, or don't like it when it goes up and then people take profits doesn't mean it's a conspiracy.

Volume greater than float also isn't that meaningful, it just indicates volatility and uncertainty and enthusiasm for the security. Day traders and swing traders love shit like that and help drive it.

619,AON," Still doesn't matter. AON, IOC, and FOK are available to (some) retail traders. I can place FOK on etrade for example. Those orders are still subjected to the order book.

A FOK order for example will try to chew through the order book, and it doesn't matter if it's for 9.99 or 9.7346, there are thousands of other market participants constantly submitting orders to the book for 10's and 100's of thousands of shares worth of volume. It might get killed, or might get filled, but you have absolutely no control over whose corresponding orders are used to fill yours.

If you set a FOK for 10k shares at 9.9123, it will consume as many shares at qualifying prices from as many submitted orders as needed in a first come first serve basis. Anything anybody has submitted that is siting in the book will be used up.

HFT can see the book too, so they can jump in in less than a microsecond to poach while the order is alive for however many seconds. To algorithms a FOK is an eternity. It's not just time of submission that matters, but price.

686,CLOV," So... to me it sounds like he's mixing up a bunch of concepts and not really getting the details right.

Delta hedging: When a market maker sells you a call contract they have to hedge that contract by buying shares so that if you decide to exercise that contract they have the shares ready to sell you without losing any money in the trade. Market Makers strictly make their profit by making a few pennies off the difference between the bid and ask price, but they don't gamble stonks the way degenerate apes like you and I do. 1 call contract = 100 shares, HOWEVER they will only hedge 100 shares \* the current delta value for that contract. A contract that is exactly in the money (i.e. $15 strike price and the stock is currently trading for $15) will have exactly .5 delta so 100 shares \* .5 delta = the MM has to purchase 50 shares to be hedged.  The delta on calls that are at the money moves the most quickly (this means they have very high gamma), so going up one dollar from $15 to $16 will have a huge effect on the amount that needs to be hedged versus if the stock goes from $18 to $19 (and the strike price is still only $15). Stocks that are deep in the money will have a delta of 1 and so 1 call = 100 stonks.

None of this has anything to do with Open Interest, as far as I know. Open interest is how many contracts are currently owned (and therefore active) by people or institutions. You can see the May contracts for Clov are [HEAVILY](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CLOV/options?p=CLOV) slanted towards OTM calls which could cause a gamma squeeze. This is part of what caused GME to explode, but one difference here is that Clov only trades monthly options whereas GME trades weekly options. I'm honestly not sure how contracts with expirations that are weeks away will effect a potential gamma squeeze, but it's something to be aware of.",TOTALLYnattyAF,8,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mubopi/clovposition_day2_i_juggled_this_morning_added/gv69gqm/,0.017,0.862,0.121,0.987

720,CVS," There‚Äôs no way he‚Äôs acquitted. 

At the very least he will be guilty on the second degree manslaughter charge. 

Even with a guilty verdict on that charge it won‚Äôt be enough for the folks that never planned to ‚Äúprotest peacefully‚Äù from the start. Some activists have already said cities will burn. Your theory on CVS has high probability. There‚Äôs a number of companies that may be in the same boat. Could be worth a deeper dive. 

Also, there‚Äôs no way this jury deliberates for a whole month. They‚Äôve already had the case for two days. My bet is they have a verdict by next Friday. 

We have another highly volatile trial coming up in Atlanta for the Rayshard Brooks case, as well. It will get ugly here, too. Honestly, it‚Äôs been ugly here since those infamous protests last summer. 

Hopefully we will have new moon addresses before it goes down.

For $150k you can buy ~957 shares of GME. If it drops another $7 tomorrow (which is far from unreasonable based on the last 2 days), that wipes out $6699 in value in a DAY. If he sold 9 $160 4/23 CC's at $9 a piece (closed the day at 8.48 down 36% on the day) that's only $8100 in profit against $6699 in losses.

Meanwhile, buying that much in UWMC right near its all time low with earnings coming up in a few weeks and a strong dividend ($2058.6 on the number of shares) AND plenty of room to grow?

868,PLTR," You're neglecting the fact that they just entered the commercial market recently, have been investing heavily in sales and marketing with multiple demo events to capture more and more interest from companies. As big data is becoming more and more prevalent and PLTR's products are, evidently and confirmed even by the military, best-in-class, this provides a huge potential going forward. I think their financial estimations were somewhat on the conservative side, given the uncertainty of the pandemic, but with the products that they have, it would be fairly easy to land some huge contracts with the biggest companies or even governmental organizations.

It's hard to valuate companies with disruptive technologies using the traditional methods of valuation.

948,BB," Where did you read that? Wasn't that only deferred income in form of 12k shares, that he sold during the squeeze in January? That would be nothing, because iirc the rest of his shares were performance-restricted. I'm just curious, not trying to preach anything here.

Edit: So I looked it up and yes, the execs sold shares. According to [Reuters](https://mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN29Y1S8) it was during the run-up in January at around 12.60-13$. Three execs sold a combined 1.7 million $ worth of shares. That's like 130k shares at 13$, so it's not really worth mentioning. If anything, it tells us that they thought BB was overvalued during the squeeze, but who didn't know that.

1096,ALL," Lumber prices have increased close to 30% maybe more because covid shut production down but construction was still rolling (building took a small break but was deemed essential so the layoff wasn't nearly as long as restaurants, or personal care) So all lumber mils are behind on supply. Demand is way up, supply is down, basic economics says to raise the price of goods to slow demand. But demand is not slowing down! 

ALL LUMBER PRICES HAVE GONE UP! and I'd imagine that's nation wide.  The cost of all goods and service will or have go up.

1139,PTON," The Consumer Product Safety Commission video of the recent PTON treadmill accident is brutal.  
  
The child is fine, just terrified. Most treadmills have a ""pressure"" sensor that will stop turning when it feels too much resistance. With the PTON tread sitting a few inches higher and what looks like no ""pressure"" sensor, the treadmill will just pull harder and increase torque when it feels resistance.

There is no reason imo to continue shorting a stock when it has lost over 50% of its value and is in the single digits. At that point, you have very limited profit potential and massive loss potential.

I'm a little wary of earnings because every stock I held through earnings last quarter just got hammered, even on good news (IMMR, TGT, and CVS). I was especially bitter about TGT given that it reached new all-time highs like a couple of weeks after my calls expired. Lol.

1273,UI," Lol fuck that. Their business model isn't sustainable at all.

1. Wish is absolute garbage, what they sell is 99% junk.
2. UI is awful in both web and app, good luck finding anything specific. I've browsed them for a couple of years now and there's been no notable improvements. They also do that fucking annoying thing where they will post a cheap selection on the product you're looking for, and when you select what you searched for, the price goes up. Impossible to shop based on price.
3. Anyone who has purchased from Wish knows their products are incredibly low quality. Sure you get it for peanuts, but when you consider most items you buy off there will be a waste. If anything that puts people off from buying knockoffs, I doubt more than 5% of their first time buyers return. 
4. Scam tactics. Most of the products listed are nothing like the photos, and they know it. They know people aren't going to shell out x10 what they spent on it to return them, so it's pretty much a ""order at your own risk"" transaction
5. Customer service is rubbish, I ordered some random shit a couple of months ago for lols and didn't get like 2/6 items. I opened a customer service dispute and never heard back from them. Again, likely just expect people to not give a shit because the money spent isn't worth the effort.

If you want a dubious Chinese company that may actually make you some money, even Luckin Coffee is a better alternative than this dumpster fire.",InSilenceLikeLasagna,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/muue0f/dont_buy_that_knockoff_crap_on_wish_just_buy_wish/gv8wo4s/,0.177,0.747,0.076,-0.9853
1274,ARNC," Couple points to add
1) there has been lots of insider buying of ARNC. 
2) ARNC non compete for packaging materials is  ending next year. This is a nice potential additional revenue stream as beverage companies move away from plastics towards aluminum packaging. 

Short term risk is ARNC provides aluminum for Ford F-150. Any shutdown to production at Ford may hurt ARNC.",miles_crotch,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/muopy1/arnc_is_undervalued/gv7nms9/,0.083,0.875,0.042,-0.4019

1280,BIG," Taking a look at the company's web page, it looks like they plan to sell really ugly electric vehicles, but have nothing ready for market.

This is not how short volume works. Look at two weeks of short volume for any stock including ones you know are not accumulating short interest.
