24,UBS," The CS-UBS deal has raised concerns among some observers, who find it ""fishy"" for several reasons:

1.) Timing: The deal was announced on a Sunday night after a week of turmoil for Credit Suisse. The timing could be seen as an attempt to minimize market disruptions or as an indication that the situation was urgent.

2.) Government involvement: The Swiss government's decision to back the deal by waiving some laws and providing guarantees could be interpreted as an indication of the severity of the situation or as undue government interference in the financial sector.

3.) Impact on stakeholders: Some bondholders were wiped out, while shareholders received a low price for their shares, which may suggest that the deal was rushed or not in the best interests of all parties involved.

On the other hand, there are several arguments in favor of the deal:

1.) Avoiding a broader financial crisis: Some analysts argue that the deal was necessary to prevent a more significant financial crisis, which could have had far-reaching consequences for the global economy.

2.) Creating a wealth management powerhouse: The combined entity will have $5 trillion of client assets, making it a formidable competitor in the wealth management space.

3.) Retaining profitable divisions: UBS plans to keep the profitable parts of Credit Suisse's investment bank and Swiss unit, while unwinding most of its market positions. This could be a strategic move to strengthen the new entity while minimizing risk.

The CS-UBS deal has raised eyebrows and sparked debate.  The deal's ultimate success and long-term implications will depend on factors such as the integration of the two banks, the regulatory environment, and the overall health of the global economy.",GreatGatsby00,0,/r/stocks/comments/11w7wq2/does_the_csubs_deal_smell_fishy_to_anyone_else/jcy6h49/,0.089,0.768,0.143,0.9173

Foreign currency positions - literally on the [very first page of their annual report](https://www.snb.ch/en/mmr/reference/pre_20230306/source/pre_20230306.en.pdf)

>Why did SNB lend Credit Suisse $54 Billion when it's market cap was only $7 Billion?

Because market cap only captures total equity value, and doesn't capture full enterprise value (net debt) - market cap has nothing to do with solvency or a banks ability to continue as a going concern.

Maybe you're thinking that the $54bn in debt was collateralized by CS common shares? Spoiler alert: no way in fuck that would ever happen.

Plus, SNB = lender of last resort. That's sort of their job - to backstop the two major financial institutions that've been the backbone of the Swiss banking industry for centuries?

>Why did the price paid by UBS keep changing from $1B to $2B to 3B and finally $3.2B?

Because purchase price will change over the course of negotiations? Ever bought a used car? It's just like that

>Why were all Credit Suisse shareholders wiped out? It's market cap was 6.91 Billion on 3/17/23

Because UBS is buying CS in a stock-for-stock deal.

58,CS," If you are in charge of a bank, and there is a run on some other bank, and your bank is fine, you might be tempted to put out a public statement saying “ah, see, that bank was bad, so there was a run, but our bank is good and has no exposure to that bank, so there is no need for a run on us.” 

Sometimes that is right, the bad bank was idiosyncratically insolvent, and you should just avoid it. But long experience teaches that it’s often wrong. The right statement is often “hey everyone, that bank is great, there is no reason for a run, and in fact we are increasing our exposure to that bank, because we are strong and also because we are confident in that bank.” You run toward the fire, because that’s the only way to put it out.

So sounds like gov has the power to change the order but bondholders didn't expect that would happen. This is why after the GM bond write down in 2009 I stayed away from bonds. They're not even worth the paper the bonds are written on.

I'm also bagholding others including UPST (-68%) and ZIM (-53%) which I'm not sure if I should just cut loose or hold and hope for better days (these were by far my worst picks at the valuations they were at).

Just wondering out loud trying to figure out my exit strategies at this point...tempted to just cut loose all the tickers I listed above at Monday open (together they make up about 10% of my overall portfolio). I'm not really trying to time the market, I just want more peace of mind by putting that money into index funds instead (though I'd likely DCA the proceeds over the next several months given the current market volatility). 

However, of the stocks I listed above, I'm most inclined to keep AMD, CRM, and TTD.... AMD because I respect Lisa Su and think they'll continue taking market share from Intel and compete with NVDA for the foreseeable future, CRM because I think with all those activist investors and Marc Benioff returning as CEO the company is hyper focused on increasing profitability, and TTD because despite their lofty valuation they have a massive TAM and are destroying earnings every quarter with significant tailwinds once we get past this bearish cycle.

134,TTD," Sorry in advance for this long comment but just need to get my thoughts out there. Decided I want to reduce my portfolio allocation to individual stocks and reinvest the proceeds back into index funds. I got serious about investing at the end of 2021 (great timing I know) and while I still want to devote a small portion of my portfolio to stock picks, I admit I got carried away early on and ended up holding about 35 different companies at one point. I've trimmed that down to 28 now, but I'm still wasting too much time stressing over earnings calls and company-specific risks. Currently I have about 40% of my portfolio in individual stocks but I'd like to cut that down to 20-25% by the end of this year, though I'll hold certain positions longer if I can avoid realizing losses or paying unnecessary taxes.

165,GL," Just want to say I can sympathize with the anxiety.  Holding individual names right now is kind of nerve-wracking because you don't know who exactly is gonna end up getting hit.  At least with the index if things go down, well, they just go down, it's out of your hands.  

Haven't sold anything though yet, and I'm holding some financials (most of the anxiety for me right now is there, obviously).  Despite my anxiety, and despite holding some financials, I still feel like I'm well-positioned.  My portfolio was purposely designed to be resilient.

No particular advice on your situation.  What I would say is that in my experience it's important to create a solid plan and stick to it.  This is why I have not sold anything.  When I first started investing, also in 2021, I was buying and selling like crazy because I didn't really have a clear plan.  Finally got figured something out and despite the anxiety during this time I feel like I can remain confident in what I prepared for myself.

If a stock is at fair value, by definition it's not undervalued.

The biggest issue I've seen with US investors is projecting their own beliefs onto China, and then being puzzled when their Chinese positions don't move they way they expect.  If you understand the Common Prosperity initiative, the downward movement in BABA makes perfect sense. If you understand their government, you understand why when Jack Ma called them incompetent, BABA suffered sanctions. Elon Musk can say whatever he wants about the US government or the SEC. In China that would not fly.

230,BABA," My expectations were that BABA's earnings growth would slow down/stop and that the PE ratio would drop to stupid cheap levels thus it would've recovered and simply be a banger of a stock. For comparison something similar happened with META. It became so cheap it actually made a 30% rise in a single day from one good news which is very rare for a company valued at around 300-400$ billion at the time.

232,BABA," You're illustrating my point. The political climate for META in the US couldnt' be more different than the political climate in China. Trying to apply what's going on with META to BABA is a mistake. 

For instance, in the US there has been a ton of talk from politicians about monopolies. There are hearings and investigations into Meta, Google, etc. But nothing has happened as a result. It's just talk. In China, when the President said he wants common prosperity and fewer monopolies, they started heavily fining Alibaba and Tecent and encouraging their competitiors. Not saying either is correct, just that they are completely different. So the effects on the companies and their stocks are going to be completely different.

Munger did invest heavily in BABA, but he also came back and said it was one of his worst investments he's made. Interestingly, not because of the politics, but because he realized that retail companies have terrible margins. BABA's margins are a big problem for them that don't get mentioned enough.

Investing is difficult. Investing in China is double-difficult unless we take the time to really understand the culture and politics there. P/E is not going to cut it. I do have positions in Chinese ADRs, but they take a lot of research and work keeping up with. Anyone who doesn't want the trouble I would not blame.

My guess? The FED has done its best and will let inflation sit around 5-6% for a 2-3 more years, while also allowing interest rates to remain high as well.   The banks can’t handle too many more hikes.

284,IMO," Hey man, I'm actually not gonna shit on it like the rest, each of those are some of the best companies in existence right now, they are just priced a little rich for most people's blood.

And they likely have a point - if there aren't near-term surprise earnings beats there is a lot of potential for some dips.

If that is something you are concerned about, don't want to get caught feeling like you bought the top, break up your buy into 3 or 4 pieces. Buy 1 piece now, and wait and see for maybe 2 week before the next piece and so on.

I'm assuming you can afford the risk implied - but don't let pricing force you from buying a good company at a meh price to a meh company at a low price, IMO. People called tesla overvalued in 2017, but if you had vision and you understood their technological progress you made a killing. The people who sat around complaining about P/E just moved on to another thing to complain about - they will sound smart and they won't lose money, but they also aren't making any and risk missing generational wealth.

- High market cap does not mean safe, nor does it mean it's a good investment.

- A company doesn't have to collapse to be a poor investment, it doesn't even have to decline to be a poor investment compared to S&P index funds. 

- tech giants could severely underperform and the S&P will still do fine as they will be rebalanced with companies that are doing well
