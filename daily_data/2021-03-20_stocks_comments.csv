0,BIG," Let me say this, I was a broker from \~1988-2002 and in the '90s on Naked Shorts was an issue.  I was on a conference call talking to regulators (along with \~30 other folks) debating the pros and cons, even though it probably least understood Shorting is essential for the markets to work correctly, however, Naked Shorting is a huge threat to individual cos., market makers, and the brokerage firms, very much on the discount brokers.  With wirehouses they will find a borrow before they'll execute a short, in fact at one time for several years you had to call stock loan, make sure shares were available, and put the Auth # given to you by stock loan on the ticket!!  Then with discount brokers who had a skeleton back office you place a trade and the Short Sale it's immediately filled and nobody sees if there are borrows available now or when the trade was placed.  As much as so many dislike the BIG FIRMS this is primarily a disc. firm issue.  On that call, the regulators said ""we'll keep a close eye (via Stock Watch) and as we see naked shorts we'll call and make sure they have shares to borrow.  Over the next 10+ years, I've never spoken to anyone that had heard from the SEC ever!!",Thestockbroker22,294,/r/stocks/comments/m9d549/naked_short_selling_the_truth_is_much_worse_than/grmff2q/,0.029,0.915,0.057,0.6357
1,GME," As a new entrant to the stock market, one thing i can’t believe is actually possible, is the ability to bankrupt a company through the stock market. Through this whole GME thing, I’ve read of actual companies that have gone out of business simply because of short selling. Is that not ridiculous? All the people that lose their jobs. The contributions that company could have made to society, now lost. Imagine, if I somehow destroyed a company in any other way, I would probably go to jail. But, if I had enough money to do it through the stock market, not only do I not go to jail, but I probably make billions of dollars. Even with all the other crazy things going on with GME, this fact alone makes the stock market and SEC lose all legitimacy for me.

46,AI," Ok.  I'll be the bear here.  You can downvote me later.  I'll try to be as mean and as bearish as possible.

Disclaimer: I like Tesla.  I respect Musk for innovating in areas where everyone else scoffed at and dismissed.  I respect that.  It's improving society and the world.

Bear Case:

This is all just getting ridiculous and too much.  Investing needs to return to reality.  It will be better for everyone.

How do you even begin to value a software, car, insurance, battery, ride-hail service company?  What margins do you use?  What revenues?  Do you take the high margins from software and combine them with the massive revenues of automotive?

It's like a forecast of the Frankenstein monster company; stitched together with the best pieces of each sector.  Should we also add in dividend projections from the utility sector for Tesla's solar farm business?

All of this is just getting too crazy and makes less practical sense each day.  A company like this has never existed in human history!  But this time is different?  Why?  Because a fund manager who is hemorrhaging money (and - for great emphasis - not projected to hemorrhage money in the *future* \- but, is hemorrhaging money *today*) needs it to be true?  Because she is trying to save face before her whale clients pack up and leave?

Also, I thought they forecasted self driving to be live and in use across society by 2018.   And that failed.  I thought they were re-projecting a minimum of 10+ more years to solve the harder problems of dealing with visual impairments like snow and rain?  It's why most of the testing is stuck in the blue sky of Nevada and Arizona.  I think all the easy AI problems got solved 10 years ago - only the super hard ones are left.

And why do they believe Tesla is the most probable company to deliver this technology?  I don't know; I like Tesla and all, but, are they really going to beat Google, Amazon, and Apple in an AI tech race?  That seems highly improbable actually - not probable.

And then, there's this argument that Tesla is so far ahead of the other auto manufacturers; which is a true and factual statement.  However, it is not the complete picture.  The other auto manufacturers are always behind in technology.  They choose to be this way.  When the new inventions and technologies mature and arrive, they work out deals with the patent holders for the rights to put the tech in their cars.  They've always done this.  They are essentially outsourcing large portions of R&D.

So, what happens if just about any other company in the world discovers and patents important EV and self driving technologies other than Tesla?

In addition, another more prudent question is: Is Tesla beating Google and other silicon valley start-ups in AI and EV?  I don't think the answer to that question is obvious at all.  I think Tesla might actually be behind Google!  Waymo looks pretty promising.  And this goes back to the Frankenstein company dilemma.  You are rating the tech strength in Tesla to the tech strength in an auto company - which everyone already knows is weighted in favor of Tesla.  But, you are not punishing the Tesla valuation for its small revenues when compared to a true, auto giant.

(And, again, I really like Tesla - but I think the current share price is much, much risker than a lot of people realize.  They really need to deliver multiple world changing innovations at scale.)",TrottingGelato,116,/r/stocks/comments/m8xs17/ark_tesla_2025_price_target_update/grka4g5/,0.049,0.803,0.148,0.9963

My guess is that it's more likely TSLA will maintain its current price or rise slightly in a bull case scenario (because everyone seems to be kinda expecting a huge bull case scenario already). And it will go down significantly in a bear case scenario.

This is so misguided. If Tesla does solve full autonomy they have max 2 years of growth priced in. And if they never solve full autonomy at all, but maintain 30% growth after 2022 (they're targeting 50%) based on their automotive business alone they have max 5 years of growth priced in. Just doing the math for 2026:

* 4 million cars sold annually
* $30,000 average selling price (down from 50k today)
* 10% operating margin, around the same as current numbers due to economies of scale and technological advancements evening out reduction in car prices. Expectations are for them to increase operating margin.
* Puts them at a $30B net income annually from automotive.
* 60 PE (quite conservative if they're still growing 30% annually) would put them at a $616B market cap, slightly below today's value

76,FSD," Have they said that data collection is the real bottleneck for this particular problem domain, or in general?

I do ML for a living(not relating to self driving) and have been studying a bit about autonomous driving out of personal interest.

Data by itself is not useful. There needs to be ways to annotate large amounts of data for it to be useful, although methods exist to minimize the amount of labeling needed.

Self driving is not a single machine learning problem. There's a lot of different problems such as segmentation, localization, motion prediction, etc. There's also non-ML aspects such as control and decision making. Industry leaders(Waymo, Cruise) are taking advantage of better(albeit more expensive) sensor hardware and stronger assumptions(geofencing) to achieve more predictability and fewer disengagements.

If Tesla's advantage in data collection translated to better results, then it doesn't show in the latest FSD beta they released.

ML is very easy to hype up and poorly understood on the business side(I think Musk has made a lot of comments showing how uninformed he is). Blaming lack of progress on regulators when there is ample evidence your system can't handle non-edge cases is a bad look.

88,FSD," It doesn't really matter to be honest. Uber's market cap and financials are nowhere near Tesla's, so they would never be able to compete with Tesla in terms of how fast they could ramp up their fleet. Especially when you consider that Tesla could do it at a much lower price because they don't have to pay their own profit margin on the cars.

On top of that, if Tesla is the first to solve self driving, they would be able to launch it together with their platform and dictate how they roll that out. For example they could only allow full self driving in combination with their ride hailing platform and justify it by incorporating the insurance of the rides with their ride hailing platform (or just be a dick and say they don't allow commercial FSD when you're not using their platform, although I doubt they would do that).

Either way, Tesla will dominate how any of these things would be rolled out and even if Uber ordered a massive fleet from Tesla, Tesla would make huge profits on selling the fleet and Uber having to pay for the FSD packages, which at that point would be anywhere between $20k and $100k up front or $200-1000 monthly in subscriptions per car.",Ehralur,2,/r/stocks/comments/m8xs17/ark_tesla_2025_price_target_update/grl0vfy/,0.048,0.858,0.095,0.8225

The main reason for that high payment is that many of their CA customers dis-proportionally use Visa at their stores due to good cash back policy.  They didn't pay more to Visa because of higher fee (vs MA or other card).  They were hoping to convert some of Visa customers into cash payers.

A few months later, they reverse the ban w/o any explanation.  But in general, limiting customer from a popular choice is rarely a wise decision.

138,MA," In Slovakia (EU), all debit cards are MA or V, and card payments volume grows very fast and each year, much more payments are made in each category - cards themselvs, paysafe, GooglePay, etc. Both companies seem to pretty aggressively compete for market share, and it seems like the leader in market share changes every few years. Plenty of events are sponsored by them, like MA sponsoring a big festival, which lead to a nice perk of being able to pay with my phone at food booths, etc. MA also seems to be used by most challenger banks, by the way (both international and local).

Another thing I noticed when I was in Croatia a few years apart. The first time, you could only pay by cash in most places outside resorts, and had to use their currency. A few years later, most places accepted cards, and almost every restaurant had logos of either Visa or MasterCard engraved on the cover page of the bill holders, which I've never seen here, but seemed like an interesting strategy. They definitely targeted restaurants as a big source of revenue from foreign tourists and it seems like they focus their efforts smartly on the various differences between smaller markets.",PanPirat,2,/r/stocks/comments/m8xdbm/wsj_reports_on_visa_v_antitrust_probe_real/grkun9c/,0.016,0.844,0.14,0.9803

I will buy 10-25% if it dips 5%, if it dips again with no slowdown in sight I might just cut my losses and wait out the dip. If we end on a green day I'll probably trim 10% from my highest daily +% stocks. If they're green again in the morning and momentum is still high I might just buy back lol. For insane stocks like GME I'll have 5 stop orders with plenty of limit sell orders to take profits on the way up.

I basically know my desired long term positions (eg 3 NVDA) but will constantly be at 1-4 shares while I'm daytrading to lock in profits. I never sell my entire position unless I don't want to trade the stock anymore, and I will almosy never hold more than 2x my position (eg 6 NVDA)

About close end fund, I use the 2019 ones, USA was one of the top ones in 2019, have like 8 to 9% at the time after expense ratio, but 2021 has less, had STK and some other Pimco fund as well, they did paid quite well of dividend.

* why was part of the last congress hearing cut out by CNBC? Even if they were shills for Citadel, what was so problematic with that part? And if it wasn't, why was it cut out anyway?
* How the fuck is GME staying over 200 for so long with ""nothing sketchy going on""? Why did it even go up again? And why was there a battle around $200 dollars? I've been investing for ten years (mostly in local markets and conservative stuff like managed funds etc.), and I've never seen anything quite like the last few minutes of yesterday...
* Why do people talk about ""low volume""? Volume is still multiples higher on GME than it was before January, so volatility is actually still to expect. But then again, how can it be that there are hard price drops and breakouts with (relatively) low volume? Wouldn't lower volume result in a steady and slow pullback? Or is volume high enough to cause such violent drops and breakouts?
* While we're at it, what was up with AMC yesterday? It's rare to see a stock flatline like that, when it has actual volume?
* why in the world are there people literally brigading the shit out of every GME thread, writing multiple comments telling people to sell for their own sake and shit? Why would anyone care so much about strangers on the internet losing money to get so militant/aggressive? Is it just negative karma farming? Trolling? Or butthurt people that lost money and are now on angry crusades?
* Why the fuck would DFV stay in his position for so long? He could have walked away with 50+ million? I love the guy just for the memes, but that is insanity.  Do you think he sold by now? I know it doesn't matter, just curious.
* are there any 'organic' reasons that could explain what happened in the last few weeks? I know there's this theory that some whale pushed the stock up again and other whales fighting against that. If yes, I'd guess that fight is over and that's why it's dropping with low volume. But if that's whats happened, why did so many days end with photo finishes around particular prices? Is there still whales fighting about something? Or is it actually retail buying at certain key points, because they think ""oh no, it's 199, ape together strong, buy buy buy""? But if that's true, why does price always drop right before market close (yesterday it was 201.40 and trending upwards, when at 30 seconds before close, it violently dropped to 199 before closing right at 200.27 after a pushback)?
* Is there any world in where retail actually **does** hold most of the float and this shit could still blow up? Last I saw, there was ~40% of the float shorted. Does the number even matter? Wasn't VW only 12%? 

Anyway, I'd love some civil (and non-elitist) discussion about all this, because I can't really make sense of all of it. I like GME, mostly because I made around $8000 bucks in the first rally and it was fun (and stressful), but I'm not attached to it like most of WSB or detached and acting like it doesn't exist like people in other subs.

208,GME," I’ll try to use plain English to touch base on some things since there are many new investors with these questions as well

As for organic growth, this is what I believe is the most likely occurrence. I do think the CFO termination and Ryan Cohen announcement acted as catalysts when it jumped to $170, and the subsequent drop to $100 was a large group of people/entities that held exiting their position. As for the climb after, I do think it was fairly organic as it made its way to $200. For months, people held and swore “the squeeze hadn’t squoze”. Once it started climbing steadily, I’m sure a ton bought back in cause FOMO. Then when it took off up to $340, I believe that was due to calls being ITM and MM’s buying shares to plan for them being executed. As for the sudden 50% drop to $170 and immediate rebound to $260, I believe this was a whale exiting their position and buying back in at the dip to continue riding the retail momentum. Again, all of this is my opinion, but to me it is what makes the most sense out of the “conspiracy theories”.

You can’t trust the released numbers from this stock. That’s not to say it’s a conspiracy, but there are too many ways to legitimately provide false data, plus much of it is weeks old when reported. Now, it will be interesting to see how the new rules concerning short % and transparency affect that. 

Here’s the thing, anyone who says GME is done is full of it, they said that throughout all of February and we are closing in on a month since the last explosion and we are still over $200.00 per share for fucking GameStop!!! It makes zero fucking sense for it to hold at these levels for so long. It could plummet next week back down to $40, it could explode back to $300, it could actually squeeze up to $1,000, or it could hover around a few dollars up or down. Which is most likely? Which is least? It’s all guessing at this point.

In closing, there are some upcoming events encouraging people to hold. Earnings on Tuesday is a catalyst, though I doubt it will change much. Announcing a new CFO or giving clarity to Ryan Cohens position are also possible, these could provide a nice boost. People are leaving RH after they revealed that they don’t own the GME shares, meaning they’ll have to buy them when people transfer out. Also, a new CFO could recall the shares since they are over 100%, which would be the catalyst with the most potential. Then DFV’s options, but people would have to hold until med-April for that. So .... if you’ve held until now, why leave?




Staying over $200 & low volume are both due to people holding and the price being too high for new investors to buy in, at least not enough to move the needle, It really is that simple. There were some sketchy looking trade chart numbers (like 53 shares being bounced back and forth like 15-20 times in a row Friday), so I don’t doubt that the stock is being manipulated, but as someone else stated, entities are making a killing off of options.

As for supposed Citadel & Melvin spies on Reddit. Could be true, could be WSB members fuckin with them, there are a lot of members who hate the GME movement and crowd. Regardless, I don’t think it’s having much of an effect.

DFV clearly enjoys the position he is in. He has made a killing already, and being such an important individual to people has to be addicting. When he sells his position (or posts it if he has), that is all gone. There are people who don’t care about money to the level of others.

209,RH," I’ll try to use plain English to touch base on some things since there are many new investors with these questions as well

As for organic growth, this is what I believe is the most likely occurrence. I do think the CFO termination and Ryan Cohen announcement acted as catalysts when it jumped to $170, and the subsequent drop to $100 was a large group of people/entities that held exiting their position. As for the climb after, I do think it was fairly organic as it made its way to $200. For months, people held and swore “the squeeze hadn’t squoze”.

210,GME," Less than 20% of the float is currently shorted last I read. VW may have only had 12% of the float shorted, but Porsche quietly acquired a 74% stake, while the local government of Saxony owned a 20.2% stake. On top of that, other institutions owned about 4%, so there was only about 1.8% of the float available to trade when Porsche made their position public. VW ran up 800%. GME ran up 1500%.  What’s happening now is a couple whales are duking it out, and the recent rise in price looks to have been triggered by a massive buy on the 24th that put a lot of MMs in a position where they had to buy to hedge a lot of open monthly calls that were close to being in the money. 

Just as many apes are brigading traditional investment subs as there are people trying to give advice to sell before the floor falls out again. 

DFV is under a lot of scrutiny so he needed to get back in. His original bet was $100 tops. He doesn’t have a crystal ball and he’s not a prophet.

240,DD," There is a huge difference. An organized naked short group can drive down the stock in minutes and create FUD and rip people off that invested legitimately. People pumping stock do not force others to put there money in... but when shorters organize and attack a stock they are forcing people to sell or simply have their investment devalued and stolen from and artificially reducing the value of a company. One is pure theft. The other may or may not be theft but people have a choice. FOMO won't cost you your bank account if you do your DD. Shorting can and there is nothing one can do about it. Even if you know what is going on, if other investors don't then it doesn't mean you won't be screwed in the process. Organized shorting used to devalue a stock is theft. It has nothing to do with ""quality control""... that is what the psychopaths tell themselves and others to justify their theft.

If a person doesn't think a stock is valuable they sell and if someone else does then they buy it... A shorter doesn't give a fuck about the value of a company, they only care about stealing other peoples money. Why the hell do you think there are so many billionaires now? It isn't because they actually work hard. Why do so many companies go down even though they are fundamentally sound? Shorters fuck over society and are the last kinds of people you want to enrich besides murderers and drug kingpins. They literally ruin millions of peoples lives just so they can get their yachts, mansions, and hookers. How much money has been stolen from pensions, 401k's, etc?

241,GME," Um, when you drive down a stock to ""test"" it and continue doing that you are not stress testing a stock, you are intentionally trying to extract money from it. You short the stock quickly to drive it down using coordinated attacks. Buying generally occurs over time since any coordinated buying is inefficient use of money. Shorting can drive down the stock with almost no downside except if the stock is not driven down... which doesn't happen unless buyers are able to rally against it in time(which happened with GME to some degree).

Shorters intentionally try to fuck over investors and it has nothing to do with finding bad companies, that is just an excuse. There is almost no downside for shorters in doing this. They can short a stock to drive it down and profit on it then allow it to go back up and profit on that too. The reason it forces some holders to sell is psychological, because if people see a stock crash they do not want to lose their investment and sell.

Same with Microsoft. If noone wants it, it's just a pointless list of zeros.
That said, Microsoft isn't just a stock; it's got massive amounts of inventory, contacts, contracts, logistic networks,  IP, etc. If it collapsed, that would all be liquidated and debts paid to people in order.
