152,SA," Not only that but gov is notoriously slow and incompetent. Some more than others like the Cdn gov especially conservatives since they were the one's in power provincially. Marijuana was legalized in 2018, and Canada had some of the biggest producers in NA. First mover advantage right? Well for a while they had that, and some snatched up production in SA, Europe. However, here we are in 2021. Despite covid these companies had a lead, they just didn't have effective government. For example in Ontario one of the most population dense provinces weed could only be sold in an authorized store. This caused massive delay's.  You had product that wasn't being shipped out. If you want to buy online, you have to by through a government store. Which is stupid since it should be free market. All that time  and red tape cost money. Now you have US legalization, and a far more lucrative market than Canada; I can't speak for the US gov, but from what I see at the federal level under Biden and blue states, you guy's have better leaders than we do.

159,DM," I just did my thesis on the medical applications of Psolicybin for treatment resistant depression (if anyone wants it DM me and I'll get you it) . 

 Quick Notes:

13.2% of American Adults 18+ take SSRIs

Current antidepressants (SSRIs) do work.. they lower symptoms by 50% for only 60% of patients. 40% had no reduction, and 100% were still symptomatic.

Psilocybin + Therapy reduced symptoms by 60% for all patients (12), after a single treatment consisting of 10mg oral Psilocybin. After a second dose of 25mg oral Psilocybin a week later, symptoms were reduced by 80% for 3 patients, and 100% for 9 patients.

Project Angie: (Mind Medicine) Research shows that pre dosage with an LSD compound removes the need for post surgical analgesics for up to 36 hours.This is good for health care because less opiates, but bad for big pharma.

Problems: Not a single company is working with a unique compound. So far, zero pharmaceutical innovation.  They are innovative with their treatment however. FDA approval is doubtful until at least 2023, but they can work in other countries that allow clinical applications of psychedelics. 

Keep in mind, these companies have isolated the useful compounds and have taken out the 'trip'... (if you've done Psychedelics, you'll understand this). Changes the way you think about life, no pretty lights. But this is for medical purposes, our recreational stuff is gonna stay the same.

TL;DR

Psychedelics work better than SSRIs, with less doses needed.
Long term investment until FDA approval.

I think the TLDR would be buy stocks that consistently grow their revenue, earnings, net income, etc lame ass Warren buffet stuff. Typical stuff.  I don’t read stocks financial statements because I don’t have enough time.

I think it’s awesome people are YOLO’ing and taking risk.  If you’re curious Id like to know your age and what % of portfolio.
I almost yolo’d my similar size Roth out of Fidelity’s blue chip growth fund into TSLA today but my wife was like wtf you don’t need to do that, we’re still in our 20’s, although about to be 30. I canceled the order because I figure 10k is Tesla is good enough and I’ll just chip into Tesla next paycheck.

Anyways, I think GameStop is a terrible idea. I’ll tell why soon. -I work in real estate and they didn’t even do a 1 year lease renewal at the same rent, they were begging for a rent reduction.  I don’t do one year leases for a tenant that has extended their business model beyond its viable length due to genius ability to adapt to survive.  

Here’s why I think it’s a terrible idea.  Blockbuster had a good run, Kmart had a good run, sometimes it just ends.  GameStop doesn’t have any key advantages left, it’s not even big enough to be a category killer type store like Best Buy or Ulta.  They occupy 1500-2000 sq ft which Walmart and target just copy inside there store, 2nd msft and Sony have created the store on their game system, you don’t even have to leave your house and you can store your credit cards on file(this is a wet dream, MSFT can just middleman this stuff through their App Store), 3rd physical disks are kind of lame to put in to play when digital is easy to swap from game to game, 4 even if you buy a hard copy you still have to update sometimes. 5 I don’t know this isn’t financial advice, buying TQQQ would be a better choice if you want to gamble or TSLA or just be lame and get VTSAX",kslay23,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nbjhc1/yolo_i_switched_jobs_in_january_and_just_yolod_my/gy0zmuu/,0.089,0.751,0.16,0.9806

They occupy 1500-2000 sq ft which Walmart and target just copy inside there store, 2nd msft and Sony have created the store on their game system, you don’t even have to leave your house and you can store your credit cards on file(this is a wet dream, MSFT can just middleman this stuff through their App Store), 3rd physical disks are kind of lame to put in to play when digital is easy to swap from game to game, 4 even if you buy a hard copy you still have to update sometimes. 5 I don’t know this isn’t financial advice, buying TQQQ would be a better choice if you want to gamble or TSLA or just be lame and get VTSAX",kslay23,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nbjhc1/yolo_i_switched_jobs_in_january_and_just_yolod_my/gy0zmuu/,0.089,0.751,0.16,0.9806

207,AI," One of the biggest misunderstood factors is globalization: as capitalists seek the lower cost of production, they go oversea. Yes, blocking China might work temporarily, same as the Covid induced trade reduction. But they just move their productions to other countries like Viet, India, Mexico etc. before they ever come back to the US and Europe. So the lower-cost competition will always pull back the inflation as the western higher cost workers can't just compete.  

I see the current inflation is transitory and unless something more fundamental happens (such as war,  3D prints, AI etc.), this low rate environment (or low inflation) will be for a while, a long while.",largib,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nbdztx/why_potential_inflation_could_lead_to_a_financial/gy0fhu4/,0.137,0.82,0.042,-0.8879

214,OR," What people don't realize is that a lot of the money ""injected"" was replacing wages earned so people could survive. It's not like the people were earning wages AND receiving stimulus/unemployment cheques. There was obviously a small percentage that were able to scam the system and receive both, but for the most part you were either:

1) Too wealthy and did not receive unemployment OR stimulus.

2) Middle class that received stimulus, but continued to work (no unemployment).

3) Middle class that received stimulus and also got laid off, so received unemployment.

4) Lower class that received stimuuls and received unemployment due to being jobless.

&#x200B;

In almost all scenarios people were using the stimulus money to survive and pay rent. So the question we should ask is how much of the ""free"" money was actually a surplus, thus will contribute to inflation.

&#x200B;

Example, John earns $1,000 a month at his job and spend roughly $900/month on living expenses and surviving. All of a sudden John is laid off and received 2x $1,200 stimulus cheques over the period of one year for an average of $200 a month. He also receives $900 a month in unemployment benefits. His surplus from ""free"" money is only $100 because he is still spending $1,000 on living expenses. He still has a mortgage to pay, car payments, and needs to buy food, just as he \*normally\* would if he had a job.

A lot of people are seeing $2,400 in helicopter money + unemployment when the reality is that there isn't much surplus UNLESS you are gaming the system.",TheMacroDrip,-4,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nbdztx/why_potential_inflation_could_lead_to_a_financial/gxz7xex/,0.036,0.874,0.09,0.9523

277,TSLA," Inflation increases the cost of materials to make things if this happens top quickly then people won't be able to afford to buy the things you're making. Meaning you can't price hike your way out of it. 

Homes for example. A new house costs a lot of money and low interest rates drove the demand up. Couple that with lumber production bottlenecked at the saw mills and the cost to build a home increases faster than people's concept of what a that home should cost to buy. 

Keep in mind everyone is trying to be first so they're anticipating that certain sectors might cool down a little. 

TSLA needs copper, lithium, etc to make their cars. All those things are going up. Inflation also means interest rates might increase to tamp down demand and so there is another issue that can drive down spending. 

So if people are pulling out to get cash it might be worth having cash on hand to buy a big anticipated dip.",Donkeyotee3,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nb2q6d/omg_inflation/gxxiclz/,0.029,0.859,0.112,0.926

279,GDP," The markets are trying to push an inflation narrative to keep wages low. Thing is places that have kept their wages low are unable to hire new workers due to the fact people refuse to work for $7.25. Only in places where the minimum is $15 are people filling vacancies, and that is still a tepid pace.

What is going on is the rise of prices is coming from the cost of trying to make sure that products get to consumers, and those are on skeleton crews too, so overtime is through the roof. So THAT cost gets passed to the consumer so they can keep their COVID profits.

The real damage this virus has done to our economy is about to appear. If anything, I'm starting to eyeball our GDP taking a poop soon, and this inflation issue goes bye-bye and stagnation becomes the status-quo. If people can't buy shit because they got no money, how is America's consumer economy going to survive? The chickens have finally come home to roost.

The money should be going into companies that have been keeping their workers happy. When it comes to looking to going for future investments, look at companies that are going to be going forward with a large worker base that has good support, as it is known that a company that treats it's workers well end up seeing their wages return as those workers do business with that company.

596,PLTR," Here's a problem commonly found in tech. How do you unify things together? The medicine field is horribly bastardized by the American healthcare system. Medical documents and studies are often trapped in a single private company and becomes difficult to access anywhere else. PLTR is a software that, and i quote from their demo day, ""is the connective tissue"" that can link together that data and community. When it comes to medicine, security and efficiency is imperative to success. That's why PLTR played a significant role helping the CDC roll out the covid vaccine. PLTR is a software that unifies data, and gives it's customers a flexible easy to use application to send data, build projects, and maintain security all in a single system. PLTR's Foundry platform allows customers to program scripts to create automated systems based on data changes in the company, write documentation for large companies to easily understand each other, and provides a communication systems to speed up bureaucracy. PLTR is a software that is applicable to any kind of company with a lot of data, which is pretty much any large scale company.... PLTR is dipping real hard now because most people lack this understanding, but PLTR will make waves in the backend of any company. I'm real excited to see what they plan on doing with the medical industry in particular. They just released news about partnering with an institution that conducts cancer studies. And they already have the us government in it's claws. Doubtful the military will ever let go of them.

656,GOOD," So, only one time?  And they improved inventory discovery by 25 days?  How is this negative?  When should they have made this major improvement?  July?

The silver army is now armed for the future with more current data.  THIS IS GOOD.  Regardless of if you like silver or not.

The silver squeeze wasn't going to happen in May, there was too much silver in COMEX, London would just declare force majeur and you'd get like a $3 pop (really no idea, but nothing crazy) while boats got loaded with silver to cross the Atlantic.

What you are missing with your short term view, is that if the conditions were ever right, whales can now be more certain than ever as the reporting lag is 25 days less.  You'd need someone like the Hunt Brothers to cause the mega spike.  IMO it's stupid, just let silver be an industrial commodity again, nobody uses it as money anymore.

Ignore the timing, this without a doubt is improved discovery.  This is progress and whomever has conspiracies about manipulation now has a far quicker view of actual conditions.  This is a long term market positive, 100%.

Note: could care less about silver and the price, big fan of quicker reporting of anything.

658,JPM," That's the point of this post.  A squeeze very likely could have occurred if in fact this is true.  JPM operates in a large silver vault in London.  This accounting ""error"" dates back to when Silver popped $3, but didn't continue because it appeared there was enough demand. 

JPM is also the custodian of SLV- which had massive inflows.  They potentially couldn't source silver at the market price (even up $3), and even changed their prospectus in the days after to note that they may night buy the metals. 

If any thing this raises the question of  was this error actually fraud - fraud that was caused by paper reporting of silver that didn't exists.  Silver that SLV was unable to source, and thus in a natural market would be required to be sourced at a higher and higher price (a squeeze)...",Elchupanebre4,5,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nazngd/the_tamp_down_team_a_wholly_owned_subsidiary_of/gxxppgj/,0.107,0.859,0.034,-0.9215

742,EXP," approximately: today is t, tomorrow is t+1, so on.

\- flip a coin to see if it will go up or down t+1, flip again for t+2, flip until t+n (n days in the future)

\- repeat this 100 million times (hire them smart kids from singapore)

\- and then you have 100 million hypothetical evolutions of the stonk. The chart shows the best 75% I think, the worst 1%, the EXP is the average of the millions of hypothetical evolutions, probably.

&#x200B;

hope this helps. flipping the coin is a simplification, what you do is you see how the stonk behaves in the past and you create a coin that flips just like stonk does, and then you flip that coin, which might be a bit different than the 1/2 chance a normal coin has. If the past distribution is exactly 50% 50% your simulation is probably worthless.

916,IOR," Cash is not the same thing as reserves. Banks need to hold reserves to back up any deposits that they are liable to meet withdrawals for, thus any short-term and accessible checking accounts + since recently savings account (which is why M1 shot up but M2 only moderately increased).

Since banks aren't doing that much lending, those extra reserves, that would otherwise have gone to required reserves if banks had lent out money, are piling up since they can just get free positive interest. The cash a bank would get from another participant is not Fed reserves, thus they cannot earn IOER on it.

Remember, reserves constitute base money (+ coins and paper) and only banks have access to them and trade them among each other in the Fed funds market. This is what the Fed targets when you hear they are ""setting rates at x%"", which is the rate at which banks borrow reserves from each other. They try to make reserves as scarce or abundant as needed so banks would borrow from each other at within this band. If IOER > IOR, then banks that hold more reserves don't have an incentive to lend out excess reserves if the rate they're getting adjusted credit risk of the marginal loan is less than IOER since they wouldn't lend reserves to other banks. This gets complicated with you and I paying each other with cash and the banks have to settle daily transactions with reserves, that's why this market is always active (if I pay you, what actually happens is my bank loses a deposit and your bank gains a deposit > your bank needs to have reserves to back this deposit etc).

1023,AAPL," That‘s really not what I mean tho. High P/E stocks and specs in general are bleeding since Feb or so. Time to sell was either Dezember/Jan or never. 

Also, I don‘t believe this is the botton, I believe I will never time the bottom. But I know Tesla won‘t drop 90% from ATH‘s so I‘m buying whenever shares fall below $600, same with other stocks. 

I see your argument when looking at the indices, as they haven‘t moved much. There‘s probably more bleeding as you say, but it will be in the exact stocks you recommend... EV/specs are down 30-60% while consumer staples and recovery stocks have surged. Markets always find a equilibrium, so either you believe specs/EV will rubber-band up to level out with recovery or the other way around. I believe recovery (and with that said the indices) will drop to level out until the correction is over. But EV/specs won‘t drop more than 20%, because there isn‘t mire space to go lower. 

Just my opinion, but I have been in the markets for a while... still, i hope AAPL works for you, I also bought some shares yesterday and planning to add when it drops more, but to me it‘s a safe long time play while specs are the ones making bank.",flo12345sta,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nb9pm0/is_this_dip_really_different_or_is_it_run_of_the/gxyfoxu/,0.063,0.863,0.074,0.5267

They're selling you an idea that they are unique in terms of managed care, data collection, and payment system and they are not. It is easy to appear that way but what they are doing is exactly what Medicare advantage is suppose to do and they're not even doing it well. From a broker perspective I would not enroll a client in this plan if they are suitable options, it would literally be my last choice because the big guys can offer so much and they're already doing it well. Best case is if CLOV was doing something innovative that would be swallowed up by a larger player and I don't even see that. They may grow but they're never going to have market share in this space.

1053,ASML," Investing in semiconductors is actually a big risk and it looks attractive because of the chip shortages however in the long run it's a huge risk.


The problem with semiconductors is the long period of time it needs to profit on investments. All semiconductors are investing crazy amounts of money and are incentivised to do so by governments and manufacturers of electronics.


This is very risky since a few decades ago we have seen the margins of semiconductors can get very slim and when the demand decreases a race to the bottom emerges. The only way to earn back the big initial investments is to keep producing chips even if the profitability is very low. This keeps going untill the smaller manufacturers can't cope with the costs anymore.


Examples are SMIC, globalfoundaries, even ASML had to cut massively in jobs 20 years ago.
