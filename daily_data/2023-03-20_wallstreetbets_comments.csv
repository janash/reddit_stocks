67,AI," No, it absolutely would not. What a depression would do is cause an asset deflationary event, which sounds great if you're struggling to pay prices right now, but it would mean that all the stuff we buy would experience a margin collapse.

That collapse would basically collapse the supply chain.

This is the problem all the ""depression plox"" regards here don't understand: When you de-leverage assets, and debt stays at the same level, and bootstrap costs remain the same for scaling up industry, it basically disincentivizes the production of goods because they no longer have a profit margin and a functional market because the insolvency of the system is causing the collapse. 

This then collapses wage, but we went through a deflationary event, so prices are good, right? 

No, prices have now skyrocketed because supply has dropped out, and you have stagflation. Your buying power isn't actually better if you don't have a job and everyone's wages have collapsed.

This creates an impossible to solve situation without more pain, and probably geo-political strife (which is what happened during the Great Depression, and that's not an accident).

See, here's the thing: Inflation during growth is easy to solve. You mildly, slowly increase rates while allowing wages to increase at lower than inflationary rates, which is where we are and largely have been through this inflationary period. With wage growth below inflation (actually it can go a bit above, as much as 2x in growth above inflation without a wage/price spiral if the lower classes are the primary gainers since they debt spend so much it takes that much to put pressure on the supply chain) you don't get any pressure on goods or services because prices are increasing faster than wages can keep up.

That's how you solve the inflationary problem. We had wage growth top out at 5% during the 2% inflation period, for instance. So we're already in the state where hyperinflation isn't in the cards with the supply chain coming back and things stabilizing after the pandemic.

It's the overreaction to that which causes depressions: the bank runs, the over-tightening, the emergency actions which break down the economy and supply chain.

And that's not just 10 years. If you were wealthy and didn't lose everything in 1929, you were back before the 1940s in many cases.

If you were in the lower 50% of society, though, you didn't see return to standard in most cases until the 1960s. We talk about the 1950s being a boomtown, but that's mostly for people who came back and were already in an empowered situation... this didn't generalize out to broad opportunity until almost 30 years after the Great Depression began.

Depressions destroy wealth on a generational scale, and they do that because deflationary asset cycles crash the entire productivity engine of consumer economies, and they take the states they happen in down with them (which for some of the people on here is actually the point, but that's a whole other topic).

Most of the regards on here hoping for a depression wouldn't even survive a depression right now. A depression right now would shift the scales more towards higher tech work because the only way to bootstrap an economic destabilization right now would be to push AI and other automation to reduce the productivity costs of bootstrapping a new labor industry, which would ultimately significantly disempower lower end workers, who are in all truth most of the people on here who complain about this stuff.

Under normal circumstances the acquirer pays a premium to what is considered the ""fair market value"" of the target company and thus is technically ""overpaying"". The net result is a capital loss for the acquiring company and usually results in a temporary drop in share price of the acquirer (and a pump in the target company). Ideally, the merger of both companies eventually leads to synergies whereby paying this premium becomes worth it due to being able to cut costs or other advantages gained by the merged entity (such as market pricing power). Yet these advantages are far from always achieved.

In this case however, it is a ""saving"" acquisition far below the market price due to the considerable amount of liabilities that must also be onboarded. The reason why it is done so far below the market price is because of the following: Even though individual investors were still willing to pay up to 1.8CHF per share for a stake in Credit Suisse on friday, that stake does not come with attached liabilities.

124,CS," Because a company can derive its value from two factors:

\- It's ability to generate profits (now and in the future)

\- It's **net** asset value.

The former is its value as a going concern. The latter is its (theoretical) liquidation value.

&#x200B;

If I buy shares in a company I base the price I am willing to pay on the profits that company can generate for me over the course of its existence and the portion of that which is attributable to me as a shareholder.

&#x200B;

However, when a company stops operating and goes into liquidation, that means no more future profits can be expected. Yet, that doesn't necessarily mean there is no value left for shareholders. The value of a share then represents a residual claim on whatever remains after all the companies assets have been sold off AFTER all costs and debt holders of the company are paid. The remaining value is attributable to all shareholders and is positive only if net assets exceed net liabilities. If the liabilities exceed the assets that value is zero and an additional risk occurs because now the debt holders are at risk of losing (some) of their stake as well.

&#x200B;

Both valuations are relevant to mergers and acquisitions. The first valuation is most relevant for a company like Figma, where adobe values the company on its ability to generate additional profits as a part of Adobe.

&#x200B;

The other valuation is relevant when an acquirer believes a company is trading below what the net liquidation value of the company is. Here, the acquirer is intending to liquidate the entire company upon acquisition. Sell off all its assets, pay its liabilities and pocket what is left over.

&#x200B;

Normally a takeover would never happen at a discount, because the shareholders, which actually own the company, still have to approve the takeover and its price. But this is a very special case whereby there is a real concern that leaving the bank untouched would result in bankruptcy, wiping out not only the shareholders but also the depositors so the government stepped in. Banks are a special and very complicated case. Where in a normal company forced liquidation of assets could only happen when debt comes due and it cannot be covered (i.e., bankruptcy), banks are essentially funded by short term debt that may come due at any time (i.e., deposits). Banks only hold a small portion of their deposits as cash so when a large number of depositors make claim on their money NOW, it means the banks are forced to sell assets NOW. Due to the rising interest rates the assets of the bank, which consisted out of a lot of long term bonds, had dropped in value significantly and being forced to sell them means they have to take losses. This resulted in a real risk where the bank would be forced into bankruptcy because its liabilities suddenly exceeded its assets. This puts everyone from equity holders, to bond holders but also depositors at risk (as a depositor, you are essentially loaning money to the bank). So its ability to continue as a going concern is very much at risk, which leaves the ""value"" somewhere between a positive number on valuation 1, but a negative value if the company doesn't make it (valuation 2).

125,NOW," Because a company can derive its value from two factors:

\- It's ability to generate profits (now and in the future)

\- It's **net** asset value.

The former is its value as a going concern. The latter is its (theoretical) liquidation value.

&#x200B;

If I buy shares in a company I base the price I am willing to pay on the profits that company can generate for me over the course of its existence and the portion of that which is attributable to me as a shareholder.

&#x200B;

However, when a company stops operating and goes into liquidation, that means no more future profits can be expected. Yet, that doesn't necessarily mean there is no value left for shareholders. The value of a share then represents a residual claim on whatever remains after all the companies assets have been sold off AFTER all costs and debt holders of the company are paid. The remaining value is attributable to all shareholders and is positive only if net assets exceed net liabilities. If the liabilities exceed the assets that value is zero and an additional risk occurs because now the debt holders are at risk of losing (some) of their stake as well.

&#x200B;

Both valuations are relevant to mergers and acquisitions. The first valuation is most relevant for a company like Figma, where adobe values the company on its ability to generate additional profits as a part of Adobe.

&#x200B;

The other valuation is relevant when an acquirer believes a company is trading below what the net liquidation value of the company is. Here, the acquirer is intending to liquidate the entire company upon acquisition. Sell off all its assets, pay its liabilities and pocket what is left over.

&#x200B;

Normally a takeover would never happen at a discount, because the shareholders, which actually own the company, still have to approve the takeover and its price. But this is a very special case whereby there is a real concern that leaving the bank untouched would result in bankruptcy, wiping out not only the shareholders but also the depositors so the government stepped in. Banks are a special and very complicated case. Where in a normal company forced liquidation of assets could only happen when debt comes due and it cannot be covered (i.e., bankruptcy), banks are essentially funded by short term debt that may come due at any time (i.e., deposits). Banks only hold a small portion of their deposits as cash so when a large number of depositors make claim on their money NOW, it means the banks are forced to sell assets NOW. Due to the rising interest rates the assets of the bank, which consisted out of a lot of long term bonds, had dropped in value significantly and being forced to sell them means they have to take losses. This resulted in a real risk where the bank would be forced into bankruptcy because its liabilities suddenly exceeded its assets. This puts everyone from equity holders, to bond holders but also depositors at risk (as a depositor, you are essentially loaning money to the bank). So its ability to continue as a going concern is very much at risk, which leaves the ""value"" somewhere between a positive number on valuation 1, but a negative value if the company doesn't make it (valuation 2).

135,UI," Been dealing with this issue in France for many months, now. Looking for a job because my company is paying more in taxes than pulling profits. It's not even just an issue on skilled jobs, it's very often on entry-level unskilled positions. You see the same job ad reposted for months despite having applied several times and been answered several times that despite your qualities they were going to pursue a more compatible person (which usually only makes sense if they legit have another applicant who's already done the same job, at which point they're not necessarily better off hiring them, since they no longer have that job).   


I had theorized that the purpose was to just be able to tell current employees that they were trying to hire to fix the excess workload, but they just weren't getting any good applicants, because I once heard a cashier complain about this to a colleague of hers. She said they weren't getting any valid applicants. To be a cashier. Let that sink in. They believed that crap. I also saw it first hand inside a company I used to work for. They had their UI/UX designer doubling as graphic designer, and let him interview many people over more than a year, and never signed the people who approved, claiming their salarial requests were too high. One day he offered me the job, since I have training in that department, so I took his application test, delivered a fully functional app prototype when he was just asking for a few slides, and asked the direction if I could just move to that position. Suddenly the answer was ""uh... Actually, I don't know if we really need someone."" However, they couldn't really keep that up since I was in touch with the designer and he would know if they were just fake hiring, so they granted it but with a transition period from my service, during which I'd have to split my time and workload. They never hired anyone to replace me at my previous position, so after months in this situation, being paid for my previous job only, I just told them to screw themselves. I know that when I got hired they were also kind of cornered into saying yes because I was being recommended by my brother whose service was the one they'd been fake hiring for for over a year. They probably had PTSD flashbacks when I cornered them a second time on the same crap.  


I hadn't thought about companies doing this to project an image of a company which is growing, but I guess that makes sense when seeking investors or wanting to boost stock, or even just looking for new clients who might look into how serious of a company you are. I was expecting them to do this just in case someone incredible showed up, or just to have an emergency solution if someone left, though.

When I stated that something 'may be' because of their personal decisions, that does not imply that it is the culprit for ALL homeless people. I did not say that people ONLY have themselves to blame. My point was that the supply of empty homes is a false narrative that does not explain the problem.  If people were made financially destitute over medical bills, the supply of empty homes would not fix that problem, would it?

Like it or not, personal choices are the main problem involved.  That does not mean we should not help others or ignore the problem.  I have been legitimately hungry in my life, to the point where I went days at a time without eating because I could not afford to buy food, and refused to accept handouts or just steal it.   My problems were my fault because of stupid financial decisions that came back to haunt me.  I learned from it.

I do not accept the hand-wringing and virtue signaling that goes with this problem.  Consequences for stupid personal decisions will put you at risk in this world.  That is Mother Nature telling you to do better and learn.

I can already tell you what is going to happen with all these American-made electric vehicles:  The CEOs all told their firms that they ""WOULD"" be making electric cars this year.  Feedback from the ground up about technical issues was met with ""WE WILL MAKE A CAR THIS YEAR"".   I'm betting my money that over the next few years you're going to see these premium, over-priced cars fail.  Some already have. Many more will.  People will learn that if they want an EV they need to get a Tesla. And while other automakers will learn to make them over the next 10 years, the damage will be generational.  How would you feel if you had purchased an EV for $70,000 only to find out it had a two year life before major repairs and problems made it nearly worthless.  That is what is going to happen IMO.  I've seen it too many times before form other companies from IBM to Microsoft.  Products issued to meet a deadline that were not ready. It's one thing when you buy a $3000 computer.

234,UK," you hear about Credit Suisse's massive screw up? They loaned money to a shady company called Greensill Capital, which makes loans to other companies. Greensill turned those loans into investment funds that Credit Suisse sold to their clients as a safe bet.

But guess what? Greensill's business model was sketchy as hell. They had a few big clients and their founder had ties to a former UK Prime Minister. Fast forward to March 2021, Greensill goes bankrupt and Credit Suisse and their clients are left holding the bag. Turns out those ""low-risk"" investments were actually super risky and impossible to sell.

Credit Suisse totally dropped the ball by not doing their homework, not managing their risks properly, and not taking the risks of Greensill's business model seriously.

475,FRC," I agree, FRC isn’t anything like SVB. Although FRC has a lot of unrealized losses on its book it doesn’t necessarily have to sell them. SVB was seeing the deposits shrink so they had to sell. And even then they could’ve made it if there wasn’t a bank run. Venture Capital is a small world and once they hear one big fund is pulling out they will all follow. FRC banks the ultra wealthy across different industries. It would be highly unlikely for a bank run to happen that quickly at FRC as their clientele is fragmented across different industries. Now FRC has $30bn in deposits from the large banks and the fed backing so a bank run wouldn’t hurt them as bad. SVB’s failure is largely due to the lack of diversification of their client base.  People are looking at unrealized losses to gauge who’s next. They should really look at which banks have a large concentration in a declining industry.",qwertfdsav,11,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/11vybmv/the_situations_at_svb_and_frc_are_materially/jcwcg0a/,0.105,0.845,0.05,-0.8834

488,FRC," 68% of deposits at FRC are uninsured (the majority). The average account size being less than 200k is likely also true. They aren’t mutually exclusive. But there is still a risk of the really large accounts moving their money forcing them to sell bonds at a loss. Note that SVB had 97% of deposits that were uninsured tho, so FRC is definitely in a better position than SVB when it comes to the risk of a bank run causing a collapse.

563,FRC," I know this probably isn't the best place for a rational discussion, but for the life of me I seem to be too stupid to understand why FRC is getting annihilated this badly. Sure, earnings might suck for a few quarters as they have to service liquidity debt, and I'm sure that some of their depositors are in the wind never to return, but I still don't think that either of those things could possibly amount to a 90% free fall in share price. 

So is it some kind of insider knowledge? Fear of immense dilution by private offering/conversion of the $30bn to shares? Activist short sellers trying to bring the company's stock to its knees? All three?

People here are people who bought at the top when memes were at its peak. They are reasonably spiteful bagholders. It's not the way to invest in this company though. I bought in during DPO around ~$10 and rode the wave up. I made a lot selling calls. I've expanded my holdings around $6-$7~ and it looks like now is the time that it's going to start paying off. Their business is proving to be sticky. Even while all big tech is slumping during this tech winter, Palantir actually started turning profitable. Smart money's moving in (Vanguard and Blackrock around a total of $1.6b total inflow last 12 months) whereas retail is losing grip. Not to mention, SBC is shrinking. The bears' argument of insider selling and dilution sounds scary but when you dig into the numbers, most of that happened around 2021 which was part of the DPO deal that people should have been aware of already.
