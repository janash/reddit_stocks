iFresh Inc. is a supermarket chain offering online grocery ordering around the East Coast. The company specializes in Asian-American foods and is working to capitalize on this market. The company states that it has a proprietary in-house delivery network. Also, it has a strong online sales channel. These items together have helped it to grow during the pandemic. Because of its growing size, the company can offer specialty Asian foods at a lower price than many of its competitors. While iFresh doesn‚Äôt put out too many announcements, it did release its Q2 2020 financial results a few months ago. In the results for the quarter ended on September 30th, iFresh posted net sales of $24.2 million. This represents a small increase over the same period of the previous year.

31,DD," u/GermanRocketMan_13 I invite you to look at CELZ  Creative Medical Technology Holdings. I have done a ton of DD on them but my Reddit account is still too new to post it for the benefit and enjoyment of all. They are OTC, very high risk. Those considering investing should not allocate funds they cannot afford to lose completely. That said, I'm confident these guys are the real deal. I got in last summer at .0017. Yesterday closed at .0425, with a recent high of .13 last month. They hold multiple patents for stem cell therapies, and have commercialized therapies for erectile dysfunction, female sexual dysfunction, and female infertility with the first inklings of revenue although it was curtailed by Covid. They are awaiting FDA approval of their Investigational New Drug application in order to start clinical trials for their stroke recovery therapy and should receive it around the end of the month. They are moving into clinical trials on their degenerative disc disease therapy that does not require FDA approval, but they are conducting it along FDA guidelines and will publish the findings in peer-reviewed journals.  Executives are top-shelf and have experience selling biomed startups to big pharma. Medical advisory board is world class. Float of 577M is tiny for an OTC, and they performed a 150:1 reverse split last year to clean up their structure in preparation for a listing upgrade.

65,DMAC," Hey, thanks for this. I'm going to have a whisky and give a toast to your good fortune.

Can you elaborate at all about moving averages? I'm using Fidelity's Active Trader Pro software with a customized layout. There's a Technical Analysis drop down above the chart, and I've recently begun using support and resistance lines -- though, fustratingly, they aren't available for all stocks, and they aren't available at an interval less than ""Daily.""

Anyway, I'm looking at Patterns & Events, Indicators, in there and I see a Double Moving Average Crossover-DMAC, Price Crosses Moving Average-MAC, and Triple Moving Average Crossover-TMAC in there and was wondering if you had a good academic recommendation on the topic.

I can just look at the related text, which is intimidating enough, but things get really crazy when I add them to the chart. I get respective colored lines for SMA(4), SMA(9), SMA(18), SMA(21), SMA(50), DMAC, and TMAC. Honestly, it's nearly gibberish to me. I assume the numeric values have something to do with a number of days, and the ""MA"" part is ""Moving Average"" but that's about it.

If you're busy, no worries. I'll fuck off and (probably) come around to understanding eventually. Your post is excellent, so I really appreciate that.

A lot of messages asking for the videos, its simply ‚Äúdifference between swing trading and day trading‚Äù on youtube lol

I recommend a lot of you learn the basics and how to be consistently profitable before going in with bigger sizes, trying to daytrade, etc.

Basics include how to read candles, RISK MANAGEMENT, support/resistance.

Go in small like 1-2% of your account or paper trade until you start learning patterns, etc. the goal is to be consistent and compounding, taking profit, and growing your account.

I like SMB capital videos on youtube, ‚Äúhow to be a consistently profitable trader‚Äù

89,NES," I remember a few years ago, Nintendo released a mini NES console with a bunch of digital games. I bought it for the nostalgia because i used to love playing NES back when i was a kid.

By today's standards, the games are completely frustrating and unpleasant. So are gameboy games, so is even Goldeneye on the N64, which was legendary back in its day.
I'm sure playing old Atar games is as fun as watching paimt dry

I mean even if Atari makes new games available on their console, why would anyone buy Atari instead of PlayStation or Xbox? No cross play on platforms means online experience will be awful as the majority of people game on PS or Xbox or PC. Most people in their 30s will not buy a second console for 400 bucks just for the nostalgia and teenagers and people in their 20s won't buy Atari period. And let's be real, if you buy an Atari for the nostalgia alone, you will play a total of 30 mins and then never again.

122,AI," I ignored their outstanding shares and foreign fee on Fidelity when purchasing. There are three big reasons this was a have-to-buy and hold for me:

1) They sell solar power to their military for funding, and the military will never go anywhere so that funding shouldn't either.  
2) Wave Energy doesn't theoretically have major weaknesses such as solar and wind, and we get the added bonus of not having to use 'precious land' to build on.  
3) They got a Microsoft AI to help with wave prediction (imagine being able to know when a tsunami is coming and integrate warning systems).

I know they might not actually go anywhere, but I believe they've done a good job of turning themselves around from a rocky start and have a solid goal in mind. The one thing I'm not incredibly happy with is they don't expect to see ""major profitability"" until \~2050, meaning this can be a \~30-year hold depending on what you want out of this.

136,DD," This being my first post here, I apologize in advance if my etiquette is off, but I'll do my best to share my DD. I bought 740 shares of $ROYTL at .13 because I was looking for a penny stock to yolo $100 on. I found this one through Firstrade's stock screener. The basic numbers seem good, low market cap of $5.4 million with only 38.58 million shares outstanding. Revenue of 14.01 M, net income of 12.61 M, with a P/E ratio of 0.46. Earnings per share currently listed at $0.33. Numbers found here:¬†https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/roytl/

The only red flag I can find is that I can't find the red flag. I see that they got kicked off the NYSE for the stock price being below $1 for too long, but I can't seem to find any news that explains why the price dropped so much, other than they stopped paying dividends, or why it has stayed so low despite being profitable. Perhaps just the stigma of being a penny stock? Some shady practices I'm missing? The 90% profit ratio seems almost too good to be true. Maybe if they start paying dividends again the price will skyrocket or maybe they've given up and it's just a dud. It's my first penny stock, so I know it's a big risk. Just trying to learn.

141,PT," Is there any example of why I wouldn't want to sell covered calls at my price targets?

EX: I own 500 shares of stock A @ 1 dollar. There is an upcoming catalyst for this stock that will take place in 1 month.

For the purposes of this example, if the stock hits the catalyst, the predicted price should hit 3 dollars. Future catalysts could have this stock valued at 10 dollars down the road if they hit.

I plan to look to secure some profits after the first catalyst. Maybe I'm a little less optimistic and have a PT of 2.5. I'm going to sell 200 shares at this price no matter what just to lock in some profits.

Why would I not then, just sell 2 covered calls at a strike price of 2.5?

If the stock doesn't hit it, fine, I pocket my premium. If the stock hits 2.5 and keeps going past my target, oh well, my plan was to sell at 2.5 anyway, and now I have the added premium.

156,IT," I wouldn't say that penny stocks have a limited downside. You wanna win big? Then you have to buy thousands of shares of penny stocks. When it hits, IT HITS.

But when there's a correction, penny stocks are the first to TANK. Then it becomes an UPHILL battle to get out of penny stocks. 

Also, many penny stocks are scammy companies, defunct companies, or sketchy ones...it's actually more RISKY if anything.

I buy penny stocks because large market caps don't move quickly enough for me whereas penny stocks are fast movers.  When large market cap moves, I may gain a few bucks or a few hundreds if I put in thousands but to me that's  torture (my risk tolerance is higher than others) waiting months/years for that to happen.

Holding 18505 shares @ $2.097

&#x200B;

Edit:

Thought i'd offer some other insights into the company.

The companies financials are audited by the tier 1 auditing and accountancy firm Ernst & Young

The CEO Min Luo stated years ago on Qudian's IPO that his intentions was to acquire multiple businesses and he's stuck to that plan

The CEO Min Luo and founder owns a 25% stake in the company. This equates to $165M USD at current price value.

In the year 2019 it made nearly 1 Billion USD, yes, US DOLLARS in PROFIT for that year.

The company has remained in a positive earnings throughout covid yet the price of the stock dropped

Short interest for the stock has heavily weakened over the recent weeks/months

Vanguard, Blackrock, Goldman Sachs and other big hedge funds have been aggressively buying QD around the $2.50 - $1.30 range

The book value of this stock is around $6 - $7 per share and the company is profitable

&#x200B;

I could keep going but you get the idea..
