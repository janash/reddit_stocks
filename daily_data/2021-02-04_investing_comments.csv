Its price action is quite correlated to the IPAY, actually with a slight beat over the past year (IPAY has done better in more recent periods), yet the expense ratio is much less, 40bps vs IPAY's 75bps. It even has a 71% overlap by holdings with the IPAY As I see it, TPAY is in effect a discount IPAY that's actually outperformed. What's not to love?

The main issue I see with it is that it's tiny, with VERY low liquidity. But you'd think that with its performance and fee, it would have getting more love.",ohsureguy,1,/r/investing/comments/lcftzc/10_interesting_and_useful_etfs_with_less_than_1b/gm0z3uq/,0.093,0.881,0.026,-0.8086

16,USA," Honestly, my play on cannabis in the US is just Altria (MO). They already mass mass produce and distribute rolled cigarettes, cigars, pipe tobacco, and e-cigs/vapes on a national scale, and all of their resources—the machining/tooling, supply/distribution, existing contracts with retailers, financial resources, lobbyists, and established market presence—will translate very well to cannabis. They also own stakes in wine and alcoholic beverage manufacturers which can help smooth their transition into other cannabis products such as infusions and edibles. 

They're this giant behemoth lurking behind all the local one off and regional cannabis distributors waiting to pounce as soon as marijuana is legalized federally, they've been buying up cannabis related branding for years, they own a large share in Cronos Group, and undoubtedly have a game plan for legalization—they won't be getting caught with their pants down on this one. They have the the size and money required to squeeze out any competition from these smaller players who are currently the predominant distributors, and know how to use lobbyists and political pressure to benefit them. 

I don't think that the federal legalization of marijuana will be a win for the ""little guy"". I think that big tobacco is going to come through and demolish them unless laws are put in place specifically to prevent that from happening. The product is just too similar and they have too many resources. 

One caveat I would make is that in recent years they spun off their subsidiary Philip Morris International, which handles the manufacturing and distribution of their products (eg Marlboro) outside of the USA, which makes them more of a domestic play in my mind. The flip side is that the USA is far more progressive on cannabis than other modern developed countries (excluding Canada), and it's likely to be legalized here first, so their domestic focus could also be seen as an upside.",ThatsWhatSheErised,4,/r/investing/comments/lcftzc/10_interesting_and_useful_etfs_with_less_than_1b/gm0pyzy/,0.012,0.916,0.072,0.9538

24,MO," I get where you are coming from but a couple thoughts:

&#x200B;

1. The term ""legalization"" is getting used a lot and I think we need to define what that means. Broad federal legalization (which was proposed in the MORE Act which passed the House in late 2020) would legalize cannabis at a Federal level which would drop barriers on inter-state commerce and allow for a true national industry like in almost every other consumer product. In this world, yes, big tobacco and big alcohol (and maybe others) will be big players. I anticipate they will enter the market via acquisitions. Said differently. If/when we get federal legalization, all of the US MSOs become M&A targets overnight (not a bad outcome as an investor). But...
2. The MORE Act, or a similar version, is highly unlikely to pass in the next few years, and I've heard several cannabis insiders say they don't think it will pass even in 10 years. What is more likely to pass is a version of the STATES Act which decriminalizes cannabis at the federal level and pushes the decision to legalize down to individual states. If you parse the language Schumer has been using, he's been talking a lot about decriminalization vs. broad legalization. In this scenario, I'm not so sure we will see big tobacco or big alcohol make a meaningful push. Rather, I see any participation coming in the form of strategic investments in the winners (AYRWF, GTBIF, TCNNF, CURLF, CRLBF, CCHWF, etc). So...
3. While I think the LT view you articulated on MO makes sense, they are not going to be the most direct beneficiaries over the next few years. The most direct beneficiaries will be the well-capitalized, vertically integrated US MSOs. I think its important to point this out because while cannabis has a long runway for growth (10+ years), we are at a really unique inflection point in the industry's evolution where the MSOs are going to see big gains off of the bottom driving a level of revenue growth and cash generation that will catch a lot of folks and institutions by surprise and should translate to meaningful share price appreciation. I want to be there for that which is why I am bullish the stocks and the MSOS etf",afrostud01,2,/r/investing/comments/lcftzc/10_interesting_and_useful_etfs_with_less_than_1b/gm0s6wv/,0.026,0.839,0.134,0.9918
25,CGC," MJ doesn't have a single US MSO in its ETF vs. MSOS which is mostly US MSOs. MJ mostly Canadian players, the cannabis services companies (which are good businesses, but overvalued like GRWG), and some players viewed as part of the ecosystem even though they don't have much exposure today (like tobacco).

The US MSOs are the most direct beneficiaries of all the positive trends in the US (both fundamental and regulatory), and most of the good ones have superior growth and margins vs. the Canadian operators and are trading very cheap relative to the CGC/APHA/TLRY's with several catalysts on the horizon. When you look at any of the cannabis ETFs, look for names like AYRWF, TCNNF, GTBIF, CRLBF, CURLF, CCHWF, TRSSF, JUSHF, RWBYF.

30,MO," You raised a number of good points that definitely need to be considered. 

I think that right now the country is at a political crossroads, and it’s possible that a new wave of young liberal voters will push through cannabis legalization sooner than we expect, especially if the Democratic Party uses their current position to solidify their longer term political power. However, I think the scenario you outlined is a lot more realistic, and maybe it would be more appropriate to view MO as a long term play and a short-mid term hedge against unexpected legalization while you look to benefit from US MSOs in the meantime.",ThatsWhatSheErised,2,/r/investing/comments/lcftzc/10_interesting_and_useful_etfs_with_less_than_1b/gm0v75k/,0.0,0.861,0.139,0.9186

Basically an etf is a basket of stocks, to find the value of the etf you add up it's assets. The nav is the totaling of it's assets. A share price higher than a nav means you're paying a premium to own those shares. This is very very over simplified.

35,RC," I bought in at 330 and then again at 280 for a 307 average. I've got a good amount of savings to cover me, but will have to explain my losses... My thinking was ""If I lose this, it sets me back 2-3 years. If I win this, life gets a LOT easier moving forward."" Worth the risk. 

I still think I was right in the decision to FOMO buy; I bought a day before the big jump to 500. But I was absolutely wrong to trust the echo chamber and not sell when we saw the whole system turn against us. Once RH and other brokers restricted buying for more than one day I should have pulled out. The day before it dropped to 181 closing I still would have made a profit if I sold in the morning. 

An extremely expensive lesson and currently I'm just going to hold the stock. It seems reasonable that the price may go higher than the current 77 if RC and his team turn the company around - the money I get from selling now won't make a huge difference to me in the short term anyway. 

Sucks ass though, but I learnt something about myself. And now I get to look at those numbers everyday and say, ""You little shit, this was your mistake. How are you going to make up for it? No more of wasting your time and day, it's time to live life properly. PUSH yourself god-dammit!""

A lot of the recent surge was fueled by a solid TSLA investment in 2019. I’ve had dips but by and large I was investing in companies I believe strongly in and ETFs. I’m 31. I say this because while I'm not overly sophisticated I don't think I'm a complete idiot investor either. Most of my positions have been long (things like Netflix, Constellation Software, Tesla until a recent sale).

I heard about GME and what was happening on January 26th, yet I didn’t step into the ring until the 27th. I bought in the morning, sold in the evening. Only a few shares (because I really didn’t grasp what was going on) and I made myself about $350. Nothing significant at all but good for the day, as I had joked that I wanted to get in on the roller coaster and say that I at least took part a little bit as the news was coming out.

I made the mistake of spending most of the evening on the 26th reading the hype and expectations and trying to understand the short position. Mistake number one here was that I didn’t have the full picture. I was coming in at hype-train peak. I missed out on the overnight gains between 26th and the 27th and instead bought in when the market opened on the 27th, convinced there might be a surge on Friday.

Still, convinced that things were going to happen in the next 48 hours, and worries about my loss (at this point only about 3.5% of my portfolio on the line, I started to average down.

When all was said and done I put about 7% of my portfolio into GME and AMC, chasing the knife as it fell. I had points where it surged back up and was profitable. As I was chasing, I kept telling myself once it surged back I would sell and get out. Only every time I was in a position to do so, instead of trusting my plan I got greedy. “It’ll go a little higher. I just need to hold a little longer.” It didn’t. Price fell again.

I think after I make this post I’ll sell my position, having lost about 5.5% of my portfolio value. In the grand scheme of things, since this is money I won’t touch until I’m 65, it’s a lesson worth learning and a cautionary tale.

Up to this, I always did my DD in researching potential investments. I've worked hard to build my portfolio over the past 7 years and ultimately compromised my own values going in on this.

44,GME," One thing that I'm looking at in the charts right now is that GME seems to be consolidating around the 21-day moving average.  So, when looking at it through the lens of a growth stock, it means it wouldn't be too crazy to think that GME might go on a long-term run if it finds actual support there.

The crux of the matter here is whether you'd want to consider GME to *be* a growth stock or not.  IMO (and obviously this is not investment advice), with their recent board acquisitions and Microsoft deal, their lack of debt, and their triple-digit increase in online sales (and renewed focus on that aspect of the business), it makes me think that it can be considered as such.

Of course, this means that people who bought in at $400/share would have to wait a year or two before they're in the green again.  But I think it'll get there.

$90/share is still too undervalued for GME over the long term.  Again, just my opinion, no one knows that I'm actually a dog on the internet.",Existential_Owl,4,/r/investing/comments/lcc24v/gamestop_big_picture_evolution_of_a_trade/glzpzbx/,0.037,0.885,0.078,0.6844

46,GME," > Also, while it turned out very well, I have to be completely intellectually honest and admit that I could have lost it all too. This was a crazy volatile trade with more twists and turns and unexpected developments than I could have imagined, and that's even given that I actually believe it when I say that I don't know what will happen next.

It's nice to hear this from someone who seems to know their stuff. I've been thinking about this GME thing for a while now and I feel incredibly torn. I felt stupid at how easy it was to get sucked into the hype and the big ""fuck the hedgies"" movement even though at the beginning this was purely a once-in-a-lifetime, get-rich-quick opportunity with no political movement behind it at all. (Let's be honest here, a group of individual retailers will never be able to take down Wall Street). All that hype almost encouraged me to put too much money in, which would have been a very, very stupid decision.

On the other hand, this has been a life-changing learning experience for me. I managed to get out of this with a nice profit and I'm now looking at using most of those profits for long-term investments. I've learned so much about the Stock market in just a couple of weeks and I think my experience with this whole GME thing can help aid my decisions in the future.

But I'm lucky. I got in early, and I got out in good time. I find myself lurking WSB a lot now which isn't good. The whole sub makes me incredibly sad and angry. Seeing *thousands* of people in a state of denial and suppressed regret is awful. I don't doubt that this movement to ""take down the hedge funds"" is now putting money right into their very bank accounts with GME being shorted again. I'm really worried that we'll be hearing about some suicides in the news in the coming weeks all due to this and it will probably go down as another dark blotch on Reddit's history, along with the Boston Bombers debacle.",charlesnew1,2,/r/investing/comments/lcc24v/gamestop_big_picture_evolution_of_a_trade/gm05wyx/,0.102,0.769,0.129,0.8663

If you have large Tax gains on options that expired (in the money) pre 2021. Make sure you end up with enough cash to pay the large amount of taxes you owe. The way this has occurred, many option investors may have gains they need to pay taxes on in 2020 and losses they will likely never be able to deduct in 2021 and going forward.

51,GME," I didn't jump on the GME train as I'm quite new to the world of shares, and knew that I didn't understand enough about it to make sound decisions. I've been investing in funds for a while now though, and had been *meaning* to get into shares, but just hadn't gotten around to it. So this whole weird GME freakshow has been an excellent catalyst for me to get learning more about shares in general, and dip my toe in with a few initial buys elsewhere. 

It's been so interesting to watch this whole thing from the sidelines (and far away - I'm in NZ). And not just for the market and investing discussions, but also for the social aspects and comparisons one could draw between this and the recent political upheaval in the US. The power of meme culture is immense, and the implications of that can be quite scary.

52,OR," Noob here. I was in for the cause to kill Melvin Capital. Bought at 300. Then today, I checked what types of shorts Melvin Capital bought. I saw that it's PUT orders. Then I researched what PUT orders mean and I found a video explaining it. I understood that PUT options are kind of ""insured"" orders. You pay a fee (premium) for your order. Let's say 1$, you set a price at which you want to sell the option, like let's say 10$ in 1 year. If the stock now never goes below 10$ during that year, you don't have to buy or sell the stock, instead, your option will simply expire meaning you will only lose the premium. This would mean that Melvin Capital will never have to buy the 140% shares to pay back those they borrowed, they'll just lose a lot of money on premiums. OR NOT?

57,GME," Here's the evolution in mental gymnastics the pumpers had. 

Last week:

1. GME is different has over 100% short interest
2. Hedge Funds that own the stock won't back out because they like the stock
3. Also retail this isn't about fundamentals anymore to the moon!

Let’s say a whale.. a HUGE whale. Elon size.. decides to buy up the remaining float when the share price gets low enough... 

1.. Why would someone/firm do that if they did? (as in what would the benefit be to them?

2. Would that effectively squeeze everything else almost immediately?

I ended up dumping in 18k at a cost basis of 230 or so. Managed to leave with my shirt on premarket on Friday.

I profited, but I don't see it as an 'intelligent success'. The only reason I won is because I got a grip on my emotions at precisely the right time, with exogenous factors like elon tweeting and RH allowing trades at precisely the right times to push me into profit.

Do you think Gamestop will be a bigger company than it was in 2008? Right before the recession, when online shopping was a fraction of what it is today, when people actually had to buy discs for their consoles, and when people actually shopped in malls still, it was a $60 stock. 

Now they're competing for the sale of physical games with online retailers who can beat them on price and speed, and physical games are declining anyways with people being able to just digitally download their games on their platforms.

Even an optimistic take on gamestop should have them with much smaller market share than they had in their heyday.

Prior to last month GME never traded above 60. And that's when it's business model made sense. It spent most of last year trading at 4. Near year end it reached 15 - that's probably the ""true"" value of GME.

66,GME," GME will take decades to go back to 307. 

You should get out now and put that money into something like QQQ. Let’s say you have 1 share at $307, and you sold today for $55, your loss would be $252. 

If you used that $55 from selling to get a partial share of QQQ you could get your money back in probably 8 years.

72,GME," They are absolutely not guess work (or they shouldn’t be if you’re doing it right), but they always come with risk.

Success rate on high risk plays like GME?  maybe 1 out of 3 or 4? Not enough data points to be meaningful really, as this is a super unusual event. On the actual investment in GME on that momentum play I essentially 25x’d or better (but only risking 20% of my capital, meaning the overall account “only” 6x’d).

The key is not success rate but overall risk asymmetry and very good risk management.

You can even come out ahead with a 10% win ratio if you’re making consistent, rational, and disciplined 20x plays with tight risk management practices.

As I saw in an analyst take somewhere, the loss of high-margin brick-and-mortar physical used sales is a huge concern.

Of course, I can understand the YOLO play, if it makes up .5% of your portfolio it's a good idea.  Many institutional investors did just that.  Also, if you still think the squeeze is possible then keep holding.

However, if you think the squeeze is done and are still holding onto GME under the guise that it has long-term appeal ... You are wrong.

We can also assume Apple wouldn't allow Canoo to compete with their own product so of course they would prefer acquisition.

1. They are either resolute in their subscription model and are single mindedly focused on that one play. Pretty bold move considering you're trying to disrupt a business model that has been the norm for decades. Seems a big risk thinking a subscription model is the way of the future when no one has succeeded yet. BMW and Audi are shuttering their efforts. Volvo and Porsche have had limited success.

2. Maybe they already signed a contract with Hyundai which would prevent the transaction? 
3. Both 1&2

152,CEO," Let me give my 2 cents based on my years of experience working in the mobile industry.

The biggest problem Nokia has been having for years has to do with their promoting and management culture. Nokia is extremely risk-averse and are so afraid of change. Afraid of trying out new ways and going after new opportunities and they keep on missing chances. Even when they are obvious. Anther CEO is likely not going to change that. Definitely not in the short term.

Most of the Nokia leadership has been working at Nokia or in the industry for decades. It’s really hard to teach an old dog new tricks. They have become so narrow-minded and so risk averse that they are afraid to change or seize opportunities.

The market is not happy with Nokia and has not been happy with them for a while. Because they do not seem to monetize on the opportunities in the industry. They have 0% growth in Europe, while they had have so many chances to get more European contracts due to the Huawei security concerns.",PlanetGuy,2,/r/investing/comments/lcgbyl/nok_q4_2020_earnings_eps_beaten_by_2967/gm14oh7/,0.084,0.808,0.108,0.5817

173,GME," I totally understand your concerns regarding this topic. In the end, it is a somewhat calculated gamble. Maybe you are lucky and will sell at the peak or buy on the dip, but the majority of times you are somewhere inbetween. The important thing is, always look back to the trades and investments and see if your assumptions were correct or where you made a mistake. 

My own example just happened with GME ofc. I was lucky to invest early when price was around $40 and red about 3 weeks into GME before placing my investment. I could have cashed out about $12k if I would have sold on the peak, $8k to $10k if I sold on friday at around $250-$350. But I dug so deep into the DD's for GME that I really believed it would hit >1k per share. Which, in my opionion, would have happened if brokers worldwide would not have restricted buying. At this point, I should have realized that $500 was the squeeze peak and that all the little dirty tricks HF's played in this game were effectively stopping the share from going higher. I sold at around $140, which still made me around $3.6k, but it could have been more. 

In the end, I'm happy about the quick money, but feel a bit ashamed that I was so blinded by my own greed. So I'll leave you with the saying: ""No one ever gets poor from taking some protifts.""",Leo1337,12,/r/investing/comments/lbz7fa/losing_massive_unrealized_gains/glx469s/,0.097,0.798,0.105,0.4706
174,GME," I’m not gonna answer your questions 1-4 individually because it wouldn’t be a cohesive response but this topic in general is what I’ve thought about too. 

The most reassuring answer is that you can’t time selling at the peak. 

Just recently out of this GME thing I made $45k but if I sold everything at the peak I could have made $90k. That hurts. But how many people can actually manage to time the market and sell at peak? No one knows what the peak is until it’s gone. 

The best way is to keep selling a % of your shares if you want to get some solid gains. Yes you could have made more but you could have made less too. All depends on timing. 

You sell based on the information you have in front of you. Not with hindsight. 

In my GME scenario I sold 25% of my stock @ $150 to get my initial investment out. So everything else was profit. The next day? Shares went to $300. Who could have known?!?

Then I sold 50% more in between $310 and $350 and kept the rest for even more gains as I was greedy. And still am. Holding 10% of the shares still...",TheReal-Tonald-Drump,6,/r/investing/comments/lbz7fa/losing_massive_unrealized_gains/glxlvn8/,0.043,0.797,0.159,0.9788
175,IMO," Selling a stock is like selling a car. If you don't have some idea what the car is worth you're not going to know when an offer comes in that you can't refuse or when you're being ripped off. And if you knew what your car is worth why would you be asking people on Reddit what price you should sell your car for?

Personally I'll sell a stock when I think the risk of not selling grows too high (I think ther's more chance of losing money than making money), or when I think I could make more by selling and putting that money somewhere else. IMO these are the only two valid reasons to ever sell a stock.

Sometimes stocks can sell for more than you think they're worth and at other times you'll be able to buy stocks for less than you think they're worth. Your job as an investor should be to buy stocks that are undervalued and sell them for at least fair value (unless something better comes along).

Most stocks will trend up so you will rarely sell at the very top, but if you're selling to make anther good investment all that matters is your relative performance.

If you're looking for a strategy that might help I personally set limit sell orders on pretty much everything in my portfolio with the limit being the price I would start to feel uncomfortable owning the stock. This might help you detach from the emotion of selling a little, although I personally do it as a time management / convenience thing – I cba to check every stock in my portfolio every day to see if it's hit a price I want to sell it at.",kriptonicx,3,/r/investing/comments/lbz7fa/losing_massive_unrealized_gains/glxcmja/,0.023,0.857,0.12,0.9659
176,GME," A lot of really great advice here. But I would add a caveat: it really depends on your overall income and what the tax implications are, as well as the long term potential of the company you’re involved in versus the percent of gains realized over time.

1) For a stock like GME, it’s hopefully a short term play based on market particulars, so you’re willing to cough up a lot for taxes if you win big. And if you lose, well, you can use it for short term tax loss harvesting.

2) Consider your annual income and the tax implications regardless. As someone with a decent annual income, any gains I sell short term (even for major winners in the past few 6 months like NIO, PLTR, MRNA, and TSLA) need to be considered against the tax implications since I’ve only held them for 6 months (or fewer in the case of PLTR). Is it worth taking profit now or do I still believe in the potential of these companies to continue holding the stock to at least the one year plus one day mark (lowering the taxes on any sales significantly)?

3) For a stock your really believe in long term (others have mentioned big tech names), you might just want to hold long term and not sell for less than a year holding due to tax implications, unless there are major fundamentals that shift your view of that company. Others have already noted this.

4) If the WSB crew, for some miraculous reason, sends your stock, even one you believe in long term, up over 1000% in a week, well in that case it’s probably worth selling most of it since it will likely revert to the MA sooner rather than later after going parabolic, tax implications be damned.",MoonWalktoGotham,2,/r/investing/comments/lbz7fa/losing_massive_unrealized_gains/glxn4rq/,0.024,0.848,0.128,0.9816

As someone with a decent annual income, any gains I sell short term (even for major winners in the past few 6 months like NIO, PLTR, MRNA, and TSLA) need to be considered against the tax implications since I’ve only held them for 6 months (or fewer in the case of PLTR). Is it worth taking profit now or do I still believe in the potential of these companies to continue holding the stock to at least the one year plus one day mark (lowering the taxes on any sales significantly)?

3) For a stock your really believe in long term (others have mentioned big tech names), you might just want to hold long term and not sell for less than a year holding due to tax implications, unless there are major fundamentals that shift your view of that company. Others have already noted this.

4) If the WSB crew, for some miraculous reason, sends your stock, even one you believe in long term, up over 1000% in a week, well in that case it’s probably worth selling most of it since it will likely revert to the MA sooner rather than later after going parabolic, tax implications be damned.",MoonWalktoGotham,2,/r/investing/comments/lbz7fa/losing_massive_unrealized_gains/glxn4rq/,0.024,0.848,0.128,0.9816

181,FCF," So one thing to consider was that if you were the type to quickly sell your gains, you likely would've sold before the peak. Getting both the right time to buy in and the right time to sell exactly correct is always impossible to do consistently.

The most rational way you can trade is to set a price target for your stocks based on your assumptions about their future earnings and risks. Set certain price points you will increase or reduce the size of your portfolio based on price fluctuations, and update when new information is discovered.

For example, for LUMN, my Price targets have been as follows, assuming no new information that justifies a price increase/decrease:

<$9 strong buy

$9-11.50 Buy

$11.50-$13.50- hold

$13.50-$14.50- start reducing size of holdings

$14.50-$16 greatly reduce size of holdings to a low level

\> $16 sell all

I mostly followed this and I was able to buy in around $10, greatly increase size of holdings as it dropped below $9, and then sell mostly around $15 when it spiked last week, and then was able to partially buy back in at $12 when it dropped back down.

My rationale was that at <$9/share, this was almost guaranteed to paid off. That's 9 years of dividends, which I believe to be easily sustained by FCF and earnings to pay off. Then of course there's all the upside I found of them reducing debt, lower interest rates, cloud/fiber growth, etc.

Anything above $13.50 was outside of their price trends with current information, and there are known risks to the company. So as shares began to rise above this point I did start to sell, mostly getting out at $15",skilliard7,1,/r/investing/comments/lbz7fa/losing_massive_unrealized_gains/glx9xtd/,0.049,0.874,0.077,0.8511

I'm forcing myself to set stop losses or roll my options.  Rolling calls up is a fantastic way to stay in the game AND take profits.
I screwed up big and didn't do this with GME calls last week when I took profits early.  I didn't have a solid exit plan and it burned me because it was abrupt.  I was at work and I got emotional, then pulled the ripcord.  No excuse though.

I'm not letting myself forget it ever.  I missed out on between 30-60k. By not rolling up.

That's options focused.  If you're a stock person, sell your psoiton slowly in intervals and if you think it's going to run, leave 10-25% to skyrocket.

I tested this theory Monday and went against logic and good DD that I read on here   With GME and I felt I should have sold before close but instead I put a sell limit at 260 and it crashed the next morn and I lost 10k. That taught me an expensive lesson to not get attached to a stock emotionally. Even though that was profit off a $60 GME call I sold the week before it still hurt...I could have done a lot of fun things with 10 grand but you can bet your ass I won’t make that mistake again. Bottom Line is You have to have a quarterback mentality when it comes to trading and what I mean by that is you gotta forget what happened on that last play..you threw a pick 6 and lost a couple grand? Do not let that influence your next play. In the end profit is profit buddy dont live in the coulda shoulda woulda department.

188,GME," Thank you for posting this. This (and the other comments here) is exactly what I needed to read after kicking myself hard the past couple days for not cashing in my 200 shares of GME at the peak. Looks like the same thing happened to a lot of people, and I should appreciate the money I did make and the hard lesson I learned. I got too greedy/emotional and honestly drank too much of the WSB Kool-Aid reading through the GME threads while watching the stock ticker for two weeks straight. As others pointed out, WSB was how I heard about it so I figured I should keep listening to the hive mind even though all signs began to point towards a massive drop. Ah well!

197,DD," I probably shouldn't say this but I really get a rush off the market. If I didn't have massive losses and massive gains I wouldn't do it.

I like researching the company and doing DD. I have long terms, etfs and then a lot of things I just do for the thrill of it. So if there were no lows, there wouldn't be any highs for me. So to me, it doesn't matter much about unrealized losses.

198,UI," I sympathize!!!  Seeing big green percentages in my portfolio is more gratifying than realizing the gains and starting over at zero with the next buy.  

I try to counter the bias by keeping a watchlist of new ideas to get excited about (sometimes an opportunity to buy prompts me to finally take action on something I've known I ought to sell).  Also I try to make the decision to hold vs sell while looking at fundamentals / valuation, not at my gains or a moving price ticker or graph pointing to the moon. 

Unless there's specific news, I usually sell a few shares at a time in recognition of my inability to guess the exact peak, and I keep GTC orders on certain volatile positions where I'd be happy to take a huge gain expecting a quick reversal (*ahem* WSB-infected stocks). 

I do wish brokerages would have a UI feature to reset gains to zero, or to a consistent time horizon, for reporting on a dashboard (of course in reality the unrealized gains still exist, but it would help me focus on expected future performance instead of clinging to past gains or losses).",jaamkie3,1,/r/investing/comments/lbz7fa/losing_massive_unrealized_gains/glykllq/,0.016,0.822,0.162,0.9697

meaning you do not lose the stocks due to normal daily fluctuations, but surely you will get rid of them and realize profits once the limit is reached. 

since it was sort of a gamble anyways, you do not really lose anything BUT you make sure you realize profits. 

with long term holds , something you really believe in, you might consider averaging out on dips. meaning buy more when the price dips.   
that way you really get more returns on so,mething that will probably keep perform in he future. I would do this for companies like AAPL, TSLA or something that has tremdendous long term potential.   
me personally would stay away from call options or anything that adds additional risk in already volatile assets (inndivual stocks are per se riskier than lets say ETF´s or something) UNLESS you realy know exactly what you are doing.

201,GME," Take it as an opportunity to get even better at managing your finances, including slowly eliminating unnecessary expenses. You started from O once, so while you hold, consider the score 0-0 and start a ""new"" investment nest egg. Consider what you've learned from your last purchases, whether you bought or sold early, whether emotion took over logic. Write down everything you noticed, and you will become more aware of it. If you need a reminder, write on a sticky note by your laptop screen, or near wherever you are doing most of your purchasing, that reiterates those things that can be forgotten when the urge to ""gamble"" hastens your decision. Just to remind yourself to ""Think Twice"" will help you go through the checklist in your head to determine if your buy criteria has been met with this investment..

Most importantly, have a game plan, always be as many moves ahead as is efficient. Think about and make watch lists of different stocks in different industries, organize them so they are easy to go through when you want to check on them. Write down the share price and other data you may want at the time you thought of them, track how they do as you build your next investment deposit. Axe the losers, focus on the winners. Diversify yes, but also micro budget your investment funds. Maybe limit your gamble purchases to 5-10% of your total budget, so that when you feel like going all-in, you have a ceiling. If you are right, that's great! and perhaps you will be sad you didn't take a bigger chance, but you will be happier to have some gain, and perhaps a better understanding of what events and numbers and feelings gave you the confidence to know that was a good buy, and use that knowledge next time. If you win, add 5% to your all-in budget, if you lose, take 5% down. Create some sort of punishment-reward system that helps create balance within your life, keeping you, the investor, in check first of all. 

&#x200B;

While you hold, take the time as a chance to research, collect, and organize the information you find. If it is a stock you believe in, slowly bring down your average by buying the dips. You will learn in time how to get better at this. The fact that you are reaching out to learn more is a great start, and that you can admit you have a lot of room to grow is always a mentality to have, for it raises your personal ceiling (hopefully like GME/AMC etc.!).",Big-Kitty-75,1,/r/investing/comments/lbz7fa/losing_massive_unrealized_gains/glzcc3l/,0.035,0.797,0.168,0.9962

203,ATR," Whenever a stock I have has massive unrealized gains and there's a sudden dip I ask myself a few things.

- Why did the price dip? 
- Was there any negative catalyst to the loss?
- Was the stock overbought and this was a natural correction?
- Has the stock broken below a support?
- If so, was it over extended in terms of PE ration/market cap?
- Whats the moving average on this position?
- Is this sector experiencing a dive or just this stock?
- Whats the current ATR long term/short term?

From here I ask on the future of this sector or the company I picked

- Is this company likely to continue performing?
- Are there any upcoming potential catalysts?
- What revenue streams can or will this company tap into?
- Does this sector have opportunity for expansion and growth to sustain a price increase?
- For me its also important to understand other companies within this sector that could surpass a company in tech/revenue/innovation via some superior product or business plan. 
- This then makes me think of how big this sector is and if it can sustain multiple players bidding for contracts/customer dollars.


There's no clear answer to the question but I tend to look for logical signals, mostly towards the company's future and reasoning behind a sudden dip.",KayBliss,1,/r/investing/comments/lbz7fa/losing_massive_unrealized_gains/glzjgmo/,0.036,0.882,0.081,0.7514
204,ALL," For anyone interested in learning about being an effective long term investor and doesn't want to be a victim of Mr. Market and your own emotions, I recommend reading the intelligent investor by Ben Graham. Graham is considered by many as the father of valuing investing and was Warren Buffett's professor at Columbia School Business and personal hero. Buffett, the GOAT of investing credits Graham as the reason for his success and continues to reread this classic book on investing psychology at the ripe old age of 90.

Graham elegantly outlines the difference between the price of a stock and the intrinsic value of the company the stock represents. Many people continue to invest on pure speculation alone hoping to cash in on the next big trend or fad. They do this by completely ignoring cost and value and focusing instead on future products and services. For those unfamiliar with price and value discrepancies and the impact of ignoring these concepts, I recommend reading up on the dot com crash and great depression. Most intelligent people believe things such as EV and autonomous self driving cars are the future as is carbon free power grids and infrastructure. No business savvy person denies the potential of a company like Tesla and its disruptive impact on a number of companies and industries.

However there is a major difference between speculation and potential and inherent value. The price of Tesla stock and the growth of its service lines, cash flow, and revenue streams seem very stretched considering it is worth more than Ford, GM, Toyota, Honda, and Volkswagen combined but only sells a fraction of the vehicles of one of these competitors. In fact, the company commands a market cap greater than Berkshire Hathaway which the GOAT of investing (Buffett) spent decades to build and includes over 60 wholly owned companies including the largest rail road in the country (BNSF), a huge insurance business (Gieco), an energy enterprise (Berkshire Hathaway energy), a real estate empire, a consumer juggernaut (Dairy Queen and Fruit of the Loom), and a giant investment portfolio with house hold names like Coke, American Express, Apple, and Bank of America.

Investing in next gen companies at todays prices like Tesla today is foolhardy to say the least. Please do your homework if you plan to invest in things other than bread and butter market index funds. Even index funds are only as good as the indexes they track so please read up on the indexes your sector ETFs may be tracking to understand your risks. Also read up on your mutual funds and ask yourself if the expense ratios are worth the investment and if you are paying a team of investors to do more than track an index.

If you do choose to invest in individual stocks please invest in companies you believe have strong economic and competitive advantages or moats. Warren Buffett loves the term moat and statistics such as free cash flow, price to free cash flow, cash flow and revenue growth rates, price to book ratios, debt to equity ratios, and return on investment can help you decide if a company is worth the stock price. You will also need to spend alot of time reading about the companies you do choose to invest in as well as their competitors in order to maximize your returns and minimize your losses. Buying great companies today at fair prices will provide you superior returns as opposed to buying great companies at high prices its simple math. But to do this you will need to understand the psychology of investing and practice your investment convictions and patience. Anytime you buy a stock pretend you bought the whole company you invested in. You are unlikely to unload an entire company in 10 days after buying it and you should use the same approach with your investments.

All being said my advice is do your home work and dont listen to people who play on your emotions or fears. For those interested in some advice and dont wish to do any leg work invest in a simple low cost S and P 500 index fund or total market index fund. For those looking at ETFs that offer good returns and attempt to protect against market down turns I recommend investing in the SPDR Dow Jones ETF or Invesco Equal Weighted S and P 100 fund.

For those looking at actively managed funds that invest in companies with moats, engage in ESG practices, and engage in price and value discovery I recommend the parnassus core equity fund (expense ratio of 0.86%) and parnassus endeavor fund (expense ratio of 0.95%)

For those looking at individual stocks that are priced fairly, have moats, and are proven winners I recommend CMI DE, CAT, ETN, WM, RSG, MSFT, GOOGL, AMAT, TSM, KO, PEP, PG, COST, WMT, TGT, WMT, MCK, PFE, MRCK, JNJ, CERN, APD, BRK, ALL, PGR, BAC, TD, AXP to name a few. You can always buy Van Ecks MOAT ETF as well.

Good luck investing and be smart with your money. Every investor needs to have a margin of safety please do your own self reflections and come to your own educated decisions about how to grow your wealth and achieve your long term goals.",Professional_Set3188,1,/r/investing/comments/lbz7fa/losing_massive_unrealized_gains/glzmnca/,0.043,0.768,0.189,0.9993

Also read up on your mutual funds and ask yourself if the expense ratios are worth the investment and if you are paying a team of investors to do more than track an index.

If you do choose to invest in individual stocks please invest in companies you believe have strong economic and competitive advantages or moats. Warren Buffett loves the term moat and statistics such as free cash flow, price to free cash flow, cash flow and revenue growth rates, price to book ratios, debt to equity ratios, and return on investment can help you decide if a company is worth the stock price. You will also need to spend alot of time reading about the companies you do choose to invest in as well as their competitors in order to maximize your returns and minimize your losses. Buying great companies today at fair prices will provide you superior returns as opposed to buying great companies at high prices its simple math. But to do this you will need to understand the psychology of investing and practice your investment convictions and patience. Anytime you buy a stock pretend you bought the whole company you invested in. You are unlikely to unload an entire company in 10 days after buying it and you should use the same approach with your investments.

All being said my advice is do your home work and dont listen to people who play on your emotions or fears. For those interested in some advice and dont wish to do any leg work invest in a simple low cost S and P 500 index fund or total market index fund. For those looking at ETFs that offer good returns and attempt to protect against market down turns I recommend investing in the SPDR Dow Jones ETF or Invesco Equal Weighted S and P 100 fund.

For those looking at actively managed funds that invest in companies with moats, engage in ESG practices, and engage in price and value discovery I recommend the parnassus core equity fund (expense ratio of 0.86%) and parnassus endeavor fund (expense ratio of 0.95%)

For those looking at individual stocks that are priced fairly, have moats, and are proven winners I recommend CMI DE, CAT, ETN, WM, RSG, MSFT, GOOGL, AMAT, TSM, KO, PEP, PG, COST, WMT, TGT, WMT, MCK, PFE, MRCK, JNJ, CERN, APD, BRK, ALL, PGR, BAC, TD, AXP to name a few. You can always buy Van Ecks MOAT ETF as well.

Good luck investing and be smart with your money.

210,CERN," For anyone interested in learning about being an effective long term investor and doesn't want to be a victim of Mr. Market and your own emotions, I recommend reading the intelligent investor by Ben Graham. Graham is considered by many as the father of valuing investing and was Warren Buffett's professor at Columbia School Business and personal hero. Buffett, the GOAT of investing credits Graham as the reason for his success and continues to reread this classic book on investing psychology at the ripe old age of 90.

Graham elegantly outlines the difference between the price of a stock and the intrinsic value of the company the stock represents. Many people continue to invest on pure speculation alone hoping to cash in on the next big trend or fad. They do this by completely ignoring cost and value and focusing instead on future products and services. For those unfamiliar with price and value discrepancies and the impact of ignoring these concepts, I recommend reading up on the dot com crash and great depression. Most intelligent people believe things such as EV and autonomous self driving cars are the future as is carbon free power grids and infrastructure. No business savvy person denies the potential of a company like Tesla and its disruptive impact on a number of companies and industries.

However there is a major difference between speculation and potential and inherent value. The price of Tesla stock and the growth of its service lines, cash flow, and revenue streams seem very stretched considering it is worth more than Ford, GM, Toyota, Honda, and Volkswagen combined but only sells a fraction of the vehicles of one of these competitors. In fact, the company commands a market cap greater than Berkshire Hathaway which the GOAT of investing (Buffett) spent decades to build and includes over 60 wholly owned companies including the largest rail road in the country (BNSF), a huge insurance business (Gieco), an energy enterprise (Berkshire Hathaway energy), a real estate empire, a consumer juggernaut (Dairy Queen and Fruit of the Loom), and a giant investment portfolio with house hold names like Coke, American Express, Apple, and Bank of America.

Investing in next gen companies at todays prices like Tesla today is foolhardy to say the least.

Even index funds are only as good as the indexes they track so please read up on the indexes your sector ETFs may be tracking to understand your risks. Also read up on your mutual funds and ask yourself if the expense ratios are worth the investment and if you are paying a team of investors to do more than track an index.

If you do choose to invest in individual stocks please invest in companies you believe have strong economic and competitive advantages or moats. Warren Buffett loves the term moat and statistics such as free cash flow, price to free cash flow, cash flow and revenue growth rates, price to book ratios, debt to equity ratios, and return on investment can help you decide if a company is worth the stock price. You will also need to spend alot of time reading about the companies you do choose to invest in as well as their competitors in order to maximize your returns and minimize your losses. Buying great companies today at fair prices will provide you superior returns as opposed to buying great companies at high prices its simple math. But to do this you will need to understand the psychology of investing and practice your investment convictions and patience. Anytime you buy a stock pretend you bought the whole company you invested in. You are unlikely to unload an entire company in 10 days after buying it and you should use the same approach with your investments.

All being said my advice is do your home work and dont listen to people who play on your emotions or fears. For those interested in some advice and dont wish to do any leg work invest in a simple low cost S and P 500 index fund or total market index fund. For those looking at ETFs that offer good returns and attempt to protect against market down turns I recommend investing in the SPDR Dow Jones ETF or Invesco Equal Weighted S and P 100 fund.

For those looking at actively managed funds that invest in companies with moats, engage in ESG practices, and engage in price and value discovery I recommend the parnassus core equity fund (expense ratio of 0.86%) and parnassus endeavor fund (expense ratio of 0.95%)

For those looking at individual stocks that are priced fairly, have moats, and are proven winners I recommend CMI DE, CAT, ETN, WM, RSG, MSFT, GOOGL, AMAT, TSM, KO, PEP, PG, COST, WMT, TGT, WMT, MCK, PFE, MRCK, JNJ, CERN, APD, BRK, ALL, PGR, BAC, TD, AXP to name a few. You can always buy Van Ecks MOAT ETF as well.

Good luck investing and be smart with your money. Every investor needs to have a margin of safety please do your own self reflections and come to your own educated decisions about how to grow your wealth and achieve your long term goals.",Professional_Set3188,1,/r/investing/comments/lbz7fa/losing_massive_unrealized_gains/glzmnca/,0.043,0.768,0.189,0.9993
217,JNJ," For anyone interested in learning about being an effective long term investor and doesn't want to be a victim of Mr. Market and your own emotions, I recommend reading the intelligent investor by Ben Graham. Graham is considered by many as the father of valuing investing and was Warren Buffett's professor at Columbia School Business and personal hero. Buffett, the GOAT of investing credits Graham as the reason for his success and continues to reread this classic book on investing psychology at the ripe old age of 90.

Graham elegantly outlines the difference between the price of a stock and the intrinsic value of the company the stock represents. Many people continue to invest on pure speculation alone hoping to cash in on the next big trend or fad. They do this by completely ignoring cost and value and focusing instead on future products and services. For those unfamiliar with price and value discrepancies and the impact of ignoring these concepts, I recommend reading up on the dot com crash and great depression. Most intelligent people believe things such as EV and autonomous self driving cars are the future as is carbon free power grids and infrastructure. No business savvy person denies the potential of a company like Tesla and its disruptive impact on a number of companies and industries.

However there is a major difference between speculation and potential and inherent value. The price of Tesla stock and the growth of its service lines, cash flow, and revenue streams seem very stretched considering it is worth more than Ford, GM, Toyota, Honda, and Volkswagen combined but only sells a fraction of the vehicles of one of these competitors. In fact, the company commands a market cap greater than Berkshire Hathaway which the GOAT of investing (Buffett) spent decades to build and includes over 60 wholly owned companies including the largest rail road in the country (BNSF), a huge insurance business (Gieco), an energy enterprise (Berkshire Hathaway energy), a real estate empire, a consumer juggernaut (Dairy Queen and Fruit of the Loom), and a giant investment portfolio with house hold names like Coke, American Express, Apple, and Bank of America.

Please do your homework if you plan to invest in things other than bread and butter market index funds. Even index funds are only as good as the indexes they track so please read up on the indexes your sector ETFs may be tracking to understand your risks. Also read up on your mutual funds and ask yourself if the expense ratios are worth the investment and if you are paying a team of investors to do more than track an index.

If you do choose to invest in individual stocks please invest in companies you believe have strong economic and competitive advantages or moats. Warren Buffett loves the term moat and statistics such as free cash flow, price to free cash flow, cash flow and revenue growth rates, price to book ratios, debt to equity ratios, and return on investment can help you decide if a company is worth the stock price. You will also need to spend alot of time reading about the companies you do choose to invest in as well as their competitors in order to maximize your returns and minimize your losses. Buying great companies today at fair prices will provide you superior returns as opposed to buying great companies at high prices its simple math. But to do this you will need to understand the psychology of investing and practice your investment convictions and patience. Anytime you buy a stock pretend you bought the whole company you invested in. You are unlikely to unload an entire company in 10 days after buying it and you should use the same approach with your investments.

All being said my advice is do your home work and dont listen to people who play on your emotions or fears. For those interested in some advice and dont wish to do any leg work invest in a simple low cost S and P 500 index fund or total market index fund. For those looking at ETFs that offer good returns and attempt to protect against market down turns I recommend investing in the SPDR Dow Jones ETF or Invesco Equal Weighted S and P 100 fund.

For those looking at actively managed funds that invest in companies with moats, engage in ESG practices, and engage in price and value discovery I recommend the parnassus core equity fund (expense ratio of 0.86%) and parnassus endeavor fund (expense ratio of 0.95%)

For those looking at individual stocks that are priced fairly, have moats, and are proven winners I recommend CMI DE, CAT, ETN, WM, RSG, MSFT, GOOGL, AMAT, TSM, KO, PEP, PG, COST, WMT, TGT, WMT, MCK, PFE, MRCK, JNJ, CERN, APD, BRK, ALL, PGR, BAC, TD, AXP to name a few. You can always buy Van Ecks MOAT ETF as well.

Good luck investing and be smart with your money. Every investor needs to have a margin of safety please do your own self reflections and come to your own educated decisions about how to grow your wealth and achieve your long term goals.",Professional_Set3188,1,/r/investing/comments/lbz7fa/losing_massive_unrealized_gains/glzmnca/,0.043,0.768,0.189,0.9993
224,PGR," For anyone interested in learning about being an effective long term investor and doesn't want to be a victim of Mr. Market and your own emotions, I recommend reading the intelligent investor by Ben Graham. Graham is considered by many as the father of valuing investing and was Warren Buffett's professor at Columbia School Business and personal hero. Buffett, the GOAT of investing credits Graham as the reason for his success and continues to reread this classic book on investing psychology at the ripe old age of 90.

Graham elegantly outlines the difference between the price of a stock and the intrinsic value of the company the stock represents. Many people continue to invest on pure speculation alone hoping to cash in on the next big trend or fad. They do this by completely ignoring cost and value and focusing instead on future products and services. For those unfamiliar with price and value discrepancies and the impact of ignoring these concepts, I recommend reading up on the dot com crash and great depression. Most intelligent people believe things such as EV and autonomous self driving cars are the future as is carbon free power grids and infrastructure. No business savvy person denies the potential of a company like Tesla and its disruptive impact on a number of companies and industries.

However there is a major difference between speculation and potential and inherent value. The price of Tesla stock and the growth of its service lines, cash flow, and revenue streams seem very stretched considering it is worth more than Ford, GM, Toyota, Honda, and Volkswagen combined but only sells a fraction of the vehicles of one of these competitors.

In fact, the company commands a market cap greater than Berkshire Hathaway which the GOAT of investing (Buffett) spent decades to build and includes over 60 wholly owned companies including the largest rail road in the country (BNSF), a huge insurance business (Gieco), an energy enterprise (Berkshire Hathaway energy), a real estate empire, a consumer juggernaut (Dairy Queen and Fruit of the Loom), and a giant investment portfolio with house hold names like Coke, American Express, Apple, and Bank of America.

Investing in next gen companies at todays prices like Tesla today is foolhardy to say the least. Please do your homework if you plan to invest in things other than bread and butter market index funds. Even index funds are only as good as the indexes they track so please read up on the indexes your sector ETFs may be tracking to understand your risks. Also read up on your mutual funds and ask yourself if the expense ratios are worth the investment and if you are paying a team of investors to do more than track an index.

If you do choose to invest in individual stocks please invest in companies you believe have strong economic and competitive advantages or moats. Warren Buffett loves the term moat and statistics such as free cash flow, price to free cash flow, cash flow and revenue growth rates, price to book ratios, debt to equity ratios, and return on investment can help you decide if a company is worth the stock price. You will also need to spend alot of time reading about the companies you do choose to invest in as well as their competitors in order to maximize your returns and minimize your losses. Buying great companies today at fair prices will provide you superior returns as opposed to buying great companies at high prices its simple math. But to do this you will need to understand the psychology of investing and practice your investment convictions and patience. Anytime you buy a stock pretend you bought the whole company you invested in. You are unlikely to unload an entire company in 10 days after buying it and you should use the same approach with your investments.

All being said my advice is do your home work and dont listen to people who play on your emotions or fears. For those interested in some advice and dont wish to do any leg work invest in a simple low cost S and P 500 index fund or total market index fund. For those looking at ETFs that offer good returns and attempt to protect against market down turns I recommend investing in the SPDR Dow Jones ETF or Invesco Equal Weighted S and P 100 fund.

For those looking at actively managed funds that invest in companies with moats, engage in ESG practices, and engage in price and value discovery I recommend the parnassus core equity fund (expense ratio of 0.86%) and parnassus endeavor fund (expense ratio of 0.95%)

For those looking at individual stocks that are priced fairly, have moats, and are proven winners I recommend CMI DE, CAT, ETN, WM, RSG, MSFT, GOOGL, AMAT, TSM, KO, PEP, PG, COST, WMT, TGT, WMT, MCK, PFE, MRCK, JNJ, CERN, APD, BRK, ALL, PGR, BAC, TD, AXP to name a few. You can always buy Van Ecks MOAT ETF as well.

Good luck investing and be smart with your money. Every investor needs to have a margin of safety please do your own self reflections and come to your own educated decisions about how to grow your wealth and achieve your long term goals.",Professional_Set3188,1,/r/investing/comments/lbz7fa/losing_massive_unrealized_gains/glzmnca/,0.043,0.768,0.189,0.9993
231,AMD," Some thoughts:

- If you are picking more losers than winners (not saying you do) in a rising market you need to reevaluate the reasons and metrics for picking companies

- Build positions over time not all at once. If you buy 100 shares and it drops 20%, it won't be as bad as 1000 shares dropping the same amount. At that point you have options like buy more. My example is AMD. I bought some in the mid 80's. Bought more in the 90's. Went back down to the 80's so I bought more. I have 300 shares now but I want a big position overall (1000+ shares). I want to buy over a few years so I buy over a time period.

- Don't throw good money after bad. Just because it dropped 20% doesn't mean you HAVE to buy more. I call small positions tracking positions. It lets me track the stock to see more clearly the opportunity to buy more or to leave it alone

- If your reasons for buying the stock are no longer true, then consider selling.

- People dump big losses they want to get rid of at the end of the year because it's a tax mitigation tool. They also do this with big wins. Tax planning is arguably more important than the investments you choose.

- Are you getting paid while you wait? If you're collecting a healthy dividend that might be a reason for holding.

- Really try to pin down the reason why it's doing bad. It is the market, the industry or specifically the company? And why.

- You should designate a part of portfolio to growth stocks and part to value stocks. If you're swinging for the fences on every position, you might end up getting hurt.

- If you like to actively trade and YOLO you should set a budget for that, that you are willing to lose.",Captcha_Imagination,1,/r/investing/comments/lbz7fa/losing_massive_unrealized_gains/glzr387/,0.084,0.742,0.174,0.9823

236,GME," Read this entire thread for once, recovering GME addict here

I have been kicking myself for the past two days, thinking of course of the “could haves should haves”

It is my first time investing in the stock market, total noob, and thought I take some risks for once as I have seen all of these meme stocks make people crazy money at times

I’ve always been risk adverse when it comes to money, grew up kinda cash strapped, lots of debt, paycheck to paycheck, finally after many years of busting my ass and being ambitious, I’ve gotten to a comfortable place in life, house, kids, and low debt.

So I started to think it would be good to start making money on money just sitting at home or in my bank account, so I opened my first investment account and started looking at the basics on wikis and Reddit and here comes wsb.... well lo and behold I take some risk and invest into GME

Started out at $30s early January, bought a few and thought ok that wasn’t too bad and that if I could get a few bucks I’d be happy, then it jumped to $70 bought a few more at $69 and thought well I averaged down in case it comes back down and thought if only I can get a few more I’d be happy, we all know the story know, but my original plan was to get out at $130 on the way up, got greedy and cancelled my sell orders, or course at 350 I thought well I should get out, saw the AH and international markets and saw that thing go past $400 so I took off my new sells and was in it for the 1000k not a meme rhetoric....and yea we know how that went 

I am also a newish actual commenter/poster on Reddit, I’ve always just lurked without an account, but you can see my history, getting hyped up with all of the rhetoric in the sub and the media etc, not my finest moment for sure, I will make a couple of bucks which is profit, but looking at this thread I feel better about not being the only one that has human emotions and I guess greed is a biggie one I need to be conscious of and be happy that I will at least recoup my investment, I know a lot of people will not be in the same position which sucks 

I will take out from this experience a few points

-	Risk management
-	Trust myself and stick to the plan
-	Continue to find ways to maximize my money, even in the stock market, even though I do like to have a stash in case things turn sideways
-	Be comfortable with the amount being “gambled”

This was certainly a valuable lesson for me which thank god was with money I was somewhat confortable losing,  although tbh I’m not sure how to feel “comfortable” losing anything not even $20 

so if anyone has tips on not feeling terrible about losing money I’m all ears!

Edit: in the same note about still finding new ways to make money, I am interested to try out options, I’ve only done shares since that’s a bit easier to understand, I’ve gone though the basics in various websites, but I’m still struggling with the concept if anyone has any tips on the matter please feel free to share, thanks",Yeahprobablyabadidea,3,/r/investing/comments/lbz7fa/losing_massive_unrealized_gains/glzcogw/,0.076,0.775,0.149,0.9943

243,GME," This.

I started investing 3 weeks ago and instantly got so lucky with GME, but I was driven by so much greed to not take big profits and wanting even more.

I was lucky to invest early when price was around $40 and red about 3 weeks into GME before placing my investment. I could have cashed out about $12k if I would have sold on the peak, $8k to $10k if I sold on friday at around $250-$350. But I dug so deep into the DD's for GME that I really believed it would hit >1k per share. Which, in my opionion, would have happened if brokers worldwide would not have restricted buying. At this point, I should have realized that $500 was the squeeze peak and that all the little dirty tricks HF's played in this game were effectively stopping the share from going higher. I sold at around $140, which still made me around $3.6k, but it could have been more.

In the end, I'm happy about the quick money, but feel a bit ashamed that I was so blinded by my own greed. Also, I am very relieved as well that i can focus on something else now, cause GME have been my last 3 weeks, having no idea what I actually worked on all day during 8 hours homeoffice :D

Edit: thanks for all the replies, I feel a bit relieved to hear all your sides of the stories realizing I am not alone with that thought. Guess we all learned something. But honestly, if HF‘s didn’t manipulate small brokers, we all would have cashed big - or maybe we all would have greeded to 5k share price once it would have hit 1k :D",Leo1337,53,/r/investing/comments/lbz7fa/losing_massive_unrealized_gains/glx4r6u/,0.075,0.736,0.189,0.9909

267,APHA," Pasting this higher up:

APHA

Mkt. Cap: $4.46 bn

Price: $16.61

Shares: 268512944

TLRY

Mkt. Cap: $3.37 bn

Price: $26.22

Shares: 128527841

TLRY and APHA are merging, with APHA shares converting to TLRY at a ratio of .8381. New ticker will be TLRY. So

new Mkt. cap = (APHA Mkt. Cap) + (TLRY Mkt. Cap)

New shares = (APHA shares)*.8381 + (TLRY shares)

New price = (New mkt. cap) / (New shares)

So post-merger we now have:

TLRY

Mkt. Cap: $7.83 bn

Share price: $22.15

268,TLRY," Pasting this higher up:

APHA

Mkt. Cap: $4.46 bn

Price: $16.61

Shares: 268512944

TLRY

Mkt. Cap: $3.37 bn

Price: $26.22

Shares: 128527841

TLRY and APHA are merging, with APHA shares converting to TLRY at a ratio of .8381. New ticker will be TLRY. So

new Mkt. cap = (APHA Mkt. Cap) + (TLRY Mkt. Cap)

New shares = (APHA shares)*.8381 + (TLRY shares)

New price = (New mkt. cap) / (New shares)

So post-merger we now have:

TLRY

Mkt. Cap: $7.83 bn

Share price: $22.15

They are trading way higher than that because time has passed and the market see more value in both of them. I don't see that if they merge the stock price tanks to get back to the $3.8 billion. I think we are way north of that already. TLRY already trading at $7.83 billion per your numbers and current price. The market has already suddenly created $4.03 billion in market cap (7.83 TLRY - 3.8 the value of the combined company in the merger agreement). I respectfully disagree with you.

324,GME," Chamath has literally been using WSB and all his appearances on CNBC as just marketing fodder for his SPACs which have been making an absolute killing this year. His 100k he put into GME, even if it went to 0, netted him hundreds of times in returns in exposure alone. 

He's an incredibly smart salesman but I have yet to see one person who is well respected within the finance world, whether academically or professionally come out and say anything positive about the guy other than he's very opportunistic. If you have time, give a listen to the latest episode of Grant Williams podcast ""The Endgame"" where they briefly touch on Chamath and other things.

I never invested in Clover, but I feel like in the long run Virgin Galactic is going to be another dud. SPCE doesn't even send people to space.

342,EV," In my opinion, if you are going to invest in a legacy auto maker, Ford is the one. I do own some Ford shares for full disclosure and I will buy more tomorrow most likely.

Ford knows how to build popular vehicles with their F150 line and the Mustang. They are already producing some electric vehicles and are partnering with EV companies. I think Ford is definitely looking to innovate and is shedding some of the old school mentality that is holding back the legacy manufacturers. This is just my opinion of course and I admittedly love Ford vehicles.

It would not surprise me to see Ford pounce on whichever EV truck company looks to have the best platform and just buy the company for their platform and slap an F150 body on top of it and call it a day.

401,AMC," I'm sure this has been said already, and I hope this is the correct spot to post this. I'm not looking for advice, but this might be able to help some people…(I apologize for the length):

Like many others, I’ve been amazed and felt energized over the last weeks watching the events unfold over the whole GME situation (as well as AMC, BB, NOK, etc).

I feel like a good point that’s been made through all of this is that the Wallstreetbets community was able to uncover a massive inefficiency in the market. They brought to light the fact that some large hedge funds had over-shorted GME and the little guy brilliantly took advantage of it. Wall Street and much of the world was left stunned. They couldn’t believe that a bunch of individual investors were able to come together with enough buying power to rival a hedge fund and create a massive short squeeze.

Nevertheless, it was still a risky play for many new investors who simply jumped onboard without knowing much about the stock market and might lose a lot of money by the time this is over. (And I get it, for many people this was not about making money).

However, back to the earlier point. Near the end of a recent interview with CNN, Jordan Belfort (aka Wolf of Wallstreet) made similar comments about finding inefficiencies in the market. He felt that Redditors would be better off doing the same thing they did with GME but be more careful about the companies they pick. What he meant by that is to find good companies that may be undervalued, not simply pick companies just to spite Wall Street or short sellers. For new investors or maybe investors not willing to take as much risk, he felt this type of Reddit community strategy could have amazing potential (and so do I). Even Kevin O’Leary said that he loved the fact that more people were becoming financially literate due to the recent events. He also hoped the Reddit investing community would continue and be used in good ways.

I’ll give you an example. Personally, I’m not super comfortable with options trading, so I usually just stick to straight up stock trading. I simply try to find undervalued companies or inefficiencies in the market, and I’ve been happy with my returns over the years. Last September, I discovered that Methode Electronics (MEI) was trading around $27 a share. Based on my research and due diligence, I figured the stock should be trading for closer to $40 a share or more. Here’s how I determined that:

Some fundamentals based on the financial statements:

For the last few years, the company had a good cash-realization ratio (measures how close a company’s net income is to being realized in cash). A ratio above 1.0 is good, which MEI had for several years.

Return on equity was a healthy 16% and was more or less similar for the last few years as well.

Debt to equity was under 1.0 as well as the total debt ratio. The company also had good cash reserves in the event of a downturn, which was good considering we’re still dealing with the covid-19 pandemic.

Net profit margins were good hovering around 10%, the net worth ratio had been growing, and there were no red flags such as rapidly declining sales or earnings.

The P/E ratio was around 10 when historically it had been anywhere from 12 to 26. The price-to book ratio was also around 1.40.

More importantly, its earnings to net tangible assets ratio was 40% and its price to tangible book value ratio was about 3.30. For the last couple years, it had been between 3.50 and 6.00.

Determining an appropriate value:

So, I knew the company was fundamentally sound or at least had been stable during the past several years. Now I just had to determine a reasonable estimate of what the company was worth. If you figure out the discounted owner earnings from the last several years, you get a present value estimate of about $80-90 a share. (I assumed a 5-year growth rate of 8%, a discount rate of 5%, and a good margin of safety).

For those who aren’t familiar with owner earnings, you could also do a discounted free cash flow analysis and get similar results, but I recommend you learn about both and how to calculate them. Now, my own estimate of $80-90 a share could still be way off, but I’m just looking for an indication as to whether the stock could be undervalued. If the stock price were $27 and my estimate had been $30, I would have just moved on to another stock. In this case, I knew it had potential. Once I considered the present economic environment and other items, I settled on a present value estimate of about $40 a share.

I bought MEI at $27.50 and sold in late December at $36.87…or a 34% gain within 4 months (but since I’m in Canada, I get beat up on the currency exchange and my net profit was about 26%...I know, ouch). Also, it may not be an eye-shattering gain, but I’m happy with it. I could have even held out a bit longer since the stock did climb to about $42, but it’s now back down in the $39-40 range.

Could I have just been lucky with this trade? Absolutely, but I’ve done the same thing with others. I did my due diligence and researched the stock before buying it. I knew what I was getting into and I was comfortable with the risk. I’m also convinced this company might be a good candidate to own long-term, but I sold when I felt it was priced appropriately, and for now I’ll keep looking for other inefficiencies. All the information I used was also readily available to the average retail investor.

Finally, back to the original point. Imagine if the Reddit Stock or Wallstreetbets communities used their influence to uncover good companies that might be undervalued. I’m sure some contributors do all the time, but maybe now more people will take notice. I know I might search for weeks or sometimes months before I find a potential company that is reflecting an inefficiency, but it usually pays off once I find it. If more people were looking, we might be able to find these more often and all take advantage.

However, back to the earlier point. Near the end of a recent interview with CNN, Jordan Belfort (aka Wolf of Wallstreet) made similar comments about finding inefficiencies in the market. He felt that Redditors would be better off doing the same thing they did with GME but be more careful about the companies they pick. What he meant by that is to find good companies that may be undervalued, not simply pick companies just to spite Wall Street or short sellers. For new investors or maybe investors not willing to take as much risk, he felt this type of Reddit community strategy could have amazing potential (and so do I). Even Kevin O’Leary said that he loved the fact that more people were becoming financially literate due to the recent events. He also hoped the Reddit investing community would continue and be used in good ways.

I’ll give you an example. Personally, I’m not super comfortable with options trading, so I usually just stick to straight up stock trading. I simply try to find undervalued companies or inefficiencies in the market, and I’ve been happy with my returns over the years. Last September, I discovered that Methode Electronics (MEI) was trading around $27 a share. Based on my research and due diligence, I figured the stock should be trading for closer to $40 a share or more. Here’s how I determined that:

Some fundamentals based on the financial statements:

For the last few years, the company had a good cash-realization ratio (measures how close a company’s net income is to being realized in cash). A ratio above 1.0 is good, which MEI had for several years.

Return on equity was a healthy 16% and was more or less similar for the last few years as well.

Debt to equity was under 1.0 as well as the total debt ratio. The company also had good cash reserves in the event of a downturn, which was good considering we’re still dealing with the covid-19 pandemic.

Net profit margins were good hovering around 10%, the net worth ratio had been growing, and there were no red flags such as rapidly declining sales or earnings.

The P/E ratio was around 10 when historically it had been anywhere from 12 to 26. The price-to book ratio was also around 1.40.

More importantly, its earnings to net tangible assets ratio was 40% and its price to tangible book value ratio was about 3.30. For the last couple years, it had been between 3.50 and 6.00.

Determining an appropriate value:

So, I knew the company was fundamentally sound or at least had been stable during the past several years. Now I just had to determine a reasonable estimate of what the company was worth. If you figure out the discounted owner earnings from the last several years, you get a present value estimate of about $80-90 a share. (I assumed a 5-year growth rate of 8%, a discount rate of 5%, and a good margin of safety).

For those who aren’t familiar with owner earnings, you could also do a discounted free cash flow analysis and get similar results, but I recommend you learn about both and how to calculate them. Now, my own estimate of $80-90 a share could still be way off, but I’m just looking for an indication as to whether the stock could be undervalued. If the stock price were $27 and my estimate had been $30, I would have just moved on to another stock. In this case, I knew it had potential. Once I considered the present economic environment and other items, I settled on a present value estimate of about $40 a share.

I bought MEI at $27.50 and sold in late December at $36.87…or a 34% gain within 4 months (but since I’m in Canada, I get beat up on the currency exchange and my net profit was about 26%...I know, ouch). Also, it may not be an eye-shattering gain, but I’m happy with it. I could have even held out a bit longer since the stock did climb to about $42, but it’s now back down in the $39-40 range.

Could I have just been lucky with this trade? Absolutely, but I’ve done the same thing with others. I did my due diligence and researched the stock before buying it. I knew what I was getting into and I was comfortable with the risk. I’m also convinced this company might be a good candidate to own long-term, but I sold when I felt it was priced appropriately, and for now I’ll keep looking for other inefficiencies. All the information I used was also readily available to the average retail investor.

Finally, back to the original point. Imagine if the Reddit Stock or Wallstreetbets communities used their influence to uncover good companies that might be undervalued. I’m sure some contributors do all the time, but maybe now more people will take notice. I know I might search for weeks or sometimes months before I find a potential company that is reflecting an inefficiency, but it usually pays off once I find it. If more people were looking, we might be able to find these more often and all take advantage.

Finally sold my 2 GME shares earlier - the stress and time it was taking out of my day was not worth it.

&#x200B;

**Long story short, I'm 27 years old, currently jobless, and lost 15k of my 37k portfolio (savings) buying high and selling low. 23K of that money is unpaid, low interest student debt. I still don't fully grasp how I actually did this.**

&#x200B;

Ok, so it's wednesday, and I'm done with the initial tidal waves of self-hate and pain.  I guess at the moment I'm trying to make an incredibly expensive life lesson out of this. Other than accepting the loss, what else could I do? Except NOT take any more risks and trying to gamble the money I lost back – I have an impulse to do this. It might be the reason I am in this whole mess.

This is going to be a long post. Gonna go all the way my childhood, first 5k in savings and the cannabis rush of 2018 and losing 40k of value, and you know, almost gaining it back. Before this week. So, buckle up buddy boy, it's time to get brutally honest and probably die a little.

**Growing up** my family was quite poor, with first my father being a student and mother working, before both of them decided to become entrepreneurs.  Still I felt like we had everything, and for me that was pretty much some candy and an old PC, but we had no savings. My parents didn't come from money. I guess deep down I knew, I never wanted to burden my parents with any wants or needs.

 I always had this curious relationship with money. It's not that I wanted to buy anything, other than a new PC from parts every five years or so. I just wanted it. The money. I wanted it stashed in a safe place. I wanted to look at it. I wanted the security, I guess.

 So when I got my first student loan I blew it all on booze and drugs. I was in quite a dark place at the time. I didn't really understand what happened, actually still don't. I guess that's depression for you. I got better eventually and actually some good came from this reckless spending, as I didn't want to do that again.

&#x200B;

**This is where the investing part begins.** Two years later I inherited 5k from my grandfather, which for me, was so huge. So, no drugs this time, instead I started to learn about stocks. After a few bumps I actually got a good system down - and too-da-loo, it was index funds! 

I created a portfolio of different ETF's that closely followed a global world ETF with lower expenses.  I was quite proud of that. It was more work that way, but I quite I liked tinkering with my numbers and looking after my savings. Made me feel safe. 

However, there is a part of me that wants to gamble, get that quick money. And if I lost, instead of accepting the loss I wanted to double down. I had no understanding of value, only greed to get more, and fear of losing what I have, or had. All that just for the stake of having bigger numbers on the screen, as I had no plans of what to do with the money. I just wanted it.

Enter the first hype stocks. I read a lot of Finnish investing forums at the time. All my ""research"" was based on what was posted, and in most cases, not even the main posts, but the replies. So, given all that, I still managed to double my 750€ investment, or gamble in a certain stock, that isn't really relevant. And then I lost a few k chasing a falling dagger. Got out eventually. Stayed with indexes, and I was basicly set for life... if actually had stayed with that, I would have... man I don't even want to know.

&#x200B;

Enter.... **CANOPY GROWTH CORPORATION!**

 At the time, I had liked weed. In Finland, it's still illegal. All my friends smoked it regularly, yet I hard started to get anxious from it. Still I felt like I understood this movement, and the potential that comes with changing legal spaces. 

 So I got in time just for the green rush of 2018. I started out quite moderately, just with a few k in CGC, but seeing the gains, I started to invest more. I read all the napkin math from Reddit and soon I was all in... and my 20k from that time had become 50k! 

 I was... I'm not sure what I was feeling. It was too much, but I didn't know about bubbles, I felt like the hype was real, like soon I wouldn't have to worry about money anymore, like I would be worth something. I didn't know, how wrong investments could go... 

So, I guess we lost some of the napkins and some stocks went to zero. Luckily, mostof my money was in CGC and Aphria, as they were the biggest and to me, safest. I watched to eventful ride all down to 7k from the 50k. I was... I thought CGC and APH would recover, and in that, I was right. Still... well you all know how it feels to think about how you should sold at the peak. Took some time, but I got over it, thought I learned something, too.

&#x200B;

 **That was last March.** Luckily amidst the crash, I had taken some money out of my failing canadian weedstocks and moved into USA, still believing. I worked, saved, bough more cannabis stocks.

  
 And then, a week ago, I was back up to 37k.  Feeling really good, you know. I knew not to trust the hype. Unluckily money still had a hold on me. I regularly lurked /r/wsb. To me, it was amazing. I thought I understood, that for every winner there were a hundred losers, and the odds were stacked against me. It was entertaining to see people seemingly not care about losing money, when to me, it was so precious. 

&#x200B;

 **Well. GameStop.** 

I think it all started because I had 250€ waiting to be invested. I thought, hey, what the hell, let's take a little gamble.  I bought GME at 60€, and sold it at 50€. Ok, that sucked. Strangely I still feel the pain of losing that 50 euros. But then, I re-learned the lesson, that hype stocks weren't for me. 

Then two days later, GME is at 90, and still rising. WHAT! So I got just in time to buy at 150 and sell at 130. Bought in again at 100. Watched the graph like a hawk (like that did any good, wtf?), sold at 98. Lost 300€. Well that sucked. I did the same mistake again, what the hell is wrong with me? So, I swore off the hype stocks again. Forever. Told my girlfriend, that maybe I just hard re-re-learn that lesson. 

So, come thursday. I'm on Instagram and see a post about GME and go check out the price – 300??? WHAT! 

I feel the rush. I feel the mistakes I made selling. I see this opportunity, and feel like I still have a chance to make so much money, so much, that I won't have to worry about it anymore, not for a while, what with no job and all. I don't want to make any rushed to moves, and still... I do just that. 

I go online and sell all my CGC and Aphria (worth 13.5k) and buy GME @ 400. But see, I'm smart, this time I won't buy all at once. I buy more at 350. Great price, right? And I buy more at 300. The price drops to 250. I feel... panic... and buy more at 220. The day closes at 198. 

But I have learned my lesson, right? Every time I sold it was a mistake. So this time, I hold. My plan was to sell Friday, so I just had to hold for one day and then... we close at 328! But... we didn't skyrocket? I read /r/wsb and got high on hopium. 

On the weekend, away from the soul sucking graph, I start to realize that I'm in way over my head. Unluckily I still believe that I could get rich, but still decide to sell of atleast 8k of the 13k, because can't even sleep anymore. 

Come monday. I don't sell right away. I thought there would be a spike and bought more on the way down, with 3k more at 220. And well. Why the fuck did I do that. I couldn't admit loss. I thought I had learned my lessons, but I guess I learned the wrong ones and held. 

 I start to actually research this short squeeze. But I don't undestand. It's an echo chamber. And I'm one these fucking monkeys.

**So, tuesday comes, and the stock I sold, CGC and Aphria, have rose 20% in value. I sell.** 

I sell almost everything, just leaving enough that if GME goes to 1000, I break even. And today, I'm going to sell that too. There is no bull thesis anymore. The shorters have loaded up again, the hype is dead, yada yada, I don't know... I still actually do see a glimmer of hope. But that's what a gamble is, right? It's a load of shit with some yellow dust sprinkled on top of it. 

&#x200B;

 15k in losses, taking into account the money I lost with cannabis stocks climbing. Made me look into the value thesis of $ROPE.

 I was... I'm not sure what I was feeling. It was too much, but I didn't know about bubbles, I felt like the hype was real, like soon I wouldn't have to worry about money anymore, like I would be worth something. I didn't know, how wrong investments could go... 

So, I guess we lost some of the napkins and some stocks went to zero. Luckily, mostof my money was in CGC and Aphria, as they were the biggest and to me, safest. I watched to eventful ride all down to 7k from the 50k. I was... I thought CGC and APH would recover, and in that, I was right. Still... well you all know how it feels to think about how you should sold at the peak. Took some time, but I got over it, thought I learned something, too.

&#x200B;

 **That was last March.** Luckily amidst the crash, I had taken some money out of my failing canadian weedstocks and moved into USA, still believing. I worked, saved, bough more cannabis stocks.

  
 And then, a week ago, I was back up to 37k.  Feeling really good, you know. I knew not to trust the hype. Unluckily money still had a hold on me. I regularly lurked /r/wsb. To me, it was amazing. I thought I understood, that for every winner there were a hundred losers, and the odds were stacked against me. It was entertaining to see people seemingly not care about losing money, when to me, it was so precious. 

&#x200B;

 **Well. GameStop.** 

I think it all started because I had 250€ waiting to be invested. I thought, hey, what the hell, let's take a little gamble.  I bought GME at 60€, and sold it at 50€. Ok, that sucked. Strangely I still feel the pain of losing that 50 euros. But then, I re-learned the lesson, that hype stocks weren't for me. 

Then two days later, GME is at 90, and still rising. WHAT! So I got just in time to buy at 150 and sell at 130. Bought in again at 100. Watched the graph like a hawk (like that did any good, wtf?), sold at 98. Lost 300€. Well that sucked. I did the same mistake again, what the hell is wrong with me? So, I swore off the hype stocks again. Forever. Told my girlfriend, that maybe I just hard re-re-learn that lesson. 

So, come thursday. I'm on Instagram and see a post about GME and go check out the price – 300??? WHAT! 

I feel the rush. I feel the mistakes I made selling. I see this opportunity, and feel like I still have a chance to make so much money, so much, that I won't have to worry about it anymore, not for a while, what with no job and all. I don't want to make any rushed to moves, and still... I do just that. 

I go online and sell all my CGC and Aphria (worth 13.5k) and buy GME @ 400. But see, I'm smart, this time I won't buy all at once. I buy more at 350. Great price, right? And I buy more at 300. The price drops to 250. I feel... panic... and buy more at 220. The day closes at 198. 

But I have learned my lesson, right? Every time I sold it was a mistake. So this time, I hold. My plan was to sell Friday, so I just had to hold for one day and then... we close at 328! But... we didn't skyrocket? I read /r/wsb and got high on hopium. 

On the weekend, away from the soul sucking graph, I start to realize that I'm in way over my head. Unluckily I still believe that I could get rich, but still decide to sell of atleast 8k of the 13k, because can't even sleep anymore. 

Come monday. I don't sell right away. I thought there would be a spike and bought more on the way down, with 3k more at 220. And well. Why the fuck did I do that. I couldn't admit loss. I thought I had learned my lessons, but I guess I learned the wrong ones and held. 

 I start to actually research this short squeeze. But I don't undestand. It's an echo chamber. And I'm one these fucking monkeys.

**So, tuesday comes, and the stock I sold, CGC and Aphria, have rose 20% in value. I sell.** 

I sell almost everything, just leaving enough that if GME goes to 1000, I break even. And today, I'm going to sell that too. There is no bull thesis anymore. The shorters have loaded up again, the hype is dead, yada yada, I don't know... I still actually do see a glimmer of hope. But that's what a gamble is, right? It's a load of shit with some yellow dust sprinkled on top of it.

**Long story short, I'm 27 years old, currently jobless, and lost 15k of my 37k portfolio (savings) buying high and selling low. 23K of that money is unpaid, low interest student debt. I still don't fully grasp how I actually did this.**

&#x200B;

Ok, so it's wednesday, and I'm done with the initial tidal waves of self-hate and pain.  I guess at the moment I'm trying to make an incredibly expensive life lesson out of this. Other than accepting the loss, what else could I do? Except NOT take any more risks and trying to gamble the money I lost back – I have an impulse to do this. It might be the reason I am in this whole mess.

This is going to be a long post. Gonna go all the way my childhood, first 5k in savings and the cannabis rush of 2018 and losing 40k of value, and you know, almost gaining it back. Before this week. So, buckle up buddy boy, it's time to get brutally honest and probably die a little.

**Growing up** my family was quite poor, with first my father being a student and mother working, before both of them decided to become entrepreneurs.  Still I felt like we had everything, and for me that was pretty much some candy and an old PC, but we had no savings. My parents didn't come from money. I guess deep down I knew, I never wanted to burden my parents with any wants or needs.

 I always had this curious relationship with money. It's not that I wanted to buy anything, other than a new PC from parts every five years or so. I just wanted it. The money. I wanted it stashed in a safe place. I wanted to look at it. I wanted the security, I guess.

 So when I got my first student loan I blew it all on booze and drugs. I was in quite a dark place at the time. I didn't really understand what happened, actually still don't. I guess that's depression for you. I got better eventually and actually some good came from this reckless spending, as I didn't want to do that again.

&#x200B;

**This is where the investing part begins.** Two years later I inherited 5k from my grandfather, which for me, was so huge. So, no drugs this time, instead I started to learn about stocks. After a few bumps I actually got a good system down - and too-da-loo, it was index funds! 

I created a portfolio of different ETF's that closely followed a global world ETF with lower expenses.  I was quite proud of that. It was more work that way, but I quite I liked tinkering with my numbers and looking after my savings. Made me feel safe. 

However, there is a part of me that wants to gamble, get that quick money. And if I lost, instead of accepting the loss I wanted to double down. I had no understanding of value, only greed to get more, and fear of losing what I have, or had. All that just for the stake of having bigger numbers on the screen, as I had no plans of what to do with the money. I just wanted it.

Enter the first hype stocks. I read a lot of Finnish investing forums at the time. All my ""research"" was based on what was posted, and in most cases, not even the main posts, but the replies. So, given all that, I still managed to double my 750€ investment, or gamble in a certain stock, that isn't really relevant. And then I lost a few k chasing a falling dagger. Got out eventually. Stayed with indexes, and I was basicly set for life... if actually had stayed with that, I would have... man I don't even want to know.

412,GME," It's funny, I've been flipping between r/investing and r/wallstreetbets for a little over a month now. Obviously, I got caught up in the whirlwind of GME and invested (56 @ $106). I bought in just before it sky-rocketed and looking back, I SHOULD HAVE SOLD! Obviously, hindsight has 20/20 vision and if I bow out now I make a loss of £1800. It sucks. But in reality, I'm not too angry about the money, I only gambled what I was able to. 

The thing that's eating me, is that last week I had two opportunities (01/20) and (01/22) to sell for a profit of £10k. But I didn't. I got caught up in the emotion of it all and wanted more. More rise in share price, and more middle fingers to Wall St, and that's what i'm mad about. I'm disappointed in myself that I was so greedy and so naive. Had I not been, I would be sitting here right now thankful for the extra funds, and even if the price did rocket to meme heights, I don't think I would have cared much.

The moral of the story, for me at least, take your wins. Be happy. Don't be greedy and learn to be thankful for what positives do come your way.

Yes, I've invested ""what I can afford to lose"" and spoiler alert: I lost $1148. Laughable to some and I i know people lost millions, but to me this is cause for sleepless nights. Anyway, I feel like I've learned sooo much these past 8 days so that's a plus however, I'm still a bit bitter. I feel like we didn't ""lose"" fairly. If trade wasn't halted we were moving. So yes, you can laugh at those who jumped on, but in reality wouldn't it have been a good financial decision if there wasn't foul play?

Also, when is a good time to get out? Once you make back your original investment? When you've made back a portion?

432,OR," I went in $GME at $330 and again at $244 and $AMC at 9.44

I’ll be fine and honestly it’s a small blessing because I earned about $5k as an independent contractor last year and will likely owe around $700 in taxes once I file. I will be writing off my losses to help offset how much I owe.

Here’s my dilemma, should I sell and recoup what little money I can....OR just let this ride out and see what happens? Im in a position that I would be financially okay with loosing all the money I invested. So I can afford to lose it all. At this point my thought process is, if I have to fork over $700 to Uncle Sam in some form or fashion why not hold for the 1 in a million chance this actually spikes again (even if it only goes up to a break even point).

Idk what do y’all think?

Part of me also wants to pull out now because I’ve spent the past two days reading and watching everything I can in order to learn and understand the stock market. I’ve been playing around in a stock market simulator and when I actually use my brain, I make pretty decent calls. So part of me also wants to get my $200 and actually give the stock market a try and see if I can make some money back.

So I guess it comes down to should I hold and see what happens or sell and actually give trading a try. What do y’all think?",agarcia700,3,/r/investing/comments/lcchwr/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gm0l5j3/,0.033,0.888,0.079,0.8919

However, I still have and purchased into PLTR, i think they have a great few contracts, and the power they will possess to data access will be amazing. I'm thinking this 5k will most likely in 5 years pay back a good investment imo. It might reach half decent levels if played right. 

Apple is my next play. They have a bunch of new contracts, and are only just begun expansion into newer territories other than mobile and computer tech. Expect to see them make major news about quite a few new ventures soon. This is a 6-12 month investment.

Both I believe here will help me recoup the stupid gme loss.

437,CC," Posted here yesterday, copy-paste because I got no response.

I'll soon be getting roughly $5,000 to spend from a settlement when I was a minor that was put into a CD by my parents. I'm turning 29 this month, live in an apartment outside New Orleans, and have consistent income, with $6000 in CC debt I accrued while unemployed for 6 months due to covid. Without using the $5k I should have that debt paid off in 6-10 months, assuming no more global pandemics. Even sooner if the job I'm interviewing for pans out. Also assuming I move in with my girlfriend sometime this year, I won't be needing a down payment for a home. If that doesn't happen, I'll be ready for a down payment by mid 2021 by my projections.

Back to this $5k, what would be my best option for investment for growth within a couple of years? I've been playing the stock market in low volumes(put in $300 months ago) through IBKR and have made some money, lost some money, the usual. I didn't hop on GME or any of the other volatile investments currently. What I'd like to do is spend a good portion of that money on a single Amazon stock. The earliest I'll have this money in hand is next week, after the volatility of Amazon from their recent fine and Bezos' resignation blows over.

It seems to be a solid investment to me, and I don't plan on flipping it for profit until I have a reason, like adding to the previously mentioned down payment, emergency expenses, etc. I wouldn't touch it for my usual trading, since I'd rather not piss that money away on what amounts to a gamble. I also acknowledge that *I'm completely fucking ignorant* when it comes to finance and investing as a whole, excepting stock trading where I'm only mostly ignorant. My parents have a lot of investing experience, but they've been pulled out of everything but their IRAs since roughly 2005 and the world has changed a lot since then, so I don't want to go solely off of their input. 

If there are better options, like a mutual fund or short term bonds, or if I'd be better served putting it straight towards that CC debt, I'd be interested in your input. I'd definitely like to maintain some degree of liquidity, or at least not have it locked away for a decade.",TacosArePeopleToo,2,/r/investing/comments/lcchwr/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/glzpisw/,0.048,0.836,0.116,0.9777

449,GME," Hey everyone. I´ve come here because wsb sounds a bit of an echo chamber, so I'm afraid I'm not going to get good advise there.

I'm from Portugal, and I'm 22. I currently own close to 1 share in GME, I know it's not much, but it is what I could afford as a student with a part time job. I bought in at 90, with money I was willing to gamble. When GME hit 400 I sold 90 dollars worth of it to cover my initial investment. My question is: should I sell the rest of the GME I own, or should I wait, in case the squeeze does happen ? My mindset was, since I have nothing to lose, I might aswell hold it and see where it goes, but it does not look promising, and it is money i could be using for something else.

As a new guy in investing I'm trying to pin point some good stocks (ideally around 1-2 dollars / share) for both short / long term investment in green energy and / or med-tech sectors. Currently I'm trading on T212

464,AAPL," The current market valuations are pretty high historically. There are a number of reasons for that and not making an argument for the overall market being over or undervalued. A lot of this is driven by companies such as Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon. Those three alone make up a market cap of nearly $6 Trillion and have had pretty crazy stock price growth over the last few years. Berkshire Hathaway is the 8th most valuable company on the list sitting at around 550B market cap and has been underperforming the market for a while now. 


By market cap, AAPL is 4.13x as big as BRK. If there was a hypothetical where you could either have the entire company AAPL, or a fictional company that was essentially 4.13 Berkshires, here is what some of the financials would look like: 

|**In Billions**|||4.12922869|
:--|:--|:--|:--|
||**BRK**|**AAPL**|**Buy BRK 4.1 Times**|
|**Market Cap**| 550| 2,273| 2,273|
|||||
|**Total Revenue**| 279| 274| 1,153|
|**Net Income from Continuing &amp; Discontinued Operation**| 36| 58| 148|
|||||
|**Total Assets**| 818| 324| 3,377|
|**Cash**| 147| 192| 605|
|**Total Investments**| 366|| 1,510|
|**Total Equity**| 429| 65| 1,770|

So for the same price as AAPL, you could get a company with

$1.15 Trillion in revenue vs $274 Billion 

$148 Billion in net income vs $58 Billion 

**$605 Billion cash on hand** vs $192 Billion 

$1.5 Trillion investment portfolio vs $0 (does AAPL have investments?)

$1.8 Trillion balance sheet equity vs $65 Billion 


I know there are differences in the income growth of AAPL vs BRK, however from a fundamentals perspective, it looks like this would be a complete no brainer decision on which company I would want to own. It seems BRK themselves thing this is the case too as they have sold some of their position in AAPL and have been doing record buybacks of their own stock.

New to investing and have budgeted about $1000 a month to invest, this is apart from the $500 I already put into my Roth IRA every month.

I currently have some positions on Robinhood but don't really know what I'm doing.

Roth IRA - $500

ZOM - 73 shares

AMC - 13 shares

NAKD - 9 shares

NOK - 1 share

CRIS - 9.48 shares

F - 4.39 shares

WKHS - 5.01 shares

477,DGII," Hey y'all,

Awfully new to this stuff. Went 0-60 on GME last week and figured I might as well figure out what I'm doing while I'm here, haha

Anyhow, was (arbitrarily) poking around in Robinhood's ""Upcoming Earnings"" tag, trying to make sense of how an earnings call moved things up/down.

Found out that [Yahoo also has a more-comprehensive list of this info](https://finance.yahoo.com/calendar/earnings?from=2021-01-31&to=2021-02-06&day=2021-02-02), however now I'm noticing that the Reported (second) column for a particular stock-- DGII-- is seriously different on Yahoo ([image](https://i.imgur.com/uBZaaIl.png)) than the same stock on Robinhood ([image](https://i.imgur.com/dSCYh4L.png), [stock link](https://robinhood.com/stocks/DGII)).

So I have a few questions:

1. Are these two sites saying incompatible things? Or is there some caveat/difference in definition I'm not seeing somewhere?
2. I'm trying to use Yahoo's [statistics](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/DGII/key-statistics?p=DGII) and [financials](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/DGII/financials?p=DGII) tabs for DGII, to manually recreate their `-0.01` number and can't get it, for the life of me. Took Gross Profit from quarterly financials divided by shares outstanding from statistics for: `37.52M/29.04M = 1.29` which is crazy far from either of the values I'd expected to see. Moreover, it's *also* different from the info I get looking at [nasdaq](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/dgii/revenue-eps). What am I missing here?
3. I also understand that there's some variation in what day a company will deem Q1...4 of a fiscal year. Am I just looking at the wrong time period altogether?

482,GME," I like many others jumped on wsb and was sucked into the hype around GME in the last few weeks. Over the last few days my perception shifted from being delusional to finally realising that yes, by all accounts it's probably over.

I would like to ask what I could do now to recover. I don't need to be told I'm an idiot because that's obvious. I bought a total of 24.5 shares at an average of $206. So right now I'm down about half of my money. I'm not wealthy and losing roughly $2.5k does hurt. I know putting in only what you can afford to lose is smart but I'm not smart.

I'd like to hear some thoughts from smarter more experienced people as to what I could do to recover.

I haven't sold anything at this point. What would you do? Would you sell now and lost 50% of your investment. I don't feel it's heading back up anytime soon. Would you hold for the long long term hoping to eventually recoup that money?

I know it's an over discussed topic but I would really appreciate some advice. I know I'm not the only one out there right now hurting from this and maybe creating some kind of advice topic could help a lot of people from hurting more in the next few weeks.

GM announced a deal with Microsoft and Fors with Google, which means each company has to maintain their network and cloud environment. Wouldn't these deals have either downstream impact on the supply chain. Is there a way to capitalize on those stocks?

503,VTR," First post here, so if I am in the wrong spot, my fault. I do not understand how Ventas has not returned to all time highs, the reasons are stated below.

&#x200B;

First, this dipped huge in March due to a large senior living portfolio. That makes total sense, but with these communities being first in line for the vaccine, these locations will be safer than older adults living with sons and daughters who are working in the real world. The snap back and pent up demand should start to be reflected in the upcoming projection.

&#x200B;

Second, much like the Chipotle ($CMG) and Brinker ($EAT) stock rise, the biggest, largest players are the ones who will survive and will come out of the recession stronger. The little guys in this market are likely to go under or be unable or unwilling to make the necessary capital investments. These will potentially be investment opportunities for VTR or VTR can build new locations cheaply with low rates.

&#x200B;

Third, rush for income. Currently, Ventas pay around a 3.78% dividend which was cut from 6.54%. This dividend should be turned back on this year and possibly even raised. With interest rates low for the next two years, institutional and 40/60 investors will be seeking safe significant dividends.

&#x200B;

There are other tailwinds but these are the major three that make up my thesis. Earnings are on 2/18/2021 and whether you want to wait for the forecast/dividend position. I think this stock's time is coming.

But AMC has been driven up too with a much smaller short position. Even if we don't see a swarm of investors buying calls on M, the shorts have got to feel like they've drifted into deep waters. I'm thinking the smart money will exit and see how this settles given the potential down side of a short squeeze and a feeding frenzy on the minds of retail investors.

518,CD," My bank keeps offering me a $30k loan at a 1.8% interest rate. At this moment I don't need it for anything. But I was thinking that I could put those $30k in a CD that could range from 4 - 6% interest rate. I mention a CD because they are pretty much safe and insured here. And I could easily pay it up in case something goes wrong, as I have a good amount in savings. I could earn something and it will help my credit score. Is it worth it? Is there anything I should double check if I decide to proceed with it? Thanks!

E: I'm not from the US and the CD is not in USD. That's why the interests rate of the CD seems pretty high.",PuzzledPerceptionAg,1,/r/investing/comments/lcchwr/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gm0cb0g/,0.032,0.727,0.24,0.9795
519,HYRE," Hey guys! New to the page, as well as investing so I look forward to learning a lot. I have a question about how to interpret something. I've had my eye on HYRE. They recently announced a $25 million public offering of common stock, stating that they are going to use the proceeds for working capital and general corporate purposes. Is this generally a red flag, or is it a common way for a company to get a boost so they can work on growth?  


Like I said, I'm pretty new to this so it might be a rookie question lol. Just wondering if it's an immediate ""hell no"" or if there are specific things you guys would recommend researching about the company given this info.",slendabilt,1,/r/investing/comments/lcchwr/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gm0cqsg/,0.052,0.806,0.142,0.8718

521,ACB,"  G'day,

I'm a 23 years old student, and started investing as soon as I earned money. I followed the safest advices at first, and held on around 60% long shot shares (Total, that gave me around 150€ every quarter, not bad pocket money), and the rest in a French ETF.

Now fast forward to 2018, I started a new training, took a loan (the interest rate was so low it was worth it to keep all my investment and get the loan to pay school), but I shuffled my investments a bit to put everything in an ETFs, and Bonds. Since then I got small gains but who can complain about passive income?

With the recent frenzy I decided to take some money out and create a ""fun portfolio"", lost a bit but It taught me a LOT about day trading, due diligence, and the risk of hype.

It also opened me to a new world of ETFs and companies I never thought about, hence this post.

I intend on keeping my fun money but shuffling my investments as one has seen a growth so pathetic recently, It makes me wonder what am I missing.

So here it is, after looking hard at what are some good percentages to invest here and there, I decided to put in the followings:

\~40% into a company called Air Liquide, it's a solid company with small yet sizeable dividends: 2%, the big upside is every two years, for every 10 shares owned, you get an additional. The stock price is also a rock, meaning in case of an emergency I can essentially pull out what I put there in the first place. Moreover, they've been immensely present in the medical sector and have seen a steady growth.

\~57% in ETFs, mostly in the iShares core S&P 500 ([IDUS.UK](https://idus.uk/)), which has the lowest expanse ratio I've seen at 0.07%, while displaying the same performances as the SPY, and the rest in the iShares Global Clean Energy ([IQQH.DE](https://iqqh.de/)), it's got a large expanse ratio at 0.65% but is seducing me for many reasons. One of them being that I love to invest into what I believe.

\~3% is my ""fun fund"", which includes UAL, NOK, ACB and DKNG, not the sexiests I'll give you that but I had an immense amount of fun doing my DD on those and believe they will yield some nice growth.

Now I'm very curious about what the experienced guys think about this, I've read a good between shares and indexes is (100-age). My plan is to put a percentage of my pay every month in the ETFs mostly, so their percentages will increase as time goes by. I'm not trying to make a quick buck, nor get some pocket money. I'm just trying to secure my future, make what I worked for so far worth it, and gain some experience!

It started off well, at one point I was up \~roughly $5,000, but I am at the point now where if I cash out, I will be at around a $2,500 loss. The loss is quite disappointing, but I would very much like to stay in the market.

404 shares of BB @ $15.85

I am currently employed around 65k a year before taxes. 3% goes to 401k company matches to 6% but been using that extra 3% towards building an emergency fund since I learned a few hard lessons not having one. With car issues. And then paying extra towards loans.

I’m now looking towards building some extra savings up to build up to pay off student debt faster as well as save for a down payment for a house. Currently around 60k in student debt. 7k on a car loan, the student loan is like 50:50 private/ fed loans so the fed loans being 0% have been using that payment to pay off my car faster than the 5 year run I think I should be able to pay it off by aug when it ends.

I currently have Nokia, BB, NAKD, and Aphria stocks but I think I’d rather be in an ETF where I don’t need to constantly follow the company news. I have around 1000$ in robinhood right now. My company offers a stock program for reduce price but it comes out of paycheck. They gave us like 5% of our paycheck in stocks in sept that vests in sept this year since they pushed back our reviews.

Debt pyments per month is
315$ priv loan ~ 4.5% interest
Fed loan 50$ Not paused ~ 4% interest
Fed loan 296$ 0% interest till aug
Car loan ~ 200$ a month 6%ish interest

Rent is around 1100$ a month with utilities and pay is about 3600$ a month. I use my credit card to buy most things for reward pts then pay it off.

Bought a few things recently so credit card balance around 400$ but should be gone in a pay check or 2.

My biggest aim is to get out of debt and get a down payment for a house. I can be a little risky but do like to play on the safe side.

Are there good ETFs to get into? I’m looking at a lot of these and they are like 300$ a share but was trying to find some cheaper more safe ones.

What I have been wondering is what the current sentiment is on the ARK holdings (ARKG, ARKK, ARKF, ARKQ) as well as their 3D printing, Cryptocurrency and (???) Space exploration avenues. Lately I have had a 'too good to be true' feeling - not backed up by any DD.

Past discussions show that redditor's opinions of Cathie's ARK holdings are somewhat polarized, some people love them and they make up a large % of their portfolio. Others think they are either expensive, gimmicky, and destined to burn out.

I expect to continue to increase my ARKK and ARKG until I see a reason to do otherwise.

546,GME," This past Monday I opened an account with Fidelity, transferring my Roth IRA from a stagnant Pershing account to them. Opening an account with Fidelity was quick and easy, and customer service was top notch. Now that the transfer is complete, and Fidelity has my money, wait time is now an hour or more on the phone. I'm assuming it's b/c of the WSB retail investors.

I have less than $20k in my account. I want to do a mix of Income stocks and Day Trading. I know that I'm less than the $25k threshold for multiple trades per week. My question to Fidelity was: Since Fidelity offers margin, can I add the margin to my existing account to reach the $25k threshold and Day Trade?

552,DD," I'm an absolute beginner, swept up in GME. Took a small loss which I'm chalking up to the price of a lesson. But now the hype has died down I'm looking to take investing more seriously.

29yo in New Zealand. ~35k a year income (USD). Would like to slowly build wealth with some room for punts on short-term gains. I'm only depositing expendable play-money to start out with until I get a feel for the market, which means I'll still have a decent risk tolerance (even after being burned by the Gamestop debacle) until I've built up a decent portfolio. No current debt.

I like the tech sector for obvious reasons, as well as Green Energy (walking stereotype here).

I'm wondering about what a standard ratio of safe, slow-gain stocks vs slightly higher risk investments would look like for a beginner.

I feel like there's less to consider with larger, more stable companies and that simply following the DD done by others would inherently carry less risk, so I'll skip over that for now.

I've done some basic research (still a long way to), but from what I've gathered, some of the important things to consider when looking and investments with a higher risk/reward ratio (or any company I suppose) are:

Market cap - Lower market cap = more volatile stock, less stable in times of economic hardship, more room for accelerated growth or decline. The market caps would be how much the market views a company as being worth (taking into account projected growth / decline), whereas the EV is how much a company is worth on paper.

EV - Would an EV / market cap comparison indicate anything, or is this an irrelevant stat? The only thing I can see EV being useful for in smaller companies is it's value in a merger / takeover. In a takeover, do the stocks of the two companies usually stay separate? Does a high EV indicate a more resilient company? Obviously still struggling to see what EV is useful for when speculating..

P/S and P/E - From what I gather P/E is just P/S which goes one step further and takes operating costs into account? Is this view too simplistic?

I'd also be looking at developments and news on both the company and the sector it operates in, as well as the companies competition in the sector.

I'm not looking to get into technical analysis yet, just focusing on fundamentals. Any critique on anything I've said and further advice would be extremely appreciated, as would be some resources where I can do this kind of research.

560,GME," **I have to admit I have a problem.** When I see a way to make a quick buck I tend to believe it. I feel this rush. Time and time again. And then I feel like a fucking idiot. I do like to gamble, even if others do it I look down on them. I wanted to hurt myself so much this passing week, but luckily I have a girlfriend worth more than any amount of money, and she has looked after me. She just sent me a text and asked me how I'm doing.

I still kick myself in the head about all the opportunies to fix this I didn't take, and probably will for some time. Of course. It's an absurd amount of money. If I didn't do this, I would have 42K, damn... at the moment I feel like with that I would've ben set up for life. Down the road that would've been house money. During this time, I actually started to think about what I want to make with this money... and I do want to buy a nice house at some point, for me and the gf. That's everything I really care about. 

 I'm kind of proud I got up faced all this hurt, didn't hurt myself, drink or escape or nothing. Here I am, writing, listening to some fucking Lofi Bernie Sanders mix and crying over money, or you know, the fact that it was me that made the huge mistake.

&#x200B;

 **Ok, to wrap this up.** I think growing up poor and decisions I made later on has made me have this strange relationship with money. It makes me feel safe, yet all the time I am afraid of losing it, or not noticing situations to make more of it.

I guess that has to do with even deeper psychological issues, of not quite trusting anyone else and having a skewed sense of self-worth and feelings of self-hate. I want to punish myself, or at least make the money back as soon as possible – but both of those ways to think are flawed. I made a mistake, and wanting to punish myself might be the reason the cost of it was so absurdly high (FOMO'd into GME for three times god damn, always rising the bets). 

  
And I will make the money back, the old fashioned way. Playing the waiting game. If I take more risk, it would be only to gamble or prove something.

562,CEO," > How do you guys keep track of so much news all the time to spot these investments?

I have a weird ability to remember some stock that I looked at like 5 years ago but I can't remember where I put the remote 2 minutes ago. I really enjoy investing so looking at company after company for hours is fun and enjoyable. Something I'm not interested in? Don't focus on it/retain information about it well. I think about investing all the time. If you see me posting on here at some absurd hour of the morning I'm thinking about stocks. 

People have to be on the lookout for trends and ask themselves questions about where they think society is heading and then look for plays on those themes and you have to really try to do that before those themes become a common topic. Themes have been a focus of mine - things like pets (humanization of pets, increased adoption - which really took off during the pandemic when shelters were emptied, etc) when I invested in Idexx about 5 years ago. Digital payments, science, telehealth, digital healthcare and improvements in patient experience (things like Livongo, which was a big win.)

Flashy wants are cool and you can do very well, but I think people don't focus enough on needs and if a service or product can really improve on what is a need for people (Livongo, for example), then that can do very, very well. The healthcare system is a mess; things that can provide value (save time/money, greater efficiency, improved patient experience, improve medication adherence, etc) I think are going to be very successful and if things do go South in the broader economy, those stocks are going lower too but there's an underlying need there that can provide some degree of buffer vs a highly discretionary want. So I do think that people should not have a portfolio full of highly discretionary ""wants"" - there should be some things in your portfolio that are mission critical for the customer, whether it be an individual or a company.

""How do you how whether a stock you come across out of the thousands you can scan through, is worth the time investment of digging deeper? ""

Is there a moat? Is there recurring revenue? Is it a relevant company whose product or service I see becoming increasingly relevant in the future? Is it part of what I think is going to be an important broader theme in the years ahead? What are customer reviews like? What are employee reviews like? Is there some aspect of this company that has real future potential that I think people are to some degree underestimating? Admittedly, I have to find what the business does interesting - if I couldn't care less, that's an issue. I tend to like life sciences a lot because of the printer-and-ink nature of a lot of that business; sell the machine and then sell the consumables over-and-over again.

I often refer to this blog (http://enseqlopedia.com/2016/05/basespace-updated-no-more-free-bioinformatics/) about Illumina charging for data storage about 5 years ago. Note the bolded.

""**My 70+TB are costing Illumina around $25,000 per year so I can understand them not wanting to pick up the tab – *but this represents about 1% of my annual spend on consumables and support* so I can’t help but see this change as more than a little avaricious**.""

Illumina has been bumpy at times over the last couple of years (in part due to weakness in consumer genomics) but when you look at that or a Thermo Fisher or other companies in life sciences, there's a lot of annual spend on consumables. 

Danaher:

""For example, on the company's investor and analyst meeting in December, management outlined that 65% of its total revenue now came from consumables."" (https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/07/07/theres-more-than-meets-the-eye-to-danaher-corporat.aspx)

So I can own a Thermo Fisher (which is a large holding) and was a great company before this, is benefiting significantly during this and I think is going to be a great company after this. I think after the pandemic is finally over, there's going to likely be more funding for science, more research and if that's the case, more money for a Thermo Fisher. In the meantime, given the nature of the business, I'm very comfortable owning it. 

And being comfortable owning it is important. I don't want things that I feel I have to ""babysit"" - I want to own things that I don't have to think about on a day-to-day basis, whether it be a more speculative name or a more stable name.

Lastly, sometimes I'm very impressed with management. I was impressed with Jeff Green after seeing Trade Desk earnings and listening to him provide basically a company update and overview of the industry in the span of a conference call and I invested. That was at $70. The stock almost got to $1,000. There's no scientific basis to this by any means, but I do like when a CEO seems to love to talk and talk and talk about the business and industry and feels like they could go on for another hour or two if they could.

1. QQQ and AAPL and MSFT. QQQ is 20+% AAPL and MSFT. So either just buy QQQ (preferable), or go with AAPL+MSFT.

2. Do not invest 15% of your income in crypto even if ""you believe in it."" Invest 5 bucks like you do with Coke.

3. Don't do SPY and VTI at the same time. Pick one. Large (SPY) or all (VTI) ?

4. QQQ itself is a bit meh. Yes tech has done very well, but rarely a sector keeps doing above market average for many decades. But who knows, maybe tech it is.

600,GME," I think once emotion gets involved with shares, then logic goes out the window. You aren’t at all alone in any of the things you’ve said or the feelings you’ve expressed and in some ways you’re quite wise acknowledging them. I read a post yesterday about a guy who took a 100k loan out at 20% to buy GME shares. If this doesn’t work out for him, he’s probably going to be paying that debt for the rest of his life; his post reads with such optimism though. Even if he gets every penny back he’s exactly the kind of person who would spend it all again on a similar risk.

When you gamble the short term rush of dopamine you get from the actual gamble will be high, it’ll be even higher if you win but will disperse when you lose; this is basically why gambling exists because people seek these kinds of things and enjoy them. There’s no harm in doing that but consider the loss before taking the risk and the impact (easier said than done I know). Cliche remark: “only gamble what you can afford to lose” I think this is dated advice now anyway; I can afford to lose my savings if I keep my job, does that mean I should? 

The more I focus on this share the more I begin to appreciate how dangerous it’s been. The outcomes are never going to match the hype and even if they did a lot of the excitement is the process; being in something big together. I think a lot of people will really regret the decisions they’ve made along the way unfortunately. If it all goes wrong for everyone else consider yourself lucky, if it all goes perfectly for everyone else and you feel like you missed out, you didn’t, you were part of the process and excitement and in the end you accepted that your life is good with or without money and cut your loses. 

I invested in a single share in GME as an experiment, I was fairly confident in how the play would pan out and it followed my predictions almost precisely and yet found myself constantly anxious, I had feelings I’ve never felt before and completely ignored the logical part of my brain which told me “this is not going well”. Even though I was basically banking on a loss to begin with. I also basically ignored my wife and child for a week while I watched a ticker. I realise now how much of a dick I was and that was 0.0001% of my portfolio; it somewhat demonstrates (hopefully) that you’re not at all alone in these feelings at all. I never take risks, I’m not a gambler, I’ve got a shit load of money, I considered this a complete experiment and I was almost certain this share would tank and I still got sucked in on the hope I’d be a millionaire. 

Hope things go well for you and your girlfriend; be thankful for the real things that matter in your life and accept that taking things slow is just as rewarding as getting them instantly (another reason gambling works so efficiently). Be thankful you’ve got a job and a relationship and some stability.

Right this is starting to sound like a sob story. I think whatever the outcome is you made the right decision; if this share goes to the moon, you still did the right thing in my eyes.",religionisanger,5,/r/investing/comments/lcchwr/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/glzgjsk/,0.115,0.728,0.157,0.9813

691,IMO," I think it was a short squeeze and short squeezes don't go on forever (see Dryships in 2016; in that case when the squeeze was over I think there was one point where the stock was halted and then it re-opened substantially lower.) 

Anything much beyond that IMO is kind of unnecessarily overcomplicating the situation. 

Chamath actually bought into this - and he did well and got out and made money. Turning it into some sort of ""people vs hedge fund"" and ""hold forever"" thing is just going to wind up with people left holding the bag when the squeeze is over.

Major short squeezes have happened before (Dryships, VW, etc), they will happen again on occasion and I think the only difference this time around is that retail investors seemed to get way involved. The Dryships situation resulted in a relatively minor amount of posts on here and was quickly forgotten about but that was a very substantial short squeeze. When the Dryships squeeze ended, the stock returned back to a few bucks and eventually was taken private, probably after that scam of a company did a few more reverse splits (which was basically the only thing it seemed good at doing.)

The only thing I think might change is that they might (emphasis might) make it more difficult for retail investors to have options access.",dvdmovie1,27,/r/investing/comments/lcc9xk/gamestop_and_its_implications_for_the_future/glz685b/,0.045,0.92,0.035,-0.4854

The **value** of stock is based upon the value of the company.  The **price** of the stock is, and always has been, based upon supply and demand - just like anything else that people buy and sell.  *Typically*, that supply and demand are predominantly influenced by the underlying fundamentals of the company.  But, as exhibited by GME over the past 2 weeks, that's not always the case.

And I would venture to say that it is rare than fundamentals are the *only* thing that impact supply and demand.  There's always going to be people who buy and sell stocks for reasons that most of us wouldn't consider ""fundamentals"".",Bobby_does_reddit,8,/r/investing/comments/lcc9xk/gamestop_and_its_implications_for_the_future/glzjchx/,0.05,0.878,0.071,0.5994

694,EV," > What does this say about fundamental investing? Does more emphasis need to be placed on the vision of a company as a measure of valuation?

​The people with the most money and the most skin in the stock market decide this, as they always have done. Historically it might be accurate to say that perhaps too much emphasis was placed on current performance over ""potential"" - but that's also because current performance is inherently risk-averse. If you have $10k and you really dont want to lose it, it makes a lot more sense to flock to established stocks with clear value. A company like Coca-Cola isn't going to go bust overnight, and if it ""does badly"" that probably means dropping by 10% or so - so its hardly risky. (Of course it's still better to invest in an ETF/ index as that is also less risky than a single company). This will always mean those successful stocks/ etfs/ indexes are more popular with investors and therefore perhaps ""overpriced"" compared to up-and-coming options which *might* blow up.

But the fundamental rule here is that money decide this. If we suddenly get a load of people coming into the stock market who don't care if they lose 40%+ of their initial investment on start-up companies, then that would definitely change the market.

> Will there be changes made to our financial system? Personally this has also made me understand the value thesis of cryptocurrency better. Before, I thought it was worthless because it was connected to no underlying asset but maybe decentralization is an important enough asset?

This is obviously entering kind of dangerous/ very risky speculation - but maybe. I'll avoid actually giving advice or commenting on what I personally think (although what I personally think is that most people really do not understand what is going on).

I basically see 4 potential scenarios:

1. De-fi fails. Status quo. (Banks, brokers and governments remain in charge of how the world's economy works.) If you believe this, you also believe that cryptocurrency (at least in a de-fi form) will fail and that BTC and friends will be worth $0 in the future. If you believe this, your money is much safer in the form of bonds, low interest saving accounts, or even (compared to something that will crash) just as cash. You should also be relatively safe with established stocks/ index/ whatever.

2. De-fi is basically a worldwide revolution that spreads incredibly quickly once most people see its benefits, value and convenience (to remain transparently unbiased - it also has problems). For this to happen we're waiting on things like Amazon accepting crypto as payment, we're waiting for (widely downloaded) crypto apps, we're waiting for (widely supported) hubs of public networks that bring private support to the individual. We're probably also looking at centralised DBs disappearing. Maybe twitter, FB, etc roll with the punch and become chain based. Maybe they are overthrown by new apps that offer the privacy upgrade immediately. Now, if you believe this - you should be looking at crytpo very seriously. You should also take a very discerning look at current companies and assess whether or not they'd either remain completely intact, get destroyed, or adapt with such a revolution. Because if this happens (crypto suddenly is worth loads) - then the ""losers"" are everyone in the world who doesn't own crypto, whatever investments they have will fall in value.

3. De-fi is gradually more accepted and starts to seep into the consumer market without drama, a major revolution or a huge overhaul. We're basically looking at point 2, but drawn out over a much longer period of time - very likely closely connected to the cycle of different generations of people entering work (particularly those that had the internet as kids vs those that did not). If you believe this then the advice to #2 also applies, but in a less extreme way.

4 - De-fi does not fail but does get banned or heavily discouraged by major world powers - perhaps all, perhaps only some. This would not kill crypto but if crypto was essentially made illegal, it makes it much harder to predict what would happen. Of course BTC does not need to be legal to function, but if a company like Amazon can't officially recognise it - or if official apps can't be freely available in big markets (like the US or EU) then that's an issue. This would be extremely difficult to predict what would be best. Obviously Crypto prices would drop very quickly, but there is significant chance that a fraction keeps their interest due to de-fi benefits and the price could either re-stabilise or grow even further later on (it could also potentially be unbanned, who knows).


In terms of how close we are to any 4 of these points right now? Objectively, we're not really that close to any. There hasn't been serious traction on new apps and products leverging crypto, or huge players in the market adopting it (yet). There also hasn't really been any very serious news or moves to completely ban bitcoin (although as always there are some click baity headlines and articles if you go looking). But the status quo also isn't completely untouched - crypto is making a move. Average people are starting to hear about it more. All of this means that it is difficult to predict which one we're headed towards overall - it could still be any of them. The fact that bitcoin hasn't gone away after more than a decade is probably one of the most objective points it has going in its favour.



I think that it is very important that any conclusion (about what to do in terms of investing) is reached logically, rather than actually commenting on what is likely to happen or whether or not you personally ""believe"" or ""don't believe"". It's important to remember that not only are individual humans pretty stupid, overly emotional and ignorant about a lot of things (including most of us) - but the general population is too. So are poor people, so are rich people. 

The thing I would say (and the reason why I personally am going to keep a close eye on on crypto and de-fi ideas) is that; expected value is important here. $5k in crypto could go to $0. But even if you are pretty sure that this would happen (say you are 90% sure it would), you need to consider the other side. If there is a 10% chance that de-fi is the future and there is basically a revolution, then that $5k could be worth $500k. Simple maths using these numbers would say that this has an EV of $50k on a $5k investment (bet). It's impossible for me to say how likely it is that crypto fails, but I personally believe that the chance crypto/ de-fi has some kind of future is probably higher than 5%, which means (for me personally) that it makes logical sense to hedge money on it. 

It would be pretty stupid to dump all your investment into crypto and de-fi ideas (even people who really believe in bitcoin should at least recognise that because some people dont' like it/ are sceptical - it clearly has a non zero chance to fail). But it would also be bad to find yourself on the wrong side if this kind of economic restructuring does happen and you are way too late to the party. That doesn't mean you need to invest in crypto/de-fi now. But if you haven't invested, you should follow news and updates.

If anyone is wondering what kind of revolution BTC/ crypto / de-fi could be: i'd definitely recommend educating yourself about it properly and not just listening to a few guys on reddit. But if you are going to do this, you should also **definitely** try to get multiple perspectives about both sides of the argument. The problem with crypto is that most people are very vocally for or against it, and you will struggle to get a completely unbiased take. You should also be aware that since **so much money is potentially at stake** that there could easily be large forces trying to convince you one way or the other - it's important to remain relatively unbiased.",Komandokitsune,0,/r/investing/comments/lcc9xk/gamestop_and_its_implications_for_the_future/glzld4z/,0.081,0.782,0.137,0.9977

I'm no auto engineer or anything like that, but that timeline seems nearly impossible.

Why would Hyundai-Kia supposedly be this close to producing a car with Apple but not have a contract yet? Neither company is going to go into this lightly. Hyundai will be taking on the burden of producing this vehicle, so they would want to have an iron clad agreement that benefits them by now, no? And supposedly Apple's name will be all over this car and filled with their software and AI? But we have no contract agreement... no prototype... nothing. No company, even Apple, can just string along another company (with a project this big and important for both) for years and then change their mind and go with another company at the last minute. 

Frankly your articles don't really add anything to the speculation.

Used game sales will always have a market. It cannot be a huge chunk of the revenue, but it also can be a solid part of it.

Your computer parts comment is very weird because if you go to many stores that sell anything they have employees with no idea what you're talking about. Try going to Home Depot for stuff. Sometimes you will get informed employees and sometimes you don't. But this misunderstands what selling computer parts would be. It would allow quick access to parts in a matter of hours if they do delivery or minutes if they have pickup at store.

Well, if you look at people in the games industry some of them are  having issues themselves with managing hard drive space and games for their PS5/XSX. CoD is like 300 GBs or something insane. Games will only go up in size. So going all digital isn't going to happen soon.

783,GB," I'm not so sure. People thought it was going to happen this gen. People thought that when PS4/XB1 were coming out. I think we have to realize the infrastructure for downloading capabilities might not be there in 10 years. Both PS5 and XSX have a digital only version, but it remains to be seen the split of disc vs. non disc user base. Plus how happy people are when they have to download 200+ GB files constantly or move stuff around on external hard drives. Or when they only have one marketplace and these games don't go on sale. We have yet to see the widespread adoption of next gen consoles to fully understand what gamers of all kinds will put up with. 

When PS4 Pro came out and the Xbox One X came out people thought we'd see a cellphone model type console sale plan. It didn't happen. Gamers very much like their generations. Gamers are very stubborn and people who don't game often or buy stuff for gamers get confused easily. So I can see a backlash from all digital from some people who get XSX or PS5 with no disc drive. There's no marketplace for sales on those games besides their storefronts. 

Eventually we will move away from discs, but I think we always overestimate how far the industry progresses and underestimate the pushback. 

DRM statement killed XB1. I'm willing to bet Sony will not ruin its huge earnings by going all digital until they have most of the core players onboard.

802,IBM," Since the $85 call is ITM whoever bought it from you could decide to exercise it early before ex-dividend date and collect the dividend themselves. You'll earn the $0.88 premium on selling the call but the buyer may decide they want the 1.63 dividend. Best case you get $0.88 nearly immediately for a technically really high APR. Worst case you hold it all quarter before they exercise it and you get 0.88 and no dividend (APR would be equivalent to 2.9% if it happened right before the first dividend).

Also, since the stock can still go down if you want a safe interest rate (you said nearly 100% guarantee) you'll need to buy the $85 put for $7.15. IBM went down by an equivalent percentage drop as 119 to 85 as recently as 2017 to 2019 which is the same 2 years period you're looking at. Now the 1.63 dividend times 8 quarters minus 7.15 is 5.89. 5.89/119/(2 years) = 2.47%. if you want a safe bet you're looking at 2.47% instead of 5+.

Are there FTD numbers released already for 1/29? On the SEC website, I only see info for January 6th 2021. The thing with FTD is that they don't necessarily have to buy back shares to deliver and can practically roll over their short shares positions. Based on some financial literature i just read, FTDs is actually strategically used by Market makers when the cost to borrow a share is high, or for some reason can not be located.

You've taken the narrative from W\*B. At this point it is fair to assume that the opposite of anything they're saying is likely true.

842,SA," People pump and dump stocks all the time, but someone has a negative thesis on a company and they short it and they're a villain? There are actually bad companies out there. There are scams (Nikola.) There are certainly valid reasons to be negative on companies at times.

Pfizer has been a mediocre company for ages now; they were lucky that the Allergan deal was blocked years back, saved them from making a bad decision. Additionally, as for the vaccine, tons of tourists piled into Pfizer when they should have went into Pfizer's partner BioNTech but people didn't because Pfizer was what they were aware of. There's been so many questions on here over the last year of ""Pfizer has the vaccine, why isn't the stock doing anything!?!?!""

""in about five minutes they brought everything down,""

How do you know that was shorting and not simply selling? The thing that I think is problematic is when people start blaming short selling and ""manipulation conspiracies"" every time a stock goes down - you're never going to sell or realize an investment situation is actually negative if you think that every time a stock goes down it's some sort of conspiracy. It literally turns into this: https://imgflip.com/i/4wmvgt, which also has the effect of creating an endless stream of material for this: https://twitter.com/BagholderQuotes/

If a company is complaining about short sellers - the Lemonade co-founder the other week had a whole giant Twitter thread (which he admitted was wrong and deleted) about how SeekingAlpha writers should have to write a positive article if they write a negative one and other nonsense - if you are *that* bothered that a SeekingAlpha writer wrote something about your company that was not 100% positive, then that's awfully concerning for shareholders because it makes the company seem awfully fragile that that is *that* concerning.

 All executives should be concerned about is creating great products and services - if they're doing that, someone writing a SA blog post shouldn't matter to them and addressing it is time that could have been spent better elsewhere.  Genuinely great companies often have genuinely great stocks over time and maybe there's a blip or two along the way but that's all that they ultimately really are in the long run. Executives shouldn't be having a tantrum because a blogger wrote something that wasn't 100% positive.

""They brought everything down"" - it was down like half a % or something.

Lastly, the earnings report wasn't great - they had a revenue beat but a profit miss. 

Additionally, I think there's also the broader issue of erosion of civil conversation for a lot of things. People can't have a thoughtful conversation with someone who has a different opinion on their investment anymore. There's fantastic short sellers and instances over time where I've learned from a short thesis and gotten out. There's times where I haven't broadly agreed, but maybe I looked at an aspect of the company differently and that helps. People have to be open to other people's opinions that are different from theirs and possibly learning something. And sometimes a short call will give you an opportunity to buy more lower. How many times have people gone on message boards to go ""OMG SHORT SELLERS EVIL!"" after a short report takes something lower rather than take the opportunity to go, ""thank you"" and buy more? 

Short sellers aren't going to be right all the time either, but this sort of ""fingers in ears"" reaction when people hear anything negative about the stock they own and ""it's all a hedge fund conspiracy"" any time their stock is down is not going to be helpful to anyone, at all, ever.

843,PFE," Shorting is pretty necessary. Most of the big financial frauds were uncovered due to shorts. Auditors don't have the financial incentive to do so, so shorts are not only here to stay but play an incredibly important role to find the markets.

I have asked around for examples by companies that were ruined by shortsellers and no one could name me one. Most of the time one only short if there is a specific reason since the upside is only 100% and the downside is potentially infinite.

&#x200B;

Regarding PFE. They didn't save the world. Other companies also brought a vacccine. Also that vaccine as important as it is won't make PFE a lot of money, since slapping a huge markup on it would be PR suicide. They have a pretty low growht and their PE ratio of 20 is higher than their average of 13. So they were valued quite high  - historically speaking.

844,PFE," You should start with the question: what is the evidence that ""shorts"" are pushing price down?

Follow-up: can a fundamentally sound company be destroyed by stock price movements?

With regard to $PFE: current price is back to the highs of 2020, aside from the December runup. Who's to say this is not the ""correct"" market price now?

And about the pandemic: near the end of last year there was quite some exuberance about it getting defeated by early this year. Realization is now settling in that this is not going to be simple nor quick. So that also plays a role, an outsized one with vaccine makers like PFE.

 Stock moves are usually affected more by deviation from expectations than by absolute performance alone.

How much money do you think Robinhood (and similar) account holders were putting into GME?  With very few exceptions, that's kids buying 5 or 10 shares (or less).  We're talking *maybe* millions of dollars of purchases running through RH.  Not hundreds of millions and certainly not billions.  The restrictions that RH put in place had little, if any, impact on the price.

> Because lets not forget, Institutions own over 100% of the shares.

**Owned**, not own.  Mutual funds only report their ownership every 30 days.  So the institutional ownership information you're looking at is based upon holdings on either 09/30/20 or 12/31/20.  That's funds that bought in at less than $30 (and probably less than $20).  You think they didn't sell at some point between $100 and $480?

Those guys are professional investors, not d.i.a.m.o.n.d handed a.p.e.s.  There were the idiots left holding the bag.

Hell, it may not even be up a person. There must have been algorithms that watches for stock trend and triggers a sell order when certain conditions are met. Most common would be something like if the trailing 5 trading sessions peak has a positive slope, hold. It the peak had a negative slope above a certain value, sell. 

The wsb argument would be that if retail investors actually own that much of GME and they hold, then the shorters can never cover until price gets bid up.

Then the counter to that is if the original shorts have all covered in the run up from $4 to $20, and all the news shorts were at $300 to $480 range, then yeah, they don't care about paying interest on the stock when the value is at $90 or below. 

Personally, I also believe that the original, most painful shorts have already covered. Any retail investors that came in after the stock price moved above $40 are left holding the bag.

860,GME," As others already mentioned please take a few financial clases but here is the gist of it.

Who do you think uncovered that Nikola  is a fraud  -  yep it was  a short seller.

A short can be more than 100%.  This is just like the bank that lends money to their customers. u/TheGoodBunny made a great example.

They didn't risk the entire financial system. One outcome was just as we saw, that some funds had to cover their position (but probably made more on the way down or recouped the cost) and that some funds who already were in GME made a lot of money.

The alternative was that GME goes bankrupt.  Something that has been talked about since at least 2017. So the shorts would made money there while other made losses or  that it went up a little bit, making a few loses for the shorts and a few gains for the longs. A normal day at the stock market so to speak.

Robinhood restricted trades to protect itself from liquidity problems and for their own risk management. It is not about manipulating the market but rather to protect itself from bankruptcy (something that happend a lot in 1929 when the stocks crashed with brokerage houses - look it up). Following regulations is expensive. There is a reason why the good brokers (most of which you pay for in either monthly or trading fees) didnt stop trading.

I would say that most of the people on Wall Street have America's best interest at heart. They don't want to fail their nation, they want it to prosper and make money in the stock market.
