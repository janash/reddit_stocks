4,DD," Thank you. i needed to hear this today. i've spent the morning looking at a variety of new-to-me stocks in different sectors than I've been investing in. i made a watchlist w 30 or so new ideas i got from news and world reports best stock lists, and over the weekend plan to do DD in order to cull it down to five stocks that I could buy Monday.  rotate out of the stocks in my portfolio that are fundamentally flawed if I need to, or use the cash cushion i've been saving for the next market ""sale.""  Or stay the course, but with a few new stock ideas in my back pocket. 

For what it's worth, I enjoyed going through their best stock lists in different categories, because they are easy to compare, and different from what I seem to keep buying.  

But the lightbulb turned on when I realized that I was doing my own research, and not using a news media cnbc talking head's advice, or an email or other media that keeps screaming at me every day "" Buy this!!"" ""Sell this!!""  ""It's the end of the world!!""  Like you, if I had kept my original basket of stocks I picked last year, most if not all have since doubled, so even if they go down 10-20%, I'd still be up.  Instead, I chose to ride the FOMO YOLO train, and while I still have my original capital, am down   40% to date.

 i appreciate your post. i still needed the validation today. feeling like I'm in a better place and on the right track.  We'll see.

47,AMD," Really depends on what you buy which is why as a general guideline, I've stated that if you don't see the company being sustainable for the long-term, it's best to just liquidate or remove it from your portfolio and focus on other companies that you believe will. What is high now would be considered a 'you're so lucky to have bought in at a low price' 2-3 years from now and certainly, a decade later. I remember when people thought Apple was high 3 years ago or when people said AMD was too high at $20 just a year ago. Obviously I can't tell you what to do if you bought high and have seen the market crash into a bloodbath. What I can do is suggest to you that stocks, in the general sense, do keep going higher because regardless of what you think, sustainable companies aren't focused on the stock market as much as you think from a technicality perspective. They're focused on creating products and services.

Like I've stated, if you own risky plays such as PLUGPOWER or BLNK and you bought high, there's no advice I can really give you since you basically got the worst of both sticks. The people who should be worried are those who bought risky stocks at ATH's. If you bought a stock at a ATH but the company is sustainable and will continue to exist for years (which you should've researched and would have more info about before investing), then don't worry too much about it. Sure, time the market if you want. It's your decision. Maybe you get the same shares back at a lower basis but maybe you don't. Maybe the shares rise 30% within a week and you're still trying to get back in but don't. All I can say is do what makes you the most comfortable AFTER doing your due diligence.

I won't knock you for that but that's simply the risk you had to take as a student trying to enter the stock market. I don't know what companies you own. Like I've stated, if you own risky plays such as PLUGPOWER or BLNK and you bought high, there's no advice I can really give you since you basically got the worst of both sticks. The people who should be worried are those who bought risky stocks at ATH's. If you bought a stock at a ATH but the company is sustainable and will continue to exist for years (which you should've researched and would have more info about before investing), then don't worry too much about it. Sure, time the market if you want. It's your decision. Maybe you get the same shares back at a lower basis but maybe you don't. Maybe the shares rise 30% within a week and you're still trying to get back in but don't. All I can say is do what makes you the most comfortable AFTER doing your due diligence.

119,CTXR," I disagree. If you're down 25%, you invested in stocks that can be volatile (both good and bad) and will likely make up the 25% in months, not a year. Some stocks won't rebound, so monitor and cut losses where you need to, but the good stocks will be fine. Temporary dip, paper loss, all that jazz.

Also, I didn't actively invest in 2020, just put money into my 401k and it directed it to mutual funds that I selected, and I made 22% even counting the crash in March. The market isn't rigged against us, just volatile, so try to be patient. You'll get the money back quickly I think. 

Also, picking individual stocks is much harder than index funds, ETF or mutual funds. If you're risk averse, try those (although I'd wait until you make the 25% back. Don't sell and switch positions, just redirect future contributions to the safer investments).

While you have a point about throwing good money after bad, it depends on the stock. For example, I believe in CTXR and think it will hit $3-4 by April. My cost basis had been $2.35, and it dropped all the way down to $1.5 today. I bought enough that my new cost basis is $2.02, which is its floor, IMO (when the market rebounds). It's already up to $1.72 and I expect it to hit $2 next week. In addition to letting me sell for profit anywhere above $2.02 (instead of having to wait for it to spike to $2.35), I'm also recouping some of my losses on the way up. So I'll break even quicker than if I left it, and if it goes up to $3-4 like I expect, I'll make more in profit overall.",PsycheRevived,1,/r/stocks/comments/ly3cei/heres_a_thought_for_tomorrow/gpt72h5/,0.08,0.828,0.092,0.7132

For example, there are a shit ton of growth stocks that have spike up hard but the companies literally do not turn a profit at all. Negative revenue. Why do people buy them? Because they are the stocks of the future, so as long as they are growing, eventually they'll figure out how to turn a profit (eg Tesla only turned a profit last year for the first time; DoorDash has never made a profit). This is growth stocks. NIO went from $4 to $80 or some shit in a few months (I cashed in). Its earnings do not justify that at all. Many growth stocks have negative revenue, yet they've gone up 200% this last year.

So, IF inflation is actually coming as many investors fear, it means that the future dollar will be less valuable.

While I did omit the guidance from the DD, I believe that their guidance is still a strong goal. Oftentimes their estimate is lower than they expect in order for earnings to look better. I believe that in a few years, they will exceed expectations.

There still may be some downwards momentum left in the stock, which will provide ample opportunity to buy low.

> LOGI, their most comparable competitor 

While it is true that Logitech produces a lot of peripherals and streaming equipment, a majority of Corsair's revenue is from PC components such as RAM, PSUs, Cases, Coolers, Fans, etc. They have plenty of competitors there too, my speculation though, is that Corsair will come out on top.

> CRSR IS TRADING AT THE SAME PE AS AAPL 

I never really mentioned Apple. I mentioned the average PE ratio of the entire computer components and hardware sectors though(36). PE ratio is a good way to tell if a stock is under or overvalued, but one thing you have to consider when using PE ratio is the ratio of the sector. The PE ratio gives an investor an idea of what other investors are willing to pay for a company's earnings. If a sector shows a lot of promise, odds are the PE ratios will be higher. In Apple's example, the PE ratio of the consumer electronics sector is around 24, and Apple's PE ratio is 31. That isn't to say that Apple is overvalued, it means that Apple over-performs compared to its sector, it's a blue-chip stock.

In Apple's example, the PE ratio of the consumer electronics sector is around 24, and Apple's PE ratio is 31. That isn't to say that Apple is overvalued, it means that Apple over-performs compared to its sector, it's a blue-chip stock.

>  **THE ONLY REASON CRSR IS VALUED SO HIGH IS BECAUSE IT IPO'D IN 2020.** 

Very true. After Corsair peaked at $51.26, we saw a huge correction down to the price it is at currently, and it is very possible it will continue down for a while. I believe that the market has overcorrected and that Corsair's true value lays above the price that it is now.

> CRSR is only a good value play under $25, you're lying to yourself 

You might be right. Disagreements in speculation are what allow the market to function.",RubiksPoint,10,/r/stocks/comments/lxvvwr/corsair_due_diligence_crsr/gpqcgwf/,0.04,0.842,0.119,0.9806
223,SO," > completely ignores their own guidance 

While I did omit the guidance from the DD, I believe that their guidance is still a strong goal. Oftentimes their estimate is lower than they expect in order for earnings to look better. I believe that in a few years, they will exceed expectations.

There still may be some downwards momentum left in the stock, which will provide ample opportunity to buy low.

> LOGI, their most comparable competitor 

While it is true that Logitech produces a lot of peripherals and streaming equipment, a majority of Corsair's revenue is from PC components such as RAM, PSUs, Cases, Coolers, Fans, etc. They have plenty of competitors there too, my speculation though, is that Corsair will come out on top.

> CRSR IS TRADING AT THE SAME PE AS AAPL 

I never really mentioned Apple. I mentioned the average PE ratio of the entire computer components and hardware sectors though(36). PE ratio is a good way to tell if a stock is under or overvalued, but one thing you have to consider when using PE ratio is the ratio of the sector. The PE ratio gives an investor an idea of what other investors are willing to pay for a company's earnings. If a sector shows a lot of promise, odds are the PE ratios will be higher.

Why not? Corsair is a market leader in several categories, including RAM memory which is 40% of its sales.

AAPL price to sales is 3 times higher, lower revenue per share, much smaller earning growth yoy,  much higher debt ratios etc.

What's the realistic outlook for AAPL in the next 10 years ? 2x if they make great buys/plays at maximum.

Corsair has tons of growth opportunity within the markets they dominate atm. AAPL has a lot stiffer competition.

519,AI," It's a great company. I heard about it because it has been advertising on NPR for a very long time.

Take a look at their partners: https://c3dti.ai/

A bunch of big universities, Microsoft, etc.

They IPO'd in December and I bought that morning at $94, it quickly went way up and I sold around $150. That was too high for such a new IPO.

But ever since I've been waiting for a big drop because this is a long-term hold for me, which happened this week with a ""meh"" earnings report (their first one, not a big deal) coupled with the tech correction. 

Price is below the IPO and it's a perfect time to jump back in if you ask me. I bought back in today but I'm sure it's going to keep dropping & I'll keep buying. It's flown under the radar because it isn't very sexy but I think it's a good investment.

Keep it on your radar! I almost never buy individual stocks (I'm an ETF guy) but I really like the potential for this one. AI is going to be huge for companies in the next few years.",vacchagotta_on_fire,6,/r/stocks/comments/lxydzc/what_stocks_did_you_buy_today/gpqgxwk/,0.023,0.877,0.1,0.9464

Eman is a weird stock. It's like VUZI.   Its poised to pop and was rising until today.  The $4 share price makes me feel like a big shot buying high numbers of shares.   I bought a bunch of really cheap calls (3/19 & 4/16 $7.50) on Monday and then bought the same amount for half price today.  Crazy volatility for very limited price range options.  80% owned by institutions but it also has an ultra high ""indicative borrow rate"" which I don't fully understand but am guessing hedge funds trying to short it or there aren't enough shares to offset options?

524,SNOW," I don't know if this is the correct way to do things. I'm sure someone will agree and someone else will say this is the worst. This is what I do. 

The taxable account is not my emergency fund, but it's there if needed. If not needed, we expect (hope?) to liquidate it in 2 years. So basically, it's where I park money until I need/want it. 

Taxable = high dividends, experiments, and as we (if we) confirm the two year goal (buying a house) then things get sold and moved into a less risky equity and eventually moved to an FDIC account. Note: Everyone and their dog will tell you that if you want to use the money in 5 years or less, don't have it in the stock market.

Trad. IRA = not worried about dividends, looking for growth and/or price stability. I have one speculative position where I'm very long on it. This is where I put companies that I really believe in like: Chewy, Amazon, SNOW. This is where I put companies that I shop with and have for a long time and a few select experiments. 

Roth IRA = Same as the Trad, but with a dividend focus and a few experiments that have good dividends. I have Google in the Roth despite them not having a dividend. I didn't want Amazon and Google in the same account for no good reason. 

My Roth is about 3 times the size of my other two. The Taxable has the best short term performance. The Roth has the best long term performance. The Trad is slower growing and more stable. This is what I was aiming for so maybe I'm doing it right.

Everything can go down at once If you believe every single asset class will drop than cash is the best investment. 

Between 2007 and 2011, cash outperformed the MSCI Global share index, SP500, and Global Property Index. Property beat cash only in 2011, and that year did not make up for the bloodbath during the GFC. The only asset to outperform cash over the five years was bonds.

565,BYD," Hate to break it to you, but NIO is probably going to sub $5. Why do I think this?

1. NIO does not have a factory. When they get orders, it subcontracts it out to another company to build the car. What does NIO REALLY OWN? It owns the specs to a few cars, granted the cars are pretty nice, and it owns a couple of really fancy show rooms.
2. NIO only sells in China right now, and there is no excitement for NIO cars IN CHINA. I spent a few months in China interviewing car enthusiast in early 2019. No one cares or thinks about NIO. They're into Teslas for higher end, and the normal commuter/taxi drivers buy BYD (think Chinese Toyota Camry). I was at the Shanghai auto show, and the line was around the room for Tesla, BMW, Mercedes EV's, even though they were concept cars. The section for NIO was pretty much empty.

BTW Warren Buffet DOES own a heavy % of BYD.

3) Their work on Solid State Batteries is a joke. They simply do not have the engineers to win this race. It's going to be won by CATL, Toyota, LG Chem, Samsung, or Panasonic.

4) NIO does not make money on their cars. The more cars they sell, the more negative their profits are! They do not have an excuse like capital investment. They're not building any factories or anything. Their only play is to try to get into the EU market so they can sell Carbon Credits to other car companies. Guess what, EVERYONE is trying to get into the EU market.

SO, forget the history of the price, just based on a company like this, how much DO YOU think the company is worth overall? I think $1B-$4B is being fair/generous.

Well with 1.2B shares outstanding, that's looking like $1 - $3 per share.

Additionally, all relevant recommendations and holdings are disclosed in every article, so it’s not like they are trying to manipulate anything. They also share every recommendation that they have ever made with their paid subscribers, with dates, prices, and returns vs benchmark.

Dividend announcement In accordance with the new dividend policy announced in the report for second quarter2020, the Board of North Energy intends to distribute a dividend of NOK 0.45 per share to shareholders. The proposed dividend will be made as a redemption of paid-in capital and is subject to approval at the AGM in April 2021.

New dividend policy. The Board has resolved to establish a regular dividend policy to be based on the annual profits generated by the operating activities of the Company. Subject to available liquidity and financial position, the Company intends to distribute an annual dividend in an amount equal to 40-60% of net profits. The new dividend policy will be in effect from fiscal year 2020 with the first dividend expected to be paid out after the next annual general meeting to be held in 2021. Following the resolution of the outstanding tax matters, the Company has a strong financial platform and a solid foundation for executing its strategy as an industrial investment company. Going forward, available financial funds are expected to be deployed to support this core strategy.

\> ""Company intends to distribute an annual dividend in an amount equal to 40-60% of net profits.""

Share is 3,4 NOK. Dividend is 0,45 NOK/share.

It's Norway. Not Venezuela. They follow rules.

I haven't looked into Byggma (30% dividend), but I'd be wary of buying it due to the sudden spike in share price. But they'll definitely be paying the 80 NOK/share. Question is just if their share price remains the same.

639,RKT," Think of it like Coke and Pepsi.  When was the last time you've gone into a restaurant and they had both on tap?

Also, it's a dumb move.  UWM doesn't have any sort of leverage in the market to make it a worth-while play.  Plus, RKT is making it a goal to keep increasing their wholesale channel penetration.  Thirdly, like I've said in other comments: the mortgage origination business is heavily fragmented.  While QL leads in market share, they're only at 6%.  UWM blocking them from 1.5% of the market that only contributes 25% of their originations is nothing.

And for the consumer, ~~imagine if you found an independent insurance broker/agent but they *only* worked with Geico; it kind of defeats the purpose of going to a broker.~~ it's still not the best as it silos their choice.  One broker uses QL, another uses UWM, and another uses FIM but they all then use Wells Fargo, BoA, Loan Depot, etc.

656,IMO," When you buy is depends a lot on how much information you have about what's causing the selling and what's driving the markets at the time. Because everyone has different levels of information and different signals that they're keying on, they can have different timing.

Personally, I feel that a lot of the selling is structural. People sell in March to raise money to pay capital gains taxes after a year in which they made a lot of money in the market, and so March following a big market year can see a lot of selling. The end of March is also the end of the quarter and institutional and pension funds have to rebalance their portfolios and do whatever overhaul they need to do for the next quarter. Because there was such a big run-up in tech and some other stocks that grew because of the pandemic, preparing for a post-pandemic portfolio might involve selling a lot of those stocks that were successful in 2020. Also, there's the fact that a lot of the stock that were successful in 2020 were so successful that they are overvalued, and there are other stocks that have room to grow as we emerge from the pandemic. That will lead to a big selloff of 2020 stocks so that people can buy stocks that will grow in reopening the economy. 

For these reasons, I feel that a lot of the selling is structural and to be expected, and that it will continue (either continuously or sporadically) until the end of March. 

I absolutely agree that people should be looking at the market every day and searching for bargains. I don't that people should use up all their cash right now. They'll have time to shop over the next 2-4 weeks, IMO.",rhetorical_twix,1,/r/stocks/comments/ly8vfc/invest_more_at_current_prices/gpsoqaq/,0.005,0.939,0.056,0.945

670,NET," I have been around since the early 1980's.  Remember the 1987 crash?  Asian Contagion, Dot Com Bubble?  2003?, 2008?  

I don't believe anyone can time the markets in the short term.  If they really could, they would be the wealthiest guy on the planet.  Lots of people can get lucky for a short period of time.  It's like option traders.  There are tons of people who can show you a big win.  There are an extreme few who can show you a NET profit over years and decades.  I personally never met one in 40 years of this business. (I am now  retired). 

I use moving average crosses to ""time the markets"" but I learned early on, short term moving  averages give too many unprofitable whipsaws.  My moving averages are 220 days over 440 days.  It kept me out of the stock market from 2002 until 2013 and in gold.  (Gold outperformed stocks from the bottom in  2009 until 2013)  They give me long term trend moves with few whipsaws.  

If you think about anyone who says they can time the markets in the short term, ask them if they think the market will rise or fall tomorrow.  How about on Monday two weeks from now?  It just ain't possible for any real length of time.",DowGoldRatio,1,/r/stocks/comments/lyfzs0/bear_market_has_begun_insiders_are_unloading/gpt3tlh/,0.018,0.931,0.051,0.7359

702,USA," Solar is getting punished because it's a growth stock, and increasing interest rates or inflation hit growth stocks in general.  In the case of solar those factors *slightly* reduce the profits for solar projects.   Solar has been riding high the last few months, resulting in valuations being a bit high, and is historically a bit volatile so this hits them disproportionately. 

What people haven't factored in is how small that the interest rate impact is at normal market rates -- and the fact that historically solar managed to grow rapidly even in a higher-rate environment.  Plus the Fed and other central banks are promising a sustained low-rate climate for at least the next year. The market has been following a herd mentality and panicking, but that panic means that some sectors get driven down when they shouldn't be because investors are painting with an overly broad-brush approach.

Renewables are BOTH the future AND the present. Many people, including the big whales, just haven't moved past 2010-era assumptions about renewable energy though. The reality is that [renewables already comprise most of the new generating capacity being installed in the USA in 2021](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=46416)... with solar taking the lion's share (40% of new capacity), and the US is actually one of the big laggards in renewables.  Those projects were planned under the most anti-renewables presidential administration in decades, so we're not seeing the impact of Biden policies yet.

The story is even more compelling in Europe, China, India, etc.  Solar and wind are profit makers with strong fundamental growth right now (a history of more than 15-20% y/y growth pretty steadily, sometimes vastly higher than that). 

With the vaccine rolling out and likely an extremely favorable regulatory climate the US is positioned for a solar boom.  Residential and commercial solar is particularly likely to grow in particular, since that has been suppressed by the pandemic.  Plus potential infrastructure spending may add an extra boost.  Finally scares about powergrid stability in Texas may favor residential/commercial solar installations.

If you trust your thesis and it is correct, eventually the market will correct itself and you will reap the benefits of your work and patience. Don't be spooked by a downturn. If you really believe in a company then the stock going down should only give you more reasons to buy. Personally I think the market are efficient in the long run (5-10 years), but in the short term there are plenty of inefficiencies that can be exploited. These inefficiencies exist because of our cognitive biases, and because most people make decisions based on emotions and not math or reason. If you are able to stomach a market downturn and follow the strategy that adheres to your thesis, you will reap the rewards sooner or later.

Yes, and Texas has phenomenal solar energy potential (the climate is right for it).   I see limited grid penetration as a good, not a bad thing, because that means there's a huge amount of growth potential in the unaddressed market.  

> Solar companies have a lot of room to fall if we take just current fundamentals into account (though some more than others, such as ENPH),

It depends on if you're looking at trailing P/E (standard) or forward P/E.  ENPH has a trailing of P/E of 144 but a forward P/E of 50.22.  SEDG has a trailing P/E of 89.95 but a forward P/E of 38.24. 

What looks like a very high valuation based on historic data suddenly looks much more reasonable if you factor in the ongoing growth and expected sales... and if you factor in that green government policies and pro-renewable policy shifts may benefit the companies, then it becomes quite possible they'll beat currently expected earnings. 

High-growth companies are harder to value appropriately, and trailing metrics really downplay their present-market value.

During quarantine, I started dabbling in options trading. After enough articles from TheVerge about self-proclaimed idiots who eat crayons making millions, I put $5,000 into a Robinhood account. Then the worst thing that could happen happened - I made money on my first 8 options trades. A lot. Which I thought meant I was a genius with previously untapped instincts. Then I bought 8 more options that all ended valueless. I'm not a genius.

I decided it'd be smart to read about smart options traders. I switched from naked calls to call spreads, long puts to put spreads, and even dabbled in synthetic longs and diagonals. I still don't know what an Iron Condor is.

821,GME," I legitimately believe that the real reason for the crash is Reddit.

I get that there's a speculative bubble and bond yields are up, but nobody carried about the speculative bubble or started moving their assets into bonds until the whole GME fiasco.

The first big dip of this crash happened on Jan. 27th, when GME skyrocketed to inexplicable heights and became a major news story.

The market began recovering on Feb. 1st, when Robinhood halted trading on GME and sent it down.

Things were normal after that. There was a downward fluctuation before the Game Stopped hearing, but it was still within normal fluctuations. We didn't break normal fluctuations downward until Feb. 22 -- the first trading day after DeepFuckingValue doubled-down on GME.

It's like Wall Street saw GME wasn't over and all simultaneously said: ""Fuck this, I'm putting my money into bonds.""",wsb_shitposting,6,/r/stocks/comments/ly92v2/rstocks_daily_discussion_fundamentals_friday_mar/gps9qvw/,0.109,0.838,0.052,-0.8968

>You literally have no idea about the whole point of the deep value play of the company in Keith Gill's original thesis if you think $100 something isn't a fair valuation of where the stock should be under the new leadership structure.

This makes sense over time. Not right now. Even Keith's plays were super long for that reason. What's going on right now has nothing to do with GME's actual valuation and everything to do with gamma/short squeezes that have no real long term support *right now*. 

Even Keith was smart enough to take a good chunk of profit out of GME to the tune of 10-15 mil IIRC and quit his finance job because of it. Dude is literally just playing the rest of the ride for fun at this point with money that really doesn't matter to him and won't significantly change his life at this point. Shit could theoretically drop down to $1 a share at this point(Not that I think it will) and Keith will be doing just fine from that play and will still be a multi millionaire.

911,AAPL," I just posted in another thread about me learning these things first-hand. I have 7k in my brokerage. I wanted 5k invested, and that is all fully invested. My total assets is about 10k. I want 50% invested and about 20% my total assets in cash that is not living buffer. I decided to use my 20% cash reserve to 'buy the dip', but I didn't have a plan for my risk/reward, so I bought before the price was worth it to me based on what I can accomplish by spreading 2k across multiple stocks. On AAPL and QQQ I am ""risking"" an additional $900 that will net me only about $15 extra when prices go back up to where they were over the next month. I was too eager on my buys for my personal valuation of the trades. Since this was to average down, I will be taking that money back out. To me that is not worth it to tie up that $900 for so long. If you are trading 10k then that is a different story and you can multiply that gain many times over and pocket a nice amount. 

Even if that was the bottom of the dip and the stock never went down to that level again, I honestly don't care about cashing out that little amount of money. If an opportunity comes up, then I can decide when it is worth it for me to use my cash to gamble on the reward. If an opportunity never comes up, and the market never dips again, then I don't care, because that 20% is my cash reserve and that is its primary job. I'm not putting 100% of my assets into the market. If I got laid off I would be completely screwed over with no cash. I wouldn't be able to withdraw right now without losing money. Deciding when it is worth it to gamble my cash reserves on a dip is not timing the market and I just think a lot of the advice floating around is really geared towards people with a lot more money and it seems to be a little different if you only have 10k or something.",iwannastonk,2,/r/stocks/comments/lyeyh2/basics_for_new_investors/gpsx5tp/,0.037,0.834,0.129,0.9853

913,AAPL," Ah gotcha. So you would suggest that index funds or even ETFs would be more reliable then even picking from growth stocks? For sure it's easy to see growth from 10+ years out, but why wouldn't it be assured that growth stocks will be ok to invest in something like a year to 2 years? 

I get no one knows the future, but wouldn't it be ideal/safe to buy AAPL (obviously not all in on one stock) for 1-2 year term for a slower growth vs something more unknown or new like PLTR? Especially for someone like me that just wants to safely invest not in the short or super long term.",kitkaht,2,/r/stocks/comments/lyeyh2/basics_for_new_investors/gpsy982/,0.04,0.69,0.27,0.9838
914,AAPL," Well let's look at a best case scenario with VTI. If you bought 25 shares of VTI at their ATL of around $40 in 2009, those 25 shares would now be worth 4925. Or 392% gains over 12 years. Additionally they pay dividends that can fluctuate, so for the purpose of this example let's just set a fixed average at 0.6/share over these 12 years. Or an additional $720, bringing the total to 5645, or 464% gains. 

But let's look at something gaining popularity during my day in 2009, which was AAPL. In 2009 AAPL was worth only 7$ which meant you could've had 142 shares post-split. Those 142 shares would now be worth $17058. I'm sure I don't have to add the dividends considering we are at over 1600% gains already. 

The point I want to make is that time is on your side and VTI is more or less always there. Invest in something relevant today to your peers that you believe has staying power. For me that was AAPL, by 2012 1B smartphones were on the network with AAPL taking a huge market share. Or something like FB(which I didn't invest in), but has shown huge returns as well; but was also an up and coming product during my time growing up.

What do you think will be extremely relevant in 5 years? Invest in that and I don't think you can go wrong tbh. In other words, what to you is the next Apple? Maybe something like VR gaming? Or EVs?",Fireba11jutsu,4,/r/stocks/comments/lxy1v2/my_dad_gave_me_1000_dollars_to_invest_continued/gpq2y3w/,0.02,0.821,0.159,0.9737

Do not get roped into GME. You may be tempted when you go to.. certain subs. Don't do it. 

The idea of the squeeze with GME has always been based on holding long enough for shorts to cover at a price higher than what they paid. It's very volatile, risky, and it's a train that has long passed. 

If you'd like to invest in something and forget it, I'd go the ETF route. 

If you'd like to change investments and follow tickers and catalysts, start researching certain stocks and invest in a variety of things.

916,HUGE," Spend about $80 of it to buy a used copy of “foundations in personal finance” the high school edition on dvd. It teaches you about managing money,  taxes, checking, debt, credit and investments. It is actually really funny and easy to get through.

Then I like the VTI idea you had. Individual stocks are ok to play with but you need to learn the basics and get really interested in WHY you are investing so that you will learn what and when to monitor on the individuals. 
That class will help give you a HUGE boost in that way.

951,IMO," Peloton is a spin bike and spin class replacement. It's not a replacement for riding a bike (something you could do during the pandemic anyway) or going to the gym.

Spin is very popular and typical live classes are either free with a membership at a high end gym (so paying around $100 a month) or you can do something like Soul Cycle for $20-$30 a session depending on where you live. In these instances, the Peloton is the more cost effective option.

The pandemic certainly boosted Peloton sales but their real money maker is the subscription and that will be a consistent source of revenue going forward. Once people pay off their bike a $40 a month sub for the entire household is incredibly reasonable. 

Another thing to note is that Peloton is having supply chain issues that is pushing back deliveries by months. As the pandemic winds down and they can get a bike to someone in a couple of days, that will be a big positive for them.

It's certainly easy to argue that all these pandemic stocks are very overvalued even during the recent drop but a lot of these things are here to stay. IMO, Peloton is one of them and it's because they're not just selling bikes but are selling subscriptions too.",kamrali,5,/r/stocks/comments/lyb222/peloton_complete_due_diligence_pton_has_peloton/gps1iou/,0.033,0.862,0.105,0.9335

957,DDD," I think thats a fair point. ARKG specifically is speculative because genomics hasnt quite taken off yet. However i believe over the next few years those type of holdings will show huge momentum and gains. I personally am bullish there and prior to this correction AKRG had solid gains for me. 

ARKK is also fair to say that. However, the fund has bought huge dips of tesla, roku, sq, teledoc and zillow. Unfortunately besides tesla i own all of those so i know how far those have dipped and saw how quickly they recovered on Friday/ monday too. I think this will be one that bounces the fastest. 

Though i believe ARKF and ARKQ are the best buys right now.

Looking like a very red day. I might see what after hours looks like. If we have dropped 5-7% im thinking off adding to QQQ, QQQJ, VOO, ARKQ, ARKF and potentially PRNT (i actually am fond of this ETF as a half reopening etf due to holdings like DDD, msft, hp, etc.)

961,IMO," It’s my pleasure! Glad you enjoyed.

The basis of fundamental analysis is exactly what you just mentioned. It is inevitable that the strong earnings will be reflected in the stock price at some point in the future. Impossible to know when and high institutional ownership might make it harder for it to gap-up fast, but if the company keeps executing it will happen.

Also, the IPO was fairly recent and skewed the fair value of the company.

Company is also trading at a “premium” and rich valuation, so it’s definitely not a dirt-cheap bargain by any means, but it offers fair value and potential for an attractive return due to its growth prospects IMO.

963,CRSP," Stocks that I was previously looking for dips in but am now afraid of:  
SNAP, CRSP, NNMD, NIO

I was previously sold on their rabid following that showed little weakness, but as others said, the fact that these stocks are down huge for the month and yet still up huge for the year makes it too scary.  

It’s crazy to see how Nio’s market cap grew as much as it did and still ‘reputable’ analysts ignored all fundamental training to back step in and say ‘okay well this is how the can go even higher’. And now no one knows where bottom is on anything. The fact that even airlines and cruise ships are trading higher than pre-covid prices is scary, but it also leads me to believe there’s little pump left in the recovery plays (as they become just as ridiculously valued as tech/WFH), and people will switch back to tech because it’s more exciting and the earnings beats are at least there. Plus, I think all the new retail traders will continue to be drawn in that direction over value. 

My guess (I know no one’s asked, but these days it’s hard not to think about this 24/7), is that sooner than later, big money will start coming back in and push the market to another irrational exuberance frenzy. I think everything can fall further, but not as low as people think it will. Every time I’ve thought “this is the end,” the market says nope, we want what we want. And the snap backs can be just as fast as the falls. So my gut says that buying growth dips will be rewarded big in the near future, and I’ll regret being too scared. But every “correction” becomes more and more complex when the run ups to the correction have been so damn high, so for me, holding what I have is challenging enough, and there’s little I feel compelled to buy dips on, except for a couple DA SPACS (and only because of the asymmetrical risk since they’re at NAV).",jaxpax22,3,/r/stocks/comments/lxxiv7/what_are_you_not_buying_right_now/gpq6xxw/,0.137,0.776,0.087,-0.9495

1064,GM," Part of this drop is just due to the entire market crashing.  

Brain tired so pasting a comment I just left on another post. 

So part of this shortage is due to the kind of chip being made, the supply and demand of the last year, and old technology tools. Lots of chips were made for consumer electronics like PlayStation/compete for rising teleworking at the beginning of COVID, not so much for vehicles.  Vehicles like Ford/GM don’t do internal fab, they outsource and need older style chips (200mm) for reliability (power steering, brakes, engines). It takes 9-12 months to increase production. So there is a lack of this type of tools this creating a decrease in supply. Equipment is classified as either front-end or back-end. Front-end involves silicon wafer fabrication and other various functions, such as photolithography, deposition, etching, cleaning, ion implantation, and chemical & mechanical polishing. Back-end encompasses the assembly, packaging and testing of integrated circuits. 

So not only does this lack of equipment required for production impact smart tech or vehicle manufacturers, but the semiconductor manufacturers/suppliers as well.",theicevalkyrie,2,/r/stocks/comments/lxwqhp/what_is_happening_in_the_semiconductor_industry/gppme28/,0.054,0.873,0.072,0.5145

1080,IMO," If you only have 6 stocks, I strongly recommend diversifying if you're a long term investor, over going deeper into your existing positions. Nothing against your existing positions, but IMO a portfolio with 6 stocks is too fragile. My personal goal is to have at least 15 stocks in at least a few separate sectors. I try not to go too far above that long-term, as keeping track of that many companies isn't tenable.

That said, depends on your total investment. If 6 stocks across a 6k investment -- yeah sure. For a long time my strategy was just to throw 1500 into stocks I liked, and keep my initial investment 1500 (or 3k if I was really excited about a stock -- but keeping it in increments of 1500). As my total investments grew, I raised that number gradually to 5k, so any new buys I have I buy to 5k. But I don't factor in the average cost basis to any of it. I think that's a stupid strategy, frankly, and it gets thrown around a lot. If you like a stock, invest in it. If it was too expensive to invest in before, but you feel it's now in a place where it's not too expensive, buy it. But don't do it deliberately to bring down your cost basis. That's such an arbitrary motive to make a purchase.

While 'diversify more!' is a pretty universal strategy, the exact numbers I cited are all personal choice and YMMV. But hopefully this gives a different perspective.",exveelor,1,/r/stocks/comments/lxziic/diversify_or_is_it_too_late/gpsl0cr/,0.018,0.867,0.115,0.9703

Because the hedge funds manipulated the price down to get a better position in the market. Then once you were scared and selling your stock- they buy it from you.

I WILL TELL YOU WHAT YOU DO

I actually think you are wrong about timing the market.  You will never hit the exact top or the exact bottom but I really don't have to. 

Here is an example if two people are both in the same stock SHOP for example down 24 percent in the last 2 weekd.  I have already saved a 20 percent decrease over someone that has held on as of yesterday. Even if I miss the exact bottom by 10 percent I am still ahead of someone who held.  

I do know that Institutional investors and hedge funds don't just sit around during a drop. They move money from the losers to what they feel are the best play. 

NVDA is getting hammered in the last few weeks but their earnings are stellar. Its down 20 percent from the high before earnings. 6bn last quarter which was a 2bn increase. Their fundamentals and future earnings are amazing. NVDA stock dropping is insane. There is no logical reason for it being down

The only reason it's down is because demand for the stock has decreased.  It's not because the earnings are poor its just that the Institutional investors moved out of the tech sector. I am just following the whales cause that's where you make money.  

Here is where Institutional investors are putting their money.  Energy stocks, utilities, consumer staples, and communication services are all trading in the green in this nervous environment. Tech stocks are clearly in the red.

1171,XOM," Tech stocks carry a hefty P/E. You are paying that premium because they are going to be your biggest growth. 

I had 800x gains on Shop and 600x NVDA. They are both getting bludgeoned to death despite the fact they both beat last earnings by stellar amounts.  They should be going through the roof and it's insane that they are not.  I took profits a few weeks ago on all my tech stocks because of these articles

Unfortunately the markets don't anyways work the way we think they should. Earnings don't move stock price nearly as much as positive volume. When people are standing in line to get something you can name your price. 

The big institutions have pulled out and rebalanced into other things. I am just a small fish in an ocean.  If you want to feed go where the whales go. That's just a fact of life.

1175,BIG," I think this is the decade of the battery. 

That being said, batteries go beyond just EV's and I think that there's a wider market for solid state and flow batteries in the coming years. Sure, cars will run increasingly on electricity, but how about batteries that, when combined to wind and solar energy production, will power entire towns? How about battery-powered ships?

It's true that EV's are going to be around, but I've got my eye on the vanadium redox flow battery. Just gotta think past cars and think BIG. 

A vanadium redox flow battery isn't practical for a small vehicle because it takes a lot of space, but it can easily be used to store power from renewable energy. It is safe, as in: doesn't heat up, it's usable for 20-30 years and doesn't degrade even if it's not used for long periods of time.

1180,TSLA," Well... this is an ETF question in the stocks sub, so there’s that. 

However, let me say this. I like ARK family ETFs, but they should absolutely not, in my non financial advice opinion, the whole basket. VOO, index funds, etc should be a relatively safe bet in addition to things like bonds (I know, boring). But ARK is all about disruption. You may believe that Woods is just better at risk than you are, but it’s still an ETF based entirely on 5-10 year projections. If the magic 8 ball is wrong, you’re screwed. 

Finally, look at what they’re buying and selling. I think ARKK biggest holding is TSLA. Something like 10% of the fund. So if TSLA drops (as it is) ARKK drops too. They’re heavy in a few stocks. 

My method is to stash $50k in savings, then move $50k into a holding account that I inject into the market when it corrects.

1193,DD," I’m not personally heavily invested in green energy myself so take this with a grain of salt as I haven’t done any deep dive research, but here’s my quick analysis of the sector:

1) green energy got lumped in with tech and other growth stocks as the future - the most hyped sector and thus the one with largest potential downfall too

2) More hype from the recent Biden election

3) Realistically the world still has many years to go before fossil fuels are replaced at a meaningful level, but once they are green energy will pave the way

All in all the energy sector is a safe one for the future, the only question is the timeframe.  We could see heavy rollouts within a few years, or it may be a decade or two.

If I were you, I'd do some more DD on the stocks you've picked. See if they are actually good companies you believe in. You can search the forums for the opinions of others too because it can be overwhelming. However, make the final decision for yourself.

If I believed in those companies after proper DD, I would hold those positions and not check for a few months. If I didn't, I would dump the ones I don't think have a real future and either average down on the others or pull that money out completely. 

You have done well. Don't let a correction that's affecting everyone make you feel like shit. You are still up and you're learning a lot. Start thinking of reasons to be proud of yourself.

1245,DM," As someone who struggles with serious depression myself, I know the way out of this hole and if you follow me, you can get out too. 

Something I learned in Dialectical Behavior Therapy is to check the facts. Do the facts warrant the seriousness of my emotional reaction? Well, we know how we feel - shitty. So let’s check the facts. The market is dropping. It’s very red. Red is bad. Our balance is hemorrhaging. It looks like we may lose it all. HOWEVER - that’s not actually true. We haven’t lost everything, because we still own the stocks. 

Historically, the market has more than recovered after every correction or crash. Sure, some companies zero out and you actually do lose all of what you put into them. Otherwise, as long as you don’t sell at a huge loss, you have historical data to support this undisputed fact - it will get better. 

So now I’ve aligned my emotions with the facts. Let’s take it to the next level now. 

Does this emotional event present an opportunity? Well, do you have cash available? If you’re locked up already with no free cash, do nothing. However, if you have some extra cash... look for buys. Yes, buy more. Do the opposite of what your emotions tells you (also a DBT technique). If you find a stock that you feel is at a discount now, scoop it up. That way, when the market does inevitably rebound, you’ll be in an even better position than you were. 

Look, life should be long. Try not to measure success or failure in weeks or months. I hope to have a few mil by the time I’m 60-65. I’ll need a lot to help me along the way, but history tells me that if I keep sinking cash in when stuff is low that I’ll get to my destination in the end.

1278,CCL," Look at the cruise ships bookings.  They’re heavily booked.  D&B, Chuck’e’Cheese, Vegas in general are going to be packed.  Travel resorts in the Caribbean have heavy bookings.  Theaters are gonna be busy.  Not everyone wants to be isolated at home.

I just looked to book a Maldives trip in September for the wife’s birthday.  Two of the resorts I was looking at are sold out already, because people are planning to get back to life and also taking advantage of the sale prices.  I’m medical, got my shots already.  Wife should start hers next week.  The minis are gonna be a while until they get through all the pediatric trials down to their age but would be staying with the grandparents that week.
