0,RBLX," I invested my sons (8M) birthday money in bitcoin for him after he watched a vid on YouTube and thought it would make it rich. It went from like 18k-40k, so he learned that he can listen to stupid shit on the internet and make boatloads of cash. 

He then reinvested everything in RBLX @ $102 and it taught him that even a good product can still have a terrible business model and poor valuation. He was hoping to buy lots robux with the profits but now he just begs me for money so he can get some swag. 

Not sure yet whether I'm teaching him investing fundamentals, or preparing him for mod status on WSB",UPGnome,2,/r/investing/comments/11ukzox/teaching_kids_about_investing/jcqk69u/,0.091,0.829,0.081,-0.2944

Because you pay taxes on net gains in a tax year, you can offset losses with other gains. If you have a net loss, you can deduct up to $3000 (if filing single) against ordinary income. You can carry over the remainder of your losses to future tax years.
