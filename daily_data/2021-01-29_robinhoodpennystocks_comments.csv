238,GME," I am with you. I watched as others made money(if they get out at the right times) .   


But if this is all correct, how can there not be money to be had?  if someone smarter than me can explain where I am wrong, I would love to know. I am new and like I said, I didnt get in in the beginning.   


I dont think the hedge funds have learned their lessons. If you can believe the news, GME is still shorted by over 100%.   
From CNBC - 

*  **Short-selling hedge funds have suffered a mark-to-market loss of $19.75 billion year to date in the brick-and-mortar video game retailer GameStop, according to data from S3 Partners.**
* **Still, short sellers mostly are holding onto their bearish positions or they are being replaced by new hedge funds willing to bet against the stock.**
* **GameStop shares that have been borrowed and sold short have declined by just about 5 million over the last week, marking an 8% dip in the short interest, according to S3.**
* **Most of the short covering occurred on Thursday, when the stock fell for the first time in six days.**

239,SBUX," Nah, Elizabeth Warren(who i wanted for president) is righting a letter to the SEC saying its not fair. The people in the stock market benefit way more than the company's workers ever will. 

They are going to change leverage rules. Robinhood may be insolvent at this moment, you can only buy one share of SBUX for instance. Imagine how many call options expired in the money or were assigned and people couldnt cover.

They are most likely going to make companies have more money on hand to cover all these leveraged positions, which means companies will just not give us much if any leverage.

a stock that I haven’t heard much talk about is $SOS, a Chinese company focused on IoT, cloud computing, and \*blockchain\* currently at $2.50. 

i’ve looked into it a bit and it has similar trends to $MARA and $RIOT, two other blockchain-specialized companies that have boomed in the last three months. $SOS is currently sitting where they were in November, before each of them hit at least $20. 

i’m currently aiming for a low target of $8 for $SOS, but I think $20+ could be in the cards. Another interesting thing about the company - its short volume ratio of 27%. It’s heavily shorted in a situation reminiscent to $GME, which means all it needs is some volume to serve as rocket fuel before takeoff. It’s steadily been on the rise in recent weeks, highly encourage other people to research SOS Limited and consider buying!",rutfrosh,25,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/l7eld4/daily_discussion_thread/gl6atty/,0.041,0.89,0.069,0.7492

Weinstein then tweets it and possibly sends it directly to Joe Rogan.

This would validate Rogan’s friend’s credibility after people were discrediting Weinstein for saying it came from a lab.

Part of their phase 2 Endoxifen is done but I don’t see published results. If they have really promising data that could more than double it. For reference, the company I work for had promising phase 2 and our stock went from 1$>9$ in one day. It was for more broad tumor than breast cancer but regardless that’s how much impact it can have.

841,DD," You need to do some reading, brother. Their shares were never worth the equivalent of $3000. They are diluting their value via splits. So you can't pitch this as an underdog story where a company lost value and is just ready for someone to believe in them again. And there's absolutely nothing here that would suggest they are going to improve, let alone reach some comical valuation like $10, let alone $100. 

Literally all you've done as DD is repeat things they are working on without any information about why we should expect it to succeed.

853,GME, I’m able to buy nok shares up to 5 bb shares up to 5 and GME up to 1 I can sell all of mine but I can only buy that many shares currently on robinhood. My guess is people are holding so price trades flat add in that the volume is low compared to yesterday since many people can’t buy very many shares and most are just holding along with people probably selling for a loss the price is slowly dipping. It is cheaper now than it was yesterday you can decide if it’s good to buy rn for yourself that’s my guess tho and as people transfer from robinhood or they let us buy more the price I assume would steadily increase if that happens. I am not a financial advisor and I make no recommendations for you or your financials that’s just a thought,SirDavidDAR,1,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/l823xd/anyone_see_that_spike_and_crash_on_nok_anyone/gla4ei1/,0.056,0.841,0.103,0.7351
