28,DD," $BLGO all the revenue numbers indicate that explosive growth is happening. 

Full year 2021 = $2.5 Million revenue 

First half of 2022 = $ 2.3 Million revenue 

Second half of 2022 = $ 3.45 Million revenue. 

Q1 2023 Company projection = $ 3.85 Million Revenue

And we just learned that the revenue driver POOPH -  is rolling out Q 2 to all Walmart locations and 10k more retail locations while it just became a bestseller on Chewy, Walmart online and Amazon. Growth is expected to continue.
A new Battery Tech and BioLargo Energy Technologies, Inc. (""BETI"") subsidiary with secured seed capital was just added to the Value.

just before it hits positive cash flow.

31,THMO," Not only that but 5000 shares and 2000 shares orders placed don‚Äôt do anything to the price but a 100 order sell will drop it by a penny. The algorithms are jacked and also are ran on algos. I noticed this when I was literally staring at a stock I wanted in the top 15% of the day. It was running up and down and going further down and up each time. It was 3.66 a share & spent every penny I had left which was $395.28 to trade. I spent all my $ that day. I was about to sell at 3:59 and missed. The stock tripled after hours, immediately after close and kept going up and was on the same algorithm so I knew what limit price to put and made about 73% on the trade vs about 50%. Completely a serendipitous moment. It continued into the morning, but sold before close. THMO on 3/15. Sold for $687.08 profiting 291.80. I watch this ticker now and today was a buy. Although down, the range was $3.56 to $3.97. I day trade some tickers and a .41 cent gain isn‚Äôt bad in a day but I got 30. It‚Äôs a good stock some days and wanted to share along with the story (I can‚Äôt post pics but y‚Äôall I hope can look that days price up) but know algos are behind big days if you watch the big gainers and the patterns. They may take a while but I had nothing but time. If the volume goes up especially be on the lookout. Either being shorted or options may have high volume for the day so definitely look before putting your high limit trade in. There are a lot of factors that could affect the day as well.",Only_Regret_2221,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/11yg1g6/noob_question_about_marketlimit_orders/jd9t4ss/,0.033,0.848,0.119,0.9783
