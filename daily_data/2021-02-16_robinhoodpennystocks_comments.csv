590,DD," There is no answer to this question. This is stockmaket and you have to learn for yourself what is best for you. But here are some tips:

-Try to use some strategy and hold onto it because WORST STUFF is PANIC STUFF

-no emotions in trading. If you feel depressed or anxious or anything like that cope with those feelings. Of course you can be pissed about not making moves or move to early but all in all it is best to controle emotions as good as possible

-all time rule nr 1 and you obviously did it there: don‘t trade what you can‘t afford. So starting low is good. 

-trading does take some time to learn to get into it but what I have experienced i that when you buy sth from what you think is cool and you like and you made DD on it it will eventually bounce back up. Don‘t think you can make 100% jumps every day. Of course ppl can do that and there are good traders on mass out there but for the average dude a steady climb up is realistic. 

So for this special occasion would be my tip to you: stay to your desicions, keep that stuff if you have no too hard feelings about it. Just take the loss when it is rather obvious that stuff is gonna crash (like The gamestop thing - there I for myself took a minor loss but a loss still)
