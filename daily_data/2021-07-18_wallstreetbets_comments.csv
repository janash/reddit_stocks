200,RH," Yeah options plays are for sure a large part of retail losses. And we can see one of the biggest revenue source of RH is options commissions. About retail bagholding, a lot of retail don't sell at a loss, and retail is fanatic with their buys. We see a lot of complaining from carrying bags but we don't see ""loss porn"" from selling stocks.

But bagholding means also ""diamond hands"" and as you say that might impact positively stock price. Besides, bagholding can lead to average down/buying the dip with new pay checks 😂

What I mean with retail can get/mantain the stock price up, I was refering to MM's and short sellers bringing the price down, so even with diamond hands those forces are in play, and witouth true fundamental catalysts the retail impact in stock price eventually fades...

""The stock market is a voting machine in the short term, and a weighing machine in the long term.""
Damn, this is some proverbial statement, it's so true more people should be aware of this 👌👌😂😂😂😂

It still amazes me how so many people here talk about stock price and not about market caps... 🤷🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️😂

In so many stocks we see the typical comment:
""if the other company stock is worth 100 this one will for sure be more than that""... Hilarious!

But in the end I beleive all of this is positive, a lot of retail will not leave the markets even when a correction/crash happens again, there's so much available info nowadays and it's so easy and cheap to trade and invest that I don't beleive this is just ""a trend"".",Chasing_Billions,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ombtyz/the_state_of_the_nonmemes_a_ta_of_all_your/h5nn7ma/,0.028,0.79,0.183,0.993

246,GDP, For sure.  You just referenced that USG isn’t getting free money and they have to pay it back.

248,ON," QE is neither inflationary nor deflationary. For something to be inflationary, it has to affect consumers' pockets (think stimulus checks, oil cartel supply chokehold, supply chain bottlenecks etc..). QE affects the asset composition of the  investor that sells their bonds to the central bank. This firm has to adjust their holdings to that the cash in place for the bonds is deployed somewhere. It's extremely unlikely that this cash sees the consumer, since it has to have been at asset manager in first place. 

There is an argument that since QE pushes asset prices up, investors (thus somer consumers) feel richer and spend more, which is called the wealth effect. But this isn't manifested in any meaningful way.

M2 hasn't been in a downward trend, it's been in an upward trend. This is because every QE dollar creates one dollar of base money and one dollar of broad money. The base money dollar is a technicality since banks have to hold base money and give non-banks broad money. 

It's actually becoming an annoyance for banks since they have too many deposits and lending is slowing dramatically. A couple of regs are in place constrain how much money a bank can hold so more QE is mostly just a bottleneck for money, which just gets dumped into ON RRP.",MinhNguyenPFL,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ombo3v/what_quantitative_easing_actually_is_for_retards/h5n8f2c/,0.036,0.897,0.067,0.5994
249,ON," I think you're still confused about the functions of each of these institutions. The Treasury finances and manages government spending by taxing, borrowing and spending. They don't care what the Fed do.

The Fed manages inflation and aggregate demand. They do so by supplying money and optimising bank lending/broad money so that inflation is at the target. QE is meant to help them achieve this goal by providing aggregate demand support, not to ""counteract"" Treasury borrowing.

Both Treasury issuance and QE increase ""money"". Treasury borrowing is net 0 money + the moneyness of new Treasury bonds which can be used as collateral. QE is net + 2 money since each dollar of QE has to produce 1 dollar of base money + 1 dollar of broad money.

The only ""counteracting"" thing going on are QE and ON RRP, but that's a separate matter.",MinhNguyenPFL,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ombo3v/what_quantitative_easing_actually_is_for_retards/h5nd60o/,0.042,0.849,0.109,0.6582
250,API," Hey guys,  
  
It's u/nobjos back again with this week's post. I post a similar list every week.  
  
Some FAQ’s:  
  
How does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about the stock is positive or negative).  
  
Can I use the code/is it open source: Yes.  
  
What is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here is the average across all the comments.

253,ALL," I'm going to give me opinion regarding /u/TonyMontanaIsNice.

1) The fact that he actually cites his shit means that it's automatically better than 95% of the DD out there. Just automatically. 

2) He seems to actually have some grasp of the more arcane parts of the market, and is willing to explain it to others. 

3) No market manipulation was done, unless the information cited was deliberately fabricated, or he willfully misrepresented what it meant.

4) /u/bonejohnson8 his behavior might not have been kosher when he was re-invited, but he was summarily ejected in the manner of a prisoner in front of a firing squad for (admittedly) using some less than stellar acronyms... Even though the underlying information was relevant. You, also, didn't exactly apologize for said summary execution of his posting privileges here. /u/OSRSkarma I know you apologized, then were rebuffed by him. Perhaps this might change your mind regarding the matter.

5) /u/FannyPackPhantom is right in that the behavior exhibited here is childish. Adult behavior is warranted, no expected, because you are ALL (unless your guardian permitted you to trade stocks in a custodial account) adults. If you insist on arguing otherwise by arguing against the factual points displayed here, perhaps /u/FannyPackPhantom should give you the ""Trades in a custodial account"" tag so we know who the minors are here. 

6) I don't give a FUCK whether GME, AMC, BB, Wish, etcetera is mentioned here so long as the fundamental thesis underlying your argument is sound, well researched (and cited), and you show you know how to execute the position. I likely won't invest in these companies because I can trade stocks on American listed exchanges, Over the counter foreign stocks, penny stocks, options, futures, bonds (including distressed debt), and currency. I can go long, or sell short. I am a captain in the ocean that is the markets, and I don't need to confine myself to oft repeated names. In that same vein, no one is putting a gun to any of your heads, and telling you you have to invest in these tickers. This place is reserved for **quality** and not **exclusion of tickers.**

7) It's people's duty to make, and not lose money in the markets, and the markets are not a team game. With that said, the markets are large enough and filled to the brim with opportunity. You do not need to 1) break the law, 2) break your moral compass, or 3) go outside the bounds of moral decency to get rich or make a buck. The saying here, and in the real world is to ""get rich or die trying."" What it SHOULDN'T allow you to do is, ""get rich by putting people's heads underwater."" However, most likely, none of you are Bobby Axelrod. You wouldn't have shorted airlines in the moments after the first tower were hit, and then doubled down after the second tower was hit with all your friends inside. Controlled Greed is good. It allows you to be disciplined in your approach to making money. Uncontrolled, unbridled, greed is fucking stupid. Take a look at martin shkrehli, or Jordan Belfort. You want to play in the game? Good. You want to STAY in the game, don't fucking cock it up by being shortsighted with ""get rich or die trying.""

278,ZM," I'd be shorting some stocks that are overvalued in their sector, are liquid, and are not easily pumped. Zoom comes to mind as it's trading at a 125 price to earnings multiple, and has strong competition from competitors like Microsoft Teams which is being bundled with every computer (and which Zoom is complaining about). 

As it's a growth stock, the last three months have been positive at around 10% as interest rates have kept receding on the 10 YR T notes. Interest rates will rise again, leading to a sector rotation back to cyclicals and value stocks more generally sooner or later.

Short interest as a percentage of float is less than 5% which means the borrow fee should be very, very, small. 

Universities are going back to in person instruction, and so ZM is not going to be able to keep its growth, and will likely stall out short to mid term over there, especially as vaccines bring businesses back to in person. 

I just don't think its valuation is justified, and any crash would hit that stock harder than most.

All I’m saying is I can tell the dude does his research and shares his speculations with us.

If you're wondering what that is. I tabulated all the LT debt that ViacomCBS has to see if it could service the debt easily.

He assumed the roles of chairman of the board and chief executive officer, gained ownership of approximately 71 percent of the company, and renamed it XPO Logistics. Jacobs listed the company on the New York Stock Exchange, retaining the ticker symbol (NYSE:XPO).

In February 2012, Jacobs announced plans to grow XPO's revenue from $175 million to $5 billion within five years through M&A. By the end of 2016, he had turned XPO into a $15 billion global company. XPO reported revenue of $16.3 billion in 2020.
