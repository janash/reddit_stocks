0,AMC, The premarket is looking nice today. This is why I like GameStop better than AMC. Less shares higher short interest and the executives seem to be easing into raising capital a little bit at a time and not selling shares every other week unlike AMC.

4,GME," My one bearish statement against GME is it's toxic management culture. I'm sanguine about it because of the changes at the top, but the platitude that ""people are policy"" is true and it's not all the mid-level management got tossed out with the old execs even though they probably should have.  

The turnaround that GME has had is extraordinary and shows the power of the retail investor, but I'm hoping GME invests in their most important asset: their employees.

7,GME," I feel like people are retconning GameStop because they want to think it’s some cherished facet of the retail world. If people liked GameStop the company as much as they like GME the stock, they’d be fine.

GameStop the company was known for screwing up orders, misleadingly labeling games as “new”, shipping the wrong stuff, giving you barely any money for trade-in, and their attempt at retro gaming was a disaster.

I don’t have a bear case for the company from a financial standpoint, I just think it’s funny how suddenly it’s some beloved icon of the gaming world when for the past 6 years it’s been the butt of jokes and largely despised by gamers.

How are they transforming into a tech company? What does that even mean? They’re just going to lower overhead by closing stores, moving to more of an online model, and I’ve heard talk of them starting gaming leagues, increasing loyalty/rewards programs with that, etc. How does that make them a tech company?

Worldwide brand awareness? Yeah, maybe because of GME. GameStop itself has very little international presence. Who is the loyal fan base? I’ve never met anyone that genuinely loves GameStop that was over the age of like 18.

I’m sure I’ll get hate for this but I just don’t see what’s really positioning them for growth. PC and console gaming is fairly dead right now, constrained by supply issues. They’re going to lose the higher-margin knick knack sales they had in-store since games aren’t that profitable. Technology is moving toward streaming/downloaded media instead of physical media, which cuts into their used games sales.

Edit: yep, here are the downvotes. By all means, tell me again about these mythical people that love GameStop. Or just don’t ask for bear cases if you can’t handle the truth.",notherday11,95,/r/stocks/comments/o5m9is/gamestop_completes_atthemarket_equity_offering/h2nbaud/,0.077,0.779,0.144,0.9474

Publishers and developers have their own platforms, in way more visible places than Gamestop.

12,GME," This post was posted less than 45 minutes ago and there are already 130 comments on it, lol. Brigading much?

I will tell you this; yeah, GME could be a turnaround story to come.

BUT: at $14 billion market cap and $5 billion SALES as at the last full fiscal year (ended Jan 31, 2021), **it's already priced as if the turnaround is complete**. With sales dropping off the cliff for the past several years and no profits during the same, GME is NOT a solid long-term investment, but a speculative bet. So position yourselves accordingly, instead of feeding each other copium.

And it's hilarious that you guys turned away from the short squeeze narrative and transitioned into the value-investing narrative, when metrics are actually less supportive of the latter. At least with the short squeeze narrative, few knew what the fuck was going on because of our God-awful record-keeping system for stock lending and related activities. But then, maybe it's good that at least there's less of you apes seriously claiming that each GME stock will go up to $1m (yeah, I've seen that).

All in all, you guys are probably in for a disappointing few years down the line.

54,GME," I really want to approach my investment choices rationally and I think I do with regards to GME. But it is always healthy to get opposing views. I don’t ‘fanboy’ because of 5 silly internet point but because I like the stock. 

But consider the hiring of skilled former-Amazon leaders, a billion dollars and worldwide attention. It all comes down to wether or not you think that has potential for a company.

So it’s fair enough if you don’t do. But saying that ‘tHeRe’S nO pLaN!!’ is simply ignorant. Yes the shares got diluted but it’s a trade off as the company needs cash to transform itself. Some people think they can transform themselves and others don’t. Which is fair.

59,GME," Cohen bought into a company that at the time was valued some 500 millions, which gave it significant assets for its market cap. Now the cap is up 30x on pure craziness, and the assets it controls and future prospects don’t justify it.

GME at this point in time makes sense only as a speculation, hoping to sell to a greater fool.

Pretending it has a value as a business is nonsensical and, most likely, dishonest. It’s just an attempt to pump it for speculative reasons.

65,FB," I’ve been investing and trading since 2007. The biggest thing I’ve learned is to buy or sell the hype/news and not wait for the actual event. Example, the news about a merger happening and not waiting for the actual merger. My best early trade was Sirius XM and I waited for the merger but the news of the approved merger was when I should’ve sold and I thought I had a great profit but it will be even better when they get operating. Wrong! But my research was correct about that trade in the first place. Learned and moved forward. Next. Resist the temptation to trade!! This is really hard. I could’ve bought Goog, Netflix, FB, Apple and held all of that time and made tons more than what I did as a trader. Maybe separate the two and open two accounts. The “I never sell account” and the “trader account.” Buy dividend stocks or change the game companies in the I never sell account and reinvest the dividends into more stock and wait for stock splits. I’ve tried to have them both in the same account but when you stare at it everyday and some news about something big comes, I cut myself off at the knees and didn’t see it thru because I wanted to reallocate those dollars. Next, Don’t be afraid to cut your losses and move on from a stock. Also, don’t be afraid to take small profits all along the way. A win is a win!

73,GDP," I have a bit of experience...  I started in vesting in mutual funds in 1985 and stocks directly in 1987 -- I made investing my profession in 1994.  

If you are investing for the next 40 or 50 years my first suggestion would be to look outside the US.  If you look at GDP per capita it will be much easier to double in India than in the US.  Take a look at demographics.  If you look at a chart that shows the number of people in each age group you will see that China is very challenged for many years to come.  Most of the European countries have lousy demographics too.  Again, India is well placed as are many Asian and African countries.

&#x200B;

If you look at ""form of government"" you will find there are lots of issues with communism/socialism -- these aren't good places to invest.  The government is too well placed to take your money.

&#x200B;

It is fine to put some of the money into US stocks.  I would rather buy into a small cap fund that allows for companies that succeed to stay in the fund longer (not an ETF).  I would then buy a set of Emerging market mutual funds -- stick to buying the best countries and not broad funds that are just full of China (you want the places that will be growing for decades).

84,DD," I'm a regular over at /r/superstonk so my answer is going to be pretty obvious, but I'm 25 and here are my thoughts. Currently you're young enough that you can lose a decent bit of that cash and it won't negatively affect your life too much. You don't have a mortgage or kids and although if you did lose some money you'd be missing out on opportunities, your risk tolerance should be as high as it's ever going to be. With that said I'm 100% not recommending you YOLO into ANYTHING. As a new investor you shouldn't be playing with anything more than 20% of what you've got. 

Currently the markets seem to be on a bit of a knife's edge. I wouldn't want to be storing all my money on anything (even 'safe' stocks or the SPY). 

My honest recommendation is to put 5k on GME as lotto tickets (although IMO the DD checks out and it's more of an inevitability than a lotto ticket - please read into anything before putting your money there), and then I'd invest an additional 5k in something to learn the markets and get some growth going in a case where the entire US financial system doesn't collapse within the next 6 months. 

My personal hedge for the latter scenario is in steel. We're in a commodity super cycle and steel stocks are all massively undervalued (CLF, MT, STLD, VALE - you name it). If you're interested in learning more, check out /r/Vitards. Plenty of info there.

Currently you're young enough that you can lose a decent bit of that cash and it won't negatively affect your life too much. You don't have a mortgage or kids and although if you did lose some money you'd be missing out on opportunities, your risk tolerance should be as high as it's ever going to be. With that said I'm 100% not recommending you YOLO into ANYTHING. As a new investor you shouldn't be playing with anything more than 20% of what you've got. 

Currently the markets seem to be on a bit of a knife's edge. I wouldn't want to be storing all my money on anything (even 'safe' stocks or the SPY). 

My honest recommendation is to put 5k on GME as lotto tickets (although IMO the DD checks out and it's more of an inevitability than a lotto ticket - please read into anything before putting your money there), and then I'd invest an additional 5k in something to learn the markets and get some growth going in a case where the entire US financial system doesn't collapse within the next 6 months. 

My personal hedge for the latter scenario is in steel. We're in a commodity super cycle and steel stocks are all massively undervalued (CLF, MT, STLD, VALE - you name it). If you're interested in learning more, check out /r/Vitards. Plenty of info there.

91,SPGI," 100% SPGI, probably. Starting that young, there would be no reason to try to accelerate my gains beyond that. 50k 10 years ago when I graduated college would be 0.5M by now. If it continues to perform as it has, by retirement it would be 25M at age 62. Even accounting for inflation, that's a hair over 7M in 2011 dollars, meaning you'd have a 140x multiplier in terms of purchasing power by plunking it in that one thing and not touching it until you're done working. 

That's with literally no further contributions to it beyond the 50k.",Overthinks_Questions,1,/r/stocks/comments/o56dpz/if_you_could_go_back_to_being_a_22yr_old_college/h2lwt50/,0.045,0.931,0.024,-0.25
92,AAPL," I mean, when I was 22 (2002) I bought 100 shares of AAPL for $14/shares (this might have been 2003, but it was either 2002 or 2003).  I sold about a year later when I'd basically doubled my money. If I'd held those without selling anything, today I would have 5,600 shares worth about $739,000 at today's closing price.

So, the easy answer is that I would tell my 22 year old self, spend the $50,000 on AAPL, get 3,571 shares with that money circa 2002 and don't sell. Then my current 41 year old self would have 199,975 shares just from the splits (I.e. not including any reinvested dividends) worth approximately $26.4 Million at today's closing price. And I could retire.

So, that is an easy answer for me.

If we're not playing the ""back to the future"" game, I would tell myself to ""be boring"" and invest that $50,000 in some low cost funds/ETFs at about 70% VTI/30% VXUS (or equivalent), set them to reinvest dividends and pretend like you don't know that money even exists.

115,AMZN," I picked up a book at the thrift store to prepare certified financial advisors. It's called analysis of derivatives for the CFA program. Based on what I've read so far, they would look at risk and what is known about the stock at the time. I don't think they look at emerging trends, but compare current data on stocks.  Meaning, at the time AMZN was $200, I think the PE ratio was insane. You had to know more than just what an analysis comparing Amazon to Walmart would show you, and once you factor in risk, most CFA's would steer you away-I bet.

But they should be able to get you steady, safe returns in a steady market.

221,CHPT," I hold it, imo you have to know why you are in it. They have a practical monopoly on L2 charging which is different from the L3 charging that Tesla talk so much about. L3 charging is more expensive but you can charge to 90% in 40 mins. CHPT L2 is like a traditional charger where it will take you a couple of hours but it is way cheaper and they sell home chargers too. Whether you invest in a L3 Charger or L2 Charger company depends on where you see the future of charging EVs lie in. If you buy CHPT you basically believe people will on charge their cars at home or at work or when shopping. Basically you will never take a pitstop like how you top up gas right now. It happens when you are at a place for a long time.

&#x200B;

It could be a good swing play as well if you think that the infrastructure bill will lead to the government investing in L2 Chargers over L3 (which I believe they will).",SirPalat,5,/r/stocks/comments/o5iyhf/rstocks_daily_discussion_technicals_tuesday_jun/h2o75pa/,0.0,0.899,0.101,0.9538

226,FCF," A quick glance says it's a pretty good company all around.  Steady revenue, profit, and free cash flow growth over the years.  Assets exceed liabilities.  In an industry that undoubtedly has a future.

Price to free cash flow is actually pretty good... about 14 times.  I usually like to buy for less than 20.  Check mark there.

PE ratio, however, is much too high.  It's currently at 35.  I would prefer something at 15-20.  Debt to EBIDTA is also just over 3, which is my normal upper bound.  It's not a huge amount over 3, so maybe forgivable, but I'd like to see them paying that down, especially with potential rate hikes coming.  I didn't have time to check if that's been the case.

I'm not exactly sure how PE can be so high but P/FCF can be so decent.  I would look into that if I were you.  A rudimentary look at the chart tells me we're currently at ATHs, too.  So I like this company, but probably not at this price.  Me personally this is the kind of company I'd have on my watch list and be ready to snap up as soon as we have a significant pullback.  That's part of a wider strategy on my end, though, because the cheaper you buy something the higher your overall return.

275,ATH," Yeah that's a bad idea. The reason stocks are up so much is because people are moving money from the bond market into the stock market to make money. The bond market is way bigger than the stock market. 2020 and 2021 have become a self fulfilling prophesy because money goes into stocks, stocks go up, people make money and invest it in the market again, it goes up, and the whole thing repeats. The issue is that eventually we will have to combat inflation with increased interest rates. People are so on edge that they hang on every single thing Jpow says. If the market was actually robust, we wouldn't be paying as much attention to Jpow as we are. It wouldn't surprise me if we're at a new ATH and we see a gradual decline in the coming years.

2. Going into peak sales season of summer/fall. Swim vacation summer, back to school.
3. Aerie has been a runaway hit for them, growing to close to a 10% share of the women's underwear and lingerie market, all this while Victoria's Secret continues to lose share at a precipitous pace, down from 32% to 21% in the last five years. Aerie has grown sales in Q1 2021 89% yoy, online sales grew 160% yoy, and operating margin grew to 26%, meaning that they are at an inflection point to take full advantage of operating leverage and convert incremental sales to profits.
4. I see continued momentum into Aerie, and in a best case scenario, **I could see them PASSING VICTORIA'S SECRET in market share in five years,** especially as malls continue to die, and especially if they continue to build upon synergies in their growing ath-leisure, lounge and swimware lines. Aerie's OFFL/NE label, as a lower cost ath-leisure alternative to Lululemon, has been picking up a whole lot of steam among Tik Tok influencers. I see bike shorts coming back in a big way for the first time in 30 years, as a high cut alternative to yoga pants in the heat of the summer.
5. Huge things happen to returns when you pass a respected market leader in a slow moving industry. DPZ (Dominos Pizza) returned gains to investors outpacing Amazon over the past ten years, as they slowly overtook Pizza Hut in market share for the first time. These things don't happen often, but when they do, cash in. Aerie has an outside chance to pull it off......... Assume Victoria's secret doesn't grow (as it hasn't been) and revenue is stuck around 7B/year. Aerie is at 1B in revenue, growing >50% per year. At 50% growth rates per year, they will do it in 5 years. Assuming a steady rate of growth rate decay, slowing to 18% per year in 5-7 years, they'll do it in 7 years.
6. I see the Jeans segment, though stagnant for years, to pick up in the next year for their flagship American Eagle brand, because jeans are undergoing their first supercycle change in 20 years, as skinnies head out the door and relaxed/mom styles, high waists, boyfriends, wides, flares and skater/JNCO cuts all compete for dominance of Gen Z/Alpha. AE is smartly positioned in all of these categories. Expect their AE line to grow in line with other jeans comparables like Levi Strauss.

5. Huge things happen to returns when you pass a respected market leader in a slow moving industry. DPZ (Dominos Pizza) returned gains to investors outpacing Amazon over the past ten years, as they slowly overtook Pizza Hut in market share for the first time. These things don't happen often, but when they do, cash in. Aerie has an outside chance to pull it off......... Assume Victoria's secret doesn't grow (as it hasn't been) and revenue is stuck around 7B/year. Aerie is at 1B in revenue, growing >50% per year. At 50% growth rates per year, they will do it in 5 years. Assuming a steady rate of growth rate decay, slowing to 18% per year in 5-7 years, they'll do it in 7 years.
6. I see the Jeans segment, though stagnant for years, to pick up in the next year for their flagship American Eagle brand, because jeans are undergoing their first supercycle change in 20 years, as skinnies head out the door and relaxed/mom styles, high waists, boyfriends, wides, flares and skater/JNCO cuts all compete for dominance of Gen Z/Alpha. AE is smartly positioned in all of these categories. Expect their AE line to grow in line with other jeans comparables like Levi Strauss.

3. Aerie has been a runaway hit for them, growing to close to a 10% share of the women's underwear and lingerie market, all this while Victoria's Secret continues to lose share at a precipitous pace, down from 32% to 21% in the last five years. Aerie has grown sales in Q1 2021 89% yoy, online sales grew 160% yoy, and operating margin grew to 26%, meaning that they are at an inflection point to take full advantage of operating leverage and convert incremental sales to profits.
4.

319,IR," They are not stupid. They can see inflation but they are seeing it as transitory. Which tbh the CPI data backs up. After every recession things like Used Cars and Lumber spike in price because poorer people who lost their jobs, find new jobs and need to get a car to travel this demand for used car goes up. Similar for lumber in the construction industry (except add the inelastic supply). 

Personally I won't be too worried about inflation, it will reach 3.5% at the end of the year and next year it will got back to 2% a year and then IR will increase subsequently. There are good arguments for why inflation is not transitory. But most arguments about inflation being long lasting is fear mongering and they don't know what they are talking about or they are seeing the policies in vacuum.

321,MMT," MMT works if you use all the tools in the tool box...

The way to beat this is by taxing the excess cash out of the system but there is absolutely no appetite for that and the Dems don't control the senate.

If you can only use rates to fight the battle MMT is useless.

And you're right, they're not stupid which is why if inflation was anything but transitory they wouldn't say anything because it would plunge us back into recession.",Copper2021,1,/r/stocks/comments/o58wr7/what_do_you_guys_think_is_going_to_happen_in_the/h2nr68c/,0.18,0.783,0.038,-0.9297

345,IRS," It’s all the same. Call premium is taxed at current ordinary income rates. 

Added issue is that selling a short dated sub 30DTE or deep in the money, the IRS views that as an effective sale date.

346,IRS," No, if you already qualified for LTCG, then you never lose that status on the underlying.

But if it’s short term held, and you sold either at sub 30DTE or ITM (deep or not), then the call sale date is the date they use as a record of sale if you get assigned. Even if the assignment comes when the underlying should have qualified for LTCG.

Basically it’s to prevent people who held a security for 11 months, sell a in the money (thus capturing premium benefit for selling it based on market conditions today) and then when it gets assigned a month later they qualify for the LTCG tax rate.

IRS won’t allow that. They will stop the holding period on the date the call is sold if it gets assigned in the future.",Pdicky69,0,/r/stocks/comments/o5oqev/is_selling_covered_calls_a_way_to_avoid_taxes/h2owytx/,0.031,0.882,0.087,0.7801

379,MSCI," I personally invest 10% in one of my home country’s ETFs( I am guessing in your case that’s the US), in my case the DAX
Then I have 10% in some kind of physical Asset (Gold, real estate etc.)
I put 60% in to a MSCI World ETF  (I personally like physical ETFs but that’s up to you)
The MSCI World consists of 1600 Companies, from which 67% representation are US Stocks.
To not overweigh the US representation in my portfolio I put the remaining 20% into an Emerging Markets ETF in which there are no US Stocks!
So all in all I have a very diversified Long term portfolio with pretty good return.
Also be sure to not just dump in your 100k in one go, but rather slowly invest over the time span of a few months, to make usage of the cost average effect!
I personally am a big fan of ETFs and I really recommend you reading into the topic. It’s a great long term investment.

386,GDP," In economics, a recession is a business cycle contraction when there is a general decline in economic activity.[1][2] Recessions generally occur when there is a widespread drop in spending (an adverse demand shock). This may be triggered by various events, such as a financial crisis, an external trade shock, an adverse supply shock, the bursting of an economic bubble, or a large-scale anthropogenic or natural disaster (e.g. a pandemic). In the United States, it is defined as ""a significant decline in economic activity spread across the market, lasting more than a few months, normally visible in real GDP, real income, employment, industrial production, and wholesale-retail sales"".[3] In the United Kingdom, it is defined as a negative economic growth for two consecutive quarters.[4][5]

Governments usually respond to recessions by adopting expansionary macroeconomic policies, such as increasing money supply or increasing government spending and decreasing taxation.

Put simply, a recession is the decline of economic activity, which means that the public has stopped buying products for a while which can cause the downfall of GDP after a period of economic expansion (a time where products become popular and the income profit of a business becomes large). This causes inflation (the rise of product prices). In a recession, the rate of inflation slows down, stops, or becomes negative.

387,ATH," When you sold your shares you had a REALIZED loss of $1,000 which you could write off on your taxes for 2021. When you re-bought into the position, this moved from a realized loss back to an UNREALIZED loss and the total was added to your new cost basis. Whenever you close your position, any loss at that time will move back to being a REALIZED loss.

I’ve done this before where I rebought a much smaller number of shares and my new cost basis actually ended up higher than the stock’s ATH at that time.",njo2002,1,/r/stocks/comments/o5sokl/wash_sale_does_the_number_of_shares_i_buy_back/h2oebii/,0.115,0.828,0.057,-0.7003
