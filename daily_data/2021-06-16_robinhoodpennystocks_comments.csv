3,DD," You're either looking for a fight or your DD is terrible. Cash on hand for years and multiple groundbreaking therapies with very good results in phases 2 and soon 3 (not including covid moonshot). I'm not tempting you, I'd rather you go away tbh. Investing is risky and people like you don't help. I'm shining light on your half assed DD and obvious bias. 

Good luck with whatever you think is a good stock! 

You can Google just as easy as I can ;)

11,CLVS," It‚Äôs undervalued, heavily shorted, they are a potential buyout candidate, and their flagship drug actually works to treat ovarian and prostate cancer. They also have more cancer treatment drugs in the pipeline in phase II trials that should be released in Q3. 

$12 a share is a little on the high end for the value of the company but as I said earlier, this stock was trading at $100 in Aug 2017 when their flagship drug was approved by the FDA.

So let‚Äôs say CLVS continues to be shorted. Buyout rumors start to swirl, their second drug gets FDA approved, shorts start failing to cover, what do you think that would do to the stock price? Or any combination of those scenarios?? That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm bullish.",Woody56usmc,-1,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/o0tyio/20k_yolo_into_clvs/h1z88ub/,0.072,0.813,0.115,0.466

I sold off AMC at 68. But had regret and bouught 4 back at 50.  Today I sold those 4 shares and have a few bucks to spare.
