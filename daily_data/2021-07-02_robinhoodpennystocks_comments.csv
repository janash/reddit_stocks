0,PT," Only two prices matter in investments – the price you buy and the price you sell. If the fundamentals haven't changed, and they haven't in the case of $CTXR, then keep holding until it hits your PT.

7,RH," Yeah I just read through and compared to Krispy Kreme and Chewy S1 both of them had a lock up period of around 6 months. This Robinthehood one literally says on page 261 of the filing that the directors and the chief financial officer, are allowed to dump up to 5% (if i understand this correctly) but either way its very sus that they have this.

If someone knows of an S1 that has exemptions like this for the directors please tell me so I can read through it.

11,AGTC," AGTC seems to have only good news and a bright future. 

- Institutional ownership is around 56% last I checked. So, there must be confidence in the company by actual think tanks. 

- It's possible that it's currently being shorted to keep the price around $4, making it a great buying opportunity if you're willing to await the glow-up.

- YTD figures show that AGTC hasn't already had a glow-up this year, other than a decent spike in February that didn't even meet the lowest analyst PT. 

- AGTC had a stock offering earlier this year that generated enough money to carry them into (I believe) 2023. So, it might be unlikely that they'll have another stock offering for a while. That's a positive in my outlook.

AND when they did the stock offering, it didn't really affect the stock price. Another positive, to me. 

It was also priced at $5, which is higher than it's currently trading.

- The only ""bad"" news is that the CSO left in June 2021. But I didn't take it as bad news, because he was basically scalped by Crispr after years on the job at AGTC. His work history showed that he had stayed at AGTC about the same time as usual before making a career move. 7 years, I believe. So my read is that he must have been doing a great job at AGTC to be scalped. He seems to be a CSO who likes ground-up organizing duties, judging from his work history. AGTC is up & running on R&D pipeline. 

- AGTC is also investing in building out a facility for manufacturing and expansion. 

- There was an article yesterday that was talking about how AGTC was one of the few places that figured out how to keep research going during the COVID-19 shutdowns in 2020. That speaks to good leadership to me. 

- On the social media front, it hasn't gotten a while lotta of traction recently. In Q1, The infamous Trey Trades was making a lot of videos about it before he blew up on the AMC craze. He's a supporter of the company, does NOT see this as a meme stock, but supports the actual company as a solid biotech that's doing good R&D with strong fundamentals. He also has eye issues that he's hoping their research can help. 

If/When this thing pops, it'll likely go up fast. There's very little volume moving lately and very little volume available if buyers rush in.

For the record, I've been holding and swinging at the same time. Currently at 55,000 shares. First got in at $4 weeks before the supposed ""pump & dump"" earlier this year. So far, I've sold around 80k shares on swings and built up a pretty good ""free"" position in my holdings.",jtl_jax,15,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/oc4iln/agtc_thoughts/h3skkpj/,0.024,0.839,0.136,0.9945

24,ABBV," Disclaimer: I own ITRM.

I'm not trying to pump $ITRM but just in 2021 there have been 8 CRLs issued. In 2020 there have been 33 CRLs issued. Taking 4 CRLs as a clear definitive answer isn't exactly statistically significant. Below are the stocks with CRLs issued.

I agree the letter for $ITRM is worrying but what we do not know is what is the deficiency. If it is a CMC fault, approval is definitely still on the table. If it is a requirement for more data, then that is an additional trial and that is bad news in the short term (and long term if things go bad). FDA approvals are very heavy on statistics and the confidence intervals for $ITRM looks good from P3 data. The concern is that we don't know how trustworthy their methodology is(and if there is I am not qualified to analyse it). 

That said, until greater clarity comes regard to the deficiency, anyone who says ITRM is going to the moon or it's going to die are just false prophets. 

&#x200B;

IF anything, I would look at $PRVB (I don't own it). PRVB had a letter similarly worded as well and had its PDUFA pushed back by 3 months with results out today. Maybe that would be more telling.

27,ALNY," Disclaimer: I own ITRM.

I'm not trying to pump $ITRM but just in 2021 there have been 8 CRLs issued. In 2020 there have been 33 CRLs issued. Taking 4 CRLs as a clear definitive answer isn't exactly statistically significant. Below are the stocks with CRLs issued.

I agree the letter for $ITRM is worrying but what we do not know is what is the deficiency. If it is a CMC fault, approval is definitely still on the table. If it is a requirement for more data, then that is an additional trial and that is bad news in the short term (and long term if things go bad). FDA approvals are very heavy on statistics and the confidence intervals for $ITRM looks good from P3 data. The concern is that we don't know how trustworthy their methodology is(and if there is I am not qualified to analyse it). 

That said, until greater clarity comes regard to the deficiency, anyone who says ITRM is going to the moon or it's going to die are just false prophets. 

&#x200B;

IF anything, I would look at $PRVB (I don't own it). PRVB had a letter similarly worded as well and had its PDUFA pushed back by 3 months with results out today. Maybe that would be more telling.

IF anything, I would look at $PRVB (I don't own it). PRVB had a letter similarly worded as well and had its PDUFA pushed back by 3 months with results out today. Maybe that would be more telling.

34,CRMD," Disclaimer: I own ITRM.

I'm not trying to pump $ITRM but just in 2021 there have been 8 CRLs issued. In 2020 there have been 33 CRLs issued. Taking 4 CRLs as a clear definitive answer isn't exactly statistically significant. Below are the stocks with CRLs issued.

I agree the letter for $ITRM is worrying but what we do not know is what is the deficiency. If it is a CMC fault, approval is definitely still on the table. If it is a requirement for more data, then that is an additional trial and that is bad news in the short term (and long term if things go bad). FDA approvals are very heavy on statistics and the confidence intervals for $ITRM looks good from P3 data. The concern is that we don't know how trustworthy their methodology is(and if there is I am not qualified to analyse it). 

That said, until greater clarity comes regard to the deficiency, anyone who says ITRM is going to the moon or it's going to die are just false prophets.

I agree the letter for $ITRM is worrying but what we do not know is what is the deficiency. If it is a CMC fault, approval is definitely still on the table. If it is a requirement for more data, then that is an additional trial and that is bad news in the short term (and long term if things go bad). FDA approvals are very heavy on statistics and the confidence intervals for $ITRM looks good from P3 data. The concern is that we don't know how trustworthy their methodology is(and if there is I am not qualified to analyse it). 

That said, until greater clarity comes regard to the deficiency, anyone who says ITRM is going to the moon or it's going to die are just false prophets. 

&#x200B;

IF anything, I would look at $PRVB (I don't own it). PRVB had a letter similarly worded as well and had its PDUFA pushed back by 3 months with results out today. Maybe that would be more telling.

47,MESO," Disclaimer: I own ITRM.

I'm not trying to pump $ITRM but just in 2021 there have been 8 CRLs issued. In 2020 there have been 33 CRLs issued. Taking 4 CRLs as a clear definitive answer isn't exactly statistically significant. Below are the stocks with CRLs issued.

I agree the letter for $ITRM is worrying but what we do not know is what is the deficiency. If it is a CMC fault, approval is definitely still on the table. If it is a requirement for more data, then that is an additional trial and that is bad news in the short term (and long term if things go bad). FDA approvals are very heavy on statistics and the confidence intervals for $ITRM looks good from P3 data. The concern is that we don't know how trustworthy their methodology is(and if there is I am not qualified to analyse it). 

That said, until greater clarity comes regard to the deficiency, anyone who says ITRM is going to the moon or it's going to die are just false prophets. 

&#x200B;

IF anything, I would look at $PRVB (I don't own it). PRVB had a letter similarly worded as well and had its PDUFA pushed back by 3 months with results out today. Maybe that would be more telling.

54,SCPH," Disclaimer: I own ITRM.

I'm not trying to pump $ITRM but just in 2021 there have been 8 CRLs issued. In 2020 there have been 33 CRLs issued. Taking 4 CRLs as a clear definitive answer isn't exactly statistically significant. Below are the stocks with CRLs issued.

I agree the letter for $ITRM is worrying but what we do not know is what is the deficiency. If it is a CMC fault, approval is definitely still on the table. If it is a requirement for more data, then that is an additional trial and that is bad news in the short term (and long term if things go bad). FDA approvals are very heavy on statistics and the confidence intervals for $ITRM looks good from P3 data. The concern is that we don't know how trustworthy their methodology is(and if there is I am not qualified to analyse it). 

That said, until greater clarity comes regard to the deficiency, anyone who says ITRM is going to the moon or it's going to die are just false prophets. 

&#x200B;

IF anything, I would look at $PRVB (I don't own it). PRVB had a letter similarly worded as well and had its PDUFA pushed back by 3 months with results out today. Maybe that would be more telling.
