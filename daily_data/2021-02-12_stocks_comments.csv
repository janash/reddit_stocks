0,DD," This is some good DD, great read.

Two things to point out though, apologies if other commenters have brought this up. Quite relevant to potential licensees for QNX in the auto space:

> Apple [‚Ä¶] has its own OS [but] this still requires an entirely new system in order to work in the EV sector

Hell will freeze over before Apple licenses anyone else's OS for its own product. This flies in the face of what the company does, its entire ethos, and has been a common misconception for decades. Acquire another company for middleware or for integration into the main sw/hw lines? Sure. License another OS? Never. Apple will straight up *never* do business with BlackBerry. The biggest and only B2B deal would be key patent licensing, nothing more. 

> Also, Apple announced recently that they would be developing their own EV

Apple has announced *nothing* regarding a car. Zip, zero. No official announcement. Are they working in the space? Absolutely. But everything out there is from little birdies, that's it.

Combine the two, and you can count Apple right out of this equation. $0.02.",InvaderJ,116,/r/stocks/comments/li0rpg/blackberry_a_dormant_giant/gn0zvva/,0.044,0.9,0.057,0.3765

112,BB," Hmm... I guess the greatest threat would be a big player like Apple or Google creating a better RTOS than BB and then convincing everyone to drop BB and add them instead. This would take immense amount of time and resources, and there's no guarantee that companies would necessarily switch. Another threat: John Chen dies or does not continue his contract as CEO after 2023. He has a huge bonus for BB reaching a SP PT of 30 or more for 10+ days, so he's definitely not leaving before that happens. But will he continue to be CEO after 10 years working for BB? I have no idea. I'd guess only John Chen knows, and he himself might not know until he gets to see how BB plays out over these next few years. Hmmm what else. A lot of fears are remedied simply through this partnership with Amazon. You can think of them as a guarantor for a mortgage, where you are buying a house, but you've got Warren Buffet backing you up, guaranteeing that the mortgage will be paid for if you like die or something. That's a pretty strong guarantee for the broker / real estate agent that they're going to get their money. And we (the investors) are the broker / real estate agent in this metaphor.

This also depends on how you define 'threat'. If it's a threat to the company as a whole, I find it's really just the above arguments that are credible. If you define it as suppression to stock price, there's probably a lot of things, the biggest one being revenue streams until BB has IVY in full production. This hypothetically could suppress prices this year and next, although I don't think this is likely, nor do I think that BB will just have this form of revenue stream up their sleeves for these next two years.

119,BB," Thanks man! I really appreciate it. I have been spending a lot of time these last few months researching and reading.

Here's some bearish analysis from a different comment:

Copied from a different comment:

Here's my biggest bearish analysis. In retrospect, I should have included this as well, but it slipped my mind. For me, bearish analysis is really important--only a bad investor would not want to consider both sides of the argument. Anyways, here it is:

*Bearish possibilities*:

1) *Revenue*- As mentioned in the main post, revenue is a big issue for initial investors. YoY growth has been disappointing for investors, particularly when looking at BB, which has so many clients and software products--the natural response should really be: ""What gives?"". QNX has been sold so far through one-time fees to clients. This has the advantage of easily grabbing new customers, but the disadvantage in that one-time fees is a horrible revenue model for a company. It requires constant customer acquisition YoY, or other revenue streams to support the model. BB does have other subscription-based revenue streams in their other products, but still lags behind in revenue compared to expectations (there's never a 'surge' in growth for this reason). The counter-argument here is that this is actually BB's plan in the first place. BB's disappointing and rather monetarily uneventful last 7 years was mostly spending developing their software and certifying it, as well acquiring new customers and governments. This helped them build a huge advantage in this emerging market before the big players really caught in to what was happening. They began developing technology ages before anyone else thought to, and now little to no competitors in the EV embedded RTOS space. But couldn't they have at least sold QNX for more, or perhaps for a subscription model? Perhaps, and perhaps they regret not instituting a different revenue model. But nevertheless, here's an analogy: Book authors and writers often sell their first book that they write in a series for free, or for a very low price. This is pretty common now for emerging authors who are trying to get noticed, particularly for e-books and selling in the online space. The first book isn't the money-maker, its the second. The second book is sold at full-price, as will the third, fourth, and fifth books should there be that many in the series. Once you buy the first book (or get the first book for free), you are hooked. You have to buy the second book if you enjoyed the first one. This analogy might be the same business strategy of BB. QNX is not the main product, but just the hook. IVY will be the big money maker, both that companies will want to use and also feel forced to use. IVY will run on top of QNX and will save the automaker lots of money, and BB will also make money from the automaker from a subscription-based model, and also from subscription models from selling data to different enterprises, such as insurance companies, governments, and other large institutions. So the bearish argument is valid in that BB's current revenue streams are weak, but the bearish argument may not hold up under new revenue models which will pick up over time.

2) *Competitors*: BB has competitors in sectors such as cybersecruity and IoTs, but when it comes to the EV market, they have a huge moat. The bearish argument here is that BB is going to be crushed in all these sectors. So let's examine these possibilities. First off, BB has focused on security as their number one priority for their software products. This is the main reason why governments have readily adopted their software products into their products and military, including high-risk security products such as jets, rockets, and other computer-based technology. They are picked because they are the most secure. IoTs vary, and often times do not need the greatest amount of security. This sector will most likely be the one that experiences the most competition. Now for the EV market. Who is BB's biggest competitor in the EV RTOS market? Tesla? Apple? Google? VxWorks? Someone else? Tesla is building their own software based on Linux. They are having a lot of trouble certifying their software. A lot of trouble. This is important when it comes to autonomous EVs. Autonomous EVs will not be allowed on the road until they have the right certifications when it comes to security. QNX is the most certified and the most secure product out there by a mile. Tesla may achieve what they are looking for over time, but so far they have not gotten there. This is concerning for anyone looking for an alternative, but even more than this, Tesla is an auto maker, which means that other car companies are not going to use their OS product since Tesla is their competitor. This can immediate root out other auto makers from beings competitive threats as well. That leaves Apple and Google. Apple has not announced any such project, but they do have great software when it comes to security. However, they would still have to nearly build this product from the ground up, and this would take a lot of time and resources. Considering they were recently looking to teaming up with Hyundai to do this, it is probably safe to assume that they are way behind on this front. They will likely compete in the infotainment sector instead for EVs. Google most likely will be the single greatest competitor for this space. They have two products, AOSP and Android Automotive. Android Automotive is a similar RTOS, but lacks completely in certifications and security clearance. However, if you look into its technical details, it will become apparent that this product is actually being used and focused on more of an infotainment system as well. Just look it up on Wikipedia. So, where are we on the competitor front? There is VxWorks which is operating in eight different automotive related companies. However, if you look at the list, BB is also partnered with four of the eight companies that VxWorks is partnered with. Hmmm. So it remains unclear if they are truly competing with QNX or are focusing on other sectors in the market. VxWorks seems to have better focus on the IoT market, rather than the EV market

3) *Security*: The big worry here is a big hack affecting BB software. Any software company is liable to hacks like this, but so far BB has a great track record. I won't go so far as gl say that they have never been hacked, but I will say that they haven't been hacked in such a way to cause massive damage (they used to sell phones and things, i wouldn't be surprised if there were issues there a long time ago). A big hack could severely damage BB as a company, but again, this could be said about any competitors for BB as well. BB is used because of its great security, not that it is completely indefensible. There will never be a software product that is completely indefensible. If it happens. BB will work to fix and recover the hack or error that occurred, and move on. Not much more can be said about such an event until it happens. QNX is well-poised to not experience any hack that in completely incapacitating due to it being an embedded microkernel RTOS. This means that if one part of the system goes down, it doesn't affect the other parts. Which is pretty critical for a product like a vehicle, making sure that a bug doesn't seize of up the whole car and cause it to become unresponsive and crash. Another related thing to security is just the general security of the company. How do we know BB will succeed? There is an easy answer here. Amazon. Amazon is *partnered* with BB. They could have just bought BB outright, but instead they made a 50/50 partnership. That is truly unprecedented. Amazon will want BB to succeed and will work to make it happen. Taking down BB will require taking down Amazon in part. And with their resources and capabilities.... good luck!

These are the top bearish concerns I could think of. They all have their merit, but they also have their own counter-arguments. I welcome anyone who also has bearish arguments to share. I learn the most from bearish arguments! However, simply stating that a company will do poorly without any evidence helps no one.

120,EV," Thanks man! I really appreciate it. I have been spending a lot of time these last few months researching and reading.

Here's some bearish analysis from a different comment:

Copied from a different comment:

Here's my biggest bearish analysis. In retrospect, I should have included this as well, but it slipped my mind. For me, bearish analysis is really important--only a bad investor would not want to consider both sides of the argument. Anyways, here it is:

*Bearish possibilities*:

1) *Revenue*- As mentioned in the main post, revenue is a big issue for initial investors. YoY growth has been disappointing for investors, particularly when looking at BB, which has so many clients and software products--the natural response should really be: ""What gives?"". QNX has been sold so far through one-time fees to clients. This has the advantage of easily grabbing new customers, but the disadvantage in that one-time fees is a horrible revenue model for a company. It requires constant customer acquisition YoY, or other revenue streams to support the model. BB does have other subscription-based revenue streams in their other products, but still lags behind in revenue compared to expectations (there's never a 'surge' in growth for this reason). The counter-argument here is that this is actually BB's plan in the first place. BB's disappointing and rather monetarily uneventful last 7 years was mostly spending developing their software and certifying it, as well acquiring new customers and governments. This helped them build a huge advantage in this emerging market before the big players really caught in to what was happening. They began developing technology ages before anyone else thought to, and now little to no competitors in the EV embedded RTOS space. But couldn't they have at least sold QNX for more, or perhaps for a subscription model? Perhaps, and perhaps they regret not instituting a different revenue model. But nevertheless, here's an analogy: Book authors and writers often sell their first book that they write in a series for free, or for a very low price. This is pretty common now for emerging authors who are trying to get noticed, particularly for e-books and selling in the online space. The first book isn't the money-maker, its the second. The second book is sold at full-price, as will the third, fourth, and fifth books should there be that many in the series. Once you buy the first book (or get the first book for free), you are hooked. You have to buy the second book if you enjoyed the first one. This analogy might be the same business strategy of BB. QNX is not the main product, but just the hook. IVY will be the big money maker, both that companies will want to use and also feel forced to use. IVY will run on top of QNX and will save the automaker lots of money, and BB will also make money from the automaker from a subscription-based model, and also from subscription models from selling data to different enterprises, such as insurance companies, governments, and other large institutions.

Autonomous EVs will not be allowed on the road until they have the right certifications when it comes to security. QNX is the most certified and the most secure product out there by a mile. Tesla may achieve what they are looking for over time, but so far they have not gotten there. This is concerning for anyone looking for an alternative, but even more than this, Tesla is an auto maker, which means that other car companies are not going to use their OS product since Tesla is their competitor. This can immediate root out other auto makers from beings competitive threats as well. That leaves Apple and Google. Apple has not announced any such project, but they do have great software when it comes to security. However, they would still have to nearly build this product from the ground up, and this would take a lot of time and resources. Considering they were recently looking to teaming up with Hyundai to do this, it is probably safe to assume that they are way behind on this front. They will likely compete in the infotainment sector instead for EVs. Google most likely will be the single greatest competitor for this space. They have two products, AOSP and Android Automotive. Android Automotive is a similar RTOS, but lacks completely in certifications and security clearance. However, if you look into its technical details, it will become apparent that this product is actually being used and focused on more of an infotainment system as well. Just look it up on Wikipedia. So, where are we on the competitor front? There is VxWorks which is operating in eight different automotive related companies. However, if you look at the list, BB is also partnered with four of the eight companies that VxWorks is partnered with. Hmmm. So it remains unclear if they are truly competing with QNX or are focusing on other sectors in the market. VxWorks seems to have better focus on the IoT market, rather than the EV market

3) *Security*: The big worry here is a big hack affecting BB software. Any software company is liable to hacks like this, but so far BB has a great track record. I won't go so far as gl say that they have never been hacked, but I will say that they haven't been hacked in such a way to cause massive damage (they used to sell phones and things, i wouldn't be surprised if there were issues there a long time ago). A big hack could severely damage BB as a company, but again, this could be said about any competitors for BB as well. BB is used because of its great security, not that it is completely indefensible. There will never be a software product that is completely indefensible. If it happens. BB will work to fix and recover the hack or error that occurred, and move on. Not much more can be said about such an event until it happens. QNX is well-poised to not experience any hack that in completely incapacitating due to it being an embedded microkernel RTOS. This means that if one part of the system goes down, it doesn't affect the other parts. Which is pretty critical for a product like a vehicle, making sure that a bug doesn't seize of up the whole car and cause it to become unresponsive and crash. Another related thing to security is just the general security of the company. How do we know BB will succeed? There is an easy answer here. Amazon. Amazon is *partnered* with BB. They could have just bought BB outright, but instead they made a 50/50 partnership. That is truly unprecedented. Amazon will want BB to succeed and will work to make it happen. Taking down BB will require taking down Amazon in part. And with their resources and capabilities.... good luck!

These are the top bearish concerns I could think of. They all have their merit, but they also have their own counter-arguments. I welcome anyone who also has bearish arguments to share. I learn the most from bearish arguments! However, simply stating that a company will do poorly without any evidence helps no one.

138,BB," Copied from a different comment:

Here's my biggest bearish analysis. In retrospect, I should have included this as well, but it slipped my mind. For me, bearish analysis is really important--only a bad investor would not want to consider both sides of the argument. Anyways, here it is:

*Bearish possibilities*:

1) *Revenue*- As mentioned in the main post, revenue is a big issue for initial investors. YoY growth has been disappointing for investors, particularly when looking at BB, which has so many clients and software products--the natural response should really be: ""What gives?"". QNX has been sold so far through one-time fees to clients. This has the advantage of easily grabbing new customers, but the disadvantage in that one-time fees is a horrible revenue model for a company. It requires constant customer acquisition YoY, or other revenue streams to support the model. BB does have other subscription-based revenue streams in their other products, but still lags behind in revenue compared to expectations (there's never a 'surge' in growth for this reason). The counter-argument here is that this is actually BB's plan in the first place. BB's disappointing and rather monetarily uneventful last 7 years was mostly spending developing their software and certifying it, as well acquiring new customers and governments. This helped them build a huge advantage in this emerging market before the big players really caught in to what was happening. They began developing technology ages before anyone else thought to, and now little to no competitors in the EV embedded RTOS space. But couldn't they have at least sold QNX for more, or perhaps for a subscription model? Perhaps, and perhaps they regret not instituting a different revenue model. But nevertheless, here's an analogy: Book authors and writers often sell their first book that they write in a series for free, or for a very low price. This is pretty common now for emerging authors who are trying to get noticed, particularly for e-books and selling in the online space. The first book isn't the money-maker, its the second. The second book is sold at full-price, as will the third, fourth, and fifth books should there be that many in the series. Once you buy the first book (or get the first book for free), you are hooked. You have to buy the second book if you enjoyed the first one. This analogy might be the same business strategy of BB. QNX is not the main product, but just the hook. IVY will be the big money maker, both that companies will want to use and also feel forced to use. IVY will run on top of QNX and will save the automaker lots of money, and BB will also make money from the automaker from a subscription-based model, and also from subscription models from selling data to different enterprises, such as insurance companies, governments, and other large institutions. So the bearish argument is valid in that BB's current revenue streams are weak, but the bearish argument may not hold up under new revenue models which will pick up over time.

2) *Competitors*: BB has competitors in sectors such as cybersecruity and IoTs, but when it comes to the EV market, they have a huge moat. The bearish argument here is that BB is going to be crushed in all these sectors. So let's examine these possibilities. First off, BB has focused on security as their number one priority for their software products. This is the main reason why governments have readily adopted their software products into their products and military, including high-risk security products such as jets, rockets, and other computer-based technology. They are picked because they are the most secure. IoTs vary, and often times do not need the greatest amount of security. This sector will most likely be the one that experiences the most competition. Now for the EV market. Who is BB's biggest competitor in the EV RTOS market? Tesla? Apple? Google? VxWorks? Someone else? Tesla is building their own software based on Linux. They are having a lot of trouble certifying their software. A lot of trouble. This is important when it comes to autonomous EVs.

3) *Security*: The big worry here is a big hack affecting BB software. Any software company is liable to hacks like this, but so far BB has a great track record. I won't go so far as gl say that they have never been hacked, but I will say that they haven't been hacked in such a way to cause massive damage (they used to sell phones and things, i wouldn't be surprised if there were issues there a long time ago). A big hack could severely damage BB as a company, but again, this could be said about any competitors for BB as well. BB is used because of its great security, not that it is completely indefensible. There will never be a software product that is completely indefensible. If it happens. BB will work to fix and recover the hack or error that occurred, and move on. Not much more can be said about such an event until it happens. QNX is well-poised to not experience any hack that in completely incapacitating due to it being an embedded microkernel RTOS. This means that if one part of the system goes down, it doesn't affect the other parts. Which is pretty critical for a product like a vehicle, making sure that a bug doesn't seize of up the whole car and cause it to become unresponsive and crash. Another related thing to security is just the general security of the company. How do we know BB will succeed? There is an easy answer here. Amazon. Amazon is *partnered* with BB. They could have just bought BB outright, but instead they made a 50/50 partnership. That is truly unprecedented. Amazon will want BB to succeed and will work to make it happen. Taking down BB will require taking down Amazon in part. And with their resources and capabilities.... good luck!

These are the top bearish concerns I could think of. They all have their merit, but they also have their own counter-arguments. I welcome anyone who also has bearish arguments to share. I learn the most from bearish arguments! However, simply stating that a company will do poorly without any evidence helps no one.

2020 is breaking the trend, reporting increased revenue. And they also did disclaim that coronavirus has negatively impact their business.

Here's some info on more cons:

Copied from a different comment:

Here's my biggest bearish analysis. In retrospect, I should have included this as well, but it slipped my mind. For me, bearish analysis is really important--only a bad investor would not want to consider both sides of the argument. Anyways, here it is:

*Bearish possibilities*:

1) *Revenue*- As mentioned in the main post, revenue is a big issue for initial investors. YoY growth has been disappointing for investors, particularly when looking at BB, which has so many clients and software products--the natural response should really be: ""What gives?"". QNX has been sold so far through one-time fees to clients. This has the advantage of easily grabbing new customers, but the disadvantage in that one-time fees is a horrible revenue model for a company. It requires constant customer acquisition YoY, or other revenue streams to support the model. BB does have other subscription-based revenue streams in their other products, but still lags behind in revenue compared to expectations (there's never a 'surge' in growth for this reason). The counter-argument here is that this is actually BB's plan in the first place. BB's disappointing and rather monetarily uneventful last 7 years was mostly spending developing their software and certifying it, as well acquiring new customers and governments. This helped them build a huge advantage in this emerging market before the big players really caught in to what was happening. They began developing technology ages before anyone else thought to, and now little to no competitors in the EV embedded RTOS space. But couldn't they have at least sold QNX for more, or perhaps for a subscription model? Perhaps, and perhaps they regret not instituting a different revenue model. But nevertheless, here's an analogy: Book authors and writers often sell their first book that they write in a series for free, or for a very low price. This is pretty common now for emerging authors who are trying to get noticed, particularly for e-books and selling in the online space. The first book isn't the money-maker, its the second. The second book is sold at full-price, as will the third, fourth, and fifth books should there be that many in the series. Once you buy the first book (or get the first book for free), you are hooked. You have to buy the second book if you enjoyed the first one. This analogy might be the same business strategy of BB. QNX is not the main product, but just the hook. IVY will be the big money maker, both that companies will want to use and also feel forced to use. IVY will run on top of QNX and will save the automaker lots of money, and BB will also make money from the automaker from a subscription-based model, and also from subscription models from selling data to different enterprises, such as insurance companies, governments, and other large institutions. So the bearish argument is valid in that BB's current revenue streams are weak, but the bearish argument may not hold up under new revenue models which will pick up over time.

2) *Competitors*: BB has competitors in sectors such as cybersecruity and IoTs, but when it comes to the EV market, they have a huge moat. The bearish argument here is that BB is going to be crushed in all these sectors. So let's examine these possibilities. First off, BB has focused on security as their number one priority for their software products. This is the main reason why governments have readily adopted their software products into their products and military, including high-risk security products such as jets, rockets, and other computer-based technology. They are picked because they are the most secure. IoTs vary, and often times do not need the greatest amount of security. This sector will most likely be the one that experiences the most competition. Now for the EV market. Who is BB's biggest competitor in the EV RTOS market? Tesla? Apple? Google? VxWorks? Someone else? Tesla is building their own software based on Linux. They are having a lot of trouble certifying their software. A lot of trouble. This is important when it comes to autonomous EVs. Autonomous EVs will not be allowed on the road until they have the right certifications when it comes to security. QNX is the most certified and the most secure product out there by a mile. Tesla may achieve what they are looking for over time, but so far they have not gotten there. This is concerning for anyone looking for an alternative, but even more than this, Tesla is an auto maker, which means that other car companies are not going to use their OS product since Tesla is their competitor. This can immediate root out other auto makers from beings competitive threats as well. That leaves Apple and Google. Apple has not announced any such project, but they do have great software when it comes to security. However, they would still have to nearly build this product from the ground up, and this would take a lot of time and resources. Considering they were recently looking to teaming up with Hyundai to do this, it is probably safe to assume that they are way behind on this front. They will likely compete in the infotainment sector instead for EVs. Google most likely will be the single greatest competitor for this space. They have two products, AOSP and Android Automotive. Android Automotive is a similar RTOS, but lacks completely in certifications and security clearance. However, if you look into its technical details, it will become apparent that this product is actually being used and focused on more of an infotainment system as well. Just look it up on Wikipedia. So, where are we on the competitor front? There is VxWorks which is operating in eight different automotive related companies. However, if you look at the list, BB is also partnered with four of the eight companies that VxWorks is partnered with. Hmmm. So it remains unclear if they are truly competing with QNX or are focusing on other sectors in the market. VxWorks seems to have better focus on the IoT market, rather than the EV market

As to your other comments, it's apples and oranges comparing BB before and after 2013 with new leadership under John Chen. They're executing a new business strategy.

*Bearish possibilities*:

1) *Revenue*- As mentioned in the main post, revenue is a big issue for initial investors. YoY growth has been disappointing for investors, particularly when looking at BB, which has so many clients and software products--the natural response should really be: ""What gives?"". QNX has been sold so far through one-time fees to clients. This has the advantage of easily grabbing new customers, but the disadvantage in that one-time fees is a horrible revenue model for a company. It requires constant customer acquisition YoY, or other revenue streams to support the model. BB does have other subscription-based revenue streams in their other products, but still lags behind in revenue compared to expectations (there's never a 'surge' in growth for this reason). The counter-argument here is that this is actually BB's plan in the first place. BB's disappointing and rather monetarily uneventful last 7 years was mostly spending developing their software and certifying it, as well acquiring new customers and governments. This helped them build a huge advantage in this emerging market before the big players really caught in to what was happening. They began developing technology ages before anyone else thought to, and now little to no competitors in the EV embedded RTOS space. But couldn't they have at least sold QNX for more, or perhaps for a subscription model? Perhaps, and perhaps they regret not instituting a different revenue model. But nevertheless, here's an analogy: Book authors and writers often sell their first book that they write in a series for free, or for a very low price. This is pretty common now for emerging authors who are trying to get noticed, particularly for e-books and selling in the online space. The first book isn't the money-maker, its the second. The second book is sold at full-price, as will the third, fourth, and fifth books should there be that many in the series. Once you buy the first book (or get the first book for free), you are hooked. You have to buy the second book if you enjoyed the first one. This analogy might be the same business strategy of BB. QNX is not the main product, but just the hook. IVY will be the big money maker, both that companies will want to use and also feel forced to use. IVY will run on top of QNX and will save the automaker lots of money, and BB will also make money from the automaker from a subscription-based model, and also from subscription models from selling data to different enterprises, such as insurance companies, governments, and other large institutions. So the bearish argument is valid in that BB's current revenue streams are weak, but the bearish argument may not hold up under new revenue models which will pick up over time.

2) *Competitors*: BB has competitors in sectors such as cybersecruity and IoTs, but when it comes to the EV market, they have a huge moat. The bearish argument here is that BB is going to be crushed in all these sectors. So let's examine these possibilities. First off, BB has focused on security as their number one priority for their software products. This is the main reason why governments have readily adopted their software products into their products and military, including high-risk security products such as jets, rockets, and other computer-based technology. They are picked because they are the most secure. IoTs vary, and often times do not need the greatest amount of security. This sector will most likely be the one that experiences the most competition. Now for the EV market. Who is BB's biggest competitor in the EV RTOS market? Tesla? Apple? Google? VxWorks? Someone else? Tesla is building their own software based on Linux. They are having a lot of trouble certifying their software. A lot of trouble. This is important when it comes to autonomous EVs. Autonomous EVs will not be allowed on the road until they have the right certifications when it comes to security. QNX is the most certified and the most secure product out there by a mile. Tesla may achieve what they are looking for over time, but so far they have not gotten there. This is concerning for anyone looking for an alternative, but even more than this, Tesla is an auto maker, which means that other car companies are not going to use their OS product since Tesla is their competitor. This can immediate root out other auto makers from beings competitive threats as well. That leaves Apple and Google. Apple has not announced any such project, but they do have great software when it comes to security. However, they would still have to nearly build this product from the ground up, and this would take a lot of time and resources. Considering they were recently looking to teaming up with Hyundai to do this, it is probably safe to assume that they are way behind on this front. They will likely compete in the infotainment sector instead for EVs. Google most likely will be the single greatest competitor for this space. They have two products, AOSP and Android Automotive. Android Automotive is a similar RTOS, but lacks completely in certifications and security clearance. However, if you look into its technical details, it will become apparent that this product is actually being used and focused on more of an infotainment system as well. Just look it up on Wikipedia. So, where are we on the competitor front? There is VxWorks which is operating in eight different automotive related companies. However, if you look at the list, BB is also partnered with four of the eight companies that VxWorks is partnered with. Hmmm. So it remains unclear if they are truly competing with QNX or are focusing on other sectors in the market. VxWorks seems to have better focus on the IoT market, rather than the EV market

3) *Security*: The big worry here is a big hack affecting BB software. Any software company is liable to hacks like this, but so far BB has a great track record. I won't go so far as gl say that they have never been hacked, but I will say that they haven't been hacked in such a way to cause massive damage (they used to sell phones and things, i wouldn't be surprised if there were issues there a long time ago). A big hack could severely damage BB as a company, but again, this could be said about any competitors for BB as well. BB is used because of its great security, not that it is completely indefensible. There will never be a software product that is completely indefensible. If it happens. BB will work to fix and recover the hack or error that occurred, and move on. Not much more can be said about such an event until it happens. QNX is well-poised to not experience any hack that in completely incapacitating due to it being an embedded microkernel RTOS. This means that if one part of the system goes down, it doesn't affect the other parts. Which is pretty critical for a product like a vehicle, making sure that a bug doesn't seize of up the whole car and cause it to become unresponsive and crash. Another related thing to security is just the general security of the company. How do we know BB will succeed? There is an easy answer here. Amazon. Amazon is *partnered* with BB. They could have just bought BB outright, but instead they made a 50/50 partnership. That is truly unprecedented. Amazon will want BB to succeed and will work to make it happen. Taking down BB will require taking down Amazon in part. And with their resources and capabilities.... good luck!

These are the top bearish concerns I could think of. They all have their merit, but they also have their own counter-arguments. I welcome anyone who also has bearish arguments to share. I learn the most from bearish arguments! However, simply stating that a company will do poorly without any evidence helps no one. So keep that in mind as you analyze this company or others",UncleZiggy,30,/r/stocks/comments/li0rpg/blackberry_a_dormant_giant/gn2yj97/,0.079,0.792,0.128,0.9974
164,EV," Here's my biggest bearish analysis. In retrospect, I should have included this as well, but it slipped my mind. For me, bearish analysis is really important--only a bad investor would not want to consider both sides of the argument. Anyways, here it is:

*Bearish possibilities*:

1) *Revenue*- As mentioned in the main post, revenue is a big issue for initial investors. YoY growth has been disappointing for investors, particularly when looking at BB, which has so many clients and software products--the natural response should really be: ""What gives?"". QNX has been sold so far through one-time fees to clients. This has the advantage of easily grabbing new customers, but the disadvantage in that one-time fees is a horrible revenue model for a company. It requires constant customer acquisition YoY, or other revenue streams to support the model. BB does have other subscription-based revenue streams in their other products, but still lags behind in revenue compared to expectations (there's never a 'surge' in growth for this reason). The counter-argument here is that this is actually BB's plan in the first place. BB's disappointing and rather monetarily uneventful last 7 years was mostly spending developing their software and certifying it, as well acquiring new customers and governments. This helped them build a huge advantage in this emerging market before the big players really caught in to what was happening. They began developing technology ages before anyone else thought to, and now little to no competitors in the EV embedded RTOS space. But couldn't they have at least sold QNX for more, or perhaps for a subscription model? Perhaps, and perhaps they regret not instituting a different revenue model.

168,BB," Thanks for the context. There's a very distinct difference between CarPlay as a feature in iOS, and wider efforts in Apple's *dedicated* work in vehicles. CarPlay is a single feature that directly benefits from QNX ‚Äì after all, it has to integrate with vehicles running QNX. Similar to Apple shipping software on Android and Windows, you have to speak the same language. 

Totally agree that there is space for QNX in a completely vertical Apple vehicle ‚Äì I'm just in the camp that even using it as a starting point, they'd work to very very quickly shift away.

Tesla may achieve what they are looking for over time, but so far they have not gotten there. This is concerning for anyone looking for an alternative, but even more than this, Tesla is an auto maker, which means that other car companies are not going to use their OS product since Tesla is their competitor. This can immediate root out other auto makers from beings competitive threats as well. That leaves Apple and Google. Apple has not announced any such project, but they do have great software when it comes to security. However, they would still have to nearly build this product from the ground up, and this would take a lot of time and resources. Considering they were recently looking to teaming up with Hyundai to do this, it is probably safe to assume that they are way behind on this front. They will likely compete in the infotainment sector instead for EVs. Google most likely will be the single greatest competitor for this space. They have two products, AOSP and Android Automotive. Android Automotive is a similar RTOS, but lacks completely in certifications and security clearance. However, if you look into its technical details, it will become apparent that this product is actually being used and focused on more of an infotainment system as well. Just look it up on Wikipedia. So, where are we on the competitor front? There is VxWorks which is operating in eight different automotive related companies. However, if you look at the list, BB is also partnered with four of the eight companies that VxWorks is partnered with. Hmmm. So it remains unclear if they are truly competing with QNX or are focusing on other sectors in the market. VxWorks seems to have better focus on the IoT market, rather than the EV market

3) *Security*: The big worry here is a big hack affecting BB software. Any software company is liable to hacks like this, but so far BB has a great track record. I won't go so far as gl say that they have never been hacked, but I will say that they haven't been hacked in such a way to cause massive damage (they used to sell phones and things, i wouldn't be surprised if there were issues there a long time ago). A big hack could severely damage BB as a company, but again, this could be said about any competitors for BB as well. BB is used because of its great security, not that it is completely indefensible. There will never be a software product that is completely indefensible. If it happens. BB will work to fix and recover the hack or error that occurred, and move on. Not much more can be said about such an event until it happens. QNX is well-poised to not experience any hack that in completely incapacitating due to it being an embedded microkernel RTOS. This means that if one part of the system goes down, it doesn't affect the other parts. Which is pretty critical for a product like a vehicle, making sure that a bug doesn't seize of up the whole car and cause it to become unresponsive and crash. Another related thing to security is just the general security of the company. How do we know BB will succeed? There is an easy answer here. Amazon. Amazon is *partnered* with BB. They could have just bought BB outright, but instead they made a 50/50 partnership. That is truly unprecedented. Amazon will want BB to succeed and will work to make it happen. Taking down BB will require taking down Amazon in part. And with their resources and capabilities.... good luck!

These are the top bearish concerns I could think of. They all have their merit, but they also have their own counter-arguments. I welcome anyone who also has bearish arguments to share. I learn the most from bearish arguments! However, simply stating that a company will do poorly without any evidence helps no one.

197,BB," It just seems painfully obvious that the price of BB is double what it should be because of the retail mania/pump. Same thing keeping gamestop at 50 instead of 20 is keeping BB at 12 instead of 6.

The research as to why BB might grow to 15, 20 or 30 is very interesting and compelling.

But at the end of the day, this looks very much like a moderately pumped $6 stock that has a temporary new floor at $12 due to massive interest, and which certainly has not even earned this price based on fundamentals at all.

I'm new to this but it just looks like it would be best to wait a few months for the mania to cool off and see where the stock stands. I'd feel like a right fool buying in at $12 if just deflates back to its true value once the pumping wears off and people sell, but even then, it could go up to 15, 20, 30 years down the road as they say.

1) You thinks it's BB's plan to lose money. They may expect to lose money during a pivot but they've already ""pivoted"", shedded the hardware business, and opened new markets with OS/UI licensing deals. Licensing deals aren't new and we're common in their heyday.

That is assuming the first book is an absolute smasher and the sequels are also just as good. More often than not this is not the case and in relation to BB they are not going to be pushing out products like that or haven't shown that so far. 

QNX is secure sure but it at the end of the day just the hardware correct? Companies will be pushing their own software to be compatible with that and will most likely try to implement their own software as it would give them much much more leverage and flexibility in any changes down the road. 

Assuming IVY is implement and I think the use cases for this is really fetched in the next 2-5 years but lets say it is. Why would BB be the ones collecting the data or selling it? BB would just be licensing the software they wouldn't have access to the data that the software generates.

219,BB," No problem. Yeah, there are definitely bear cases, but it seems that BB is poised to do well in the long-run, particularly with such attention and partnership from Amazon.

Digging more into the possibility of Apple or Google building a competitor OS (from another comment--it's a little out of context, but hopefully the point comes across):

I think the security certifications are harder than you might think. Tesla has been absolutely struggling to get their software certified. BB worked focusing on security for much of these last 7 years. Additionally, when considering the liabilities of an autonomous moving vehicle, do you want a company like Google, who managed to produce a certified OS in two-years [hypothetically, if they can do this within the next two years], whose software is perhaps less safe than BB, or BB, whose products are more tested and who is considered in all regards to have better safety and security clearances? In this sector, I suspect safety and security will win out every time against user experience and the partnership.

I will definitely agree that Google would be one that could achieve such a feat, but the question remains whether they could do so in such a way that derails BB as an industry leader? My bet is that they will not be able to do so, at least not within these next two years.

Anyways, I dove more into the bear case of Google or Apple building a competing product, and realized how difficult it would be for even the big guys to build a competing and trustworthy product.

I'm always looking for bear cases for BB. I find they help me understand the product better, or help me become better informed",UncleZiggy,5,/r/stocks/comments/li0rpg/blackberry_a_dormant_giant/gn1j166/,0.055,0.714,0.23,0.9958

226,BB," Thanks for your response. It is true that I am biased, so I really appreciate the feedback. I would still like to counter and expand on some of your thoughts:

1) A plan to lose money sounds a bit harsh. Perhaps more of a plan that focuses on long-term growth rather than short-term is more appropriate. BB was on a downward trend to be sure, but as of this year they are reporting increased YoY revenues, and expect the same for 2021. [see this link](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/BB/blackberry/revenue). I do think that their revenue models regarding QNX have been too safe. I think that they also commented on some of their mistakes regarding sales in an interview that I saw on a video website (not sure I can mention it here), but I don't particularly want to go digging for that link right now. You are absolutely correct in that their revenue and business model right now is not the best. I don't think it is liable to fail necessarily, but it is a glaring issue. The risk is in believing that they will be able to turn this around, that is, believing in that future market value. BB is definitely a short-term risk, but with exposure from Amazon, good things are likely to come

2) This point is also very true! The major difference between then and now is that BB's biggest old competitors are now partnered with or working with or using BB products. It is very possible that Apple or Google (if I had to guess the most likely to compete head to head in the EV software OS space) could produce a product that could knock BB out of the market. The main reason I am not worried about this is based on incentive, certification, security, and time. Apple is a big company, but when such a company already as a very successful OS, do they really want to spend the resources to develop a new one, or optimize their current one? It could take multiple years to do, if they haven't started already, and by the 2023-2025 time period, it will be far too late. If they have started such a project, say multiple years ago, they would also need to get the project security and safety certified, which is no guarantee as well. Look at Tesla and their efforts in getting their OS certified. They're struggling. I encourage you to look into this if you haven't, this is no easy task. Additionally, let's say that Google or Apple or a different company does manage to produce and certify their product, in a short amount of time. When considering the potential liability of autonomous electric vehicles, are you, as an auto maker, going to choose to use the tech giant with a more recent, less-tested product, although it is certified, or a more-tested, better certified product, that is going to have the upper hand in security? Whereas products such as IoTs may not need that level of certification and security, it is essential in products that introduce more liability. This is why the US government continues to use Blackberry products rather than the bigger tech giants. Security is a liability, and they can't afford to pick a tech giant just because they have an app store that offers 'Candy Crush'

3) You're wrong about the Amazon deal. You need to look at your primary sources again. This is a 50/50 split revenue and development partnership, not a license. This is very different than all of BB's previous clients. Amazon is not a client, but looking to utilize IVY software through integration and development with their AWS system. In what ways they will do this, we do not know yet, but we do know that the contract per their agreement is not a licensing one.

I have no idea how you roped crypto into the argument. Are you talking about cryptocurrency or cryptography or what?

QNX is an absolute smasher. The idea behind the first book analogy is that you get a lot of attention and a lot of buys. It doesn't need to make the revenue. QNX is used in the majority of the EV market share, see the post content above on their clients, and in a huge number of governments. They *absolutely* smashed it in terms of customer acquisition. They are the predominant leaders in customer acquisition by a long shot.

>QNX is secure but it at the end of the day just the hardware correct?

QNX is software not hardware. 

>Companies will be pushing their own software to be compatible with that and will most likely try to implement their own software as it would give them much much more leverage and flexibility in any changes down the road.

This is very vague, but also the answer is no. What BB has done is no light task that any given company will put their hand into and try and develop. BB has been developing QNX for *7 years*. By the time any other company attempts to do something similar, BB will be installed on 90% of the market share for autonomous vehicles at this rate (I am speculating here). They have a moat on their OS for a reason.

It is to BB's advantage to both collect and sell data. That will be part of the package deal of auto makers using their IVY software. It benefits all parties: the automakers, BB, and industries that will buy the information. Also, BB has stated that IVY will be a subscription-based model. It will NOT be licensed, which is really important because the deal will allow for BB to take ownership of that data and sell it.

>Apple will never use outside software or allow other companies to peek under the hood. They are super selective in their project as well.

This is very true.

>Google has the capitol to achieve this by themselves. The 3 potential giants wouldn't be using this??

Google and Apple in my opinion will be the two tech giants who are most likely to become competitors in this space, if at all. Both have similar problems, relating to the time, certification, and safety requirements and barriers. Both will have to overcome these factors as well as convincing others that their product is more secure than Blackberry's, which will not be an easy task.

>Most embedded systems are designed this way.

Perhaps we are using this word a different way. Amazon partners with lots of companies in less tangible ways, kind of like a 'you're doing great kid', kind of way. They do NOT partner with many companies when it comes to development. They usually outright buy these companies. The partnership with BB is a 50/50 split revenue development contractual partnership.

250,BB," I think the security certifications are harder than you might think. Tesla has been absolutely struggling to get their software certified. BB worked focusing on security for much of these last 7 years. Additionally, when considering the liabilities of an autonomous moving vehicle, do you want a company like Google, who managed to produce a certified OS in two-years [hypothetically, if they can do this within the next two years], whose software is perhaps less safe than BB, or BB, whose products are more tested and who is considered in all regards to have better safety and security clearances? In this sector, I suspect safety and security will win out every time against user experience and the partnership.

I will definitely agree that Google would be one that could achieve such a feat, but the question remains whether they could do so in such a way that derails BB as an industry leader?

For the last few years I have been into electric cars and related tech, and since I have a background in mining I'm mostly looking at future suppliers of lithium, nickel, and graphite. There are many early stage mining companies trading for pennies that are pre-feasibility. Not all of these will get funded or turn into active mines but those that do are very likely to see a 20x increase in their share price. It takes years to finance and build a mine so this isn't a short term bet, but I'm holding a few to see how they do.

I also just invest in safer bets, like EV sector ETFs: ARKW, ECAR, IDRV, DRIV. These won't be 20x but are unlikely to go to $0 (which the mining stocks most certainly can).",PhotoKaz,2,/r/stocks/comments/lif3cm/how_i_pick_a_stock_that_i_think_will_explode/gn31gf6/,0.0,0.874,0.126,0.9548

After I have a list of stocks I like, then I click on the 'analyst research' tab for each one and for most stocks it shows all the price targets of professional analyst. For example, that's how I picked UMC when they were $2.70 (now over $10) which I still own and don't plan to sell because it grows and I like the dividends. More recently I used this method to pick AGTC which is around $6 now and predicted by every single analyst on my broker's page to go up to $25-35. I own that stock too.

354,EV," Coming up with intrinsic value is a much more complicated thing, and that is what all investors are trying to do, figure out what something will be worth (or is now) and buying it if it is priced less.

That is NOT what I am talking about. I am talking about valuation in the context of price vs. fundamentals (P/E, P/B, P/S, EV/EBIT/EV/S, etc...). Two companies can have the same valuation (P/E of 10) but very different intrinsic value projections if you think one of them is mispriced at P/E 10 and the other is not.

If I say one business is paying out $10/year in earnings but growing that at 25%/year, and another is paying out $10/year in earnings, but that is growing at 1%/year, which one are you going to buy? A lot of people blindly say they want the one growing at $25%/year, because it is clearly a better company, but ignore the fact that it may cost $1000 (P/E of 100, one form of valuation) while the other may only be $100 (P/E of 10).

My point is that you need to think about how much you are paying for the company's current and future earnings, and not just which company is growing their earnings the fastest, or with the least risk of a decline, etc...",MotoTrojan,1,/r/stocks/comments/lif3cm/how_i_pick_a_stock_that_i_think_will_explode/gn3k4o7/,0.014,0.877,0.108,0.9483

361,DD," I'm going to sound like I'm marketing them, but this is just my own DD.

First I hate to call anything DD without giving negatives. Dare has a lot of negatives. Their pipeline for 2021 isn't that strong, they might not get FDA approval, they aren't making a profit, they've missed earnings estimates the past two quarters...  there's a reason the stock is so cheap right now.

However, the three reasons I'm long Dare are: Vision, Pipeline, and Grant Funding.

Dare has a great vision, plus a clear path forward. Check out their investor presentation: [https://ir.darebioscience.com/static-files/e440b4ba-2a37-4e26-accd-2335002149af](https://ir.darebioscience.com/static-files/e440b4ba-2a37-4e26-accd-2335002149af)  It's fluffy sure, but a company that knows how to market itself like that will be successful (assuming their products work)

And some of their pipeline already works, with clinical trials for repurposing existing molecules. E.g. they are testing if viagra can help with female arousal for example, think about the market if that gets FDA approval: [https://darebioscience.com/pipeline/sildenafil-cream/](https://darebioscience.com/pipeline/sildenafil-cream/)

Delta 9 is small cap weed stock play. Sure they took off once, but they have a decent growth model. More relevant to this discussion however, is they recently released guidance saying their March 30th earnings report would show a lot of positive metrics. [https://invest.delta9.ca/blogs/news/delta-9-provides-guidance-timing-for-year-end-2020-results](https://invest.delta9.ca/blogs/news/delta-9-provides-guidance-timing-for-year-end-2020-results)

However, big warning on delta 9, they didn't mention net profit, so they may have some big non-operating expenses and their profit could go down even further. It's a gamble sure, but that's the case with any small cap.

Quick edit: Grant funding on Dare. In sept 2020 they were approved for 20 million from Bill and Melinda Gates, plus their target market has a lot of grant funding available. Growth through grant funding is even better for stock price than leveraged growth.

It looks like its a CH brand and will probably do pretty well. Tesla may have the upper hand and market share now, but knowing how CH will support their own companies over western owned, Im sure CCCP will try to lessen the dominance of Tesla in favor of NIO. That could come from  extra fees slapped on Tesla, or making it harder for tesla to operate or maintain dominance. China play the long game and as soon as NIO catches up to tesla in tech and reliability, then expect Tesla to lose their market.

If the government supports them, expect them to grow huge. If the Gov doesnt give them any special benefits, then It may take longer. 

There is a lot of potential in that company if they are serious in competing in quality and tech. If they are just in it to make a quick buck, probably wont get far.

I dont think they will get much if any market share in the US or western developed countries. I expect this is going to be a very long investment 2+ years. You wont see it jump much in the next year. Depends on how serious they are about growing. This seems like a 2-3 year waiting game.

499,AT," 5-10% a year? Yeesh, get your money out of that and put it into something better. I've had multiple retirement accounts with various investments running for the last 15 years, even with poor performers still managed 10-12% a year and overall I have a 16-18% a year average even including the horrible drops last year and 2009. If you're slogging through at less than 10% a year you can and should be doing something better with your money.

As for worrying about 10+ years out, why? A new virus could come through and wipe us all out in a few years. Sure, ARK may collapse, but so could our whole economy.

519,FB," Office REITs going to be cool again?   I‚Äôve observed a decent run-up in some of the retail REITs like $SKT/ $SPG , but some of the office REITs seems to be lagging now, for example $BXP, $SLG, $VNO.  Based on some of the commentary from their results announcements, office leasing activity is still decent and many people do want to go back to the office for work ( or the big bosses wants their staff to go back).

Some part of non-essential business travel might be replaced by $ZM or other cool video conferencing tools, but I think offices would still be needed after this pandemic is under control, which I am hopeful of. Even companies like Google/FB leased more space in New York during the pandemic...

Disclaimer: I have loaded up on a couple of retail REITs like $MAC, $FRT and recently rotated some $SPG into $BXP, $VNO and $SLG, and I do own some $ZM to hedge my bets on the work from home transition.

There is no guarantees even if something looks great in the post that its a good investment.",ReddzFoxx,1,/r/stocks/comments/li9qnq/magnachip_mx_expected_to_beat_q4_guidance/gn3d0m0/,0.099,0.791,0.109,0.5413

I would suggest the MJ ETF or if you‚Äôre more interested in a stock then I‚Äôd recommend CURF (US) or APHA (Canadian). Aphria has an impending merger with Tilray (another cannabis company) that will, in the spring, merge to become the largest cannabis company in the world. Aphria shares will also convert 1 to .838, and as of now Tilray shares are worth nearly double that of Aphria, making it a bargain.

693,TFSA," It‚Äôs great you realized that vices can cost you a ton of money on the long term. 

I‚Äôve been a cannabis user all my life. Started at 15 and I‚Äôm 35 now. Still using, except I vape now for health reasons. I quit smoking. That shits terrible and a WASTE of money. But nothing wrong with enjoying life. Just know when to save and when you spend. Balance is the key. 

Now into investments, if you want to invest in gold and silver. Buy physical. Don‚Äôt invest in gold and silver stocks. You will not win. Buy physical gold and silver. 

In terms of stocks, there is a ton to invest in. If you don‚Äôt know what your doing, your almost better off to buy an etf. The ark funds are a good place to take a look but there are less risky etfs out there. But at your age, you should be more risky while your young and reduce your levels of risk as you get older. 

My advice is dollar cost your way in. Buy every month, or whenever you can. Don‚Äôt worry about the price. Just consistently buy and over the next few years you will ALMOST be guaranteed to see steady gains. 

If your Canadian, use your TFSA and RRSP accounts to your advantage. RRSP good for reducing capital gains and income tax. TFSA good for long term investments where you think you will have very good gains.

They have a market cap of 15 billion and as you noted have 7.5% of their market cap in straight cash! They have a forward P/E of 6.5 while RKT has a forward PE of 10. My brains a little tired and I didn't feel like doing the math to calculate their current P/E. Their share of the market sphere is picking up. For example, RKT is a consumer driven mortgage originator, RKT deals with people like you or I and attempts to fund and approve the loan. UWMC is a broker dealer, and deals primarily with the loan officers and lending companies directly. That share of the market sphere (broker dealers) peaked in 2008 and has subsequently fell and leveled off in 2014 at 14%. Its currently been rising for the last 7 years at a rate of 1-2% per year. **Broker dealers like UWMC dealt with roughly 20% of the mortgage market in 2019 and will capture an estimated 21% in 2020 and return to the peak 33% by an estimated 2026.** Their refinance volume obviously will shrink as it doubled with the low rates, but they should continue to capture more of the original home loans as broker dealers continue to regain market sphere, plus they are now looking to target jumbo loans adding more original loans to their books

>Commenced plans to restart jumbo offerings which are expected to go  live in March 2021 and will also materially increase purchase volume  during the remainder of 2021.

They have an industry leading close time (twice as fast as rocket, 3x as fast as industry average) and have one of the highest NPS scores in the industry. They have insane margins and their cost to originate the loans are much lower than the retail sector (RKT) They also pay a good dividend, which as price keeps dropping increases. It was up to 4.6% last time I calculated it.

>[United Wholesale has invested heavily in technology](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/02/10/united-wholesale-demonstrates-the-health-of-the-mo/). Findamortgagebroker.com, which aired a 2021 Super Bowl ad, was a massive investment. It intends to raise awareness of mortgage  brokers as a lending vehicle for homebuyers. Consumers will be able to  get referrals to a mortgage broker that will help the consumer decide  which product is best. Other technology investments include UTrack, a tracking application  that will tell the borrower, broker, and realtor the current status of a  loan. Blink+ is the company's loan origination system, which assembles  the documents and handles the nuts and bolts of putting together the  loan. Finally, EASE Docs handles the final documents for closing.¬†The payoff for that technology is not only faster times to close but  lower costs to originate. In the fourth quarter, United Wholesale took  18 days to manufacture a loan compared to 56 days for the typical retail  lender. On the conference call, CEO Tim Forrester said that United  Wholesale's cost to originate a loan (including the broker's  compensation) was $5,800 per loan compared to the average retail cost of $8,872. This translates into lower borrowing costs. United Wholesale's  average loan rate was 2.74% in the fourth quarter compared to 2.89% for  the overall industry.¬†¬†

They absolutely must have fantastic technology and workflow tools as they process loans that quickly but just go ask any of your friends or family whom are in the business what they think of them. One of my best friends is a loan officer who deals with UWMC directly multiple times a month, and he loves them, like, thrice as much as RKT whom he compares to a used car salesman (Tho RKT has good reviews online, not trying to trash them either, they're being beat down for whatever reason too)  and says the tech is so much cooler than anything else he uses. Their customers had an average credit score of 757 and a DTI of 36%. Not exactly clients I expect to be going defunct in a correction or pandemic.

>Finally, United Wholesale introduced a  quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share, which gives the company a 4%  dividend yield. This is higher than most of its competitors aside from New Residential, an originator with a different business model. T**he Street sees United Wholesale earning $1.40 next year, giving the company a price-to-earnings ratio of 7.1 times.** United Wholesale's cost advantage may allow it to take share from other lenders

Obvious cant analyze a stocks upside without downside too.

**Downside - The massive amount of shares make every dollar a 1.5b increase in cap**

Counter - Does that matter in this market? Well until UWMC I thought not, but it gives people a reason to be bearish and somewhat understandably so.

**Downside - Refinances will go down in volume causing profit to shrink if/when rates up**

Counter - but I disagree that this will cause massive downside for the company. Refinance should level off as they increase original loan volume elsewhere which is their main goal, and rates are not intended to go up anytime soon

**Downside - Big banks space - People liken big banks to home loans (BOA/WFC etc)**

Counter - They should also be taking more and more market sphere from big banks and others, not losing it no?  Who wants to go deal with wells Fargo tho? People hate those motherfuckers and for good reason lol.

**Downside - Market crash / Housing crash**

These really don't have a counter, wont be pretty for most companies should this happen and is not something that I really take into account when picking stocks in most sectors. I'm not countering the downsides to say they don't exist, I'm just interjecting why I think they're not a massive reason to be bearish, but maybe I'm blinded because I like the company and have been in it for awhile (and I made a good chunk of change before merger) - I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice and just the reasons I jumped into the stock, blah blah. Currently holding most my shares in my retirement account and recently added back in at 9.37 and 8.88 for another swing in webull. People online are saying this is heavily shorted, but highest I saw was 42% short interest (Someone said as high as 68% but I wasn't able to verify that) - Every time I type this up or paste this and modify it a little I get more bullish, double check their investor presentation and their recent SEC filings and... I want to buy more. At 8 dollars I just cant help myself, maybe I'll be broke soon, who knows.

Its currently been rising for the last 7 years at a rate of 1-2% per year. **Broker dealers like UWMC dealt with roughly 20% of the mortgage market in 2019 and will capture an estimated 21% in 2020 and return to the peak 33% by an estimated 2026.** Their refinance volume obviously will shrink as it doubled with the low rates, but they should continue to capture more of the original home loans as broker dealers continue to regain market sphere, plus they are now looking to target jumbo loans adding more original loans to their books

They have an industry leading close time (twice as fast as rocket, 3x as fast as industry average) and have one of the highest NPS scores in the industry. They have insane margins and their cost to originate the loans are much lower than the retail sector (RKT) They also pay a good dividend, which as price keeps dropping increases. It was up to 4.6% last time I calculated it.

Obvious cant analyze a stocks upside without downside too.

**Downside - The massive amount of shares make every dollar a 1.5b increase in cap**

Counter - Does that matter in this market? Well until UWMC I thought not, but it gives people a reason to be bearish and somewhat understandably so.

**Downside - Refinances will go down in volume causing profit to shrink if/when rates up**

Counter - but I disagree that this will cause massive downside for the company. Refinance should level off as they increase original loan volume elsewhere which is their main goal, and rates are not intended to go up anytime soon

**Downside - Big banks space - People liken big banks to home loans (BOA/WFC etc)**

Counter - They should also be taking more and more market sphere from big banks and others, not losing it no?  Who wants to go deal with wells Fargo tho? People hate those motherfuckers and for good reason lol.

**Downside - Market crash / Housing crash**

These really don't have a counter, wont be pretty for most companies should this happen and is not something that I really take into account when picking stocks in most sectors. I'm not countering the downsides to say they don't exist, I'm just interjecting why I think they're not a massive reason to be bearish, but maybe I'm blinded because I like the company and have been in it for awhile (and I made a good chunk of change before merger) - I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice and just the reasons I jumped into the stock, blah blah.

I want to buy more. At 8 dollars I just cant help myself, maybe I'll be broke soon, who knows.

702,WFC," I've responded a few times to these posts in the last week or so (maybe I responded to you before, sorry if I have) but uh, I agree. Its not gotten much love here on reddit, its hated in the SPAC subreddit and most threads about it have been pretty quiet here.

They have a market cap of 15 billion and as you noted have 7.5% of their market cap in straight cash! They have a forward P/E of 6.5 while RKT has a forward PE of 10. My brains a little tired and I didn't feel like doing the math to calculate their current P/E. Their share of the market sphere is picking up. For example, RKT is a consumer driven mortgage originator, RKT deals with people like you or I and attempts to fund and approve the loan. UWMC is a broker dealer, and deals primarily with the loan officers and lending companies directly. That share of the market sphere (broker dealers) peaked in 2008 and has subsequently fell and leveled off in 2014 at 14%. Its currently been rising for the last 7 years at a rate of 1-2% per year. **Broker dealers like UWMC dealt with roughly 20% of the mortgage market in 2019 and will capture an estimated 21% in 2020 and return to the peak 33% by an estimated 2026.** Their refinance volume obviously will shrink as it doubled with the low rates, but they should continue to capture more of the original home loans as broker dealers continue to regain market sphere, plus they are now looking to target jumbo loans adding more original loans to their books

If a company manages to increase revenue while the industry they are dominant in gets disrupted from A to Z it shows a lot of strength. At this moment AMD is even losing market share to Intel again.

INTC has pretty good down the board financials, pretty strong underlying fundamentals, met or beat earnings 3 straight quarters, upcoming earnings in April, so there is a strong short term growth window as well.

856,GME," I'm brand new to investing and the GME/AMC hype whipped me into it.  It took me four days to get a Fidelity account to work with, and by that time all of the magic had vanished and all that was left were bag-holders.  I didn't know that, no. I didn't know at all what I was doing, and for the most part I still don't.  It's a daunting process.

A personal rule I've added since is that if I'm not in at the beginning of a spike, stay the hell out of it.  Rule 2: sell as it flies up, don't get greedy - get your 10% or 15% gain and back out.  Sure it sucks to miss out on a $300 stock sale instead of a $150 one, but hanging on while it free-falls back down, hoping for an uptick and continued climb is a losing proposition.

I've also learned that there are clear distinctions between people who have invested $3000 in market software and spend all day watching it and the people who see a post and try to react once something's soaring.

At least I went in knowing I was being an idiot, and only with money I was willing to stuff down a garbage disposal.

873,APHA," I think you are being shortsighted.  A lot if your issues are solved by Federal legalization and the merger which you are quick to write off and are not problems exclusive to APHA. Banking access and capital raises will help all domestic pot companies. The merger gives APHA access to all of Tilrays US infrastructure, ie rapid ramp up. 

Sure there are better domestic US companies if you are looking at current profits but Aphria and Tilray have global operations. It‚Äôs still the Wild West for pot, who knows who is going to come out with the highest market share.  Personally I would invest in companies that are focused more on reinvesting revenue into the business rather than posting profit every quarter. 

I‚Äôm sure big tobacco has a solid game plan to capitalize on legal weed and they will certainly have some market share eventually but large companies are not typically very agile. Initially they are going to have to buy the supply from someone, maybe even buy up the existing companies themselves. I don‚Äôt see a large demand from the medical weed market for pot sold by cigarette companies though.

I put that into united .. right before they went Bk...because Joe Kernan said they were going BK but they could buy all there stock back and go private by just selling landing rights in Heathrow.. so I bought it and it didnt go BK and instead went to 15k in a year.  That I put into some of the early dot coms which took it to 30k and then got into trouble with life and had to sell it so I could keep my business afloat.  in 2018 i decided to put the 30k back in.

894,NYC," The real question isn't whether the worker is happy to be back, it is whether the employer is happy to not pay high rents for city buildings to keep centralized locations, to allow them to employ workers that would have been located in high income zones like NYC and instead higher them remotely from rural GA and pay them a fraction.

The economics of the office are going to be the driving force.  If your company can perform at 90% of its office located efficiency at 80% of the cost, they will stay remote and hire more cheap workers with the operational savings to make up the performance shortfall.

Not all companies can do this but many can and will in my opinion.

I made my decision and unless I hear horrible news I plan on holding for years whether they go up or down between 2021 and 2026 or 2031 as an example. 

It also depends on your level of confidence with the company. Theres some companies I check up on pretty frequently, but for example, I bought roku around $40. Saw it hit like $120, did a quick DD and still liked everything. Recently saw it hit $400. I sold a couple shares just ensure some profits no matter what, but unless we get a market crash and I can buy more, im probably not going to check it again for atleast a few months.

Same thing with SBUX. It was valued around 50 billion at the time. I thought it was worth a minimum of 90 billion after including a margin of error. It went a little past that, sold some to ensure profits and now I'm just holding and will probably buy more during a market crash/correction, but I don't pay it any attention between the big run-ups and market downswings.

If I think my play was more risky then ill keep tabs on it, but I still don't plan on selling unless its tanking 20-30% while everything else is stable or rising.

Edit: with roku, my analysis was that they were taking over a much larger percentage of smart TV's and general streaming than anticipated by the market. Once that was obvious by news sources and prices, I secured profits. Once Starbucks got past my evaluation, I secured profits. I will always keep up with a more speculative play, though I try to limit those. Some just show too much potential upside for me to not take a small position though.

978,NAKD," Yall. I have a wash sale rule question. I'm having difficulty pairing up my new average and SOFI invest support hasn't gotten back to me yet.

I purchased various shares of NAKD over the last few months.  
Purchase Price, Number of Shares, total cost of purchase

0.69 83 57.27

0.64 100 64

0.68 275 187

0.74 150 111

0.72 100 72

0.82 200 164

2.68 34 91.12

942 746.39

From my calculations, I have an average purchase price of .79.

I sold all of these shares on February 2nd at the bottom of the market on that date (I know, bad move) at .86 cents a share for a total of $811.63. A gain of $65.24.

I decided to jump back in at 1.52 (65 shares, 98.77 total capital back in) on February 10th.

But, curiously, my average is now sitting at 2.47. Is this because there was a loss on the 34 shares that I purchase at 2.68?

I'm just having a hard time with the math to get to that 2.47 average. Anyone have any insight? What is the formula used to reach that 2.47 average ?

With so much other pressing legislation still needing to go over before they go to making weed legal, I think it's a little too early.  
But, with that said, I'm looking more at the companies that would supply and currently do supply the materials to grow weed. GRWG is one of the bigger names.  
These companies do currently sell products to cannabis producers in the states and more states are making weed legal.   
Companies like this will still have a huge upside if weed becomes federally legal also.

For poor people like us it is matter of guessing to be honest, and it is really more about how much risk you can tolerate.

For me Tesla should reasonably be between $800 and  $900. Anything more than that and I would sell, and anything lower than $800 I really consider buying it the money is available.

That isn‚Äôt based on solid data and equation, but more like the fact that reasonable pro analysts seem to congregate around $850 these days and they have been maintains at that level, if it goes lower I expect people to swoop in and buy it to bring it back up.

You can of course put in the work and learn how to do it like the pros, but I really don‚Äôt have time for that, I just pick a few companies that I know are improving overtime and see where they have been trading, see what kind of future potential news can be predicted. Then I buy the closest dip knowing that if they drop further I just need to sit on them and wait for them to catch up to their potential.

Personally I don‚Äôt buy stocks in companies that I don‚Äôt think has a secure business and obvious path for upward mobility. 

A person with lower risk tolerance may want to stick with proven names like DIS, BRK, or ETFs. This way you give up the potential upside for protection from significant downside.

1049,ALL," It's not like there's a store and you buy them from this place. It's peer to peer with a broker.

You might be selling and I might be buying. We both talk to the broker. I have no idea who you are. You have no idea who I am. But we ALL know Bob the Broker so we just talk to him.

If you are trying to buy for a price greater than or equal to the price I am selling, a deal happens. Bob matches us and money changes hands, and the stock changes hands. Heck, maybe Bob puts some money in his own pocket if you offered to pay more than I asked to get.

If you paid 5,000 then... that's the last known price. It's not a price tag though. It has NO RELATION to any future deal. 

Now you leave and another guy wants to buy. He talks to Bob. What he's really gonna get is a QUOTE. Based on all the unmatched sell attempts waiting on Bob's desk we can make up a real number now. Last known sell price is irrelevant. 

If Bob is kind, he will give the buyer a quote for the sale price of the CHEAPEST one on his desk. Remember, we can all ask for whatever damn price we want and we will. Bob has em all. That cheapest price might now be 100 even though the last successful deal was 5,000. 

Does the buyer accept? If the buyer says yes, the match is made, buyer and seller are put together, and the last sell price is now 100. And... maybe Bob is less kind than we thought and the seller really was asking for 95, the buyer paid 100, the seller got 95, and Bob put 5 quietly in his pocket. It's good to be the middle man.


The number you see in reports as historical data (or 15 min old data on google) is that idea of last sold prices. Not price tags.

As for the transition to renewables...as long as the population increases the most in the third world and the emerging markets...the people there won‚Äôt drive an EV anytime soon, and needs oil to be able to industrialize and raise their standard of living.

With that said, their Snapdragon technology is incredible for mobile and laptops. I think they are definitely able to get to the $170-180s range and probably would've if it wasn't for the chip shortage.

The thing I would recommend not doing is throwing it back into the market on a single security without extensive research. Especially if you‚Äôre a gambler. I understand that feeling I personally can get easily addicted to anything from sugar to drugs to exercise... so I‚Äôve had a gambling binge too... and that‚Äôs what options are if you don‚Äôt do extensive research and have a firm and fundamental understanding of the time decay, Greeks, and what truly makes a good premiums for a contract. 

You are not going to become a millionaire buying contracts where the premium shot up 1000% the day before, and you‚Äôre seeing a ‚Äúquality‚Äù DD on it the day after it does that.

As u/advicevirtual mentioned AAL's Financials are ass cheeks. They bring in the revenue but there expenses are very high, and they carry a lot of debt compared to their peers.

Both Delta, and especially Southwest are doing a good job in keeping expenses down during this period. While they are all losing money (to be expected w/ covid) I would expect SW and Delta to bounce back quicker, which I guess is reflected in their current share prices.

I will say though. Looking at the 5yr trend AAL was gradually going down, but pre-pandemic they sat steady averaging high $20's - mid $30's. They also have the most passenger traffic compared to its competitors.
