109,BIG," Options are pretty easy.  Basically you are paying a 'premium' which is the right to buy/sell the contract (1 contract = 100 shares).  So you take the 'strike price' and either add or subtract the premium to that to figure out your total for a 'breakeven price'.  Once you go past that threshold you will be in the profits.  Basically the point of the options is where one person thinks the stock will go down, and another thinks it will go up (by expiration of option contract date), so they try to make money off of the person with the opposite outlook.  

Example.  Say xxx is trading at 100$ right now.  I sell an option call at a 110 strike, for 1.5.  So the $1.5 is the premium (which is always times by 100, which is $150), which is what you pay to be able to buy the contract of 100 shares of xxx at the $110 strike (which equals $1,110) in the future.  You buy the $110 strike anticipating the stock to raise over the $110 in value in the future, which will turn this trade profitable for you.  Remember, you must add in the 'premium' you paid for the contract onto the 'strike price' to get your 'breakeven' number (though other variables affect this, but this is the general rule).  So your premium is $1.5 and the strike is $110, so add them together.  This makes your break even price at $111.5, so the stock needs to go over this for a profit.  

&#x200B;

This is the basics of a call.  A put is where you believe the price will drop.  So if you buy a put/call you can only lose the money you paid for the 'premium' for the contract.  If you sell a put/call, you could be on the hook for paying for 100 shares at the agreed strike price as your loss potential.  BIG TIME DIFFERENCE.  So starting out, only 'buy' a call/put.  Selling a call/put means you need to have either 100 shares or able to buy 100 shares.  A stock like Amazon makes selling options almost impossible for most retail investors since you need to be able to cover if you have to buy.  

&#x200B;

Keep learning more but the essence of options isn't that hard.  Just got to get used to the terminology and how it works.",trailblazzr,213,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lg57r6/weed_about_to_make_me_a_millionaire_in_2021/gmpgvjq/,0.049,0.872,0.079,0.9031

I didn't ""time the market"" too well, started buying in more (including US companies), and saw losses on a bunch on them after the hype died down. A few of my investments got bought out for a small fraction of their peak. Many just plummeted in value and seemed like they would stay there. Others plateaued. One tripled (TRUL, I only had a small stake).

Overall, I wasn't stupid about it... I had taken some profits, scaled out some when they started to drop, and thankfully came out well ahead despite the remainder of the investments going into the shitter. But the volatility and really unclear valuations scared me off from getting back into it. If I sold off everything when the hype peaked, I would have 8x my total investment... If I hadn't scaled out I probably would have lost like 60% even after the recent rebound. I felt veeeerrry lucky to have come out ahead at all though.

Even now, I'm too worried that this is just another bubble for weed stocks lol",OldManJimmers,4,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lg57r6/weed_about_to_make_me_a_millionaire_in_2021/gmpyc38/,0.095,0.771,0.134,0.7987

Another, more intelligent way of looking at it is that a bunch of retards used a two bit brokerage for children, and their retard-strength courage  failed them when that garbage brokerage ran out of cash and was forced to pause trading for liquidity reasons, destroying their momentum.  One of many, many reasons why it's important to use a big boy brokerage, and not a stupid tech startup, if you're going to be fucking around with the stock market in ""creative"" ways.

You could learn that lesson, or you can go on screaming about the conspiracy that forced you to use a steaming pile of trash brokerage because it has a shiny UI and plays fun sound effects.

213,GME," If you viewed the market as some sort of retail David vs Hedge Fund Goliath, then sure, it would all seem like the rich and powerful screwed over the masses.

But the reality is that retail investors only accounted for about 20% of the total float.  All the horseshit about ""paper hands"" is utterly meaningless when large institutional investors are seeing 2000% returns, and deciding to jump off (https://www.marketwatch.com/story/large-gamestop-shareholder-must-asset-management-sold-off-its-stake-2021-01-28). 

Meanwhile theres plenty of evidence that Hedge funds *made* money by going long on GME as well. (https://www.reuters.com/article/retail-trading-senvest-idUSL8N2K380V) 

Just those two holders account for about 10% of all outstanding shares. 

So, if you think that some small hedge fund like Melvin Capital has the ability, power, and influence to cause the NSCC and DTCC to raise their margin requirements in the hopes that specific retail brokerages wouldnt be able to afford the collateral, all in an effort to torpedo a tiny squad of retail investors... well, that would be quite an amazing story, and I would wonder how those Hedge funds, with that kind of power, aren't making _shitloads more_ money than they otherwise do.",xenarthran_salesman,9,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lg2vu8/wsb_gme_infinity_war/gmphf0b/,0.031,0.809,0.16,0.9747

217,TV," You owe it to yourself to just binge watch the MCU. Ignore any TV shows. Just the main movies. Think of it like 1 giant awesome tv show. People binge tv all the time. 

Imagine 2 seasons of tv where each season has a 1.5 billion budget. That's gotta be worth watching regardless of genre.

I grew up with no super heros. At all. I thought cartoons of super heros were pointless and yea I judged comic books as childish. So I am not biased.

I watched Iron Man in 2008 and thought it was okay. Later on around 2016 I decided to sit down and watch the MCU in order up to Avengers 2 or so was out by then.

I remember thinking ""This is pretty good""

But then I watched the third Captain America movie, Civil War. And I watched Infinity War. And I was just ..... hooked.

Ragnarok (the third Thor movie) is also incredible and Endgame is just ..... so special.

What is incredible to me is that they had this 20 movie plan with a rough idea of how to end the 4th Avengers movie. They built up this tension between Iron Man and Captain America

All these characters I thought were stupid when I was young were now on screen and written with so much care. Also, special shout out to Captain America 2 : Winter Soldier, which can stand on it's own as a non-superhero movie.

Also, Guardians of the Galaxy (""We Are Groot"") did a better job in one movie of building chemistry with and making me care about a group of characters than the first Avengers did with like 4-6 movies. It's incredible.

I went from ""meh"" to being more excited for Endgame (4th avengers movie, basically the end of all storylines up til that point) than I have ever been for a movie.

I cry when I rewatch the Youtube videos of theater reactions. I get goosebumps and feel it all over again. And I think superheros are stupid.

But Captain America is just a good man. There's something universal and human and incredible about the idea superheros aren't superhero's due to powers. They're what they are because of altruism ; their unwavering sacrifice and willingness to do the right thing.

Half the avengers (Hawkeye, Scarlet Johanson's breasts, Tony Stark) are just regular human beings. Willing to die to save people because it's the right thing to do.

Anyway the movies are just incredibly well-written and you never anywhere else get a chance to see up to 10 characters continually cross movies in ongoing storylines.",supertimes4u,9,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lg2vu8/wsb_gme_infinity_war/gmpxspk/,0.067,0.797,0.136,0.9819

#EDIT: 
Guys, stop giving me awards. I appreciate the sentiment, but you should not be spending your money on these. **If you want to help out, message the mod team. Tell them that they need someone to help with this.** I've spoken to close to a thousand people in the last week about GME and how scared they are, and all of them reached out because they saw my comments in the megathreads. I've talked to 10 people who were seriously talking about killing themselves. I do not give a shit, genuinely, if I'm unbanned, but if I'm going to stay banned, **someone** needs to do this. Someone needs to help, and the mods are acting straight childish on this one, saying that it's not their problem and that they don't see why it matters. Message them. Message /u/OPINION_IS_UNPOPULAR. We need help.

240,GL," He was trading options and those were call options, you buy call option when you expect or hope the price of the stock will rise within a timeframe. He bought 30 contracts that each enables him to buy 100 shares Gamestop stock at the price of 40$ each. He had a strike date of 19th Feb which allows him to do so until that date. Each contracts allows him to buy 100 shares of the stock, with 30 contracts he had the right to buy 3.000 shares for 40$ each before the expiration date (February 19th). But if Gamestop shares are below 40$ on 19th February his contracts expire worthless because why would he buy the stock for 40$ when the stock is for example 17$ so then he lost his whole amount of 1200$ which he used to buy the contracts for. But since the price of Gamestop skyrocketed far beyond the 40$ mark he could at any point buy 3.000 shares at 40$ each share so when the price reached 340$ he can in theory buy the 3.000 shares for 40$ each and instantly sell them for 340$ each making his contracts have this insane value, in most cases you should not do that but instead sell the options since time has value on options and therefore you would lose that value if you exercise them early, exercising the option meaning using your right to buy the shares for the strike price in this example 40$. The reason for the low price of the contracts when he bought them is because it was very unlikely that Gamestop would ever reach 40$ in that timeframe which is calculated using few metrics called the greeks which you could google if you wan't to learn more about that.

Odds were, February 19th would come and go and GME would stay below $40, so the contracts would be worthless (why use the contract when you can buy at market price for less?).

They make their money through people's attention, not through their trading/investing skills. People like Mark Cuban, Chamath Palihapitiya, and Elon Musk similarly make money through hype. 

There's nothing wrong with any of this. Everyone uses what skills they have to get by. But you need to use critical thinking if you want to avoid throwing away your cash.

CMPS is backed by Peter Thiel and did an IPO in the 4th quarter and now has a market cap ~$2b. There are a bunch of smaller  players. I bought in from October til 12/15. Everything I bought in before 12/15 is up from 5-250%. Unfortunately I did almost half my buying on 12/15 because I FOMOed and those three are from -30% to 0% returns. 12/15 was the recent high point for whatever reason and everything has pretty much been about even since then.

Personally I still contend that GME is extremely over shorted, and  HFs have done everything they can to prevent their meteoric losses. The math just does not line up with the notion they covered, and as such I continue to hold a small stake - more for just seeing what happens than any sort of real reliance on it making money. 

No matter how you slice it, this has exposed that the markets are not an equal playground for all those involved... and the cost of cheating pales in comparison to the rewards of doing so.",ncshooter426,101,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lg0mn2/gme_29/gmp7hfs/,0.088,0.839,0.072,-0.4939

561,AMC," At the end of the day, I lost money. In this case, knowing a platform that I'm expecting to continue to onboard the new joiners can suddenly allow only sells is a risk I need to account for.. and I care to understand the additional detail that it's probably because they promote margin to an unusual extent and got into money trouble. I actually did foresee they might block new accounts, but not that they would allow only sells - It feels like a regulatory concern, and it's enough of a concern that there will be hearings now. I plan to learn as much as I can from the hearings for future reference and/or changes to rules.

I knew it was ridiculous - but with the amount of hype/press and time it would take for people to join the bandwagon, that was the (short-term) point! With the amount of ongoing hype, there was another day or two at least (or at least the morning). Interest in the stupid thing was off the charts, and had some small chance of turning into a real play soon depending on the amount of activity and details of the shorting if it were to persist (and I was going to dive deeper the next day after likely selling). Slightly longer term, AMC is likely strengthened by a higher stock price and can ride out the pandemic better - which was their main risk and cause of their initially low price. There's a significant self-fulfilling aspect to their case (and this isn't even a bad thing - it's good when investment has this effect), which factored into my decision.

As I said, I'd done wackier trading and a lot of watching outside of stocks before too, and was familiar with that kind of game. I'm not new to that nor stocks, and own a lot more of reasonable things. They managed to be less dependable than even those markets (being unspecific in wording due to automod), and we got the kind of sudden act of god that traders don't like to see.",NewFolgers,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfom8l/gme_documentary_the_story_so_far/gmp0y8i/,0.055,0.822,0.123,0.9746

I only bought 5 shares and put a stop order on 1 at 210, and the other 2 at 120. Then sold the last 2 at 90. So made a little something back.

716,GME," > Dumb question: what do people mean when they say average down?

If you buy 1 share for $100, your average cost is $100/share. If the price of the stock is $90, you are currently down $10. 

If you buy another share for $50. Your average cost is $75/share ($150/2 shares). If the price of the stock is $90, then you are up $15 per share, for a total of $30.

In this example, you are currently down $10 on your first share and up $40 on the second The results in a net of being up $30.

Basically, when the price goes down, you buy more shares at a cheaper price in the hopes that the gains from those cheaper shares offset the losses from the higher costs ones. 

It should be noted, while this is a valid strategy on fundamental companies/stocks, it's a risky move for something like GME, which is a stock that probably belongs at $15-20/share.",Berris_Fuelller,10,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lg5lrv/gme_holders_on_29/gmqe370/,0.046,0.827,0.127,0.893

Hold in cash-accounts and force the squeeze. Also, they cannot force you to liquidate if you don't have margin.

Margin allows you to borrow against the assets in your account. They can also borrow YOUR assets (GME), as well tho.

819,GME," Even if I take away all the squeeze potential, is investing GME a good investment? I would say yes that GME is a good high risk and high reward investment. Ryan Cohen, the founder of chewy.com, did a light version of a hostile takeover of GME. I believe he has the leadership abilities, his new hires for leadership positions, and the growth of the video game industry are the prime ingredients for GME to take control of the e-commerce of video game products and accessories product lines.


The video game industry is worth billions of dollars, and GME has a very small slice of the pie. This means that GME has the potential to grow sales, and online sales grew over 300% last year, while under boomer management. That means GME has a shot of gaining a foothold and building a moat in the video game e-commerce space.

Some people are quick to point out that games are going digital. I agree that digital sales are there, but people like their physical games. Besides video games, customers still need to buy video game systems, controllers, and people like to buy accessories. On top of gaming, GME wants to become a place to hang out at, and I can see them expanding into the board games and trading card game segments of the industry. With these expansions and e-commerce, Ryan Cohen wants to also to take advantage of the infrastructure to give customers a two hour delivery timeframe for goods sold at the retail locations.

We got some good potential for the stock, but what is it worth today? I wanted to be conservative with my estimate, for my price target. I compared the p/s of Chewy.com and the p/s of only e-commerce sales to
GME. If I want both numbers to be equal, I would have to bump GME to be about $160-180 a share. I want to be conservative, so my price target to sell will be $150, and I will sell most of my shares.",SwoleJohll,80,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lg8pks/yall_need_to_let_gme_happen/gmqekx0/,0.01,0.868,0.122,0.9836

831,SOLO," Some tidbits 

Most used Greeks 

**Delta (D for dollar)** - amount the option price increases if the stock price goes up by $1 on a call, or down $1 on a put

**Gamma (G for gravity)** - amount delta increases when a stock goes up/ down. Gravity = acceleration

**Theta (T for time)** - amount of value the option loses each day. The closer to expiration the higher this value gets.

**IV** - implied volatility explained above. Avoid high IV when possible. A very general of thumb I use is try to avoid 120%+ IV. Some stocks are always volatile that‚Äôs an exception

**IV crush** - this is very painful lesson most new traders will make and it will suck when it happens. Don‚Äôt commit too much of your portfolio until you see it happen. 

*Ex: If you buy a contract at 300% IV and it drops to 100% overnight it will often cause a massive loss to the contract.. even if the stock moves your way*


**Spread options** - are a little advanced but lower risk significantly. You buy an option and sell a cheaper one. It limits your potential gains but reduces IV crush and Theta decay

Ex: 
You simultaneously 
- buy SOLO 3/19 10c for $150
- sell SOLO 3/19 12.5c for $100. 
Net cost = $50

- The 12.5c will never be worth more then the 10c
- 5:1 Risk reward 
- The most you can gain is $250 ‚Äî if your contracts expire, you make $1 for every cent SOLO is over $10.00.. up to $12.50
- You can sell your 10c and buy your 12.5c to close the contract early like a normal option, so don‚Äôt feel like you have to hold it to expiry

**Pure stocks** - everyone says trade paper but it‚Äôs platitudes - almost no one does. Trading straight stocks puts skin in the game while you learn. ***Remember 90% on options expire worthless***

**Don‚Äôt overcommit to a sector or the market** - The market is full bull right now, so most calls are green. That‚Äôs great until it isn‚Äôt. And it isn‚Äôt can happen in a day. I had my whole portfolio invested in plays in and the August pullback hurt bad.",desemus,362,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfxux0/stuff_for_new_traders_no_gme_discussion/gmp32td/,0.095,0.811,0.094,0.5703

Like I have a 401k at work where all you can invest in is conservative index funds. I‚Äôve made nice gains with it over the years and rarely goes down by much, but if you compare it to the gains of my 10 years in AAPL it‚Äôs not even close, yet I consider AAPL barely more risky than an SP500 index. It rarely goes down more than about 20% during its down phases (and usually when it‚Äôs doing poorly it‚Äôs just staying flat) and over the long run it always goes up. The bottom is never going to fall out from under a company with the most popular phone in the world and $100B in cash.

877,BX," FINRA numbers for yesterday are confusing to me, especially when comparing to FINTEL numbers.  

[This link for FINRA data.](https://www.finra.org/finra-data/short-sale-volume-daily)

So FINRA's numbers for 2/8/2021 are:    
  
- 6,404,809 Short Sale Volume  

- 11,348,581 Overall Volume.  

FINTEL'S numbers for 2/8/2021 are:  

- 6,404,809 Short Sale Volume (These match).  

- 25,641,700 Overall Volume.  

So Short Sale Volume the same, but Overall Volume is 14,293,119 higher than what's in FINRA's daily release.  

- I know neither FINTEL nor FINRA numbers are perfect, but it seems odd the that Short Sale Volume would match but Overall Volume would be significantly different.  

- I suppose the difference could be from pre- and after-market hours...but then that assumes that during those hours there were 14 million shares sold and none of them were sold short.  

I quickly looked at other exchanges to see if they had any Short Sale Volume on 2/8/2021:  

- NASDAQ BX was 43,273 Short Sale Volume  

- NASDAQ PSX was 30,585 Short Sale Volume  

- Bats BZX Exchange was ~634k Short Sale Volume  (my excel crashed before I could get the last 3 digits - dang 2+ million rows of data)  


TLDR;  Basically, the actual total short volume that FINTEL seems to use is the FINRA numbers.  But the overall volume...well idk what FINTEL does.  They have about 14 million more in the volume than FINRA provides, so idk where they're getting it.

976,ZOM," Let me tell you, it's interesting. I've been watching since about December when it was near .20, they have a new platform coming out called TruForma which is going to use bulk acoustic wave technology to analyze assays in clinic, so some pretty common older cat issues with adrenal glands for example will be able to be done in like 15 minutes as opposed to being a whole week or so with sending it to the lab, waiting, etc. 

I've seen (unconfirmed) mention of the cost of running a TruForma test being priced lower than a traditional lab-test and Heather Morley, one of their board members who has a DVM I believe, has also addressed the concern in a press video they put out, saying they were aware of issues like the 2:1 vet school debt ratio making it harder for new products to emerge and that was being taking into account. With the upsell being cheaper tests for the same price to clients, I see the biggest concern, in my opinion, as the initial cost of the platform. If it's a few thousand dollars or even 10,000$ I would suppose smaller clinics might be tempted but if it's too expensive it won't have enough market penetration.

TruForma, if they expand the brand which is seems they are with ongoing research, could help shift lab work from lab to clinic, ceding profits to the actual clinicians rather than labs. Keep your eyes on these guys because the fact is veterinarians make pretty shitty pay and if ZOM can find a way to increase a Vet's profits while simultaneously decreasing their reporting times (a huge boon to pet owners who can afford these tests in the first place) without having too much initial overhead they could put labs up to a serious existential fight",LydiasHorseBrush,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lg4fsn/heres_an_update_on_which_tickers_were_mentioned/gmqoov1/,0.046,0.853,0.101,0.9566

>why was it just pushed under the radar and no one talks about it anymore?

Because there is no short squeeze possible with AMC. AMC raised an addition 300 million during the insane market run up and sold 62.5 Million shares for just $5 a share when AMC was trading around $12 a share. They did this because $5 a share was an incredibly good deal for them. Institutional investors dumped their AMC bags on you guys. majority of the shorts exited when they saw what was going on with GME, You guys are retarded for not paying attention to all of this. There will be no AMC short Squeeze and you will be stuck holding AMC at $14 a share for a very longtime, maybe forever, because even when Movie theaters come back, AMC shares are more diluted now then they were in the past. It is going to take them forever to recover legitimately.

AMC raised an addition 300 million during the insane market run up and sold 62.5 Million shares for just $5 a share when AMC was trading around $12 a share. They did this because $5 a share was an incredibly good deal for them. Institutional investors dumped their AMC bags on you guys. majority of the shorts exited when they saw what was going on with GME, You guys are retarded for not paying attention to all of this. There will be no AMC short Squeeze and you will be stuck holding AMC at $14 a share for a very longtime, maybe forever, because even when Movie theaters come back, AMC shares are more diluted now then they were in the past. It is going to take them forever to recover legitimately.

Yeah the pandemic was particularly bad for movie theatres. And in the next year if covid stops being a major concern there might be more people going to movies just for the nostalgia of it. But lets be real consumer tastes have changed, and more importantly the people who are actually in the business of selling movies are finding out they can do just fine going straight to streaming so there's going to be less and less movies that you HAVE to see in theatres if you want to see it at all in the first year.

1170,GME," None of the original OGs bought GME purely because there was a chance of a short squeeze. The Catalyst was Ryan Cohen, but fundamentally this company was undervalued when it was trading in the teens. Some of the smart guys have provided valuations in the upper 40s to as high as 169$ per share. When GME was above this price, they knew GME was overvalued, and were fully aware there was a short squeeze going on. Either way, there was no reason for them to risk the millions in unrealized gains for potential millions more. Anyone buying at 300$ or more, were buying the hype and it may have potentially worked out if buying wasnt restricted. Its amazing how much the trading in one or two securities impacted the stock market as a whole.

1232,GME," I‚Äôm 30 years old. I grew up with GameStop. Waited in line for midnight release of every Halo at GameStop. The new consoles have nothing to do with their success or failure though. Every retailer ran out of stock, by design, because Sony and Microsoft weren‚Äôt making enough to artificially create more demand. It didn‚Äôt matter where they were sold, they were sold out - and to be honest GameStop was mostly only offering these $850+ bundles with useless games no one wanted, so I got mine from Walmart for $500. I haven‚Äôt stepped foot in a GameStop in years because they are irrelevant. That‚Äôs not a regurgitated argument, that‚Äôs my opinion based on my experience. 

GameStop could very well survive and run a profitable business if they have success in reimagining their brand, but they would have to DRASTICALLY increase revenue to support a stock price even at $25-30. I think they waited too long to change. They will never be the dominant force in the industry like they were in the mid 00‚Äôs. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve been encouraging people to sell.

3. A bit of both, and Netflix buys AMC and starts prodding people to theaters, Netflix stock rises.

1393,BB," I'm bullish on this one not because of the future possibilities but they have an existing product that prints cash. They security suite (currently called Cylance AV / Optics) is going to get expanded and rebranded into the BB Security suite.

Now, they'll completely fuck this up and BB is \*terrible\* at marketing, but they sell the everloving piss out the product now to MSPs and they're getting tons of $$$ / month with very little overhead. Adding larger revenue streams should boost profits going forward.

Not to mention the recent deal with ticker: BIDU to provide their QNX System to over 175 million EV‚Äôs. They‚Äôve successfully moved on from their product sales of phones and at most majority of revenue comes from the software they provide to homes, stations, and EVs.

They have completely wiped their department, obviously bringing in the Almighty papa chen who‚Äôs know for reviving software companies and who also announced today they signed a contract to provide power and cyber security to ISS for the next moon landing.

If you look at the analytics of their department, they revamped the company completely. By browsing linkedin they have a 3:1 ratio of engineers to sales, which means they are keen on developing their product and not so worried about sales.

1877,GME," On 1/28/21, Fidelity was charging 29% interest to borrow GME

On 2/2/21, Fidelity was charging 20.5% interest to borrow GME

On 2/6/21, Fidelity was charging 15.5% interest to borrow GME

On 2/8/21, Fidelity was charging 14.5% interest to borrow GME

On 2/9/21, Fidelity was charging 8% interest to borrow GME

Each time the cost to borrow drops, it indicates there is more supply of lending shares readily accessible to the market - and consequently, less ""panic demand"" by short sellers being forced to cover.

The falling cost to borrow GME shares means there is a lesser likelihood of renewed short-squeeze than some might be hoping for.

Edit: As of 2PM on 2/9/21, Fidelity was charging 13.75% interest to borrow GME. The 8% from this morning appears to have been a temporary anomaly. The downward trend in cost to borrow has resumed a more gentle downward slope: 16.75% >> 15.5% >> 14.5% >> 13.75%

I say ""mail order"" but you can get your 3-month order at your local CVS.

Amazon can't compete with that (unless they get into that space and start making deals with insurance companies.)

(Edited to add parenthetical and the following:)

My employer is self-insuring. They pay the bills but Blue Cross does the medical and dental administration and CVS Caremark does the drug administration. I'm guessing that being self-insured is common to most Fortune-listed companies, so it's a good business to be in and I don't think there are a lot of competitors.

Sources for information provided? Just trust him, he's been around the block. It's just a new account, he promised.
And CVS is his shopping spot, and that's a good investment!

Did they have two good quarters since the acquisition of Aetna? Sure. Does that promise yields? No.

Sometimes you've missed the train, and CVS had a rebound exactly like they have for the last 4 years. Why buy on the high? If you didn't catch last spring's dip, wait for the next one.

Further, for a ""retail"" commodity, it has only 7% store front, the rest is integrated healthcare and pharmaceuticals. And that's not a safe investment in the current bloom of new ventures.

Maybe some people just want their high price, low return stock to bump, but if you buy today it won't be yours.

You have to believe in their transition to a health-care destination though, and that putting nurse practitioners in the store is going to make up for the declining margins in the retail/LTC business.    


I think that's the case, as people don't want to go see a doctor for minor things that are easily diagnosed and treatable.  Having the pharmacy and diagnosis in a convenient location could make this a big moat for the company.

3. Their healthhub stores are still mismanaged and understaffed so they'll never reach their full potential.
4. Covid vaccine administration is a mess. They're scrambling to find staff after having staff at barebones levels. They won't be able to handle the roll out to the general public just like their roll out of the yearly flu shots.
5. Their growth every quarter goes from cutting hours from store employees too save payroll. 
6. Their Carepass program that they tout to their investors is trash. The numbers might as well be fake due to the Wells Fargo like pressure for employees to sign people up everyday or risk getting written up, having their hours reduced and other forms of retaliation.

It asked a few basic questions, found my doctor, contacted him, moved the prescription to fulfillment the next day it arrived a day later.

That's groundbreaking service compared to CVSs mail order mess.  Don't underestimate Amazon.

2057,BB," Kinda depends on the success of their new product.

BB has had a history of questionable decisions regarding their products and they definitely slept over the entire internet-age.... They were pretty fast with what they offered and then the market just passed them and left them behind.

I have not looked into their newest products, but if they are solid, it is definitely a great investment for the future. BB is in business forever. But if they keep making those mistakes they used to make, it's probably a risky choice.

From the latest 10-Q filing:

\*""\****Restricted Stock Units***

*RSUs generally vest ratably over three years for awards with service condition and over two years for awards with performance or market conditions, or a combination thereof, and are settled in shares of the Company's common stock upon vesting. A summary of the RSU transactions for the six months ended July¬†3, 2020 is as follows (in millions, except per share data):""*

So what you're seeing is management taking out the RSU's given 2-3 years prior. So this ""selling"" wouldn't really disuade me.

What WOULD diusade me is the giant $2.25 B goodwill post in the latest balance sheet.

***EDIT:*** So it seems $ON has been on an [acquisition spree](https://docoh.com/company/1097864/ON/financials) since 2014 gobbling up everything with ""semi"", ""micro"" or ""antenna"" in the name. This leads me to believe that $ON is seriously compensating for something.

Hilarious jokes aside, the acquisitions seem perfectly reasonable and some downright [meme-rocket potential](https://www.onsemi.com/PowerSolutions/newsItem.do?article=3750)

So the giant goodwill-post may perhaps be OK.

You are basically talking about a pump and dump scheme that tries to pick up some extra momentum from shorts. If you can pump it to 5k you don't need shorts. Anyone trying to orchestrate the pump would be liable for market manipulation.

> GME steps up and locks in its value, preventing insolvency indefinitely. 

This was a lot of people's' plan all along. It's not a squeeze though, more like a long road to recovery. Shorts will have plenty of time to exit slowly.

> How can I buy GME without my broker turning around, lending out **my share** 

Use a cash account, idk if there is a law around it but most brokers won't lend out a share from a cash only account. You can also read your broker's ToS or just call them to ask about it.

2179,GME," In hindsight eveything seems obvious but on that Thursday when it was going up, the squeeze was almost inevitable. Being greedy would've been the correct choice. 

I said ""almost"" because there was literally only 1 thing that could stop the squeeze - illegal market manipulation fuckery on a huge scale, and they did exactly that, brokers pulled the plug and they prevented the true squeeze from starting.

Idk where you're getting DFV telling that from, he said almost nothing on wsb and most of his videos were focused more on fundamentals than squeeze play.
But still, it's true they had to cover and that would've started the squeeze if not for brokers restricting buying (AND ALLOWING SELLING) that led loss of the entire momentum that was impossible to recover because the buying restrictions were is place for quite some time.

They most likely closed their most at risk positions on Thursday/Friday (obviously not all of them, even if S3 data is correct, you can easily argue it's fishy, 50% short interest would still make GME one of the most shorted companies on the market)

Tbh I still believe a short squeeze could be possible but to begin it needs a serious fundamental catalyst, most probably some serious developments in Ryan Cohen's plans. Even if Gamestop's short interest isn't as high as it was (more than 100% is absolutely nuts and should be illegal) there is still some positivie potential for the future.",thesilentlurk3r,7,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfumng/it_still_isnt_over_part_12_the_notebook/gmoo9pg/,0.109,0.776,0.116,0.5879

2253,TLRY,"  

Degenerates. I have been on [r/weedstocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/weedstocks) for years and held/holding $APHA for years!

This will be the global leader in weed. Many Catalysts:

1. Merger w TLRY
2. U.S. weed legalization
3. U.S. weed banking reform
4. European expansion (largest and only facility in Germany!), footprint in Portugal, Malta and other countries
5. Biggest LP in Canada (highest revenues, biggest % of market share)
6. Strong management, already profitable, great execution
7. Significant arbitrage play with the merger (compared to TLRY price) - 20-25% at present

Now, $TLRY is going through a SQUEEZE. GME #2... Shorts are SCARED:

I also think you are severely undervaluing the company with US legalization on the horizon after the Georgia Runoffs and Fetterman filing his senate paperwork. He has huge PA support and is running on a very legalization heavy campaign. Considering the seats up for grabs in 2022, our current congress will most likely introduce legalization in late 2021 which will drive the price way up probably by Q1 2022. This allows states to tax and recoup some losses from Covid. It‚Äôs a bipartisan issue, and moderate republicans will support it for re-election points, so all signs point to high value in weed stocks. 

That being said, Aphria acquiring Tilray in Q2 this year will push Tilray‚Äôs value up as the largest distributor in Canada and the US, with a strong presence in Germany.

2351,SI," Your right, the SI is likely still very high even as of today. My question is this: 

There are layers of shorts, we know that. How do we know for sure that all the short sellers got margin called? Maybe some of the small players but let‚Äôs be real here, do the biggest dogs ever get out in time out? I think not. I think the smaller players, got margin called and the covering + the flood of retail and other institutional buyers wanting a piece of the pie sparked a heavy bullish frenzy that propelled the stock upwards. I just find it hard to believe that some of the biggest financial institutions in our country got margin called. And if they did and the majority of short sellers covered last week like the news is reporting, I would like to think that the stock would reach a much higher price than $500 considering the short interest was around %138. These guys do whatever they want with impunity it‚Äôs a simple as that. Why would the biggest players, who make up the majority of the short interest, cover their positions at such astronomical prices? It would result in financial ruin. It would be much smarter to use your power and influence to pull some strings here and there, talk to some brokers about ‚Äúchanging capitol requirements‚Äù have a chat with CNBC and make sure they‚Äôre reporting a truth that works on your behalf, and most importantly, manipulate the price of the stock down to a level that is more advantageous to cover at. 

They still have to cover. And while yes, the low borrowing rates suggest they are under less pressure to cover at this exact moment, they still have to cover at some point. Looking at the volume each day for last week and the acclaimed reduction in short positions, the math doesn‚Äôt add up. Short interest is likely still very high and institutional investors hold 177% of the float and nobody is selling in the vast quantities they need to cover their positions. 

Also, what about those March 19/800 calls? Sounds to me like someone is hedging against their colossal short position.",HotspurN17,123,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfpkl9/theres_a_lot_of_misinformation_about_what/gmnb78s/,0.037,0.842,0.12,0.9858

A lot of shorts were likely opened in the last week at $130 and down.... but those original shorts at $30 and below are likely still there paying the interest and waiting it out.

The stock had to maintain a price at $60 for a while but if it doubles then most shorts will be under water. They could still wait it out but this gives GME some time to fundamentally change the valuation and business model.

2354,VERY," Yeah.. I was VERY bullish on that. I mean it ran out the gate and spiked once restrictions were lifted so I thought there was still momentum.

**TL:DR** Do I still think GME could hit 150+ on Cohen? Definitely. But I'm probably not willing to wait that long when there are other hot topics.

For those that lost their savings on GME, consider buying atm leaps on actively managed ETFs with a strong history.

Something like 70% ETF (ARK, ICLN, etc.),25% meme stock and 5% FDs is a pretty good balance. The mutual funds continually give you money to gamble away on your FDs while the memestocks can still hit those 10 baggers that grow your account.

Not to mention, the absolutely terrible post yesterday that claimed 170% institutional ownership of GME, and then the most downvoted post showed the details from another Bloomberg terminal that showed that this was high because a ton of funds have yet to report their holdings which means there is double counting since a large number of pension funds most likely dumped most of their GME at record highs.

2618,RH," You're out of your mind.  You're so far up your own diamond handed ass, you can't even see that it's the inside of your colon you're looking at.  
  
You say that a conspiracy happened and is supported by data, but then you don't provide any.  
  
What conspiracy happened?  Who were the players?  Where's the proof?  Do you have internal emails?  Do you have hard numbers?  Do you have proof that, for instance, the DTC did not raise collateral requirements?  Or that they unlawfully changed the formula for calculating the collateral requirements?  
Do you have hard numbers to prove that RH, Webull, et al did in fact have the capital required to provide the collateral and chose not to?  Or that they shut down even though they had posted collateral?  
  
You aren't posting any facts; you aren't posting any data; you aren't posting any numbers.  What you are posting is a bunch of nebulus claims, that play upon people's suspicions, and you keep saying there's all this evidence but you don't provide it.  
  
Do you know where I've seen this before?  
That's right!  The 2020 election.  For months before the election, a certain group of people ramped up nebulous claims that if they lost it would be because of election fraud; that the other side was going to steal the election, just you watch.  
Direct correlation - If the SI report comes out and shows lower numbers it will be because they lied to the SEC; or it will be because they changed the formulae so it can't show higher than 100% anymore; or it will be because they hid it with counterfeit shares; or it will be because they hid it with synthetic longs.  
  
Just like with the election - you start by discrediting the source of info that is going to undermine your position, before that source of info becomes public.  You prime everyone to disbelieve information that doesn't support what they want to believe.  

After the election was over, SEE! WE TOLD YOU!  SEE!  THEY DID IT!  They stole the election!  Look at this here, this is fraud!  Look at that there, that's fraud!  We totally have evidence and it will come out!  
...and then no evidence is presented.  Vague claims of seeing something that looked suspicious, but no actual proof of anything other than something seeming suspicious to someone.  
No evidence presented in any of the lawsuits, despite the claims that they had it and it would TOTALLY come out; no evidence presented in any of the public announcements other than affidavits from rando nobodys who saw something from a distance without any knowledge of processes and made an assumption that it was fraud.  
  
Direct correlation - you, here, claiming that you have all this proof and data that supports your assumption that brokers shutting down was fraud, but then not presenting it.  You, here, claiming that every drop from the current peak is a short ladder attack, EVEN on days where the uptick rule is in place; even on days where the stock barely moved from the previous trading day's close.  
If they can move it over $300 down in a matter of a couple days with short ladder attacks, why is it they're having such a hard time moving it the last 50 back down to 10?  If anything, they'd short that shit all the motherfucking way down hoping to shake out more holdouts; after all, they're just going to keep counterfeiting shares and then moving the counterfeited shares around from one entity to another, to keep them off the FTD right?  They can keep that shit up forever.  
  
Innocent until proven guilty - you're the one making the claims of wrongdoing; prove it beyond a reasonable doubt.  
You can't.  Do you know why you can't? Because you don't know how the system works behind the scenes.  People have tried to tell you, they've tried to give you a layperson's overview, but you won't believe them because it doesn't fit your narrative.  
Just like a certain group of people who saw fraud everywhere they looked, and didn't want to believe the people who have run the system for years and know how it operates and know the things they saw weren't really anything sinister. They didn't believe the explanations they were given either.  So they ranted on and on about how they were being fucked.  
  
So let me ask you this... What's changed?  
You claim that they haven't covered their shorts.  So the setup for the squeeze is still there right?  
The brokers aren't restricting buying anymore - RH has removed their restrictions; you can buy shares and contracts now.  So have the other brokers so far as I can see.  
So people can buy to their heart's content right?  
In fact, shouldn't it be EASIER for you to force the squeeze now since y'all claim that the massive drop from the $300s all the way down was more shorting?  More shorting should make it even easier for y'all to buy up whatever's left and squeeze them all lifeless.  

So... what, precisely, was stopping y'all from buying it all up again today and driving it up again?  Shouldn't you have been able to drive it pretty much back up to $400 again?  The shorts didn't go away, and y'all keep claiming that the volume doesn't support them covering their lower price deep in the red shorts, so all you should have to do is what you did on the 26th and 27th and drive it back up to $200, $300, $400 and the squeeze should be on again - you'd be right back to where the shorts are DEEP in the red and facing margin calls.  
So why the fuck is it that, with 25.5m volume (low for lately, but 3x what the volume was on most random average days back in oct, nov, dec) today, other than the premarket runup and subsequent opening drop; it traded nearly fucking flat all. day. long. and even in aftermarket remained fucking flat?

2670,RH," Honestly - I'm going with the narrative that the (in my opinion pumpers) have been throwing out.  I can't count the number of times I've seen posts claiming that all the gain porn posted, all the posts saying someone sold, are all HF shills or bots and nobody's selling.  
  
So if I'm to take the arguments that keep getting thrown around on here at face value, then:  
-The shorts haven't covered.  
-The shorts haven't covered old positions and re-opened new positions at higher price points that make a squeeze unlikely or impossible.  
-Nobody's selling.  
-Everyone's diamond handing and any narrative to the contrary is lies and slander.  
  
If that's all true, then there is literally no reason this hasn't blown up yet given that the brokers all (or nearly all) are back to no restrictions.  Robinhood lifted the last of their restrictions last Friday I believe, sometime mid day IIRC - they started at 500 shares and sometime mid day removed them all (or maybe it was Thurs they removed them all, but I know they were all removed before open today).  
Yet, Friday we only closed at $63.xx roughly $14 higher than Thursday's $49 close with the uptick rule in place and very low or no restrictions on buying, and Today closed at $60, $3 lower than Friday's close - without the uptick rule being in place and no restrictions on buying.  
  
The only thing that would account for this is that something in the narrative being posted here is untrue.  People have sold, or are selling and that would undermine the squeeze, which would undermine the current holders' ability to make a profit as current holders would realize this is a game of get out before everyone else or lose money, or;  
  
shorts have covered and reopened shorts at much higher price points and are not feeling any pain nor any pressure to cover, which would also undermine a squeeze as current holders would face a much longer hill to climb to get the price up to where a squeeze would occur and might lose faith and start selling which feeds into the previous point, or;  
  
Shorts have covered entirely (or significantly) which would make a squeeze not possible, which would then result in anyone who doesn't believe the stock is worth its current value (and won't be for at least the next few years) selling and the stock dropping, thereby reducing the value of holders' shares.  
  
As for just sheer momentum, why wouldn't that momentum come back?  If you're a holder and you really believe that a squeeze is possible and possible at the same levels as before, and the restrictions are gone now, and nobody's really selling... why wouldn't you jump right back in the same as before?  Nothing has changed, so you should be right back to just as pumped.  
Best case, you go to the moon  
Worst case, you can only drive it back up as far as before and RH and others block buying again but this time you can sell at $400 and if you've bought at a reasonable price you'll make a decent amount of money.  In fact $300 calls are around $1.50 and $200 calls are around $2.25 so you could snatch up a couple $200 calls or $300 calls for a few hundred total and trigger MMs to have to buy hundreds of shares helping the squeeze - and then you could be getting those calls back up to over $100, which would get you 10s of thousands in profit for little risk.  
  
Something with the narrative being pushed doesn't add up with the reality playing out.  
Edit: To expand on this just a little more - if the purchasing power of retail is gone because so many have already spent their money and have nothing left in the tank, then 1 - the squeeze is no longer possible because the retail that is going to get into it doesn't have enough money to get it back up to the right levels, and the narrative that a squeeze is still going to happen is totally and utterly bupkis, and also possibly 2 - if the previous peak wasn't even the start of the squeeze (as has also been claimed) the squeeze would never have happened, because buying restrictions or not, if the money has been spent it's been spent and if people don't have the money to buy now @ $60 they certainly wouldn't have had the money to keep buying at over $400.",budlightguy,4,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfpzz9/qanongme_comparisons_and_how_we_learned_to_love/gmobbrs/,0.064,0.86,0.076,0.8583

2672,IMO," No problem at all! Thank you for taking the time to read it and respond. I also appreciate your tireless search for the truth and I do support the transparency and availability of what‚Äôs actually going on to everyone. I also believe that we are all adults and can be trusted with that information. 

Labels make it easier to dismiss information we might not agree with, but, for clarification, I don‚Äôt classify what I wrote as post-modern. Sure, that sentence you‚Äôve quoted, out of context, is. The point of my original comment and that I hope to emphasize here is that: The more we box ourselves into a certain perspective, the less malleable we are when faced with change. The ability to change our perspective combined with the power of simple patience for each other will allow us to break down artificial labels that prevent us from exchanging information we can both benefit from. 

Saying you are pro-WSB, but you aren‚Äôt QAnon or whatever permutation of that you choose causes labeling to occur. Labeling and classification of people based on small bits of information is exactly what ‚ÄúUnited we stand, divided we fall‚Äù foretells. Either we are on the same page, which IMO should be to become the best versions of ourselves and share information freely, or we find some equally compelling reason to see that we are all actually working together.

2680,GME," It‚Äôs a by-product of how the market works. When you buy a stock and it shows up in your account, it‚Äôs not really yours yet. It takes two days to settle a stock trade, which means verifying the seller had the stock to sell, the buyer has the agreed upon price, etc. The brokerages/clearinghouses make this seem instantaneous to you by putting the stock in your account until the transaction clears. The way the clearinghouse does this is acts as the opposite side of whatever the trade is. Let‚Äôs say I‚Äôm selling you 1 share of GME. I‚Äôm the seller, you‚Äôre the buyer. To me, the clearinghouse is the  buyer, to you it is the seller. So what happens if I sell you a share, but don‚Äôt deliver? The clearinghouse takes on that risk (i.e., you get the share, the clearinghouse has to find a share). Similarly, if you don‚Äôt pay, I still get my money, but the clearinghouse eats the cost. 

Now the clearinghouse obviously doesn‚Äôt want either of these events to happen and what‚Äôs more, it doesn‚Äôt deal directly with you or me: it deals with our brokers. So it pushes the risk for the transaction onto the brokers. Basically they do this with very short term loans backed by cash collateral. If our transaction works as expected, with both of us honest, the brokers get their collateral back. If one of us reneges, the our broker takes the hit. Most of the time, it‚Äôs not necessary to need more than a small percentage of the trades as collateral. However, sometimes there is a particular security that becomes riskier, so the clearinghouse requires more collateral for that security. This is what happened to Robinhood (and others) they simply were running out of the required amount of collateral to facilitate the trade and thus Robinhood (and others) had to limit the number of trades they could allow for the security (and it turns out that buying is the side where the risk is). 

This is similar to a broker raising the percentage of a security that must be bought with cash (vs margin). My broker was requiring that GME be 100% cash secured. I‚Äôm not sure, but I thought I saw on here that Robinhood had it only at 75% (meaning that for 1 share of GME you could spend 75% of the cost using cash and the remaining 25% using margin). If that‚Äôs true, chalk that up as another instance of Robinhood having shit risk management. 

Now, for a Qanon comparison. After the election, it was found that dead people voted in the election. That sounds sketchy as fuck, right? Except it turns out that in almost every case there was a perfectly mundane explanation. For example, a person voted early (or by mail) and died afterwards. Or a person with the same name voted. 

It‚Äôs easy to frame it as a big conspiracy, but when you dig deeper, it‚Äôs just something you would expect to happen (especially if we are talking about millions of events (votes/trading shares) happening in rapid succession.",SportTheFoole,8,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfpzz9/qanongme_comparisons_and_how_we_learned_to_love/gmntsq9/,0.077,0.826,0.097,0.6561

Because if any of the above is true, I implore you to contact the attorneys handling the lawsuits over the stopping of the trades - if you actually witnessed these things, then I want you to believe them and I want you to expose them.

You may be right - there may be some wrongdoing behind the scenes - and I'm sure there is some wrongdoing somewhere.  
However, that is not proof.  
The fact that there is provable wrongdoing in the past, in different circumstances, is not proof of the current claims.  It may very well be reasonable suspicion.  It is not proof.  
  
A reasonable and, by everything I've been able to find from looking through the regulations online, technically accurate explanation has been given for why buying was halted.  What happened fits the explanation given of how the collateral requirements work.

Now.  If evidence comes out through discovery in the lawsuits that proves you all right, I will be more than happy to admit I was wrong.

So you think it was just a coincidence?

Like, several of most well-capitalized hedge funds in the world *just happened* to save tens of billions of $$$ due to a coincidence?

Is that honestly what you think?

The proof you are asking for might exist (or might not) but it takes time (and money and prosecutors) to obtain.

In the meantime, all we can do is look at the outcome:

hedge funds saved BILLIONS of dollars (and probably their existence) because retailers were not allowed to trade for several days. That is both unprecedented and extremely unfair.

Okay. We both know that.

Now you say that you require official documents to believe this was done to intentionally to save the hedge funds? And in the absence of said evidence you will believe that this was the operation of normal market mechanisms? (I do wonder I why you're okay making one firm conclusion without said data but not another).

Others say the data that hedge funds were saved was enough to point to collusion (I mean they got the exact outcome they desperately needed!), and then point to key financial relationships between the two groups as further supporting evidence.",darkside_of_the_tomb,0,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfpzz9/qanongme_comparisons_and_how_we_learned_to_love/gmnnxym/,0.034,0.847,0.119,0.957

So I started looking, and from what I can find, yes the reasoning for why buying was shut down but not selling makes sense - when you're selling, the DTC is sending money to you on behalf of the buyer - it's the buyer on the other side that now owes the DTC so ~~the collateral required for you to sell would be from the other side~~ edit: this was worded poorly: it should read there is no collateral required for you to sell, because they're not paying out money on your behalf. /end edit  - the collateral is required from the buyer's broker, not the seller's broker.  And yes, the regulations DO prevent the buyer's broker from using customer funds to pay their collateral requirements because the collateral isn't payment for the trades; the collateral is a business expense of the broker that they will get some of back if the collateral goes down or pay more in if it goes up.  The payment for trades happens independently of that.  They are required to only use customer funds for payment of the customer's trades (or payment for margin or other fees the broker charges the customer).  

The reason for shutting down buying - well the collateral went up to more than 3x - from 30% to 100%, because of the risk of having everything concentrated into a few stocks and the insane volatility.  Why didn't RH just say so?  Because they're looking to IPO soon.  Ask anyone who's been involved in IPOs - when you're about to IPO you DO NOT go on national TV and admit that you've got liquidity issues that prevented you from serving your customers, not even if it was an extreme edge case.  You don't lie about it, but you don't admit it either.  You dance around it, you double speak and weasel word your way around it.  And that's exactly what Vlad did.

If they can just do it forever, then how the fuck are you ever going to have a short squeeze?

2711,SHO," here is the answer:

**How Margin accounts help shorters:**

If shares are in a margin account, they may be loaned to a short without the consent or knowledge of the account owner. If the shares are in a cash account, IRA account or are restricted shares they are not supposed to be borrowed unless there is express consent by the account owner.

Margin account buyers, because of loopholes in the rules, inadvertently aid the shorts. If short A sells a naked short he has three days to deliver a borrowed share. If the counterfeit share is purchased in a margin account, it is immediately put into the stock lend and, for a fee, is available as a borrowed share to the short who counterfeited it in the first place. This process is perpetually fluid with multiple parties, but it serves to create more counterfeit shares and is an example of how a counterfeit share gets ‚Äúlaundered‚Äù into a legitimate borrowed share.

Margin account agreements give the broker dealers the right to lend those shares without notifying the account owner. Shares held in cash accounts, IRA accounts and any restricted shares are not supposed to be loaned without express consent from the account owner. Broker dealers have been known to change cash accounts to margin accounts without telling the owner, take shares from IRA accounts, take shares from cash accounts and lend restricted shares. One of the prime brokers recently took a million shares from cash accounts of the company's founding investors without telling the owners or the stockbroker who represented ownership. The shares were put into the stock lend, which got the company off the SHO threshold list, and opened the door for more manipulative shorting.

2734,PM," That‚Äôs kinda tough bc I have a masters in finance, so I know a lot of the basics. I would stay away from popular YouTubers, I‚Äôve tried to find videos for my friends and a lot of them are either seriously misinformed or just lying/drawing out the videos for ad revenue. 


A lot of professors record their lessons and post them though, although it kinda depends on your level of calculus as to how far you‚Äôll understand options in a theoretical sense. 


Otherwise this sub (pre and hopefully post Gme) is a great resource to see theory in action. A lot of OGs are people actually in finance like me who know what they‚Äôre doing. Idk if it‚Äôs possible but if you can review posts from March 2020 to November 2020 there‚Äôs some great content, also the FAQ.

And this is probably the entire issue. People were transferring money into their RH accounts and getting $1000 to spend while they waited for the transfer to go through. Sound to me like RH was buying these stocks on margin and just failed to make that clear to people waiting for their money to transfer.

In other words, when RH was loaning people that up to $1000 till the transfer cleared, what they were really doing was giving you $1000 worth of margin.

I have been able to average down and out of EVERY trade I've been in that went south. I lost 50 bucks on one that i averaged down and out of but all others i broke even or made like a few dollars. I have regretted getting out of some of those trades though. Specifically GEVO and one I can't outright mention cause the market cap is too low for WSB so i'll write like so... first lettter J and second letter E in September.

Shares are good. Leaps might be even better.

If you dunno what a Leap is, no problem. It's a call, but for a longer period of time. MMs will make new strike prices for CLNE soon that go up higher. I would probably buy at least 3 months out on this, maybe up to 6.

So a possible position could be like CLNE $20 or $25 or hell maybe even $30 Call for August 2021. If you're feel real good about this, go to January 2022. Having one leap is like reaping the gains from 100 shares. So it's a way to get more bang for your buck if CLNE ends up going wild all year.

2912,ICE," I agree, zero emissions by 2050 isn't possible to achieve in 4 years, that's pure math. But you'd have to take into consideration that those vehicle types have longer than typical lifespans. Imagine buying a jet aircraft, building out the CNG infrastructure at all airports you service, only for a cheaper electric (or zero emission, could be dilithium crystals afaik) alternative to exist by the time your business should be ""net zero"". Rather, it's more cost effective to buy the standard jet engine for now and invest in the development of a zero emission model.

You also have to consider states like California where there is going to be a ban on the sale of new ICE vehicles much sooner. CNG falls under that category. Yes, you can go out of state to purchase them, but not many will go through the hassle of doing so. It doesn't make sense to build out core infrastructure with built-in obsolescence well before the infrastructure pays for itself.",sirgentrification,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lflzaq/clne_dd_the_path_of_least_resistance_and_most/gmmuvnc/,0.014,0.925,0.062,0.7086

2961,TLRY," Isn‚Äôt ownership based on %age of shares outstanding owned? That can‚Äôt change since it‚Äôs a straight share for share acquisition. So aphria has to end up owning 62% of a company that is worth the combined value of both companies right now. 

I understand the ratio is fixed and that is part of the deal terms, but the ownership %age is also fixed because the deal terms are in shares. 

I think multiplying TLRY share price by the ratio is creating value out of thin air. Aphria isn‚Äôt worth 0.8381 times TLRY. Aphria is worth 62% of the combined company. 0.8381 shares of Tilray per share of aphria is just how they end up with 62% of the shares outstanding of the whole.",sydaust,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lg9ktu/some_dd_on_tlryapha_since_none_of_you_seem_to_get/gmqk1io/,0.0,0.708,0.292,0.9882

3062,DIS," Thanks for the thoughtful reply, and I do agree that ""as-is"" DIS will trade at a blended multiple for some time.   

That said, the dtc business will unlock higher growth (particularly in AsiaPac) *and* higher margins for the entire company.

They have many markets to expand from too, since they are primarily based in China. They are also expanding their chemical engineers team as seen on LinkedIn.

Kate Wang is the current CEO and she used to be the Chinese head for Didi(Uber in China).

The premium your paying is worth it because you're technically owning 100s of shares of that stock for much less capital. And ITM is safer because you won't lose the intrinsic value of the option (as long as it doesn't expire out the money)

3199,HE," I used to watch The Daily Show every single day before going to bed.  Jon Stewart is brilliant and did TONS to bring light to this sort of nonsense.  Not only did HE do it but he basically created Stephen Colbert and the stuff Stephen did to expose the corruption and utter ridiculousness of Super PACs was outstanding.

Can you imagine being Jon Stewart today though?  Looking back...  did he make a lick of difference in the world?  All of the great work he did...  did any of it matter?

Look at characters like Jim Cramer and Tucker Carlson, who Jon absolutely eviscerated.  Where are they today?  Banished into obscurity?   Well...  no...  they're worse than they've ever been and still going strong.

I feel bad for Jon Stewart.  I really do.  The people that needed to hear what he had to say never listened to a single word.

I wish he'd run for office, but I fear he just doesn't have the fight left in him and I can't blame him at all.

3368,FB," I was in the industry for a long while.  FB dating debut creating a fear response to investors in other brands thinking FB would crush them. Retards didn't understand the space at all.  Few notes

- Research suggested a low % (less than half) would ever consider binding their private life with their dating life citing privacy concerns and a need for a more compartmentalized approach to dating
- Entry of a new competitor is a rising tide that floats all ships; very few people stick with one application in online dating; norm is 2.5-3 applications per user; users want to maximize their odds in different user pools; Facebook users trying their dating platform will naturally bleed over to other services and will include people that would have otherwise not given online dating a chance
- covid actually was a boon to online dating as bars, restaurants, and other venues to meet singles were shuttered
- product and inventory are the people; needs solid growth in MAU which eventually covert to paying members (typically 1-3% for subscriptions and higher for microtransactions to contribute to ARPU / LTV)

3376,MTCH," I'd treat this the same way as a mobile gaming company. If they have enough ""whales"" and can consistently acquire more while lowering the cost of acquisition there is a potential for growth here. But most people don't pay for their service so they depend on substituting that with ad revenue and god knows what data they sell.

If you look at their primary competitor MTCH (Match Group) their growth has gone through the roof due to COVID. When COVID does die down many people will go back to just meeting people in the real world. At that point don't expect as much user volume or growth as seen for the past year. 

Honestly I'd wait for the initial IPO run up then buy puts on the dating app industry as a whole. It'll definitely cool down as things open back up. The growth Match Group and Bumble are going to show for the past year isn't sustainable.

Hell, I'm tired of blowing chunks while holding on to this thing.

Example: Buy in the low $6s in 2013.  Moons to $16.15 on March 3, 2014.  Dumps back into single digits for years.  Moons again to $13.95 on November 27, 2017.   Drops into the $3s in 2018.  Trades sideways until about October 2020, with a nice visit to $1.73 on March 19, 2020 (less than a year ago!).  Ugh.  


I wasn't shaken out (yes, I did indeed diamond-hand it), but a LOT of people were.    


So - I feel some long old-timers will sell, and we'll see some dips and swings.  


This has been the nature of Himax, and will probably continue to be so for a while to come.  


On a positive note - there's tendies to be had from trading it.",mountainoftea,7,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfm7yz/himx_the_tendies_were_nice_today_february_8_2021/gmn4iuy/,0.072,0.88,0.048,-0.2455

3420,AMD," Himax came on my radar back in 2013.  

&#x200B;

\[It came onto the radar of a lot of people for their association with Google, and specifically with Google Glass (Himax provided the LCoS display). \]

&#x200B;

When it came onto my radar, it intrigued me due to an article written by Mark Gomes.  He mentioned about 1500 patents.

&#x200B;

I am a self-described Autist who likes to read patent info.

&#x200B;

So, back then - I did:

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\[I still continue to read patent stuff.\]

&#x200B;

The thing that got me about Himax was not only its patent portfolio, but its debt - or should I say, their lack thereof.

&#x200B;

It looked pretty tasty, so I pulled the trigger.  

&#x200B;

I bought in around $6, several months later I could have sold for $15-16 and I didn't.  

&#x200B;

I held.

&#x200B;

That holding was a mistake on my part, as it has been a roller-coaster ride.  

&#x200B;

That said - they are now firing on all cylinders, and the rest of the tech world is now starting to catch up to a lot of their patents and will be using them.  

&#x200B;

Interestingly, I feel their LCoS technology will shine not as AR headset material, but in use for sensors - specifically as automotive LiDAR systems:

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Contrary to Elon's feelings that ""LiDAR is a fool's errand,‚Äù I feel it will be one of many technologies which will be used in the automotive (and commercial trucking) industries in the coming years.  

&#x200B;

Lumotive is a privately held company backed by Bill Gates, and shares of Himax will be a great way to get exposure to their offerings.

&#x200B;

Extra Special Bonus - Himax's bread-and-butter for years has been creating ICs for flat panel displays.  As those panels are now going to be ubiquitous in vehicles, the demand for this tech is booming (they were planning to eventually transition away from this as their primary business; good thing they haven't, yet) and they are gonna make some serious bank on this.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

TL;DR:

&#x200B;

 \-  Long term, I see this doing an AMD, possibly getting anywhere from $60-100 within 3 years.  Not steady however; there will be opportunities to trade in and out of it, so if you miss this run up, don't worry - there will be others.

&#x200B;

 \- I may certainly exit before earnings in May 2021.  Historically, it goes down after the conference call, even when they've had blow out numbers.  

&#x200B;

If they pre-announce in March (they probably will), and the earnings are really, really good, I may sell a chunk at that juncture and then put some back in later in the year.  I've held this for 8 years (and added to it over time), and I'm wanting to explore some other stuff that's out there with some of my Himax play money.
