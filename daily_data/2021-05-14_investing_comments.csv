0,IMO," I know I will get downvotes. But...

Look at the R&D spent. 100% up from last year. They *doubled* their R&D spend and still were able to beat earnings. That's the story apparently no one cares about. The Bitcoin sale is pure noise IMO. The vast majority of money made was spent to expand the company's production capacity.

[Capital investment to build a new Tesla factory is roughly $1B now. The total 12-month revenue that comes from a full production factory is $2.5B (250K cars/year). In other words for every $1 investment into a new factory, the company will generate $2.5/yr in revenue.](https://ritholtz.com/2021/01/transcript-ron-baron/) From 2022 to 2025 expect massive growth in the company's revenue. Which they in turn can spend right back into more expansion if needed.

1,UK," I know that I am just a guy on the internet but this is my take:

Tesla will become a mid sized US car manufacturer similar in size and function to Jaguar or Range Rover in the UK. Funny enough both of these brands are owned by the same company, Tata Motors. 

Tesla does have a brand that people like to buy into but they won't match the quantity of vehicles sold by Toyota, Honda, or VW for a couple reasons:

1) Making that many cars takes a lot of ramp up time. This is obvious, cars are intrinsically difficult to make and source parts for and this takes time. 

2) Doing this would destroy their brand. Right now Tesla is seen as a luxury or luxury-lite brand. If they produce too many cars a year they will lose that perception and have to compete on function with other (likely better) car manufacturers. 

Tesla's numbers are currently comparable to Jaguar and Range Rover. Both of those brands also have an exclusivity around them that if they sell to many vehicles by lowering prices and luxury amenities they will lose. Being Jaguar or Range Rover is not bad both companies do well especially in good markets where people are willing to buy their cars for the status symbol they are. 

Valuing Tesla higher than all other automotive companies combined is clearly unrealistic.",PuffyPanda200,27,/r/investing/comments/ncc7gx/23_of_teslas_q1_earnings_were_from_bitcoin/gy49vfp/,0.07,0.833,0.097,0.781
2,AI," Sigh. Okay... 

1. There were several short-term tailwinds in this earnings report.
2. There were also several short-term headwinds.
3. There are massive long-term tailwinds.

Short-term Tailwinds:
1. Carbon Credits - These will decline over time. But have been super helpful.
2. Crypto Sale - They sold 10% of their Bitcoin, this won't continue. And isn't a major factor in Tesla's real long-term success.

Headwinds:
1. Refreshed high margin Model S&X not yet being released. These are starting in June - will help this quarter a bit and next quarter a ton.
2. Elon's huge compensation package. Most of this has been paid out now and the rest will be spread over the coming several years.
3. Chip and material shortages thanks to the pandemic.

Galloway sounds smart, but was suggesting you sell Tesla stock when it was at about $50 per share split-adjusted (as were most people in this sub btw). He later admitted he was wrong. He is so surface level on Tesla that it is a joke to anyone who follows the company closely. Great clickbait though!

If you want something real to worry about Tesla, it is the delays with self-driving and 4680 battery cells. They will get through these delays over time - but it is the thing that people who actually know what they are talking about with Tesla are following closely. If you don't know that - you don't know that much about Tesla. That's okay, you can learn.

Tesla's are the best vehicles in the world in almost every way. They have a massive lead in self-driving (their fleet already has the hardware - it just needs to wake up). They have the most efficient vehicles, the best entertainment features, the best performance, the lowest battery costs, the best engineers in the world, the fastest pace of innovation, the best cost efficiency. They make the profits that would otherwise go to the dealership and the profits from charging. Pair that with having the lowest production cost and you can see just part of their incredible lead. How about not having to pay for advertising? How about having a CEO with over 50 million Twitter followers? How about having a loyal cult following promoting your products? How about having the most convenient charging? I could go on.

Tesla will be the global leader in transportation, energy, and maybe even AI. It will be the biggest company the world has ever seen.

Let's take VAG for example. Their MEB platform will see 12 cars across their brands until 2023. Four of them are already in production. 

Now take your average car driver. He wants a car that gets him from A to B, has okay features, is reliable, easy to service and from a brand he knows (look at the abysmal sales of Lexus/Infinity in Europe, for example). He doesn't want an electric car, he wants a car that happens to be electric. 

And here the established manufacturers have a huuuuge advantage. Their EV platforms are very close now, but they have the advantage of established QA, an established dealer network, good parts availability and so on. That's something which is extremely costly and difficult to establish. You can't step up QA overnight while fulfilling more and more orders. It takes money and time. 

That's not an attack on Tesla, don't get me wrong. But they appeal to **very** different buyers at the moment. An average person doesn't care that their car can go from 0-100 in under 4 seconds, they don't care that Tesla has the coolest tech, and so on. The customer base that Tesla appeals to, the sort of adventurous, interested in bleeding edge tech, person is not the majority. 


I don't think they will somehow vanish or go under, not at all. But I am very sure that Tesla will not be the largest car manufacturer or massively beat VAG/Toyota/PSA/Renault.

When talking about the average consumer, they don't care what phone they have. They want it to look good, have nice build quality. It should work well and for some people carry prestige.

Don't get me wrong I hate tesla's approach. Like summon is still terrible, navigate on autopilot is awesome kind of wonky but having all of this be separate is so weird and confusing. However the regular autopilot that comes with the car is amazing, stops behind other cars even at stop lights (as long as you are behind another car). It works on literally any street with lane markings, while it looks like the supercruise is a hardcoded path for major highways which is impossible to scale.

49,ETH," > because it slows the supply, making price move up, making more miners want to mine, further securing the network

Indirectly can have an effect on some of those, but mainly it's just keeping the block reward supply constant. The coins have set expected block times they try to maintain, so the constant difficulty increases / decreases based off how many are mining are just a means to try and keep that expected time consistent. I think BTC was 10 minute expected block time, while ETH is like 10 seconds.

Tesla's claim of wanting to take payment from coins with less energy consumption is noble if they do in fact select coins that aren't mineable... But if they just pick another Proof of Work coin (mineable), then they're full of shit. I saw some infographics floating around Twitter listing how much elec is consumed per transaction for various coins, and all those figures are pointless because once a lesser coin becomes the ""new"" most profitable coin to mine the elec costs jump as miners flock to it. BTC wastes so much energy because so many are trying mining it, not because it's designed to waste all that energy (well I guess technically it is designed that way due to difficulty adjusting ha).

As for Nodes, yup. They're securing the network by validating and keeping up to date list of all transactions.

Whose not taking a turndown service, free towels/toiletries, privacy/security, etc for less money.... The sharing economy is such a sketchy business model long term. 

Relying on the fact that your employees have to own and maintain the assets and the fact that you don’t have any ownership to anything is kind of insane. Being able to leverage some of your assets in bad times gets a lot of companies through tough times. Not to mention, I know a couple of people who own multiple AirBnB properties and let’s just say they have those properties financed to the max, what happens when all these AirBnB owners have to renew 5-8+ mortgages and interest rates are going way up? I’m taking a hard pass on the sharing economy if the gold standard Uber can’t make money, then I doubt others will be able to.

15-20% of this country has a household income of $150,000 or more per year. They are targeting this crowd that has disposable income, it isn't advertised towards people in high school or college and it isn't trying to nab people with tight finances.

I bought XOM specifically because they weren't talking green the way the other oil companies were.  I want an oil company focused on oil and not the Beyond Petroleum nonsense. 

The world is much bigger than the US and EU.  developing nations will continue to increase their demand for oil.  Trucks, planes, trains, and ships aren't going to be powered by batteries,  neither are the big earth movers,  construction vehicles or tractors (although the mining companies are investigating electric earth movers because they run in a loop ?).  Anyway,  oil isn't going see a meaningful drop in demand for the foreseeable future. 

I seriously really respect the people who refuse to buy the stock because they think oil is icky.   I'll take it and enjoy the dividends and continued profits from building a better life for the folks that don't yet live in a first world country.

So yeah, I don't think XOM has been doing too hot for quite a while now. And I don't think things are going to get any better for oil over the next 5 years.

Exxon isn't doing this. That's going to be an economic decision. The greener transition à la BP, Shell, Equinor/Statoil, etc. is hardly unusual for Big Oil anymore. These companies do plenty of their own projections for the future - just look at BP's Energy Outlook documents. 

The fact that Exxon has decided not to do the green thing now will be based on their assessment of their own economics. Yeah, individual board members will have their own agendas, but in the whole the company succeeding, at least short/medium term, is good for them.

I can only disagree. O&G is going to transition faster than people anticipate because the economics are against them (along with a bunch of other things being against them). The transition will be continuous and painful for decades. Like the last decade that US coal companies had.

186,NEE," >	You're gonna have to be more specific than ""energy"" hasn't been a good return.

Energy, as a sector, made up 14% of the S&P 30 years ago, 20 years ago that share shrunk to 7%, 10 years ago it was at 11%(due to tech's weaker valuation).  Currently it sits at UNDER 2% of the S&P.

Like, if you want to get argumentative then you're picking the wrong hill to die on.  The math here is super simple, the entire energy sector has gone from accounting for 10-15% of the market to having a lower weight than each of the six largest individual companies in the index.  That's a very decisive indicator of sector wide weakness.  Any attempt to paint the sector as anything other than a significant underperforming investment is laughable.  

Like yeah, in any underperforming sector one can cherry pick a winner or two, this is not indicative of sector wide strength.  Also, two of the companies you listed aren't even in the energy sector, one isn't American.  NEE is a utility.

So you finally get around to answering the question. You are defining energy as it is defined by stock sector. 

Utilities engage in renewable energy production, infrastructure, the buying and selling of clean energy. It's relevant. Tesla is classified as automotive, and falls under industrials. But it's not, it's a tech and renewable play. All those companies are renewables plays, it's not relevant if they are US or overseas. 

Btw. Your ""math"" argument doesn't hold up. 

Say the ""energy"" sector was broadly 99% fossil fuels 20 years ago, and the value of the sector was 100. 1% was renewable. Fossil fuels value declined by 50%, renewables value increased by 100%. 

Total sector now = 99\*0.5+1\*2 = 51.5. The entire sector is smaller, but renewable in the sector is bigger. Math. 

If you look at the renewable ETFs, like TAN, you can see the returns transition. It would have been far better to hold TAN for the last 9 years than O&G (Although, speaking of cherry picks, TAN would be a narrow slice). 

>I don't think anyone's arguing otherwise, this doesn't make them a good investment. This is a really strange hill to try and die on lol.

Hello!

* I'm saving for retirement / long term goals
* I don't need a large amount of liquid money any time soon
* I am fairly risk-intolerant, in general
* No large debts or expenses


I am a financially illiterate ex-palantir employee and have the opportunity to buy options at \~$6 (not a crazy amount of options, but enough that it's worth figuring out).


However, when I planned for this, I didn't realize that you have to pay taxes up front. With the ability to buy \~10k options, it would cost me about $90k-$110k depending on the stock price when I buy.  I do have about double this amount invested through an online investment service ($180k). Would it be unwise to pull out half of my invested money in order to buy all these options?


I'm worried because I know you're supposed to ""diversify your holdings"", so it doesn't make sense to have half of my money tied up in palantir. On the other hand, PLTR is sitting at about $18....which is a lot more than $6....so it doesn't make sense NOT to buy them.


The reason I don't want to just buy and sell immediately, is because I've heard that you're supposed to hold stocks long term so that you pay less taxes.Does anyone have advice for me on what percentage of my ""investing money"" it makes sense to use, in order to buy just one stock, given that I can buy it ""for cheap""?

Being rational and all I of course bet on the wrong horse and I'm coming out on the wrong side of the things.

Yet still, the rational me keeps saying ""this can not go on forever"". In essence, cheap money and sovereign debt around the world make it look like everything is ok.

Nothing could be further from the truth.

Even Germany went from 60% debt/GDP to around 75%. The 2020 deficit by EU member state is astronomical: https://www.euronews.com/2021/04/22/euro-area-debt-soars-to-98-of-gdp-amid-covid-19-crisis-says-eurostat

interestingly, from the countries I know upclose, those with the biggest deficit are experiencing the biggest property price hikes. That can not be a coincidence, is it? Free cash along with the illusion that everything is fine due to country pushing social transfers into the market is creating the fantasyland.

How does this play out? The cheap interest rates will not be there forever. Sovereign debt will need to be repaid. So what's next? Higher taxes? Decrease of social security? Housing market crash when reality hits?

Or will the economy just swallow this like nothing happened? I don't want to predict the future as it turns out i'm frequently wrong. Then again, at some point, reality does hit back, like it did in 2008.

I have no clue what to do to at least protect what I have. I ""lost"" big time relative to property price hike and i'm afraid of it as hell as I have no clue if I'm going to be able to afford a decent living going forward. Yeah, I did not see property prices exploding amid pandemic, my bad, right?",rational_loser,4,/r/investing/comments/nc43p7/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/gy2z8v8/,0.109,0.755,0.137,0.77

210,RH," >  Half of economy closed or severely impacted, yet, markets have the best time ever. 

Companies like Walmart and Target remained open while many independents did not. Restaurant chains with drive throughs remained open and did well, independent chains did not and there were discussions on conference calls by chains about picking up new locations where restaurants had closed. Independents that pivoted online benefited Shopify, Facebook and others. Many corporations did good or great throughout this. 

Unfortunately, a lot of people and some industries were very impacted by this (I don't think half the economy was closed or impacted), but a lot of people acted as if they didn't care during this (Spring of last year there were full resorts in some areas.) I thought early on that people would be understandably concerned and reluctant to spend in March but that ultimately, the investments I made in March would do well over a couple of years.

By early Spring with RV dealers having record sales, Williams Sonoma having positive comps despite their stores all being closed and things like Home Depot having very strong comps, it was clear that people were still very much going to spend but simply re-directed that spending to home instead of spending on clothes and travel.  A lot of moving going on as people moved out of cities resulted in spending on home. Pool corp had a huge backlog as people were putting in pools. Polaris went from shutting down their factories to having difficulty keeping up with orders not long after. RH stock is up what, about 320% in the last year?

The pandemic is still absolutely a crisis, still having an impact but I think there was this view in March of last year that things would shut down completely. People on here in the initial bounce were saying, ""just you wait, Q1 earnings and the market is going to crater!"" Well, Q1 earnings were mostly not bad. Q2 earnings were a bit better.  Many companies have been telling people for a year now that things are going good or great. In the last quarter or two, impacted industries have started to talk about things gradually getting better.

"" I don't want to predict the future as it turns out i'm frequently wrong. ""

Then don't. It's a lot easier to have a balanced, reasonably realistic long-term view and not try to continually apply one's macro view. In Spring of last year there was tremendous frustration that the market was rebounding on here - ""it's not doing what I think it should!"" The sort of ""pessimistic, market crash potentially around every corner"" view keeps people out of the market when it's doing well and often too concerned when things actually do go South to take advantage.",dvdmovie1,4,/r/investing/comments/nc43p7/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/gy30mt5/,0.069,0.81,0.121,0.9794

213,JP, I think it could be because lock up but also because sometimes price set before IPO comes out is inaccurate and Price can be much higher than expected. For example a listed IPO is 5$ you buy before it drops but you actually end up getting it for 10-15$. This happens when large institutions like JP Morgan or other investment companies agree to buy x amount of shares from company to sell for them as middleman. But basically you will risk buying at higher price than what is listed when market opens since you are placing order before market opens.,Kevbotsmooth,1,/r/investing/comments/nc43p7/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/gy3etzg/,0.025,0.858,0.117,0.8735

My FA put me in BND and I'm not all that happy about it. It's been a dead weight since 1/1/21. But I'm looking at retirement in a matter of weeks now, so my outlook is a bit different. As you age out you can slide that bond/equity line in your pie chart around a bit. CW said 70/30 to 60/40 as you near retirement, but that may be changing.

Why do you think REITs are immune to a market crash?  It was kind of unusual that the 2000 bear coincided with a pretty big run up in real estate that didn't end until the next bear cycle.  in 2008 real estate speculation was a major reason for the crash.  I don't think it is a bad idea to have some dividend payers if that is what you want, but the only way to diversify into real estate is to own it yourself, IMO.
