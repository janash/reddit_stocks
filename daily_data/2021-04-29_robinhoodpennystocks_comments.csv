2,TXMD," In some cases, the stock is just a fund that owns predictable bonds or other assets which will never change in value. Like FLRN which just holds which is basically equivalent to a floating rate note which is barely fluctuates in price. The share price will always reflect the value of the underlying assets which in some cases, will never change unless the $ becomes worthless and therefore if you buy them, you‚Äôre basically buying something that everyone in the market knows the value of 1 year from now. 

In the case of TXMD, seems like it‚Äôs just low volume as a percentage of shares outstanding. Also, gotta remember that when a share is only $1, that means a penny is 1% of the share price. So if you sell for 2 cents below the next ask price, you‚Äôre selling at a 2% discount.",GoodAtStocks,1,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/n0rbtz/why_do_some_stocks_look_like_this_instead_of/gw973ah/,0.072,0.789,0.138,0.8439

38,TRCH," Yes. Very wrong. Unfortunately I‚Äôve been seeing a lot of this on StockTwits where people are either not understanding the dates or being misinformed by others. I‚Äôm going to chalk it up to people being brand new to TRCH/MMAT with some of the hype.

Key dates:

By April 30th - announcement of a Special Meeting to vote on the Merger with MMATF (Metamaterial Inc.)

May 10 - this is the Anticipated meeting date for that special meeting. This date has been referenced multiple times in SEC filings.

Shortly after May 10 (Special Meeting) - Based on tweets by George Palikaras and Torchlight, shortly after the meeting, the Ex Dividend Date for the TRCH shares will be determined. Meaning you have a little while yet to get shares for the dividend.

‚Äî Day before merger - MMATF Ratio to apply to their shares. You can still buy MMATF and get their ratio applied to the shares you buy. This was in a tweet by George Palikaras a while back.

I believe those are all of ACTUAL bits of information released.

What hasn‚Äôt been released (yet) and is pure speculation if anyone claims to know is:

‚Äî Dividend Amount - this is STILL up in the air and the estimates are all over.

‚Äî Merger Date - obviously this hinges on the Special Meeting and voting first.

‚Äî Dividend Payout Date - only thing that has been referenced is that it needs to happen before 12/31/2021.


Look up this stuff on your own.
