9,ABBV," I think we're going to be looking at a bear market when the zombie companies fail, if not sooner. And it seems eminently rational to fear a crash based on the truly insane valuations of whole swaths of the market right now. 

Instead of a crash, though, we seem to be watching a slowly deflating balloon, likely because of the same stimulus and regulating effects of bot trades that helped give such a mostly-smooth boost all last year. But for the intervention of a shadowy SoftBank-like player making a big move, I expect the slow slide to continue until we've reached an *angle of repose* which will still be somewhat elevated (at least compared to historical norms) by 0%-interest debt and recent retail frenzy. 

The question, then, is when to buy in. And just like any dip or crash, I definitely subscribe to the notion that one shouldn't commit one's whole boodle in an attempt to time the bottom, and of course there are different schemes for how much to commit at which intervals. 

Anyway, I'm focusing on these in the short term:

33,GDP," [http://blog.yardeni.com/2021/03/checks-without-balances.html#links](http://blog.yardeni.com/2021/03/checks-without-balances.html#links)

>Washington’s lawmakers have discovered the joys of sending checks to their constituents during bad times. They’ve done it twice so far since the start of the pandemic and are likely to do it a third time shortly. The $1,200-per-person checks sent during April did work to revive the economy from last year’s two-month recession during March and April. The $600 checks sent during January certainly averted any stalling in economic growth in the face of the third wave of the pandemic. It’s not hard to guess what another round of $1,400 checks will do to the economy. Consider the following:  
  
>  
>(1) *Pandemic.* On a 10-day moving average basis, Covid-19 hospitalizations have plunged 55% from a record high of 130,386 during January 15 to 58,394 during February 26 ([Fig. 1](http://www.yardeni.com/pub/tc_20210302_1.png)). That’s the lowest pace since November 12, 2020. The new vaccine’s 72% efficacy rate in US clinical trials falls short of the roughly 95% rate found in studies testing the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines. Across all trial sites, the Johnson & Johnson vaccine also showed 85% efficacy against severe forms of Covid-19 and 100% efficacy against hospitalization and death. That sounds like a winner for sure! To repeat: 100% efficacy against hospitalization and death. That should turn the plague into a pest by the second half of this year.  
>  
>  
>  
>(2) *Real GDP.* The V-shaped recovery in real GDP will remain V-shaped during the first half of this year and probably through the end of the year. However, it will no longer be a “recovery” beyond Q1 because real GDP will have fully recovered during the current quarter. Thereafter, GDP will be in an “expansion” in record-high territory.  
  
>  
>Last year, real GDP rebounded 33.4% (saar) during Q3 and 4.1% during Q4 ([Fig. 2](http://www.yardeni.com/pub/tc_20210302_2.png)). We are projecting 7.0% during Q1. On Monday, we raised our Q2 estimate from 4.5% to 9.0%, mostly because we expect that President Biden’s American Rescue Plan will be enacted in the next few weeks.  
  
>  
>The plan will provide checks of $1,400 per eligible person, mostly during April, we reckon, providing another big boost to consumer incomes and spending. Last year, consumer spending in real GDP rose 41.0% during Q3 and 2.4% during Q4. The Atlanta Fed’s [GDPNow](https://www.frbatlanta.org/cqer/research/gdpnow) model showed an 8.8% increase in such spending during Q1 as of March 1 (with real GDP up 10.0%). We forecast that real consumer spending will increase 7.9% during Q1 and 11.3% during Q2.  
  
>  
>(3) *Personal income.* In current dollars, personal income jumped by a record 12.4% m/m during April 2020 as a result of a $3.3 trillion (saar) increase in government social benefits that month, thanks to the $1,200 checks and generous unemployment benefits ([Fig. 3](http://www.yardeni.com/pub/tc_20210302_3.png) and [Fig. 4](http://www.yardeni.com/pub/tc_20210302_4.png)). January’s 10.0% increase in personal income was the second biggest ever in a month, as a result of a $2.0 trillion increase in benefits attributable to the $600 checks.  
  
>  
>If the next round of $1,400 checks goes out in April, it will undoubtedly boost personal income by a new record amount to another record high! The “other” component of government social benefits in personal income includes an item for “Economic Impact Payments” ([Fig. 5](http://www.yardeni.com/pub/tc_20210302_5.png)). At an annual rate, these checks from the Treasury boosted benefits and total personal income by $2.6 trillion and $0.6 trillion, respectively, during April and May of last year. They boosted them both by $1.7 trillion during January. So they accounted for virtually the entire $1.9 trillion increase in personal income during January!  
  
>  
>(4) *Personal consumption.* The government checks certainly contributed to the V-shaped recovery in consumer spending ([Fig. 6](http://www.yardeni.com/pub/tc_20210302_6.png)). Another round of checks will do the same this spring. In current dollars, consumer spending rose 2.4% m/m during January, led by a 5.8% m/m increase in consumption of goods to a new record high. In coming months, consumers should be able to spend much more on services that have been limited by the pandemic’s social-distancing protocols.  
  
>  
>(5) *Personal saving.* During last year’s lockdowns, consumers couldn’t spend either their paychecks or government benefits as readily as usual since most stores and restaurants were closed. So personal saving soared to a record $6.4 trillion (saar) during April ([Fig. 7](http://www.yardeni.com/pub/tc_20210302_7.png)). It then fell to $2.3 trillion by December, which was still well above the $1.3 trillion pace of personal saving at the start of last year.  
  
>  
>Interestingly, January’s $2.0 trillion jump in government social benefits coincided with a $1.6 trillion increase in personal saving to $3.9 trillion, suggesting that much of the month’s stimulus hasn’t been spent yet. After the year-end holiday season, January is not a prime month for shopping.  
  
>  
>So there is plenty of stimulus left over. In addition, consumer revolving credit outstanding dropped $118 billion y/y through December to $976 billion ([Fig. 8](http://www.yardeni.com/pub/tc_20210302_8.png)). The ratio of consumer revolving credit to personal consumption (both in current dollars) dropped from 7.4% to 6.7% over this period ([Fig. 9](http://www.yardeni.com/pub/tc_20210302_9.png)). This suggests that consumers aren’t as reliant on their credit cards because they have plenty of cash. Moreover, once they spend their extra cash, they can always tap into their credit cards again.  
  
>  
>(6) *Unemployment benefits.* The Biden plan will extend temporary pandemic relief programs for unemployed workers, expiring on March 14, to August 26. Benefit recipients would also get an extra $400 a week. More than 19 million Americans were collecting benefits as of early February, according to the Labor Department. Last year, unemployment benefits in personal income totaled $550.2 billion, up from $27.7 billion during 2019.  
  
>  
>(7) *Bottom line.* There is plenty of stimulus left in the pipeline from last year’s pandemic rescue programs. More rounds of government stimulus programs this year are likely to cause a boom that overheats the post-pandemic economy, which might result in higher inflation. The government’s overly generous extended unemployment benefits could frustrate policymakers’ goal of achieving full employment while driving up wage inflation.

40,VERY," > ""Trump wanting to fire Powell"" is pretty obvious bullshit news that wouldn't happen.

It's really not if you were tuned in to the whole situation.  It's not like it's unlikely that Trump would have attempted such a move, and the legality of it was regularly discussed as ambiguous at best during the time period.  Even if he was not successful that wouldn't prevent instability from an attempt.  The white house lawyers were even regularly consulted to discuss if it was plausible.

>Take a look at an interactive chart, I believe Jan 4 was the day Powell changed his tune. You can see the day was big red and VERY close to the bottom of the 2018 crash.

I don't need to look at a chart because I remember it off the top of my head.  Feel free to check for yourself but I'm willing to bet the market bottom was on December 24.

45,CEO," If you can't be rational about it, you shouldn't be trading single stocks.

The markets are chaotic and they behave in unpredictable ways but if a company is good, it WILL eventually grow. But you need to do a lot of research and have a lot of confidence in your research for that. If you're confident of that 30% drop being just random shit, you can buy in more. If you're not and panic, you shouldn't have been in that situation in the first place.

Doing proper research on stocks is a LOT of work(the DDs you see on reddit read like wishful fanfics to justify their beliefs). I personally do not have the time for it(nor am I arrogant enough to believe I can outsmart people who do this full time), so I maintain a highly diversified(all sectors, geologically diversified) portfolio which is very stable and gives decent returns(I'm up 25% in 2 years and that's while DCA'ing in. If it was a lumpsum investment at the start it'd of course be a lot more. Of course I do not expect these returns forever, this has been a huge bull market). It's still up month-to-month despite this big dip because I didn't get greedy on tech.

Or you can choose to just make educated guesses(I like what these guys make, I know the CEO is a smart guy) and buy off that. It's a step up from gambling, but it probably won't inspire the level of confidence not to panic and lock in your losses.",creepy_doll,1,/r/investing/comments/ly0sol/lessons_from_the_december_2018_market_correction/gpr83cz/,0.072,0.777,0.151,0.9734

69,GE," It's the bond market bears leaking into the stock market, particularly tech (which for what it's worth I am personally getting taken to the cleaners on).

You have to realize that the Fed has been pumping the bond market for years with their ""quantitative easing"", i.e. buying a fuckload of bonds per month and keeping liquidity in the bond market. This also has a direct impact on stocks as it makes borrowing money easier for companies so they can grow.

Rewind a few weeks ago and the bond investors latched on to the news of a strong economic recovery. So they think ""hmm all this cash pumped into the market has to go somewhere... it's going to lead to massive inflation"" which is terrible for bonds because their already low yields can't even keep up with inflation when it's high. So bond bears get spooked and sell off a fuckload of bonds, something like $50b over the course of a few days, and they do it so quickly and unplanned it catches people off guard and sent into panic mode. In reality this is them having a tantrum demanding higher yields on longer term bonds to outpace rapid growth and inflation.

Now remember the Fed is propping this market up literally by buying a shitload of bonds monthly for almost the past decade. So the bond investors are addicted to the Fed support, and now they're basically saying they need more. The bond sell off drops bond prices lower and spikes yields higher and now bond investors are even more spooked and it's one giant feedback loop.

Fast forward to today. The bond market is all fucked with bond investors essentially demanding more from the Fed, because they're worried about possible inflation and even _maybe_ sometime down the line the fed tapering their support and reducing their monthly bond buying. They pulled these shenanigans back in 2013 and it caused a bond market crash then too. Keep in mind at this point, the Fed has not mentioned shit about tapering support, and JPow even said they'll keep it going for years, and when it does begin it will be extremely gradual. Not good enough for bond bears... now they want the Fed to step in and prevent yields from growing too much, basically protecting the prices of existing bonds that they themselves caused to dip. They want the Fed to, wait for it... buy more fucking bonds to increase demand and raise prices again. 

So today JPow gives a speech and basically says ""fuck off bond bears... you're worried about nothing... inflation isn't going to be high... we're HOPING it hits 2% and even then it will be short term... And also we're not going to do jack about yields because we're already buying $120b per month of your shitty bonds what more do you want?"" My words not his.

Anyway this displeases the bond bears and they don't believe JPow so they sell off even more... and nobody is buying because they're all fucking spooked... so the prices tank and yields rise to the highest in over a year.

This is how it leaks into the stock market. Now yields are higher, and on paper, it becomes more expensive for companies to borrow money literally over night. Tech companies in particular, which need to borrow to grow, would be hit the hardest by this. So stock investors, who were already worried about an overheated market, and we're already rotating into stuff they think will grow faster during a COVID recovery, catch wind of this bond bear shit, and sell off all their tech into boring shit with solid cash flows like fucking Bank of America, and GE, and Ford, and all other value stuff.

No, it is not. 

>Early each month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) of the U.S. Department of Labor announces the total number of employed and unemployed people in the United States for the previous month, along with many characteristics about them. These figures, particularly the unemployment rate—which tells you the percentage of the labor force that is unemployed—receive wide coverage in the media.

>**Some people think that to get these figures on unemployment, the government uses the number of people collecting unemployment insurance (UI) benefits under state or federal government programs.

Jesus Christ, not it does NOT. Did you even read my post above. Actually, did you read the QUOTE cited directly from the BLS on why they can't use unemployment insurance to measure unemployment? Here, I'll post it gain:

>Some people think that to get these figures on unemployment, the government uses the number of people collecting unemployment insurance (UI) benefits under state or federal government programs. But some people are still jobless when their benefits run out, and many more are not eligible at all or delay or never apply for benefits. So, quite clearly, UI information cannot be used as a source for complete information on the number of unemployed.

And just for the hell of it, here's a Snopes link:

>Claim:   The government understates the unemployment rate because they report how many people are collecting unemployment insurance rather than how many people are out of work.

>Status:   **False**.

>Origins:   Although this belief is widespread and has at times been reported as factual in the mainstream media, the truth of the matter is that unemployment statistics are gathered through a process of sampling a representative number of households; they are not arrived by counting the number of unemployment insurance claims made during a particular month. Data collected in the Current Population Survey (CPS), a monthly survey of over 60,000 households, is used for this purpose. From this data, an extrapolation is made about the unemployment status of the country as a whole.

>Were this not so, jobless people whose benefits have run out would not be included in the number. Likewise, those who were never eligible for benefits or who never applied would be missed, rendering the statistic inaccurate.

94,SAP," My thought on this:

If I invest I want a 5% return a year, I don't see this happening for Palantir. Valuation is now  44.6bn, for a future dividend of 5% per year they would need a profit this year of 2.23bn, but they still don't make a profit, so next year they would have to make a profit of at least 4.683bn (and so on if they still don't make a profit). This is a huge gap with reality, having a revenue of 1.1bn.

The assumption is that they can scale their software easily like other software platform is false in my opinion. Their software is for big players and sold through consultancy, so Palantir's business model would be more comparable to a company like SAS Institue or SAP SE. Palentir still has a great potential, but they are definitely not yet worth 44.6bn, more like 10-15bn like SAP in the early days  (i.e. the initial Palantir IPO price).

At $45 billion, PLTR will have a really difficult time to get to $90 billion ($50/share).

These enterprise contracts are not easy to find or close, and there's also not many of them. Their potential market is limited.

They also have horrible churn rate. Which is bad, because onboarding and setting up a new client takes up to a year or even more.

It also takes over 6 months to close a large contract (which is before the many months of setting up the client and onboarding), so there is a lot of sales foot-work involved, and a lot of that time invested in sales leads goes nowhere. You can spend a year pursuing a client, and they'll go with an alternative provider, or the anticipated project altogether gets cancelled.

Check how much they spent on the sales department last year.

PLTR is not a SaaS like Spotify where customers can basically signup, pay, and start on their own.

PLTR is a tech consultancy agency, basically. And agencies are shit when it comes to scaling. 

Because to double revenue, you need to double staff, technology and office space, so your costs also double (if not more, because scaling tech increase complexity, and complexity involves higher costs).

The truth will be in the churn rate. You need to get at least 2 renewals from every client (about 3-5 years of service per client project) to get to a place of decent profitability, otherwise you're barely covering costs for sales, setup/onboarding, and server management expenses.

And God hope they never have a security breach, considering they work with highly classified military projects. It's extremely expensive to maintain that level of security, because you're a honey-pot for hackers, you attract all the best hackers who want to penetrate your services (including foreign governments like Russia and China), and you need to pay top-dollar to defend against that level of hacking. Salaries for top-notch security engineers can easily run $1 mil+ per year. So it's very expensive to secure properly.

As a private tech business, I would honestly not accept any military contracts, because it's just not worth the headaches. Unless we had a limitless budget, which is never the case with government contracts. Your company can even be sued for not delivering to contract, even when the terms of the contract require you to spend more than you're making, because you underpriced when you estimated the scope of the work.

117,PLTR," >Palantir could be on the verge of enterprise software

That's one of the biggest misconceptions about PLTR. They are nowhere ""near the verge"" of being a scalable software vendor. It's painfully unscalable consulting and customizing at the moment and only if everything goes right, they might be seen as a regular SaaS business, which might happen maybe in a few years. Until there is any signal that this is actually possible (a measly growth rate of 40 to 50 percent is neither indicative of that, but also not really a turn-on considering the valuation requires exponential growth - similar as with TSLA), you're basically exposed to risks similar to a seed stage investor.

131,PLTR," My comment is purely to point out that companies like PLTR dont make profits early on for a reason. Not defending pltr.
All big companies struggled to make profits until a certain point of time. As i said, companies reinvesting in future growth generally dont generate great profits or in general profits right away. They take time to make profits. Amazon maybe a market leader now. But when it started as a company ppl laughed at the idea. They started small with selling books online and slowly grew their products. Their biggest positive cash flow infact can be accounted to aws. Until then they weren’t a juggernaut that they are today. 
But ppl who believed e retailer is the future didnt worry abt amazon making profits at the time they just wanted it grow as much as it can. Same can b said abt PLTR. Their product is good , they are getting a lot of contracts and they are building a brand recognition in their space.",sack_of_potahtoes,1,/r/investing/comments/ly5dfu/palantir_is_the_best_long_run_pltr/gprflcs/,0.119,0.766,0.115,0.0408

Now? People are dumping their $ into commodity plays like weed stocks, solar panel companies, and generic companies with ""tech"" labels slapped onto them to fetch a higher valuation (ex: $LMND, $SOFI).

**Edit to add this:** Just a suggestion: Where there is hype, there are salespeople trying to sell you a product.  And yes, stocks count as products, and there is a LOT of people who stand to benefit from selling their product to investors (usually the Chamaths of the world).

They were manufacturing 28nm DDICs 3 years ahead of MagnaChip.

They've had tremendous pressure from Samsung and lost market, they admit as much:

https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/02/05/synaptics-inc-syna-q2-2021-earnings-call-transcrip/

> So certainly, in the near term, we believe that, that's going to be -- we're going to mix our business toward touch controllers. In, call it, the second half of the year, as I mentioned, we do see a frontier opening up on OLED DDICs. Today, we have no revenue there. We don't think that -- in a backward look, we thought the margins were going to be challenged there, but the dynamics have changed very significantly in that market, and we think that there's going to be a tactical opportunity. So depending on how that plays out, we could see a remixing toward DDIC in the second half of the year.

But they have the technology and engineering.

That said LG once they become an AAPL oled panel supplier has a very high chance of using MX. Again not a concern the market is large

239,CRWD," I've been every type of investor in the past 10 years. I bought Apple and Tesla in 2013 and sold them soon after because I couldn't take the stress of the changes. I switched to low-cost index funds for a few years, then Schwab's Intelligent Advisory for a few more years.

During quarantine, I started dabbling in options trading. After enough articles from TheVerge about self-proclaimed idiots who eat crayons making millions, I put $5,000 into a Robinhood account. Then the worst thing that could happen happened - I made money on my first 8 options trades. A lot. Which I thought meant I was a genius with previously untapped instincts. Then I bought 8 more options that all ended valueless. I'm not a genius.

I decided it'd be smart to read about smart options traders. I switched from naked calls to call spreads, long puts to put spreads, and even dabbled in synthetic longs and diagonals. I still don't know what an Iron Condor is.

In January I made a bunch of money on GameStop and then I subsequently lost almost all that money on GameStop. I decided to read more content from smart people. I read GauchoRico and Saul's Investing Discussions on TheMotleyFool and it clicked. This is the thesis I wanted - buy good companies who are increasing their profits each year and hold them for the medium to long term. I looked at their research, then did my own. These companies were extremely legit.

2) More broadly, this move falls in line with the recent transition from growth to value.

256,REV," REV
I'm new. Just started learning to trade.


If Citi accidentally paid off $500M of their debt and a judge ruled they couldn't get it back, is REV still on the hook, or did the obligation just move directly to Citi instead of the original creditors?


Next question- 
Country is reopening and stimulus checks are pretty much guaranteed. Ladies are going to be leaving the house more, and to do that we need beauty products. 
REV hasn't recovered to pre-covid levels. 
They had a positive Q3.
6.8M float, 53M outstanding, 1.94M short up from 1.8M, 28.9% short float.


Why isn't REV on the upswing and why would shorts be increasing? To me, demand is going to skyrocket and they have a huge portfolio of brands at multiple price points.

285,UAL," Travel ETF and airline stock?

Getting ready to enter the market with my savings, and am thinking of making a quick buck on industries that will rebound after COVID. I can see that JETS and select airline stocks still have a large gap to fill from pre-covid. My plan is:

JETS ETF - 4,000 USD + installements at lows
UAL - 2000 USD + installments at lows

* some overlap between the two, but UAL seems to have the biggest gap to fill.

*Take profit on airline invest when peak is reached or pre-covid gap filled.

*rest of my savings go to VTI (50%) and VXUS (20%). Rebalance after post-COVID boom.

Most of the tech stocks are priced to perfection and people are rightly taking profits and moving into sectors at lower valuations, as well as some movement into places like emerging markets. 

If interest rates start moving up consistently there will be added fears that the Fed may have to raise rates sooner than 2035 or whatever everyone is counting on, which would also make it harder for many of these tech companies that have huge amounts of debt and zero profits to exist, but that still feels like a ways off to me.",Suspicious_Tension82,2,/r/investing/comments/ly8p91/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/gpthsp7/,0.058,0.807,0.135,0.886

I'd still rather airports (things like Vinci, Aeroports De Paris, the 3 in Mexico, etc.) than airlines. Vinci is airports and a number of other things, but perhaps a beneficiary if there's infrastructure spending (which...I'm not going to be expecting, but ya never know.) Airports to me with all manner of fees being paid by airlines and travelers - not to mention retail space with a captive audience (retail space that is actually compelling being a rarer and rarer thing) - is a more interesting long-term business if you think people go right back to flying.",dvdmovie1,3,/r/investing/comments/ly8p91/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/gprdzmv/,0.013,0.868,0.119,0.9371

They had a misstep I think from a PR point of view with the manager bonuses, but other than that..they are a well ran airline.  They also have their own fuel refining operations that I believe will position them well for fuel price increases.  International travel will likely resume this summer further giving them a boost.

349,NOK,"  

Hello everyone.

A few months ago, I added $100.00 to my fidelity account and watched the market. I kept an eye on NOK, read daily for a couple months, did some tutorials, and today I just invested 25.00 of the 100.00 I have in the fidelity account on this stock (I have some 50 grand in savings that is NOT anywhere but my savings account and won't be anywhere else.) I set the limit at the stock's current limit, which is what I was advised to do. This is more practice for me, since it is such a small amount of money, but I have this incredible anxiety that somehow I will lose thousands of dollars. This is crazy, right? I invested the amount I did just to practice on something low stakes. Did anyone else get incredible anxiety their first time investing?",seemoreglass32,2,/r/investing/comments/ly8ont/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gpszcef/,0.098,0.887,0.014,-0.8948

351,HY," Hello all. Unsophisticated ""fill up the retirement accounts with indexes, play money in only slightly riskier growth etfs"" type of investor here, thinking about making a risky (for me) play with my finances and wondering if I could get some advice.

With the death of HYSA interest rates over the past year and it looking like they won't be coming back any time soon, my wife and I were thinking about bringing those funds into the market. We don't have kids or any major non-emergency expenses coming up so I was thinking that we are well-positioned to weather short-term losses from the up/downs of the market for the prospect of a little bit extra gain in our funds, also to potentially hedge against inflation if it comes as well. 

I feel like I should know the answer to this but I can't seem to decide where would be a better place to put this money if we make this decision. The point of this move would be to take more risk in order to get better returns than an HYSA or Bonds.

I feel like I should just be buying index funds, but without any experience, I am wondering if I am missing something by not looking at very stable dividend paying stocks. This is what I would like advice with. If you were making a decision like mine (having accepted the risk), would you put this money in indexes or in some of the dividend aristocrats? Another, newer option is Crypto HY savings like BlockFi, promising 8% returns on your USD, but this is probably too risky for my tastes.

Just looking for opinions, but if it were you, would you stash this money in VOO, VTI, VT, QQQ (indexs), SPDH or VYM (dividend focused)?

354,DD," Hey guys, I'm fairly new at the market I got a taste of it this week when I made the silly mistakes I kept reading not to do (buying yolo penny stocks and even some established green stocks and selling out of panic just to see it rise back up again haha).  
Fortunately I did invested only money I was ok with losing and while it sucks that I lost around $200 of my initial $1000 I'm taking it as a learning experience but also kinda saying fuck it with those remaining $800 and keep learning with those haha.  
But anyways I got another $1000 coming in that I want to invest, but  I want to invest on the long term (10+ years) and slowly add every month to it. Is it a better bet to just get ETFs or more established stocks/indexes?  
One of my issues with my initial 1k was that it felt weird buying a 1-3 stocks of a company and paying the $5 commission fee on it, it just felt weird. Was I thinking to short term thinking what's the point of getting 2 stocks instead of slowly building it? Also should I focus on let's say 2-3 companies while I slowly build up more buying potential so I can focus on those I trust with some good DD or is it better to spread a bit more and then add or remove based on more DD?

360,FI," Hi all, I graduated and started working in December of 2019. Making 95k a year, paying off loans, already have a safety net and maxing out retirement accounts (I plan to retire early, but this isn't a FI question).

I have about 10k a year to invest outside of retirement accounts right now, and it comes paycheck by paycheck. I started investing steadily last year into total market stock and bond indexes, but I want stronger growth, and I'm open to short term risk, having a 10 year time horizon roughly. 

My question really is, I feel like I've had the wrong strategy every time. During covid, I just went into stock market and bond market indexes - but growth stocks would have been higher. I just didn't know enough about individual stock picking to trust myself, but I wish I had. I started educating myself enough to buy individual stocks in January this year, and had a plan to follow - some Motley Fool picks (my dad uses them and it's worked great for him) and some companies/sectors I strongly believe in (gaming, green energy, AI). But seeing the new sentiment, that growth stocks are overvalued and will be correcting, I now don't know if I'd be safer putting my money back into total market indexes, or staying the course with stock picking. 

Any thoughts? I never have a lump sum to invest, so it's always DCA into my chosen investments when I get paid. I'm okay with risk, and I don't want to miss out on growth like I did in 2020, but I really don't want to screw myself by investing in growth stocks if they're going to underperform during my time horizon.

USA, no debt besides mortgage, medium risk tolerance

I rolled over a 401k to my own personal IRA recently. Previously I was lazily investing in just a target date mutual fund but now I want to invest in other funds. I’m targeting retirement around 2045-2050. I’m thinking of the following:

30%-Fidelity® Blue Chip Growth Fund (FBGRX)

40% -Schwab Fundamental US Large Company Idx (SFLNX) -

I'd favor a stronger distribution towards ETFs. Obviously you're pretty young so can handle the higher risk of individual picks, but I've found 90% of the time my ETFs are outperforming my picks over the long run. 

Second thing I want to mention in case you hadn't considered it is that there is a geopolitical risk to holding Chinese tech and other stocks like Baba. Based on your picks it seems like you might be in Canada so the situation might be a little different there, but the next 5-10 years could be quite turbulent with North America/China relationships, and even the rumor of the Biden or future administration clamping down on Chinese financial holdings could send it tanking.  There was serious discussion during the Trump admin of blacklisting BABA and TCEHY in the US, and I suspect this will be something that continues to pop up as relations between the US and China worsen. I still think BABA is fine, but I don't think I'd have quite that much of my portfolio in it because the potential downside is really really bad.",ColonelUber,5,/r/investing/comments/ly8ont/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gprrbm1/,0.101,0.82,0.079,-0.8155

I don't like giving financial advice, but if you want to consider 10+ year long positions I highly recommend learning all you can about Warren Buffet. To parrot many big investors, the safest route (but not guaranteed) is probably investing in the SP500 index. Historically, it has returns of approx. 7%. And yes, panic selling is the killer of portfolios. Now that's not to say exiting a position can't help you. It's 10% skill and 90% luck, IMO. 

That being said, if a stock has a good track record, pulling out of dips will probably not be in your favor. With penny stocks, there's quite a few people hanging around look for day/swing trades and some have enough money to singularly manipulate that stock. 

There are many styles of trading and investing. You just need to align yourself with your goals and style. I'm fairly new to this myself as every day I learn so so much more. All I can say is educate, educate, educate.

25% on the growth funds or growth stocks.
Vanguard has a good one, VWUSX. It’s gone down over the past month, but it’s been consistent since before the pandemic.

You could also consider BA, as it’s likely to get back to pre pandemic levels in 3-5 years. Or V or MA, which have remained somewhat stagnant because of the pandemic.

15% on bonds or dividend stocks like T or VZ

50% on an index fund, something like VTSAX as you mentioned.

25% on the growth funds or growth stocks.
Vanguard has a good one, VWUSX. It’s gone down over the past month, but it’s been consistent since before the pandemic.

You could also consider BA, as it’s likely to get back to pre pandemic levels in 3-5 years. Or V or MA, which have remained somewhat stagnant because of the pandemic.

15% on bonds or dividend stocks like T or VZ

373,GME," >I just dont get it other than something is going on with the options part of investing maybe?

That's basically the whole story. ""Shorting"" a stock is a process whereby you borrow a share (on the promise to return it by some date, paying a premium along the way) and sell it immediately. You're essentially betting the company is on a downward swing: if it goes down, you can buy it back later (to return to the person) at a cheaper price than you sold it for in the moment. 

GME is in a terrible, dying line of business, so *lots* of large players/hedge funds were shorting GME. Some folks (including famously some WallStreetBets users) discovered that *way* too many people had made these bets. Like, on the order of shorting more stock overall than even existed for the company. They realized that this created an opportunity for what's called a ""short squeeze"": when there are enough shorts out there (who *have* to buy shares eventually to meet their contractual obligations to return the shares they've borrowed and sold) you know there will be tons of demand for the shares, driving up the price.

This went along for a while, with people in the know buying up shares on the promise of this short squeeze coming that would shoot the price way up. This started coming to a critical mass in late January (I fully admit, I wasn't following closely enough to know what precipitated this) where it became a cultural event. People started thinking there was guaranteed money out there to be had if you just bought in and waited. Alternatively, some saw it as a way to ""stick it to the man"" and punish vulture-like hedge funds by having ""diamond hands"", never selling your shares, and (in their minds) forcing hedge funds to implode through astronomical losses. This of course ignored the *other* wealthy people you were helping by driving up GME's share price, but whatever. 

At this point, it's a meme through and through, [shooting up wildly in price in response to random tweets](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-retail-trading-gamestop-idUSKBN2AW2P5).",throwawayinvestacct,1,/r/investing/comments/ly8ont/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gptahr0/,0.035,0.889,0.076,0.7918

376,NAV," The differences are quite minute, particularly once you wipe away the tax efficiency of ETFs (which, honestly, I still don't think has a *huge* impact but whatever).

* ETFs *generally* have lower expense ratios. However, amongst the better index funds, this is pretty minimal. As you noted, VTWAX vs. VT is a 2 basis point difference. On a $100k portfolio, you're talking a $20/year difference.
* ETFs you *generally* have to buy in whole shares (though more and more brokers are allowing you to buy fractional shares), while mutual funds you can buy in with any $ amount (once you've hit the minimum initial investment). Theoretically, this leads to minor ""cash drag"" with ETFs. Take your example again: VT is ~$93 a share. If you have $100 of investable dollars, you could invest all $100 into VTWAX, but in VT (without fractional shares) you'd have ~$7 of cash sitting there uninvested. Again, very minor, marginal thing.
* Some mutual funds have minimum investments. This can be a barrier to entry, but this stops being relevant (for the most part) early on and some places are doing away with them (e.g., FTIHX, Fidelity's total-world-ex-US index fund, has no minimum investment).
* Mutual fund prices are tied directly to their net asset value (NAV), meaning they precisely reflect the value of what they hold when the trades execute. Because ETFs are traded on the open market, however, their share price can vary from the value of their underlying holdings. The [creation/redemption process](https://www.etf.com/etf-education-center/etf-basics/what-is-the-creationredemption-mechanism?nopaging=1) for ETF shares keeps this in line, particularly for extremely-liquid funds like major brokerage index funds. Not sure where you can see it easily (used to be prominently placed on Morningstar), but I think for major index ETFs you're talking the scale of a single penny of variance here most days, so it's only really a major issue to consider for illiquid ETFs.
* Mutual fund trades all execute at one time, after hours, ETFs trade during the day like stock. This isn't really inherently good or bad one way or the other. Some like being able to trade intra-day, some like not having to care (or even having the option) to try and time intra-day prices or whatever.

So, in sum, I'd say (broadly) you're talking generally slightly lower ER, no minimums (other than a single share price, and sometimes not even that with fractional shares), and intra-day trading for ETFs vs. no cash drag (though not an issue if your broker will trade fractional shares), no NAV issues (incredibly tiny), and end-of-day trading for mutual funds.",throwawayinvestacct,3,/r/investing/comments/ly8ont/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gpseywp/,0.084,0.801,0.116,0.9444

381,BABA," I think it is still ok to hold some Chinese picks, and it is a growing market ofc, just have to hedge a little bit. 

Is this a situation where you were looking to just buy a single share of baba? If you're ok with the geopolitical risk with a lower stake, you could look into TCEHY (which is OTC rather than NYSE), since you could buy 1-2 shares for about 37% or 75% of the cost of BABA (but their business is different, it does have some overlap). Do your diligence of course, and I'll note this is still subject to the same risk, but if you're working with lower dollar values it is easier to put TCEHY into a balanced portfolio.

The other thing I'd note is that if you're just picking up that one or two shares of BABA, you'll be able to bring its share of your portfolio down over time as you add money to it. I don't think there is an immediate risk where your investment goes to junk in 6 months from now.

With 10k CAD, 2 shares would put you at about 6% of your total (just doing some rough math here) which is a little more healthy imo. You could bring this down to 4 or 5% over time when you add in the future.

My personal rule of thumb is to not go over 5% of my portfolio into a single pick unless I have an extremely compelling reason to do so (this is also easier to do with more money).

If inflation begins to take off, feds raise rates and bond prices plummet. 10 year yield is approx 1.5 right now. If yields rise to 3%, a 1000 face value bond @1.5% will drop to ~870.  There's very little room for yields to decrease, so I feel like bonds aren't the safest of harbors, so to speak.

416,BYD," I have BYD, it performed very well for me in the past. Berkshire Hathaway owns 10%. Charlie Munger was very enthusiastic about the company at the time and they wanted to buy 25%, but the management rejected, which Buffet considered a good sign. From my point of view they just need to ramp up production faster. What I don't like so much about them is getting up to date information is difficult.",JackOfAllTrades211,3,/r/investing/comments/lyaxp3/a_few_stock_ideas_uhal_lvmhf_ugi_inuit_byd/gprrtbo/,0.128,0.776,0.096,-0.5532
417,BYD," BYD also teamed up with PepsiCo to develop plant based snacks and drinks. So in the world of food and beverage where the margins are so slim and competition is vast, the real war is won on the shelf and what consumers scan the shelves for and buy.

418,UK," I feel like this is an entirely fair point and that maybe anyone who reads what I'm saying should be aware of pitfalls you mention here. Now, a certain default rate is acceptable but if this is combined with downward pressure on house prices that would definitely have negative consequences for the stock. I wouldn't be surprised to see a higher default rate but I'd be surprised to see a significant downward movement on the housing stock.

Surprisingly, and this is where people would disagree with me, I think that interest rates can go even lower and that we'll see this as a trend in the recovery from covid. There is also the advantage that in the UK, affordability considerations are still made unlike what happened in the states in 2008. Not that those mortgages are really good for the people taking them out.",netheranthem,1,/r/investing/comments/lxx8yx/dd_big_uk_mortgage_lenders/gprt2ws/,0.109,0.733,0.158,0.7217
