0,SLQT, I saw something similar happen to SelectQuote and there may be more at play than earnings. The infrastructure bill included a provision that delays some changes to Medicare part D that affects distribution of rebates and this may have adversely affected the stock. SLQT lost 20% of its value overnight with no other news.,slipperymagoo,6,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/p3yuc2/goco_is_officially_a_penny_stock_and_is_massively/h8valq6/,0.136,0.776,0.088,-0.2075
1,RBC, Frank Morgan at RBC Capital lowered his to $17 from $20. He covers healthcare sector. However even a $10 pt is still 2x,ThyMagicConch,6,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/p3yuc2/goco_is_officially_a_penny_stock_and_is_massively/h8v7v8l/,0.067,0.933,0.0,-0.128
2,SNDL," I'm extra unimpressed with SNDL after earnings. They reported a $41 million loss after being profitable last quarter. They reported over $1 billion in cash/equivalents which I'm sure will replace the tired bagholder line of ""bUt tHeY hAvE 7o0 mIlLiOn iN cAsH!"" I think a reverse split is inevitable. However, even after all that it can be a profitable swing trade from time to time.",Itsboomhomie,2,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/p3v4uz/penny_stock_unusual_option_activity_813/h8wpkhy/,0.078,0.808,0.114,0.5334

4,ASRT," Generally, when penny stocks announce a RS they lose a LOT of value. This recently happened with popular penny stocks CTRM and ASRT. SNDL has 1.86 billion shares, 1.15 billion of which was issued between Sept 30 and Feb. 28.  At some point they'll be in danger of being in non-compliance with the NASDAQ (by being under $1/share for a certain period of time) and will have no other option than to RS.",Itsboomhomie,2,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/p3v4uz/penny_stock_unusual_option_activity_813/h8wtr6p/,0.103,0.78,0.118,0.0516

9,CRL," Avg cost 3.91 here, really disappointed by the CRL, however depending on how the meeting on Monday and further relations with the FDA go, I could see approval possible within the next 6 months, give or take 2 months.

12,CRL," While I didn’t find an opening to get positions, I was watching this one from the side. It’s disappointing that all the signs were pointing upward only to get a CRL. 

Do we know any specific details about what the CRL had issue with? Facility productions? I am considering buying long calls but I’d have to know the time frame on CRL adjustment to resubmission for approval",John_Wayfarer,1,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/p41rln/the_sec_should_investigate_the_fda_about_sesn/h8wu1rg/,0.031,0.902,0.067,0.5283
13,CRL," Interesting that their latest hire didn't receive his stock option grant immediately, but rather on the 16th. The news might not have come before the 16th, as the PDUFA date was 18th. But since the CRL dropped in the meantime, he now gets options with the CRL priced in. That'll be very advantageous for him if they resolve the issues.

""In connection with the hiring of Mr. Knighton, Sesen Bio intends to grant a non-statutory stock option. Under such grant, up to 400,000 shares of Sesen Bio common stock are purchasable upon vesting of the stock option within the ten-year term. The stock option vests over a four-year period, with one quarter of the underlying shares vesting on the first anniversary of the date of grant, and an additional 6.25% of the underlying shares vesting at the end of each successive three-month period following the one-year anniversary of the date of grant, subject to Mr. Knighton’s continued service with Sesen Bio.

The non-statutory stock option will be granted on August 16, 2021, at an exercise price equal to the closing price per share of Sesen Bio’s common stock on The Nasdaq Global Market on the date of grant.""",stompingllama,1,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/p41rln/the_sec_should_investigate_the_fda_about_sesn/h8x7oeq/,0.0,0.82,0.18,0.9891

I am going to start investing in drug companies that  drop like ZY and SESN.
