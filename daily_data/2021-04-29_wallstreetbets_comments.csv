44,GME," No. You just have infinite risk of losses if the stock goes to infinity or GME. Most brokers require some amount of cash for you to take that risk. 

You can also hedge it with a bought call at a higher price to cap losses at a trade for gains.

Example

Sell a call at a $5 strike

Buy a call at a $10 strike

53,AMC," As someone who is new to Calls/Puts *please* tell me if my analysis is actually OP's intention on future tendies.

OP paid ~$366,000 for 377 *contracts* which allows the *purchase* of 37,700(377 contracts) shares of GME if the price goes over $800 by July 16th.

Let's say the stock actually hits $801 on July 15th(1 day before expiration) making the contract valid. For this example let's say OP wants to excercise the call on that day, the 15th. 37,000 shares are bought @$800 equalling $30,160,000(assuming OP has $30,160,000 on hand, ready for the exchange). Hooray! now OP has owns 37,700 shares actually worth $30,197,700 giving an initial profit of $37,700. Now we minus the initial premium of $366,000 and OP has officially lost $328,300 even though the stock went over and the contract is valid. But if the stock was at $799 or lower on July 16th, OP would lose the contracts and total loss would be $366,000 **Insane risk.**

On a very extreme extreme example, if GME hits $1500, these contracts are worth $56,550,000(again assuming OP has $30,160,000 to buy them) giving a total profit of $26,390,000- $366,000 initial investment(premium).

Now I look at just straight buy. $366,000 buys 2,440 shares @ $150. If the stock reaches $800, your stock is worth $1,952,000($1,586,000 profit). **Nearly zero risk, can sell the stock at any time.**

Then there is the ability to **sell** the contracts, but at this time I can't visualize it. Can OP make serious profit if GME hits $600 around July 1st? This is also assuming enough people are available to buy these I am trying to see the worth in these contracts. Basically, OP is so YOLO that GME will rocket, it not only will reach $800, it will reach $1k, $2K, even $4k? So much so they would just throw $366k on that bet?

(side note I bought an $11 AMC **put** contract for $54 expiring the 30th. As of today it is $10.89. I expected to get $1000 from it to fill my tub with ranch, set the ovens at 400 and have a tendy orgy because I risked losing 100% of my investment and who the fuck would pay $54 to make $5??!? Even if it dropped to $10 I would only double my money. It is 3x the risk for *maybe* double the money(in such a short window). Now I see this is the worst thing ever to gamble with. Unless you have insider info, these extreme options are a dumpster fire.)

Unless someone can give me an example of a good option???? My fucking head right now.

Also, if you don't have the capital to buy the stock at the time of expiration and you havent sold it already, what happens?

I mean 5Gs been out for a little while now and no its not full force working at its full potential but, Apple, Qualcomm, Verizon, and shit even ATT are all better suited to have any meaninful results from the 5G rollout. Just my opinion of course and thats really worth shit soo fuck it.

Edit:
Also all the mineral rich countries like Botswana (Diamonds), Zimbabwe (Gold, Diamonds, Platinum), Zambia (copper) to the north of South Africa are serviced by companies based in South Africa. They are also land locked and a lot of minerals and those countries exports go out through South African sea ports like Durban Harbor.

The company is far more undervalued when it is being compared with other archaic  medical insurance companies . Chamath especially loves this company because it uses artificial intelligence technology to analyze customers‚Äô data. Think about how Tesla went from 5 dollars to 500 dollars a share in just a few months . If I see CLOV hitting 20 by the end of this week , I would not be surprised . The company is currently undervalued because of those fucking shorters who hate new startups with disruptive technology .

CLOV is the Tesla of the healthcare insurance sector. With Democrats‚Äô control of the house , Medicare will expand significant in the next few months .

I do think that Youtube or Twitch are operating very differently from NFLX or VIAC. The fact that both business models exist proves the point that the society is diversified, and we need diversified content.

It would be difficult for individual content creators to create TV series or movies. Collaboration on the corporate level is important, and that is why this world has been operating in corporations.

* This was paired with the chairman pitching the stock on CNBC with some...interestingly creative claims. It's been paired with pumps in a handful of generic pumping shops. 
* There was a fairly large-sized swell this past week and a half in EVs and alternative energy. Other fraud/vaporware companies (I'm looking at you, PLUG, BLNK, QS) have also been trending up for no reason I can discern other than a bullish sector on TSLA earnings + infrastructure.

1195,ALL," **HEY ALL.** **This is the OP here.** First post after the earnings beat. Someone called me the Captain so I'm going to assume that role lol. Congrats for having the balls and brains to hop aboard. Now the question's what we do next.

**I propose we meet back here at 10:30pm Eastern Time. Also can you upvote this message so it pops to the top?**

I've taken a quick look at the numbers and **we got the blow out we were looking for**. Smashed projections. **Our calls will likely be worth 2x at opening bell tomorrow. :)**

**For those holding shares, my opinion (not advice) is that you should hold long term.** I know no other stock with a stronger risk/reward from here and expect it to double in 2-3 years. Very little downside. If it gets broken up by regulators, great it's worth more. If we get a Covid surprise, e-commerce & AWS will benefit.

**For those holding call options, now the question is do we sell at opening bell or do we hold**. For me the question is will it hit 4000 by June 4. I will be spending a few hours digging into the numbers and I have a few sources I'll be reading this evening before I come to a decision for myself.

**For anyone who is in a similar boat, want to meet here at 10:30pm Eastern Time tonight? By that point I'll be more informed on the numbers and will have made a decision for myself. Would be great to hear other takes as well.**

**If you wanna stay connected after all this is over then connect with me on Twitter.** I do this shit full time and am always looking for asymmetric plays like this. [https://twitter.com/WWSubstack](https://twitter.com/WWSubstack)

Next week we have a buncha micro cap earnings and there's a few that could make for good plays.

1325,TSLA," I've thought about this. If you wanna step up your brain wrinkle game, you'll wanna pull up some actuarial tables to calculate Elon Musk's life expectancy in a more granular fashion based on what we know about him. For example, rich people live longer. You can quantify that and factor it into your model.

Then, after computing the probability of Elon dying, you'll wanna use the Kelly Criterion to place bets.

You are, in effect, buying life insurance for Elon Musk with you as the beneficiary but under the assumption that the insurance broker (the market) has not properly priced in the probability of Elon Musk's death.

The trouble is TSLA IV is so high it has probably already priced in much worse than the death of Elon Musk. But I'm not certain, just a hunch. You'll have to run the numbers (and even then, you'll need to make some assumptions which may or may not bear out).",squats_n_oatz,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n0q28w/elon_musk_and_tesla_bearish_case/gw9cn7j/,0.119,0.856,0.025,-0.96
