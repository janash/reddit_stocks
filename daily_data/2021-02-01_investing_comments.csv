2,GME," Good post. Ended up here trying to find the rational side of Reddit after a buddy got me swept up in the WSB madness. Don't get me wrong...I'm still in it. Still hoping for a paradigm shift, still seeing plenty of reasonable-to-intelligent sounding vloggers, bloggers and Redditors making a case for GME. Not willing to throw in more then I already have (which I am OK, if a little sad) about losing.

The rational side of me sort of assumes this will flame itself out, but that's exactly what my rational brain would have said before the 2008 crash if a handful of people online started screaming about the impending subprime mortgage crisis months before 'everyone else' seemed aware of it.

This is addictive, though. The rage, the vulgarity...the perception of having power you probably don't actually have. Must feel quite a bit like what those Q-Anon loonies went through on their descent down the rabbit hole.

I see things like the VIX moving in seeming correlation with GME, Goldman's alleged warning (though I can't see that anywhere but ZH and have no idea what was actually said), a bit of a big tech selling off (so desperate shorts can cover, of course!) and my gut says these brokers messed up...they're still bleeding...still desperate, and the squeeze thesis remains valid if shares remain out of their reach.

Even the Citadel news above; their verbiage seems confusing...graf says retail were net buyers Monday and sellers the rest of the week. But then it references the number of buy orders and sell orders, which if I'm not completely insane with conspiracy right now, seems like a different figure. If buy orders averaged 10 shares per trade and sell orders averaged 3 - which would kind of be in line with what I'm doing myself to lower risk while staying engaged - there might be a 50/50 split in the number of orders but considerably more shares would be staying in retail hands.

TL;DR: This is insane and out of an abundance of caution anyone going all-in who isn't at least considering an exist strategy should be.",MarsTellus13,199,/r/investing/comments/la3bft/emotional_involvement_has_never_been_this_high/gllqf67/,0.119,0.782,0.1,-0.9102
3,GME," * WallStreetBets has never been anything but the megaphone on this.  There are certainly retail investors buying, but they're not what's moving the stock.  That's hedge funds and other institutional investors throwing their money behind the megaphone.

* Don't discount emotional investing in the short-term.  At the end of the day, stock price is a supply and demand issue.  There's a supply of shares.  There's a demand for shares.  Where those two intersect you find the price.  Typically, demand for a stock is based upon the perceived fundamentals of the company.  But that's not the only thing that can affect demand.  And you can make a lot of money identifying those other sources of demand.

* I don't know what percentage it is, but there are certainly *some* retail investors in GME that look at it *only* as an emotional investment.  They honestly don't care about the money.

4,MSFT," My first exposure to the stock market was Nortel, namely hearing about parents of friends that lost their Nortel jobs and also 100% of their saving because it was all in Nortel stocks. Also at my first job the owner's wife swore off owning stocks because she also put all of her money in Nortel stock and lost everything.

I was pretty interested in following the month by month recap of the .com bubble when I was in College, that was before I had any disposable income. I loved investing from 2003 to 2018 because with some research you could find good stocks at good prices with upside (my largest single stock was MSFT from 2009 to 2018, other than that mostly ETF, zero bonds).

I really hate today's market. Normalized insanity. I blame the central banks mostly for the everything bubble.

I have worked on Wall St. and have seen AI like you would not believe.  They spend tens if not hundreds of millions developing their AI algo tech.  Their AI algos read news, forums, and the internet as a whole and post and write news articles to steer the herd as they front run trades on both sides.  

Your feedback across the web gives them tremendous data for the next moves.  Keep in mind AI thinks thousands of moves ahead, humans not so much.

You guys did have a hand in fueling this rocket up but once they saw the momentum and retail interest pop it through cretin resistance the big players took it from there.  

Do not fool yourselves, if I have big profits, at the very least, I would take my original money I started with off the table and let the rest ride, its the casino's money anyway.

17,JPM," TLDR Point 1: This is precisely why no one should play the SLV market media are selling. If Hedge Funds like Melvin are le Chiffre, then the governments and huge banks like JPM are Ian Fleming who can kill Bond with the writing of 1 sentence.

TLDR Point 2: Agreed no one will advise you when to sell, only when to buy and hold because nobody is invested when *you* sell. If you have time to check the market every minute, only then you stand a chance. BUT the VW squeeze took days in which a LOT of money could be made.

TLDR Point 3: This is why the phrase with *shiny rocks* is so important. It shows that the best action now is no action. (I am not allowed to type in the phrase which can be shortened to two emojis)

35,GME," 1. I really, really hope nobody thinks GME et al are worth their meme valuation.
2. Somebody WILL end up holding the bag.  But many retail investors in GME aren't in it for gains, they want to see hedge funds languish.  People gave months of their lives to Occupy Wall Street, a few hundred or even a thousand bucks is worth it to some, to strike back after no meaningful repercussions came out of 2008.  This is a game of chicken against institutions we loathe, with a fairly low entry cost, in my case my entire position is easily within the intraday difference of my portfolio.

39,GME," Damn dude, you’re right on the money here, pun intended. I’m guilty of getting caught up in the excitement myself but these people are on a whole differently level of trading than us; they get far better tools, far better information and have far more friends in high places, willing to bend or even break the rules, in order to help bail them out. 

Wall Street is corrupt, our government is corrupt, our churches are corrupt. *Everything* is meant to keep us peasants *in our place* and I don’t know how anyone can feel any differently after the past few months.

Do. Not. Risk. Yourself. Or. Your. Family. 

If you’re a young, single guy or gal that is in a spot that you can comfortably throw away a grand, go ahead then and give it a try, but if not, for the love of Christ, don’t do anything that exposes yourselves to too much risk; someone *will get left holding the bag* on this. The promise of a quick payday and an easy life is the slimmest of chances for most of us and all too often, the actual odds are much more likely that you’ll lose everything. Washington *will* bail out the money; they always have and they always will. WE ARE NOT THE MONEY, even though we’re the backbone of the country. 

They won’t allow peasants into their country club. Play it safe and play the long game; save your money, invest it *wisely,* stay out of debt and plan for the future. Start a business, build your credit, don’t use credit cards more than 10% utilization and realize that while this GME bullshit *might* have started out as a pure way to “hit back,” there’s a high likelihood that a few rich investors are using *you* and the excitement/emotion of this to make a *lot* of money. 

At this point, you’re likely just helping someone get another lake house or something and there’s again, a high potential that this was a plan from someone higher on the food chain than us from the start. r/wallstreetbets has already stated recently, that they feel many of the “users” are plants, infiltrating the sub as counter-intelligence and psy-ops for Wall Street. We are small fish, no one on Wall Street cares if you lose your home, your car and your family becomes homeless. I don’t believe many, if *any* in Washington do either and if it comes between you or one of their fat-cat donors holding the bag, they’ll *always* choose to cut you loose, to save the money.

I was interested in GME this summer after reading about Cohen trying to take over steering the ship and decided to buy in right before the mania hit full steam when the price was in the $30 range. I placed a sell order for $200 and haven’t looked back when that hit. I have a friend that bought in when I suggested it and now he’s latched onto the hype and is still holding expecting this to hit $1000+. This is a fairly intelligent guy that does have some investing experience, so I can only imagine the lunacy your average new robinhood account holder with zero investing experiencing. It was funny a first but now it’s just sad seeing constant posts about holding forever and how this is some fairytale crusade against the evil hedge fund managers. These people have absolutely no clue what they are taking about and a LOT of people are going to lose significant amounts of money due to their own stupidity.

I do refute the data about retail buying/selling levels over the last week, however. It's clear that there have been coordinated efforts to short-ladder the stock down on low volume and snipe retail stop loss limits. Couple this with the fact that brokers like etoro are locking in automatic stop loss orders the require collateral to deactivate, and you've got a clear reason why retail investors last week were (barely) heavy on the sell-side. 

I mean come on, man - RH deactivated an entire list of securities that people aren't allowed to buy. You really want to look at the buy/sell #'s from retail LAST WEEK and take any of it at face value? I get that this trade, at this point, is complete and total speculation and people need to understand that and mitigate their risk accordingly.

VW was once the most valuable company in the world for this same reason. If the hedge funds can create fear they will destroy the value that retail investors have achieved.... if the retail investors hold onto their positions the lack of supply will drive up prices.

82,GME," So, I get the mechanics argument.  It isn't unreasonable on its face.  It could turn out to be right, or wrong.  Here is my concern:

Everybody is treating this like some game where everybody follows the rules, and we're in a mate in two situation.  Rules say they have to cover their short, so they'll cover their short, which means buying 100M shares at whatever people want for them.  

However, if everybody was following the rules (including the brokers) then we wouldn't have been short 100M shares in the first place.  

Also, maybe GME and their brokers can come up with shares out of nowhere to sell, but only the Federal Reserve can come up with cash out of nowhere.  Maybe the hedge funds are supposed to buy 100M shares for $10k/share or whatever, but that costs $1T, and they don't have $1T.  They'd probably struggle to cover $100/share.

So, if you want an endgame where somebody buys your shares for more than $100 you have to have a theory for where that money actually comes from.  The hedge funds will just declare bankruptcy.  Unless you can pierce the veil you can't get at the billionaires who invested in the fund - they can't lose more than what they put up.  The brokers don't have that kind of money lying around either - not their own money at least.  They play these games with other people's money, which is half the problem.

So, the only way people are getting hundreds of dollars per share is if there is some kind of government bailout.  Maybe people deserve one but I just don't see it happening.  Even in 08 the government didn't hand out money without strings.  Maybe there will be some form you can fill out to ask to get your original share purchase price back with no return, or maybe with a small loss to teach you a lesson.  Who knows.

You can't rely on market mechanics to make your money when the mechanics are broken.  The funds and their brokers wrote a check they can't cash, and just waving around that check isn't going to make the cash appear out of nowhere.",rich000,19,/r/investing/comments/la3bft/emotional_involvement_has_never_been_this_high/gllmzij/,0.076,0.848,0.076,-0.6561

But I come from a very proud working class blue collar family. My whole life I've been taught that what you earn is a direct correlation to how tired your muscles are at the end of the day. Like literally a y=x plot, you work double the hours, or are lifting double the weight of lumber or whatever, that's what makes a hard worker that deserves more. I don't think the word ""stock"" or ""investment"" was uttered a single time in my house.

Now I know intellectually that following this procedure is the most surefire way for an average person to grow wealth with the most generally acceptable level of risk.

Other than the ""us vs them"" narrative (which, remember, came *after* the extraordinary pump due to a value thesis and a short squeeze thesis), almost every single asset bubble fits this narrative. People *always* have an outsized emotional response to asset bubbles.

People lose sight of fundamentals because they're desperate for returns -> foam at the mouth to drive up asset prices with an infinite risk appetite -> justify their reasoning with ""it's different this time,"" ""it's already had great returns, the returns will continue,"" etc -> lose their shirts when it crashes because they had no risk management practices in place.

People think ""it's different this time"" *every* time. Same thing goes for bull markets - ""oh, we're never going to have another recession at this rate,"" yet another recession always manages to pop up. Man, if I had a nickel for every person in late 2019 that said that the US economy was immune to any recession, ever again, since ""it's different this time"" compared to 2008, 2000, early 90s, 80s, I'd be a millionaire.

Just look at any recent economic bubble. Gamestop is the same thing, albeit on a (currently) smaller scale. It's probably a symptom that we're near the top of a bull market again, but that's outside the range of this discussion.

Dot-com bubble - ""Dot-coms are fundamentally changing the landscape of ecommerce, there's no risk!""

Pre-2008 real estate mania - ""everyone has to live in a house, there's no risk!""

2017 Bitcoin bubble - ""it's the future of spending, there's no risk!""

170,EV," gasoline is used for far more than just cars.  only 26% of oil usage goes towards passenger vehicles.  Of that only 23% of passenger vehicles are sedans.  Which is the only thing electric does right this second.

So even if every single sedan was replaced tomorrow with an EV you're still only talking 5 million bbl/day at most.

Also forget that by 2035 they are expecting a massive increase of passenger vehicles that will not automatically be EV... Especially when the trend for nations with a growing middle class is SUV and Trucks..

210,EV," Noticed some typos in the first write up. Sorry, on my phone!

To explain what I mean by valuations barely moving, take for instance $NMCI which was $0.80 in September and had about 35 shares outstanding, so that’s a market cap of $28M. They also had net debt of around $220M. So that means enterprise value or “EV” was about $250M. 

Back then a reasonable projection for EBITDA in 2021 would have been like $40-$50M.

So it was trading around 5x EV/EBITDA.

Now the stock is like $5/sh, but they repurchased some shares so it’s about 32M outstanding, so $160M market cap. But the net debt will be closer to $150M later this year due to enormous cash generation. So now EV is $310M.

248,LMT," I appreciate the response, and the fact that you clearly read it. Thank you! 

You're not peeing in my cheerios, it was a little tongue and cheek, hence pointing out that I did so arbitrarily. Really my point was to show that valuations based on multiples are not super useful, but if we want to use them then LMT is grossly under valued because it is already performing. 

I also think that it is really important to key in on the part of the earnings call where the ceo commented on vertical integration of space tech. That will be huge for margins and definitely justify a better multiple than current industry standard in my view. 


On your point about the government not paying up... I don't think that is realistically in line with the strategic direction of the current administration. There is definitely a vibe of modernize the force so we don't need to expand personnel to compete in a near peer conflict.

249,AXON," Two sides to this. 

One, that risk is accounted for to some extent. The US (where LMT does the vast majority of its business) has been talking about getting out of the Middle East since basically 2004. Obama in 2008 ran and scored major political points by pointing to his his vocal opposition of invading Iraq. Trump talked about getting troops out of the Middle East. It doesn't seem like we are getting out of this quagmire soon despite popular dislike of the war. Most of the contracts LMT has are with individual agencies, departments, etc. So a wide defunding of ""the military"" would involve untangling a nest of different obligations and various budget cuts. This would not only take a lot of time, it would be incredibly difficult. What about something like the parks service using drones to track animals of forest fires? So I would think 

Second, there is a growing vocal dislike of policing, and to some extent the technology and militarization of police that can spill over into defense more glovally.

I think that the USFG has no interest in expanding military size in terms of personnel, but they absolutely have a vested interested in maintaining hegemony. If not expanding scope of personnel, the only way to do this is to out pace competition from a modernization perspective. 

I also think that they are shifting focus toward the aspects of military funding that has expanding budgets, and are doing so more strategically than other contractors. I really feel like LMT is best in breed to address the concern you highlight in point two.

288,AMD," Copying from my post in another thread a few days ago:

> This was a really great earnings, and I think it easily justifies AMD's price. If you ignore the tax benefit, their EPS is $1.08, which would put their P/E TTM at 82, not >125. Guidance of 37% increase in revenue for 2021, which translates to ~$6bn gross profit for next year. Assuming similar proportional increases in R&D and marketing as last year (which tbh I think is relatively conservative, I think it'd be closer to the absolute increases in operating expenses), we're looking at a total of $3.8bn on R&D and marketing, making for an EBITDA of $2.2bn, an increase of over 70%. That'd make the forward EPS of ~$1.8, forward P/E of 50. I think this is a conservative estimate, but AMD always at least match their guidance.

I've been long on AMD for a while. I'm always a bit taken aback by these AMD threads. It's been a great purchase for a long time.

289,TTM," Copying from my post in another thread a few days ago:

> This was a really great earnings, and I think it easily justifies AMD's price. If you ignore the tax benefit, their EPS is $1.08, which would put their P/E TTM at 82, not >125. Guidance of 37% increase in revenue for 2021, which translates to ~$6bn gross profit for next year. Assuming similar proportional increases in R&D and marketing as last year (which tbh I think is relatively conservative, I think it'd be closer to the absolute increases in operating expenses), we're looking at a total of $3.8bn on R&D and marketing, making for an EBITDA of $2.2bn, an increase of over 70%. That'd make the forward EPS of ~$1.8, forward P/E of 50. I think this is a conservative estimate, but AMD always at least match their guidance.

I've been long on AMD for a while. I'm always a bit taken aback by these AMD threads. It's been a great purchase for a long time.

Also their acquisition of Xilinx could be a huge bump for them (closing at end of 2021) expanding into the embedded systems domain.  if they keep up the pressure they will surpass intel’s weak performance and “next gen chips that aren’t much of an improvement”.

I think AMD can (note, not *will*, but has the potential to) equal or exceed Nvidia within 5 years. Their rastorization performance is basically on par with Nvidia right now from what I remember, now they just need to figure out ray tracing and a DLSS equivalent (which they are going to add to current gen cards in the future, if they haven't already).

I think that HFs exited their positions (or at least mitigated them) before Wednesday last week. All the data that people are using to justify the short volume is outdated. At some point this week (maybe tomorrow?) I believe that new short data is supposed to be released, and if it doesn’t line up with the common assumptions, I think it will be a mad dash for the door.

337,AAL," Hi All. - appreciate any thoughts here. I cashed out of GameStop last week and have let the dust settle a bit. All in all, I made 440k on a 67k balance to bring my total taxable and Roth balance to 505k. I fully realize this was a once in a lifetime trade and could have gone sideways - I’m not looking for more investments like that (no meme stocks). That said, this nest egg is what I’m trying to grow. I’ve read a lot about ARK ETFs and bought about 200k in that, as well as some AAPL, EXPE, and AAL today, so am looking to invest the remains 300k. I’m 33, my wife and I have gross income of around 350k and we max out 401k and I nearly max out after tax contributions that I then roll to a Roth. Any advice on how you would allocate assets would be great. No debt besides mortgage. I don’t plan to need the money in the near term as we have net savings with our monthly pay after the deductions mentioned. Also contributing to 529s of 1,000 per month already.

So I bought in with $200 last week and opened a Fidelity account so that I could learn about trading.

I thought I'd buy a few shares and just hold on to them and see what happened, learning along the way. I bought a few shares of a cheap stocks that have popular around here recently.

I must have some fundamental misunderstandings of the details of these transactions and how they relate to account value though because despite the fact that my stocks have net increased in value my account value has dropped by about a third.

I forget exactly how much but like $180 in AMC and $20 in NOK

I've noticed this weekend that in my positions I have my shares of AMC and BB as well as 200 $1 shares in the SPAXX, or my core position. It appears that I have about $200 EXTRA dollars out of nowhere, sitting in my core position.

+200 SPAXX, which is where my money is held until I invest it, but I thought I already had, and by all appearances indeed had.

So the current value of my account starts at >$400, and then theres this cash debt which I assume is unsettled purchases that is just under $300. (My total purchases, if unsettled, add to just under $200.)

The possible explanation could be in the most recent activity today: I have $100 of journaled cash as a debt on the account. I don't know what this means though.

-296 Cash Debt (equals sum of all my purchase transactions minus $100 journaled cash)

Anyway, with all this my account sits at about 60% of my original value despite the fact that my holdings have net increased in value.

So if someone could help me understand how these transactions are cataloged, why SPAXX seems to be holding all my value and I'm trading something else, what journaled cash is, and anything else you may have to say about I'd be so incredibly grateful.

* How old are you? What country do you live in?
   * Im 20 I live in the UK, London. 
* Are you employed/making income? How much?
   * Im a student and I have no income. I recently got 8,500 pounds that I want to invest and grow. 
* What are your objectives with this money? (Buy a house? Retirement savings?)
   * I just want to learn about investing and learn how to grow this money. I have recently created a [capital.com](https://capital.com) account. I bought 3 stocks of GME already so I know how to buy and sell stocks to some extent. I want to learn how to invest this money in the long run though, preferably using a somewhat safe and long term strategy. 
* What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs?
   * I don't need the 8,500 pounds for anything, my rent and bills and tuition are paid. I literally just want to learn how to invest in the stock market. 
* What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know its 100% safe?)
   * I would say like 75% safe. I don't mind losing some money however I would like to see this money grow even if its slow. Eventually as a I gain more experience and understanding of the stock market I would like to take bigger risks. At this point though I just want to learn how it works without much risk. 
* What are you current holdings? (Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors? Any other assets?)
   * I currently hold 3 GME stocks, but I have no idea what I'm doing I just bought them because everyone was telling me to buy and hold. 
* Any big debts (include interest rate) or expenses?
   * No debts 

Basically if anyone could recommend a beginner course or a book that helped you when you were starting out that would be great. Im a total beginner and so any resource you could recommend would be greatly appreciated.

* How old are you? What country do you live in?
   * Im 20 I live in the UK, London. 
* Are you employed/making income? How much?
   * Im a student and I have no income. I recently got 8,500 pounds that I want to invest and grow. 
* What are your objectives with this money? (Buy a house? Retirement savings?)
   * I just want to learn about investing and learn how to grow this money. I have recently created a [capital.com](https://capital.com) account. I bought 3 stocks of GME already so I know how to buy and sell stocks to some extent. I want to learn how to invest this money in the long run though, preferably using a somewhat safe and long term strategy. 
* What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs?
   * I don't need the 8,500 pounds for anything, my rent and bills and tuition are paid. I literally just want to learn how to invest in the stock market. 
* What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know its 100% safe?)
   * I would say like 75% safe. I don't mind losing some money however I would like to see this money grow even if its slow. Eventually as a I gain more experience and understanding of the stock market I would like to take bigger risks. At this point though I just want to learn how it works without much risk. 
* What are you current holdings? (Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors? Any other assets?)
   * I currently hold 3 GME stocks, but I have no idea what I'm doing I just bought them because everyone was telling me to buy and hold. 
* Any big debts (include interest rate) or expenses?
   * No debts 

Basically if anyone could recommend a beginner course or a book that helped you when you were starting out that would be great. Im a total beginner and so any resource you could recommend would be greatly appreciated.

I am just a poor uni student currently working as an intern and I'm trying to save up a little nest egg for myself. I don't really want to jump on any bandwagon (I got suckered into buying GME, but I don't even have one full share, so even if it goes to zero I'll be alright) and would prefer to get slower but more consistent gains. 

I read a book called ""A random walk down Wall Street"" and the main takeaway I got from it, is that investing in simple index funds is more or less a foolproof strategy over the long term.

For the past few months I have been paying into a Socially Responsible portfolio using the Nutmeg app (I'm in the UK). I'll attach a table with a list of investments included there. I have a bit of money saved in that account, but since it's essentially just a bunch of ETFs behind a nice app, I was wondering if I would be better off picking just/r/ one or two ETFs myself and just leaving them to do their thing instead.

I have an account on Trading 212 and I was looking at the iShares Core S&P500 USD (CSPX) and the iShares Global Clean Energy (INRG) funds. I'd like to invest in those two with a 75%/25% split. 

Is now a good time to be putting money into those funds? Maybe I would be better sticking with Nutmeg? I'd love to hear your opinions and advice. 

Thank you all in advance!

I want to predict the next stock market crash, I know it's impossible to time it perfectly but I would be glad already if I'm off by a few points. Just to not throw away all my gains from the current bull run we're in since March 2020.

According to management studies the following indicators can help predicting the next crash:

1. Rampant speculation (is happening now when you look at TSLA, GME etc.)
2. Peak valuations (we are as high with the market as a whole as ever)
3. Low interest rates (rates are at rock bottom currently)
4. Low economic growth rates (economy is barely growing because of the COVID pandemic damage)

So these points show that a crash is coming soon, do you agree with that? If not, please educate me.

In case the market is going to crash, how can you time it? It seems that technical analysis and the use of moving averages can help in cutting losses when the market will drop big but with moving averages you're always late in recognizing the drop. Are there any other ways to see it coming?

# Hello, posted earlier but the thread went down, apologies if this is a repeat read for you

I am fairly new to investing independently, fell into the trap of the Devere Sharks and basically was lucky to get out unscathed just before March '20. Didn't lose any money but didn't have any gains after cashing out the policy 9 years early. I do have a chunk of money I can invest in 1 shot with the cashout but i want to tread carefully since I do support a number of family members financially.

I am a 34Y Pakistani, living in UAE (non-taxable country) and started using Interactive Brokers to trade in Nov. Can anyone point me to resources that deal with Taxation on gains with this setup ? Am I liable to pay on gains made since the stocks are listed in the US Exchanges and if so should I instead buy funds listed on other exchanges ?

**Portfolio**

My investments are 70% ETF Stocks (VOO/VTI) and 30% US Bonds Indexes.

Given all the Hype on GME and others, I am thinking of putting some money aside to buy single company stocks (no more than 10%).

388,UK," Hi,

I'm hoping for some advice or at least some replies I can take something away from. Last year I took a stab at some Forex Trading, got caught up in the hype and was eventually scammed and lost a decent amount of cash. I'm not bitter, the life lesson and intro to trading pitfalls will never be forgotten.

Anyway, I'm looking to dip my toe back in, so I'll get to the questions for context

1. 40, live in UK
2. Fully employed, £55k pa
3. Supplement income/pay off mortgage quicker
4. Looking for yearly returns (so 1k pm or 12k pa)
5. I will only seed with what I can afford to lose, I don't mind making leaps based on logic or reasoned probability with the understanding that things might not turn round that way
6. I'm hoping to seed small with 2k, have traded the mains and crosses in forex before
7. No big debts, just mortage, 2k credit card

Where I'm at: I've been looking at going with IG as a platform using MT4. I like instant execution, I like to keep an eye on trades during the day and pull out when I reach what I want from the trade as opposed to surfing until the crest. The aim is to get as close to 12k trading per year to avoid self assessment tax while I'm feeling it out. Long term goals are salary match from trading.

What I'm fearful about: When I was scammed, the big issue was my deposits went into the broker from my bank. And my profts were listed, but I could never withdraw them. I could withdraw up to my initial deposit but never the profit made from the trade (even when requested as a bank wire). Obivously in hindsight this was because the profit was just a way to gain trust from the advisor before wiping me out on margins closeouts. 

Any advice really appreciated :)",Amble09,1,/r/investing/comments/l9zsb6/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gll30d1/,0.051,0.849,0.1,0.9381

Ticker = CSNA3

I'm getting fckd because iron futures are down since December 2020. The reason for this is that a couple steelmakers in China are suffering from low profit margins, (Weak demand, high production costs), some are considering lowering or even cutting production.

The company (CSN) has good financials, but its performance is directly associated with the rise and fall of the commodity, with that said:

Maybe some of your favorite books or youtube pages to follow or sites to read articles from? I just want to make sure that I educate myself as much as possible prior to making decisions on investing my money.

5%: Smallcap US growth (VEXRX)

56%: Big Tech (AAPL/MSFT/AMZN/NFLX/NVDA)

7%: Upcoming companies/sectors (SQ, ROKU, AMD, SPOT) + ARK funds (ARKK, ARKF, ARKG)

2%: Consumer (Costco, VDC)

2%: Speculative sectors (ICLN, LIT, URNM)

3%: Speculative companies

I also have cash equal to about 25% of my invested portfolio. This includes my emergency fund and some cash I plan to use soon (6 months time) to purchase some property in my home country. Still, I think I can invest some 5% of the cash in the next month or two. I talk more about it in point 2.

A bit about me: I’m in my late 20s, work in tech, live in the US, single, no debt. I’m investing for my retirement. I am okay with taking risk on my investments in the sense that I’m holding them for long term, and don’t plan to use any right now. I do have enough cash for emergency expenses (for about 6 months).

Few questions:

1.	Tech heavy nature: Clearly I’m tech heavy. One of the big tech companies listed above is my employer and I have a lot of it in vested RSUs. That one company accounts for about 35-40% of my portfolio. They have all been growing so well that I don’t feel like taking them out. I work in tech and am familiar with the industry, and I believe all these companies are well positioned. (Note that NFLX is probably the riskiest in my mind, I only have about 3% of my portfolio in that). I think they will continue to at least match the market if not beat it in the next couple of years. If I start to see signs that concern at that point I plan to reduce my positions in them (and move to other sectors or VTI). Also these companies are now so big and diversified across multiple sub-industries. Will I regret this?

2.	Diversification into more crash resistant industries: I want to invest the cash I have into non-tech value stocks to diversify. I did some research and zeroed down upon consumer staples and healthcare industries. I’m thinking of going with COSTCO and Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF (to get exposure to PG, PEP, KO, WMT, EL, etc). For healthcare, I’m thinking of JNJ and the Vanguard Healthcare ETF. I’m also planning to pick up BRK/B for its diverse holdings and value nature, and DIS as it seems like a good value position to have. 

3.	My strategy above assumes that consumer staples and healthcare (or large value companies) are a hedge against big tech performing badly. Should I instead consider small cap companies instead to balance big tech?

4.	Bonds: I have nothing in bonds. Should I really be investing in them? Current interest rates makes them pretty unattractive right?

5.	Cash position: I think I’m holding too much cash. I’m hesitant to invest it because I do need that amount in about 6 months time and if the market crashes then I’ll lose. I’d have invested this in bonds but I’m seeing negative interest rate of late?

I also have cash equal to about 25% of my invested portfolio. This includes my emergency fund and some cash I plan to use soon (6 months time) to purchase some property in my home country. Still, I think I can invest some 5% of the cash in the next month or two. I talk more about it in point 2.

A bit about me: I’m in my late 20s, work in tech, live in the US, single, no debt. I’m investing for my retirement. I am okay with taking risk on my investments in the sense that I’m holding them for long term, and don’t plan to use any right now. I do have enough cash for emergency expenses (for about 6 months).

Few questions:

1.	Tech heavy nature: Clearly I’m tech heavy. One of the big tech companies listed above is my employer and I have a lot of it in vested RSUs. That one company accounts for about 35-40% of my portfolio. They have all been growing so well that I don’t feel like taking them out. I work in tech and am familiar with the industry, and I believe all these companies are well positioned. (Note that NFLX is probably the riskiest in my mind, I only have about 3% of my portfolio in that). I think they will continue to at least match the market if not beat it in the next couple of years. If I start to see signs that concern at that point I plan to reduce my positions in them (and move to other sectors or VTI). Also these companies are now so big and diversified across multiple sub-industries. Will I regret this?

2.	Diversification into more crash resistant industries: I want to invest the cash I have into non-tech value stocks to diversify. I did some research and zeroed down upon consumer staples and healthcare industries. I’m thinking of going with COSTCO and Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF (to get exposure to PG, PEP, KO, WMT, EL, etc). For healthcare, I’m thinking of JNJ and the Vanguard Healthcare ETF. I’m also planning to pick up BRK/B for its diverse holdings and value nature, and DIS as it seems like a good value position to have. 

3.	My strategy above assumes that consumer staples and healthcare (or large value companies) are a hedge against big tech performing badly. Should I instead consider small cap companies instead to balance big tech?

4.	Bonds: I have nothing in bonds. Should I really be investing in them? Current interest rates makes them pretty unattractive right?

5.	Cash position: I think I’m holding too much cash. I’m hesitant to invest it because I do need that amount in about 6 months time and if the market crashes then I’ll lose. I’d have invested this in bonds but I’m seeing negative interest rate of late?

It’s my opinion that the media keeps the stock price down by referring to them as an old failed mobile phone company.

I don’t bought into them a long time ago, and added some more when one of their big patent suits was announced closed, when they announced some partnerships, and when the media is finally talking about the company outside of their old mobile business.

482,GME, I would say so. A ladder attack relies on panic selling. With GME you can see large dips right before market close. This is probably the day traders closing their positions as they always do and to drive the close price down so market reports show that GME closed at a lower price than it would have otherwise. I'd call this hype limitation.

Second, there is no 5-10% profits rule about selling stock. If you bought stock in a company and still think the company has room to grow, why would you sell? What if someone bought AAPL in 2016 and decided to sell after making 10%? They would have missed out on more than 400% returns.

Third, make sure you understand the tax implications involved in selling. Depending on your income, there could be a significant difference in how much tax you owe on your profits when you sell. In the US, if you sell after owning for <1 year, you will be taxed as if the money was part of your normal income.

511,AAPL," 1. Mega caps are already at the top, and while they can certainly outperform as they have done this past decade, you have to ask yourself where the future growth is going to come from.  AAPL is already a 2.25T company, can you see them become 5.5T in 5 years to outperform the S&P 500?  You also say you're watching for signs of concern, but it could very well be a slow bleed, and you wouldn't know until after 5 years underperformance.  Not saying that's what will happen - but it's the risk you're taking with a large chunk of your portfolio.

2. What's your reason for looking for ""crash-resistant""?  If you are investing for retirement, presumably 25+ yrs away, why do you care if the market crashes in the next 10 yrs?  The market spends most of its time at ATHs, and in the worst case scenario the great depression took 15 yrs to recover with dividends.  Now, diversification is good and I would highly encourage it, I just think the reasoning is off.  Rather than protection from crashes, the aim should be better risk-adjusted returns.

3. Small cap have underperformed recently and I expect them to do well in the future, so I have a ~7% stake in them and would recommend to others.

4. For your retirement, I would begin to phase in bonds when you are 20-25 yrs away.  At least, that's a moderate approach, you can delay longer if you have a high risk appetite.  Current rates are low but there's no telling how it will look even 5 yrs from now.

589,AMD," I think you underestimated the importance of TSMC. Just think about how many things today's use chips, TVs, cars, computer, data center, phones, cameras. About half of them are from TSMC (based on market share). Now apply the current auto ICs shortage to every sector. That's what will happen if China invades Taiwan. We are not going to see a collapse of TSM, we are going to see a Great Depression. I dont think the western powers will allow that to happen.

Also the fact that TSMC is the largest fab and has the most capacity but is still at full capacity tells you the world needs IC. Apple, AMD along takes away so much of their 5nm and 7nm slot already. The fact that Nvidia didn't produce their rtx3000s in TSMC is actually bullish because TSMC couldn't care less about it to lower its price to compete with Samsung. 

On the topic of Samsung, their fab is the only threat to TSMC. However, it has been shown from time to time that TSMC process is better, in terms of performance and power. Apple once used both TSMC and Samsung to produce one of their iPhone processor. You can Google the result, but basically TSMC wins in every metrics.

Intel on the other hand, is a closed fab meaning they do not produce chips for other companies. They only make their own stuff. So even they figure out their 7nm, it is not a threat to TSMC. On top of that there is no capacity in TSMC for Intel (said TSMC). 

There are many other fabs in Taiwan outside of TSMC. And they are all getting the benefit from TSMC being at full capacity. It will be interesting to see if they can take all those orders in and grow or TSMC will increase its capacity faster.

Other ealier concern is China. It is spending a lot of resources in chip manufacturing. However, this is no long a issue because of US sanctions. ASML and other key equipment manufacturers are not allowed or limited to sell to China. This basically put a chock hold on Chinese fans. Unless they can develop their own equipment, there is no chance for them to catch up to Samsung or TSMC.

Does it get destroyed in the fighting? Is it such a strategic resource that assorted powers destroy the factories to keep them out of China's hands?
> 
> 

I don't think this is likely to happen, but if it did a likely outcome is 
is that the western/US block of countries puts extreme sanctions on China. They basically cannot import or export with any country allied with the US and it sets up a space-race equivalent for semiconductors among other things (which the US is likely to win given a head start despite all the IP stealing of the last couple decades by China). In such a situation China would be left to trade with countries that are either indebted to it or in its sphere of influence, which are mainly poorer countries. Thats probably an outcome that China wants to avoid as well, as a result they are much more likely to continue on their path of stealing IP, poaching talent from TSMC and Samsung and investing in their own R&D and bide their time until they are self-sufficient and on level footing in ""critical technology"" like semis.

598,GME," Dear people of Reddit,

Currently there is  a huge growth stock bubble that has grown to such  ridiculous levels. Investors have taken ""Growth""  too literarily and piling up too much assets which have no proven track records of profitability. The stock market is currently relying on too much assumption that have not yet proven itself. I believe that this will lead to the biggest financial crisis in history.

Take for example two stocks: Tesla and Royal Dutch Shell.

Currently Tesla is being valued at 750 billion dollars while only making 560 million dollars profit for the first time. And to make things worse, these are all profit from selling emission rights. To take things into perspective, would you buy a lemonade stand for 1 million dollars which will only make 750 dollars a year? Absolutely not, (I hope). I know that a lemonade stand is not the same as selling electrics vehicle's obviously, but observing that Tesla is not the only company making them, it kind a resembles just another lemonade stand.

On the other hand, we have Royal Dutch Shell. A company that is really struggling because of the low oil price and corona, but yet, still makes 300 billion in revenue and is currently valued at only 190 billion. Furthermore, it is giving a dividend of more than 5% despite the fact of the pandemic. This company has proven time and time again that it can be profitable in whatever situation. 

The valuations have a lot to do of what is popular right now. The fundamentals are thrown away. Absolutely, you need to look at the far future. But, can you honestly predict what the stock price of our beloved GME will do in the next 5 minutes?

617,HRC," I’m not an expert on corporate real estate so I’d be speaking out of my ass if I gave you a definitive answer on the specific effect of corporate real estate. What I can say is that I think that the overall rise in HRC steel per ton, which is a general product / temperature test for demand, points to there being huge demand that supply won’t ramp up to very quickly. Auto as mentioned as specifically been a big catalyst, but more importantly the tariffs making Chinese steel mostly cost prohibitive are just a very large boost for the foreseeable future. I have specifically seen chatter online about real estate companies expressing concern regarding the price of steel and how it affects their bottom line, but if you think about it, steel is only one small part of their costs. People, benefits, corporate insurance, other ingredients, machinery and maintenance and delivery and financing. Even if steel went up 40%, if it’s only 5-10% of their costs and they’re relatively profitable companies, then the cost increase is more of a dip in their profits than (in my opinion) a really strong factor to cause a crash in steel. Additionally, China uses so much steel that it’s hard for them to have surplus to even export, even if it’s very much in their financial interest to flood market and take out foreign steel competition. I want to emphasize how big of a deal it is that instead of -70 cents per share for this most recent quarter they went up to I think -25 cents or share, that to me shows that with the next at least two quarters we’re going to see steady growth in earnings. If you look at the last time steel was at the 1100ish per ton of HRC steel index, X was at $170 per share, now it’s around 18.5. And we’re back at record highs.

632,JPM," Hi spec\_1, 

I absolutely agree that earnings is the catalyst here. However, my idea was to take a position before earnings are considered a given, while the price is still very low. As the company mention themselves (and they're usually very low-key and objective), I think there's strong indication that revenue will increase in H1 2021 and earnings will appear in H2. Once that happens, the SP will rise very steeply.

My short tracker gives shorting as less than 1% but that's not what actually happens. A lot of shorting is simply not declared. Check out the following info: 

Look at the RNSs for the last year and before.  
[https://www.lse.co.uk/rns/SHI/](https://www.lse.co.uk/rns/SHI/)  


Nearly all Holdings in Company notifications are for JPM shares. JPM shares seem to go up and down every few weeks/months or even every few days -- that's because they lend out shares for shorting and then they receive them back as agreed (that's how shorting is done usually, with borrowed shares)  


See one of the older ones... have a look where it says cash equity swaps, at the bottom of this RNS. These are all shorters who borrowed JPM shares. You'll see that one of them borrowed 12 million shares (about 1% of this company). In total, these shorters borrowed from JPM nearly 3% of their shares.

In a shallow market like SIGs, that 1% by a single shorter or 3% by all of them together, will give the direction.  


Generally speaking, SIG is ideal for shorting because its a shallow market and also because it's a company had problems in the past (creating downward pressure, causing panic occassionally) but also good fundamentals and prospects (so there's also upward pressure).

I think Brexit will have absolutely minimal effect on this company for two reasons: 

1) Brexit has been agreed already and stipulates free movement of good across the channel. For a company like SIG plc, the little extra paperwork involved here is not a major issue at all. 

2) This company is pretty much split across the UK and the continental Europe and that means they have warehouses and suppliers in each country. 

Brexit was a major concern in the past for this company but it's now sorted.

641,EDIT," I would be pretty concerned if I owned any crypto with Robinhood.  If you do own crypto with Robinhood, I would recommend you learn more about what a private key is, and why you need to have it instead of an institution.

Other than crypto, everything else should be insured.

I think the volatility has more to do with what hedge funds are having to do to cover their margin on the shorts.  Friday looked like they had to sell an awful lot of long positions to cover their shorts.  If that is the case, I would expect volatility to keep ramping up.

(I could be wrong though, I'm a complete moron and this is not financial advice)

EDIT to add:  

Another thing on my mind, is how long can their investors keep forking over billions?  And how many billions do you want to put into a business that has asked you for more money than ever before in the last week?  

What if that business just burned the bridge on over 50% of its users?
