$SVAD - Started filing yesterday, I expect continued volume today.

$APTY - This is a play similar to AABB which ran to 65 cents.

$SAPX - This thing is just warming up.

$EVIO - I'm just waiting for this to take off.

$EFIR - Called this the other day. New structure ran this up 70% today, sorry if you missed it.

$QEDN - Filings coming soon. These boys are in talks with Nestle and Purina with a lot of other big companies looking at them. This is a super-food play. Nutrition and all that.

$EEGI - Filings coming soon.

$NWGC - Filings coming soon, ran 25% in the last trading hour yesterday.

$RSHN - This play is up a lot already, you need to have diamond nuts to buy this.

BONUS:

TRCH - Zero shares left to short. Crazy volume. Jun 22 cutoff for benefits. Merger coming shortly after.

TAWNF - Restructuring plan vote passed. Court meeting passed. New CEO. New revenue streams ie Star Alliance & Thai Smile. People slept on this today, I don't think they realize what's going on.

LOTTERY:

HGYN - This is a play based on 100% speculation. I'm not yet convinced it is Hoyo Logistics, but if it is, you can retire. This play is RISKY AF. You've been warned.

EDIT:

BOYS! I almost forgot. $MDCN has appointed a new CEO (Xavier Mitchell) as of the 14th. This thing is still in trips and ticker change will be coming soon to reflect the change to Immediate Properties. This is an easy 2x play, imo.
