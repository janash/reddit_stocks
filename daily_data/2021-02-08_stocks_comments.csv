66,BB," Agree on BB. I've used QNX on HRT systems, and it's outstanding. It's used in a lot of show entertainment systems (think cirque, water fountains, motion bases).

But, for BB to compete in the auto space, which is its new strategy bar none, they just can't compete with the FAANGs which each has an in-house (aka M&A) solution. And considering the big 9 OEMS (GM, Toyo, VW, etc..) are hard set on some cloud solution--BB is playing catch up.

I believe AMD are going to really bring by the fight to intel their as their EPYC range continues to increase in power and features. Plus with their now competitive GPU architecture, if they make some good moves into the ML space then it’s a really good sign.

AMD atm are being held back by the fact they rely on TMC to produce their chips which is causing stock supplies. 

Potential for a really big increase in market share and I’m confident they’ll do it. I think Lisa Su is one of the best tech CEOs out there. For her it’s all about the product and letting that do the talking. Very similar to Job’s ethos.

136,AMC," To answer your questions:

**Would it be a good idea to invest before this happens(if it does)?**

Yes, mergers or buy-outs will (nearly) always make the stock of the weaker company increase in value.

**Or would AMC stock forfeit?**

No, if a company is bought and gets consumed by the buyer i.e. AMC ceases to exist and becomes 'Netflix Cinema', they will have an agreement in place to value each share at a certain amount. So, if AMC is trading at say $7 a share, Netflix might offer $8 a share. As such the shareholder has each unit of stock converted to $8 cash and deposited into their account.

**Side note:**

Should probably add that in some cases even though the company is bought it still continues under its own name and management rather than being engulfed.

I actually think Netflix would benefit from owning theatres. They could use them basically as marketing tools for their movies/series, allow their subscribers to view their  Netflix movies for free and make extra money from them by selling food and generate extra income by selling discounted tickets to some of their main movies (like the ones that run for Oscars) to non-subs.

Plus AMC as a whole is peanuts in term of market cap. Netflix doesn't even need their theatres to turn big profits.

AMC still carries a big risk, so the price is somewhat justified if you factor that in. Also, don't forget the shorts draggin the price down in the past also the rise of streaming freenzy for new services in 2018-2019 combined with lower revenue that smashed the price to around 10$. But a lot of people miss old-school movie theaters, moreover after pandemic forced them to stay indoors

You add an extra at your Amazon prime, you only buy it if you want. Together with prime is discount, by itself a bit more expensive. Comes in 2 options, 2 or family option.

You can also sync, for example a marathon with Star Wars before the new star wars comes out ( Disney, I know, but you get the point, you use some event).

211,BL," I’ll do you one better. Let’s think through how to pick a long hold. 

1) What is a current problem with no real solution? A few years back oil was trading at well over 100/bbl and gas prices were intolerable yet there was no alternative.  A decade later your hypothetical green energy portfolio is likely doing pretty well.  

2) If there are possible investments in probable solutions to the problems you see, of those how many have common equity?  How much equity have they already sold?  Lower sold equity is better (several reasons for this).  How’s the R&D budget vs enterprise value?  If they’re solving problems they better be inventing, right?

3) So you have a few picks.  They’re solving problems you feel are real problems and they’re investing heavily into novel solutions.  How do you weight those picks? Recall #1: sure your Tesla investment blew up but several of your other no-names are still no-names.  For this you have dig deep. Look at the LinkedIn profiles for upper management.  See who’s running things, which departments, where they came from, past accomplishments, education, etc.  Take no detail for granted.   Finally, rank your picks by their general management score.  Little art little science in this. From there divvy out your money how you see fit.  If you did the diligence to this point correctly you have an intimate idea about which companies you like best.  

4) Looking for high growth unknown names is hard.  Markowitz and BL won’t help here because the data and assumption are too volatile.  If you’re looking at mid caps you can attempt PCA but keep in mind that price breakthroughs typically align with business breakthroughs and price data alone won’t give you the answer.  Train your mind to look for alternative data.

230,EV," Look at the trends and think big picture/long-term.

Look into companies who are thinking about or currently transitioning into a more modern business model.

Not growth stocks but as examples; Walmart and Disney.

Walmart unveiled their Walmart+ in 2020, a new feature that is nearly identical to Amazon Prime. It's clear to me that Walmart and Amazon will be direct competitors for a very long time and the only difference is Amazon is trading at 3300 with a 1.7T market cap and Walmart is around 140 and only 400B. Amazon has more avenues of business than Walmart but over 10 years that gap will close quite a bit.

Disney is the other one that comes to mind. 2020 was horrible for the parks, having to be closed most of the year. Instead of losing money for the entire year, they launched Disney+ at the end of 2019 and put a major focus into the brand in 2020. To me it's very clear cable providers are going bankrupt and in 10 years every channel will be streamed digitally. Disney stepped up their game by testing the waters with streamed movies for purchase as well, since theatres were also closed. This model has a ton of potential and I see it becoming the default way to consume television and movies (even more so than Netflix/Hulu do now)

This gives me a unique insight into what companies in the data center arena are most prevalent, which ones are irrelevant and it aligns with my own interests. I find this is key as im not only motivated to do my DD on these companies but I can see in real time how well they are doing.

312,HR," \-----$FVRR-----A diamond in rough in plain sight

Fiverr is a site for **freelancers to offer their work online**. That's a very simple statement, it's doesn't seem to offer groundbreaking value like a tech plays and at first glance, it doesn't seem to offer any reasoning why you should invest, bear with me and listen. I'll just outline a few reasons why Fiverr has been an extremely undervalued case an worthy of your investment:

(1) Fiverr has been extremely undervalued and **mispriced by at least half the Wall-street Analysts**, save for a few top ones, and its seems to be glossed over by many investors out there due to a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of the business. Even the top Wall Street analysts on buy ratings seem to have glossed over the most important reasoning to buy the stock. (As a side note, please note that the stock has **grown over 700%** in the past year.)

It is fundamentally, a **groundbreaking new Human Resources solution for SMEs**. It allows a marketplace for SMEs to find value talent, that would be impossible for them to source, both due to geographical and limited budgets. Say, if I run my business in a small town, how can I find talent to do my artwork for my advertisement? Fiverr provides me with the solution by offering ,say, extremely talented individuals half way across the world in less developed countries for one-tenth of the price. To be blunt, it allows SMEs to source talented individuals in less developed countries for a value play.

(2) **Fiver has close to 0 true competitors in this space**. Their so-called closest competitor 'Upwork' are targeted towards different markets. Upwork is geared towards at the higher end of the market at large corporates while Fiverr is geared towards SMEs. If you look at the way the platform is set up, they charge a much higher rate and the focus is on more complex projects. I believe there is much more talent on Fiverr that is drawn across countries and geographies which would otherwise be very very difficult to access for SMEs.

To summarize, the Fiverr platform seems to shift **whole industries** online to provide value talent which would otherwise be extreme pain points for SMEs. **In short, this is the Alibaba of HR solutions for talent sourcing.**

(3) Now, lets talk about the valuation. Fiverr is currently valued at approximately, 9 billion market cap, with 35 million shares and 20 million on float. It's at the time of writing, at $270. If you look at similar comparable, such as Etsy, both sites that offer work online, it is worth 27 billion. That's three times the market cap of Fiverr. In fact, I argue that Fiverr has a potentially larger market size than Etsy, the website offers work across a range of industries, from computing, all the way to advertising. **That's potentially a 300%+ return** if you are looking at a long term investment.

(4) Why its good to get in now. If you look at the amount of Fiverr stock Hedge funds have in their portfolio, a lot of them have none. There are a just a few hedge-funds with Fiverr in their portfolio (last time I check there were around \~10) and this has given them outsized gains. It doesn't help the fact that half the Wall Street analyst think that Fiverr is ""just"" a platform offering remote work opportunities and its only gaining steam now because of the coronavirus. That's fundamentally a mis-analysis in the true value of Fiverr.

(5) As a user of avid user of Fiverr myself, some people ask if you want to de-platform and deal with the sellers off platform. That's a big risk. Many times you are dealing with people half way across the world in places, and Fiverr gives great protection for the buyer if they don't meet quality standards, deadlines you've set etc. I've had a few cases where the seller wasn't producing the quality as expected and I got my money back 100%. I've used many platforms that don't hold your money in escrow and ask you to transfer money to the buyer in places like India. Got scammed before and not worth the hassle.",mlsbbe,8,/r/stocks/comments/lf0u6c/if_you_had_to_pick_one_growth_stock_for_the_next/gmkb0dg/,0.024,0.844,0.132,0.9968

Worst case you still have a stock you believe has long term potential and no reddit price bump.

That said, I've heard $PLTR around WSB a lot so I'm keeping a very close eye on it in the event of a pump n dump, in which case I'll take some of their hype gains early on and then cash out until it cools off (if I even decide at that point it's worth getting back in). WSB isn't good for long term investing, but if you're already in on something they pick up and circle jerk then you can just ride their rollercoaster and get off early when things start getting really out of hand.

Lion I think is a much better business than SoFi and the Amazon order is super promising. I just don't agree that building from scratch is any type of competitive advantage that places their product above Arrival, Workhorse, Canoo or any number of any other potential startups. I think the Workhorse/USPS story is a pretty stark reminder that these types of companies are stuck in a loop of needing to win big contracts to scale but can't win big contracts because they're not big enough.

If this is long term hold, why not allocate to a split of total stock and some foreign, or emerging markets, or something somewhat normal? Something with a lower fee too. I understand they hype around certain sectors like EV, biology, etc., but nothing has fundamentally changed to warrant the massive increase in value other than oil tanking due to Covid (again no fundamental changes, just demand drop, and the price is nearing $60), and a new administration which will likely invest in some newer energy projects.

Edit: everyone seems to be hyping ARKG. What happened since March of last year that brought the massive growth of biotech? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. I’m a scientist, nothing changed for me.

You are talking about growth vs value investing. Sometimes the best picks are extremely obscure and seem nonsensical at the time.

Exxon on the other hand is eventually doomed if it remains on course, and doesnt innovate or turnaround.

Exxon is still however valuable for the forseeable decade, at least because it will still make lots of money after the covid recovery. Investors now are investing a lot into the underavalued aspects and for its dividend.

Carnival cruises is another case of undervalued. Carnival is not at risk at bankruptcy and when it recovers will deliver a large return to investors from these price levels. It also offers a large dividend for its current price. 

Exxon and carnival are not about whether they will exceed their old highs, its about returning to somewhat close to their old highs, when they regain their footing. If you combine this with the high dividend yields and reinvested them they could easily come close to doubling after the recovery.

Talking about the other side of the argument, not about the ""dead beat"" companies but about the companies of ""tomorrow"", many of these companies are at historically high p/e ratios and also trading above the intrinsic values from their cash flows. Combined with a possibility of interest rates rising due to possible high inflations, a real estate bubble burst, and a highly damaged global economy and a larger GDP decrease than 2008, the current overvalued sectors of ""tomorrow"" may not appeal to some.

428,GDP," The 3 examples you stated both have several reasons why they may go up. I invest in anything I think can increase in value. I wrote an expansive GME DD at $35 then warned against the price fall on monday before market open. Check my post history. I also have bought tesla and palantir shares when they are objectively overvalued. Disclosure, I currently hold positions in BP, Rolls Royce and Carnival.

You are talking about growth vs value investing. Sometimes the best picks are extremely obscure and seem nonsensical at the time. Rolls royce for example might survive the current pile of debt and exit this as a more efficient company with a new chairman, and a new focus on sustainable aviation fuels and nuclear space exploration. Rolls royce is not neccessarily NOT a company of tomorrow. It is priced lower because of fears of bankruptcy. Only time can tell if this will happen. However agreements and contracts signed the last few months with the british goverment, space agency and the american navy amounting to hundreds of millions show that they probably have confidence in its recovery, so I also do. I have also done expansive DD on rolls royces products, services, buisness models, valuation and outlook which I may write a post on.

Exxon on the other hand is eventually doomed if it remains on course, and doesnt innovate or turnaround. BP on the other hand is priced lower comparitively to exxon due to skepticism to its clean energy turnaround. BP is trying to pivot and its recent massive project for irish sea windfarms is quite bullish. Exxon is still however valuable for the forseeable decade, at least because it will still make lots of money after the covid recovery. Investors now are investing a lot into the underavalued aspects and for its dividend.

Carnival cruises is another case of undervalued. Carnival is not at risk at bankruptcy and when it recovers will deliver a large return to investors from these price levels. It also offers a large dividend for its current price. 

Exxon and carnival are not about whether they will exceed their old highs, its about returning to somewhat close to their old highs, when they regain their footing. If you combine this with the high dividend yields and reinvested them they could easily come close to doubling after the recovery.

Talking about the other side of the argument, not about the ""dead beat"" companies but about the companies of ""tomorrow"", many of these companies are at historically high p/e ratios and also trading above the intrinsic values from their cash flows.

But that might not happen in any close future, let say a year from now. Minimum. But then again that's my opinion. That company survived some bigger world shits than they did recently so there is no assumption why it wouldnt again.

* AI is obvious, it's being used in self driving cars, machine learning algorithms, science, big data and many other things.

* Robotics is obvious, studies show that by 2030 up to 20million currently manned jobs will go to robots. The US has already lost 60million jobs to robots.

* Space is obvious, it's the final frontier and our only hope of becoming a multi-planetary species.

* Genomics is obvious, medicine is always improves and we're always going to want to extend human life. Also throw in bio-implants, limb replacement etc. 

* 3D printing is obvious, it's far cheaper than traditional manufacturing and the things you can do with it are essentially endless.

* Next gen internet, this can be a bit hard to point down because it's basically the next generation of internet companies and don't fit into a specific category but think 5G, wireless communication, IoT, chips, graphics processors, fintech etc.

VYM comes to mind as a good dividend ETF. Low fees and >3% dividend. I use it for my Roth IRA that I can't contribute to any longer. It has been sub par relative to S&P 500 since around 2017 because the S&P has become dominated by non dividend paying companies.

Graphite is used to create anodes, which are one of the most important components of lithium batteries. Something like 60%+ of the graphite production in the world comes from China, who charges an arm and a leg for it before shipping it halfway across the world. Noveau Monde could potentially cut a lot of that out by manufacturing anodes of the same quality right next door to the US, and they are (imo) the most promising of all the Canadian graphite mining companies. Their CEO is also hilarious and they've posted a bunch of pretty great ads on youtube, and a lot of their higher ups have invested heavily in the stock of the company, which I have read is always a good sign.

I see you're working on getting them from unclaimed property from Delaware. once you do that you will need to call Computershare as mentioned above.

After that you should open a brokerage at the platform of your choice, you can then request Computershare to have the shares transferred to that brokerage. They will walk you through this but you will likely need a lot of paperwork and a medallion signature from a bank. You may need to send them your shares too.

Once you get them into a brokerage you will also likely want to talk to a tax professional about what the tax burden is going to be because the gains will potentially be significant over that time. You'll probably need the date they were purchase and then can do a blended cost basis + long term gains taxes for when you do eventually sell.

680,AMC," I will give you a short run down, an important disclaimer is that I don't have too much knowledge about the theater business itself, so I will be talking about AMC in general terms. The following DD is based on simple assumptions, I haven't looked at the company's financial reports in-depth or used any mathematical models to forecast future cashflows.

Short-term: your hope is for GME to spike. AMC is following the stock movement of GME because both have a lot of common interest due to r/wsb. If GME sees another boost, even if for a day or a couple of hours, it can be your chance to get out. If GME doesn't spike, AMC is very unlikely to do so.

Long-term: let's assume that AMC will be able to operate like it used to before Covid19. Q4 2019, AMC was sitting around 8 dollars. Q3 looked better for the company where the price sat around 10. Q1-Q2 it sat around 14. You go back to 2018 it was higher. You look at 5 years, it is a downtrend. Now let's assume the price was around 12 during 2019 and that AMC could reach those heights again in 2021 after covid is done. Realistic? The answer is no. Why? dilution. AMC had 100 million shares during the start of 2020, now it has 400 million because AMC needed to raise money. It means that the company needs 4 times the amount of revenue that they had in 2019 to achieve the same evaluation and thus the same stock price which would be around 12. That obviously won't happen because regardless of what AMC does to improve performance, it won't be able to increase its' revenue 4x.

Any more factors to consider? AMC still has massive debt and will operate in an industry with ever more focus on streaming.

Conclusion: as far as long-term sentiment goes I actually don't think the fundementals are on the company's side. Even if we assume that the company can go back to its' previous performance pre- covid19 it should still be priced way lower because of the dilution of their stocks. If we assume a price target of 12 (2019 performance and the amount of shares), it means that with the amount of shares that exist now (400 compared to 100 in 2019), the company will only be worth 3 dollars. Simplistic look, but something to keep in mind.

I think the best chance of AMC having a spike is for its' price to go up because of GameStop or because of emotional investing after covid19 is over. I can see some people buying the stock without understanding the fundementals because they think ''well, it will surely go back to 15-20 now that the pandemic is over''.

683,AMC," Same position here. Bought 100 @ 13.25 average. Tanked next day. I keep telling myself that it'll bounce back organically on earnings when things reopen. But honestly, the unfortunate truth is that AMC did a share dilution to raise money to stave off bankruptcy, so it would have to be 2x more profitable than it was pre-pandemic to get the stock price back to pre-covid levels. Also, this is a $2 stock right now. If that wasn't enough, I also think exclusive movie release to theaters may eventually be a thing of the past, seeing how many movies were released to streaming platforms (Trolls 2, Mulan, etc).

If you bought at $15.85, what made you consider the stock was worth that? 

What's changed within the month that no longer makes that worthwhile? 

If you bought in on hype and you're hoping for profit within a few weeks, investing in stocks may not be the best approach for you.

If it helps your LuLu decision I’m not saying buy but it’s lower than it’s been for a while so if there’s a ‘dip’ to buy it’s going to be now. I’m not a financial adviser and I have no position on LULU because I don’t think I’m in the wealth bracket to leverage on it right now but if you have money you want to put down as a long position and grow they’ve done absolutely fine growth (on their stock value, I haven’t checked their financials) even this year with brick and mortar retail closed so they will likely see a boom when people have been vaccinated and gyms/yoga studios reopen.

- excellent management, difficult to quantify but look at track record of exceeding earnings/cash guidance. Doesn’t matter if earnings are bad, they just have to exceed management promises.

Palantir is expected to make about 1.07 Billion in 2020. I don’t generally like companies in IT that are valued > 40 times their sales, and Palantir is valued at about 45 times projected sales. This is a company that has been around for almost two decades and is just now generating a Billion in sales.

Also, while I understand that it would be disingenuous to label Palantir as only a defense contractor, it is a lot of what they do, and the pace of government contracting is extremely stagnant right now. 

The last reason for me is the valuation. (I’m honestly less bearish on bad evaluations than a lot of folks, but it still was somewhat of a factor for me). Their valuation of 62 Billion is laughably high at this point.

857,AI," You can look at growth or capital appreciation managed mutual funds and scan their largest holdings or breakdown their holdings by industry. That gives you a sense of what the broad institutional outlook is. So look at what those funds are for Vanguard, Blackrock, etc every couple of months. And just following the market generally and applying your decision making process.

If you think the market is growing then the time is sell is when that growth stops, or you think there's some adverse event coming, or there's substantially higher return offered by another market, or one that is growing but has been derisked.

So same return for lower risk is also worth rotating out. So there's some big new market or tech being tapped and initial regulatory hurdles have been passed and you know top people in management are providing some kind of vetting.

For the declining growth, think of it in terms of 'are they consistently reinvesting their revenue?"" Or are they stockpiling cash beyond what's enough to weather a few quarters or 'rainy day' amounts. Or 'how close do you think they are to declaring a dividend""? And how much time and faith do investors have in that.

For ETFs specifically, a lot of these companies may still be growing. Even Apple, which is the most prominent example I can think of in terms of scrutiny regarding continued innovation and growth vs stockpiling cash, seems to be talking about moving into the EV market. A lot of oil companies are looking into other types of energy, old auto companies are looking into EV. So it just depends on if you believe their leadership, forward looking statements etc. And these fund managers (if it's not an index ETF) will review the portfolio companies at least annually and adjust their growth predictions, so they'll actually take out the underperformers for you if they no longer meet the prospectus criteria, if it's actively managed.

Even Apple, which is the most prominent example I can think of in terms of scrutiny regarding continued innovation and growth vs stockpiling cash, seems to be talking about moving into the EV market. A lot of oil companies are looking into other types of energy, old auto companies are looking into EV. So it just depends on if you believe their leadership, forward looking statements etc. And these fund managers (if it's not an index ETF) will review the portfolio companies at least annually and adjust their growth predictions, so they'll actually take out the underperformers for you if they no longer meet the prospectus criteria, if it's actively managed. 

For some of the new innovation funds like ARK we may not really know much about the latter stages of those growth cycles. Genomics, decentralized finance, AI, robotics etc.",BannerlordAdmirer,1,/r/stocks/comments/lfecj0/how_to_know_when_to_sell_a_long_term_hold/gmlcioe/,0.032,0.835,0.132,0.9887

895,MSCI," Not a financial advisor:

That entirely depends on your goals and outlook. If you have around 15+ years  and index like VTI, SPY or MSCI World would make sense.

I am very sceptical of ARK due to them being overly investing in un - or barely profitable companies that will do absolutely terrible in a market downturn (check Janus stocks from the dot com era).

If you need the money in the near future for example to buy a house, car or go to university  -  a pure stock ETF isn't great. There can always be a crash (and you never know when) so something like the All Weather Portfolio from ray Dalio would be better. The All-Weather Portfolio won't return 30% a year -  which might be the case with an all stock portfolio - but it won't crash 50% a year either. So while it might not give as much return as an equity portfolio it is far safer.

&#x200B;

The All Weather Portfolio is:

30% US Total Stock Market (like VTI Vanguard)

40% 20+ year Treasury bond (like TLT iShares)

15% 3-7 year Treasury bond (like IEI iShares)

7.5% Gold (like GLD SPDR)

7.5% Commodities (like GSG iShares)

I'm a 22y old pal and I've been saving for the last around 6 years now. Unfortunately only the last 1,5 years been into stocks. 

Currently my portfolio is around 80% dividend stocks and 20% growth stocks. I read all your comments above and I understand that when ""milking for passive income"", its easier to yield 3% from multiple cows than it is to get 10% from a single cow. What I mean is that it would be better to grow first and harvest later, which is the opposite of what I am doing now. I should focus more on growth than on dividends. 

Currently I got all what I can invest into stocks of these kinds. How would you turn my table around to growth stocks? Sell the dividend stocks and buy growth stocks?

913,AMD," Hi at 22 you should be 100% growth stocks 

I would not buy any etfs as they all charge 0.5% now that's not a lot on $375 but on $375,000 it is 

Your choice is 
1. Just buy the s&p 500 vanguard  $40,000 Then $500 a month for 30 years and you can retire at 52 years old with $1,700,000 you can take 5% of this to live on a year for life $85,000 pa

2. Buy (et fs)  and( re its) I would buy ishares clean energy  Cci  , DLR,  and  PLD 25% each $40,000 Then $500 a month  as above retire at 52 gives you $4,000,000   as above $200,000 pa 

3.  buy 100% stocks $40,000 Then $500 pcm for 20years till you are 42 years old I think you can get 16% easy on average with good quality stocks I get 25% to 35% most years so at 16% at 42 yrs old you will have $1,500,000 Then you find dividend stocks that are paying 4% as in 10 more years there dividends will have gone up to 5% or 6% just in time for you to start drawing money out   so the ,$1.5m will get more like 12% for the last ten years imo You will have $4,700,000  Then you take 5% a year income from 52 years old $235,000 a year 

The trick to this is to hold cash on the side so that in a big market dip or a reseshion you can buy more of your stocks at a discount Look to hold cash of 10% to 30% at all times when things are good in the market 10% and like today 30% 

Don't panic and sell when the stock is down just buy more  

Only buy your stocks with the $500 on red days and buy the stocks that are down the most on the day then next month do the same till your positions are full to the right % 

It could be a good plan to dca the $40,000 over the next 20 months so $2500 a month for 20 months then $500 from then on as I believe the market will drop 40% to 80%  sometime between next week and March 2022

Only buy your stocks with the $500 on red days and buy the stocks that are down the most on the day then next month do the same till your positions are full to the right % 

It could be a good plan to dca the $40,000 over the next 20 months so $2500 a month for 20 months then $500 from then on as I believe the market will drop 40% to 80%  sometime between next week and March 2022

938,WBA," Hi at 22 you should be 100% growth stocks 

I would not buy any etfs as they all charge 0.5% now that's not a lot on $375 but on $375,000 it is 

Your choice is 
1. Just buy the s&p 500 vanguard  $40,000 Then $500 a month for 30 years and you can retire at 52 years old with $1,700,000 you can take 5% of this to live on a year for life $85,000 pa

2. Buy (et fs)  and( re its) I would buy ishares clean energy  Cci  , DLR,  and  PLD 25% each $40,000 Then $500 a month  as above retire at 52 gives you $4,000,000   as above $200,000 pa 

3.  buy 100% stocks $40,000 Then $500 pcm for 20years till you are 42 years old I think you can get 16% easy on average with good quality stocks I get 25% to 35% most years so at 16% at 42 yrs old you will have $1,500,000 Then you find dividend stocks that are paying 4% as in 10 more years there dividends will have gone up to 5% or 6% just in time for you to start drawing money out   so the ,$1.5m will get more like 12% for the last ten years imo You will have $4,700,000  Then you take 5% a year income from 52 years old $235,000 a year 

The trick to this is to hold cash on the side so that in a big market dip or a reseshion you can buy more of your stocks at a discount Look to hold cash of 10% to 30% at all times when things are good in the market 10% and like today 30% 

Don't panic and sell when the stock is down just buy more  

Only buy your stocks with the $500 on red days and buy the stocks that are down the most on the day then next month do the same till your positions are full to the right % 

It could be a good plan to dca the $40,000 over the next 20 months so $2500 a month for 20 months then $500 from then on as I believe the market will drop 40% to 80%  sometime between next week and March 2022 

Stocks to buy in order of best stock first 

BRK,  PLD,  WBA,  PLNHF,  TTCF,  FB,  ELY, DLR,  TPGY,   SWCH,  Atvi,  HUYA,  CCL,  AMD,  FNV,  SHOP,  MELi ,  TDOC,  AMZN,  JD,  CRWD,  SPLK,  TMUS,  DBX,  ETSY,  QCOM,  BABA, PYPL,   BOMN 

I would buy them all and put 4% on the first 10 then 60% split evenly on the rest then keep an eye on them each week or month for the next 5 to 15 years

940,RKT," A lot of people are under the misconception that Rocket Companies is only a mortgage company. 

Rocket Companies is a Detroit-based holding company consisting of personal finance and consumer service brands including Rocket Mortgage, Rocket Homes (forsalebyowner), Rocket Loans, Rocket Auto, Rock Central, Amrock, Core Digital Media, Rock Connections, Lendesk and Edison Financial.

RKT is undervalued in my opinion. I expect it to reach at least $30 this year.",Sensitive_Reveal_227,5,/r/stocks/comments/leyacw/all_this_talk_of_rockets_lately/gmjeinn/,0.0,0.983,0.017,0.0258
941,EV," Definitely have a huge head start and laid the foundation in the US for mainstream EVs. It might not be the “only” luxury EV anymore but I think it’ll still be the best due to their brand. Once Apple enters it’ll be interesting to see what they do to innovate. But for you buying at 80 presplit, I don’t understand what would have changed over the last year other than feeling more and more confident in your investment, congrats on the gains!",CentristIdiot,6,/r/stocks/comments/lewbb8/another_tesla_post_but_i_think_its_calmer/gmihilr/,0.0,0.686,0.314,0.9861
942,GM," Tesla is going to face a whole lot of competition and I think it’s dominance is much overstated. It’s technology is incomparable but customers don’t buy cars based on which company has the best tech. If they did then those award winning cars in magazines would be the only ones to sell. Brand power always wins in consumer markets and Apple and GM have a lot. 

That being said you have about 3 years of easy gains left before any of that shit matters so enjoy the ride.",ReflectAA,2,/r/stocks/comments/lewbb8/another_tesla_post_but_i_think_its_calmer/gmj0s44/,0.043,0.653,0.304,0.9842

944,DD," I can't speak to your other questions, but to respond to your first bullet point, I think nowadays with fractional shares and investment opportunities being so readily available to the masses, any amount of money is ""enough"" to start investing.

For instance, though I didn't get sucked up into meme craze of the last few weeks, it did get me to start looking into learning as much about investing and finance as a whole as possible. 

I started with far less than $3k... I had been three weeks into a new diet and had an extra $200 sitting around saved from not eating out as much as I did before, so I put those savings in a couple of ETF's and equities that I felt would steadily grow over the course of time. Every week now, I calculate how much of my paycheck I can put into my investments to build a more diversified and stable portfolio. 

I figured, if I left that money in my checking account, it'd sit there until I spend it some day on bills or some bullshit. If I put it into a savings account, it might make me $.03 every four months in interest, but even if I could invest in .34 of a share of a well managed ETF every week, my weekly investments would grow by 5-10% every week and I'd have far more money at the end of the year than I'd put in. So far it's worked out pretty well. 

&#x200B;

With 3k to play around with, you have a lot more leeway in deciding how to put that capital to work for you. Coming to this sub for discussions and to learn how others here do their research and DD into particular equities will definitely benefit you in the long run as long as you learn to think about all that's being shared critically, with an open mind, but not one that will quickly jump on whatever hype train comes running around any given day/week without some serious consideration.",jackp0t789,3,/r/stocks/comments/lfbnuu/student_looking_to_invest/gml365t/,0.02,0.845,0.135,0.9904

950,IMO," I used to have Robinhood but I find that the platform is designed more to have “fun” and I would argue that it makes trading too easy.
