8,GPS," The big problem with Google street view or even Google maps on China is that they are highly inaccurate. This is because China uses a obfuscation scheme in their GPS coordinate systems. Due to national law, the use of geographic information in the People's Republic of China is restricted to entities that obtain a special authorization from the administrative department for surveying and mapping under the State Council. Consequences of the restriction include fines for unauthorized surveys, lack of geotagging information on many cameras when the GPS chip detects a location within China, incorrect alignment of street maps with satellite maps in various applications, and the criminalization of crowdsourced mapping efforts such as OpenStreetMap.

Basically if you're trying to locate a business address, especially from the US, you'll need to be somewhere familiar with the area you're looking at to be able to discern the actual location of an address entered directly into Google Maps.

Otherwise almost every address you enter is doing to be somewhere between 100m to 2km off target.

13,DD," >still running its office out of some fucking ghetto with some cops in the background of streetview clearing up some bodies? Or do they have plush offices in an affluent area which probably cost a small fortune to upkeep.

Berkshire Hathaway runs its offices out of a boring part of Omaha, across the street from Beertopia... it's a small, 5300 square foot office with fewer than 30 employees.

Berkshire Hathaway also has a market capitalization of $575 billion and a per share price of $368,000 and has consistently grown the tangible book value of its investments 20% per year since 1964, beating the S&P's 40 year CAGR.

>Firstly, I'm NOT saying ""oNly iNvEsT iN bIg CoRpOrAtE oFfICeS"" which is what some people think I'm saying.

Yes, I read the rest of your post... the simpler way to assess this is to triangulate value from three things:

1. Operating Cash flow
2. Tangible book value (Assets minus liabilities minus goodwill)
3. Net Current Assets (Working Capital)

That is *real* DD.  It helps you exclude the impact of PPE (Property, Plant and Equipment) without having to actually look to see if their offices are wasting money on gold toilets.

Also, and this is *really* important: Don't invest in companies headquartered in jurisdictions that are very lax on accounting fraud or whose accounting rules you don't/can't understand.",th3cr1t1c,2,/r/stocks/comments/lq7kxd/google_street_view_should_be_one_of_your_first/goh2xwu/,0.065,0.858,0.077,0.1779

68,DD," Everything is possible, but let me tell you one thing.

For entire past years till now i have been watching about 3 generations of people in r/pennystocks

And all of them blow up their accounts, you are lucky enough if you escape with net 0. I watch a generation get sucked in with huge runners, everyone earns money, wibe of happiness and great shit, then they get slowly sucked out for everything they have, until its been half a year and nobody remembers last time they even earned something on pennsystocks, everyone realizes that yeeting your money on Tesla and Apple and stuff would been a lot better and leave.

Comes new generation, rinse and repeat.

Yes its possible to earn money off pennystocks and i even know a person doing that, but you gotta realize if you are not top 1% of the top 1% you are going to be a 99% of the suckers that can't even stay positive.

Definitely not worth the time investment. Its definitely worth it if you have boner for stock market, because plenty of times you have to know the basic rules of stock market with pennystocks, and its a lot of fun, rules that nobody notices with large caps because you can buy and sell them any time you please.

When you do go in you will realize last time you heard someone say something trutful was this exact comment, its a vicious world out there. People usually get shunned and downvoted to hell for going against any narrative.

Biggest advantage i had is that i knew exactly what pennystocks were being pumped, what was happening because it already happened before and i even remember the names of the companies. If the DD of the company checks out you might still end up holding bag because you just don't know the history as to say.

Now to go to your plan, problem is that you are not going to catch the pump, after you catch the stock, its already up and its too late, if you FOMO in then say goodbye to your portfolio. That is the most known problem that every company that gets any visibility is up 200 - 3000% already, like there are companies that went almost a year without any news, coverage or existence suddenly pumped. And every time you will read about it its already too late to consistently make money off it.

Even if you make it before the pump, i don't think its the best feeling sitting with pennystock in your portfolio that might not do anything for the next 20 years, or even go bankrupt on top of that.

If you magically know everything that is going to get pumped, do tell me, it will make us billionaires.

Though your approach of being less greedy than others in theory is a very good one, though it can't promise tendies.",DarkRooster33,2,/r/stocks/comments/lq7kxd/google_street_view_should_be_one_of_your_first/gogr0su/,0.107,0.786,0.107,0.4475

76,OR," Wait! I dont understand this argument. 
You're saying a bunch of big movers exited bond positions causing bond prices to drop (and yield to go up) and they did one of two things:

1. Move that money into the stock market, OR
2. Sit on the cash

However, they couldnt have moved it into the stock market since that would imply stock prices go up. So, they are sitting on the cash. (but why?)

Now, on the other side, people in the stock market see higher yields, get spooked and exit positions and what do they do then?

1. Move into the bond market, OR
2. Sit on cash

As per your thesis, the only logical conclusion is - everyone is sitting on cash.

I find that hard to believe. However, I am also not an expert. Can someone please explain why OP's thesis makes sense and how I have got this wrong?

143,SQ," Everyone has their own risk tolerances and can decide when is best for them to get out of the market. If a new investor decides to YOLO his money based off a random post on reddit, that is their decision and not at all the responsibility of OP.

No one knows the future and what will happen. Everyone was expecting a recession/crash when the pandemic started and sold everything off (like me selling all my shares of SQ at 80) only for the market to reach record highs shortly after (SQ is now at 250). If you try to time the market, you will lose - the best strategy is to buy into companies you believe in (if you get it on a dip, then kudos to you) and then hold as they continue to grow.

167,USA," Because nothing in terms of their adaptation or pricing trajectory has changed in the last 5 years.  Renewables have always BEEN growing, and the world has known they will pivot to them.  

The reason they are driving up in value is simply because interest rates have bottomed out.  So these companies earnings from years 2025-2035 look that much more robust than before, and award a higher valuation.

Renewables (and all large growth companies with small revenues today) are an interest rate play, not just a technology play.  The tech risk has remained largely stable over the last few years, and outside of Biden winning...what has changed?  

I’d even argue the Covid debt hangover will make renewable adoption much more difficult in the 2020’s because so much more money will be directed to repayment or reducing expenses rather than projects such as these.  

The USA reliance on fossil fuels will decline, then likely plateau in the next decade.  That will be significant.  More significant though is the 20% MORE people on the planet in 10 years then now.  And they will not be in places that can afford to spend 2x on electricity or transportation.  Thus, fossil fuels in general will plateau in usage for generations to come, until a larger technological breakthrough.",CarRamRob,1,/r/stocks/comments/lqhbv5/lets_not_panic_here_this_selloff_is_a_healthy/goie8v3/,0.042,0.83,0.128,0.9493

196,EVER, Ok I agree with all the comments which I am guessing is coming from the way MOST have been trained to think from no fault of their own. THATS THE WAY IT WAS NOT THE  WAY ITS GUNNA BE.  I believe things will shift greatly in the near future. The retail world is starting to learn how to make that change. “5 million to move a ticker to make profit”. If you take 2000 retail nubs to put up 2500 what’s that give you. Do what you think is right and take care of yourself. Self preservation is why we invest ya?? 2 things will never ever change ppl will make $ and ppl will lose$. I have worked to hard to give my money away. Fomo is not a valid reason to invest. But it is a chance to learn and manage you risk without fucking up what you built. I have lost a lot who gives a fuck it’s lessons you paid for some more then others. I could ramble for ever but 1 thing you should take from this nonsense is. Don’t EVER FUCKN GIVE UP. that’s when you will lose everything. It’s only money. I am retarded and eat a lot of crayons.

201,AMC," Since AMC tanked your gains have you been taking more risks trading to try and get your value back up?

If so it sounds to me like a gambler's panic. I've seen it before in sports betting as well as trading. Someone backs a team or a stock that is surefire, they couldn't possibly lose, so they put more money on the line than they're comfortable losing. What's more, the ego gets a bit involved and attached to the bet. 

Then it tanks. Suddenly you've lost the money you were certain was going to rocket and the ego takes a hammering.

So then the riskier bets start rolling in to try and claw back some of the losses and some of the bruised pride.

It can work out, but usually the panic bets aren't really well thought out and will let you down. 

My advice would be to slow down and stop chasing trends. I can't advise whether to sell AMC, I'm not involved in it at all and I don't know what other stocks/positions you're in. However, I do think taking a step back, calming down and stopping the risky moves for some time is needed because I don't think you can stomach many more setbacks.",Somaliona,4,/r/stocks/comments/lpz4xo/the_whole_gmeamc_trend_completely_derailed_my/goe4ksh/,0.103,0.799,0.098,-0.2958

\#1 When in doubt, trade less.  There will always be new opportunity, you just need to wait for it sometimes.  Don't just buy whatever looks best at the time.  Many times it's just best not to trade.

\#2 Patience, patience, patience.  I think you learned this one pretty well with your AMC trade.  If you missed an opportunity, just be patient.  If you still like the stock, just watch it.  Good chance it'll be cheap again at some point in the future.

209,AMC," You have to figure out how you want to handle your investments going forward. My suggestion is only use 15-20% of your available stock balance on 'fun' stocks and the remaining on a long-term portfolio. What I mean by fun is basically money that you can afford to lose for risky plays such as AMC and GME. Don't YOLO risky stocks unless you can afford to lose that money.

What's happening right now is you're catching two falling knives - one with AMC/GME and now with with the small dips that have been happening the past week. You're buying at the wrong time and price. 

To me, it seems you're emotionally investing rather than having a solid plan on how you invest and why you choose to do it. FOMO isn't a valid reason to buy stocks. Those gains can quickly turn to losses in the market we are in today. Buy companies you expect to hold and can look back in the future and not have to constantly worry about the market.

217,MMM," Im newish but It sounds like you overreached with a portfolio that isn’t fully of the ground. Mine isn’t either but growing so I know how single tickers can effect you especially early on. It sounds like you took the cash from your previous hard work and sunk it into a single stock I think you are better of setting aside a certain % (say 20-25)for that and not the whole gain. And either pocket the rest or reinvest in “safe bets” like a dividend aristocrat or VOO


Stop digging and patience is really the solution and maybe develop a more specific strategy/watchlist (or at least go back to what was working) that you don’t deviate from. Im a small baller and no expert I started investing late August. I was in the red for almost the first three months I pivoted a portion of my portfolio from entirely “COVID flips” my initial investing idea to value dividend stocks. These helped stabilize me and dividends helped me ride the red psychologically. I also started using limit buys to be a bit picker about my entry but I’m buy and hold mostly so I have time on my side. I bought a company with a higher share price (for me) this overweighted my portfolio but that company was MMM and was a good and relatively safe stock a combination of these moves and the announcement of the Pfizer vaccine pulled me out of the red.

If you hold, chances are in the next year or two they’ll grow (maybe not as high as what you put in) but maybe a lot closer than what it is now. These stocks have warning labels attached to them right now so people that have no idea what happened probably pass up the opportunity to buy just because of that. Give this history lesson a chance to die down and as the financial picture is painted with the next few quarterly reports maybe then people will believe in these stocks again as well. Right now a lot are just hurting and trying to get out from the losses. Think about this the only time you lose with a stock is when you sell at a loss. Looking at the red in your portfolio and trying to get rid of it too early won’t help.

332,AMC," > Why not? 2 years ago they were around that price.

Because if 2020 has shown anything, is that the movie industry does not need theaters in order to survive and prosper.

The proliferation of direct-to-streaming movies over the last 2 years has been exponential.

People will want to go to the movies, but that doesn't necessarily mean progits.

AMC and Regal (the two largest chains in the US) only keep ~51% of ticket sales, and the rest are sent to the studio. In addition, their contracts (especially with disney) usually stipulate which theaters their movies must be showed in, and what projection systems have to be installed.

This means that AMC makes an effective loss on each ticket sale. The only way they stay solvent is through concessions.

However, for the price of a Large popcorn and a ticket, you can buy a month of a studio's streaming platform; and for the price of a large soda, you can then buy that movie title the day it comes out.

AMC did wonders with their Moviepass-style subscription service, but that mostly is a dying business model with the aforementioned streaming for the same price.


In addition, the 4x dilution of the stock serves to deflate prices.

339,VERY," I've been in and out trading for a little over 2 years. 

The last year being with any sort of consistency. 

I made amazing gains during the beginning of covid. And I'm happy I did. Starting with 200 dollars I made enough to pull put my rent each month and start over until June when I moved out. 

Started the year by trying again. 500 is now 1,600. 

It's not much. But since I learned a little bit and had some confidence from trading during a VERY bullish time. I started the year with that 500 and made some rules. I want 10% growth a week. The second I hit that I close positions and make plans for the next week.

Last week I hit that 10% in the last few hours of trading on Friday. Last week was hard.

This morning I closed 2 positions that I bought on Friday that made my account up 12% when I woke up. Closed them immediately. Now I'm done for the week. 

I've lost out on money I could have made, sure.

But I almost always hit my weekly goal and sometimes accidentally go over it.

Following only a few strict rules has led to what I wanted:

How many massive movies have came out in 2020 versus how many have been delayed until theatres come back?

Pretty much every major blockbuster / highly-anticipated film has been put on the backburner.

007. A whole slate of Marvel features. Matrix 4. The Batman. Dune. Avatar 2. Suicide Squad. The Northman. Plus everything that was due to be released/was released around the start of Covid which will be re-released, like A Quiet Place 2 etc. Film production started up around June in some cases worldwide, so we've got a massive backlog of releases. Production companies are still afraid of releasing straight to online.

415,EV," Pelosi is arguably the strongest Democrat in politics outside of Biden. You could make a very valid case that she probably is stronger than Biden. Since Democrats control both Houses, it is much easier for them to get what they want and Pelosi's strong ties with Democrats and Democrats already pushing for EV and green alternatives makes it almost a guarantee.

No they didn't. They blocked a large amount of volatile tickers, many of which never saw reddit. How many tickers do you think get mentioned on r/stocks or r/wallstreetbets or r/pennystocks or r/spacs in a day? Surely more than the 20 or 30 they blocked. How volatile was BB that day? Where lending requirements raised on BB too? AMC? To summarize, the laws are written to favor these guys, and I saw no evidence that anything was done illegally.

When I go to the store and want to buy $10 of something, they don't say ""oh you can buy $10 of bananas, but you can't buy $10 of apples""

Yes the squeeze always made sense (it fucking happened already) but if you have no idea what you are doing and no plan, why did you think you could get in an out in a squeeze?

There was nothing illegal about what happened, despite how much you want that justification for the profits you missed out on. Someone first told me about Robinhood in 2014 and I distinctly remembered looking into it and quickly noping the fuck out because something like this was always a possibility (along with everyday shitty execution).

OP, the market gave you and millions of others a big lesson, and its always better to make big mistakes early.

You threw a significant amount of money for you at a bad stock because it was a meme and when it 4x in under 2 weeks you didn’t capture your losses. Such is the risk with doing this type of trading. It’s not a matter of if it would free fall, you were just playing with fire hoping you timed it right and but you didn’t.",dpigott24,6,/r/stocks/comments/lq7lo0/cant_move_on_from_january_28th/gof7tac/,0.128,0.731,0.141,0.3187
482,RH," > I was illegally cheated out of twenty thousand dollars, retail was illegally cheated out of at least millions, perhaps billions. And no one will face consequences. Explain to me, specifically, how it's stupidly dramatic to be upset about that


Firstly, you don't know that the stock would have continued to go up. Could it have gone up more? Sure, and i'm not saying that the brokers did not screw you guys over at this point. Even I jumped on the gamestop train for a few days just to be a part of it. Losing sleep on meme stock and hypotheticals will never make sense to me. 

  
> there is a life outside of the stock market.

this was only in reference to that you shouldn't lose sleep on meme stocks.

> lmao. the old ""yes, we investigated ourselves and we found we did nothing wrong."" that's what I expect.

Game is and always will be rigged. There is a hearing going on and let's see what it results to, at the very least we can hopefully expect some sort of new regulations coming out for these brokers, but again this is pure speculation.

> Here it is everyone! the punchline. great build up to get here. ""Poor RH, their precious business is going to go bankrupt."" ""Try to think about RH in these trying times."" F right off. 

I don't understand why you think I'm trying to paint robinhood as a victim here. If robinhood should be scrutinized or not, it's not up to me...that's what the investigation is for. Regardless of if the company has shitty practices or not, they will obviously prioritize their wellbeing first.

493,NMS," >If the stock market is pegged to fundamentals based valuations

The stock market isn’t pegged to anything, and I think there’s widespread consensus that much of the stock market is detached from fundamentals.

>then why is there even a bid-ask? If there is a buyer at $450 and a seller at $450, we make a deal.

Putting aside the implicit assumption of perfect information, the bid-ask spread exists because there are multiple buyers and sellers of each stock with intersecting utility curves. E.g., I’m completely unwilling to sell my stock for less than $100 a share and infinitely willing to sell it for infinity dollars per share. There’s a mirror curve on the sell side. You can think of each bid and ask as an inflection point on one of these curves.

Each share can only transact between one buyer and one seller. Buyers and sellers need to find each other via brokers, and the brokers have varying motivations (regulation NMS, price improvement, payment for order flow) that alter the exact clearing price for each transaction. This feeds into the quote, which then feeds back into the bid and ask prices on subsequent ticks (market orders, active trading strategies).

>I’m trying to understand what systemic risk was posed by the price going up and the only one I see is a result of brokerages/clearing houses holding positions that could possibly bankrupt them under unlikely circumstances then those circumstances coming to fruition.

The systemic risk was that some brokers would be unable to meet their requirements and become unable to trade, causing a chain reaction of panic (“financial contagion”). It’s unclear to me precisely what these requirements were, but I believe it was the new collateral requirements DTC instituted, which I am assuming were to protect against massive failures to deliver that would have happened had the squeeze played out naturally.

Peterffy argued on CNBC that had the squeeze been left to play out its natural course, the result would not have been retail getting rich, but a mess of failed transactions that would never have gotten sorted out.",player2,2,/r/stocks/comments/lq7lo0/cant_move_on_from_january_28th/gofmrdy/,0.069,0.854,0.077,0.4774

Let's say Joe's car wash goes public. They just closed half of their car washes, their customers are leaving bad reviews and going to other places. But...

496,RH," >Who was on the hook to buy out the shorts if the price theoretically hit $2000

If the share price hits $2,000, lenders will probably call in their borrowed shares so they can sell them in the open market. The shorts who borrowed the shares are on the hook to return the shares, which usually means they have to buy in the open market to cover. If the shorts can’t cover, the broker who lent out the shares is required to cover, since their duty is to their client who wants their shares back.

I honestly still don’t completely understand the relationship between overextended short interest and the increased collateral requirements, from DTC or from the clearing middleman RH contracted with when their internal clearing platform failed. I can understand the scenario the collateral requirements and buying restrictions were intended to halt, but I still don’t 100% understand how we got from 140% short interest to that point.",player2,3,/r/stocks/comments/lq7lo0/cant_move_on_from_january_28th/gofljm5/,0.013,0.871,0.116,0.9001

The stock will get ahead of itself, come back down to reality or where most people still think its overvalued on paper, but probably a steal in the long run. People who have always kicked themselves for not buying TSLA usually miss these buying opportunities because the stock still looks overvalued due to the fundamentals even when it crashes, and there is probably a bit of confirmation bias when those people see a stock they have always been jealous of go down by a lot. In reality idk where TSLA stock is going in the next few months, year, or two years even, but the bubble pop where TSLA looses 90%+ of its value overnight will def never happen.

540,DD," Aunt Cathie just purchased a lot of TSLA today. so it could possibly be just a dip along with whole market. 

I personally don't really think TSLA is going to tank like many are speculating. It may fall a bit more, but it will eventually bounce back. IMO they are still way ahead of others in EV/AV. Sure they are lagging on manufacturing capacity, but with new factories coming in Austin, Germany and India, they will catch up. 

And most importantly they are sitting on driving data of millions of miles which will make sure they have a massive advantage over other EV/AV players. Data is king but doesn't get counted in the usual financial analysis. This is what Cathie too bets on and I agree with her.

Adding Biden's clean energy agenda and Elon's x factor it is probably going to be solid in the next few years.

I will continue to remain bullish on TSLA, but that of course doesn't mean we are going to see it go up 10x like what we have seen earlier. It will probably be more on the lines of something like MSFT.   I bought the dip today at around 730, but I will probably wait for a few more days to see how it plays out before buying again.

This is the problem we have in the US as well. I just bought a new gasoline car instead of a Tesla because the infrastructure isn't there. I live in a county of a few million people and there are less than 10 EV charging stations and none are close to me. Maybe 10 years from now when I'm looking for a new car again the situation will be different, but for now EV would be nothing but a hassle. 

I also think Tesla shot its shot and failed. The giant American and Japanese car companies are jumping in the EV market and there is no way Tesla will be able to compete with them in terms of price or numbers.

575,FSD," Good question. Musk has said before that he plans to sell around 20M vehicles by sometime around 2030. If you want to go with a more modest estimate of 10M, that's fine and we can work with that number for rn. Tesla's car business + FSD revenue alone is worth a lot of money. This is excluding it's growing solar roof, power/megapack, and other software related sales(acceleration upgrades + os features in their cars). Elon Musk has stated before how Tesla's FSD software will eventually be worth about 100k per car. He could sell that as a full package to large shipping companies that are buying the Tesla semi because 100k is ultimately a lot cheaper than paying for a person to drive your truck over the same period you'd own a self-driving truck. Furthermore, he has stated before that a fleet of robotaxis either owned by tesla, or through the costumers themselves will bring in about 30k a year for each vehicle. 30k \* 10M is 300B a year in pure revenue since software sales are high margin. This number could grow to 600B a year if Tesla produces 20M which I don't think is relatively unlikely. Along with that, the majority of Tesla cars sold in ten years will be 25-35k dollars each, and with gross margins of 30% Tesla could make an additional 90-180B(9k gross margin from 30k vehciles\* 10-20M). Add these together and Tesla could be making 390-780B a year just from its auto and FSD business. Again, that is leaving out their other ventures that I mentioned before. Apple makes about 260B a year in revenue and is currently sitting at a market cap of 2T. Basically, I think Tesla's biggest revenue streams in 10years will be selling cars, selling full autonomy for those cars, and then their energy sector which is pretty underdeveloped atm. To go along with that, Tesla has very deep moats in these sectors. The biggest moat is the fact that every engineer wants to work at one of Musk's companies which means he gets the best engineers that can innovate the most. To me that is actually the most important fact if you try to analyze Tesla. Just my thoughts.",redmars1234,5,/r/stocks/comments/lpyukn/has_the_tesla_bubble_popped/goe1xni/,0.022,0.901,0.077,0.9402

They still have around 20% market Share last year (EV wise).

20% Market Share for selling basically Model 3.

If they get a cheaper car to fight with ID3, Leaf and Zoe, they will easily keep that market Share but obviously they could increase it.

The next 3/4 years are decisive for Tesla. Just launching a 25k car and a ride-sharing app (even with human drivers) can make it go over 1T.

594,SP," While you are right to caution people to not blindly follow a high risk, professionally managed portfolio blindly, this still isn’t exactly accurate. 

I’ve seen this posted a decent amount as well, and you must be conflating actively managed ETFs and index benchmarked etfs that are passively managed and must rebalance their purchases. A SP 500 ETF has to buy and sell Tesla to maintain a weight exactly as you described. 

An actually managed ETF is not subject to this constraint, except some concentration regulations and ARK’s prospectus (which I have heard caps any one security to 10% of the portfolio, I haven’t read it). ARK can buy and sell, any day, as they please. Every time they are buying Tesla, they are at the very least re affirming their stance that it should be the #1 holding in their portfolio. They sell it occasionally because of the concentration threshold they gave to maintain per their prospectus.

TLDR; while you are 100% right retail investors should not blindly follow ARK, their buys and sells are completely discretionary and time driven. While at any one given time they may want Tesla to arbitrarily be 10%, they are not required to do so in any way. Each buy and sell is strategic to some degree and their target % is subject to change at any time.",throwaway122112563,49,/r/stocks/comments/lqm730/here_is_what_ark_does_everyday_know_how_portfolio/goh8gjp/,0.017,0.937,0.046,0.6808

Just a small example and I mean, I know it is easy to post a ""good"" trade after the price has settled, but my point is still valid. I have a bunch of those let's say 'riskier' stocks such as CRSR, CRSPR, NET, PLTR among others. They were \*\*\*\*ing bleeding, down 18%, 12%, 14% etc. You get the gist. Sweaty morning for sure. Anyways, I also have other stuff such as LYV.

What did I do today? I have been looking for a while to take profit/exit my position of LYV. I bought at \~$40 back in May 7th, so a solid \~100%. I know stuff is opening up, but I think that is already included in the current price estimates, they have an earnings in two days etc. Just felt like a good time to exit. LYV and other of those stocks hit hard by the corona lockdown was relatively stable, so down like 1-2% during the opening today. This is by no means a promotion of PLTR, I am just bullish on it and wanted to rebalance my portfolio to include more PLTR. It was down what, over 13% at some point which was exaggerated imho and it was clearly an opportunity to buy. If you looked, it seems like there is some sort of floor at $24 dollars. Even if you do not have the liquidity, you can always take a look at your portfolio and rebalance it, and days like these are super good to do so. If you think there is an overcorrection or if you are looking for an exit in a position, be a bit cold and actually do the trade, if you believe there is an opportunity to buy something else.

Sold 21 LYV @ 87.91

Bought 70 PLTR @ 24.00 => e.g. with 70 more, I have a total of 504 PLTR

889,DD," I am from China and would like to share you folks some empirical DD from my first hand understanding of the Chinese market. I will talk about Tesla and other Chinese EV here.

The big picture is China has made very big commitment in reducing carbon emission from cars. At least for private automobiles, this is much more than political propaganda. China has been heavily subsidizing EV industry for years but nothing profitable really pops out before 2016. This is the original idea of introducing Tesla factory to Shanghai, to stir the water. After that the governmental subsidy on EV become much more selective and more than a few dozens of ppt-EV firms are eliminated. At the meantime, Shanghai takes a huge bet with Tesla: Tesla get the factory land for free if they could reach a annual tax contribution. Measured with sales it is roughly 500k model-3 per year. This may also explain why Tesla cut the price so hard. This is also why I am positive with Tesla in at least a 10-year term. By then the land it self would worth several billion: real estate in Shanghai is the biggest gain for many local. Btw, Bilibili has recently invested one billion into Shanghai real estate as well.

So what this means for Neo and Xpeng? China wants Tesla bad, but bad as a fierce catfish, but not a shark that swallowed local EV.
China would definitely want Tesla in the game, but would not tolerate Tesla taking away the biggest EV share. China sees EV industry as a big chance to catch up with the West given the shorter tech gap compared to gas cars. Eventually, Chinese EVs will at least take more than 50% of sales in China. Think for a moment how big it is. 

As for the current feedback on EV brands in China. Tesla has been through a few PR fiascos in China, while Neo is winning big on service. And I doubt how many American investor know that when Neo was at the edge of bankruptcy last year, a municipal investment Corp from Hefei save its ass with a multi-billion risk investment.  Hefei is probably the best municipal investor for the last two decades in China. Now many Chinese are seriously considering between BMW, Mercedes, and Neo at 50-80k car purchase. I really don’t know much about Xpeng as I have no friends buying it.. And the name Xpeng sounds really no-taste in Chinese, basically a West Virginia EV called Chad.

900,CEO," I’m reposting a previous comment because I think you’re missing quite a lot. For example, you’re misled if you think examining their revenues like any other company is a way to evaluate this.

So, I actually got interest in Roblox from my niece who plays it non-stop and you can be sure a few of my own dollars have gone to this company by way of her puppy eyes. First off, I’m definitely not a veteran investor by any means but when I do I know where I’m putting my money. Im pretty bullish on Roblox long term as compared to some of my other investments.

Here are some things worth talking about in terms of their upcoming DPO:

• Money talks.

It’s very, very important that if you’re looking at how much money Roblox brings in you’re looking at their bookings and not their revenue. Due to how they are forced to recognize the money that comes in, some of their revenue is reported in a delayed fashion as opposed to instantly recognizing purchases of in-game currency.

On this point we haven’t even gotten a peek into what is surely a huge spike in revenue due to the Christmas season, we only got to see the first nine months! If their first nine months brought $1.2B, I predict an overall bookings of at least $2B overall money brought in for the 2021 year. When you’re looking at companies in their peer group like perhaps Unity and even out of their “class” like Snowflake, this is more money than either of those two companies brought in.

You mentioned Rockstar games...who reported $540M in revenue for 2020. Not even the same class anymore. In 2018? Sure. But Roblox has them in their rear view as far as business, obviously tech and polish has to catch up which they can soon.

Lastly, their free cash flows ($292M!!!) are also a good indicator of how healthy this business is and it’s a good assurance against their “losses” they posted in the S1. This isn’t mentioning the >$700M in cash assets. They’re dumping money into hiring engineers (the company is something like 80% engineers, very lean and strong) and investing in the platform. They’re technically operating at a loss but it’s only because of the way they’re recognizing revenue but this business is way past cash flow positive.

• Foreign expansion.

One huge point is that they haven’t even really capitalized yet in their foreign customers. Their customers in Europe if I’m remembering from the S1 are only monetized about ~25% compared to their US customers. This is a huge opportunity given the fact their foreign presence in developed countries is increasing as well. So if they’re at nearly (my estimate given what will be a massive fourth quarter) $2B bookings just off of North American monetization, I imagine >$4B isn’t too far off if they can continue to grow their userbase overseas (especially Europe and China) and continue to ramp up their monetization.

One thing I don’t see talked about enough is their China partnership that recently achieved a grant from the government to operate in that country. We know China as the heart of mobile gaming and especially customers that ache to spend money virtually, and we’ve seen that with other games (I play DoTa and I know Chinese players have money to burn on virtual goods). This is absolutely HUGE news, and should be bigger news than their DPO. A the biggest market in the world with an ever growing middle class with a propensity for online spending and playing? This is a match made in heaven.

• Their investment in engineering.

I mentioned this earlier but their company is really lean and spends money efficiently in a place where I think a tech company should: on their product. To be honest, I think the game looks like shit but the gameplay of a lot of the games on the platform is actually really polished.

If they continue to focus on their creation tools, and give their developers more freedom to create cool shit I can’t see their momentum going anywhere especially as they try to age. Some of their new avatars (my niece hates them) really fit the teenage demographic, and this aging up initiative will work as they’ve been investing in more mature game developers as well.

Lastly, this is also huge is they own their own serversThey aren’t sinking money into AWS, which could be a money sink for a lot of companies.

That’s all I’ve got off the top of my head, their S1 provided most of this information. When their valuation came out I of course was dampened but only because I figured the secret was being let out and I could no longer hope to get in on the basement price. But it shows that smart investors with deep pockets see the same things I see, and I’m surprised the valuation didn’t come to something like $40-50B with the points I listed above.

I think this is going to be one of those Facebook type stocks, where you give it a couple years and you’ll have house paid off before you know it off of a solid initial investment.

The only problem I think they have is a hard to explain business plan with tough revenue reporting that keeps them on the down low. The numbers don’t pop if you don’t understand them, and people still think they’re “a game”. If you think kids are going to go to “Minecraft and Fortnite” once they’re done with Roblox, you don’t even realize someone on Roblox has most likely made similar games on the platform and is also making money off the concept.
They’re the YouTube of games, and they print money. As you can tell, I’m fairly high on them.

Disclaimer, I am not a financial advisor and I am a regular Joe so excuse me if I missed finer points. Would love to discuss.

EDIT: I missed one point. Have they even touched advertising yet? When Adidas eventually has their own hosted game on the platform advertising in game shoes as well as their own shoes...my goodness, the coffers will overflow. The CEO talks a lot about a meta verse where you do regular shit with your friends, I imagine this is how that idea gets monetized.",ZhukovsSwingingDick,5,/r/stocks/comments/lq3z3l/back_for_more_with_a_mini_dd_on_roblox/gofyej2/,0.047,0.805,0.149,0.9989

I have been investing for 10 years and still bought that stupid stock and ended up losing bunch of money. In my case though, it was money I was ok to lose and under 0.5% of my portfolio.

The best advice I can give is that start with investing in companies with solid fundamentals like MSFT, APPL, AMZN. They may not go up as much but also much safer investments. This will give you some confidence. While you do that, read about current trends and find investments/companies which you believe in. Invest a little, learn, rinse and repeat.

>My main argument: EV companies are currently amazon in their bookshop phase

I  don't think that they are amazon. Amazon changed the way people shop.  Other than longer refueling the EV does not change the car in any  meaningful way. In some ways like refueling it is even a step backwards  until the technology catches up. The auto industry has historically been  low margin and highly competitive. Add infrastructure that will not be  possible to built (like a lot of parts in Africa or Asia) or  infrastructure that has to be overhauled (like the UK) to be ready for  charging stations and it increases costs even more so.

Also  what will autonomous driving add as a ROI? Won't it decrease car sales  as buses will be autonomous and become a much cheaper mode of transport?

>I   would argue that the valuations of both TSLA, NIO and other large EV   companies is seriously undervalued - I'm not basing this on the number   of cars they manufacture nor the effectiveness of their electric battery   potential but on the billions they're investing in the development of   full self driving automation.

Why  would that make them undervalued? It would actually make them more  overvalued since they are not getting returns on the capital invested.

>In   the next 10 years, we are likely to see full automation especially  with  the advent of quantum computing leading to a huge increase in   computational power ([https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/09/ibm-promises-1000-qubit-quantum-computer-milestone-2023](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/09/ibm-promises-1000-qubit-quantum-computer-milestone-2023))   - The companies that are heavily investing in developing this   technology aren't the classic car manufactures such as GM, Chevrolet or   Chrysler but instead the large EV companies that have grown   exponentially in the past year. Like many people I'm viewing companies   like NIO or TSLA as tech companies and not car manufacturers. They're   main value is in the code they develop for automation.

I  don't think we will see autonomous driving nor mass quantum computing  in the next 20 years. The old manufacturers realize that developing  driving assists makes more common sense and creates an actual ROI.

>Once   full autonomous driving becomes realistic, these companies can lease   their code as a service and basically replace the need for any job which   requires drivers i.e. delivery drivers, truck drivers, taxi drivers.

It will not happen in the next 20 years. I could go on for hours why, but here are 6 quick reasons.

1. **Changing conditions:**  The roads constantly change. That might be due to changing weather,  construction or accidents. Driving on icy roads is tricky in itself,  making it drive autonomously will be even harder. Add different road  signs in different countries, right hand and left hand driving and you  have tasks that become incredibly complex.
2. **Smooth Driving:**  This is something that is hardly ever talked about. I have tried the  self driving in several cars including Tesla and it is like driving with  a teenager who just had his third driving lesson. It cannot merge  smoothly into lanes or accelerate without it having to have the correct  distance to the car in front, something that is not always feasible  especially when lanes combine. Also how the car approaches stops is just  not smooth it will take a while.
3. **Liabilities/Insurance**: Stuff does always happen. Who will be responsible for a crash? The driver is autonomous so who will it be?
4. **Cybercrime:**  What happens when cars get hacked? It is a computer so it is not only a  possibility but will inevitably happen. Who will be responsible if  there are deaths?
5. **Ethics:**  This is another hardly talked about aspect. When having people they  make split-second decisions. If you have to choose which life to spare,  how will the computer choose? Will there be different ethics from  different manufacturers and especially in different countries?
6. **Regulatory:** Governments are slow to adapt to new technology. Here it won't be different.

>The   main example I've been using for this is Domino's Pizza in the UK -   They have about 1126 stores in the UK, let's say they conservatively   they hire 5 delivery drivers per store and those drivers on average work   about 5 days a week and a total of 6 hours per day (the three hours   around lunch and three around dinner) - Let's also assume they only get   paid minimum wage - This comes out to a total expenditure of about   £80mill per year ($110 mill) for dominoes just based on paying their   drivers wages, not countering in fuel or other expenditures that they do   also cover - And that's only one company in the UK.  
If   automation occurs, which again these companies are investing heavily  in  and the underlying infrastructure and technology is beginning to  reach  basic requirements, these EV companies can create a code as  service  model along with the profit from actually selling the car and  basically  make drivers redundant

You still need someone who takes the pizza to the door.

>My  argument  is that basically at the moment these EV companies are amazon  in their  bookshop phase, people are betting that they'll sell lots of  books (cars  in this case because they're clean energy) and I think  they're going to  end up becoming juggernauts that basically take over  our daily lives to  the same extent amazon now does

Like many people I'm viewing companies   like NIO or TSLA as tech companies and not car manufacturers. They're   main value is in the code they develop for automation.

>Once   full autonomous driving becomes realistic, these companies can lease   their code as a service and basically replace the need for any job which   requires drivers i.e. delivery drivers, truck drivers, taxi drivers.

It will not happen in the next 20 years. I could go on for hours why, but here are 6 quick reasons.

1. **Changing conditions:**  The roads constantly change. That might be due to changing weather,  construction or accidents. Driving on icy roads is tricky in itself,  making it drive autonomously will be even harder. Add different road  signs in different countries, right hand and left hand driving and you  have tasks that become incredibly complex.
2. **Smooth Driving:**  This is something that is hardly ever talked about. I have tried the  self driving in several cars including Tesla and it is like driving with  a teenager who just had his third driving lesson. It cannot merge  smoothly into lanes or accelerate without it having to have the correct  distance to the car in front, something that is not always feasible  especially when lanes combine. Also how the car approaches stops is just  not smooth it will take a while.
3. **Liabilities/Insurance**: Stuff does always happen. Who will be responsible for a crash? The driver is autonomous so who will it be?
4. **Cybercrime:**  What happens when cars get hacked? It is a computer so it is not only a  possibility but will inevitably happen. Who will be responsible if  there are deaths?
5. **Ethics:**  This is another hardly talked about aspect. When having people they  make split-second decisions. If you have to choose which life to spare,  how will the computer choose? Will there be different ethics from  different manufacturers and especially in different countries?
6. **Regulatory:** Governments are slow to adapt to new technology. Here it won't be different.

I  don't think that they are amazon. Amazon changed the way people shop.  Other than longer refueling the EV does not change the car in any  meaningful way. In some ways like refueling it is even a step backwards  until the technology catches up. The auto industry has historically been  low margin and highly competitive. Add infrastructure that will not be  possible to built (like a lot of parts in Africa or Asia) or  infrastructure that has to be overhauled (like the UK) to be ready for  charging stations and it increases costs even more so.

The green initiatives countries are attempting simply won't be possible without, a near 100% switch to public EV ownership and large short term energy storage solutions to compensate for load instability from renewable sources. You could either invest billions in new nuclear facilities and then additional billions in long term waste storage or you could invest billions in renewable sources and large scale short term energy storage that won't make the drinking water dangerous for 25 thousand years. 

I don't have the time to really dive into the costs but rough estimates put the cost of a power wall plus solar installation at less than 16-20k. In Maine with the lowest solar production ratio you could theoretically be completely independent of the electrical grid in a 10000 kwh power usage per year home and have return on your investment in roughly 14-15 years and these prices are only going to come down especially as governments get increasingly zealous in investing in the swap.

I think products like the power wall are seriously under utilized currently and are gonna see a much larger market share growth over the more medium term ~10 years or so while tesla's car business probably takes a piece wise hair cut of 50% as everyone else catches up and cuts their piece of the pie.

* The car loses access to its map database for one reason or another. Its sensors and cameras can see where its going and whats happening but...*where is it going*?
* The car loses traction due to ice, snow, whatever? Does it disable auto pilot when I'm sideways? Does it know how to drive through the issue? Every single traction issue will play out similarly yet be vastly different.
* What about the weight? Tesla code as written will behave very differently in a bus/semi due to size and weight, it'd need to be rewritten and relearned.
* Overall car functions? Different tire pressures and sizes can have an affect on how the car drives, how does the AI handle it? What if some customer is a doorknob and lets their tire pressure get low? Brake pads are metal on metal? Gearbox is fucked up or overheating? Happens all the time on peoples commutes. Will it monitor for signs and shut off unless repaired? Is this feature going to be only for rich people?
* Continuing on the cost I can tell you a Mercedes Radar sensor is near 2k customer cost, what happens when two or three of them need replaced outside warranty? Will people fork over their money or forgo the self driving feature?

* The car loses traction due to ice, snow, whatever? Does it disable auto pilot when I'm sideways? Does it know how to drive through the issue? Every single traction issue will play out similarly yet be vastly different.
* What about the weight? Tesla code as written will behave very differently in a bus/semi due to size and weight, it'd need to be rewritten and relearned.
* Overall car functions? Different tire pressures and sizes can have an affect on how the car drives, how does the AI handle it? What if some customer is a doorknob and lets their tire pressure get low? Brake pads are metal on metal? Gearbox is fucked up or overheating? Happens all the time on peoples commutes. Will it monitor for signs and shut off unless repaired? Is this feature going to be only for rich people?
* Continuing on the cost I can tell you a Mercedes Radar sensor is near 2k customer cost, what happens when two or three of them need replaced outside warranty? Will people fork over their money or forgo the self driving feature?

As a whole I think the industry will move towards automation, but it'll be 20-30 years before everyone is running around in an AI driven EV in my opinion, and that might be optimistic. These are my bear thesis thoughts in about 5 minutes time, I'm sure I'm missing another half dozen. This is just a problem with self driving automation of a car, not even mentioning Tesla or Nio as a company. For many those ideas are already priced into the valuation. That said do I think Tesla or Nio is going to go up from here in 10 years time? Of course, buy that shit if you like the company or the sector. Do I think tesla is going to 5x again in 10 years time? No, but its Tesla so probably yes, its stupid at this point but just buy it. At some time this will be worth more than the whole financial industry or retail sector if we keep 10xing.

It’s cheaply valued. It almost seems too good to be true. And because in large cap stocks the efficiency of the market is almost all the time on fleek, there is a reason why the market attributes a huge discount to the stock.

From what I see or would assume is that this discount has its roots in the fact that it’s a Chinese Company. 
If we measured the company by the ration e.g. amazon has (and amazon has these measurements rightly so), BABA would be worth double or triple it’s current market cap. 
The reason for this discount is the political circumstances and the CCP.

If the CCP wanted, they could delist BABA, split it for antitrust reasons or for whatever reason they can make up, ban foreign investors from investing, prohibit the ADR rules or just simply destroy and dissolve the company. Not because there is a legal background to do so but just because it’s the CCP and China has basically no rule of law. 

So the valuation of BABA is kinda arbitrary, you could assign it a 10 P/E, a 20 P/E, a 40 P/E or like amazon a 80 P/E. Everything is possible and it’s valuation is completely arbitrary. 

So what prevents me from investing in Chinese ADRs is exactly this political factor that with the blink of an eye China could destroy the entire value for shareholders. We basically only hold a shell company with no substance whatsoever. 

And that btw is the same with all other ADRs from China (every China based stock is an ADR).

1065,PS," All things considered nuclear waste is already stored in containers... the co2 in the air has to be captured somehow, yet there isn’t much financial incentive to capture it. All I’m saying is that storing nuclear waste in a space as small as a football fields cannot possibly be as tedious as capturing the co2. The only promising technology to do so could be GMO plants that capture more co2, but that’s a distant technology at this point in time, and who knows what repercussions a plant like that could have on the earths ecosystem. It’s a pipe dream compared to nuclear. Plus there is such a reactor that recycles nuclear waste(molten salt reactor). There’s talk of other nuclear concepts that recycle waste as well that make it all the more efficient. People will eventually have to move away from gas/coal is the point I’m trying to make.

>Nuclear is the future

Except for natural gas, nothing is more expensive than nuclear. These plants will only be built if subsidies for fossil fuels (6% of GDP, huge!) are redirected to nuclear.

2. Personally I'm relatively new to investing and lost some money on certain stocks that many people were promoting, so that would be my first lesson do your own research and don't follow others blindly. 

3. Doing DD
I'm still learning to do this, but I'd say a big part if DD is fundamental analysis and identifying market sentiment.

4. Indicators.
I won't say, that the indicator I was using predicted the red market of today, but I was analysing a stock that I own, that was at +40% profit yesterday and the MACD indicator told me to sell, but I was like meh it's a longer term play for me anyway. Woke up to +9% today after not checking the markets yesterday.

5. Keeping up with the news.
If I knew that Powell was gonna talk today, I probably would have done some stuff differently (probably would've sold of a few stocks, that I am now bag holding for.

1198,GME," - Move away from Apps like RobinHood - buying is too easy, feels more like a casino or like buying stuff off Amazon. Move to Apps/ Services which force you to learn the terminologies (Market, Limit, Stop etc. at a bare bare minimum)

- Don’t track your investment everyday. But do track and follow any news related to the companies/ sector etc you are invested in. In short, don’t open your trading app every single day/hour. Markets are bound to go up/ down. Not every day is a bull market.

- Don’t pull all your eggs in one basket. Diversify across stocks, ETFs, bonds, assets etc.. Even if you think Tesla is f***** incredible, putting all your money into just Tesla is plain stupid.

- Automate a portion of your investments into ETF’s, legit robo-advisors like Wealthfront. Let a small amount feed into both on a periodic basis, don’t touch it for several years to come.

- I do follow Motely Fool. If you don’t have time to research stocks and have a day job, MF is a good source for suggestions. The word “suggestions” is key. For their basic service, they come up with recommendations twice a month. I’ve been subscribed to them for a few years now, but even among their recommendations, I’ve invested in less than 10. What I’m trying to say is, you could follow stock advisor services from legit sources. For any recommendation, do a little bit of research to see if it is a stock you like, and understand. If yes, invest in that individual stock.

- Don’t gamble. DFV on wallstreetbets and GME may have both been legit stories, but for most common folks, by the time we notice the hype, the stock/asset is already way too expensive for its own good. Gamble money into such stories only with funds you don’t mind losing entirely.

- As a beginner, don’t jump into Options trading until you understand it completely.

Last, but not the least, I reiterate, don’t obsess over how the stock is moving every second or even every day. We are Cavemen with a cellphone (supercomputer) in our hands that’s wayyy too advanced for us. As cavemen, we are wired to run away from danger the moment we sense it. That’s what kept (most of) us from being prey. However strong your will power may be, we are wired to run away from a fire - stock markets crashing through a day/week/month with a big red indicator on our app is the example of such a fire.  The billionaires got where they are by not running away but by buying the right stocks when they are at a discount (when the market crashes).",BSwithConfidence,6,/r/stocks/comments/lqk3gj/how_do_you_convince_yourself_to_hold_long_term/goh2ekx/,0.049,0.882,0.069,0.6956
1199,BB," I had my savings in a fund and then only started dabbling in individual stocks last year, firstly with NIO and PLTR from r/wsb. Since then I've but bits of money all over the place and only recently have I moved most of my money over to individual stocks where now I'm far less tempted to take short term risks as it's most of my net worth and not just dabbling/gambling anymore.

I would say I'm much more in the mindset of longer term investing now after seeing all of the short term moves I used to do just be a failure. I remember going from like £1k to £3k on NIO and PLTR, and then lost all profits on margin to GME before Christmas. Then at different times I lost or made money on TLRY, BBBY, BB, SWPR, and others, but I basically was worrying every day and only came out even. So what was the point? I realised I was no good at it. Nowadays, I've got half my money in PSTH since I just have a high amount of confidence in that working out, and the rest I have in other some other stock picks. It's not diversified very well but for example I'm sat here looking at significant losses on BB and PLTR and not worrying about it at all since I wholeheartedly believe they'll be up by the end of 2021 or beyond.

Alternatively, I may just feel much more comfortable based on part of the story I didn't mention. I did put my whole savings (£20k) on GME at $50 a share in January just because you could see the hype coming and it was a once in a lifetime opportunity, rode it all the way to the top and back down until I sold for £40k. Anyway I used to think that investing my initial £20k in fund and getting 10% a year was basically pathetic and not worth it. However, now I've already doubled it and it's still only February, I know it'd still be a success to not make any more gains in 2021 and finish with £40k, which is why I don't mind at all letting it all sit in some longer term investments because I'm not worried about how I don't have enough savings. I think it's just a perception thing because I clearly have more than a lot of people to begin with but only feel comfortable after having made some profits.",ickapol,1,/r/stocks/comments/lqk3gj/how_do_you_convince_yourself_to_hold_long_term/gogv6x1/,0.074,0.794,0.132,0.9798

One way to convince yourself to hold long-term is to think about the tax consequences. If you hold for longer than a year, then you get taxed signifcantly less. I find that once you’re holding a stock for that long, the temptation to sell or do anything is gone. You can still check it regularly.

I find this helps to keep you from dwelling on ""what if"" scenarios. Yeah, there will always be times when you could have bought lower or sold higher, but if you can always assure yourself that you got a good deal then there's not much to be upset about.

And after today, seeing the whole cannabis sector go red with some of the big players having double digit losses, I'm even more convinced I made the right move.

If you intend to go long on a stock, take your time. Check the charts and dive in when you see weakness in the price, usually after a period of low volatility.

1240,DOW," I personally have been outpacing the DOW and S&P within the last rolling year. (Not sure about the NASDAQ) By a pretty good margin. Not outrageously, but enough to kind of feel good knowing I’ve been beating the index. 

Indexing is just a good way to be in the market and be diversified enough to where there’s little chance you’ll get wrecked. Good for people who don’t want the hassle of stock picking. 

What I do that’s apparently been beating the market is stick exclusively to companies that I’ve deemed are undervalued fundamentally. Find sectors and companies that have gotten scorched.

1244,GME," Posted this a month ago during the GME madness, I feel it still applies.

This isn't the Dotcom, and at the moment there's no indications of a greater crash incoming. Correction sure...crash, probably not.

The Dotcom was was just pure FOMO from every end of the market (institutional and retail), this is different in that the institutions still seem to have their heads on straight and are not feeding the fire. Are valuations stretched thin? Sure. But pay attention to market news, everyone seems to be well aware and tracking that a correction is immanent.

So why did the Dotcom burst? Tons of factors, none of which are in play at the moment. 

First and foremost, a lot of the pumped assets during the Dotcom bubble went bankrupt overnight. People were investing in companies that were operating out of parking garages, expecting them to scale to meet massive expectations. Poor managment, logistics issues, supply chain managment, you name it, these companies couldn't get their shit together and *boom* they started to evaporate overnight, which led lenders and venture capitalists to rethink their strategies. Once the free money dried up, the party was over.

Second, the FED. There was a ton of money being lent, and the FED decided they wanted a piece of the pie. This is what initially upset the market as lending dried up when the FED raised intrest rates and startups burned through remaining capital like toilet paper.

Third, 9/11, Black Swan, the markets absolutly shat themselves on 9/11. Nothing more to add here. Note that this happened after the Dotcom crash, but it corellated to drag down the recovery.

Fourth, Worldcom, Enron, and the SOX act. Ah yes, the market death blow. Companies got caught cooking the books hard, and the US Government regulated harder. Market confidence was shook, and the SOX act required companies self-regulate their accounting which was seen (at the time) as a huge expense to the bottom line. Again, suppressed any chance of a quick recovery.

So when people say ""The Docom bubble popped"" what they really mean is a series of unconnected but extremely bearish events that hit the market over a short time span. Alone any one of them would have probably spured a correction at best, or a short crash and recovery in the case of 9/11. Combined they led to the what most now reflect upon as the Dotcom crash and the rest is history.

So I guess what I'm trying to say is, hang in there...don't chase FOMO, invest in solid companies with solid books...this is just a bump in the road right now.",Banned_by_WSB_thrice,34,/r/stocks/comments/lqodfi/nasdaq_recovery_from_dot_com_bubble/gohjnb1/,0.075,0.834,0.09,0.7176
1245,IMO," >Could something similar happen in 2021?

yes. tech companies today (generally speaking) are in a stronger position than 20 years ago. more revenue, etc. but it could still take a long time to recover from any crash. 

the US market was basically flat through most of the 1970s. the Japanese Nikkei index was flat for years and only recently recovered to its peak. 

younger investors have become accustomed to an endlessly-rising  bull market with quick v-shaped recoveries. but historically that's an anomaly. 

>but it you need to hold for more than 15 years to just break even that's clearly not a good strategy in this instance.

depends on your holding period. if you're 30, ride it out IMO. if you're 60, consider shifting to lower volatility options.",harrison_wintergreen,2,/r/stocks/comments/lqodfi/nasdaq_recovery_from_dot_com_bubble/gohxdwl/,0.07,0.876,0.053,-0.5038

I actually think the market is going to dip when stimulus checks come out because that's when a lot of investors will think that prices have peaked for the short term and jump ship, overselling whatever new buying power the checks bring. I think it's similar to how recently any earnings report (good or bad) led to prices dropping for a little while. Whenever that happens, people say ""it's classic buy the rumor, sell the news"", yet they don't seem to think the same thing might happen in a year when the stimulus checks are deposited and the government is quenching relief aid only to leave people holding overvalued stocks. My philosophy is that in order to survive a correction or bear market, you have to see it coming before others do. Because by then it's too late.

I'd still buy ICLN over trying to pick individual winners, or even niche-sectors like TAN or FAN – simply because ""old"" energy and utilities are, and will, naturally play a big part in the transition, and you get a fair share of utilities and utility-like tickers in ICLN.

Personally – I sold half my ICLN with a slight gain, and picked up an MSCI world energy ETF a while back to hedge my green bet. So I feel comfortable riding out the correction over the next months. If I wasn't invested at all, I'd pick up a bit of world energy now, and wait until the rotation into post-COVID is over, before looking at ICLN again.

I'd recommend: 

(a) trim/consolidate the ICLN and ARK positions. Nothing from ARK has more than a 10-year track record, and there's a strong chance part of Cathie Wood's success is just riding the bull market. She's never been tested by a protracted downturn. a total market index like VTI is already dominated by tech stocks like Apple and Facebook that make up 25% of the index. 

and (b) look at adding some combination of broad exposure to small/mid cap, value stocks, and international. mid/small tends to outperform large cap over time. value stocks tend to outperform growth stocks over time (this is especially pronounced in smaller and mid size companies). and international tends to run in cycles with the US where one outperforms for a while and then underperforms.

1291,CEO," I am sorry to inform you, but evaluating management is probably one of the most important aspect of investing.  you think Microsoft without Bill Gates, Intel without Andy Grove, Disney without Michael Eisner and Bob Iger would have had the success they had without good managers.  how many business would have been better if they had a better manager, or think of it as a sports team with a coach, coaches make a difference as well as managers.  why do you think stock trade down when a great CEO is stepping down, or when one come to replace a CEO of an ailing company.

1294,USA," The S&P500 is a good choice (very low fees) but bear in mind being 100% stocks on USA it is more risky than a mixed bond fund.

You can always choose a Global All Cap ETF or even a mixed stocks/bonds fund (Lifestrategy funds) for something more stable.",trillo69,1,/r/stocks/comments/lqgfmp/vanguard_isa_baby_steps/gogf3ma/,0.085,0.81,0.105,0.25
1295,NIO," I like your approach.  I think it makes a lot of sense. 

Ignore the advice about a target retirement fund.  These are overly conservative and you can do a lot better just putting money into VOO if you want a ""set it and forget it"" type of investment.  That said, I would consider the following approach:

* Put some into a broad market fund like **VOO** or **QQQM**. 
* Put some into a broad market ETF that focuses on small cap or mid-cap companies. My choice here is **IWM**.  This fund uses the Russell 2000 index as its benchmark.
* Put some into a global or emerging markets ETF.  My choice for this one is **VXUS**, Vanguard's Emerging markets fund.
* Choose a few sector funds like **ICLN**.  A couple that don't get mentioned that I like are **XITK**, **XLY**, and **SOXX**.

My approach is this:  For those funds you want to put into ETFs (rather than individual stocks), allocate about 60 percent into the broad market funds:  20% into **VOO** or similar, 20% into the emerging markets and 20% into a small- or mid-cap market fund.  With the remaining 40% of your allocation, put 10% each into sector funds, like the ARK funds or the ones I've mentioned above.  This is a good way to diversify your portfolio with minimal crossover, while maintaining a good opportunity for growth and for outperforming the overall market.

A few notes in sector funds:

I like ICLN and the green/renewable energy market, in general.  That said, ICLN is a global fund and it focuses more on Europe and Asia than on the US. While that may change over the next few years with the current administration making an effort to boost this sector, **PBW** has been my fund of choice for green/renewable energy in the US.  It has outperformed every other renewable energy ETF that I've found and while it does have some money in NIO and a few other foreign companies, it is heavily titled towards US equities. I think this will be the better performing renewable energy ETF going forward.  

**XITK** is a tech-sector ETF, but it focuses on emerging, disruptive companies (similar to the approach ARK uses). However, it is an indexed ETF with a much lower expense ratio. It's 52 week performance is slightly better than WCLD, a reddit favorite. Check out the top 10 holdings of this one and do our own due-diligence.

**XLY** is a Consumer Discretionary sector fund that over-weights the highest market cap stocks in the sector.  Currently it is 22% Amazon and 17% Tesla.  But the other holdings in the fund are all solid performers, as well.  There would be that bit of crossover with your current portfolio, but it still might be one to consider. 

**SOXX** is an ETF that invests in Semiconductor technology.  There are a handful of other ETFs that invest in this sector, as well, but this one seems to outperform them.",ixamnis,2,/r/stocks/comments/lqadnf/looking_for_better_etfs_for_longterm_investing/gogu08j/,0.018,0.878,0.103,0.9816

They do charge for real-time market data and it’s expensive.

Admiral Markets charge 0.02/share min $1 (don’t know max) and also has an inactivity fee of $10 BUT ONLY if you don’t trade within 2 years.
It has free L1 market data.

I use Admiral Markets as I think IB market data is ridiculously high and don’t like the activity fees, the one problem I found is AM doesn’t seem to have access to all the stocks at least not the SPACs.",Den-Hemmelige,1,/r/stocks/comments/lq7u3i/is_an_18_usd_brokerage_fee_per_buy_order_from_my/goffybe/,0.072,0.82,0.108,0.7684

1314,IRL," I don't know any specific stocks, but in general for these competitions you want to look for stocks with high ""beta"". 

beta is the measure of a stock's price volatility relative to the market as a whole. the US market has a beta of 1, which you'll find in an S&P500 fund or total-market index like VTSAX. 

high beta stocks are anything with a beta above 1.5 or 2. there are some penny stocks with a beta of 3-5 or more, which will swing up and down like crazy. IRL, this strategy will probably burn your butt. but if you pick half a dozen high-beta stocks, half of them will tank and the other half will shoot through the roof over the next 4 months.",harrison_wintergreen,1,/r/stocks/comments/lqed39/school_stock_project/gogtb2a/,0.049,0.888,0.063,0.1901
