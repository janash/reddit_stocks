0,DD," Value Line is free through most Libraries.  It's $500 a year, but I can access it at home through my library website. 

You know it's good when their stock screener only works with internet explorer.

Edit: due to many questions below.

I have used VL for ~20 years.  
In a prior life, I was a Design Engineer at a medical device company.  Once a week (maybe 2x), the VP of Investor relations would schedule a 1 hour meeting with me to take a representative from a Hedge Fund / Bank / Rich Person through our Design Lab.  I would detail how we designed our products, how they perform against the competition, why certain features are included or not included, and even insight into what we are doing for future work.  Those people would learn information not on our website or quarterly reports.  In a way, they received insider information.  

When looking to invest funds into a company, I find it important to read restricted information about that company.  VL's commentary is pretty great.  VL not only reviews a couple thousand companies each quarter (new releases weekly), but they also rate and rank them on several categories including how safe they are, their financial stability, and the expected future growth. They make their own ""portfolios"" you can match if trying to achieve a similar goal to their portfolio mission.  

So... Go ahead and read a DD on WSB, but I like to also weigh it against VL's view.",Why_Am_I_Itchy34,294,/r/stocks/comments/okgqbb/how_to_find_professional_stock_analysis_on_the/h588doj/,0.013,0.838,0.149,0.9877

27,MP," MP is the best miner long term imo. Or you could go with REMX as someone else mentioned for all the rare earth metal miners. 

The short bull thesis is this: Rare earth metals are a vital resource and will become even more important as the world shifts toward EV. REEs (rare earth elements) are also used in defense and other technologies. Currently about 80% of REEs are mined in China. There are only 2 operational mines outside China in the world, an Australian mine ran by a company called Lynas, and MP materials. MP is based in Cali and holds the rights to one of, if not the highest, the highest yield mines in the world. 

The reason MP is so attractive has very little to do with the business itself but geopolitical factors. China and the US are entering Cold War 2.0 and REEs will be part of that war. As China's demand for REEs grows, they will sell less and less to the US forcing them to get their metals elsewhere aka MP because for the time being they're the only miner available. MP has a massive first mover advantage and they're planning on building facilities to process the REEs they mine allowing them to vertically integrate almost the entire operation. 

In short: China-USA relations will affect the rare earth market making MP the only viable choice for the US's REE needs as China continues to reduce the amount of REEs sold to foreign countries, especially the US.",jand999,2,/r/stocks/comments/oktdoc/mining_stocks_thread_i_want_to_invest_in_mining/h5aoldo/,0.047,0.907,0.045,-0.6791

31,GOLD," Novo Resources Corp. OTCMKTS: NSRPF. Canadian company mining gold primarily in Australia. 

Witwatersrand gold mine, the worlds largest gold rush. Geologists speculate that after the tectonic plates began to separate millions of years ago, the gold mine was split. Where did the other half end up? Australia, and Novo has permits on the land. Further, they have a specialized process that allows for higher gold recovery and more efficient conglomerate mining. If you feel inclined to conduct some research, Witswatersrand, PILBARA GOLD, and Purdy's Reward.  

Some company numbers from their quarterly operations report: 
- Record gold production of 5,898 oz Au in June, a 16.5% increase over May (Q2 2021 – 14,890 oz Au) 

- June revenue of C$11.9 million (A$12.8 million), an 11.4% increase over May (Q2 2021 – C$31.7 million (A$33.1 million)) 

- Operational positive cash flow from Nullagine Gold Project achieved in May and June 

- Mining and processing rates continued to increase, with 232 kt gold-bearing conglomerate material mined in June (Q2 2021 – 477 kt gold-bearing conglomerate material mined) and 134 kt gold-bearing conglomerate material processed in June (Q2 – 366 kt gold-bearing conglomerate material processed) 

- Recovery rates reaching optimal levels, with June recovery of 96.4%, up from 94.4% in May 
Significant cost saving and operational improvements, including flight sharing arrangements 

- Quarter-end cash balance of C$46.3 million. The fair value of Novo’s investments also increased to approximately C$200 million1 (Q1 2021 balance – approximately C$77 million2)",thunderousqueef,1,/r/stocks/comments/oktdoc/mining_stocks_thread_i_want_to_invest_in_mining/h5ar9ng/,0.0,0.86,0.14,0.9839

55,AAPL," my thoughts on PLTR:

1. it launched at $8 or so late last year, meaning we're still up 3x from that price. the stock still needs a bit of time to digest those gains
2. short term price action is just noise. even the best companies have had severe drawdowns. look at AAPL from 2015-2016, when everyone claimed it was a dead company. and yet, Buffett bought it, Tim Apple kept delivering and here we are at ATH again and everyone is super bullish. over the long run, good companies consistently growing revenue/profits tend to go up and to the right regardless of crappy investor sentiment and sell offs
3. Karp has guided 30% (or higher) growth for the next 5 YEARS. you dont do that unless you are pretty dang confident in your contract backlog
4. if you believe this is a great company for the long term, why would you worry about what happens in a 1 month time frame? if a stock i own has been selling off like crazy, i always ask myself: has the company changed fundamentally? and would i buy it right now, if i was sitting on cash and had no position already?
5. almost always i realize i would 100% buy it, so i sit on my position (or add more) and ignore the volatility
6. my biggest gripe with PLTR is the stock based compensation. it is pretty excessive, even for a tech company. this means that there is a lot of dilution and selling from employees as those options vest. Karp doesnt have a large salary, but he is still one of the highest paid CEOs because of his SBC. this isnt necessarily a bad thing -- Elon notoriously got paid $0 salary and instead opted for his outrageously ambitious SBC plan with Tesla price targets in the stratosphere that CNBC and Bloomberg assured us was ridiculous and would never work. as it turns out, he is now one of the richest guys in the world",Turlututu_2,4,/r/stocks/comments/okdjqk/thoughts_on_pltr/h58tea0/,0.056,0.83,0.113,0.9596

If you're day trading, look at min to hour micro trends. Swing trading would be days or weeks. Investing would be years.
You said you bought for long term. Your earlier 15% gain is just as irrelevant to the current -9%. I'd suggest focusing on monthly average price.

I'll leave this here from ToS on their market cap division in case anyone wants to see it;

> Facebook Ads are primarily self-serve ads that appear on News Feed and the right hand column of most Facebook pages and can be highly targeted to appear to specific users. The Facebook ad system is mostly self-serve and provides real-time feedback on the size of the target audience and the suggested bid range to achieve impressions. The system is based on a live auction model, which means that the more advertisers are willing to spend per impression, the more frequently their ad will appear.

> The Facebook self-serve ad system offers very powerful targeting capabilities: when advertisers create an ad, they have the option to limit who sees the ad by age, sex, location, keywords, education level, workplaces, political views and relationship status. Facebook Social Ads are limited in that they contain only a small static image and a few lines of text.

> Facebook gives advertisers the opportunity to advertise on its website pages, and target users based on demographics such as age, gender, education and location. These advertisements show up on the Facebook site pages alongside profile and other user related data.

> Facebook also allows large advertisers to form custom fan page profiles. Custom fan page is an effective form of advertising as it allows users to send stories related to an advertisers' custom fan page to their friends via news feed. This creates viral effect and is an effective marketing tool for advertisers.

> Facebook makes money based on how many pages are visited and the rates on which these advertisements are bid for. Facebook offers both Cost per Click (CPC), for which advertisers pay only when users actually click on the advertisement, and Cost per Thousand Impressions (CPM), for which advertisers pay based on the number of times these advertisements are displayed on user pages. The company also makes money through runnning ads on Instagram, Messenger, and third-party affiliated websites or mobile applications.

> Who is buying?

> Advertising networks like SocialMedia, Sharethrough; Small and large corporations.

154,BB," I’ve seen that article too but as far as I’ve seen international sales are increasing w/ domestic stagnating and if they can take hold of more of the international market it could bode well for future revenue if they can beat out Samsung, oppo and xiaomi for Asian sales. (Worldwide of smartphones increased 27% in the 1st quarter of this year) Apple came out the other day with plans to increase production capacity by 20%, whatever their internal numbers show must have led them to believe that they will have need for that increased capacity which IMO is a fairly bullish signal. Seems to me like they’re positioning to break further into those markets which have historically been more inclined towards samsung etc. 


Granted it’s up to everyone to interpret the current info independently/do their own DD and can totally see how someone may take a more pessimistic view but I would caution basing your assumption on a chart which ends at 2018 and doesn’t account for smartphone sales growth in international markets which Apple is yet to establish a strong foothold in.

155,DD," I’ve seen that article too but as far as I’ve seen international sales are increasing w/ domestic stagnating and if they can take hold of more of the international market it could bode well for future revenue if they can beat out Samsung, oppo and xiaomi for Asian sales. (Worldwide of smartphones increased 27% in the 1st quarter of this year) Apple came out the other day with plans to increase production capacity by 20%, whatever their internal numbers show must have led them to believe that they will have need for that increased capacity which IMO is a fairly bullish signal. Seems to me like they’re positioning to break further into those markets which have historically been more inclined towards samsung etc. 


Granted it’s up to everyone to interpret the current info independently/do their own DD and can totally see how someone may take a more pessimistic view but I would caution basing your assumption on a chart which ends at 2018 and doesn’t account for smartphone sales growth in international markets which Apple is yet to establish a strong foothold in.

People have seen them run up and that scares people to invest.  They see Google is basically at all time highs.   But what they do not get is these companies have really barely even got started.

Google is the one with the most valuable assets yet to be fully monetized.    

YouTube for example has tons and tons of runway and will pass Netflix in size this year because it is growing so much faster.

So basically Alphabet has a company, Google, which has a unit called YouTube which stand alone will be bigger than all of Netflix in 2021!

That’s one example but I’m sure there are many others. The trouble is things not at all time highs are often looked at dubiously. I just posted something that got several responses about ICLN being a bad investment because it has mostly fallen this year.

348,ATH," Nvidia could, as in nobody has the crystal ball, but it could drop quite hard after split, as it increased quite a buttload without bringing anything new to the table except for the split that doesn't really change things for company.

440,EM," Bullish

1: Governments are determined to keep the economy growing. They won’t try and moderate the boom this time.

2: Positive demographics in the world, specifically in Asia and EM.

3: Minimum wages are rising in the US, putting money in the hands of those most likely to spend it.

4: Even ignoring 2020 earnings and demand is up across the board.

5: Boomers are dying and leaving all their savings to millennials, who can and will (probably) spend the money.

6: I’m working on a 30+ year timeframe, so I’m always bullish.

444,GD," 1: 1,1. Something isn't crazy because you disagree with it, and Keynesian economics ain't about the government solving all our problems, but the idea that government intervention can help prevent or limit the severity of recessions. If you read a book on the great depression you may remember that it was the governments' refusal to act that allowed the great depression to become so bad and that it was only when the government finally acted that things started to improve once again. At the time of the GD the fed was still in its infancy and essentially irrelevant.   
1.2: The Great Recession wasn't caused by governments or central banks, but by banks accidentally and unknowingly interlocking their economies so that a single factor could cause massive disruption. The factor turned out to be reckless lending and borrowing by both banks and citizens alike. Something that is in no way the case today. None of the factors that cause the great depression or the great recession are present today. So the odds of a repeat are minimal.  
1.3We have plenty of bullets left in the gun. Direct spending is the most obvious one. I can't describe the rest of them here in a way that does them justice.  


2. Yes they are. Overall in the world there are more young people, and the middle class is getting larger and richer across the world, but especially in emerging markets. Yes the age demographic isn't looking too great in the western and westernized nations right now, but when the boomers die the situation will look much less severe, and the positive trends in the rest of the world will boost the western economies as well.  


3: Sorry, I mean Wages for low income families are rising. Without going into too much detail the thought process goes something like this. Higher wages in the low end will mean two things. Poor people have more money to spend, and prices rise in the professions where low income workers work, which mean they become better able to afford mid range services, effectively redistributing wealth that wouldn't otherwise have been spent, from the rich (as they will spend proportionally more on ""low cost"" services, to low income households, that will spend the money, effectively increasing the velocity of money, which will increase the total amount of wealth circulating in society.  


4: Good points, but both the [Median and average wealth](https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/average-american-net-worth?r=US&IR=T) is about 2.5 times higher for 75 year olds as for 35 year olds, which is significant. Median net worth is also 250k, for 75+.

445,TDOC," You're focusing too much on stock price. As Bezos famously said the stock is not the company and the company is not the stock. This remark was made in regards to the share price of Amazon falling from $113 to $6 over the course of a year during the dot com crash. The stock was sliding as Amazon reported 169% in revenue growth for the year and more than doubled it's number of customers. TDOC, the company, is doing just as well now as it was when it was $300 a share. 

The telehealth market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 37.7% to reach $191 billion by 2025. $TDOC is the industry leader in visit volume and providers on their platform. Stands to reason they will capture a large share of that opportunity. As someone else said - Livongo is Teladoc's differentiator in this space but they offer a whole suite of solutions beyond it. It is likely selling off due to it being seen as a 'covid stock' and conservative guidance from management on last earnings but this is all transient.

If you were really smart you would open and max out a I-ROTH with a S&P 500 ETF. Then when you turn 59 and 1/2 you can switch it over to a dividend ETF and all the dividends that come out of it will be tax free. If you start in your early 20's you'll easily be a millionaire by that time.

486,IMO," If you don’t need the money in the next ~many years, should be 100% in risk assets.

People on reddit will balk at this, but as a 20-ish year old your investment returns not only need to compete with inflation, they need to compete with future wage gains (that WILL happen).  This means that your baseline “discount rate” you need to compete against with your investments will be very high.  So you need to have a high % return to make your savings worth it.

Why?

Well, one data point that’s interesting is that the average 55 year old earns 5x more than a 25 year old.  So, if you put 100 dollars into savings when you’re 25, that’s the same level of sacrifice as waiting and saving 500 dollars when you’re 55.  So, if you get a return that’s less than 5-6% you’re actually not really moving yourself forward.  Add 2% inflation on top of that and that’s 7-8%.  So, if you’re 25 and saving, you really need to be targeting at least a 10-12% rate of return to make it worthwhile.  That’s right on the edge of what indexing will get you…so IMO you need to really ratchet up that risk in your investments when you’re younger.  If it doesn’t work out, you can always save more when you’re older and you make more money.

As you get older this math changes as you reach your terminal income, then indexing makes more sense.  But when you’re young and a long way away from your max earning potential you shouldn’t be making low risk investments unless you really think you need the money at some point in the near future.",deadjawa,5,/r/stocks/comments/okuqua/what_percentage_of_your_portfolio_would_you_put/h5ahhcr/,0.032,0.887,0.081,0.9224

499,RH," So this isn’t exactly right.... pretty much every institutional investor uses dark pools for almost all order flow big or large. Banks have proprietary hybrid algos that trade orders half in dark pools and half “out loud” and those are used almost exclusively unless an order is a being traded according to another algo (VWAP/TWAP). 

Really big orders are traded in blocks high touch because dark pools still suck liquidity out of the market and can move stock prices. 

Also when you send your orders to RH, Fidelity, whoever they’re all institutional and either sell your flow to someone bigger or use dark pools to trade their books. 

But to OPs question u/document10 you can’t really as a retail investor hit up a dark pool if you like.

514,AI," Google completely dominates search which means Google is basically the gatekeeper for information to 92% of the population and actually slightly increasing.  I also believe more people touch Google on a daily basis than any other company by a decent margin.

While their chief competitor, Microsoft, lost over 10% of their Bing market share in the last year.

https://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share

That is dominating something that is also crazy valuable.  I really can't think of anything more valuable.  Information is power.   Controlling the flow of information is even better.   But it is just one thing Google dominates.   YouTube is another perfect example of totally dominating something.   YouTube this year, stand alone, will pass the entire Netflix in revenue this year!

But the list goes on and on.  Android has over 75% share and the most popular operating system used.   Gmail is easily the most popular email service by a wide margin.  Chrome is most popular.   The most popular AI framework is TensorFlow by Google.      Google actually now has 9 different products/services that have over a billion active users.

515,TV," Google completely dominates search which means Google is basically the gatekeeper for information to 92% of the population and actually slightly increasing.  I also believe more people touch Google on a daily basis than any other company by a decent margin.

While their chief competitor, Microsoft, lost over 10% of their Bing market share in the last year.

That is dominating something that is also crazy valuable.  I really can't think of anything more valuable.  Information is power.   Controlling the flow of information is even better.   But it is just one thing Google dominates.   YouTube is another perfect example of totally dominating something.   YouTube this year, stand alone, will pass the entire Netflix in revenue this year!

But the list goes on and on.  Android has over 75% share and the most popular operating system used.   Gmail is easily the most popular email service by a wide margin.  Chrome is most popular.   The most popular AI framework is TensorFlow by Google.      Google actually now has 9 different products/services that have over a billion active users.

Google does not only own the most popular web site in the world but they also have the second most popular.

516,PSTH," UMG (Universal Music Group) absolutely dominatea the music industry. they have signed the top 10/10 musicians worldwide, 38.5% market share and huge streaming growth from Spotify. (15% CAGR for streaming revenue in the last 5 years. and that's the highest margin business of UMG so this growth is awesome)


content is king, imo. Spotify can get disrupted more easily than UMG.


UMG is not yet publicly traded, but you can buy PSTH (a SPAC) to get access to UMG shares for a great valuation.


the transactions of PSTH in the near future are very complicated, so it's hard to get a good picture of its value (they don't spend all their cash on UMG but only ~72%. the remainder cash will spinoff into a smaller blank check company that is in talks with other businesses right now. you also get 2 different kind of warrants).

531,AMZN," Yes, it's possible. My trading group has done it many times. The problem right now is that extremely high valuations, panic over inflation, and Chinese manipulation of metals (among other things) has created an environment where upside potential is low, and downside potential is huge. Swing trading with common shares isn't the best way to try to make money in these market conditions. Options trading gives you far greater control and safety. But, in general, the shorter the time frame, the more risk that you need to take on.

For example, last Thursday, we did something that we call the Jamazon strategy. In nine minutes, I booked $505.29 on an AMZN option play. I repeated this twice, yesterday, to add $396. The Jamazon is a high-risk, extremely short-term strategy that I wouldn't advise for most people. (You need to be intimately familiar with macroeconomics, AMZN's minute price action, understand how to discern price action possibilities from technical analysis, and have impeccable timing, with superb execution skills.)

We've done Jamazons by collecting data and analyzing descriptive statistics to design the actual play. Most people probably wouldn't want to do the level of planning work that we go through, for a relatively small reward, but it always feels good to win. Also, never underestimate the power of luck.

If you insist on swing trading common shares, if my life depended on it, I would advise you to try IMGN right now. (I wouldn't normally recommend a pre-profitable small-cap company in these market conditions, but this one looks to be a rare, undiscovered stock with a margin of safety from patent sales and a strong pipeline, with a powerful near-term catalyst.) It moves slowly, even pleasingly, so there aren't any sudden and dramatic surprises. It has a very powerful catalyst toward the end of September: the release of (positive) Phase III results for a very specific form of ovarian cancer. We're getting strong signs that we're going to see good news, and that the share price will fly. Now is the best time to get in, but realize that the price could drift down to about $5.75/share again. I've been steadily accumulating shares, and have shorted PUTs on it that strike at $5.00/share and $6.00/share, and expire in October.

I know that 2.5 months is longer than you want to wait, but the shorter the time period, the less you're making a strong bet, and the more you're gambling, usually. Most of the time, that doesn't end well for the trader.

The fact is that the market conditions are very challenging. If you do want to swing trade, you need to do it within the three week periods after the monthly CPI report is released, and before the weeklong panic-driven run-down to the next month's release happens. You need to be very cautious about JPow (Jerome Powell) speeches and testimonies, FOMC meetings, and, to a lesser degree, monthly unemployment reports. A poor cluster of bank or other industry earnings releases could pose another challenge with regard to timing.

One more thing. Indicators are a pipe dream. All you need is price action and, secondarily, volume. People want some easy trading system based on technical analysis, but the truth is that technical analysis (specifically, support and resistance lines) only tell you what might happen, not what's likely to happen. If you want to make the strongest possible bet, you need a financially healthy company that's temporarily trading below its mean share price over a given period of time (more than one month), so that we can expect a regression to the mean, i.e. a move up. Ideally, you want a potent catalyst with a specific date. You also want the technicals to align with the fundamentals. Then, you want to see the share price trending up. You can be fooled into thinking that there's a one-day, or one-week, trend, but that's usually too short of a period to know that there's a real trend. At that point, buy some shares, see if the price keeps moving up, and buy some more. Scale in. But set stop losses and exit at the first sign of trouble. Even the very best traders who do this are wrong 50% of the time. They (we) make money by managing risk.

If you want to learn more, I'll give you one suggestion. Read the book, *The Art and Science of Technical Analysis* by Adam Grimes. There's a workbook that you can buy, too. That's not enough, because you still need to learn how to interpret data and calculate various ratios using the data on financial statements. The idea is to tilt the odds in your favor by making sure that many different factors align.

RSI and MACD will not help you to win trades. If it were that simple, no one would ever lose money. The trading journey involves learning macroeconomics, something about banking and finance, financial accounting to be able to understand and analyze financial statements, technical analysis, descriptive statistics (and how to use the R programming language), and portfolio theory. Different people are at different points in the learning journey. If you have any specific questions, feel free to private message me.

Good luck in your journey, and be careful.

The trading journey involves learning macroeconomics, something about banking and finance, financial accounting to be able to understand and analyze financial statements, technical analysis, descriptive statistics (and how to use the R programming language), and portfolio theory. Different people are at different points in the learning journey. If you have any specific questions, feel free to private message me.

Good luck in your journey, and be careful.

541,HSBC," In my opinion Financials are a great bet, our modern economy is built on debt and many financial firms are in the business of debt. For banks in my opinion the Two commercial/investment banking mixes would bet on the most are HSBC and Citi mainly for their international exposure especially to Asia where the Middle class is growing the most and will likely continue to grow. In straight investment banking Goldman is still king but morgan Stanley isn't far behind, I'm not as familiar with the boutiques like Evercore or Moelis. As for the private equity firms Blackstone is clearly the best because it invested the most in the cheap period from 2009-2014 and this sets it up for the best future returns However Apollo is the best insulated for rising rates as it has the largest credit business of the three, overall though all three big PE firms are good choices, however it is of note that private equity generally does worse in rising rate environment as their main LBO model is impacted negatively as they need to deal with higher borrowing costs. I'm not as invested in fintech mainly because I'm not as knowledgeable in that field, my favorite Stripe is still private, but I would definitely look into it if it IPOed.",ilai_reddead,2,/r/stocks/comments/okfy5t/financialsbanks_with_highest_upside/h57pqr8/,0.031,0.792,0.177,0.9904
542,KKR," I like MS, Blackstone and KKR. MS is dominating everywhere and is building out consumer lending more so will stand to benefit from a steep curve more than it has in the past. Blackstone and KKR for Alt lending as private credit should run hot but I also expect private equity markets to open up a bit more (potentially  in 401k’s) and they would be at the top of the list. Besides that, I’m just not really a fan of financials as regulations always hinder them and they’re just too cyclical for my liking.

551,BAC," BAC made profits but there may be idiosyncratic risk to the financial system that BAC has bankrolled and perpetuated. Smart money knows this and is not going to be bag holding. CNBC had a large push to get retail to buy the bank stock. They also raised dividends… if interest rates go up the theory is banks make more money.

However in an over-leveraged system the interest rate raise is also synonymous with risking an economic collapse like we saw at the start of covid.

Long story short the derivatives market is much larger than the actual market… 

When I saw housing in rural Canada (no jobs more than 20$ and hour doing construction) went to 800k from 250k a year before. Everything is on the edge of lunacy for someone born the 2000s being able to make it without inter-generational wealth.  

No rational person can pay that mortgage making 20$ an hour… and if prices go down many over-leveraged assets will fall back to prices people can pay for them with 5% interest rates. Not free money rolled every year when the owners re-finance to get more equity for a second or third home! 

The derivatives market is unregulated… it’s about to expose how the banks and financial institutions have run wild since 2008 and made a bigger mess (after the American population bailed those million/billionaires out of their bad bet)

Side note… covid stimmy should have been 20k per person and skipped the fucking corporations…. We just gave Americas Corporate Economy steroids for too long, were about to crash…",SpaceCatCapital,-3,/r/stocks/comments/okhg3w/why_did_bac_go_down_while_its_preferred_stock/h57wlkr/,0.103,0.811,0.086,-0.6316
