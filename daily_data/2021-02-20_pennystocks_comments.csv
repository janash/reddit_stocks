22,DD," To add to what others have said, yes this is how it works, and yes it goes in the opposite direction (i.e., you can easily lose your money as well if it crashes to $.001 instead). The gains and losses work the same way regardless of the share price. It's just that penny stocks tend to be much more volatile (especially on a day-to-day basis) than the stocks of generally developed and reputable companies.

One of the benefits of penny stocks, however, is that you can pick up 10,000 shares of a $0.001 stock for $10 and hold it indefinitely, sort of like ""set it and forget it."" If that company ever starts getting traction and the share price hits, let's say, $1, then you've turned $10 into $10,000. Hell, if the share price even hits $0.10, you've turned $10 into $1000.  If you do this with 100 different stocks (at the same $0.001 price), you've just spent $1,000 in the hopes that one of them manages to make it big and give you significant returns. Yes, there's always the chance that you managed to pick 100 losers, and they all disappear into the ether, but that's why you want to do your DD (due diligence) on what you're putting your money into. One of the nice things about this approach is that because you can choose so many different stocks, you can have some fun and dip into any interesting/riskier stocks.

There's obviously a lot more to it all, and finding a $0.001 stock that manages to make it to $1 is much harder than it sounds, but I hope this helps!",Iniwid,99,/r/pennystocks/comments/lo1a5g/everyone_in_rpennystocks_be_like/go4li4a/,0.039,0.816,0.145,0.9757

Thats a legitimate investment strategy though.

Last week it was crypto. Did some basic DD on some crypto stocks. Bought in, rode the wave to 30-50% gains, sold. 

Now I'm on to the next.

Sure, it's risky, but its a legitimate strategy. The key though is having an exit plan and getting the fuck out.

Just remember, you're ALWAYS missing out on good buys. Even if you're making good buys, there's always hidden gems or moon missions on the launch pad that you just don't see. FOMO is real. Set hard rules for yourself and collect lots of little gains instead of trying to get those massive multipliers. For every one person who turned their 400 dollars into 46k in a month from a penny stock, there's 100 people who lost out on that same stock.

Oh and one more BIG thing. If you see people making DDs or pushing a stock really hard, try and find out what they bought in at. So many times I have avoided buying a stock because I found the majority of people pushing it bought in at a very low price compared to what it is now. If they bought in at 56 cents and the stock is now 1.78, and they're telling YOU to buy it, that is a red flag. you are being caught up in a bag holder dragnet. Think about risk vs reward, for them they're already sitting on 150+% gains and you're at zero. You buy in and the stock drops, you're negative and theyre still over 100% gains.

But I started out trading a lot like you making some okay money. Worked up to about 20k before putting almost all of that into ALPP. Then reinvested al of those gains into IQST and MNXXF both of which I’m still holding. So I don’t have a daily goal right now I more have weekly/monthly goals. I’ve also had my fair share of smaller trades along the way which have helped add to my total.

I’m not sure there’s any one right way to go about it I’ll admit I’ve gotten quite lucky with my YOLOs but I also did very thorough DD on each before I committed that much money to any of them.

124,DD," mmmm it doesn't really have anything to do with the company, it's a matter of trading strategy. The DD they post needs to be legit or else the people on this sub will tear them a new ass, but that doesn't mean they need to be long in every stock they post about.

A person who invests in a stock and makes 120% profit makes *less* money than someone who invests the same amount, makes 20%, then jumps to another stock with the proceeds to ride that stock up the same percentage again and again. They're just trying to make money, and ultimately they have no power over whether or not people buy. The key here is that their trades don't determine price fluctuation one way or another. Can't blame a fish for the way the river flows.

I see numerous DD posts that cause no reaction in the stock price for any number of reasons, or none at all. Most DD posts I see are posted after the stock has already jumped a massive amount, which likely means the person is trying to get more people in so they can sell at a reasonable profit before the dip everybody knows is coming.

I think people forget that this isn't a market so much as a bazaar. People yelling at you from all directions dangling shiny things in the hopes that you'll give them money before you've had the chance to think about it. Learn to navigate it, and you can make serious money.

163,DD," I had mostly mining stocks today. one of them went up 40%. And that was just one. So... there's that.   
One company states that they have a 40% profit margin. They have hundreds of mining machines set up(in one building) and their main overhead is electricity. They mine bitcoin that is worth 60K each. One company stated that they mine 4 coins per day.   
not a full DD, but there was great money to be made on them today. Not all of them though, I saw some of them that had their stock drop. So watch the company you put your money into.

Yesterday I started posting my next weeks' potential runner **$SGSI**.

**SGSI** had 550 watchers on stocktwits and an avg volume of 800k. Yesterday after people saw my DD the watchers grew to 900 during market open and the volume grew to 2.4m, this took the price from 0.35 to 0.66. After the market closed the watchers continued to grow and now has 1300. By Monday I believe there will be a lot more watchers ready to buy which will give the stock the volume it needs to move fast.

**SGSI** is a low float stock which the price increases quickly from a little volume.

Just cause a company churns out news/etc. daily does NOT mean it's a strong buy automatically. Are catalysts valuable? Of course. But don't sell out of impatience... I've already learned that lesson ten-fold since starting trading them part-time a few months back. I'd be a millionaire already if I had told myself this lesson.

Stocktwits is full of confirmation bias and spam with bullish sentiment until stock starts trending downward (profit taking/dumping started) and only then you can see occasional bear bashing thr stock while “bulish” people instead of presenting their argument just scream “HODL”, probably just to drop their heavy bags on you. 

Twitter seems even worse sometimes and full of pumpers. Here is how it works. People with a huge number of followers are spaming the twitter with their picks but not before they and their little merry band of paying followers/subscribers take their positions. Then they start taking profits while dumping their bags on you.

I have to be honest, it’s hard to find someone to trust nowadays and even when you do your own DD and it looks solid.

356,DD," Thank you! I’ve definitely tried to diversify more as of late and it’s helped my portfolio skew towards green on red days. 

I do feel like I’m learning a lot. My initial goal was 10k by the end of the year. I’ve adjusted that and would like to see 10k by June and very optimistically 20k by the end of the year. I know those would still be massive gains but I like to have something to work towards.

I am definitely recognizing that a lot of these sectors get really hot (EV, clean energy, SPACs, biopharm pennies, etc.) and then go through cool off periods. Understanding that cyclical nature has helped me resist FOMOing into things and will help me moving forward. I’ve also learned a lot about offerings and how to play those to make some quick gains. Learning more about how to do some quick DD (insider holding, institutional holdings, PTs, checking out the pipeline, etc.) has helped immensely in terms of not falling for the pump and dumps. 

Going forward, I think biopharm or biomedical will continue to be my niche. I am a PA student and while I don’t know everything about medicine and pharmacology, my background in healthcare gives me the ability to scope out what has potential and what looks kind of sketch.",bluelemoncows,2,/r/pennystocks/comments/lo6pbl/two_months_in_and_up_120_positions_in_comments/go48hjw/,0.015,0.808,0.177,0.9866

361,CE," It's a Caveat Emptor, Dark/Defunct, No Contact stock with a TINY share structure.

https://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/MBAY/security

Things that can cause such movement could include:

1. A massive reverse split. This seems unlikely due to no filing (which I am pretty sure would be required) but it would explain a price jump of that nature and goes along with the small share structure currently showing.

2. When a stock is this dead and dark, there is the potential someone could have bought out all or most of the O/S shares to take full control of the company. They may have had to buy a few shares at 30 cents if folks had them listed for sale at that price.

3. A mistake. Somewhat unlikely but there is the potential someone market bought the stock and with limited quote info, they might have bought shares at a higher price than intended. Effectively accidentally buying some shares at 30 cents driving up the price to that point. And with likely very little volume and liquidity, it just remained there.

4. No volume pump. Someone could have spent very little money to drive up the price on a tiny share structure hoping it would take off and cause a mini pump and they could make a decent chunk of money off it.

5. Fraud. Due to the Caveat Emptor, Dark, and unable to contact nature of the stock, someone could be using it in some sort of scheme or illegal activity. Fraud potentially. Money laundering is another possibility.  This is why SEC wants to crack down some on these types of OTCs and why more and more brokers dont allow trading of CE stocks.

Problem is, with a stock this dark, with no filings, and with limited chart data, there is no way to really know what happened for sure.",Noexit007,23,/r/pennystocks/comments/lo0orh/mbay_300000_gain_on_the_market_overnight_what/go3fj9i/,0.147,0.76,0.094,-0.9694

369,DD," Agree people should be careful at these levels, but many of us have been in for awhile and going long. The reason ASTI has been going up is because they were on the verge of bankruptcy, then Förtsch took over and infused the company with cash and a new partnership with his existing solar company in Germany.

Ascent isn't focused on the commercial/retail space - they make stuff for NASA, the military, etc. If you don't think solar will be heavily utilized in defense/aerospace/agriculture, then you shouldn't invest in this company. There are plenty of companies selling residential solar panels to consider.

374,TD," I bought this stock a month ago without much of the research. I liked that the idea of the thin solar panels plus it seems they did some job for NASA. The more research I did after purchasing the shares the more I start doubting my choice.  I looked their retail product and even if it has  some good reviews, it didn't look that appealing to me. Yes it is good for the backpacking but couldn't see how that can be scale up and apply in other sectors. Even though it seems they are targeting agriculture I still see it as a small niche market.  Someone mentioned they paid their debt but can't find info on it  and my TD research tools still show that  it is one of the most leverage company in the sector. Now imagine being most leveraged company in the the probably most leverage sector... I do not think it is pump and dump but I sold my shares at this point. Keep watching it in hopes they can come up with some wider application for their product. But the company that exist for more than 10 years and still looking for its identity and place on the market doesn't encourage optimism.

390,HEPA," They used to be called [ContraVir](http://ir.contravir.com/news-releases/news-release-details/contravir-pharmaceuticals-announces-name-change-hepion). Have never brought a drug to market. 

With this new drug they have, it’s early. So early. It’s only completed Phase 1. And lots of things can go wrong in clinical trials. Most drugs don’t have successful phase 2, even fewer drugs go on to have successful phase 3.

If everything goes as they project it to, NDA isn’t expected until 2025 or 2026 per their own estimate. So that’s 4 to 5 years of clinical trials until they even file for FDA approval. There also aren’t any other drugs in the pipeline as far as I can tell.

Because of this, I am personally passing on HEPA. I keep seeing threads about it that don’t seem to be presenting an honest take. Sure, it may run in the short term but it’s got a long ways to go and it’s way too risky. If Phase 2 trial doesn’t pan out it will sink the stock and they have nothing else in their pipeline to redeem them.",bluelemoncows,2,/r/pennystocks/comments/locxkz/hepa_dd_biopharm_play/go588sb/,0.025,0.914,0.062,0.6597

395,AI," I love this excerpt from the 2020 Year in Review PR which I think applies to this post:

**Key investment in AI Engineering**

Central to Sonasoft’s success has been its focus on AI engineering. According to Gartner:

“Developing a disciplined AI engineering process is key. AI engineering incorporates elements of DataOps, ModelOps and DevOps, and makes AI a part of the mainstream DevOps process, rather than a set of specialized and isolated projects.”

In Q4 of 2020, Sonasoft hired veteran ML engineers and data scientists. This allowed a focus on taking NuGene from MVP to a fully-fledged product.

The Head of Engineering is Max Lee, who has an extensive background in creating hardware and AI solutions for chatbots, signal processing, and computer vision. He epitomizes the way the whole engineering team works. He is able to solve problems by applying his multi-disciplinary knowledge that spans mathematics, science, engineering, and ethics.

The Head of Data Science is Caroline Zaborowski. She brings years of experience applying data science to solve complex problems in the online gambling industry. Prior to that, she completed a Ph.D. in Astrophysics at the University of Oxford. She ensures Sonasoft applies rigorous standards of data science, which has allowed NuGene’s performance to improve significantly.

REDWOOD CITY, CA / ACCESSWIRE / February 11, 2021 /Biotricity, Inc. (OTCQB:BTCY) (""Biotricity"" or the ""Company""), a medical diagnostic and consumer healthcare technology company, is pleased to provide unaudited, preliminary financial results for its fiscal 2021 third quarter, which ended December 31, 2020. Full financial results will be posted on EDGAR on February 16, 2021. Biotricity's Q3 results continued a trend of both sequential and year over year revenue growth, with revenue setting a new quarterly record in the fiscal third quarter.

For fiscal Q3 2021, management is reporting the following highlights:

Revenue of $1 million (USD) - a milestone for Company in its quarterly results

Year-over-year quarterly revenue increased 162%

Sequential quarter-over-quarter revenue increase 34.5%

""We achieved significant growth during a period of restricted travel due to Covid, so we are even more optimistic about our growth potential as the business environment unlocks,"" stated Waqaas Al-Siddiq, CEO of Biotricity. ""Our sequential quarterly growth really illustrates the importance of our technology and model, where we are enabling a cardiologist while improving patient care. Monthly sequential growth is a sure sign that our platform is on target, and we are on track to continue our strong sequential and year over year growth.""

""During the three months ended December 31, 2020, the Company experienced a gross margin of 49.2% compared to 43.6% in the preceding quarter,"" said Biotricity's CFO, John Ayanoglou. ""This improvement is consistent with our prior forecast that the cost of devices sold and other technology associated fees will become a lower percentage of revenues as sales volumes expand. We had significant product development activity during the quarter, including an FDA filing, so our net loss of $0.11 per share was higher than the net loss of $0.085 cents per share in Q2.""

In the current quarter (fiscal Q4 2021) and for the remainder of calendar 2021, the Company is guiding to continued triple-digit revenue growth on a year over year basis. With added resources from a convertible debt financing completed in January 2021, Biotricity is currently interviewing additional sales personnel as part of a planned geographic expansion into additional states. The Company filed a 510(K) seeking FDA approval for its new Biotres Holter product on December 31, 2020 and expects the review process to run approximately four months.

Dr. Waqaas Al-Siddiq added, ""We are coming out of the gate at a full sprint in 2021, with salesforce expansion and work underway on new products that will enable us to target a much larger segment of the cardiologist patient population. We spent years developing best-in-class technology coupled with a compelling technology as a service model.

435,JAN," I usually invest PINK CURRENT and SAML is my next huge investment. Albeit Fidelity only allows Pink Current to be traded through their platform, I am glad for that rule. Caveat Empire's & Pink with no information can sit around for a bit; up to years and not do a thing. It locks down your money to buy another security. I have seen some stagnant picks take off towards a penny but Pink Current does as well; just wish I could ride all the rockets. 

Pink Current like the previous ones I've flipped (GAXY WDLF GTEH MINE) I bought when they were trip 0's. I got out early and re-investing elsewhere not realizing just waiting could have brought more profit. With the above aforementioned stocks, it seems that there was a pattern of taking off once every 52 weeks. I know companies have to meet certain pricing req's and financial reporting to remain eligible to trade on OTC exchanges let alone labeled current. 

The pattern I've been trying to nail down is when. SAML has reached 52 weeks from last high of 0.0090\~ year to date. I think it needs to return to 1 cent: 1) OTC eligibility 2) Current. There are methods of doing this; the dreaded reverse split, which per SEC filing JAN 06

462,DD," You definitely bought it at a high. I bought in on a dip at .0053 because it seemed like a cool product. But then I did my DD and found it was likely a scam or PD. So I got out at 007 the next day. That same day it had gone to a high of 0081. Which might be your best bet to get out. 

But yeah see how it goes. It's hard to make out the trend with the red market. With people saying that it is a PnD, a penny might be the dump and it does seem to have reached that level super quickly and it hasn't reached it again.

464,CEO," After looking around, it seems the Right On CEO ( part time) supposedly ran his previous Hemp adventure into the ground by reportedly doing shady trading practices.. Company name was Rocky Mountain High and they went to court over share reimbursement when he left. 

There's a few other discussion boards saying this Jerry guy is not very trustworthy as well. 

The brand name and this Endo water seems OK but if ppl don't trust the person at the top of the chain, it's gonna be hard to get ppl to jump in. 

Still...the stock is so cheap. I guess ppl can buy a large chunk of shares and hope that this ticker goes from Scam to Legit in the future..",CadderlySoaring,2,/r/pennystocks/comments/lo4i3h/rton_seems_like_it_has_great_short_and_long_term/go4qnx1/,0.092,0.789,0.118,0.1217
465,DD," It’s an undervalued company. Simple as that. The versatility of its products alone speaks for it. TOBAF at $4.31 a share and $RTON only $0.006.
