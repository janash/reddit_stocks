0,SMM," Love to see some lower marker cap tickers here- feel like this entire sub is missing out on big gainers by only focusing on massive tickers with much lower ROI. SMM Monopoly has a great track record- every other custodianship they've got granted is sitting at 25m-75m+ market cap before a merger is even announced while $cafs sits at 3m. Easy 10 bagger to start if granted and all signs are looking good.

36,TRCH," I do not see a summary of these catalysts, so I wanted to explain it as best I can. Here is an ELI20. If you could upvote this so it can get more awareness, that would be great. 

So, a merger between Torchlight (TRCH) and Metamaterials (MMATF) is expected by June 18th, this week. At that time all shares of TRCH will convert to MMeta shares, as that will be the new company’s ticker. This happens on a 1:1 scale, as in 1 TRCH = 1 MMeta share. For each of these TRCH shares, you will be issued 1 “preferred” share. This preferred share is not a company stock, but more like a bookmark for future dividend. Once the land is sold off, that profit will be kicked back to shareholders through this preferred share in a 1 time dividend. This dividend has been speculated anywhere from $1-$20. Most folks agree it’s more closely between $5-$10.   
  
The ex dividend date has yet to be announced. This is the date by which you must own shares to qualify to receive the preferred share. The ex dividend date cannot be retroactive, as in it must come at the announcement of the date, or after, but not before. So you’re still in the clear for now. Once the ex dividend date is announced, the company has until the end of the year to sell the land and issue the dividend. You *do not* need to hold the MMETA shares after the merger to retain the preferred share/dividend.   
  
In addition to all of this, you have the other company in this merger, Metamaterials. If you own shares of this company, you will get 3.7 (I think) shares of MMETA for every 1 share of MMATF you own. This is great if you plan to long hold, which a great many people do. Truly a great company.

78,SPRT," # 4. Value Play

## Great Balance Sheet
Even without the merger, $SPRT is valuable. They have net tangible assets of about $41m. To put it simply: $SPRT could close up shop and distribute all remaining assets to their shareholders, who would get about $1.70 per share. That is basically the absolute minimum that the stock should be worth. I think that the company is worth much more as the management team has demonstrated that they could turn the company around. I must admit that they are doing business in a tough sector, but the management team and the Board of Directors have been doing a great job so far. Other companies that are burning cash and reporting losses year after year can are often valued at multiple billion dollars. I think SPRT's share price is depressed because the company's management team was focused on more important things than ""window dressing"" in the past couple of years.

## Undervalued compared to Competition
With the merger, $SPRT can be even more valuable. If one simply assumes that the new company that will emerge from the combination of $SPRT and $GREE should be at least as valuable as the Bitcoin miner $RIOT, which currently has a market cap of $3bn, then the theoretical value of $SPRT should be roughly $9.24. The calculation is as follows: $3bn (assumed value of new company) * 7.7% (share of $SPRT shareholders in new company) / 25m (assumed number of shares outstanding at the time of merger) = $9.24 per share.

Some people have argued that the merged company should not be as valuable as $RIOT. One can, however, also argue that the merged company should be more valuable than $RIOT. The main argument for the first case is that $RIOT is currently mining more Bitcoin than $GREE. My point is: That doesn't have to stay like that. $GREE is operating their own power plant, their cost for mining Bitcoin is presumably much lower than their competitor's. As of March 25, 2021, $RIOT employed 8 full-time employees. $SPRT alone had 780. Adding the employees of $GREE, adding the power plant, adding the highly capable management team, adding the backing of institutional investors that are behind both, $GREE and $SPRT... I mean, it's hard to put a figure on it, but I don't think it's asinine to think that the company that will come out of the merger between $SPRT and $GREE should be valued higher than $RIOT.

## Insider Ownership
An additional indicator for the value of $SPRT is the high insider ownership, which is at [over 37%](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SPRT/key-statistics?p=SPRT). Rick Bloom, the former CEO, the man which that group of investors hired back in 2016 and who turned the company around, who is now a Director of the company, owns more than 1.3m shares of $SPRT. Bradley Radoff, another Director, who was part of the group of investors that took over in 2016, owns more than 1.7m shares. Lance Rosenzweig, who was appointed the new CEO in 2020 (by the former CEO and board of directors) has options on 1m shares in $SPRT if he does his job right and stays with the company. None of them have sold a single share in the last twelve months. Sometimes I see someone calling $SPRT a pump-and-dump scheme. But looking at these numbers, noone of the insiders is dumping. They also didn't pump in the past, so I am not exactly sure what those people mean. I admit that $SPRT has been very volatile since the merger announcement, but that is not due to the insiders selling their shares. They are holding on.

Better yet: Bradley Radoff (member of the Board of Directors, owner of 1.7m shares in $SPRT, part of the group that took over $SPRT in 2016 and turned it around), he has been running a hedge fund called ""Fondren Management LP"" for a while. You might be interested to know that large institutional investors have to report their long positions to the SEC on a regular basis. Those reports are called 13Fs. A large institutional investor in the US has to report their long positions every quarter. The thing is, Fondren did not report their positions in the last quarter. My assumption for that is that the fund itself did not do great. If you look at the past 13F reports by Fondren, their assets have been continuously going down. They have been liquidating positions. In the last 13F report, their holdings totaled [$17m](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1328331/000092189520002932/xslForm13F_X01/primary_doc.xml). If you asked me, their fund was not doing very well and they had to liquidate their positions. They are not longer reporting their positions, because generally speaking, smaller investors are not required to do that. Since they are only having $17m in long positions, I think they do not fall into SEC's reporting requirement any longer and therefore, they don't have to report their positions any more.

If you look at their previous reports, however, one thing stands out: they have been basically liquidating almost every one of their positions. Every single one - but $SPRT. At the end of 2019, they held 1.3m shares in $SPRT, and their total holdings equaled $97m. In Q3 of 2020, their last report, their [total holdings equaled only $17m](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1328331/000092189520002932/xslForm13F_X01/primary_doc.xml). However, their position in $SPRT was unchanged: [1.3m shares](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1328331/000092189520002932/xslForm13F_X01/infotable.xml). So there is an insider that has been involved with $SPRT for the past five years. He owns a very large position in $SPRT. He has been liquidating almost every single position of his. Every single one - but $SPRT. To me this yells that this insider has a very high conviction about $SPRT and they will not sell at the current prices. He didn't even sell when $SPRT's stock price was above $9.00 in March of this year.

And it's not just one insider that shows a high conviction in $SPRT. Mr Bloom, the former CEO, now Director, owns more than 1.3m shares of $SPRT. The one thing that I like about this best, that the largest bulk of these shares were not ""gifted"" to Mr. Bloom, as it often happens in companies that give their CEO huge stock packages and dilute the other investors. No: Mr. Bloom [took more than $1.4m](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1104855/000165495419013931/xslF345X03/section16.xml) of his own hard earned money at the end of 2019 and bought more then 700k of $SPRT in the open market. He has [hardly sold a single share](https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/own-disp?action=getissuer&CIK=0001104855) since.",BeGoodToTheTime,9,/r/pennystocks/comments/nzju1k/supportcom_sprt_upcoming_merger_and_other_good/h1pvxtx/,0.033,0.845,0.122,0.9984

104,TRCH," I posted this on the Torchlight thread, but feel that more people might want to see this as well. 

  
  
So, a merger between Torchlight (TRCH) and Metamaterials (MMATF) is expected by June 18th, this week. At that time all shares of TRCH will convert to MMeta shares, as that will be the new company’s ticker. This happens on a 1:1 scale, as in 1 TRCH = 1 MMeta share. For each of these TRCH shares, you will be issued 1 “preferred” share. This preferred share is not a company stock, but more like a bookmark for future dividend. Once the land is sold off, that profit will be kicked back to shareholders through this preferred share in a 1 time dividend. This dividend has been speculated anywhere from $1-$20. Most folks agree it’s more closely between $5-$10.  
  
The ex dividend date has yet to be announced. This is the date by which you must own shares to qualify to receive the preferred share. The ex dividend date cannot be retroactive, as in it must come at the announcement of the date, or after, but not before. So you’re still in the clear for now. Once the ex dividend date is announced, the company has until the end of the year to sell the land and issue the dividend. You do not need to hold the MMETA shares after the merger to retain the preferred share/dividend.  
  
In addition to all of this, you have the other company in this merger, Metamaterials. If you own shares of this company, you will get 3.7 (I think) shares of MMETA for every 1 share of MMATF you own. This is great if you plan to long hold, which a great many people do. Truly a great company.
