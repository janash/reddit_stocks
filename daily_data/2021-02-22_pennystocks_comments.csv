86,DD," I’m starting a group here where we evaluate stocks $1 and under, and people do quality DD and post to group, and members are encouraged to buy at least 100 shares of a stock that the DD is done on.(you pick whichever you’re comfortable with) Hoping each member will contribute DD to at least one stock every quarter. (We will keep track and those who do not may risk losing their membership.) 

You can invest in as many stocks as you want or buy however many shares you want. Also each month members will vote on a particular charity to give back a portion or “pay it forward “ if there are any realized gains. Not mandatory but encouraged. 

I’ll choose 4 moderators based on involvement and participation for a total of 5 of is who will monitor the club, and vote on any important issues like kicking out a member for being disrespectful or not doing DD once a quarter, or any other changes we collectively agree on. Once we hit 100 members we will make the club private, and additional members will be welcome but only thru invites of other members in good standing. 

Just an idea i had a few days ago and discussed with someone else so I’m hoping to find a bunch of people to make it a success. And who knows maybe even have a yearly conference if people want to attend. 

The group’s title is Stock100.
I’m relatively new to Reddit and to trading but in the last few months I’ve been doing really well and figure this group could also help newbies who are just getting started. 

And honestly we can make changes on the fly but to collectively come up with some defined rules for the club would be great. I want it to be a place where there is no p&d allowed, where people respect each other, actually do some work to contribute, and also have fun, give some back to charity, and hopefully benefit financially! The only posts to the club will be the quality DD posts, and anything else we can have live discussions. I don’t want it to become a meme post or distractions from our goals so we’ll keep it simple. I also want to make sure we stick to code of conduct as to remain ethical in every way. 

Anyways I’m hoping to find a bunch of people so feel free to join if you’d like!

That's more than 3 times more than Pfizer, a company with multiple huge market products. That's simply not reasonable this early in a company's lifespan, and won't be reasonable until Citius has products that address more widespread concerns. 

New medications generally have a decent adoption rate because they generally need to establish that they offer some benefit over existing treatments to receive any sort of developmental interest from a company and investors. Your example regarding SSRI's is not based in reality. 

I'm sure Mino-Lok will make CTXR a phenomenal amount of money, but one product is simply not enough to take a new pharma company with no existing marketed products to 100 dollars.

140,USA," Your educated guess is good. Let me explain the backstory of what Mino-lok is supposed to do:     

[Central Venous Catheters](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557798/) is an invasive method that we need to use from time to time in emergent situations (think of fluid resuscitation), when multiple infusions are required, or to initiate therapies such as hemodialysis, or used in venous interventions... A catheter is placed in such a way that the catheter goes through the skin, into the vein. You may be wondering why I'm pointing out the obvious? Well, your skin AND the catheter can potentially **contain bacteria**, that potentially gets placed into the vein during the insertion of the catheter.       

I couldn't find the most recent numbers of how often CVC's are used, but [this source](https://m.canadianinsider.com/citius-moves-forward-with-mino-lok-phase-3-trial) mentions that in in the US, 7 million CVC's get placed annually, of which 500'000 turn into life-threatening situations.       

Of these life-threatening situations, we know for a fact that the [bacterial disease in question](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4093967/) is THE most frequent AND the most lethal complication of placing a central venous catheter. Cited from the second pubmed article:    

>Central venous catheters (CVCs) pose a greater risk of device-related infections than any other types of medical device and are major causes of morbidity and mortality.       

> Meta-analytical study done at The Johns Hopkins University showed that bloodstream infections (BSIs) were the third leading cause of hospital-acquired infections. These infections have an attributable mortality rate of 12% to 25%.[6] Individuals counteract 250,000 BSIs each year in the U.S., 60% of CRBSIs were caused by micro-organisms from the patient's skin. CRBSIs often originate in emergency rooms and intensive-care units, where 5.3 bloodstream infections occur per thousand days of central venous catheter insertion.  

We're basically looking at an intervention that *already* gets used commonly, *despite* of the lethal risks. It might look easy on paper to work in a perfectly sterile environment, but it's clearly not.    

> Annually, approximately 2 million patients suffer with healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) in the USA, and nearly 90,000 are estimated to die. The overall direct cost of HAIs to hospitals ranges from US$28 billion to 45 billion. Source: [Economic burden of healthcare-associated infections: an American perspective](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2827870/#:~:text=Annually%2C%20approximately%202%20million%20patients,%2428%20billion%20to%2045%20billion.)  

> Infection type	| Annual infections (n) |	Mean hospital cost per infection (US$) | Mean deaths per year | Annual costs    
> ---|---|---|---|---    
> Central-line-associated bloodstream infections: |	248,678	| 36,441	| 30,655 | 9,062,074,998   


The point of Mino-lok won't be to give it to everyone with a CRBSI. The idea will be to administer a Mino-lok to everyone* who is eligible to receive a central venous catheter, to prevent bacterial infections in the first place. After all, that's why Mino-lok is also called an antibiotic lock. 

Mino-lok in the medical world is a form of ""prophylactic treatment"". The major advantage of Mino-lok compared to simply administering an antibiotic systemically (giving an antibiotic to the patient's blood directly), *should* be that it works against increasing the population's antibiotic resistance. Antibiotic resistance is an immensely large problem in the world, and being able to target the problem more efficiently means that we'll be able to keep using our current supply of antibiotics for quite a while longer. It also means that the patient experiences far less side effects from Mino-lok, compared to systemic antibiotic use.

147,IPA," Honestly I'm new at investment so I can't comment with any real authority about price targets. But I've been an ICU nurse for 11 years, so I can talk about hospitals and CLABSIs!

I work in a pretty big metropolitan hospital and even there, adopting new technologies and products is a long, arduous process that isn't always in line with current best evidence. A lot of the caps that we've used are either an antibiotic, or more commonly a mix of CHG and/or IPA since they're cheaper and have less reaction than antibiotics. A lot of smaller hospitals can't or won't justify the expense. Most patients I get from outside hospitals don't have any kind of caps on their lines.

I think a lot of this company's prospects are based on their phase 3 trials and how they price their product. If hospitals can get a similar product for less, they'll give this a pass. If it shows amazing results and is priced competitively, then yeah, this thing could skyrocket. 

like I said, until phase three trials come out I can't really say whether or not it's a good product, though it does have promise. I'm just nervous about the huge amount of hype that I've seen on this subreddit going into it.

* ZOM (Holding) - Sticking with them til their product release on March 30th
* PULM (doubling down) - Biopharm (which I tend to avoid) that's doing surprisingly well and has been listed with a PT of $10 by several analysts, which seems bonkers. I don't think I'll stay long enough to see it through, but I'm bullish for a bit.

$AITX - their CEO Steve is very active on Twitter and often has PR to help.boost the stock. It took a hit last week. Should seeing bounce back. After a red week last week. Wanted to add to the dip last week but put it into CCIV instead.

$OZSC - Another beat down last week but they have tonnes of products with lots of utilities in the EV world. I'm long on them as well, curious to see how they rally today.

$MINE - My fav play of the day. I'll be taking profits from SENS(it's up 400% I'm just shaving a bit) adding money to MINE. It dropped down to $0.01 after last week's mini media storm - they had a webinar yesterday setting the record clean and squashed any unconfidence I had. 

$CTRX - I took a tiny $100 position regretting not going in harder. Waiting for some funds to move over from my TFSA. Hoping I can get it under $2.50 by the time that happens but im not hopeful. Just going to be happy I have skin in the game there!

531,DD," Minus the speculation on SP movement post-court outcome, there are additional catalysts coming up. 

Off the top of my head, S-1 filing is around the corner (sometime this or next week), meaning ATVK can uplist to OTCQB. They’ve also already confirmed they’re in the process of acquiring a company with multi-million dollar revenues, and another a few months later. There’s a bunch of DD available out there with further info & catalysts. But an uplisting, result of the court-case win and an acquisition taking place all so closely to each other does point towards a bullish sentiment. 

Because ATVK’s court case has been dragged out from January through to late Feb/March, a lot of holders relying on this outcome for a boost in SP have gotten impatient and there’s been a huge sell-off, hence the downward trend. But it was silly to think the toxic lenders would just bend over and take the loss, of course court proceedings would be dragged out as much as possible. The recent delisting (can only sell, cannot buy) from a UK broker (T212) also led to a further sell off. 

Personally, I don’t think this is a P&D, but it’s also naive to think it can shoot to $1 in a short span of time as it’s being spouted in multiple forums, .3-.5c seems more realistic.

Reason

I was doing DD... Meandering through articles about a company and the board members involved.

**********😱😠 LAYERING 😠😱***********

(In layering, a trader places orders with no intention of having them executed. Rather, the SEC said, the intention is “to trick others into buying or selling a stock at an artificial price driven by the orders, which the trader later cancels.”)

I like ASRT, but I'm not 100% sold on it. I sell the $1 put, which I can sell right now for $15. If the price of ASRT falls below $1, the option gets assigned and I am contractually obligated to buy 100 shares of ASRT at $1, no matter what the actual price is. So, as long as ASRT stays above $.85, I make a profit, and if the price is between $.85 and $1, I'm essentially buying ASRT at a discount. 

The hazard with this play is a sudden crash in price, which I doubt would happen. What really gives me pause (and the reason I haven't made the trade already) is earnings March 11, a week before option expiration. This year has proven exceptionally screwy for earnings reports (e.g. STMP dropped ~20% after beating estimates by 50%).",belangrijke_muis,3,/r/pennystocks/comments/lpezuc/the_lounge_thoughts_noob_stuff_low_effort_brokers/gocr772/,0.112,0.802,0.086,-0.7153

704,EV," I   understand your point of "" If we’re going to burn fossil fuels to make   electricity, let’s not use that electricity to make hydrogen "" but  there  is a lot to be said on that area.

You have two parts to address:

1. Energy:   In terms of energy consumption and talking purely on means of  transport  both electrical and hydrogen are the future. How important  and good  both electrical and hydrogen technologies are is not worth  arguing. Who  says otherwise needs to research and learn;
2. The government approach to these types of energy are the main issue and what needs more attention

If   a government pushes for an E.V; market but doesn't change their energy   sources its like cleaning your house by moving the dust under the rug:   its useless and your just fooling yourself. The first results might be   amazing, cities with cleaner air but the the coal plants 100km away  from  the cities are creating a lot more pollution. So, in reality, you  are  purely moving your pollution and probably even creating more

The   solutions have to be planned. Investing in electric and hydrogen cars   is not only about providing incentives and forbiding combustion cars:   its also about changing and reforming the countries energy industry.   This is were big changes have to be made.

Now,   I'm Portuguese and I can ensure you that an EV car here is much  cleaner  compared to many other countries because our energy is mostly  based on  hydropower and windpower.

Now: Electric vs. Hydrogen whats better?

Well,   in a sense everything indicates that both will co-exist and will be   needed for different purposes. My prediction is that Electric will be   the next pretol (city driving and small distances cars), Hydrogen will   be diesel (long trips since batteries are prepared for more milage, plus   it can be used in trucks and cargo ships) and finally, efuel. Efuel   will be used in high-end cars such as Ferraris, Porsches, and overall   sports cars.

There is one big   reason why Hydrogen is better than Electric: batteries. The same way   countries are pushing for EV and not changing their energy sources, many   countries will not be able to afford, nor be interested in actually   creating high end disposal batteries facilities. And this will be a huge   problem!

In  terms of energy  spent, as long as you are using green energy, who cares  if you are  using a lot of it for a lower amount of hydrogen? For now,  what is  important is that is clean green energy and an effort is being  made.  Later, we will worry about harvesting the highest potential and   reducing waste. For now, lets at least be greener.

Finally   a last point: Planes. What I'm about to say might sound crazy but   planes are bound to end. Planes are needded for intercontinental trips   and longer continental trips but to make 200km or 500km planes need to   end. And again, this sounds crazy considering we are in the boom of the   industry (or we were, before COVID) were tourism was cheap and  available  to everyone. But that is so sooooooo bad. And with time  people will  understand that planes need to be limited and trains using  electric  energy (from clean sources) will be the future.

TL;DR:   Hydrogen is clearly the future along with EV for every means of   transport. The first step is to harvest green energy and next to   optimize that harvest.",jpmonteiro_pt,3,/r/pennystocks/comments/lplzic/honest_criticism_about_hydrogen_as_fuel/gocdjrj/,0.061,0.775,0.165,0.9962

Production, storage, usage. You literally need magical technology in all three areas to make it work. Otherwise it’s a net waste versus electric, and that’s not even counting the precious metals.

779,DSWL," Definitely. DSWL doesn't have much visibility/PR and seems to be quite secretive so volume usually only picks up around dividend dates but it does mean that it is a very stable stock and less liable to pump and dumps.

Additionally, institutional ownership is high with 65% of shares being owned by executives - and this proportion has been increasing throughout 2020. Additionally there have been no sell-offs despite the recent and sustained price increases. The management team has been with the company for an average of 21 years and they're very bullish on future prospects. This is likely to be a longer holding but with a high dividend yield (5-7%) I'm more than okay with that.

Generally the UK and Canadian penny stocks are excellent value compared to US pennies just now. A lot of US pennies have already jumped. Some on nothing more than speculation and J.pow fumes. 

The U.K. market in particular does not suffer quite the same hedonistic swings as the US market.

800,TRCH," I was discussing this elsewhere on here, and someone mentioned that the $35M is lower than current value (\~$50M?) and that this is the value of the land itself, not the oil.  So the oil should be more.  I don't know how to value it properly myself, but with 147K acres of land, if they sell for only $1K/acre (no idea what is normal for oil fields), that's still over $1/share for the dividend.

And as others here have mentioned, I think the merger means that TRCH shares own 25% of META, but 1 share equals 1 share.  You can call it dilution, but it isn't the same as getting 0.25 shares at the same price.  The price will remain the same, just more shares outstanding.

801,TRCH," Understood, and good to be diligent and careful.  

My personal belief is that the dilution would be an issue if the price for TRCH was stable based on fundamentals, but it is not.  Thus, while shares will be ""diluted,"" it isn't going to decrease the price or hurt current shareholders because the belief is that the new META company will have a lot of growth and the value will continue to increase.

If TRCH goes up to where META will eventually stabilize, then the dilution concern is valid.  But I think we're still buying META at a discount, especially now with TRCH below $4.",PsycheRevived,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/lpeytd/help_with_trch_dd_and_outlook/gocbe0b/,0.061,0.814,0.125,0.6562
802,TRCH," My understanding is that those shares won't ""hit the market,"" they will be given to the current shareholders of META.

So there's TRCH listed on NASDAQ, and META listed OTC (MMATF), and both have shareholders. When the merger happens, the MMATF owners get 3/4 of the total shares for the META(new), the TRCH shareholders keep their shares.

The TRCH shareholders get a bonus dividend whenever the oil and gas assets are liquidated.

I just read an article on seeking alpha that tried to go from the current TRCH backwards, reaching the conclusion that TRCH shares are grossly overvalued because they're only 1/4 of MMATF market cap. However, I don't think I you can compare the market cap of MMATF to the market cap of the merged META. I could be wrong, but this merger and investor interest is creating a new market cap that is disconnected from the current price of either company.

But if you're leery of TRCH, buy MMATF instead (or avoid the investment). Never want to talk someone into investing if they have concerns.",PsycheRevived,2,/r/pennystocks/comments/lpeytd/help_with_trch_dd_and_outlook/god9wba/,0.042,0.859,0.099,0.8209

804,DD," What are your goals? YOLO? Day trading? Swing trading? Going long like my wife does with her BF?

All these will play a factor, Keep in mind if you are day trading on cash and not using a margin account you must follow T+2 and allow your cash to settle before you trade it out again. So keep that in mind while you are deciding what quantity of each stock you want to trade. also ask yourself if you want to trade everyday or if you want to trade only a few days a week and let some stocks ride overnight or for a few more days. 

Don't forget to do your DD and don't blindly follow others into the dark, it may work sometimes, but the times it doesn't work is when its going to hurt the worst.
