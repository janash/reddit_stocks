Hedge funds and short sellers might target a particular stock for a variety of reasons. However anyone can be a short seller if they have access to a broker who will allow them to. 

In the case of gamestop, there was more sold shares than liquid shares (float)

What happened because of this is some particular hedge funds (my bet citadel) decided to engineer the options chain to increase bank pressure to the upside (a more complex topic) which caused a “short squeeze”, which is when those who are sold now have to BUY shares to close their short positions to stop losing money. This is essentially a feedback loop, and with WSB piling in to increase buy side pressure, Citadel running the chain to force sell side (banks/ market makers) to increase buying pressure again, and every short having to close positions they dont have, we are where we are now.",0.06,0.826,0.114,0.8495
