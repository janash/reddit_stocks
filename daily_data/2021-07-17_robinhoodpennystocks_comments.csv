1,NEPT, I bought back into NEPT today. I was in at 1.60 before. And cut my losses as it slowly faded. But with todays massive dump. And hopefully good growth ahead. It Seemed a perfect price to get back in for a small play,pointme2_profits,3,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/ols2xw/penny_stock_unusual_options_volume_716/h5h0rbv/,0.12,0.546,0.334,0.9343

4,AGTC," No worries, I'm at my computer working on options stuff anyways.

AGTC - most active July & Aug $2.5c. ATM calls are usually the most active. Nothing looks out of the ordinary, some decent volume on Jan 2022 calls (>200 total)

ALNA - doesn't have options

CHMA - 28 total in options volume. July $2.50 call (12), July $5p (3), Jan 2022 $5c (10), Jan 2022 $5p (3). Looks like a put calendar spread. Sell the July $5p to reduce the cost basis of the Jan 2022 $5p.",Itsboomhomie,2,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/ols2xw/penny_stock_unusual_options_volume_716/h5jqqtc/,0.055,0.853,0.093,0.5402

7,DD, I think I am gonna try and find some time to scour through DD posted several months ago to see if I can find anything with catalysts lining up to roughly now. A lot of DD does seem to be legit. It just seems to take several more months for it to actually pan out.,OKJMaster44,5,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/olt9mb/daily_discussion_thread/h5ifupi/,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
