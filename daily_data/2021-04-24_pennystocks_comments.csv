What’s made this run is not anything really remarkable about what they manufacture. We all know this not renewable energy. What’s made this run are a good share structure and all the new filings leading up to WTII becoming fully PINK current.

APHA is not an american cannabis company and it's a pipe dream for the excessive amount of retail followers pumping it on reddit. HITI is another canadian company, retail that is and has a small online presence in the us with a recent aquasition but they do not grow produce or sell weed in the US.

Now for real US Cannabis companies 

Curaleaf
Green Thumb Industries
Cresco Labs
Trulieve
Verano 

All of the above companies are MSO's or multi state operators producing and selling Cannabis. Curaleaf is projected to gross over 1 billion next year.

Columbia Care
Harvest Health and Rec
Parralel
Planet 13 (only 1 location Vegas but opening more)
Acreage 
Vireo Health

I don't know if it is fair to compare Canada and Cali yet as Canada's weed market is very young. 

But I believe beverages will become a more normalized way of consuming THC/CBD and MLCL is a craft cannabis canning company about to ship their first order to OCS (ontario cannabis store) on the 30th with drinks arriving early may.

They help companies who want to get into craft cannabis beverages come up with brands/recipes and they can them. They already are committed to ship to OCS and the Quebec cannabis store with plans to try and expand west.

I'll never purchase from them again.

Trulieve and Cresco Lab's 'One Plant' (formerly, Bluma Wellness 'One Plant') have great products. They are always packed, with minutes left in the day. I want to give these two my money for their products. Trulieve is like the big box store while One Plant caters to the connoisseur.

31,MC," Medivolve is first and foremost an investment company. They invest in profitable growth markets. They have identified the telediagnostics market as a market that will grow from 61bn in 2019 to 600bn in 2027. Theyre setting the cubes up as telediagnostics sites where remote patient monitoring can be done, with testing equipment, without the need of a full docters office.

We are expecting the first diagnostics to come to the cubes in the coming week or 2. If and when this model works and is profitable, they will roll this out over all the existing cubes, 60ish right now.

There are contracts in place for 740+ locations. Once the telediagnostics market is penetrated, medivolve can easily switch to a franchise model to induce rapid growth over those 740+ locations.

Personally i see them setting the business up similar to how MC Donalds has set them selfes up. With the pillars being, Convenient, Affordable and Everywhere.

33,JNJ," Many factors in play, but the risk to reward here imo, is insanely good.

If we were to assume the executed well with their diagnostics, sales of  Nuturell's Surface *Shield* technology , roll out of JNJ vaccinations , that alone would suggest a extremely bright future for this company. Then they have their noninvasive covid test waiting for clinical results, which will be a game changer in covid testing. 

This whole covid thing is a short term thing to really fatten their books and it will likely continue to be a stream of income, as covid will likely be an endemic, and who knows, maybe covid spikes will be coming soon, leading to more testing and revenue.

&#x200B;

Moving beyond covid they are essentially building a presence that allows them to acquire patients all at a very low cost, since there is a lot of government funding involved, leading to high margins.  They will eventually pivot into tele diagnostics, which I believe is a very strong model for telehealth  as it provides a standardized form of telemedicine for people at a more convenient location. They have digital peripherals that can measure vitals, blood sugar, a digital scope that can assess the ears nose and mouth.  This also addresses the rural population that lacks specialists. Moreover, it addresses many factors that current telemedicine lacks, as it is currently only a patient speaking to a doctor through a computer, so the doctor is extremely limited in his/her ability to actually diagnose, since they can only rely on symptoms and maybe visually seeing the patient off a really bad camera.  We should also consider the patient's that are not tech savvy as well, so going to a nearby cubical site with an assistant and a set of standardized diagnostic equipment sounds very ideal to me.

If all of this is executed, then we can be seeing a marketcap above of at least above 250m  probably more. I honestly don't know how I'd set a target that far off, but it will be very high from where we are now and I believe 250m is gross underestimate. . Considering how scalable their mobile sites are and how many underserved rural people they are, I believe the marketshare they can capture from the community centers alone is fantastic. According to this website 57 m Americans live in rural areas, Perhaps when they get into small cap territory, or midcap, one of the bigger companies may just buy them out.

54,XXII," I more or less looked up every weed stock symbol that I could find and bought chunks of them all. That’s how I ended up with this one. I have a friend that does very well blindly buying 10 pennystocks at one time (like 500 into each one), out of the ten he found that roughly 7 are worthless or don’t move, 1-2 do something but nothing spectacular, but there is usually that one breakout that “goes to the moon”. Pretty much how I ended up with XXII lol",ciscophreak,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/mxjgap/worth_checking_out_xxii/gvpgdoe/,0.021,0.849,0.13,0.8704
55,OBSV," This is a completely baseless claim and you deserve to be downvoted for it. It takes one quick Google search to find it isn't remotely true with the information we have right now.

""There is currently no evidence that any vaccines, including COVID-19 vaccines, cause fertility problems. \[...\] Like all vaccines, scientists are studying COVID-19 vaccines carefully for side effects now and will report findings as they become available.""

56,TA, Depends on your strategy. I use multiple for context but my TA methods always start with the smallest possible swings and expand out as those become less useful.

57,NBA," I also think $ZKIN will have a profitable upcoming week. They've already gone +10% after their announcement of a NFT platform.   
And now with Mark Cuban betting big on NFTs, we can only expect things to blow up for ZKIN's NFTs backed by NBA players.",JimmieBain,2,/r/pennystocks/comments/mxcii9/earnings_season_has_really_kicked_off_i_have/gvpf4v0/,0.0,0.909,0.091,0.4588
