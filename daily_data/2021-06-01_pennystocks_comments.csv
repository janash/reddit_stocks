26,IP," The already have a licence agreement with Valkor (the engineering company, that was heavily involved in the pilot plants constrution, optimization and certification). Subject of the licence is to build mult-site plants and the use of IP as well as the right to call every new IP, thats developed at new sites on top to be PetroTeqs. (source: [https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/03/12/1999941/0/en/PETROTEQ-ANNOUNCES-PROGRESS-ON-NEW-TECHNOLOGY-LICENSES-AND-CHANGES-TO-MANAGEMENT-AND-BOARD-OF-DIRECTORS.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/03/12/1999941/0/en/PETROTEQ-ANNOUNCES-PROGRESS-ON-NEW-TECHNOLOGY-LICENSES-AND-CHANGES-TO-MANAGEMENT-AND-BOARD-OF-DIRECTORS.html))

Valkor has acquired (leased) lands at around 17,000 acres, which is nearly the same size of what TomCo Energy already has leased in the Uintah Basin. TomCo was involved in the pilot plant es well, as the tested soils from other potential sites for how well they can be processed. (source: foreword financial report: [https://www.tomcoenergy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Tomco-2020-Final.pdf](https://www.tomcoenergy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Tomco-2020-Final.pdf)) This was the reason for the cessation order([https://polaris.brighterir.com/public/tomco/news/rns/story/ryzln7w](https://polaris.brighterir.com/public/tomco/news/rns/story/ryzln7w) ), which shutdown operations. The test was succesful and the operations issue was resolved - just a new notice of interest needs to be filed by PetroTeq.

Valkor and TomCo have a 50/50 JV called Greenfield and by the JV contract will start building a 10000bopd plant as soon as commerciality is proven and financing secured. They already put a lot of money into it as seen in the financial report and other documents. Together they have nearly 35,000 acres of land, that can be used for processing. A multi-site licence in the JV and are already know the tech.

PetroTeq will get 2mio $ for each site + 5% of the net revenue from the operations of each site. Since the sites are scalable/modular, operations can be increased ""easily"". The licence mentioned is non-exclusive and currently only for the US. There are many more sites...so there is even more possible gain in the near future, than the current pilot plant.",StoryPenguin,12,/r/pennystocks/comments/nppkaf/pqeff_current_sp_01329_the_buyout_offer_sp_059/h06b8xb/,0.0,0.9,0.1,0.9755

31,IMO," I'm one of the few people who actually bothered to watch the AAF and XFL, which is why I'm commenting.  They were not great products to watch, and not many people knew of the AAF and only heard about the XFL 2.0 because of the media wanting to talk about the sequel to McMahon's league.

The talent pool isn't really how you describe either.  Yes, there are lots of college players who didn't make the pros, but they're also not good.  The quality of product is important and watching minor league football is a lot different than something like baseball - with that, the pitchers are still throwing strikes on the regular, hitters are hitting homeruns; to a layman it looks like the same game as the MLB.

But the AAF and XFL were clearly a bunch of people with less talent playing the game, similar to college, where QBs make bad throws routinely and there isn't the same type of explosion/athleticism - except there isn't the engrained loyalty/atmosphere of college programs to rely on.

All this is to say:  take the gains from initial fervor and leave it at that, this isn't something to believe in long-term IMO.",Will_Dearborn57,4,/r/pennystocks/comments/nptltr/why_you_should_be_a_fan_of_mlfb_updated/h07t9op/,0.074,0.814,0.112,0.8114

33,BEST," ""The conclusion of the ""Demonstration Season"" will remain July 2021.""

How do you reconcile that though? That's from the press release recently. This would mean at BEST 3 weeks of 1 game each. Start of July 11th. That gives 5 weeks of showcasing players, uniforms, logos, and coaching staff. Tickets haven't gone on sale. Their website doesn't have a schedule, and is still using a video from May 2020. Movies that have that short of a turn around with lack of promotional materials, generally flop. I'm not here to argue the ""realness"" of whether this is happening or not, just don't think any amount of ""info"" is going to make the stock go up without updates to all that I mentioned above. Especially since we've been told it'll start, at most, 5 weeks from now. It's going to crash late July, if not sooner, and as soon as that stuff is all up to date and actual promotional material is released, it'll stagnate around 3-4c at best. So, I suggest people steer clear of this stock until the crash happens and buy in then, if there is evidence a season will be happening. Just being told it's happening isn't going to carry a stock, you need evidence with the things I mentioned.

70,AI," Recent IPO for Alfi (ALF) Providing AI Assisted Brand Building and a Marketing SaaS Platform for the Internet and Out of Home Applications  
   
The technology to help brands grow will always be in-demand. This tiny float, newly NASDAQ listed stock could be our next runner.  
   
Good day everyone,  
   
We are initiating coverage of Alfi, Inc. (NASDAQ: $ALF), a provider of interactive intelligent artificial intelligence and machine learning software solutions.  
   
Current price                   $2.83/share  
Outstanding (est.)           12.36M shares  
Float (est.)                       3.83M shares  
   
ALF closed on its IPO and began trading on the NASDAQ May 4, 2021. The IPO consisted of 3,731,344 common shares and warrants. The common shares were sold at $4.15 each and the warrants are exercisable at $4.57 each for up to five years.  
   
ALF shares are trading at a 49% discount from the IPO price. While it‚Äôs not unusual for IPO shares to contract after the event, there usually comes an inflection point where the shares begin to gain. We believe ALF shares have reached that point and with a tiny float, these shares could move quickly.  
   
The scope of the AI driven Alfi SaaS product is awe inspiring and may have you saying, ‚Äúwhat the heck? I didn‚Äôt even know that was possible.‚Äù  
   
Alfi is developing an AI enterprise SaaS platform powering computer vision with machine learning models, and deep learning to deliver the right content, to the right person at the right time. When a consumer interacts with an ALFI Tablet, Kiosk, or internet content, the software begins a sophisticated AI assisted data capture. The digital device then displays content/advertising relevant to its analysis of the viewer.  
   
The company has provided a brief overview video of the firm's SaaS platform. This video may be a critical part of your due diligence.  
   
Digital advertising isn‚Äôt new, but Digital out of Home (DOOH) advertising, utilizing AI to generate and report data from consumer interactions is still in its infancy. This niche in advertising is where ALF lives right now.  
   
The market for tracking and reporting on DOOH advertising activity is expected to grow at a double-digit CAGR through 2023. Imagine getting into a taxi or a ride share vehicle and there‚Äôs an interactive pad on the back of the headrest or going to a mall and interacting with kiosk. This kind of technology will become ubiquitous in the near term, and ALF is one of the leaders and innovators in the sector.  
   
The overall market for digital advertising is $614 billion.  
   
Alf is already reporting positive results in more than 12 separate pilot programs deploying over 1,000 devices and expects to start generating revenues in Q2 and be profitable by Q421. The company plans to have tablets installed in 100,000 ride share vehicles within 4-5 years.  
   
These are the applications ALF wants to deploy both to brands and to businesses to generate revenues:  
   
Airports and Malls ‚Äì Kiosks  
Taxis and Rideshares ‚Äì Tablets  
Enterprise Software ‚Äì SaaS  
Data Analytics ‚Äì Subscriptions  
   
Alfi plans to woo ride share drivers and taxis and others with participation in the revenues generated by placing a tablet in their vehicles or locations.  
   
Understanding the sophistication of the Alfi software may best be understood by their disclaimer statements:  
   
ALF is compliant with all GDPR, CCPA, and HIPAA standards. Alfi‚Äôs proprietary Ai algorithm understands small facial cues and perceptual details. The automation works in a way that respects user privacy; without tracking, storing cookies, or using identifiable personal information. The company states it will not store facial images.  
   
We look at ALF as a rare opportunity to get involved in a new IPO with the technology of the future, a future that is starting right now. There may be the potential for a triple digit increase in value here.

82,TD, There are multiple tiers in the OTC market as penny stocks trade anywhere from sub-penny to $5. Sounds to me like you are trying to buy something listed in the Pink Sheets which are least regulated therefore I believe most brokers will charge a fee in order to purchase. I'm not sure if different brokers reduce or eliminate fees as you buy penny stocks in higher tiers but it is the same $6.95 per trade on TD Ameritrade regardless of the tier.,EggEmbarrassed1338,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/npklqf/the_loungedaily_plays_june_01_2021/h07d97h/,0.018,0.96,0.022,0.0693
83,TD," Schwab or Fidelity don't charge fees for OTC stock trades. E-Trade and TD Ameritrade do.


I'm on E-Trade, too. I opened a Schwab account, thinking I would switch because of the fee, but the customer service and the app are so much better at E-Trade. I use my Schwab account when I want just $10 or $20 of a stock, but mostly I stick with E-Trade. After 30 transactions in a quarter, your fee goes down to $4.95.

One really big plus of E-Trade is that there's no extra fee for foreign stocks. TD Ameritrade charges $15, and Schwab and Fidelity charge $50. That's when you buy AND when you sell.",NothingReallyAndYou,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/npklqf/the_loungedaily_plays_june_01_2021/h07jv6z/,0.049,0.899,0.052,0.0689

Fortress restructured Dynex Capital NYSE $DX with NOVC Chairman of the Board Barry Igdaloff. Add in Igdaloff cabal mostly DX investors they own 40M shares and my small count hold & do not trade 30M =120M shrs. More shares of NOVC are held then outstanding per NOVC 2020 10K filed at SEC 3/4/21. Where are NOVC trading shrs coming from otcshortreport.com ? Someone has bought 100Ms of $NOVC shares since Igdaloff, Chairman and his ex-DX investors Fortress, Wesley R. Edens, COB took control of NOVC Board https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/08/09/1900133/0/en/novation-companies-inc-executes-first-amendment-to-senior-secured-note-purchase-agreement.html I ask Mr. Market who would buy one NOVC common shares on no news, a false narrative that leads to 10K GAAP ""Going Concern""? By concealing their plans, they rent GAAP into Going Concern. Answer is someone with the true narrative is buying.   
This is not investment advice. Do your own Due Diligence and share!   
  
BTW $NOVC holds $730M NOLs & Rights that control collateral assets on most $3B portfolio (rich 600 Bpts Weighted Average Coupons & seasoned). These attributes can copy Fortress' and Chairman restructuring at DX and Fortress restructuring at Newcastle NCT which changed its name to Drive Shack $DS after separating 4 tax exempt MREITs SNR, GCI and $NRZ. Read $NRZ 2020 10K NRZ www.newresi.com shareholders paid Fortress $170M lucrative two-part management fees plus tens of millions in $NRZ common dividends. $DS kept $160M NOLs and is gravy for Fortress and their cabal of co investors (parent SoftBank $SFTBY, Leon Cooperman, Blackrock, etc).   
NOVC can spinoff 100% owned ex MREIT Novastar Financial Inc. and use rights per Service Rights Transfer Agreement Sec 5.04 (attached to back of 2007 Q3) rights called Cleanup Call Rights CCR aka called 2nd Bite of Apple per these Quants. CCR are well known to MREIT experts like Manny Friedman, Neal Wilson Co-CEOs of EJF Capital and Wesley R. Edens, Peter Briger, Co-CEOs of Fortress 100% owned by Masa Son CEO of SoftBank and ex Fortress executive Rajeev Misra, CEO of SoftBank www.visionfund.com & ex Dynex Capital DX Board Members Barry Igdaloff Chairman of NOVC and Thomas Akin ex DX Chairman of the Board and CEO. Akin with his HF Talkot Capital are the largest shareholders in $NOVC, $DX and $IMH. NOVC still owns 100% of www.healthcare-staffing.com HCS which is gravy that will operate tax free with $730M NOLs after NOVC trigger back collateral assets it controls on most $3B RMBS NonQM portfolio. These collateral assets can be leveraged and resecuritized (like NRZ and DX uses 15:1 so 3B x 15 times= $45B portfolio x NIM 500 Bpts = $2,300,000,000 NIMs net interest margins less some SGA (probably pay Fortress another lucrative management fee like the $170M annually paid by NRZ Shareholders) less some other operating expenses and Note Holders collect est $170M annually dividends (31.3M shr X $5.50/estimated annual dividend). If Mr. Market prices NFI like NRZ dividend off 10% yield Note Holders Fortress and EJF make $55/shr x $1.7 Billion on their virtually zero cash invested in CDOs Service Rights that hold all of NOVC only LT Debt to exit Ch 11 with 6.3M cash with no cram down. Fortress bought these CDO Service Rights same year their co investors from $DX Barry Igdaloff (per DX 8K 9/3/20 Igdaloff restructured DX with Fortress and served on DX Board for 20 years and Howard Amster joined NOVC Board) https://www.inquirer.com/philly/business/homepage/20100422\_RAIT\_sells\_Taberna\_CDOs\_for\_\_16\_5M.html   
NOVC shareholders still have HCS tax free $730M NOLs gravy like $DS was to Fortress after separating 3 tax exempt MREITs. Drive Shacks web site outlines DS restructuring by Fortress Dec 2016. NOVC Board conceals these plans which rents GAAP into Going Concern drives share price to pennies.

111,SP," Yes doesn't look great.  Now that being said the good news is Wandi deal is still on table.  The 60 million shares are still recorded for the Wandi deal.  

The revenue for q4 is 4 million.  So the total revenue of for covid disaster 2020 was 14 million.  Current market cap is 9 million.  So still undervalued in a P/S sense.  Not happy about the financials, but considering it is an Oil/ gas play in China one would expect complete destruction when looking at 2020 results.  Now with China recovered and last 2 quarters showing each over 4 million revenue I think it is safe to assume 2021 will produce better numbers then 2020 did. 

This is a high risk play, but then again a shot at 10x+ doesn't come easy.  I can't see PRCX not doing better in 2021 then 2020 with or without Wandi and the other acq. on the table which means SP should only be better at some point in 2021.
