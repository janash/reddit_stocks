8,DD," What your missing is that DeepFuckingValue wasn't some amateur investor. He was a Registered Rep with Mass Mutual (quit 1/21/2021 and technically part of the firm till 1/28/2021 and still holds a Series 7(General securities license, need to trade stock), 66 (Can give investment advice on Stocks), 24 (ability to supervise others at a brokerage for trading etc.).

As a Registered Rep at  MassMutal he has to disclose any outside brokerage accounts already owned prior to employment, this is where it gets interesting,  if he wants to open a new brokerage account outside of his employers as it relates to securities he has to put it in writing and obtain approval. If approved at any time when asked by the employer he has to  provide statements and transactions in said outside brokerage account (this is to protect retail investors, prevent insider trading, trading against his firm etc.). What we don't know is did he open the account after employment and second did he have approval. If not he violated FINRA Regulations 3110. The other issue he faces is the Youtube videos and posting here as he has to disclose that as well and obtain permission, my guess if they knew about his Youtube videos they would have shut him down. How do I know this I used to have a Series 7 & 66 and make these disclosures.

Go to the FINRA site and do a Broker Check it is free and his background will show up, it is a FINRA requirement that the public can view a Brokers license history, employment, and any violations freely.

36,GME," Ballsy of you to post that. Mostly agree in that there is no system of accountability for those at the top, and that eventually people feel it necessary to take it into their own hands. Also important to distinguish the rally at the Capitol from those who broke in, who represented less than 1% of people there.

This GME saga has opened a lot of people’s eyes to problems that the “fringe” has seen for years now: that the fundamental incentive structure of government and people who occupy the establishment are corrupt in that they seek reward at the expense of the little guy, invariably without any consequence whatsoever. Politicians, judges, media personalities can all be bought and used to drive agendas, which in almost all instances go against the interests of the people. Fake News is a real thing, as you all have seen now. The Deep State is a real thing, others just call it the establishment, or institutions. 

How else do they expect a frustrated populace to react when they’ve been on the short end of every piece of policy and legislation meant to line the pockets of the establishment, and when almost every channel of recourse has been taken away? You can’t trust social or traditional media, you can’t trust Big Tech, can’t trust Big Finance, can’t even trust Big Law. You cannot trust Big anything because it implies a centralization of power that will ultimately be corrupted, as we have seen time and time again, which is the whole idea behind Power to the People, federated systems etc.

And now they're seeing RH customers landing in hordes like Marielitos because RH did the only thing it could do to save them.

97,ON," Robinhood was downloaded 600,000 last Friday alone according the article below. I am estimating likely a total of 5 million new RH brokerage accounts were created in the last two weeks. The average account has a balance of between $1,000 to $5,000… I’m just going to pick the middle ground and say $3,000. That means over the last two weeks there is about $15 BILLION of buying power from this bunch.

Since Robinhood likely represents about 25% of the brokerage market, maybe another 15 million additional accounts have been opened across all the various Brokerage service providers. Possibly representing another $45 BILLION of buying power.

**In total we are looking at $60 BILLION in new buying power, while the market cap of GameStop is sitting at a relatively cheap $3.7 Billion, at the share price of only $53.**

That means all the new investors could easily **take GameStop to above $900 price per share** with that buying power. But only if everyone can **FOCUS ON GAMESTOP ONLY**.

The Shorts that didn’t cover, or new shorts that came in the game recently would be forced to push the price much higher to exit. Some **shorts may have to cover at prices well above $1,000+ per share** to get out under such a scenario.

106,VERY," So, there are a lot of comments that say people are selling, but are they legit? Is morale actually bad, or are we just supposed to think that? Volume is very low compared to the days where we saw huge price hikes, but I think if people were actually panic selling, there would be more volume and more volatility haults as it dropped. Today's decline was VERY neat and orderly. Almost... mechanical? 

For what it's worth, everyone that I actually know in the trade is still holding. (With a bit of intelligent profit taking on the run-up to cover initial outlay)

At close on Thursday, there was only ~1 million shares available to short, which means the open short interest is still insanely high! S3 boss admitted on Twitter that they changed the formula when they announced that short interest had dropped. The number of shorts really stayed about the same, they just started including all of the share IOUs created from shorting in the float count, so the % got cut about in half.

To me, it looks like it's in exactly the same situation as January 21. With such low liquidity, it won't take much of a catalyst to get things moving back up again. If it was an attractive speculation play then, it's still an attractive speculation play now too. And the lower the price goes, the more the risk/reward ratio tips in favor of additional investors jumping in.",hyperian24,13,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcyewd/mark_cuban_said_once_the_brokerage_stops/gm32ydu/,0.073,0.725,0.203,0.9892

163,GME," Love this. I joined WSB during the March crash, plunged my live savings into airline stocks and saw my wealth increase by 60% in a week.

I then promptly lost all my gains and more when they stablised, netting a 5-figure loss (huge for a guy with a net worth of less than zero, thanks to student debt). I posted my loss porn and started trading options.

I then saw even bigger gains with GME, then again saw 5-figure losses cause I didn't sell.

Seeing your net worth decline by double-digit percentages for days and days running sucks. But posting loss porn and being called a retard is cathartic.


I'm still up 40% from my initial investment in March thanks to ~~carefully selecting my plays~~ dumb luck and a historic bull market, and I'm here to stay.

167,AMC," I put it all on AMC. It's lookin bad now, but I only invested what I can handle losing. I'll be fine even if it all goes up in smoke, just really bummed. I don't expect to make a ton of money on my investment, I'd just be happy to make some. If I don't, that's ok. It was a bet, and losing is part of the game. I'm still glad I'm putting skin in this crazy game and watching the roller coaster. I very well may lose, but you can't win if you don't play, and I'm enjoying the ride no matter what.

I won't sell low though. If it plummets, I'll hold until it bounces back up to a reasonable price. Doesn't matter if it takes years. I won't sell at a loss. I'm playing the long game. That's both a better use of my money and more enjoyable to me than getting scared after 2 days and selling at a loss. Since I can take the hit, the red doesn't scare me.

Go on record with your full name, number of shares and the country you‘re based in. Tell them you have reason to believe that an emergency shareholder vote has to be called, in order to save the company from bankruptcy. Calling the vote means calling shares back to their owners, eliminating all synthetic stock, and hence taking leverage away from fraudulent shortsellers.

Subject: Fears of potential securities fraud

Hello,

My name is \_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_ and I currently own \_\_\_\_ shares of Gamestop stocks. I have reason to believe that the brokerage firms and clearinghouses I've used to make trades have created synthetic stock positions with no ability to actually follow through with them. In order to make sure that these groups are not counterfeiting your company's stock, I request that we hold an emergency shareholder vote. This is necessary in order to shield the company from bankruptcy and minimize potential exposure to massive security fraud. Due to recent events and suspicious trading activity, I would like to also propose a reverse stock split to ensure the legal amount of shares have been issued.

Thank you for your time,

Power to the players,

I then went to WSB to see what to do, and there was so much threads of saying GME will reach $500 or $1000. So I guess I got more bold at bought 10 more shares on Friday (1/29) at $380 a piece. So another $3,800 invested. I was ""sold"" that the ""squeeze was yet to come.

297,DD," That's what pisses me off, the thesis was generally correct and everything pointed in that direction...until Wall Street just said ""nah bruh"". No one could have anticipated we'd get the rug pulled out like that. 

I'm going to use soccer as an analogy, if a player get's injured, they halt the game. They don't just go ""oh your side is down a player? Ha, fuck you, GOALLLL"". So why is it that the stock market can cutoff the ""long team"" due to ""capital requirements"" while simultaneously allowing the ""short team"" to keep playing?

Seems like the ethical thing to do here would have been for the NYSE to halt trading until the brokerages and their clearing houses were properly capitalized, then let the game play on.

Of course this is pie in the sky thinking, to imagine that we'd be in a fair fight in which we all play by the same set of rules.

That said, this has not been a total loss. Think of the knowledge we all now posses? Think of how many dirty tricks Wall Street had to publicly show? There is NO reason why we can't begin to ask our law makers these questions. There is no reason we can't demand actions be taken to level the field.

We also now know that we have to strategize in anticipation of these games. We all have to have multiple brokers. We have to decentralize communication, we have to use misdirection to counter their web crawlers trawling for information, and so on. We have to develop tactics that allow for us to counter theirs, and we have to do it legally. Difficult? Yes. Impossible? No

312,GME," Yeah only $3k per year worth of short term investments, so GME unless you hold for over a year. Writing off 3k doesn’t mean the government magically gives you $3k cash.

The $3k basically goes lowers your taxable income for the year, if you made $40k per year with a $3k write off only $37k is taxed. 

You can only write off $3k per year, so if you lost $30k it’ll take you 10 years to write off your short term capital losses. 

You can use it to your advantage too for losing long term investments, towards the end of the year sell ‘em and buy them back a month later - you can now write off those losses. The tax feds won’t let you write it off if you sell and buy back the same stock within 30 days though, so worth noting.

You can sell your losing stocks and buy different stocks immediately and have that count towards your write off.

Long term losses work differently but yes you can’t write those off. So for anyone reading this, short term capital losses doesn’t mean you get $3k handed to you, but it still does help.

322,GME," It’s all over the place because it’s incorrect. I’d wager over 100% though. I have an idea that the hedges bought up these 2/5 low and high OTM puts/calls that weren’t going to print in order to acquire naked shares from a market maker to dilute the float for washing out for manipulation. Hence, coordinated ladder attack over 3-4 trading days with broker restrictions that eased up just now.

This is the officially dedicated investor relations number of GameStop. Any GME shareholders can call this and an answering machine will take your call. Go on record with your full name, number of shares and the country you‘re based in. Tell them you have reason to believe that an emergency shareholder vote has to be called, in order to save the company from bankruptcy. Calling the vote means calling shares back to their owners, eliminating all synthetic stock, and hence taking leverage away from fraudulent short sellers.

EDIT:

They also have an email in case you can't call [investorrelations@gamestop.com](mailto:investorrelations@gamestop.com)

Subject: Fears of potential securities fraud

Hello,

My name is \_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_ and I currently own \_\_\_\_ shares of Gamestop stocks. I have reason to believe that the brokerage firms and clearinghouses I've used to make trades have created synthetic stock positions with no ability to actually follow through with them. In order to make sure that these groups are not counterfeiting your company's stock, I request that we hold an emergency shareholder vote. This is necessary in order to shield the company from bankruptcy and minimize potential exposure to massive security fraud. Due to recent events and suspicious trading activity, I would like to also propose a reverse stock split to ensure the legal amount of shares have been issued.

Thank you for your time,",CareyMRocks,33,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ld6whz/side_by_side_until_the_end/gm4ut5m/,0.078,0.752,0.171,0.9749

402,AMC," Last week I decided I wanted in on the action.  I was ready to spend up to $500 on a single share of GME.  I've never owned individual stocks before, only Index funds in my IRA.  Obviously I don't want to gamble with money earmarked for retirement, so last week I opened a brokerage account with Vanguard since my Roth IRA is already there.  I transferred in $500, but I didn't realize Vanguard has a seven day waiting period before I'd be able to actually buy stocks.

Today I'm the proud owner of 2x GME had for $63.50 each, and also decided that AMC seems like a good long term investment so I picked up 50 shares for $7.10 each.  I may keep the GME forever as it has a special place in my heart (I worked at a Funcoland in the late 90s, and Barnes and Noble bought Babbages, Software ETC, and merged them into Babbages ETC.  They then later bought Funcoland's 200ish stores, and a small company named Gamestop that only had a handful of locations, but had a great brand name and an online presence which was still rare back in 1999/early 2000.  They rolled everything together, changed all of the names to Gamestop and the rest is history.  Of coarse they later scooped up EB Games and several other regional chains to add to their empire.  Also at some point B&N spun them off as their own separate entity (a the time to probably mitigate the decline of B&M bookstores as Walden Books and Boarders went belly up.  Over the years I worked seasonally at two different GameStop locations, mostly for the nostalgia as well as the employee discount.  The last time I worked there was around or shortly after the PS3 launch as well as the Wii launch.  I was even robbed at gunpoint at one of the South Philly locations on my 3rd day working at that store!

Regardless, I believe in GME and the need for physical retail locations.  While these days I usually shop at a more local chain that also carries board games and sells a lot of MTG and other CCG stuff as well.  But I know that there are a lot of areas where GameStop is the only option for dedicated video game retail sales.

I also like AMC, and while I see the movie theater business shrinking due to trends like streaming;  I also think that there will always be a market for the movie screening experience in some capacity.  I also believe that theaters will see a huge resurgence after Covid is under control and people just want to go out and do the things that they couldn't for so long.  

Obviously I'm just an ape and this is absolutely not financial advice.  These are just my opinions and gut feelings and I'm a knuckle dragging mouth breather so don't listen to me, do your own research!  I'm also playing with money that I'm 100% sure I'll lose and I don't mind as it's not going to break me.

420,GME," Look team... If we think it is reasonable that GME will pivot to online gaming and streaming and be the ""Netflix of gaming"" then it's reasonable to do a quick calc of value based upon Netflix.

Facts: 

Netflix: $242 billion market cap
GME shares outstanding: 69.7 million

For conservative estimate, let's say the total market GME can capture is half that of Netflix. I say conservative because Amazon is getting into this space. Valve is private so we can't compare to them. 

$121,000,000,000/69,700,000 shares=$1,736/SHARE

Subject: Fears of potential securities fraud

Hello,

My name is \_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_ and I currently own \_\_\_\_ shares of Gamestop stocks. I have reason to believe that the brokerage firms and clearinghouses I've used to make trades have created synthetic stock positions with no ability to actually follow through with them. In order to make sure that these groups are not counterfeiting your company's stock, I request that we hold an emergency shareholder vote. This is necessary in order to shield the company from bankruptcy and minimize potential exposure to massive security fraud. Due to recent events and suspicious trading activity, I would like to also propose a reverse stock split to ensure the legal amount of shares have been issued.

Thank you for your time,

Power to the players,

This is the officially dedicated investor relations number of GameStop. Any GME shareholders can call this and an answering machine will take your call. Go on record with your full name, number of shares and the country you‘re based in. Tell them you have reason to believe that an emergency shareholder vote has to be called, in order to save the company from bankruptcy. Calling the vote means calling shares back to their owners, eliminating all synthetic stock, and hence taking leverage away from fraudulent shortsellers.

EDIT:

They also have an email in case you can't call investorrelations@gamestop.com

Subject: Fears of potential securities fraud

Hello,

My name is _____ _____ and I currently own ____ shares of Gamestop stocks. I have reason to believe that the brokerage firms and clearinghouses I've used to make trades have created synthetic stock positions with no ability to actually follow through with them. In order to make sure that these groups are not counterfeiting your company's stock, I request that we hold an emergency shareholder vote. This is necessary in order to shield the company from bankruptcy and minimize potential exposure to massive security fraud. Due to recent events and suspicious trading activity, I would like to also propose a reverse stock split to ensure the legal amount of shares have been issued.

Thank you for your time,

605,AMC," As long as you don’t need the money in the short term AMC honestly seems like a pretty safe long term bet with some potential to shoot up in the short term. It was at $16 in 2019, even if there is no squeeze it would make sense for it to rise back up “naturally” as the vaccine rolls out and theaters can open back up in full. If you are fine with the possibility of having to sit on it for a while you will likely see some form of profit, it may end up taking a couple years though.

As always, do your own research, but I can’t imagine AMC sits below $10 over the next 2 years unless they really mismanage getting back into the market in a post COVID world.",Scientia_et_Fidem,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ld9pot/which_of_you_retards_made_me_almost_crash_to_get/gm5doll/,0.025,0.893,0.083,0.705

I bought 11 share at about $10 and I figured I would just hold until vaccinations are finishing up and everyone rushes back to see the 45th marvel movie on a big screen.

This is the officially dedicated investor relations number of GameStop. Any GME shareholders can call this and an answering machine will take your call. Go on record with your full name, number of shares and the country you‘re based in. Tell them you have reason to believe that an emergency shareholder vote has to be called, in order to save the company from bankruptcy. Calling the vote means calling shares back to their owners, eliminating all synthetic stock, and hence taking leverage away from fraudulent shortsellers.

Subject: Fears of potential securities fraud

Hello,

My name is _____ _____ and I currently own ____ shares of Gamestop stocks. I have reason to believe that the brokerage firms and clearinghouses I've used to make trades have created synthetic stock positions with no ability to actually follow through with them. In order to make sure that these groups are not counterfeiting your company's stock, I request that we hold an emergency shareholder vote. This is necessary in order to shield the company from bankruptcy and minimize potential exposure to massive security fraud. Due to recent events and suspicious trading activity, I would like to also propose a reverse stock split to ensure the legal amount of shares have been issued.

Thank you for your time,

They might have a better shot at somehow combining this idea with a Twitch takeover. I know LoL is not everyone's cup of tea, but there's no denying that if GME could cause Riot to swap to them as their primary streaming platform, that they'd take off.

They'd have to find some niche we'd care about between all the game hubs you can buy through already, the streaming platforms we have already, and the hardware we have already.

I'm a dad of 5. I grew up on gaming. I shopped at Gamestop. I don't have time to build PC's anymore, or keep up with console wars (and getting pissed when they die).

668,GME," They shorted 120%+ of the stock.

They must cover that by buying back and returning every share they borrowed.

When was that 120% shorted and at what prices? The original shorts happened when the stock was in the $5-$20 range. Has the price of GME been at or below that since then? No. Has the volume been enough such that even if they were 20% of the total daily volume they could have covered the amount they needed without losing 10's of billions at those prices? No.

If they shorted more at the recent highs, they now not only have to buy back every single one of those original shares, but every single one of the newly shorted ones.

Buying raises the price. After the massive interest they've been paying, they only win if they can buy every single share they owe at even lower prices than they originally shorted at just to break even.

Remember that it is a zero-sum game. In a vacuum of a theoretically efficient market, if they short 1M shares and then buy back 1M shares, they will make no money. The prices they sold for will balance out the prices they buy back for.

The only way they win is if they instill lasting panic and fear and suppress prices so they can slowly buy back the entire company (nearly twice over now) at artificially low prices. If they have to buy back at $60, $100, $200+ they LOSE. If they can keep the price down below $40 (ideally sub $20 and as low as possible) they can claw back shares by taking advantage of paperhands and retards who get bored because they didn't make $10M in one day.

All people have to do is hold and wait them out. Be patient and disciplined. If you cut your losses and sell low, you're just transferring money into their pockets and letting them get away with it. They have to buy every share eventually and time is not on their side.",onezerozeroone,11,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ld62bq/mark_cuban_on_cnbc_on_friday_were_going_to_see_a/gm4z7co/,0.101,0.788,0.112,0.4994

I know you are going to hate to hear this, but the lower it goes, the more powerful WSB can be stepping up to buy the stock again. The only question is what broker do you use .

This isn't true. 100% of the float being shorted doesn't mean everyone needs to sell.

If one stock existed total, and got borrowed from A and sold to B, you'd have one short, one share, two owners, and 100% SI.

707,GME," It is fairly obvious that WSB as a whole could easily own the entire float and cause massive FTDs to pile up in the system as well. It is just a matter of settling into the siege and slowly turning up the pressure. 

 

If one was to do a quick calculation of the number of users of WSB multiplied by 10, then one would realize that WSB could own the float of GME.

With the borrow rates being as high as they are currently, it would cause quite a bit of pain to the hedge funds to keep those positions on their books.

If one was to do the above WSB users x 10 calculation and then add 1 share to their portfolio each month, one would then realize that hedge funds would be short almost 4x the float.

I also think that Fidelity and Vanguard both have enhanced yield programs that allow long stock holders to collect 50% of the borrow rate.

If one was to do another calculation, then one would realize that WSB user x $100.00 is a very large number. 

Then if one was to take the above large number and multiply by 12 then one would realize that that number is even bigger.

This would cause HFs to be extremely short the stock and cause massive portfolio drag, because as the ticker gets shorter and shorter the borrow rate increases.

Somebody has to hold this short position on their books and they will slowly get eaten up by interest rates and that will lower quarterly performance of HFs and quarterly bonuses of workers at HFs.

Assuming that WSB users just put $100 into GME every month, then WSB could create a scenario where the HFs are short high multiples of the float while paying interest.

Somebody has to hold that interest rate bag, causing a decrease in quarterly performance and the lowering of bonuses.

The above scenarios assumes we do not have any paper portnoys in the crowd.

Subject: Fears of potential securities fraud

Hello,

My name is _____ _____ and I currently own ____ shares of Gamestop stocks. I have reason to believe that the brokerage firms and clearinghouses I've used to make trades have created synthetic stock positions with no ability to actually follow through with them. In order to make sure that these groups are not counterfeiting your company's stock, I request that we hold an emergency shareholder vote. This is necessary in order to shield the company from bankruptcy and minimize potential exposure to massive security fraud. Due to recent events and suspicious trading activity, I would like to also propose a reverse stock split to ensure the legal amount of shares have been issued.

Thank you for your time,

809,BB," I honestly feel like BB is way too undervalued.  BB has an awesome direction, and they are pretty strong into network security, while also working OS systems for vehicle.  If you want to take the network security side, look at Fortinet, valued at 150$ a share..  and there some articles that think fortinet is undervalued as well.    But just that difference alone between the two share prices should peel back some layers on the undervalue that BB is experiencing.  

If you take the vehicle side, what bb is doing with AWS is pretty much the same thing that Ford is doing with google.. the difference being that BB is working with multiple car manufactures rather than just a single manufacture teaming up with a cloud service provider.

Plus, BB had a pretty stellar earnings statement this last go around, showing the company is solid.. talk about evolving a company with the times.",RepulsiveAstronaut68,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ld1rqt/i_heard_i_can_post_this_here_for_some_free_karma/gm4y3kv/,0.012,0.777,0.211,0.9846

Plus they have deals with Amazon for QNX, bought Cylance(?) to add cyber security to their existing vehicle OS.  An OS isn’t cheap to make, so licensing from someone like BB who has no skin in the game as opposed to say Tesla or another automaker with an Licensable OS makes sense to me.

Unlikely to make a big profit or anything but if the company does a decent job navigating a post COVID vaccine world then even if OP bought in at $15 they have a decent shot of at least getting most of the money back. AMC hit $16 in April 2019, not totally unlikely it will rise back up again sometime in the next year or 2 as the vaccine rolls out and you aren’t risking killing grandpa when you go to the theater.

Honestly I’m thinking of buying into AMC now as a long play that has some potential to skyrocket in the short term. I just can’t imagine it not hitting at least $10 as COVID restrictions are lifted.

Second, I plan to stand firm and HOLD until we break through their lines! I currently see their lines slowly crumbling on the ticker right now. It's slow and we (people still in the stock) are moving them back one bloody step at a time.

Third, If we get a good report on Tuesday and can break through the line, I think we will see those tendies coming our way by EOD next Friday. That will (IMO) be the moment that the rocket takes off. I hope everyone is all aboard for that ride to some yummy moon tendies!

-------------------------------------------------------

I would like to bring to your attention some irregularities concerning the recent GME situation. In order to do so I would like to first provide you with a brief primer on how market manipulation works, then give examples of such suspected manipulation that I believe it is important for you to investigate in the upcoming hearing concerning GME.

First it is important to understand what a wash trades and matched trades are. The following link from the SEC describes them on slide #25

https://www.sec.gov/files/Market%20Manipulations%20and%20Case%20Studies.pdf

Such wash sales and matched orders have in the past been used to manipulate both market volume and price. This practice goes back many years and continues today. The following link is another SEC document describing a situation where the market volume and resulting price were manipulated at above 70% of total volume for a year and a half. Please draw your attention to Page 12 paragraph 1 of this document.

https://www.sec.gov/litigation/aljdec/id78grl.txt

“Finally, comparing the total volume of wash trades and matched orders reported with the total volume reported only on those days on which reported wash trades and matched orders occurred, from January 1, 1989 to June 30, 1990, Broumas's trades constituted 73.7% of the reported market volume for JML Class A stock.  From July 1, 1989 to December 31, 1989, the applicable percentage is 72.4%.  From July 1, 1989 to June 30, 1990, the percentage was 73.7%”

However, this document is very old. I present this document to demonstrate that not only is this not a new technique but that in the past such things have been done at high volumes for extended periods of time. As a consequence here is an SEC publication as recent as September 28,2020 which involved the use of wash trades from June 2017 to March 2018

https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2020/lr24920.htm

“According to the SEC's complaint, from at least June 2017 to March 2018, individuals and groups who held large quantities of microcap stocks paid Zinkwich hundreds of thousands of dollars to facilitate a scheme to drive up demand for the stocks of certain issuers.”

Now that we have established how a market can be manipulated both in large volumes and for extended periods of time. I would like to draw your attention to a YouTube video of Jim Cramer, host of CNBC’s Mad Money and former hedge fund manager, describing the hedge fund playbook when they are in a short position.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMuEis3byY4

In this video, Jim Cramer describes how to manipulate the stock price down and describes a strategy in which Hedge Funds “create an uplift, followed by a slow fade” to produce “a real negative feeling” in order to “beleaguer the moron longs”. If you look at the current situation, one might call this an accurate description of what is happening. However, this is not proof of any wrong doing of course. Just an interesting observation. However, Jim Cramer also says that it is also very important to get CNBC on your side. And here we do have some proof of manipulation. I would like to draw your attention to a post by CNBC made Feb 2, 2021 at 9:19AM, just before markets open. The same day that price dropped from over $200 to under $100.

https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/02/as-gamestop-plunges-volkswagens-2008-short-squeeze-gives-an-idea-of-how-painful-it-will-get.html

The problem with this report authored by Yun Li, is that the graph that they present for the Volkswagen 2008 squeeze has been manipulated. Please refer to the image upload in which CNBC’s graph is overlayed with real historical financial data using the same timeframe.

https://imgur.com/a/PETRTdZ#zvRYOfj

Here you can see that the market data is clearly manipulated on the CNBC graph in order to downplay the volatility prior to the 2008 VW squeeze. Obviously, the situation between 2008 and today is very different. As a result, you shouldn’t be comparing the two situations at all. But I am not here to make an argument comparing the two together. All I am showing here is that CNBC presented manipulated data and that’s a simple fact. Now of course if you look at CNBC’s graph, they source it FactSet implying that they didn’t make the graph themselves. However, this is a syndicated news outlet with professional reporters supposedly knowledgeable in their field, and anyone with a few minutes to spare can look up the historical financial data. Do you really believe that the reporter that wrote this or the editors that reviewed it didn’t know that this graph was manipulated?

Let’s assume that you don’t believe that CNBC made an honest mistake. Let’s assume that you don’t believe that Jim Cramer’s description of the hedge funds playbook similarities with the current situation a coincidence. Then I would have to believe that at this point you might be beginning to wonder yourself if there is more going on here.

Which is why I urge you to call on the SEC to testify on this matter. The SEC has announced that they would be watching this situation very carefully. So I believe that in the interest of public trust it is very important to have the SEC testify as to what they are actually doing to protect the public interest. What records have they subpoenaed? What are they actually doing to investigate the matter? One example of something they could, and definitely should, be doing right now is subpoenaing the transaction record to look for matched pairs and wash sales and other irregularities suggesting market manipulation.

For example, take a look at this following image of 4 different stocks real time trade information as posted by Nasdaq.com at the close of Feb. 2, 2021.

https://imgur.com/gallery/rncscA9

If you can guess which one is GME, I think that says a lot. Again, this is not proof of any wrong doing. All financial transactions during regular hours are bundled and presented in the way that Stock C is shown. This is done intentionally to obscure individual transactions. However the SEC can investigate these trades in a way that an individual cannot. Considering all that has happened, I believe it is paramount to the public trust that the SEC be called to testify to determine whether or not they are actually investigating these obscured transactions appropriately.

Not to mention calling CNBC to answer for their publication of manipulated data on the morning before a sudden market decline that so closely matches Jim Cramer’s description of what we should expect.

Please, I implore you as a concerned citizen. Do not let these questions go unanswered. Why did CNBC publish manipulated data, and what has the SEC actually done to secure the public interest while watching this GME situation unfold.

Sincerely,

A Concerned Citizen",debugg_and_bait,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ld5rd9/evidence_pointing_to_shorts_did_not_cover/gm5n3cy/,0.061,0.871,0.068,0.7162

858,GME," Someone has brought up this document before and honestly, after reading, it isn’t bullish for a squeeze. Rather, the opposite. This tactic allows them to constantly push out the clock (seemingly indefinitely) because they are able to just re-up shorts and push out their failure to deliver dates. 

-Hedge Fund 1 (who is over short) sells deep ITM calls to Hedge Fund 2.-

-Hedge Fund 2 sells shares to Hedge Fund 1.-

This makes it seem like HF1 is buying to cover positions. However...

-Hedge Fund 2 exercises calls immediately.-

-Hedge Fund 1 was supposed to be buying shares from Hedge Fund 2, but now owes shares right back because of the exercised options.-

These two actions negate each other, no shares are actually exchanged, and clocks are now reset on contracts/deliveries. This deal is setup beforehand between the two funds for a fee. It appears like HF1 has complied with share covering, however, they just perpetuated their position and resetting the clock. There is no limit on how many times they can do this. It’s for as long as they are willing to pay a fee, which is likely cheaper than unwinding the trade and mooning GME. 

Moral of the story: expect weird volatility in GME for a while, but unless SEC forces them to unwind, they will accept any fines they get for “poor practices” and happily keep their billions.

875,GME," They covered yesterday. Or late wednesday. They were taken off the threshold security list, meaning they covered at least the fail to deliver shares (late shorts). The cash infusion from outside the hedgefunds appears to me to have been held a few days and used once the price went down around 90ish $/share. They probably cut a deal to pay less interest on that than they would to the people who lent them the shares to begin with. And the loan is probably spread out over several years. They took a hit to get out of the jam they were in. They still have a lot of shares shorted, but they aren't due yet and so they can wait it out for a little while. The price is gong to drop in mid march when gamestop has to pay out the bonds they sold, according to the above post, which is probably why they were so shorted in the first place. We all have until then to get our money out. Right now, we all need it to drop in price so we can average down our positions to the point where daily fluctuations can get us out without a loss. If you're still holding come mid march, in my opinion, then you are going long long. I'm not waiting that long. I'm buying more low to get my average cost down to something reasonable and selling as soon as the price tops my average. If the 'rocket' takes off before then, great, but I'm not counting on it. I got in too late. My order got cancelled last thursday morning by Robinhood, so by the time I moved some money around and bought in I paid 315/share. Then they stopped all buys and the price tanked. We got screwed by the cronies. Some people make bank. Good for them. Th price almost certainly would have kept going up if the brokers hadn't stopped people from buying. The 1% protected themselves again. Even if the hearings on this or the SEC slaps some fines on them or makes some kind of rule change over this, the damage has already been done. They saved their asses but took a big hit to do so. I didn't make any money on it at all. At this point I'm just looking to break even or take a tiny loss. I'd hold but that mid march thing is coming up and gamestop has to pay those bonds. Best bet in my opinion for anyone who can would be to short GME yourselves right now.

Hello,

My name is \_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_ and I currently own \_\_\_\_ shares of Gamestop stocks. I have reason to believe that the brokerage firms and clearinghouses I've used to make trades have created synthetic stock positions with no ability to actually follow through with them. In order to make sure that these groups are not counterfeiting your company's stock, I request that we hold an emergency shareholder vote. This is necessary in order to shield the company from bankruptcy and minimize potential exposure to massive security fraud. Due to recent events and suspicious trading activity, I would like to also propose a reverse stock split to ensure the legal amount of shares have been issued.

Thank you for your time,

904,TV," I bought in at $320ish and all the way down to $58 at 22 shares total just because I love the idea that people are now shifting mindsets from...”I could waste my money on [insert any consumerist shit, toys, entertainment, new vehicles, etc] that will have a guaranteed loss” to “I can buy something that entertains me, I get ownership in with a bunch of other idiots, and has a possibility of going up in value”.  I think the power of the retail investor is that they are in a completely different universe where the things they are spending money on already have a 100% loss expectation. Nobody is buying a TV thinking they’re going to get some type of return on it later. Or flying to Hawaii thinking they’ll get a refund when they get back home.

1108,GME," Today is your time to decide if you are betting on GME or not.

This was always a play on the short squeeze, the turnaround news is great but we are in this as a technical trade on a value stock.

Tuesday we will see if the media and the hedgefunds lied about covering their short positions at the end of January

Today Robinhood has stopped restricting trades.

Morale is high on WSB. The mod situation has been resolved and many here are so far in the red, it makes no sense to sell.

Even the worst estimates of short interest are still very high for a normal company and many here think they are very far under estimated. Either way we find out TUESDAY.

1109,GME," Going to post a new thread but also here, spread and upvote if you think it's interesting: 

Adding to all the unverified theories about synthetic longs/other fuckery from the hedges is one that would work in our favor...

TL;DR The ""whistleblower"" who posted yesterday deleted his post and account. He claimed he worked at a high finance institution and that the big players have been working together to quietly acquire huge capital, waiting to strike at the right moment by eventually doing targeted high volume buying in order to shoot the price up again and bankrupt any shorting funds/get rich/consolidate market power by wiping the competition. Not to help us retailers, but we can obviously get in on their rocket when (if) it does happen.

YES it could very well be a fake story, but he had posted about working in the industry weeks before the GME blowup happened. (I along with others checked his post history before he deleted, sounded like a incel weirdo but what's surprising about that and a numbers/data guy).

This is where it used to be, anyone know a way to recover deleted posts?

I learned a lot about myself and the risks of betting against big money and their rigged game. In hindsight I should have secured my initial investment but I didn't. For the time being I don't give a flying fuck about this ""revelation"". But for future investments I will be grateful.

I saw the opportunity for life changing money. I wanted to start the process of building my own business with the goal to help people with mental health issues finding a therapist much faster. I fantasised about getring into a new hobby and gain some form of financial freedom. That's why I did something extremely stupid and invested more money than I could afford losing. On the other hand I feel pretty good about it because my depressed ass did only act rational for all my life. Doing something that stupid made me feel alive.

I am still hoping for the stock to rebound and therefore I am holding tight. In the end the difference between being brave or being stupid is determined by the final result.

1246,AMC," I think if it were not for covid the movie industry would be on the way out and dying. People were streaming in home more than ever and other than super hero movies many people just wait to see the movie on their prefered streaming site . Then you had the rise in platforms like  Netflix, Prime video and Disney plus releasing movies you can only stream at home on their platforms. The movie industry was slowly changing already before all the covid and some companies were trying to get on this change . Now with regards to to covid I think that this may be what drastically changes the movie industry back to the way is was before and we will see more people wanting to go to theatres than we have in recent years post pandemic. As covid restrictions let up people will want to  leave the house more than ever. More people will want to go out and feel normal. They will want to do things more than before with their family and friends they are unable to see now.   I'm not in AMC at the moment but I have thought about . Unsure at the moment . But this is my opinion  about the movie industry as a whole. Covid has created an interesting situation.

I would like to bring to your attention some irregularities concerning the recent GME situation. In order to do so I would like to first provide you with a brief primer on how market manipulation works, then give examples of such suspected manipulation that I believe it is important for you to investigate in the upcoming hearing concerning GME.

First it is important to understand what a wash trades and matched trades are. The following link from the SEC describes them on slide #25

https://www.sec.gov/files/Market%20Manipulations%20and%20Case%20Studies.pdf

Such wash sales and matched orders have in the past been used to manipulate both market volume and price. This practice goes back many years and continues today. The following link is another SEC document describing a situation where the market volume and resulting price were manipulated at above 70% of total volume for a year and a half. Please draw your attention to Page 12 paragraph 1 of this document.

https://www.sec.gov/litigation/aljdec/id78grl.txt

“Finally, comparing the total volume of wash trades and matched orders reported with the total volume reported only on those days on which reported wash trades and matched orders occurred, from January 1, 1989 to June 30, 1990, Broumas's trades constituted 73.7% of the reported market volume for JML Class A stock.  From July 1, 1989 to December 31, 1989, the applicable percentage is 72.4%.  From July 1, 1989 to June 30, 1990, the percentage was 73.7%”

However, this document is very old. I present this document to demonstrate that not only is this not a new technique but that in the past such things have been done at high volumes for extended periods of time. As a consequence here is an SEC publication as recent as September 28,2020 which involved the use of wash trades from June 2017 to March 2018

https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2020/lr24920.htm

“According to the SEC's complaint, from at least June 2017 to March 2018, individuals and groups who held large quantities of microcap stocks paid Zinkwich hundreds of thousands of dollars to facilitate a scheme to drive up demand for the stocks of certain issuers.”

Now that we have established how a market can be manipulated both in large volumes and for extended periods of time. I would like to draw your attention to a YouTube video of Jim Cramer, host of CNBC’s Mad Money and former hedge fund manager, describing the hedge fund playbook when they are in a short position.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMuEis3byY4

In this video, Jim Cramer describes how to manipulate the stock price down and describes a strategy in which Hedge Funds “create an uplift, followed by a slow fade” to produce “a real negative feeling” in order to “beleaguer the moron longs”. If you look at the current situation, one might call this an accurate description of what is happening. However, this is not proof of any wrong doing of course. Just an interesting observation. However, Jim Cramer also says that it is also very important to get CNBC on your side. And here we do have some proof of manipulation. I would like to draw your attention to a post by CNBC made Feb 2, 2021 at 9:19AM, just before markets open. The same day that price dropped from over $200 to under $100.

https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/02/as-gamestop-plunges-volkswagens-2008-short-squeeze-gives-an-idea-of-how-painful-it-will-get.html

The problem with this report authored by Yun Li, is that the graph that they present for the Volkswagen 2008 squeeze has been manipulated. Please refer to the image upload in which CNBC’s graph is overlayed with real historical financial data using the same timeframe.

https://imgur.com/a/PETRTdZ#zvRYOfj

Here you can see that the market data is clearly manipulated on the CNBC graph in order to downplay the volatility prior to the 2008 VW squeeze. Obviously, the situation between 2008 and today is very different. As a result, you shouldn’t be comparing the two situations at all. But I am not here to make an argument comparing the two together. All I am showing here is that CNBC presented manipulated data and that’s a simple fact. Now of course if you look at CNBC’s graph, they source it FactSet implying that they didn’t make the graph themselves. However, this is a syndicated news outlet with professional reporters supposedly knowledgeable in their field, and anyone with a few minutes to spare can look up the historical financial data. Do you really believe that the reporter that wrote this or the editors that reviewed it didn’t know that this graph was manipulated?

Let’s assume that you don’t believe that CNBC made an honest mistake. Let’s assume that you don’t believe that Jim Cramer’s description of the hedge funds playbook similarities with the current situation a coincidence. Then I would have to believe that at this point you might be beginning to wonder yourself if there is more going on here.

Which is why I urge you to call on the SEC to testify on this matter. The SEC has announced that they would be watching this situation very carefully. So I believe that in the interest of public trust it is very important to have the SEC testify as to what they are actually doing to protect the public interest. What records have they subpoenaed? What are they actually doing to investigate the matter? One example of something they could, and definitely should, be doing right now is subpoenaing the transaction record to look for matched pairs and wash sales and other irregularities suggesting market manipulation.

For example, take a look at this following image of 4 different stocks real time trade information as posted by Nasdaq.com at the close of Feb. 2, 2021.

https://imgur.com/gallery/rncscA9

If you can guess which one is GME, I think that says a lot. Again, this is not proof of any wrong doing. All financial transactions during regular hours are bundled and presented in the way that Stock C is shown. This is done intentionally to obscure individual transactions. However the SEC can investigate these trades in a way that an individual cannot. Considering all that has happened, I believe it is paramount to the public trust that the SEC be called to testify to determine whether or not they are actually investigating these obscured transactions appropriately.

Not to mention calling CNBC to answer for their publication of manipulated data on the morning before a sudden market decline that so closely matches Jim Cramer’s description of what we should expect.

Please, I implore you as a concerned citizen. Do not let these questions go unanswered. Why did CNBC publish manipulated data, and what has the SEC actually done to secure the public interest while watching this GME situation unfold.

Steam is unkillable and immovable as the top dog in this, the only reason people use epic is fortnite (which is dying) and free games.

1316,IT," Steam is certainly hyper dominant, but they are based off of one time game sales. From a software perspective, that’s really an archaic model, and it doesn’t work well. You get a rush to market of code that’s not really ready because you’ve got to cover your dev costs, then you trickle out patches to fix it. You’re basically using early customers as beta testers, but then you’re reliant on selling DLC and extras to cover your ongoing support costs. And customers hate it because they pay a lot up front for a game that doesn’t really work, and then have to pay more and more for DLC. Read stream reviews for almost any big game on release, and you’ll see this trend. 

The rest of the software industry has gone to “software as a service” which is sorta like Netflix for software. You pay a regular fee based on level of use, and you get everything you need. IT companies get a predictable income stream so they can support games long term, and customers get working software without being nickeled and dimed.

Imagine game stop gets the licensing to offer all their games under a subscription. And I get to pay, say, $19.99/month to play whatever I want, instead of buying lots of games individually, returning some, buying dlc for others, etc. Honestly I’d go for that in a heartbeat, and I’ve got probably 500 games in my steam library. 

In short, yes, stream is currently hyperdominant, but their whole model is wrong for both gamers and game developers. And it’s a problem the software industry has already solved for business, and the TV/movie industry already solved for consumers. They just need to combine the two. Netflix is a quarter trillion dollar company.

Edit: obviously this is all speculative. It’s like buying Tesla in 2015 on what they might become, except that’s a bad example just because we all know TSLA worked out.

1319,TV," Steam is certainly hyper dominant, but they are based off of one time game sales. From a software perspective, that’s really an archaic model, and it doesn’t work well. You get a rush to market of code that’s not really ready because you’ve got to cover your dev costs, then you trickle out patches to fix it. You’re basically using early customers as beta testers, but then you’re reliant on selling DLC and extras to cover your ongoing support costs. And customers hate it because they pay a lot up front for a game that doesn’t really work, and then have to pay more and more for DLC. Read stream reviews for almost any big game on release, and you’ll see this trend. 

The rest of the software industry has gone to “software as a service” which is sorta like Netflix for software. You pay a regular fee based on level of use, and you get everything you need. IT companies get a predictable income stream so they can support games long term, and customers get working software without being nickeled and dimed.

Imagine game stop gets the licensing to offer all their games under a subscription.

1357,GME," Ok - here's my take:

GME has high debt, low equity, and negative eps.  From a valuation perspective, there is no freaking way GME is a $50 stock, let alone a $350 stock.

So we're valuing the stock based on a momentum play and the thesis that the stock will squeeze based on a mistake by people shorting the stock.  I thought this thesis was solid and bought as well.  However, we learned a few things:

- MM, HF, and brokers can kill momentum
- Well connected shorts can move the goalposts by getting backup funding and extending their positions
- The SEC isn't the white knight who's going to ride in and restore a sense of balance to the universe - they are going to get with their buddies from undergrad to reminisce and figure out how to put down the plebes

So given that the momentum and squeeze hypotheses are no longer valid, is GME a bargain at $100, or $50, or $20?  Also, let's say that the squeeze is real and in a couple of months it goes back to $400, what's the opportunity cost of buying and holding GME today at $50 for those months?

I guess what I'm saying is it wasn't wrong to get into GME based on a theory, but it's also not wrong to reevaluate that theory based on new evidence and come to a different conclusion at $50.",Optimistic-Cranberry,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldcapl/its_so_strange_to_me_that_people_will_fomo_in_at/gm5q9x9/,0.071,0.844,0.084,0.2749

WE ARE HERE TO TAKE MASSIVE RISKS BECAUSE WHILE THE OUT OF TOUCH MILLIONAIRES ALL OVER THE WORLD MADE RECORD PROFITS LAST YEAR THEY CLOSED THE ECONOMY SENT YOU A $600 CHECK AND TOLD YOU TO FUCK OFF. THEY WANT YOU TO CONTINUE TO DELIVER THEIR PRIME PACKAGES AND SHOP FOR THEM AT WHOLE FOODS AMIDST A DEADLY PANDEMIC WHILE THEY SIT SAFELY IN THEIR MANSIONS AND TELL YOU YOU’RE AN ESSENTIAL WORKER AND THAT WE’RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

###IT’S IN THEIR INTEREST TO DRIVE DOWN THE PRICE AS LOW AS IT CAN GO. 

SO THEY CAN SLOWLY BUY IT BACK UP A LITTLE AT A TIME AND MINIMIZE THEIR COLOSSAL LOSSES BIGGER THAN THEIR WIFES DILDO BECAUSE THEY ARE THE TRUE RETARDS WHO GOT SO GREEDY, A WEEK AGO THEY WERE ON THE BRINK OF BANKRUPTCY. AND NOW THEY ARE PULLING EVERY DIRTY TRICK IN THE BOOK TO GET YOU TO SELL AND CRASH THE PRICE LOWER AND LOWER.

###THE PUSH TO $500 LAST THURSDAY WAS NOT THE SQUEEZE. 

HOW DO I KNOW THIS? I DON’T KNOW ANYTHING BECAUSE I FOMOED INTO THIS STOCK BECAUSE I READ AT A 3RD GRADE LEVEL AND I FAILED ALGEBRA AND NEVER WENT TO COLLEGE BUT WHEN THE PRICE HIT $500 I KNOW THAT ROBINHOOD REMOVED THE BUY BUTTON TO GET YOU TO STOP BUYING. THEY CRIED FOR MORE REGULATION ON TV. THEY PAID FOR ADS ON CNBC TO GET YOU THINKING THEY COVERED. THEY PURCHASED ADS ON REDDIT TO GET YOU TO BUY SILVER AND DIFFERENT STOCKS. THEY PURCHASED BOTS TO OVERRUN THIS PLACE AND QUESTION WHY YOU BOUGHT IN THE FIRST PLACEE. 



#THIS ISN’T OVER. AND GME IS NOT GOING TO ZERO. IN FACT THE NEW CEO IS HARD AT WORK TO MAKE A HUGE COMEBACK.

###NO THIS ISN’T FINANCIAL ADVICE. 

I DONT KNOW WHAT IM DOING AND IM NOT TELLING YOU WHAT TO DO. I’M JUST APE DIAMOND HAND CLUTCHING 80 SHARES @ 250 AND IM NOT FUCKING SELLING.

THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH.

This is the officially dedicated investor relations number of GameStop. Any GME shareholders can call this and an answering machine will take your call. Go on record with your full name, number of shares and the country you're based in. Tell them you have reason to believe that an emergency shareholder vote has to be called, in order to save the company from bankruptcy. Calling the vote means calling shares back to their owners, eliminating all synthetic stock, and hence taking leverage away from fraudulent shortsellers.

EDIT:

They also have an email in case you can't call

Template written by u/AVeryRealHumanity. Subject: Fears of potential securities fraud

Hello,

and I currently own shares of Gamestop stocks. I have reason to believe that the brokerage firms and clearinghouses I've used to make trades have created synthetic stock positions with no ability to actually follow through with them. In order to make sure that these groups are not counterfeiting your company's stock, I request that we hold an emergency shareholder vote. This is necessary in order to shield the company from bankruptcy and minimize potential exposure to massive security fraud. Due to recent events and suspicious trading activity, I would like to also propose a reverse stock split to ensure the legal amount of shares have been issued.

My name is

Template written by u/AVeryRealHumanity. Subject: Fears of potential securities fraud

Hello,

and I currently own shares of Gamestop stocks. I have reason to believe that the brokerage firms and clearinghouses I've used to make trades have created synthetic stock positions with no ability to actually follow through with them. In order to make sure that these groups are not counterfeiting your company's stock, I request that we hold an emergency shareholder vote. This is necessary in order to shield the company from bankruptcy and minimize potential exposure to massive security fraud. Due to recent events and suspicious trading activity, I would like to also propose a reverse stock split to ensure the legal amount of shares have been issued.

My name is

- Learn difference between gambling, trading and investing.

- If you're looking for slow & consistent growth while focusing on your personal life, 100% index like VGT, VOO.

- If you like building a thesis, picking stocks & higher returns, dedicate 20% of your portfolio to them with the rest in an index 

- Once you learn, and have built up your risk tolerance, you can move up to 50/50. Again, higher risk = higher returns but also losses and required time dedication.

- If you're super into it and willing to put the time to understand stocks, then 100% into companies that actually have growth potential while managing your portfolio.

""According to Fintel website, the amount of shares held by institutional investors based on their 13D/G and 13F filing, is about 114 million. However, the amount of float available to institutional and retail investors is around 50 million. That means over 60 million shares of GME are counterfeit created by short sellers. Every person holding shares makes it more difficult for them to try and clean up this mess.

Subject: Fears of potential securities fraud

Hello,

My name is _____ _____ and I currently own ____ shares of Gamestop stocks. I have reason to believe that the brokerage firms and clearinghouses I've used to make trades have created synthetic stock positions with no ability to actually follow through with them. In order to make sure that these groups are not counterfeiting your company's stock, I request that we hold an emergency shareholder vote. This is necessary in order to shield the company from bankruptcy and minimize potential exposure to massive security fraud. Due to recent events and suspicious trading activity, I would like to also propose a reverse stock split to ensure the legal amount of shares have been issued.

Thank you for your time,

Yes they do. 300*25m = 7.5B. Melvin alone lost almost that much in January from their shorts blowing up. Citadel injected $2.7B into Melvin to help with liquidity. On top of that, there are a lot more funds out there that are short GME.  $7.5B in the grand scheme of Wall Street is not that much.

1992,GME," But if any of them want to actually realize those profits, it will require buying back those short shares to close.

They risk tipping the precarious scale of buy/sell pressure and triggering another run up.

Short squeeze is not just about short sellers avoiding losses but also trying to outmaneuver each other to make the most profit.

The longer they wait to cover collectively, the higher their potential gains, but the first to cover en masse will get the best price, and from there it's a free for all.

If they shorted fresh at $400, and it drops to $40, they are up 90%, with a maximum gain of 100% and that's only if GME is delisted, which is less likely every time they take a step on the right direction operationally.

Again, GME was *never* going to maintain $400. Shorting at that level is literally free/guaranteed money.

If they want to keep holding their longs and still remain market neutral, then it makes sense to hold/increase their short position.

Subject: Fears of potential securities fraud

Hello,

My name is _____ _____ and I currently own ____ shares of Gamestop stocks. I have reason to believe that the brokerage firms and clearinghouses I've used to make trades have created synthetic stock positions with no ability to actually follow through with them. In order to make sure that these groups are not counterfeiting your company's stock, I request that we hold an emergency shareholder vote. This is necessary in order to shield the company from bankruptcy and minimize potential exposure to massive security fraud. Due to recent events and suspicious trading activity, I would like to also propose a reverse stock split to ensure the legal amount of shares have been issued.

Thank you for your time,

2089,GME," Serious question: Why do you guys think this is manipulation instead of just a lack of buyers? You can't push a stock down unless you sell to all the buyers at that level, and then sell to all the buyers at the next level, and then sell to all the buyers at the next level below that, right? 

I'm not retarded, I understand the concept that people can push stocks around with enough money. But there's another concept buried in there: the money you use to push stocks around is spent selling to buyers until there aren't any left. Doesn't that simply mean that if it costs them very little to push the price around, that there weren't many buyers at those levels? If there were more buyers at those levels, it would have cost them much more money to sell to all of them and break through to lower levels, right? 

This is something that always puzzled me about the GME rhetoric. Yes, not selling is a good first step to keep a stock price up. Diamond hands are useful. But, if there aren't new buyers, or enough new buyers, or more new buyers than sellers, then the price will naturally fall with very little shares trading hands, right? 

Just as an example, imagine there's a bid at $100 and an ask at $120. The stock can go up or down 20% every tick if one guy sells at the bid and a second later someone buys at the ask. Now imagine there's very few buyers sprinkled throughout the $100 to $120 region. A few sellers can push right through it all on minimal volume, and it's not really manipulation... it's a lack of buyers.

2094,CTO," Potentially, but then why would the company lose value after the employment of the additional board members in charge of fulfillment at Amazon, customer service from Chewy, and the CTO of Amazon?

Amazon is mostly order fulfillment and online website design and hosting anyway. If there were people to take from these companies from a fundamental standpoint, these are among the most valuable people.

The reason this isn't larger news is simply because the smaller hedge funds probably have the media in their grasp. If the squeeze was squoze, wouldn't it make sense to say hey, look at GAMESTOP!! Look at who they just hired and why it's great!! But... that didn't happen. They don't want *anyone* buying GME because the squeeze really hasn't squoze and until we realize that, nobody is going to help us. Hedges for and against us will take options relative to whatever direction we seem to be moving and hope to profit. At this point, the best thing to do if we want true justice for wall street is to hold the stock and wait for the SEC or a vote count, or a reverse stock split. Sure, buy more if you like, but this status quo will remain until we lose momentum or we paper hand the shares so they can cover. Most of these calls are a month or two out.

2098,DD," There's only two possibilities with the coup you're talking about. Either Trump tried to overthrow the results of the election and stage a coup while claiming he's been the target of the deep state and endless attacks of him being a Russian spy for Putin or everything the media that said about him is correct. 

Right now this is where I stand. I lost my ass in the market when Joy Behar announced Flynn met with Russians and the market dropped 350 points. The story was fake and they had to retract it. https://nypost.com/2017/12/02/abc-news-corrects-flynn-bombshell-after-stocks-tank/

Ultimately, for four years the trust in the media has eroded. They say what they want, then issue retractions online where no one reads them. They call us Russians and bots. They stop trading. 

Millionaires and Billionaires go on TV and cry about fairness. They investigate us and DFV instead of their friends. This storm was coming because Apes realized the theft that was going to take place and banded together. 

Plus, not all billionaires are bad per se, and there was one as president that turned the market around and added jobs to stimulate the economy. I don't like him personally, but since this sub is enriched with apes doing their DD, you can clearly see that the media was wrong about so much when he got elected. Markets will tank. Jobs aren't coming back because he doesn't have a magic wand. 

We know that fear is a motivator and the media peddles it all the time. Take away any emotion of Trump and look at the numbers and you'll see he ran America like a business, and it was going great. I'm not saying Trump is the second coming, but I find that he definitely emulates a lot of the sentiment on this sub. Patience to wait for the opportunity to strike and win big. This sub is realizing that they've always been stealing from us and no one's looking out for the little guy. 

One can do their DD and see countless times Trump was awarded for helping minority communities and disavowing David Duke and the KKK yet we continue to hear that he supports them. https://youtu.be/ZekCxN_8KPA

Now asks yourselves: do you really trust the media? Do you really believe what the experts are telling you in regards to the market and those of us on r/wsb?

I'm not at all wearing a tin foil hat or what not, but I find it very interesting when I actually listen to the orange ape and what he said would happen in the Middle East and North Korea, I wonder if he predicted a lot of things we weren't aware of happening at the time.

2108,GME," Bro. Yesterday was less than 40m traded and today its 77m, you tell me I'm no expert but I think GME was #5 most traded today?  They are both high volume. Earlier this week we had 22m days, which is still top 50. I don't understand what makes this hard to understand. You can clearly see that the there are more buyers than sellers based on inflow and outflow, the price falls, and you're confused as to why it's not manipulated? In what world do stocks prices fall as they are bought up, while simultaneously more money is being put into them, than leaving them?

Let me go a little further. In a small time frame, the sell orders grew 0.34%, and stock falls 6.91% on the fifth most traded stock in the market. Those sell orders are only worth 4 mil, but somehow the computer says the company is worth 224m less than prior to that. How does that make sense? Somehow a small net % growth of OVERALL SELLS relative to OVERALL BUYS, which was the 58k shares, made a difference of almost 224m.",CorrectPoetry0,-2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldd1s5/do_you_need_proof_of_manipulated_markets_here_you/gm5rmir/,0.032,0.863,0.105,0.9335

2110,GME," That's not the premise of your post, though.

This is what your post said:

>In 21 minutes, Sell orders of GME grew only 0.34%. Despite this, the price of the stock fell 6.91%.

Nothing here contradicts my point. This is a well-documented problem in stock trading, and it's not proof of market manipulation.

You have to tie order batches to specific swings and show intent.",mrpoopistan,4,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldd1s5/do_you_need_proof_of_manipulated_markets_here_you/gm5scj0/,0.072,0.898,0.03,-0.4337
2111,OR," So what the bots do is make sure some percentage of their trades act at the bid, and some other percent at the ask. It's extremely easy to manipulate when there's low to no volume. Take this, for example. There is an offer to buy from a real human at $100.10. There are very few real organic buyers (low volume, low liquidity).  If you sell into that, it counts as hitting the bid (ie a seller). So instead, you put an offer to sell at 100.11 and your next offer to sell at 100.15.  You can also put an offer to buy beneath that guy, with a nice gap, to scare him, say at 100.03.  Then you wait. When the buyer sees that the bid beneath him is 100.03, he's at 100.10, and the ask is 100.11, and that if someone else takes that ask he'll have to pay 100.15, he will very often move up the penny to hit the ask. Boom. You've converted a sell into a buy. 

You can also just put a buy price a bit far below (say 100.03) with no other trades, hoping to encourage the guy bidding 100.10 to lower his price a bit. Why should you pay 7c more than the next guy? Why not lower it to 3c or 2c? When he lowers his price to 100.04, you lower your ask to 100.05, and that guy will likely hit the ask. Now it counts as a buy, not a sell. 

It's mostly a waiting game. You present the organic trader with a ""you can get what you want for almost the exact price you want OR you can risk missing the trade (someone moves the price up 5c) or the risk that he buys and then the price drops 10c.  These games are played all the time. The market makers nad funds can move their bids nad asks around all the time to enduce you to hit their liquidity.

Also, if the cost drops slowly, but the volatility decreases, your put loses value even with the underlying stock dropping.

2320,GME," Please, everyone contact your congress members. Particularly if you live in a district with a member serving on the house financial services committee. Here is a link to a list of committee members.

-------------------------------------------------------

I would like to bring to your attention some irregularities concerning the recent GME situation. In order to do so I would like to first provide you with a brief primer on how market manipulation works, then give examples of such suspected manipulation that I believe it is important for you to investigate in the upcoming hearing concerning GME.

First it is important to understand what a wash trades and matched trades are. The following link from the SEC describes them on slide #25

https://www.sec.gov/files/Market%20Manipulations%20and%20Case%20Studies.pdf

Such wash sales and matched orders have in the past been used to manipulate both market volume and price. This practice goes back many years and continues today. The following link is another SEC document describing a situation where the market volume and resulting price were manipulated at above 70% of total volume for a year and a half. Please draw your attention to Page 12 paragraph 1 of this document.

https://www.sec.gov/litigation/aljdec/id78grl.txt

“Finally, comparing the total volume of wash trades and matched orders reported with the total volume reported only on those days on which reported wash trades and matched orders occurred, from January 1, 1989 to June 30, 1990, Broumas's trades constituted 73.7% of the reported market volume for JML Class A stock.  From July 1, 1989 to December 31, 1989, the applicable percentage is 72.4%.  From July 1, 1989 to June 30, 1990, the percentage was 73.7%”

However, this document is very old. I present this document to demonstrate that not only is this not a new technique but that in the past such things have been done at high volumes for extended periods of time. As a consequence here is an SEC publication as recent as September 28,2020 which involved the use of wash trades from June 2017 to March 2018

https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2020/lr24920.htm

“According to the SEC's complaint, from at least June 2017 to March 2018, individuals and groups who held large quantities of microcap stocks paid Zinkwich hundreds of thousands of dollars to facilitate a scheme to drive up demand for the stocks of certain issuers.”

Now that we have established how a market can be manipulated both in large volumes and for extended periods of time. I would like to draw your attention to a YouTube video of Jim Cramer, host of CNBC’s Mad Money and former hedge fund manager, describing the hedge fund playbook when they are in a short position.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMuEis3byY4

In this video, Jim Cramer describes how to manipulate the stock price down and describes a strategy in which Hedge Funds “create an uplift, followed by a slow fade” to produce “a real negative feeling” in order to “beleaguer the moron longs”. If you look at the current situation, one might call this an accurate description of what is happening. However, this is not proof of any wrong doing of course. Just an interesting observation. However, Jim Cramer also says that it is also very important to get CNBC on your side. And here we do have some proof of manipulation. I would like to draw your attention to a post by CNBC made Feb 2, 2021 at 9:19AM, just before markets open. The same day that price dropped from over $200 to under $100.

https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/02/as-gamestop-plunges-volkswagens-2008-short-squeeze-gives-an-idea-of-how-painful-it-will-get.html

The problem with this report authored by Yun Li, is that the graph that they present for the Volkswagen 2008 squeeze has been manipulated. Please refer to the image upload in which CNBC’s graph is overlayed with real historical financial data using the same timeframe.

https://imgur.com/a/PETRTdZ#zvRYOfj

Here you can see that the market data is clearly manipulated on the CNBC graph in order to downplay the volatility prior to the 2008 VW squeeze. Obviously, the situation between 2008 and today is very different. As a result, you shouldn’t be comparing the two situations at all. But I am not here to make an argument comparing the two together. All I am showing here is that CNBC presented manipulated data and that’s a simple fact. Now of course if you look at CNBC’s graph, they source it FactSet implying that they didn’t make the graph themselves. However, this is a syndicated news outlet with professional reporters supposedly knowledgeable in their field, and anyone with a few minutes to spare can look up the historical financial data. Do you really believe that the reporter that wrote this or the editors that reviewed it didn’t know that this graph was manipulated?

Let’s assume that you don’t believe that CNBC made an honest mistake. Let’s assume that you don’t believe that Jim Cramer’s description of the hedge funds playbook similarities with the current situation a coincidence. Then I would have to believe that at this point you might be beginning to wonder yourself if there is more going on here.

Which is why I urge you to call on the SEC to testify on this matter. The SEC has announced that they would be watching this situation very carefully. So I believe that in the interest of public trust it is very important to have the SEC testify as to what they are actually doing to protect the public interest. What records have they subpoenaed? What are they actually doing to investigate the matter? One example of something they could, and definitely should, be doing right now is subpoenaing the transaction record to look for matched pairs and wash sales and other irregularities suggesting market manipulation.

For example, take a look at this following image of 4 different stocks real time trade information as posted by Nasdaq.com at the close of Feb. 2, 2021.

https://imgur.com/gallery/rncscA9

If you can guess which one is GME, I think that says a lot. Again, this is not proof of any wrong doing. All financial transactions during regular hours are bundled and presented in the way that Stock C is shown. This is done intentionally to obscure individual transactions. However the SEC can investigate these trades in a way that an individual cannot. Considering all that has happened, I believe it is paramount to the public trust that the SEC be called to testify to determine whether or not they are actually investigating these obscured transactions appropriately.

Not to mention calling CNBC to answer for their publication of manipulated data on the morning before a sudden market decline that so closely matches Jim Cramer’s description of what we should expect.

Please, I implore you as a concerned citizen. Do not let these questions go unanswered. Why did CNBC publish manipulated data, and what has the SEC actually done to secure the public interest while watching this GME situation unfold.

Sincerely,

-------------------------------------------------------

I would like to bring to your attention some irregularities concerning the recent GME situation. In order to do so I would like to first provide you with a brief primer on how market manipulation works, then give examples of such suspected manipulation that I believe it is important for you to investigate in the upcoming hearing concerning GME.

First it is important to understand what a wash trades and matched trades are. The following link from the SEC describes them on slide #25

https://www.sec.gov/files/Market%20Manipulations%20and%20Case%20Studies.pdf

Such wash sales and matched orders have in the past been used to manipulate both market volume and price. This practice goes back many years and continues today. The following link is another SEC document describing a situation where the market volume and resulting price were manipulated at above 70% of total volume for a year and a half. Please draw your attention to Page 12 paragraph 1 of this document.

https://www.sec.gov/litigation/aljdec/id78grl.txt

“Finally, comparing the total volume of wash trades and matched orders reported with the total volume reported only on those days on which reported wash trades and matched orders occurred, from January 1, 1989 to June 30, 1990, Broumas's trades constituted 73.7% of the reported market volume for JML Class A stock.  From July 1, 1989 to December 31, 1989, the applicable percentage is 72.4%.  From July 1, 1989 to June 30, 1990, the percentage was 73.7%”

However, this document is very old. I present this document to demonstrate that not only is this not a new technique but that in the past such things have been done at high volumes for extended periods of time. As a consequence here is an SEC publication as recent as September 28,2020 which involved the use of wash trades from June 2017 to March 2018

https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2020/lr24920.htm

“According to the SEC's complaint, from at least June 2017 to March 2018, individuals and groups who held large quantities of microcap stocks paid Zinkwich hundreds of thousands of dollars to facilitate a scheme to drive up demand for the stocks of certain issuers.”

Now that we have established how a market can be manipulated both in large volumes and for extended periods of time. I would like to draw your attention to a YouTube video of Jim Cramer, host of CNBC’s Mad Money and former hedge fund manager, describing the hedge fund playbook when they are in a short position.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMuEis3byY4

In this video, Jim Cramer describes how to manipulate the stock price down and describes a strategy in which Hedge Funds “create an uplift, followed by a slow fade” to produce “a real negative feeling” in order to “beleaguer the moron longs”. If you look at the current situation, one might call this an accurate description of what is happening. However, this is not proof of any wrong doing of course. Just an interesting observation. However, Jim Cramer also says that it is also very important to get CNBC on your side. And here we do have some proof of manipulation. I would like to draw your attention to a post by CNBC made Feb 2, 2021 at 9:19AM, just before markets open. The same day that price dropped from over $200 to under $100.

https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/02/as-gamestop-plunges-volkswagens-2008-short-squeeze-gives-an-idea-of-how-painful-it-will-get.html

The problem with this report authored by Yun Li, is that the graph that they present for the Volkswagen 2008 squeeze has been manipulated. Please refer to the image upload in which CNBC’s graph is overlayed with real historical financial data using the same timeframe.

https://imgur.com/a/PETRTdZ#zvRYOfj

Here you can see that the market data is clearly manipulated on the CNBC graph in order to downplay the volatility prior to the 2008 VW squeeze. Obviously, the situation between 2008 and today is very different. As a result, you shouldn’t be comparing the two situations at all. But I am not here to make an argument comparing the two together. All I am showing here is that CNBC presented manipulated data and that’s a simple fact. Now of course if you look at CNBC’s graph, they source it FactSet implying that they didn’t make the graph themselves. However, this is a syndicated news outlet with professional reporters supposedly knowledgeable in their field, and anyone with a few minutes to spare can look up the historical financial data. Do you really believe that the reporter that wrote this or the editors that reviewed it didn’t know that this graph was manipulated?

Let’s assume that you don’t believe that CNBC made an honest mistake. Let’s assume that you don’t believe that Jim Cramer’s description of the hedge funds playbook similarities with the current situation a coincidence. Then I would have to believe that at this point you might be beginning to wonder yourself if there is more going on here.

Which is why I urge you to call on the SEC to testify on this matter. The SEC has announced that they would be watching this situation very carefully. So I believe that in the interest of public trust it is very important to have the SEC testify as to what they are actually doing to protect the public interest. What records have they subpoenaed? What are they actually doing to investigate the matter? One example of something they could, and definitely should, be doing right now is subpoenaing the transaction record to look for matched pairs and wash sales and other irregularities suggesting market manipulation.

For example, take a look at this following image of 4 different stocks real time trade information as posted by Nasdaq.com at the close of Feb. 2, 2021.

https://imgur.com/gallery/rncscA9

If you can guess which one is GME, I think that says a lot. Again, this is not proof of any wrong doing. All financial transactions during regular hours are bundled and presented in the way that Stock C is shown. This is done intentionally to obscure individual transactions. However the SEC can investigate these trades in a way that an individual cannot. Considering all that has happened, I believe it is paramount to the public trust that the SEC be called to testify to determine whether or not they are actually investigating these obscured transactions appropriately.

Not to mention calling CNBC to answer for their publication of manipulated data on the morning before a sudden market decline that so closely matches Jim Cramer’s description of what we should expect.

Please, I implore you as a concerned citizen. Do not let these questions go unanswered. Why did CNBC publish manipulated data, and what has the SEC actually done to secure the public interest while watching this GME situation unfold.

Sincerely,

I have a very unpopular opinion on this one. I don't think they need to waste their money holding a meeting and I think a reverse stock split is stupid. 

Cohen has hired some truly amazing talent to turn this company around. He needs time to get this done. Forgive me for being pessimistic about this community's outlook on GME and intentions, but 99% of the people invested are posers who bought on during the squeeze and don't know shit about GME other than it could be a way to screw the HFs. We already had a shareholder meeting in November, in which the people who actually care about this company said their piece, and Cohen is now executing as the ""real"" shareholders requested. He needs to execute his $100M share dilution option to get the capital he needs to polish off the transformation, not a reverse stock split.

All this piece of shit is promoting in his post is a way to force the remaining short sellers to exit all at once to try to squeeze this a little more.

Subject: Fears of potential securities fraud

Hello,

My name is _____ _____ and I currently own ____ shares of Gamestop stocks. I have reason to believe that the brokerage firms and clearinghouses I've used to make trades have created synthetic stock positions with no ability to actually follow through with them. In order to make sure that these groups are not counterfeiting your company's stock, I request that we hold an emergency shareholder vote. This is necessary in order to shield the company from bankruptcy and minimize potential exposure to massive security fraud. Due to recent events and suspicious trading activity, I would like to also propose a reverse stock split to ensure the legal amount of shares have been issued.

Thank you for your time,

Power to the players,

Because 5G upgrade is coming.Then why Nök >5$?About 10+ years ago, guy named Elop snuck in and became CEO, told them to stop using Symbian OS (Which was very good but needed to pivot with the smartphone disruption) and to use Microsoft. (Elop was a suit at Msft before moving to Nök.) Elop smashed and disrupted Nök's position in the phone industry (sold the smartphone division to Msft, it became Msft Mobile) - then after a few years left, leaving a destroyed company but paying himself 18+ million in bonuses. He's like a Trojan horse. Then he went back to work at Msft.  - Convenient, innit? What happens when you destroy a company's major revenue generator? Stock falls. Peeps get laid off. Not good times. Also idiots think they still do phones. (Like BB!)So for over a decade Nök has been quietly plodding away building up their communications infrastructure tech. Why do peeps like Nök?
