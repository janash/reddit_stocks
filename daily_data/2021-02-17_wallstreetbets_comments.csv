7,REAL," I am laughing at the hero worship going on here.  To be clear, the Hedge Funds suck and are abusing the system.  I hope that the inquiry leads to real change and accountability for Wallstreet but I am doubtful based on the past.  All of that being said, the idea that DFV is some sort of folk hero looking out for the common man/investory is hilarious.  Here is the REAL tale.  He saw a stock he felt was undervalued (over a year ago if I read correctly).  He bought shares in opposition of the short purchases from the HFs.  He encouraged others directly or indirectly to invest because the stock was undervalued based on his estimation.  He at some point sold some of his holding for an estimated $11M+ gain.  He continued to hold some shares.  The meme blew up even bigger and a ton of goofs got wrapped up in the fervor and were buying a WAY over valued stock to make a point.  God knows what the point was.  Smart people began selling for a number of reasons to take profits.  Some of it was the meme fading, some was people made a boatload but knew it couldn't last so took profits, some because of factors like RH and other limiting trades and the price receding.  And a ton of fools were left bag holding because they weren't in on the fact Wallstreetbets is about making money.  It isn't some cause subreddit.  To be clear, I don't believe DFV did anything wrong based on what we know.  I do believe RH and other may have abused their positions and relationships with HFs.  But at the end of the day, DFV isn't some folk hero.  He was a dude smart enough to use a situation to make some money.

*Congresswoman Waters: All right Mr. Value, you've got the floor.*

*Mr. Value: Congresswoman Waters, this is a philosophical statement and would take about ten minutes to read, so I'll not do that. One of the first things that an autist learns in a healthy market is trust, and I trust what you have said that you will read this. It's very important to me. I care deeply about autists.*

*Congresswoman Waters: Will it make you happy if you read it?*

*Mr. Value: I'd just like to talk about it, if it's alright. My first option play was on SNDK fifteen years ago, and its growth was 158%. Now, with the help of YouTube and WallStreetBets, as well as all of the affiliated subreddits -- each subreddit plays a role in GME’s progress. It's a unique kind of funding from uneducated smoothbrains. With this help, now our progress had hit an All Time High of $530. It may sound like quite a difference, but $530 was less than two percent of the distance to Mars. Two percent of animated, what I sometimes say, bombardment. I'm very much concerned, as I know you are, about what's being manipulated away from our autists in this country. And I've worked in the field of autist development for six years now, trying to understand the inner needs of autists. We deal with such things as -- as the inner drama of WallStreetBets. We don’t have to bop somebody over the head to...make drama on WallStreetBets. We deal with such things as Rambo Memes, or impressive loss porn, and the kind of anger that arises in simple comment sections. And we do it constructively.*

*Congresswoman Waters: How long of a stock play was it?*

*Mr. Value: I posted positions every day. Most autists schedule poste in the noontime as well as in the evening. WSB here worked for me to schedule it in the late afternoon.*

*Congresswoman Waters: Could we get a copy of them so that we can see them? Maybe not today, but I'd like to see the positions.*

*Mr. Value: I'd like very much for you to see them.*

*Congresswoman Waters: I'd like to see the positions myself, or any one of them.*

*Mr. Value: I made a hundred posts for WSB, the Leastlearned Uneducational Network, and then when the stock price ran down, people in Boston and Pittsburgh and Chicago all came to the fore and said we've got to have more of this GNE Diamond hands inspiration. And this is what -- This is what I give. I give an inspiration of Diamond hands every day to each autist, to help him realize that he isn’t unique. I bought each GME stock by saying, ""You've made this day a special day, by just your being you. There's no stock in the whole market like you, and I like you, just the way you are."" And I feel that if we in public markets can only make it clear that holding is mentionable and manageable, we will have done a great service for mental health. I think that it's much more dramatic that two men could be working out their holdings of anger -- much more dramatic than showing something of lucky gains. I'm constantly concerned about what our autists are seeing, and for 15 years I have tried in this country and Canada, to present what I feel is a meaningful expression of holding.*

*Congresswoman Waters: Do you livestream it?*

*Mr. Value: I'm the host, yes. And I do all the roaring and I am the kitty, and I write all the scripts --*

*Congresswoman Waters: Well, I'm supposed to be a pretty tough gal, and this is the first time I've had goose bumps for the last two days.*

*Mr. Value: Well, I'm grateful, not only for your goose bumps, but for your interest in -- in our kind of community. Could I tell you the words of one of the songs, which I feel is very important?*

*Congresswoman Waters: Yes.*

*Mr. Value: This has to do with that good feeling of control which I feel that autists need to know is there. And it starts out, ""What do you do with the mad that you feel?"" And that first line came straight from a retard. I work with retards doing memes in -- in very personal communication with large groups:*

*What do you do with the mad that you feel? When you feel so mad you could bite. When the whole wide world seems oh so wrong, and nothing you do seems very right. What do you do? Do you punch Andrew Left? Do you pound some Melvin or some Vlad? Do you round up friends for a GameStop run or see how high you go? It's great to be able to hold when you've found a thing that's wrong. And be able to do something great instead, and think this song:*

*‘I GameStop when I want to. GameStop when I wish. Can’t Stop, Won’t Stop, GameStop anytime....And what a good feeling to feel like this! And know that the feeling is really mine. Know that there's something deep inside that helps us become what we can. For a girl can be someday a lady, and a boy can be someday a man.'*

1. They push that there was a collective strategy by reddit to create the short squeeze. DVF better throw in their faces his long history with GME and how ridiculed he was.

2. They mention fraud and manipulation but do not discuss specific accusations against the HF. They better asked the HF CEO under oath and penalty of perjury whether 1. they covered their shares like they stated on the news, 2. Whether they have engaged in any trading that is responsible for the price dip, 3. whether they ever communicated with Robinhood at all during the event.

I am very wary that we are going to hear a lot of shit about how the market has been made into an arcade for inexperienced investors to get lost in and how ""we need to be protected,"" when the real questions should be focusing on HF intentionally killing companies by shorting their stock, how did they manage to leave themselves so exposed to risk, and why the fuck the SEC does not do a god damn thing they're supposed to.",WiredEgo,200,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/llt8oo/tomorrow_live_from_the_capitol_21821_12pm_et/gnrj1yn/,0.185,0.704,0.11,-0.953

You're selling someone the option to buy a stock on a specific date for a specific price, no matter what the actual price is. So if you bet right, you get to offer to sell them $100 worth of stock for $200, which they won't accept. But if you bet wrong, you might have to sell $200 worth of stuff for only $100.

She shattered everything wholesome that we had of her.  It was hilarious.  My breathing still stops for a moment when I hear her talking like that.

203,GME," Just do it now, it might be the best chance for it to reach 1k(more likely 100 tbh) before EOY honestly. Unless you need it to hit 1k to afford a decent camera...if that is your issue let me know.

I mean advertisement in porn? Only multi-billion dollar industries do that atm, why not be the first few to change that? Perhaps this single act may give back some power to retail investors....or it could just make a dent. Either way I feel like doing what you set out to do is the right course of action 100% of the time. If you truly intended to film it, film it despite GME never reaching 1k. I mean if you were willing to film one if GME hits 1k, why are you not willing now when it can only help your cause? If your video helped give GME even a small spike it would help millions. 

I only say these 'absurd' things because I feel like most subs here don't realize the true intent of WSB. Put up or shut up. You think it makes a difference if GME hits 1k and you make a porno? I wouldn't even film one if I became a multi-millionaire overnight, because why should I have to? It's because of this(unless you reveal your position), that you might as well do what you said. It can honestly only help GME in the long-run and perhaps create a new forum for investors to gather, since many already watch porn and are the future of the market.

276,GME," Like a few others, just curious if someone can ELI-ape-brain this to me? Here’s what I’m getting from this: 
1) Hedges over short GME 2) Retail buys GME to force a squeeze on shorts and now very ITM options 3) GME price peaks, not because of squeeze but retail demand trying to get in on the game 4) Rather than hedges doing what they are F-ing supposed to, which is actually buy the stocks to cover shorts and ITM options, they just say “sorry, retail has all the stocks and their too expensive so we’re just not gonna buy right now.” I know nothing of the fines for this, but paying the fine is probably cheaper then covering their positions at that point. 5) Since hedges are just failing to deliver and not covering their positions, GME price settles down because retail has bought all the appetite they could afford/Robinhood BS/paperhanded BS. 6) As days pass, hedges continue to just “fail to deliver” and so demand/price remain low 7)Continuing to keep it low by failing to deliver not only keeps 💎🙌🏻 from getting their juice but it also continues to push more and more options OTM (remember when the highest option was $90). 
So it seems like if the hedges were forced to cover, not only would they have the losses of already failed to deliver contracts to answer for, but that demand would have also caused a multitude more options to have been ITM over the past couple weeks. So failing to deliver feels like a manipulation of the market demand to also keep future options OTM as well. So many of those holders are also being cheated out of earnings by this continuous fail to deliver.

277,DD," The failure to delivers did indeed decrease majorly on Jan 29th, which does lead people to think that the hedge funds and other have indeed covered the majority of their position, payed their FTD's back, and a squeeze is out of the game.

Remove the brackets for the etf symbol, modds have been taking down any posts involved in this \[not gonna address why at this point\]

This etf had a massive increase on failure to delivers, from 10,000 to over 2 million Failure to Delivers. This is something that just doesn't happen normally.

But how does this relate to gamestok? This ETF holds 20% of its shares in gamestok. Not only that, but the exact date the FTD's spiked was the day it dropped on gamestok (January 29th.)

Basically what happened is the hedges are shorting this other etf as a way to hide what they actually own in gamestok.

298,GME," unfortunately a lot of guys got in at 300+ and maybe if Robinhood didn't ban trading we could have sqouze to 1k+ but unfortunately shit hit the fan and we all got fucked out of profits. I understand why they still want the squeeze to happen, and sure the short interest is still high. However, there is no way to squeeze the people who started shorting at anything above 150. These people are pretty much set up to make a nice profit, and sure they will eventually buy back but the average short squeeze sees prices drop 85-95% of peak. Im long term bullish GME but I still think theres a lot of room for it to continue to go down. And also, short squeezes are typically done by one person owning a majority of the float. Look at the aftermath when a bunch of retail investors cause upside momentum on a stock. Sure lots of people made profits, but look how many bagholders there are, and also how are you supposed to effectively squeeze a stock when you can't make sure everyone doesn't sell. Im sure you'd find a lot of people who paperhanded before red Monday who were part of the reason why Melvin and co could exit their position.

309,GME, I agree but I think retail wasn't really holding as much as we all thought. Think about people like Dave who bought and then sold like two days later. There was a lot of people like that. When you have one guy holding on you can determine the price a lot better than 8M autists and Barstool bros. From a Game theory standpoint you're pretty much better off selling early than trying to wait it out as you can't be guaranteed to hit the top of the short squeeze. And I know a lot of us got burned because of people who bought between 150 and 250 and saw profits and took them instead of waiting for the real profits.

I do not feel bad saying I hope that Steve Cohen and Gabe Plotkin die painful deaths.

They blatantly cheated in the middle of trading days, shut down markets, stole hundreds of millions of dollars from all of us.

Now they are calling in favors from the million dollar bribe they paid Janet Yellen, and using the government against us to torture a man who legally and legitimately beat them at their own rigged game.

I hate these fuckers with a passion that I don’t know is equaled in any other area of life.

All because what, Gabe Plotkin had to wait an extra week for the tennis court at his 44 million dollar palace?

Yeah you shouldn't have been in it to try to somehow change your life with a maybe 300% gain tops under the best possible circumstances anyone could have anticipated. It was a gamble at best and you should have realistically understood the risk

443,GME," I was talking about using covered calls for the up side.

The only risk I see in this play is GME deciding to go to the moon without being able to purchase shares. If I wanted to play the up move, then I would use credit received from puts to buy 100 shares and then take the other money and move it to some sort of safer asset. That way I get to participate in the up side whilst maintaining a lower total risk profile.

The above is what I have been doing, just not nearly at the scale you have been doing it. I decided I could commit 8k to this play, so I have been selling 2 of the 40P, then using that credit to buy 2 shares of GME, then moving the rest of the money into ""safer"" assets.

The way I look at this play is it is a siege and I do not want to overextend my portfolio on a play that may or may not work near term, especially when I have what I perceive as better near term opportunities.

Like if you shorted $1M worth at the peak, you get all that cash up front the moment you take the short contract. That $1M is yours no matter what, and you are then on the hook for interest fees until you pay back the stock loan. The question is then if you want to buy out your short now when the stock will cost you $200k, or wait a bit and exit by paying out at $20k.

Not actually true; when you short, you have to post collateral with the broker of the guy who you borrowed the shares from.

This is perhaps the most important lesson people (hopefully) learnt from the GME hype.

So many people didn't seem to realise (or ignored) the fact that once the brokers restricted buys on GME it completely changed the game. The momentum and trader trust in the stock was completely ruined. There's no way it could get it back.

For me it was a huge red flag, and I sold in waves above $300/share making out with some decent gains for the money I put in.

Check out the mvis sub for HEAVY DD. 

Bare minimum fair market value would be 30ish dollars for the lidar tech compared to other companies in the field. That’s the lowest fair market value. But mvis is ready to roll out mass production this year. Everyone else in lidar is literally years away from any kind of product and mvis specs are better than what these other companies are projecting. So not only is mvis first but they are better. 

And the crazy thing is lidar is only ONE of the five verticals mvis has. Another major one is the AR tech behind microsoft hololens. They literally make the driving tech behind the hololens. 

Also, You guys ever see military action movies where all the soldiers have glasses that give info, maps etc live time. Yea they make that also. It’s called IVAS. 

Y’all remember those laser projected keyboards you can type on? Yea that also. Apparently they are making some type of interactive projection for vehicles that were suppose to roll out this year but the car manufactures weren’t ready. 

There’s other really cool verticals as well if you want to look into it. 

The stock is sitting at 20ish bucks right now. That’s way to low just for the lidar. 

Another kicker is they are openly looking for a buyout as well which is driving the price up. Logic stands to dictate who would want actual lidar in their cars for testing this year and who would want to have the tech behind Microsoft’s hololens. Would Microsoft let that tech go to another company ? Who knows really.

I started with 500 shares at .25 and only added after I dove into this company. Pushing $200k plus in profits and I have already paid off all my debts with this stock alone.

587,MVIS," I found someone mentioning MVIS in the daily thread a few months ago when it was $2. I bought a bunch of calls and didn't expect it to spike to $9 like a week later. Doubled my account value and I sold off and it dropped back to $5 and I forgot about it. Now I've been watching it climb every day like 10% lol. Today it's down 15% to $20, so might be a good point for reentry. I decided to do a few debit call spreads so I could afford to get in on a little bit of money and I set my strikes kinda wide at $20/$25 so I could catch more upside instead of a $1 spread.

3x $20/$25 call debit spreads cost me $375

649,PLTR," I have trashed Palantir in a couple posts, but you're not wrong. Volatility and speculation are the name of the game. It could pan out long term, and if it does people who buy now could make out like bandits.

It could also go very, very badly. Palantir has limited borrowing ability and is getting a really large percentage of its cash flow from issuing new stocks. If their equity tanks (more) it means they can't get as much cash.

For most companies if their equity goes down 20-30% that's really bad, but you average down and hold and you'll be fine long term. For Palantir if their equity goes down 20-30% they can't make payroll.

https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PLTR/cash-flow/

I have been wrong before. I thought Tesla was fucked 6 years ago. 4 years ago I said Amazon would pay a dividend within 5 years (I now think I'm going to be wrong). But I've also been right before.

677,DD," Thank you for posting this, I have been trying to get people to understand that selling puts is the way to go. 

If we have people buying a share per put, WSB can easily create a situation where there are no shares to short, especially if everyone opts out of the broker borrow program. This way they can't just sell the share you just bought back to you. They will have to create FTDs in the system to maintain their liquidity requirements. As well as using puts to force MMs to have naked short shares on their books.

Selling puts and adding 1 share per put is probably the best way to handle this situation.

This allows people to keep powder dry, take profits and buy more shares.

I think this opportunity just became a siege situation and not a quick play.

If you add to your DD ""pick how much money you are willing to spend and sell the put that directly correlates to that amount"" that would be great.

“ Tax Reporting

The Internal Revenue Service requires you to declare your capital gain as soon as the stock becomes ""substantially worthless."" Your capital gain is short term -- taxed at your marginal rate -- since you never owned the stock. If the stock price has dropped to a few pennies per share as the year ends, you might want to recognize the gain before the new year, even if the firm is not yet formally bankrupt -- you don't want the good folks at the IRS accusing you of delaying payment of your taxes. You report the gain on IRS Form 8949 as if you had covered the short sale at a price of zero. You also report the gain on Schedule D and on Form 1040 or one of its variants.”

712,NET," RETARD ALERT

jesus christ, there are a lot of retards in here that don't understand wash sales, and think that this guy lost 46k. All a wash sale is doing is preventing you from selling for a loss, and then repurchasing those same shares again at essentially the same price, and then deducting the loss yet riding the share price back up at the same time. Sounds fun doesn't it? That's why it's illegal and the entire point of the rule.

It technically is added to your cost basis if you repurchase in 30 days, but in simple terms, you are taxed on your net gains, or can deduct your net losses; just fucking ignore the wash sale values. The only thing that can really happen is if you sell for a loss in late December and buy back in Jan within 30 days, which will cause a deferred loss that you can't deduct until the end of the year. But if you're really that strapped for cash that you can't wait to deduct it next year, you really shouldn't be actively trading.

TL;DR wash sales have no effect 99% of the time, and you are taxed on NET GAINS, or can deduct NET LOSSES.",FoldyFlap,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/llvf0j/800k_in_short_term_trades_totaled_for_the_year/gnt8r0q/,0.143,0.779,0.079,-0.9157

Somehow their market cap is now higher than at any time during 2019, so the stock is fundamentally overpriced.

> seeing all these posts misusing data / confirmation bias to ""prove"" a financial conspiracy theory.

I think there are many legitimate questions that have gone unanswered around the entire GME ordeal. People are asking questions precisely because the data does not tell a clear story. People are also asking questions because there is reasonable evidence to suggest that a financial conspiracy did occur when buy-side was restricted. You seem like smart guy who reads the financial press, and so I know you are aware of the fact that financial conspiracies happen all the time. Let's not bandy the term 'conspiracy' around as a pejorative when historical data suggests it's a normal occurrence as far as finance capital is concerned. Is this the case with GME (ie. conspiracy)? Well the absolute hard evidence is yet to be proven, but the question is reasonable at the present time.

If you are now making the argument that people are misusing data to ""prove"" (your terms) a financial conspiracy (they do happen, right?) then it's important that you cite these examples. I say this because most reasonable posts point to FTDs and other suspicious data looking for answers that no one has yet provided. From their vantage point, GME was about to seriously pop and inflict MAJOR damage until buy-side was restricted.

With that said, I have the opposite question in mind:

what does your analysis of the data ""prove""?

Considering that you've decided to generously give about an hour of your time (in your own estimate) putting this analysis together (presumably for the benefit of others), it seems imperative that you address [this question](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/llmiu1/dddd_was_gme_being_illegally_naked_short_sold/gnqysvv/) – and maybe you're getting to that.",darkside_of_the_tomb,8,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/llmiu1/dddd_was_gme_being_illegally_naked_short_sold/gnryp1b/,0.111,0.832,0.057,-0.9347
822,AMC," Not sure if you saw, but I already replied to that specific comment. It doesn't really prove anything other than it doesn't seem like anything super-fishy is going on with FTDs. Could there be some shady shit going on? Sure. Although, imo wsb is going in the complete wrong direction here.

If there is a conspiracy theory, or at very least fraud or misaligned incentives, it's with clearing houses. Central clearing houses like DTCC basically shows that they can unilaterally effectively halt buying of any ticker for whatever reason. The justification for this is risk management - i.e. because they need to insure all the transactions in the market against counterparty risk, and the risk of trading GME just skyrocketed, they needed to increase collateral. You can take it one step further and say that many institutions, especially hedge funds which take 10x leverage, could quickly become insolvent if their short on GME, AMC, etc. went badly as those tickers skyrocketed. A wave of institutions collapsing is a systematic risk to the clearing houses and might make them go under, causing the financial system to basically collapse. In effect, this could have made these institutions ""too big to fail"" from a central clearing house's perspective, so their incentives is aligned with those institutions in ensuring their solvency, and hence  having GME not moon.

824,OR," Yeah agreed, you can't blindly make either assumption that

""there seems to be an increase in car accidents on thanksgiving, but we can rule out an increase in drunk driving rates as the cause because there was just a lot of traffic today""

OR

""there seems to be an increase in car accidents on thanksgiving, must be because there's an increase in drunk driving rates""

What you need to do to interpret data in that case is look at the number of drunk driving accidents, normalized (i.e. divided by) traffic. In other words, drunk driving incidents vs. number of drivers on the road. It usually isn't straight forward / linear as that, and maybe traffic itself might be a contributing factor (eg. more traffic can itself be a cause of accidents), but its a much more useful info than only looking at the raw number of drunk driving accidents",ASoftEngStudent,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/llmiu1/dddd_was_gme_being_illegally_naked_short_sold/gnt3mm3/,0.161,0.711,0.128,-0.8276

You were hoping it hit $100 after that report comes in March, but if hit 4x that before, the play changes to sell then. 

If you are watching football and a team gets the ball at their own 20, the plan is to put together a good drive and get into FG range and if it goes well, score a TD. But if your running back hits the open field on the first play you rather he takes it 80 yards to the endzone. Plans should change when circumstances change. The point of investing/trading is to make profit and the best profit was the spike. If you thought it was a good $100/share play, then why the fuck wouldn't you unload at $400/share?

879,IMO," HIndsight is 20/20, anyone who took profit at the top did so out of pure luck and good intuition. Absolutely it was the right move, just as getting back in now is also going to turn out to be the right move. 

If you know you have a good team with a solid game plan you don't just give up because they don't score in the second quarter. They may have blown a lot of their luck on that first Hail Mary but unless you have reason to think you were wrong in the first place you should at least stick through with them until the end of the game. 

Not sure if that metaphor made sense to you so I'll put it in more precise language: The original market thesis was that they would be worth 100 by March. Has anything changed to disprove that thesis? Since nothing fundamentally has actually happened yet the original thesis is still valid. Speculation and hype creates bubbles and that's exactly what happened. If anything the original thesis is even more valid now that they've shaken some shorts off their backs. The infinity squeeze would have been nice but the ogs weren't in this because of that. 100 is still a 100% gain from where it is now, and that is my pessimistic target.

If GameStonk does nothing post ER and Ryan Cohen/Reggie Fils-Aime remain silent after the media blackout period: I promise to get a tattoo of a tombstone labeled ""GME RIP"" because then I will have been proven wrong.

IMO they have been silent through all of this because they are confident in their game plan. If they were desperate then a share offering or media statement would have been made.

Reason they let you buy options is because they knew most people would be buying calls and would lose money.

892,GME," Oh yes, I agree with this. They effectively used Federal Reserve type monetary policy to disincentivize buy side demand. If it is true that the FTDs were starting to stack up that would be a rather interesting thing, since the DTCC is the back stop for all trades occurring in the US markets. Which actually incentivizes them to implement policy to keep themselves from being bankrupt or having solvency issues.

I think the GME trade may have actually caused the markets to blow up. In that as the price of GME mooned, hedgies would have been margin called, leading to their long positions being dumped on the market. This loss in value of various long positions would have caused some long only funds to start getting margin called, which when that happened we would have seen a chain reaction of explosions in a lot of the funds possibly even Fidelity, Blackrock and Vanguard. The most interesting thing about this situation is as GME mooned and good stocks crashed, GME and other meme stock holders would have been in cash, which would have been a huge transference of wealth across the markets.

More interestingly though is the fact that with the sell side bias on trading, is the amount of options that went OTM. This would have forced so many shares to be short that theoretically we could have seen 30 to 40 million FTDs on a single stock after that day. Which would have been rather interesting when those came due.

904,ON," TESTIMONY OF KEITH PATRICK GILL
BEFORE THE U.S. HOUSE COMMITTEE ON FINANCIAL SERVICES
Thank you Chairwoman Waters, Ranking Member McHenry, members of the Committee.
Before I go further, I want to be clear about what I am not. I am not a hedge fund. I do
not have clients, and I do not provide personalized investment advice for fees or commissions. I
am an individual investor. My investment in GameStop and my posts on social media were
entirely my own.
I did not solicit anyone to buy or sell the stock for my own profit. I did not belong to any
groups trying to create movements in the stock price. I never had a financial relationship with any
hedge fund. I had no information about GameStop except what was public. I did not know any
people inside the company, and I never spoke to any insider.
As an individual investor, I use publicly available information to study the market and the
value of specific companies. I consider a complex array of factors and track hundreds of stocks –
all in search of market inefficiencies. Like many people, sometimes I post on social media my
thoughts and analysis about individual stocks and whether they are correctly valued.
I did that with GameStop. I believed the company was dramatically undervalued by the
market. The prevailing analysis about GameStop’s impending doom was simply wrong.
A little about my background: I grew up in Brockton, Massachusetts. My father was a
truck driver, and my mom a registered nurse. I was one of three kids, and the first in my family to
earn a four-year college degree when I graduated from Stonehill College in 2009, amid the Great
Recession and without a long-term job. My first post-college job was in operations at W.B. Mason,
an office supplies company headquartered in my home town of Brockton.

1

 Between 2010 and 2014, I worked for a family friend at a start-up company in New
Hampshire, trying to build a software program that would help investors analyze stocks and offer
related research. We also tried to start an investment firm, which dissolved not long after it was
created. My salary never exceeded $40,000, but I did learn something about investing. I learned
how to do the tedious work of digging through a company’s financials and focusing on its real
long-term value, not prevailing market sentiment or headlines.
I married my wife Caroline in 2016, and I found a job working operations and compliance
at LexShares. I left that job in March 2017, and for the next two years I was effectively without a
job. During that time, I began actively analyzing a wide array of stocks to try to keep and increase
our limited savings. It was both a way to make money and an interest that I pursued passionately
while I lacked a job.
In April 2019, I accepted a marketing and financial education job at MassMutual. Caroline
and I were both happy about our prospects. I had never made a salary over $100,000 a year before,
and I was thrilled just to be working and to have benefits again. My title was Director, Financial
Wellness Education. My job was to help develop financial education classes that advisors could
present to prospective clients. I never sold securities, and I was not a financial advisor.
I continued analyzing stocks on my own time and investing my family’s funds. In early
June of 2019, the price of GameStop’s stock declined on worse than expected earnings, and it
began trading at a deep discount, below what I thought was its fair value. I was aware from public
reports that a well-known investor, Michael Burry, was interested in GameStop. Because I thought
the stock was undervalued, I purchased call options on June 7, 2019. I increased my position
throughout much of 2019 and 2020, because as I continued to analyze the company and its

2

 prospects, I became increasingly confident that the share price was indeed dramatically
undervalued.
Two important factors, based entirely on publicly available information, gave me and many
others confidence that GameStop was undervalued in 2019 and 2020. First, the market was
underestimating the prospects of GameStop’s legacy business and overestimating the likelihood
of its going bankrupt. GameStop, the only major retailer dedicated to gaming, has over 60 million
members in its loyalty program and continues to maintain a sizable market share within the gaming
industry. Its legacy business, comprised primarily of selling physical video games and related
equipment within their stores, was likely to generate meaningful cash flow following the release
of new gaming consoles in late 2020. I grew up playing videogames and shopping at GameStop,
and I’m looking forward to buying a new console at GameStop. I knew the company had an
opportunity to reinvigorate this business by improving customer service for gamers, upgrading its
online presence, and offering complementary product lines such as PC gaming and accessories.
Second, I believed – and I continue to believe – that GameStop has the potential to reinvent
itself as the ultimate destination for gamers within the thriving $200 billion gaming industry. The
new console cycle provides GameStop a unique opportunity to pivot from a traditionally brickand-mortar mindset toward a technology-driven business that excels in gaming products,
experiences and services. By embracing the digital economy, GameStop can pursue new revenues
streams including larger gaming catalogs, digital content and community experiences, online
trade-ins, streaming services, and Esports. While I may be the only panelist here today who had
faith in GameStop, I was hardly the only person who advocated these points or ones like them.
Investors including Chewy co-founder Ryan Cohen, whose purchase of GameStop shares and

3

 advocacy with the GameStop board helped positively affect the share price in late 2020, publicly
expressed similar views.
I want to pause to note that the investment I made was risky, but I was confident in my
analysis, and I was willing to accept the loss if I was proven wrong. My timing was far from
perfect, and many of the options contracts I purchased expired worthless because GameStop’s
stock price remained depressed longer than I expected.
I’ve been asked why I decided to share my investment ideas on social media. My
investment skills had reached a level where I felt sharing them publicly could help others. I also
thought that by sharing my own ideas and accepting critiques, I would be able to identify holes in
my analysis. Hedge funds and other Wall Street firms have teams of analysts working together to
compile research and critique investment ideas, while individual investors have not had that
advantage. Social media platforms like YouTube, Twitter, and WallStreetBets on Reddit are
leveling the playing field. And in a year of quarantines and COVID, engaging with other investors
on social media was a safe way to socialize. We had fun.
The idea that I used social media to promote GameStop stock to unwitting investors is
preposterous. I was abundantly clear that my channel was for educational purposes only, and that
my aggressive style of investing was unlikely to be suitable for most folks checking out the
channel. Whether other individual investors bought the stock was irrelevant to my thesis – my
focus was on the fundamentals of the business. It’s worth noting that after five months of
streaming, my final stream of 2020 topped out at just ninety-six concurrent viewers, with an
average view duration of twenty-five minutes. On Christmas morning I had only 529 subscribers
on YouTube, and 550 followers on Twitter. These numbers are tiny. There were rarely more than
a few dozen folks on the stream on any night. The reality was people didn’t really care about

4

 boring, repetitive analysis of GameStop and other stocks, and that was fine. For those of us who
did care, the stream provided us an outlet for refining our fundamentals-based thesis. We were
able to analyze events in real-time and keep each other honest.
Ultimately my GameStop investment was a success. But the thing is, I felt that way in
December far before the peak, when the stock was at $20 a share. I was so happy to visit my
family in Brockton for the holidays and give them the great news – we were millionaires. That
money will go such a long way for my family. We had an incredibly difficult 2020. In addition
to dealing with COVID, we lost my sister Sara unexpectedly in June. It brought me tremendous
joy to share good news with my family for a change. I am grateful to be able to give back to my
community and to support my family, most of all my wife Caroline who has stuck with me through
very tough times.
As for what happened in January, others will have to explain it.

Threshold lists, order

flow, halting purchases – according to the media these all had a material impact on GameStop
stock in January. Here’s the thing: I’ve had a bit of experience and even I barely understand these
matters. It’s alarming how little we know about the inner-workings of the market, and I am
thankful that this Committee is examining what happened. I believe an analysis of GameStop’s
recent price action must start with a discussion of the exorbitant short interest in the stock, as well
as an investigation into any potentially manipulative shorting practices and brokers’ reported
failures to timely deliver shares and settle trades.
As for what I expect moving forward: GameStop’s stock price may have gotten a bit ahead
of itself last month, but I’m as bullish as I’ve ever been on a potential turnaround. In short, I like
the stock. And what’s stunning is that, as far as I can tell, the market remains oblivious to
GameStop’s unique opportunity within the gaming industry.

The man deserves every penny he made off Gamestop and probably more with all the sketchy actions that took place to halt its progress.  DFV actually believed in the stock, for WAY longer than most people on WSB who bought in for the short squeeze. 

Maybe take a little more of a look at the hedgefunds trying to short the stock into its grave and brokerages straight up removing the ability to buy while leaving the ability to sell.

1095,GME," They gave an example of one post here but they are probably overemphasizing the role of WSB in the general social media chatter about silver among retail investors. There is more to that general phenomenon than just WSB.

At that time there was a lot of ""the media is colluding with the hedge funds to try to distract us from the second GME squeeze which is coming any time now"" which was more fake most of the stuff in the news.

The DXCM sensor is applied by the user, using an automated applicator that deploys the sensor at the correct depth in a fraction of a second with minimal pain and is then discarded (DXCM does have some issues with deployment, which are extremely unpleasant but seems to be relatively isolated so far). The Senseonics sensor is literally stabbed into the user by a trained medical professional using a tuning fork looking thing (they actually had to put somebody under general anesthetic and do surgery to remove a sensor in a clinical trial: [https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh\_docs/pdf16/P160048B.pdf](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/pdf16/P160048B.pdf)). They also left pieces of the sensor behind during explantation of the sensor during that same study. 

Another point to consider here is that the only reason they are using their fluorescent technology is because they need to avoid stepping on DXCM's patents. They could use this technology to invert the signal with respect to glucose so that they are more accurate in hypo range, but that would infringe on someone else's patent (Metronom, a small pre revenue startup). They missed 20% of the hypogycemic events in their clinical, which isn't great. From a MARD/accuracy perspective they are also much much worse than DXCM (13% vs <10%).

1159,TNDM," A lot of this dd is about making things easier for us. But, everything you described about appointments, insurance, procedures really undermines that point. I think non t1s don't recognize that changing a sensor every 10 days (heck i can usually get 17 days out of mine) isn't that big of a deal compared to all the other hour-by-hour management responsibilities. 

Compounding that point, my TNDM DXCM integration with control iq *is* the sort of thing that significantly improves my qol. Giving that up and having more finger sticks? No thanks. 

One place that it may do okay is in the type II market?

1201,ES," Depends on the Lexus. 

My friend has a lexus and is 24. It's from 1997 and is probably not worth even $1k on resale.

That said most luxury cars actually come pretty cheap on resale(You'd be surprised at what you can get a $60k luxury car from 2 years ago on the used market today) and Lexus' actually have pretty low and infrequent maintenance costs since they're effectively just nicer Toyotas.

You can get a used 2018 ES for 25k for example and could probably get one from 2010-2014 in the low 10's. Pretty affordable for a 23 year old who is even decently well off(And even assuming he started with 5k at 22 we can assume he's doing decently for his age)",Nafemp,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lldn9m/100k_pltr_and_crsr_yolo_update_im_in_my_mid_20s/gnq7yl2/,0.043,0.79,0.167,0.9496

1207,MS," As Papa Karp said today if you are looking for quick gains get the fuck out, this is a 💎🖐 play. All the analysts from MS, Goldman and Jeffries said the earnings were great. Palantards should know the loss is due to stock based compensation related to the DPO, which are gone by the next earnings report. If they are ignored palantir should have had an EPS of 0.06 which ia 300% surprise from the expectations. It is still a great investment. In the long term it doesn't matter you got in at 25 or 35. They said themselves they expect minimum revenues 4bil by 2025 that's 400% from where we are today. That's minimum 100% averaged per year, fuck the haters and the 🐻🏳️‍🌈.

A fuel bundle is placed into service and is in the reactor for ~3 cycles (a cycle is anywhere from 12, 18, or 24 months). After that, the ""used"" bundles are removed from service and placed in a spent fuel pool where they sit, on average, 6-10 years. At a set time they take the used bundles and place them into a large ""cask"" which is then either welded or bolted and placed outside, on company property, where it sits indefinitely. Now, this is very general. A lot of plants do things just a bit differently. Some plants place the casks in underground areas where others keep them outside.

 I wonder of the people who lost cause of the shorts can get in on this, it would at least be dramatic to see in-class people making the same ""stonks manipulation"" from the low and high peaks. 

  Someone with enough money to get past the paypall posted that the plaintiff sold options at 100 and then got called.

Mass Mutual is not going to be happy, that's for sure.  The license term violations will probably have to do with performing a licensed function (investment advice) without disclosing that relationship.  Basically he went rogue.

1441,DD," So a few uranium DD posts rising in a short time. This seems a bit sus. Anyway, I have long held the belief that nuclear is the way out of this mess and we need to ignore the general publics uninformed opinion.

From SMRs to Thorium reactors there's a lot of activity going on to develop these technologies..... But they are not ready yet. 

Gates has been working on one and investing in the sector. He feels they have developed a reasonable design (you can watch the Gates Netflix Documentary for more info). The US gov wasn't ready for it, China was interested in building a pilot plant as they are scaling up nuclear power. Yet politics between US and China stopped any progress.

NUCLEAR IS maybe THE FUTURE! Until fusion power comes along (looks back at that 40yr old 20yr timeframe) however do not underestimate politics. Nuclear is a hot potato with the public that most western govs don't want to touch. Grid level energy storage systems could beat a nuclear revolution down if they are cost effective enough.

IMHO until the general publics sentiment towards nuclear changes we won't see progress soon. For sentiment to change we will need to see extraordinary proof from these new reactor designs. This is still a way off unfortunately. Also from all my reading on uranium mining (very brief) there's currently no shortage in the supply of uranium and because of it's energy density, there may never be.",Schweeppes,7,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lljwet/is_uranium_the_future_of_clean_energy/gnrcvg7/,0.076,0.856,0.068,0.1187

1443,AC," I mean, discussing the issue with a plasma physicist and another student that worked with her on plasma, I can safely say that the issue with plasma comes from the fact that the amount of energy to heat the damn stuff yields less energy than it costs. At least, that's with fusion. It's going to take a lot of research in the field to get there, or one really lucky breakthrough lol.

Sidenote: we still ended up using Tesla's AC. Between AC and DC, AC is way cheaper for long range power systems. Unless you plan on having a generator per household, that is. Even then, those generators will 99.9% likely produce AC that has to be changed back.

Intel should be required to divest itself entirely from China to see a single cent.

It's not like Intel's short of money and that's why they've sucked so much recently but if they had money they'd have done better. This money won't change a damn thing, and even if it were to, it'll take years for them to right that ship. It's nothing other than cash for the boys.

Finally, you should all be aware that OP is an employee for Intel seeing as they failed to mention that, as you can see from his post history.

Disclaimer: I am long AMD - I like that stock.

Edit: everyone should read this utter shit show of a post where they were shilling earlier. The OP doesn't have a clue what they're talking about despite claiming he works in a fab.

1781,DD," Awww fuck. My Ford play is fucked, it showed up on WSB. Time to sell. 

Jokes aside, this DD is not great. It’s a riskier play than this DD makes clear, with a higher potential profit. In short, the perfect WSB gamble. 

Here’s the bull: ef150. Replacing the postal service fleet. 

The ef150 is an inevitability. And it’s going to blow the fucking doors open. No fleet is gonna want to buy cyber trucks. But plenty of local fleets that run regular f150s and put 100-200 miles on them every day will fucking kill to get an electric truck with lower upkeep they can charge over night. The demand is there already for this truck. The supply is what’s missing. And that’ll spread to the general consumer once they see how rad the power train is and how amazing the torque is with these trucks. The added fuel savings are just a bonus, the real benefit is how fucking amazing the electric powertrain is going to be. Speaking as a recent Tesla owner, electric is the present and future, and anybody who doesn’t have electric versions of their cars is missing the boat. The ef150 is going to be the most revolutionary EV since Tesla produced the model s and the model 3. They literally print money with the f150, and that won’t change with the switch to electric. 

The second big one is the postal service fleet. In March, the USPS is expected to make its final decision (although that could be delayed) on what it chooses to replace its aging fleet. The options have been narrowed down from over 60 bids to three potential finalists. One is a shithouse company called workhorse, that has produced something like 6500 total vehicles, and has a history of over promising and under delivering with a shady ceo. The demo cars they sent to be tested by the usps had to be canceled because they were having failures with important systems like “the brakes” and hospitalizing usps test drivers. Somehow they’re still in the running. The next brand is a Turkish hybrid company. This has some potential. Finally, there is a joint bid between F and OSK to use transit vans. The initial bid was for diesel vans, but Ford and Oshkosh have already stated they’re ready to proceed with an electric version of the usps would prefer that. This contract is worth 6.5 billion. F and OSK have a pretty solid chance of securing this contract on their own, and while the usps is in charge of their own decisions due to the way the board of governors operates, Biden can absolutely put pressure on them if he has a certain preference. You know who wants to promote US made EVs? Biden. You know who wants to produce US made EVs? F/OSK. 

Finally, the dems seem to be reviving hopes of a further EV tax credit of $7,000 for the first 400,000 EVs sold which would be a big deal. 

Things are looking good for Ford. 



Except: 

Here’s the bear:

Batteries. Fords plan for the battery they were going to use in the ef150 came from a South Korean competitor of LG. You know who just got slapped with a 10 year import ban for stealing trade secrets from LG? The same battery maker. There’s already an allowance for them to continue with plans to make a factory in the US and make batteries for F for 4 years, but they’ve said that the cost of that factory would take more than 4 years to pay off. Biden can intervene, or the case can go to the Supreme Court, but without this decision getting overturned, this is a major setback for the ef150 (and coincidentally vw’s plans to build the ID4 in the US). There is precedent for presidents overturning these decisions in the name of state manufacturing security, and the last president to do it was Obama, but currently as things stand, this isn’t great news for Ford. 

Additionally, Ford has already announced their production is going to be limited by shortages in semiconductors this year. Even if Biden pushes help towards the semiconductor industry, it still takes time to ramp up production and it’s not like TSM can just produce more chips, they’re already at max capacity. 

Basically, If a bunch of things go right for Ford, it’s going to fucking kill it. But it’s risky, because all of those things need to go in Fords favor and there’s a lot of room for shit to go sideways. I recently closed about 90% of my position in Ford because of this. 

Position: 100 shares, 15 1/21/22 $12 calls. 

It’s a gamble. If Biden overturns this battery decision (quite possible, since he’s been pushing US made EVs and Ford and VW are the two big mfgs that can actually make that happen besides Tesla, and there is historical precedent from an administration he was a part of), things will look much better. If Ford can get ahold of chips, it’ll look even better. If they get this usps contract, holy shit. If the dems pass a further 7,000 tax credit for up to 400,000 EVs sold, holy fucking shit that’s gonna be great for Ford. But there are a lot of “ifs” on this one.

QS is a great addition for longer term value in the stock, but they don't even plan to be delivering engineering samples of their batteries till 2023 which means big money sink until then. But you are right about the market share in Europe. I think they are going to get shafted in North America though. Even that SK ruling gave Ford 4 years and only 2 to VW.

Hi ,

 
Thanks for reaching out!

We can only guarantee that your tax documents will be available in your app by February 16th. There is a possibility that you will receive them sooner, though! 

 
Additionally, following your asset transfer, any remaining assets or dividends that you receive in your Robinhood brokerage account will be transferred to your other brokerage through the residual sweep process.

 
You can expect those assets to be delivered in about 5 to 7 trading days.

 
If you have any other questions, let me know. I’m here to help.",Iloveottermemes,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/llfbmw/did_you_guys_not_robinhood_users_get_their_1099/gnpel56/,0.014,0.837,0.15,0.9583

So I ended up holding hoping that the company will get it together or there's another squeeze. It was bet money though, I lost way more on options that missed by a few pennies.... Lol

EDIT: Just to clarify, I had emergency surgery on the day GME exploded. I bought stock and options, then couldn't sell because I was in surgery, lol.

EDIT2: Since I can't respond and apparently I need to say it because this was somehow believable...? I'm making jokes, these are jokes. All that's happening is a bunch of degenerates are repositioning from when they bought really high and apparently someone was convinced GME is getting unlisted or something, lol.",apianti,-1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lm0as2/there_are_200k_gme_shares_bid_at_00001_driving/gnsvato/,0.103,0.777,0.121,0.5499

1855,GME," Hahahhahhah no way. This explains why there are all of these sell limit restrictions being placed on GME right now. TDA won't let you go higher than $250/$300. 

Huh. I wondered why other platforms were suddenly jumping on the restrictions train when they had previously allowed unlimited sell limits. TDA has had these in place since the end of January, but RH and others only recently started putting restrictions on sell limits.

1864,BB," Nothing has changed fundamentally for BB it still posts good news (almost daily). Im holding until John Chen himself says they missed major targets or lost a substantial partnership. I try not to check its price as BB is still in the growth stages of its new business. If successful BB could be worth 100s of billions, with sale/subscriptions in the billions. I will reassess my position after every earnings from now till basically forever.",Saintcephus,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/llzb67/almost_10k_loss_am_i_doing_this_right/gnsjngi/,0.055,0.788,0.158,0.8176
