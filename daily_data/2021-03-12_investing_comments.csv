10,DD,"  Pekka is doing now what should have been done a few years back. Unfortunately Nokia have lost some momentum because Raji Suri, the former CEO, failed at integrating Alcatel-Lucent into the wider Nokia ecosystem. The whole process consumed Nokia internally and diverted focus from cost optimization and investments required to ride the 5G wave.

What is completely missing from this DD is any mention of Ericsson, which I believe is Nokia's main competition. Ericsson have had a very succesfull company turn around, but they started the process in 2017 when Borje Ekholm took over as CEO and by the end of 2019 they were in a much better position than Nokia to capitalize on the 5G cycle. They have sound financials, a good product & services line-up and have already gone through the painful cost cutting measures.

I do hope that Nokia keeps its track record of reinventing itself, -remember it started as a toilet paper producing company, but the competition is dire and they need to have a swift, no frills company transformation.",ByteTrader,11,/r/investing/comments/m33vsq/full_diligence_post_on_nokia_nok_ahead_of_capital/gqo2xzv/,0.105,0.815,0.079,-0.4398

The roaring 20s was supported by industrial progress and adoption of new technologies that massively increased productivity, do we have anything on that scale now ?

72,AI," Covid mostly accelerated e-commerce and some areas of fintech. I am not sure that the productivity increases from these will be that big.  Videoconferencing has improved as well. This will increase remote work but the productivity gains from that could be small.

The largest potential productivity increases that I can see this coming decade are from IoT and robotics (namely industrial cobots) but they are more likely to make a serious impact after 2025. They are in early stage now since they rely to a large extent on having a mature 5G network deployed.

During the next few years we'll have some increases from personal assistants and smart(er) chatbots and especially from RPA (robotic process automation), which unfortunately will generate an unemployment problem in some sectors.

Big data analytics and ML have more productivity potential but they are still at the beginning, so I would expect  most major gains after 2025.

Now the increase in income due to increased productivity ends up largely captured at the top with the c-suite executives.  Wages haven't kept up with increased productivity since the early 70s.

Secondly, we may be on the verge of widespread job losses due to AI and robotics replacing everything from warehouse to factory to white collar office workers.  And those that don't lose their job will be paid less just to sit as backup to their non-breathing replacements.

I agree that wages haven’t increased in relation to productivity increases and that’s definitely a huge issue but my hope is we can continue to bring in increasingly progressive administrations that can help make those two converge a bit more. 

While wages haven’t increased, corporate profits have, so anyone invested in the stock market has done well. Ideally we have a situation where people can use UBI to invest in innovative companies and solutions and all of the necessities (and even some comforts) are met. I don’t think us workers need to own the means of production in a very socialist sense really, but using UBI to get a piece of the pie seems pretty dope.

Sometimes if you work in high tech fields (AI, IT, robotics) you are tempted to imagine that all companies are as advanced as what you see internally within your specialist circle.

If you sell the house in this case, aren't you out 100k? You owe 290k, the house is worth 200k, 290k - 200k = 90k. Add in your 10k down payment and you're out a total 100k (the loss of value in the home).

Same thing here. You owe 80k, the house is worth 200k, 80k - 200k = -120k, so it looks like you're up 120k, but you've already paid 220k. 220k - 120k = 100k. Once again, you're out a total of 100k.

90,EAF," Macro economics and politics matter more than valuations in EM, but don't write them off just due to political risk.

With valuations so high around the world, there really aren't any safe bets anymore. You are taking another type of risk by being entirely in developed market equities. 

A bet on EM is simply a bet that things will ""get better"" rather than get worse. If China can slowly grow to be 20% less crooked than they are today, then financial markets should reward them with higher multiples.

If you are okay with taking on the risk of investing in EM, here are some options besides a market index:

- DGS: One of the two EM ETFs I hold. It holds small companies only, so hopefully less political risk, and screens/weighs by dividends, because unlike financial statements you cannot easily fake a dividend. 

- AVEM: A relatively new ETF from Avantis that holds a smaller universe than VWO, with tilting towards quality/fundamentals.. without making big sector bets. Yes, fundamentals in EM can be cooked, but IMO this ETF will lean away from market bubbles that are common in that sphere. The team managing this ETF has a pretty good pedigree. 

- Actively managed funds: Vanguard has a good active fund. T Rowe does as well but I believe theirs is closed to new money. My advice is to pick a fund that checks these marks: fee under 1%, low turnover, less than 500 stocks, manager has skin in the game (you can verify via Morningstar), and I would avoid anything that leans too heavily towards growth/tech. All the above matter more than recent performance. 

For the record, I am heavily invested in EM but I also hold $1 in conflict hedge for every $5 of China exposure..so I am loaded up on LMT, NOC, LHX, and EAF. If China ever attacks Taiwan all global markets will crash anyway though, not just EM.

Edit: the reason to not hold the full index and instead hold a smaller universe...is because IMO successfully investing in EM is more about what you *don't* hold rather than what you hold. VWO is forced to hold every single Hong Kong listed stock, and I'd rather have a screen for fraud/bs/shenanigans. You can achieve that screen by using an active fund or an ETF that screens on dividends (DGS) or quality (AVEM).",cr0ne,121,/r/investing/comments/m339dm/emerging_markets_and_index_investing/gqmx055/,0.092,0.785,0.123,0.9378

For the record, I am heavily invested in EM but I also hold $1 in conflict hedge for every $5 of China exposure..so I am loaded up on LMT, NOC, LHX, and EAF. If China ever attacks Taiwan all global markets will crash anyway though, not just EM.

Edit: the reason to not hold the full index and instead hold a smaller universe...is because IMO successfully investing in EM is more about what you *don't* hold rather than what you hold. VWO is forced to hold every single Hong Kong listed stock, and I'd rather have a screen for fraud/bs/shenanigans. You can achieve that screen by using an active fund or an ETF that screens on dividends (DGS) or quality (AVEM).",cr0ne,121,/r/investing/comments/m339dm/emerging_markets_and_index_investing/gqmx055/,0.092,0.785,0.123,0.9378
92,LHX," Macro economics and politics matter more than valuations in EM, but don't write them off just due to political risk.

With valuations so high around the world, there really aren't any safe bets anymore. You are taking another type of risk by being entirely in developed market equities. 

A bet on EM is simply a bet that things will ""get better"" rather than get worse. If China can slowly grow to be 20% less crooked than they are today, then financial markets should reward them with higher multiples.

If you are okay with taking on the risk of investing in EM, here are some options besides a market index:

- DGS: One of the two EM ETFs I hold. It holds small companies only, so hopefully less political risk, and screens/weighs by dividends, because unlike financial statements you cannot easily fake a dividend. 

- AVEM: A relatively new ETF from Avantis that holds a smaller universe than VWO, with tilting towards quality/fundamentals.. without making big sector bets. Yes, fundamentals in EM can be cooked, but IMO this ETF will lean away from market bubbles that are common in that sphere. The team managing this ETF has a pretty good pedigree.

113,IMO," Look at the 'People' section on the fund in question. It shows all the managers and how much they are holding.

Special note on multi-management house funds, such as Vanguard's EM fund. These type of funds are managed by 2, 3 or sometimes more independent management houses..with each having some share of capital. You'll rarely see managers have skin in those funds, but that doesn't mean the managers aren't invested.. 

What you'll see instead is those managers tend to also run a smaller boutique ""house"" fund belonging solely to their company..and they'll generally have skin in that fund instead, with similar holdings. So they still have skin in their holdings, just not in the mixed fund. Multi-management funds tends to be a mix of the styles from those different groups. 

YMMV, there's pros and cons to multi management funds. It can sometimes be a shady way to deal with a bad performaning fund...i.e. if a fund is performing bad, it can get rolled into an existing fund so the fund shop can erase the bad performance history. 

Vanguard IMO is one of the more trustworthy players of the multi management game. I don't think I'd ever consider a multi-team fund that wasn't from them.",cr0ne,2,/r/investing/comments/m339dm/emerging_markets_and_index_investing/gqpktxw/,0.067,0.892,0.041,-0.8157

I don't actually think this is true. The theory is based on efficient market which isn't true and doesn't take into account differences in risk appetite. 90% of the volume are pension/institutionals that have to stay with blue chip for risk tolerance. Many of the financial products or strategies available to an individual retail investor are too risky for these funds to try, but can have much higher risk/reward profiles.

Look around on reddit, there are many people who slam not % gains yearly but x gains. Imagine if you only try to make a few trades a year but ones with high conviction and high risk/reward.

If you think that everyone eventually reverts to the mean and can't beat the market, then you should think that these two averages are the same.  If that is the case, it is not rational to trade in the short term either, since you're just as likely to start with a string of losses as you are a string of wins,

Apologies but this is all horse shit? Reverting to the mean in the long term means there is significant room for outperform in the short term. It's supported here in a study, it's supported by pics of big gains all over reddit, and it's supposedly warren buffet himself. 

You are wrong. You CAN beat the market in the short term which is all anyone needs to do to gap themselves up, and your chances are higher with a lower volume of trades:

https://ragingbull.com/kb/how-to-make-money-with-penny-stocks/

Pennystocks can be a way to multiply your money but you can also lose it all. You should only put a small percentage of your portfolio on these cheap stocks .

Otcmarkets.com you can see pennystocks that are being sold ,  up to date news by ticker + screener. Some stocks have warnings. 

Unbiastock.com shows you stocks that are trading last hour or 6-12-24.

Finviz.com is a stock screener with many filters but only non-OTC .

My stock portfolio is a free app to monitor your portfolio .

You can also request email alerts from the ARK website with their daily trades of their extremely popular ETFs.

TD Ameritrade lets you buy almost any stock.  RH and Webull don't allow OTC and most pennystocks are OTC. Fidelity also good but occasionally don't offer a stock. 

I trade 4-5 stocks daily but that is cuz I'm on my phone most of the day monitoring my 64 stock portfolio and seeing what others recommend or what is selling .

The general advice for pennystocks is to trade not invest . Occasionally you find a winner that you keep and might add to your holds. You make more money with several 20% short trades that add up over time vs chasing winners and losing money in the process. 

We all make the mistake of getting in late, or selling too early . 

I don't do what some do like deeply research a company Sec filings , balance sheet etc. 

I go to Yahoo Finance free app and click View All. Check 50/200 MA + Float: ideally under 100M or much smaller.  Ideally the numbers at the bottom like earnings growth,  operating income,  EBITDA should be positive but rarely the case with pennystocks or companies that are growing. 

Billions of shares in a pennystock is a warning sign of a pump and dump, so is a price graph that has straight lines up, down and horizontal instead of the standard gradual curve .

Before a purchase I check Yahoo Finance conversations. You can see how much interest by number of new conversations.  Also good info from posters that know about the company.  Volume too is important.  Should be much higher than usual.

I also go to Stocktwits for the same .

Someone pointed out that companies that price rises 100% in last year or months will probably keep going . This is very true in pennystocks. 

But these sites + Reddit are full of pumpers and dumpers.  So read through the lines.

Finally when a stock seems a winner by the point it crosses 100% for you many recoup investment.  I wait until 220-240% so I only have to sell 30% of stocks not 50%. This threshold usually happens in one day. A stock goes up gradually for days or weeks then suddenly flies. 

If you are using RH or WB that don't allow pennystocks there is a subreddit r/RobinHoodPennyStocks .
On NASDAQ many options like CTRM + SNDL + DGLY + HIMX + CIDM + NOK + ATOM+ ENG

Billions of shares in a pennystock is a warning sign of a pump and dump, so is a price graph that has straight lines up, down and horizontal instead of the standard gradual curve .

Before a purchase I check Yahoo Finance conversations. You can see how much interest by number of new conversations.  Also good info from posters that know about the company.  Volume too is important.  Should be much higher than usual.

Someone pointed out that companies that price rises 100% in last year or months will probably keep going . This is very true in pennystocks. 

But these sites + Reddit are full of pumpers and dumpers.  So read through the lines.

Finally when a stock seems a winner by the point it crosses 100% for you many recoup investment.  I wait until 220-240% so I only have to sell 30% of stocks not 50%. This threshold usually happens in one day. A stock goes up gradually for days or weeks then suddenly flies.

Otcmarkets.com you can see pennystocks that are being sold ,  up to date news by ticker + screener. Some stocks have warnings. 

Unbiastock.com shows you stocks that are trading last hour or 6-12-24.

Finviz.com is a stock screener with many filters but only non-OTC .

My stock portfolio is a free app to monitor your portfolio .

TD Ameritrade lets you buy almost any stock.  RH and Webull don't allow OTC and most pennystocks are OTC. Fidelity also good but occasionally don't offer a stock. 

I trade 4-5 stocks daily but that is cuz I'm on my phone most of the day monitoring my 64 stock portfolio and seeing what others recommend or what is selling .

188,MO," Higher than normal dividends usually mean one of two things: 

1) The company has extremely limited growth prospects and they try to maintain investors by paying out high dividends to get them to accept minimal growth. There can be relatively healthy examples of this such as utilities and even a company like MO that has maintained a very ample dividend for decades with no problem. 

2) The stock has recently tanked in value but the company has maintained their dividend. This makes the yield go up. These are more dangerous because unless the share price recovers, the company will likely end up cutting their dividend causing a further downward spiral in prices as investors flee the stock. 

I always recommend people check out NOBL. You don't want to focus on high yield, but sustainable and sturdy dividends over the course of multiple decades.",Suspicious_Tension82,3,/r/investing/comments/m3eijz/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/gqp1ho0/,0.082,0.798,0.121,0.6176

Currently, I'm taking a lot of big steps trying to get serious with ""adulting"". I'm getting married this year, and looking to buy a house in the next 2 years. 


When I retire, I'll get a pension and annuity. My benefits package also funds a ""savings plan"" but I can't contribute to it, I can only decide where to allocate those funds. I have it at 1/3 split between large cap, mid cap, and small cap mutual funds.


I also have an individual brokerage account, as well as a Roth IRA I just opened, through TD Ameritrade.

The brokerage account has $2,000 mixed between a small-cap value ETF, 2 high yield dividend ETFs, and some individual stocks. My Roth I funded with $1,000 but haven't decided where to put it.


I'm trying to aggressively save at the moment (about 40% of my income) because right now my situation allows it. 20% of my income will go toward my short term goals, and I'm hoping to make regular contributions to my investments with the rest of my available disposable income.


I just need some help developing my strategy for each of my different accounts. I want to be equally diversified for the next 5 years or so between: large cap, small cap, high yield dividend, international, (maybe with just 10% in individual stocks).


Anyone have advice for which of my accounts (IE savings plan, IRA, brokerage account) to use for which category of investment? Just wanna maximize my growth and minimize my tax bills.

210,IQ,"  **Binary or Forex? (Little to no knowledge in Binary options)** 

Hey guys! I know this question has been asked a few times here. But I wanted to know the current situation.

I'm from Sri Lanka, where 1 USD = 200 LKR (local currency unit). So even if I earned like 10 USD per day, it's something significant to me; the same is for losses. Being well off with only local income here is pretty hard here. Many people here don't trade either. The maximum amount I can invest is 50 USD. I seriously can't risk any more than that. The thing is, I need some way of earning that would keep me kicking for at least 5 years. I wouldn't have to worry about food or residence for the next 5 years, so I can practice all I want before getting at it with real money. I'm a fast learner, and I'm pretty good at problem-solving in the real world. And no, I never studied anything related to investing other than basic 'Commerce and Accounting' during my O/L's. I can read a lot of stuff if necessary.

I'm not employed. My objective with the earnings would be to gradually increase my capital and buy some stocks, for long term income. And I'm in no debts and have no assets.

**I want to have a steady source of income, even it's well within 10 USD per day, within a few months.** Help me choose the right way.

I have barely learnt binary options trading. I was thinking about getting deeper into it. But many sources on the internet keeps repeating that binary options is a scam. I myself have also noticed a correct trade becoming a failure in the last second. But what I noticed is, almost all these comments are like 5 years old. couldn't find anything more recent. I actually earned like 2 dollars, in IQ options. I was just testing the platform.

What I also read on the internet is that Forex is the better option. I did earn like 2.5 dollars within an hour using just 4 dollars, but it was pure luck anyways. I honestly know nothing about Forex. I'm really really gonna have to start from scratch.

**Again, even if it's only 5 USD per day, I'm happy about that. Also, losing a little bit is fine with me, as long as I'd get it back in a short amount of time.** 

Considering that 50 USD is the upmost amount I can invest, which would be the better option to get into? Forex or Binary?

Also, if you think some other path other than Binary and Forex would be more helpful and profitable in my case, please tell me.",AtomicAnnihilator,1,/r/investing/comments/m3ei0u/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gqpejvk/,0.041,0.827,0.132,0.9891

Stock is sitting at 61, last time it went above 60 was in 2017, and it dropped like a ROCK after that

At its core, the Victoria Secret brand is a losing business. It's based in shopping malls, which are closing left and right and are on a tremendous decline.

221,DD," So, before I get into what strategy I would do, I'm going to recommend some educational resources for you incase you need them. So first is investor.gov, which has a great getting started section, aswell as being all round a great website for investing ""safe"", next is investopedia, which is like the Wikipedia for investing, but also as a great education section full of great articles. Finally the one I recommend the most is khan academy, which has some really spectacular videos on all things related to the stock market. Ok so now for my strategy, what I would do is split your money (not necessarily evenly) between three different stocks/ETFs, so the first one would be your stable stock/ETF, (example VOO)where you just set it and forget it. Next is your dividend one, where it should be sort of stable but with high dividends (example VYM), and now with your new found dividends I'd reinvest back into your stable and the following. The following is what usually is a individual stock, but could be an etf. So the following would be something that you really believe in, something that you think is undervalued and will grow. This doesn't necessarily have to be 100% safe, as you have your stable stock and to a extent your dividend stock to rely on. So an example would be Sony, which is a company I feel really passionate about on which I  made a DD that I can share with you if you would like. So , in summary, my strategy would be a very low risk etf, low risk dividend stock/etf and sort of risky stock/etf which you believe will grow faster than your stable and the market in general. Sorry for this wall of text, hopefully it helps and my inbox is open to any questions.

Robinhood has been getting worse prices for their customers, so it appeared like free trading, but the costs were hidden in other ways:

> Supporters of the practice say that routing orders to speedy traders benefits individual investors, because they can get better prices than they would at the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq.
>
> But that’s only if the broker passes that benefit, which brokers call “price improvement,” down to the customer.
>
> It’s unclear whether Robinhood gives customers that benefit. Unlike E\*Trade, Charles Schwab Corp. and TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. - which also take payment for order flow - Robinhood doesn’t publish data on how much price improvement it gives customers.

PLTR: Both my brokerage and CFRA stock report show only the last two quarters of financial data for PLTR.  Both also show yearly data for 2018-2020, which shows CARGR (compound annual revenue growth rate) of \~35%.   Even 35% is great!  But the lack of quarterly data is a unusual.  Where is the audited quarterly data?   

Despite the question marks about it's past, analysts are enthusiastic about it's future, forecasting 76% annual revenue growth over two years, which is absolutely astounding.

SNOW: all sources show a full set of 12 quarters of data for SNOW.  I presume these are audited financial results.  Squishy maybe, but not too soft.  Unlike PLTR's apparently unaudited 35% over last two years, SNOW's presumably audited growth rate is a whopping 138% over two years.  

Analysts are also enthusiastic about SNOW's future, forecasting 74% annual revenue growth over two years, which is absolutely astounding.

So the purported future is the same for both companies (76% vs 74% revenue growth), yet PLTR is trading at 40x TTM Rev and SNOW is trading at 108x TTM Rev.  Here's why:

ONE: PLTR slipped in sneaky guidance below estimates at last earnings announcement. 

TWO: it was supposed that PLTR would break out of the government sector and into the private sector after going public, but there's scant evidence of that in the most recent earnings report.  That calls some doubt on  the 76% growth forecast.  

THREE: PLTR's historic revenue growth is much lower than SNOW.  The forecast of 76% isn't reflected in it's historical data, so it's less believable.

Actively managed open ended funds like Ark are often required to liquidate at the worst times, and deploy new capital at the worst times. This harms total returns and makes holding these as long term investments risky, and can result in unusual portfolio activity as you've seen.

Someone sent me a link to a Nature paper lol (scientist here). And they are pretty heavily in TSLA. Who TF am I to say anything about ARK and Cathie Woods? I'm literally no one.

280,TDOC," Mainstream media just comes off as salty. There was a guy named Bill Cohan the other day that said she's yesterday's news and that we're not going to be talking about Cathie Woods much longer. 

Used Teledoc as an example of her giving bad advice. It's rebounded to $201 in after hours and about $30 off its lows. I personally invest in TDOC and it's now my second largest holding after the last week or so of tanking. Cathie has reiterated time and time again these are volatile funds and you shouldn't invest if you aren't going to hold 5+ years. Like her or not transparency isn't something ARK lacks in any capacity. I know TDOC is going to be volatile. I bought the dip and believe in the company long term.

281,TSLA," So here's my point of view on it-

she's pricing out companies based on their long term value right, but this long term value absolutely does consider cost to borrow. Her assessment of 5 year value can be deadass on point but if rates suddenly blow up her fund is going to lose value as a result because her 5 year valuation is going to shift alongside the price to borrow.

she's not wrong in her assessment but her funds go down in value. that's just part of the inherent risk you choose by picking her fund. it's a part of the design. speculating on the next innovative company is inherently risky

>Without central bank interventions, there is no way her funds would still be around.

well, her funds have been good because her picks have been good, would you not agree? it really hasn't just been TSLA, the ETF as a whole has consistently found gems.

 Say ARKK crashed to 107 like it did last weeks, right, and treasury yields DID go up. Instead of rebounding to 130~ like ARKK did, it'd be sitting at 107 and then slow recover over the next year or so. It would still be a good buy at 107. Because the underlying picks in ARKK are still great, they just got too far ahead of themselves in valuation, valuing their picks based on lower borrow rates.

if you are long on the companies in ARKK or long on Cathie's ability to pick winners a short term correction does not matter. The issue is, the funds have been so good at picking winners (plus ofc, enabled by the market) that you get people who really aren't long on either of these things buying into ARKK just due to its recent success.",S7EFEN,1,/r/investing/comments/m32v1h/criticism_of_ark_funds_specifically_arkg/gqnj9uj/,0.05,0.743,0.207,0.9956
282,PLTR," >well, her funds have been good because her picks have been good

This is why I don't like her funds, I don't think her picks are actually good. Now, I don't follow her religiously but I did listen to an interview where she talked about PLTR and why she was so happy with the earnings call they had.

She basically loved the earnings call because the CEO said that they are focused on the long term and not the short term, and if you care about short term than the company is not for you.

Now, this sounds great and all for a CEO to say that they are focused on the long term, and Cathie said she really liked the stock because of that. The problem though, is that PLTR was valued at 50 billion at the time and did not even expect to hit revenues of 5 billion until 2024 which is a few years from now.

To me, that is just crazy. Its nice that they are focused on the long term, but their stock valuation is batshit insane.

I just don't think Cathie actually cares about whether a company makes money or will ever make money, which is what a business is all about. She just buys stuff she thinks is cool and thats basically it. Its really not that different from handing a guy on WSB all your money and telling them to invest it for you, and then they end up YOLOing it all into TSLA.

Her strategy works great right now because nobody seems to care about company's financials anymore, but if fundamentals ever begin mattering again, her funds are not going to have a good time in my opinion.",dbgtboi,3,/r/investing/comments/m32v1h/criticism_of_ark_funds_specifically_arkg/gqnlf1s/,0.035,0.755,0.21,0.9963
