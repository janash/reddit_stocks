0,AGTC," It’s a long hold but I’m optimistic. Their last earnings call was nothing but great news, yet the price still hovers between $3.50 to $4.00. I’m using the months of sideways action to avg down. They are having consultants out in the field to design and get their manufacturing going. AGTC has some exciting things coming soon",tkepongo,2,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/p2n4jl/opinion_on_agtc/h8mlur2/,0.069,0.819,0.112,0.4232

3,AGTC," You didn't dive very deep, then.

- AGTC is building their own manufacturing facility next to their headquarters. They're not waiting on a buyout. 

- AGTC's CSO was sniped in June by a Crispr subsidiary because of the work he was able to orchestrate at AGTC. 

- AGTC is working on much more serious blindness issues than colorblindness. They're working on changing nonfunctional eyesight to functional eyesight in several avenues. They're also working on deafness, among other things. 

- AGTC has many partnerships because of their advancements in research.",jtl_jax,27,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/p2n4jl/opinion_on_agtc/h8m0446/,0.019,0.981,0.0,-0.1513

7,GME," Yes and no. What you’re describing is more like a pump n dump and happens but it’s behind closed doors. The whole GME thing was a tad bit different, but without going into the technicals of how it was an easier answer is just that it would take too much money/people to work well. Like think about a company with a $20B market cap for you guys to get 25% of the float is gunna cost more than you and your close friends (who you would have to be doing this with because with no trust this wouldn’t work).",One_Engineering_3659,1,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/p2mzk8/potentially_very_dumb_question/h8p7mr6/,0.056,0.748,0.195,0.9486
