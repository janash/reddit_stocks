4,ONE," I feel like everyone makes the same mistake who comes here. I was the same. 

NONE of us actually WATCH the stock over 4 weeks. We all see a green day and buy at the top, and then watch our money sink like a stone. Thing is, do the reverse. I usually buy on a Friday when it's in the shitter, and sell on monday when it moons/green. I know it's going to be hard for you to do it because you want to think linearly. My stock week begins on Friday, and then runs Monday to Monday. I always sell on Mondays. I watch all noobs BUY on Mondays because they think it will moon over the week. It never seems to happen that way does it? Now I can't give financial advice, because if I did, and you followed it, you would pick that ONE stock that ran opposite the market and lose all your money and blame me. So, this is not financial advice. But what I did was watched the stock for 5 weeks, and found that on Fridays, it gets shorted into oblivion and on Mondays it moons. So, before you lose your life savings, take ten minutes and go study some charts. I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice.",tommygunz007,2,/r/pennystocks/comments/o3839c/please_dont_look/h2bmxae/,0.047,0.924,0.029,-0.6059
