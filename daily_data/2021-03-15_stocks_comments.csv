Valuations are really high, no doubt about it, anyway growth will be there in the next years and earnings will ramp up making P/E lower and valuations more affordable.

41,ON," Yes, that’s correct... but what I mean is that a small change in bond yields is not enough to hold back companies that are growing because they are adding value. 

Take my favorite stock right now, ON semiconductor, for example. They provide about $500 worth of chips in every internal combustion engine car sold today. For EVs, they provide about $1000 per car. With the global chip shortage, they are selling every chip they can make (and improving margins). EVs are only 6% of the market right now but we are transitioning to 100%... that’s a long growth runway. 

So, what does this have to do with bond yields / interest rates?  Exactly.

72,DD," If you had invested in any of the blue chip stocks when you were “young” (I’m going to assume 20-30 years) then today you would be retired and working towards being wealthy.  If you lost in stocks it’s because you sold on market corrections, crashes, bought high sold low, yolo invested in shit companies and didnt do any DD on your portfolio.

If I invested when I was his age 20 years ago (instead of spending it on stupid shit) in blue chip stocks and didnt touch any of the money I invested monthly, then today I’d have millions of dollars and be retiring at 38 years old.  Just because YOU made poor decisions/mistakes doesnt invalidate any of the advice given here.  

This is the age where he SHOULD be investing in stocks.  As long as he does his DD and lowers his risk profile by picking blue chip stocks.  

Don’t project your shitty past on someone who is asking for stock advice, you couldve said, “These were the mistakes I made when I invested in stocks when I was young, don’t do this.” and you wouldve been well received.

To the thread OP: My biggest mistake in my younger years was not investing in the stock market, don’t be like me and certainly don’t be like this fucking clown.  And you can do both, set aside 15% of your pay in an IRA or 401k AND put extra money into the stock market.

Best tip I can give, once a paycheck buy one stock if that is all you can afford and if it’s a blue chip you can set it and forget it.

79,HUGE," on the IRA...do you plan on living past 60? retirement doesnt mean pulling all of your money out of investments and sleeping on top of it. Likely a lot of it sits in the same investment vehicles it has been in the whole time.

that being said, by your comments on retiring at 40 i'm assuming you're around 18-24 max...awesome you're thinking about this stuff already. BUT, if you're serious about retiring at 40, you need to invest some serious effort in the ""financial freedom"" mindset AKA spend absolutely no money on anything that is not absolutely essential. Real investing is NOT a means to make millions of dollars in 10years without a HUGE amount of luck. you can definitely do it but you're going to need to think about saving waaaaay more than what to invest in, that should be the easy part.

But my advice is? All I was saying is just because you don't make much,doesn't mean you shouldn't save. If anything, that is a reason to save more. Are you really this butthurt over me saying that the original posters advice was garbage?

>and your trying to brag about your wage at a young age which is not guaranteed forever and you'll realize when you have a family how little thay actually is, even tho its already around the USA median.


Don't plan to have a family, so although I appreciate your half assed attempt at a demeaning insult, it's not going very well, Especially since my income will do nothing but increase over the years so whether or not I have a family wouldn't matter.

110,CO," That's a very good point!  Most city fleet trucks will be doing driving in low-MPG situations in short distances around the city and then heading back to the garage for 12+ hours of charging.  I think Ford's experience with fleet and getting to know what their customers want and need really set themselves up nicely for the battle of the EV light truck segment; this is one area that newcomers like Tesla and Rivian come up short in.

Plus, if you know anyone that works white collar stuff and parks in a garage downtown for a job, you'll see plenty of pickups that are mainly used as commuter vehicles and used to tow toys (boats, bikes, go ""up north"") a handful of times a year.  Rivian might appeal to these buyers a little bit more (think WA/OR/CO/MI Subaru owners) but the EV-150 is a damn strong competitor too.

134,BB," If you plan on holding for a long time, you should average down if the price is holding steady like BB did once it tanked from the meme jump. Example: If you bought in 100 shares at $25, then bought another 100 at $8, suddenly you've got 200 shares with an average cost of $16.5. If you buy 200 shares at $8, now it's $13.58 average cost. It will take forever to so much as break even at a $25 average cost, but averaging down means you can exit sooner, or just make more as it goes up.

This helps you in long-term game because now you're only -$5.58 a share rather than -$17. It also means if you're going to sell call options your basis is significantly lower for a less risky strike price or a strike price that generates larger premiums (you'd only be getting $18 premium for a $25 1APR2021 call versus $54 for a $15.50 1APR2021 call).

151,FB," It's good that you're inviting counter arguments.

I agree, tech by and large is going to do well.

But given the long horizon, there can be some risks:

1. Tech, assuming you're talking about US tech, could hit growth stagnation. Netflix for example is clearly struggling with scaling. Unlike Google which can scale enormously Netflix has to raise prices everytime. Even Google can insert only so many ads in an youtube video or a search result.


2. Rise if China could come as a rude geopolitical awakening. They're going to spread their influence in growth markets like Africa pushing out US tech. Google and others have to play by strict rules not to bribe foreign governments but China has none of that.


3. Continuing animosity between the government and the tech companies. While any breakup is unlikely, new acquisitions also could become rare. Imagine a Google without Android and YouTube or a Facebook without Instagram.


4. Privacy issues. People are somewhat more aware about tech and privacy. Google's recent announcement of avoiding individual targeting is an example, also apple's removal of FB access to device id. Although these steps are not really going to be impactful to these companies, any new tracking mechanism could be difficult to implement.


5. European Union. This is probably the top 1 or 2 in this list. EU hates tech, justifiably so in many cases. They're trying to protect their citizens rights and their businesses. Going to be a constant issue although they won't be able to go beyond a certain point without pushback from the US government. It'll be occasional $5 billion fine every few years.


6. Global tax regime. So far these companies escaped heavy taxation by having arrangements with tax friendly jurisdictions like Ireland for Europe. After waiting for the US government to come to the table to develop a global framework, many individual countires are unilaterally imposing taxes on these companies for activities within their jurisdiction. That will be a problem as rax costs will rise for these companies.


7. Globalization. Increasing globalization can cause unrest because of a lack of good jobs and these companies will be the primary target irrespective of whoever gets elected. It's unpredictable what shape it will take but higher targeted taxation is a real possibility.

160,USA," Honestly, I think it's a safer assumption to think that tech will keep performing well, compared to other risky daily life activities - like driving a car. But in my opinion, unless something goes really wrong, tech is not only going to keep doing well, it's probably going to eat up almost all other industries.

But if one has to come up with some scenarios, I can think of the following:

1. **USA unstable (external) -** USA becoming unstable because of some major non-nuclear war.
2. **USA unstable (internal) -** USA becoming unstable because of internal conflicts.
3. **Severe Pandemic -**  A very severe pandemic that takes out even the delivery infrastructures (a relatively real possibility)
4. **Nuclear War -** A significant enough nuclear war that affect more than a few million people.
5. **Declining USA -** USA declining considerably in influence and a free country not rising up fast enough to take its top spot.
6. **Anti-tech Culture -** A cultural changes due to any reason that makes technology uncool or something not in vogue (hard to imaging this scenario, but could happen).
7. **Alien contact/disclosure -** This is a silly one of course. But given the numerous reports of UAPs abound nowadays, no one knows for sure what'd happen in the unlikely case if they do turn out to be for real. After listening to some credible people speak on it, I think it's a remote but reasonable possibility. E.g. - [Cmdr. David Fravor on Lex Fridman Podcast](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjb_IjS57LvAhWNURUIHbg-ChMQFjAAegQIBBAD&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DaB8zcAttP1E&usg=AOvVaw1aQgJw_xHS4b_xcWIAB1GW).
8. **Major US Political Change -** Change in political nature of the US and other tech generating countries, such as becoming too socialistic to allow rapid innovation by privately owned companies.
9. **Any** [**Dark-age**](https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/11/17106910/elon-musk-ai-threat-mars-moon-colonization-nukes-sxsw-2018) **Inducing Event -** like an extremely power solar flare or coronal mass ejection from the sun that kills a huge number of people, or an asteroid impact that although doesn't cause total extinction.
10. **Death of a Large Percentage of Humanity -** For any reason, if a significant percentage of humanity dies, the current large scale innovation economy will become unsustainable and it'd most likely collapse, with only small companies and efforts remaining trying to resurrect the great technological times we're living in right now.",futurist9,2,/r/stocks/comments/m5fy87/in_which_scenario_tech_wont_keep_growing/gr17ofe/,0.086,0.809,0.105,0.6798

167,TV," Like I said these are only worst cases. Don't be worried too much. If you look at bull cases there are zillions of them. I'm sure (or at least hope) US tech will be at the forefront.

That said, take all emotions out of investing. Use proper instruments (stocks preferred, avoid options unless you're familiar with its use, even that only occasionally).

Choose the companies wisely. Look at both the technicals and the fundamentals. F for choosing the company and T for the investment timing - both entry and exit.

Don't invest all at once even if you have the money. Also understand new risks like how bond yield affects tech even though that's going to go away imo, it can increase your initial cost.

Let's say you're researching Google.

Fundamentals side: You should look at ARPU, how it's calculated, how it's changed, cloud revenue projection, what's going on with android, ad tech changes, devices, Chrome, Android TV

Management (can't stress this enough). This is very important for this horizon.

Technical analysis: Know the basis, how to read the chart. Very, very important. You can invest without it but it can give you proper signals on the timing - if the stock is ripe for investment. You can checkout https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=20iECG65_To (Not affiliated with the channel not recommending any stock discussed in the video). 

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=3x4t2rLYXBw for volume profile (this is a day trading video but this is helpful for longterm also).

https://www.investors.com/ibd-videos/ Don't look at the exact recommendations but look at why they're choosing that stock that day.

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=S72pwDRbK4o This is how big money managers think. It's important to understand that because they control the market.

Again, no recommendations of the channels or stocks discussed.

I'm emphasizing technicals because I've made the mistake of ignoring it in the past and paid for it. But still fundamentals are the most important part.

Don't put all your money at once. And know your companies. It's not a bad idea to keep the list small.

 Don't get too attached to the companies. If things don't work out and you think its not going to change soon you should be willing to switch. Same with losses.

Don't forget if you're investing in bigger companies they can be made obsolete by new companies as well.

Also keep your eye on general stuff, how they're transforming and how they might affect your portfolio: digital curr., transportation, energy etc.

Also if you actually believe any supermajor is sincerely investing in clean energy and speeding up the demise of its own profits, I have a bridge to sell you.

The majors do this every few years to get regulators of their back, but there’s a reason BP isn’t called Beyond Petroleum anymore.

Hell nearly the entire management of Shell’s clean energy projects resigned last year in protest of how little Shell was investing in them

211,WTI," No they can't. Sure they can technically but doing so runs the risk of running out of ullage for storage, capacity in units or worse hitting limits that are already hard to hit in other units. The linear program on a typical highly profitable large refinery is very restrictive even in normal times on what possible crude slate that can be run. They can't just magically at a flip of a button run differently as they are configured to operate with certain market constraints in mind. 

The market has seen huge shifts and demand swings in the crude slate in the last year because one of the very few handles a refiner has to meet supply constraints is to source a different type of crude. Previously already expensive crudes shot up in price even as the WTI dipped below zero. Much of refining capacity in Europe was running at minimum rates last year even as petrol demand increased precisely due to the constraints at work.

A few minor refineries may not produce jet, but they are hardly relevant on the balance sheet of an oil company. But quite critically, those which don't sell jet, are *designed* not to sell jet. In the meantime in my own company they decided to spend many 10s of millions to recommission two previous decommissioned claus units precisely because of issues such as not being able to process sulfur. In the time when we were running them we ended up paying people to take away products that we previously sold at a profit.

You can't just change the product mix of a refinery, and if you can you can't expect it to make a profit doing so.",thegarbz,2,/r/stocks/comments/m5gxkd/why_oil_companies_are_still_not_at_pre_covid/gr16ja8/,0.107,0.827,0.065,-0.8987

251,CRSP," Those are the big ones I'm familiar with from my work (dry lab epidemiology). I'm unfamiliar with CRSP as that's at the wet-lab/applied health care end.

I'd say CRSP does have a lot of potential and I get the hype around it, but its success will depend on a global ethical consensus which hasn't been addressed yet. The make or break for CRSP and gene editing treatments in general will be what sitiuations it gets approved for (i.e. will germ-line treatments be deemed acceptable and which diseases people think should or should not be treated with gene editing). There's a lot of strong and mixed feelings in the field around this which will be amplified once these questions are brought to the general public. He's work (the Chinese group that used CRISPR on human embryos) is a major set-back for this because of the bs he pulled (I'll avoid a long rant on this).

274,IMO," I like VTI as the core position. IMO You could consider 10-15% international (non-US) exposure given relative underperformance in recent years. Some country specific markets are likely to mean revert and also be less correlated to the rest of your portfolio. For example, iShares EWS, EWU, in particular. I’d avoid all ARK funds. That’s played out, they are too large and now unmanageable for outperformance. And a lot of downside risk in the next two years. I’d consider something like the Baron Opportunity Fund instead.

PBW (Green Energy) - Current administration.

399,LOVE," Sure

There were two big reasons why the NASDAQ had a correction.  The first was fear. Specifically fear of inflation.  The thing about fear is that it usually doesnt last very long, especially if the faith behind it starts to falter.  Almost every indicator is showing that inflation fears were overblown.  Its also been about 6 weeks now since the inflation fears began...its becoming old news and investors are becoming less afraid.

The second reason for the correction was the rotation of major funds from tech into value stocks.  These rotations generally play out over several weeks.  Most funds that were going to rotate, already have and the rotation is more or less complete.

Some other reasons also include the stimmy checks that are coming.  One study showed that 50% of millennials were going to invest that money in the stock market.  Millennials LOVE tech stocks and with them on discount its hard to imagine there wont be some money coming in.  Another reason is the opposite of fear....its Fear Of Missing Out.  Once theres some big green days come in, it fuels even more green as people dont want to miss out.  I have a feeling we will be seeing this in the next couple months.

Then again these are just my opinions and I am not a financial advisor so take them as what they are.",Bsdave103,2,/r/stocks/comments/m5gx22/rstocks_daily_discussion_monday_mar_15_2021/gr0c29c/,0.094,0.833,0.073,-0.6347

408,DIS," It depends on the risk you want to take. ARK* funds are extremely speculative and do well when the market is running hot. The problem is, as we just saw over the last 4 weeks, any slight downturn is detrimental to them and all speculative stock.

If you're willing to take the risk of loss, bearing in mind ARKK has already run up north of 100% within the last year, then go for it. The problem is that the party will eventually come a stop and when it does, I'd bet good money ARK funds go the way of all the prior FotM actively managed ETFs and dies. If you think you can get out before that happens, I say pull the trigger.

If you want set-and-forget investing, I say shoot for market-wide indexes. Maybe keep your DIS and APPL if you think they'll outperform the market in the long-run. For those indexes you'll never beat the market, but you'll never out-lose the market either.

Coincidentally, that is my hottest this year really. Great minds. This year I am looking exclusively into cloud and data stocks. Surprisingly, none of the cloud or data stocks comes even close to the individual platforms of AWS, GCP and Azure. Most cloud companies are just wrappers on Big cloud.

If they were too split and IPOed individual cloud division the entire cloud industry would be disrupted. All the other cloud stocks would really crash as most of these companies rarely provide standalone value and are offering GUI or Customer-friendly iterations of big cloud # services.",anyfactor,1,/r/stocks/comments/m5debx/my_only_investments_are_in_amazon_and_alibaba/gr0t0zu/,0.034,0.902,0.064,0.6549

## The Fundamentals of Olympic Steel - My Level of Safety

Olympic Steel is a microcap with a market cap of only about $150M as of Feb 1st, 2021. The current stock price of $14 is still near its 5 year low. Here are my key metrics on Olympic Steel and why I like my margin of safety:

* Current assets of $395M and current Liabilities of only $96M, a current ratio over 4! Also a net current surplus of about $300M - with a market cap of only $150M!
* $233 of the current assets is in inventory as of Sept, 30th 2020. This inventory should be valued much higher with the surge in steel prices.
* Only $177M in Debt as of Sept, 30th 2020.
* So the net capital surplus minus the debt is over $120M.
* The net asset value of $24 a share, so its price to book is 50%.
* For Year-end 2019, produced over $120M of free cash flow. Almost the size of its current market capitalization!
* The last quarterly results in Sept. 2020 showed about $23M of free cash flow.

## The Fundamentals of Olympic Steel - My Level of Safety

Olympic Steel is a microcap with a market cap of only about $150M as of Feb 1st, 2021. The current stock price of $14 is still near its 5 year low. Here are my key metrics on Olympic Steel and why I like my margin of safety:

* Current assets of $395M and current Liabilities of only $96M, a current ratio over 4! Also a net current surplus of about $300M - with a market cap of only $150M!
* $233 of the current assets is in inventory as of Sept, 30th 2020. This inventory should be valued much higher with the surge in steel prices.
* Only $177M in Debt as of Sept, 30th 2020.
* So the net capital surplus minus the debt is over $120M.
* The net asset value of $24 a share, so its price to book is 50%.
* For Year-end 2019, produced over $120M of free cash flow. Almost the size of its current market capitalization!
* The last quarterly results in Sept. 2020 showed about $23M of free cash flow.

486,USA," High speed rail definitely makes sense, but there are several problems with the USA versus other places:

* So many cities - where I am from there were only a few major cities with direct flights from each to each other. There were no hub airports etc. Building a high speed rail along the busiest air routes made sense, but like America, the next problem was the big one
* High land prices, private land ownership, strict regulations, varied ownership and interests - just look at the people trying to build energy pipelines. I think the statistics were ""1 permit per mile"", that's a lot of permits. They have to travel through tribal lands, certain people don't want it etc. It just gets too hard
* Cost of safety, unions, varying state laws- American worker safety is world class, the problem is that it's part of the reason it's so expensive to build anything. Safety is paramount, but it's very expensive to run a big project safely. Bring Unions in and you have cocktail of cost increases and demands. 

In the end, the project costs so much that a ticket would be more than a flight. It might be worth it if it connected airports together for travelers that didn't happen to live exactly where the train left and want to go exactly where it ended up, but that adds a ton of cost as well. 

In China, they can just steal the land, use slave labor, build the trains with cheap motivated workers. Here in the USA we will probably pause the project because someone was mis-gendered.

490,DD," I’m sure there are a few correct answers in the thread. Something to keep in mind as well, we just had a market shift from growth stocks to value stocks. That’s why huge tech companies like Tesla have seen huge drops as well. These dips aren’t because the companies have down poorly (with the exception of some). The transition of the market happens from time to time due to things like bond yields, inflation, and tax changes. Unfortunately companies that are more volatile are seen less favorable at this time. You’ll also see ETF’s for tech such as Cathie Wood’s $ARKK have dipped too but index on value companies are up.

548,GME," Congratz on your good timing :)

Might want to set that buy order a \*little\* higher than $179, though...even though with the short interest on GME way down now and it not being a short-squeeze anymore, there are other things to consider:

1. Most retail brokerages still have restrictions on GME. They let you buy and sell it long now, but if you try to short sell it, you get a message that says 'shares on this security are too difficult to borrow currently'...and won't allow the trade.
2. People can buy puts on GME, if they really want to...but with IV super-duper-pooper high on GME right now, no-one in their right mind would do so (clearly last week I was not in my right mind)...
3. This means the only way the stock can go down is if retail or institutions sell it long, or institutions short it...

So...it will probably rebound short-term.

570,MAS," I guess whether or not an economic crash would result in good or bad change depends on the current political climate, and on this point let's remember that any economic crisis affects the whole world, not just America.

I think the biggest metric for whether or not a crisis will be good or bad depends on the ideology and zeitgeist of the societies around the world. If the world is largely tilting towards right-wing fascism, then any resulting reform would take that shape. If the world is turning towards socialism, reform would from a leftist perspective. Or, as in 2008, if the majority of the world is liberal then the resulting society will become liberal (or in 2008's case, stay liberal.)

So where are we now? There certainly has been a growing right-wing extremism throughout most of the liberal capitalist countries around the world. Look at the Republican party in America, Bolsonaro in Brazil, Bojo and Nigel Farage in the UK, growing right-wing extremism in Russia, Ukraine, Hungary, Poland and Turkey. All of these certainly indicate that reform would be reactionary.

I certainly don't think that liberalism would fare well if there was another economic crash. While it is possible that modern liberalism could survive, I think it would require a huge PR-spin as liberalism seems to be ineffective at internalising the externalities it has created, and people are noticing this. Its why there's growing radicalism on both political sides.

So how could labour/socialism fare? Well, I think we're currently seeing the rise of leftism throughout much of Europe as many in Western and central Europe are becoming disillusioned with right-wing reactionary politics that has dominated much of European politics since 2014. The largest indicator of this, I'd argue, is the rapidly growing Green Party in Germany while the AfD is loosing support with the German population, the failure of Le Pen in France, the disaster that has been Brexit and Nigel Farage being made politically irrelevant.

But let's not only focus on Europe. We've seen massive leftist/populist activism in the South-American and Asian world, even having the largest general strike in history happen in India not too long ago, the massive strikes in Chile against their neo-liberal government, the massive protests against climate change throughout Asia, the victory of the MAS party in Bolivia and the imprisonment of Jaenine Áñez. We've also seen growing populism in America with the majority popular BLM movement, the growing progressive wing in the Democratic party, and the loss for Donald Trump.

I think currently, except for Eastern Europe and Russia, most of the Liberal democracies around the globe are starting to turn away from reactionary right-wing extremism and towards Labour politics. Would the left or the right win if there was a call for reform today? I don't know, I think it's up in the air.

572,PS," I think GoPro is still undervalued by a lot today. This is a company that has had to learn a lot about how to run a lean hardware company and not just try to pretend like they are an Apple or a typical silicon valley hardware company. 

Their most recent quarter showed $116M subscription based revenue and I believe overall revenue $350M +. Just based on the sticky subscription revenue and where the market is at with P/S ratio in similar industries, even giving a PS ratio of 5 to their subscription model... $116 x 4 x 5 = $2.32 Billion. This is just revenue from the subscription. At the current market cap of 1.6 B, I think they are incredibly undervalued. 

Assuming the annual hardware revenue of $700M (I believe last years was similar), assuming a PS of 3, that's $2.1 B in market value. 

So a  total market cap of $4.4 B would not be out of place. And I believe the market is just starting to realize that. I think this rally could go for a bit....

576,USB," The issue i have with Gopro is that they don't really have breakthrough products anymore. Does the hero 9 really offer that much more than the hero 8?  Unless you're a real video technophile,  most users record videos to slap it on youtube.  From a user's perspective, it's not really worth it to continually upgrade cameras.  Add to that clones that are 1/2 the price and getting better every day, the competition is getting stiffer.

Some times I feel like the powers to be make good decisions only after having exhausted the bad ones. I'm not talking about the Karma fiasco, but little things like not having a removable lens protector on the Hero 8. At least they re-introduced it  on the newest version after so many people bitching about it (and rightly so) . Or like finally having the USB trigger power. That should have been a feature 3 or 4 generations ago (just like on some of the clones). Little things like that add up.

I think Gopro overall is a decent company, and obviously the 800lb gorilla in the action camera room. But where are they going? What will the hero 10 feature? 8k if they can find an effective way to deal with overheating issues? When will 8k monitors/tv be mainstream enough ? 4k is currently about 40% of the market.  When the optimal performance of a product is  tied to another consumer product over which you have no control, there is a point where you can only push so far out. After that, you have to wait till the market catches up.

From improving self-driving cars to modelling chemical reactions.

Right now, supercomputers can only analyse the most basic molecules. But quantum computers operate using the same quantum properties as the molecules they’re trying to simulate. They will have no problem handling even the most complicated reactions, unlocking many secrets hidden in our universe. 

More efficient products like new composites for structures or even batteries in electric cars, better and cheaper drugs, or vastly improved solar panels. 

Quantum computers will find a use anywhere where there’s a large, uncertain complicated system that needs to be simulated. That could be anything from predicting the financial markets, to improving weather forecasts, to modelling the behaviour of individual electrons.

593,ETH," *Had to repost because I named a stock that's not allowed.*

A few spaces where I see huge potential:

* Plant-based foods: A lot of these products have been getting extremely good. I'm not a vegetarian myself and doubt I ever will be, but I've been eating a lot less meat due to the really good plant-based alternatives for an affordable price. People have also started to realize that if we want to reduce climate change, virus outbreaks and animal suffering, eating less meat is a hard requirement. On top of that, plant-based food will become a lot cheaper to make as companies develop the technology and reach mass scale, while meat will only become more expensive as we start taxing carbon emissions properly and animal welfare requirements become more strict. Stocks to watch: TTCF and 0SI.F (Frankfurt listing for company I wasn't allowed to name).

* Lab grown meat: This could eventually displace plant-based foods and the remainder of the real meat industry. That said, it's still in its infancy and will probably need another decade before it becomes economically viable. I personally plan to ride the plant-based wave for 5-10 years and then switch to lab-grown meat investments. Stocks to watch: None yet.

* Genomics : Don't have much more to add than what others have already said around this sub. This will change our world more than 99.9% of people realize. Stocks to watch: Just check ARKG's holdings.

* Freelance space: Everything in the world is going global, and the freelance space is no exception. There's been some stigma on freelancing due to low pay, low quality work from India and platforms with a focus on unprofessional environments like Fiverr, but this space has huge potential. I personally run a business that makes video games and the amount of high quality talent you can work with online nowadays is amazing. Not just individuals but even other studios. The enterprise future of freelancing is huge. Stocks to watch: UPWK.

* Weed: Obvious story with all the legalization happening around the world. Eventually the space will mature and a few winners will emerge to become large multinational companies, but it's difficult to predict which ones. Stocks to watch: Heard some good things about HITIF and GTEC, but haven't researched them enough yet.

* Space: SpaceX has made commercial space companies a reality. We are closer to asteroid mining than people realize, which will be the biggest economic opportunity since Europeans set sail to the New World. That said, it's still too early to really invest in this. Stocks to watch: None as long as SpaceX is private, all the other companies are nowhere compared to them.

A few spaces where I see huge potential:

* Plant-based foods: A lot of these products have been getting extremely good. I'm not a vegetarian myself and doubt I ever will be, but I've been eating a lot less meat due to the really good plant-based alternatives for an affordable price. People have also started to realize that if we want to reduce climate change, virus outbreaks and animal suffering, eating less meat is a hard requirement. On top of that, plant-based food will become a lot cheaper to make as companies develop the technology and reach mass scale, while meat will only become more expensive as we start taxing carbon emissions properly and animal welfare requirements become more strict. Stocks to watch: TTCF and 0SI.F (Frankfurt listing for company I wasn't allowed to name).

* Lab grown meat: This could eventually displace plant-based foods and the remainder of the real meat industry. That said, it's still in its infancy and will probably need another decade before it becomes economically viable. I personally plan to ride the plant-based wave for 5-10 years and then switch to lab-grown meat investments. Stocks to watch: None yet.

* Genomics : Don't have much more to add than what others have already said around this sub. This will change our world more than 99.9% of people realize. Stocks to watch: Just check ARKG's holdings.

* Freelance space: Everything in the world is going global, and the freelance space is no exception. There's been some stigma on freelancing due to low pay, low quality work from India and platforms with a focus on unprofessional environments like Fiverr, but this space has huge potential. I personally run a business that makes video games and the amount of high quality talent you can work with online nowadays is amazing. Not just individuals but even other studios. The enterprise future of freelancing is huge. Stocks to watch: UPWK.

* Weed: Obvious story with all the legalization happening around the world. Eventually the space will mature and a few winners will emerge to become large multinational companies, but it's difficult to predict which ones. Stocks to watch: Heard some good things about HITIF and GTEC, but haven't researched them enough yet.

* Space: SpaceX has made commercial space companies a reality. We are closer to asteroid mining than people realize, which will be the biggest economic opportunity since Europeans set sail to the New World.

627,DD," I wouldn't go near this airline, or any other for that matter. 

I hate to say this and I do not wish this to happen, but it wouldn't surprise me if planes start falling out of the sky left right and centre in the coming months. So many planes have been grounded for so long, [there are bound to be maintenance errors, nests growing in plane instruments and pilots will inevitably be rusty](https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-airlines-safety-idUKKBN28O33D). I think on the basis of pure probability there will be some kind of accident as the world comes out of Covid, if not several. Not to mention the Boeing 737-max is returning to service and I have huge reservations still about the vetting process that plane has gone through. I still wouldn't fly on it.

On that basis, I would not invest in any airline, let alone one that is still finding its feet and likely to cut many corners in the face of keeping costs down in the Covid era. 

I see this as a high-risk play where the potential upside (if any) does not make this worth taking on.

Erik G. Braathen  who found this airlines , was in the board of directors when Norwegian air shuttle had IPO, I just read the PDF document from 2008. He left the company in 2009.

2007-2016
Vice President, Crew Management, Norwegian Air Resources

2003-2005
and personal hiring, Norwegian Air Shuttle

You can check out the performance of Norwegian air shuttle in those, years these 2 were on the board. 

I am not saying that these 2 were the cause, different times and many other great people were factors as well.

I am just worried about the license part actually, but the board are very experienced and competent people.

The applied for the license , here is a part of the document 

In order to commence air traffic activities, the Company is dependent on obtaining an air operating certificate (""AOC"") from the Civil Aviation Authority of Norway (the ""NCAA""). The Company submitted an AOC application to the NCAA on 28 October 2020.

632,ETSY," It's important to differentiate between companies that have seen a temporary benefit from covid, and companies that have seen future growth pulled forward because of covid.  People often make the mistake of confusing the two.

For example, Clorox has seen huge growth during COVID thanks to increases in sales of bleach and other disinfectant products.  That's a temporary benefit.  When covid is over the sales of those products will drop back down closer to historical levels.  People aren't going to use those products as often as they did during covid on a permanent basis.  Zoom is another example.  While people and businesses will continue to use zoom to some extent on a permanent basis, there is no chance they will continue to use it as often as they did during covid.  And certainly no chance they use it more (that's impossible).  That's why Zoom has sold off in such a big way, and may be headed for further drops when future earnings reports show big drops in growth.

But there are lots of companies that fundamentally change the way we live and work and were headed towards strong growth anyway, but that growth was sped up during covid.  ETSY is a good example of this.  E-commerce is the future and as soon as people become comfortable shopping online, they're not going to suddenly stop as soon as they can go to stores again.  Not when you can find exactly what you want online and have it delivered quickly and easily.  These types of companies may see temporary pullbacks, or even basing patterns, while investors get a feel for their post-covid growth rates.  Those are good buying opportunities for these companies.",SirGasleak,7,/r/stocks/comments/m5i1uo/whats_your_opinion_on_etsy/gr0ezm1/,0.035,0.802,0.163,0.9875

Think of it this way: ETSY has a $28 Billion market cap. Do you think that’s too high or too low? Should it eventually overtake EBay ($38 billion)? Will ETSY ever be a $100 Billion company?

They have so much going on. Can revolutionize the mental health field. Long term. Major investors. Kevin O’Leary. The new acquisition bringing google AI lead and Pfizer’s chief medical officer. Bro they are Trail Blazers. High risk yes. But if it takes off then it’s the Tesla of mental health therapy. May 1st expect clinical trial results. Much bigger news than the uplifting in my opinion. Sorry at work, cannot write more. But longer term.

703,AAPL," MO - they've been on a multi-year downward trend and they sell cigarettes, not exactly the best looking company at first glance. However, that downtrend is starting to break down and they give sexy, sexy dividends. The main reason Im bullish is due to vaping products and weed. Altira has a couple of patents for some cannabis vapes, hired some lobbyists from cannabis/hemp law-firms and are trying to get CBD legalized. They wouldnt be doing that unless they have big plans for the future, and as a tobacco company alot of that infrastructure must commute. The vaping thing is mainly because im in college and some of these mfs vape like a goddamn chimney; life long customers MO can depend on.

DIS- they own like, every single major entertainment property and they show no signs of slowing down. Sometimes I think that they want a monopoly on the entire entertainment industry or something lol. I dont bet against the mouse anymore, its never worked out.

AAPL- well, its fucking apple. And there are rumors that they're trying to break into AR/VR. I work in my school's virtual reality and 3D printing lab. Commercial VR tech is really cool, but so far not the most practical for home use. Setting everything up is a bit asinine, and I cant imagine the average person loading up a VR set on the regular despite the fact that everyone I know agrees that its cool as fuck. I can totally see AAPL dominating the market once they give it the Apple makeover. (more intuitive controls, simple design, more lightweight hardware requirements, easy setup etc.) Best part is, even if this rumored headset goes the way of google glasses, you're still left with a bunch of shares of apple.

KTOS- I like them and did a DD. Long story short, they have consistent and growing contracts with the US and are primed to enter the aerospace field. If it matters to you, the stock is also part of some ARK funds.

APPH- This one is highly, highly speculative and the company I have the least stake in. Theyre an AgTech company making indoor farms, mainly for tomatos but they plan on branching out. I love the sustainable business model, and as someone who uses a similar service (Im in Canada) I believe that theres a genuine need for these types of farms. However, they're a very new company and they probably wont be seeing any profits until they scale up alot more. Its also not like the tech is groundbreaking or anything, so R&D barriers to entry aren't very high. I will say that as someone who grows weed and vegetables hydroponically that the equipment needed for either is almost identical. So, in the case of full legalization theres a chance they might start growing some of that cash crop to subsidize vegetable sales, something hard to make a profit on without economies of scale. Of course, this entirely depends on how legalization is gonna get rolled out or if they even decide that weed is a good bumper crop. Hence why Im not about to YOLO anything into this anytime soon, I just want some exposure. 

COP- I like making money more than I hate investing in oil. And so far this company has made me good money. Green energy may be the future, but that transition is unfortunately gonna take a couple of decades. In the meantime, we're gonna have to power the factories that make solar panels and windmills with something else, and it looks like thats gonna be oil for the time being.

The death cross name derives from the X-shape created when the short-term moving average descends below the long-term moving average. Historically, the pattern precedes a prolonged downturn for both the long-term and short-term moving averages. The death cross is a signal that short-term momentum in a stock or stock index is slowing, but it is not always a reliable indicator that a bull market is about to end. There have been many times when a death cross appeared, such as in the summer of 2016, when it proved to be a false indicator.""

Let me say it another way, as CEO of a failing business I can take out a $50M loan, distribute it in dividends, skyrocketing the div yield, and the market would take it negatively due to debt service payments hurting future operations. 

Simply looking at div yield is like saying my business had a good quarter because k1 distro was high. Dividends aren't static and the yield is determined historically, not predictively. 

GEO has cut their dividend in half in the last two quarters. Predicting whether or not they cut it again next quart is more important than monitoring what they did last quarter. But most importantly, would be predicting their net income next quarter. Whether or not they pay it out, buyback stock or stockpile it is short of inconsequential.

It’s already started, since earnings is March 23rd, and the expected report right after they fired their CFO will be B.A.D!

https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/02/25/gamestops-stock-worth-ten-dollars-at-the-most-analyst.html

If you’re an investor seeking advice. SELL BEFORE EARNINGS! 

You do NOT have to worry about a stock rally in GME after earnings. If there is a rally, it might be from $9-$14 because Ryan provides a strategy for making GameStop digital which makes no sense since Microsoft and Sony have point to action to the consumer direct, so GameSmart as I see it, is a BANKRUPT company with a B- credit rating.

Please heed advice and if you especially made money, SELL. You will never regret that, because the upside is nominal on some @Redditors trying to manipulate a stock. Don’t invest based on that, please.

Invest on fundamentals, which if you look at objectively, is a BANKRUPT business similar to BlockBuster, it also had a “Dead Cat Bounce”, and then Crash. Bam. Thank you Mam!

I use a 9 exponential moving average and a 30 weighted. Also a 50 simple to look at trend. Basically to go long I need the stock to be over the 50 and then I wait for the 9 to cross the 30 for entry.

You analyze past performance to help plan for the future, but nothing is ever guaranteed. The key is to not over leverage on one stock, know when your analysis was wrong and pull out before you lose too much money. Protect your profits, don’t forget to cash out at key levels.

Honestly you can spend hours, weeks studying and planning but the market can pivot on you in a heartbeat. All these DDs you see posted are not all winners. I’ll reiterate, protect your money! If you see your analysis was wrong then pull out, don’t let it suck you into a price range where now you are forced to stick it out with that stock just to get your money back.

Scaling into positions is one of the best things you can do instead of jumping in. ie. you want to buy 500 of AAPL, instead of doing 1 order of 500 at whatever price start with 100, watch the stock for a little to make sure it’s not going against your analysis, add another 100 when you see a good entry point, and so on until you reach your inversement amount.

3) Nowhere in your ""source"" I am able to find the statement that Tesla's auto pilot is ""the most dangerous driver-assistance system"". It is only mention the most. Which makes sense, considering so many tesla's are on the road now. 

4) Waymo lacks a fleet. In order to solve FSD for EVERY city, you need massive amounts of data. Tesla's fleet is generating data as we speak.

Next year we are going to start to see the wave of Lease returns. What the hell is TSLA going to do in 2024 when they have to take back 100,000 3 year old cars. They will be holding old inventory they will never be able to love. Logistics alone on storing 100s of thousands of leased vehicles is going to CRUSH TSLA. 

Once they start producing more cars then they actually sell (which eventually all major manufacturers do) their margins will shrink. As their margins shrink they will start to trade like a car company. 1X sales.

Nokia | 461,000,000 | $40b | $86

Where OP has erred in their due diligence is:

- Market cap is forward looking, not backward looking. The market is valuing Tesla selling millions of vehicles within a few short years - not the half a million Teslas they managed to sell in 2020 despite a global pandemic.
- GM's value as a company isn't actually $83b, [it's $177b (Enterprise Value)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GM/key-statistics/).

- Tesla has unique advantages, with a widening gap to other carmakers: 5 years ago Tesla had maybe a 3 years advantage. Today they have more than 5 years competitive advantage.

- [Tesla owns 79% of the EV market in the US](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-officially-decimates-us-ev-market/) - an unprecedented dominance in the auto market for the last ~100 years. The market will, cautiously, price in quasi-monopoly market advantages when valuing Tesla.

Tesla is targeting markets that are an order of magnitude larger than Apple. If they succeed, Tesla's valuation could easily exceed $10t.

832,TSLA," Yeah, and to demonstrate OP's biggest flaw in due diligence it makes sense to repeat a similar ""market cap per sales"" analysis with Nokia from 2010:

Company | 2010 phone sales, units | market cap | market cap per unit sold
---|---|----|----|----
Nokia | 461,000,000 | $40b | $86
Apple | 40,000,000 | $300b | $7,500

So clearly in 2010 AAPL was hugely overvalued and NOK was hugely undervalued, which means you'd have earned a fortune shorting AAPL and buying NOK ... wait a minute. 🤔

Where OP has erred in their due diligence is:

- Market cap is forward looking, not backward looking. The market is valuing Tesla selling millions of vehicles within a few short years - not the half a million Teslas they managed to sell in 2020 despite a global pandemic.
- GM's value as a company isn't actually $83b, [it's $177b (Enterprise Value)](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GM/key-statistics/). Shareholders only own about half of the company - claims against the other half are held by bond holders. Details matter, investment thesis calculations being 2x off matter a lot. 
- Tesla has unique advantages, with a widening gap to other carmakers: 5 years ago Tesla had maybe a 3 years advantage. Today they have more than 5 years competitive advantage. Those 5 years of competitive advantage was recently estimated by Pulitzer price winner auto journalist Dan Neil in the Wall Street Journal: [**""So when I say the ID.4 is five years behind the comparable Tesla, it’s not because I’m an Elon fanboy, a VW hater, or that I have anything to gain or lose personally.

I was comparing **Nokia** to Apple.

Comparing Tesla to Apple can be done, but it would be imperfect, because Tesla's target markets are ~30x larger than Apple's target markets.

So in many ways it's an apples to oranges comparison.

But yeah, we can think of Tesla as selling $40,000+ ""iPhones on wheels"", and scale everything up.

>A more apt comparison from yesteryear might be Cisco..

CSCO is primarily active in the networking switch market, which is only $0.03t/year. Unfortunately they reached saturation in that market at around the year 2000, when the Internet bubble collapsed.

There's literally a factor of 1,000 difference between the size of the target markets Cisco and Tesla are growing into ... 🤦

I own these stocks but though index funds. I just don’t know how much more gains you can have on a 2 trillion dollar company. During the Dot com bubble MSFT reached a market cap just over $560 billion, adjusting for inflation thats about $950 billion in today’s money.

For instance if you're holding 500 shares of AAPL lets say and it's been moving sideways for 6 months (small gains here and there equaled by small losses here  and there) you can ""short"" the stock by lending out the 500 shares you own.  This is selling covered calls (a form of shorting in the near term when you think the price will not go up).  You're lending your shares to somebody who thinks the stock price will go up for a premium.  If your right and it doesn't go up, you receive a premium for lending the shares, if your wrong, you sell your shares for the predetermined price (which you should set at a price your comfortable with taking a profit at).  It's a way to earn passive income on owning a stock in a stagnant market.  Obviously the risk here is that  you're underlying stock drops significantly in price and your stuck in your option contract (i.e. you cant sell it).
