0,AMZN," AMZN is my 3rd largest single stock position. This stock is hard to value because it's not a pure play, but I'm pretty sure the business will spin off retail, prime video etc at some point over the next decade. Stock split is inevitable too.

16,WTI," You should not mix the idea of an emergency fund and a dry powder fund. What if the market shifts, you put your dry powder in, and get a cancer diagnosis / lose your job / meteorite obliterates your house the next day? They need to be two completely independent piles of money.

I have my emergency ""oh shit"" money in a very boring savings account that I can access through my bank or ATM this instant.

I have a dry powder MM fund in both my taxable brokerage and in my IRAs, and I try to maintain some cash in them to take advantage of black swan events. Last March when the pandemic hit and WTI went negative I made a big move into USL that paid off handsomely.

How much you have in long term investments vs. how much you keep as dry powder really is up to individual temperament. Dry powder may not earn you much, but might be invaluable in taking advantage of black swan events. At the same time, if those black swan events don't come, that cash may be sitting in a MM earning fuck all. 

TL;DR - I was happy to have a shitload of cash available to take advantage of shifts due to the pandemic, but now we're back to ""normal"", everyone needs to make a personal judgement on how much powder to hold in cash/MM.

8. My self employed situation is super unstable. I'm not sure how well it will recover from covid. So far not looking good. 

Basically, I'm sick of work. I've hated it ever since my first job at 17 working at Circuit City. I want to live in a quiet, safe rural town with lots of hiking nearby and travel around with a camper hiking and exploring the wilderness while playing video games. I have 0 ambition outside of that. This is the type of life that makes me happiest. The reason I have so much saved is because I've pretty much lived that life for 10 years and expenses are low because of it. I just like cheap travel and gaming. 

How can I get to around 20k passive income and just do this forever? I've considered picking up a car sales job since I'm great in sales and just grinding out a few hundred more grand to invest or buy rental properties with, but i'd rather not manage rental properties so I'd need a company to do it and they take a cut.

21,APR," Background: I'm 35, live in the USA (Georgia), have a job that pays >$150K/year. Married, two kids, wife doesn't work. Mortgage (2 years into a 15-year with a 2.8something% APR), two car loans (one 1.5% APR with a year to go, one 0% with four years to go), no other debts. Luckiest guy on earth yada yada. The income is almost enough to distract me from the trainwreck that is my personal life.

Anyway.

The income is far enough beyond our lifestyle that I've got a lot stored up in savings (over $150K). I don't want to put it in a retirement fund because there's a pretty nice pension plan where I work, and because there are some big expenses long before then I want to cover (schools in our area suck, so we're planning on private school when the kids are old enough). But I obviously don't want to just drop it in savings because the interest rate is like 0.25%/year.

I'm just looking for the laziest, safest place to put it that keeps it reasonably accessible. I'm not looking to make a big gamble or anything, I just want to keep the money from losing its value. (And making money wouldn't be bad, but I don't want to take any big risks.) I've got a 529 plan for each kid that I put $8K/year in because that's the limit of Georgia's state income tax deduction for that.

My current plan is to throw it in a bunch of index funds. I've picked out a handful and plan to split it pretty evenly between them: probably 50% into funds that track the major exchanges (leaning QQQ and IVV), then the other 50% spread around some more value/growth-oriented indices and some market areas I'm just passionate or optimistic about (clean energy, battery technology, robotics). Then I plan to just let it sit there until I eventually need the money.

My alternatives were to put it in a Roth IRA, but retirement isn't what I'm interested in; to put more in the 529, but I haven't been terribly impressed at its growth rate (for whatever reason, ours dropped more than average when the market dropped, but hasn't recovered as much as other investments I have—but we have little transparency into how that money is allocated, too); or to actually pay a financial adviser to do this for me, but I don't know anyone and I've heard enough horror stories to not know who to trust, and it seems like nowadays there's enough direct access that it might not be necessary.

23,BB," 35 year old, divorced father of three. I'm new to investing strategies and wanted to make sure I am taking full advantage of everything I can. When I got my first job out of college, my manager told me to put as much as I could into my 401k. I grew up relatively poor, so maintaining that lifestyle making pretty good money helped put a lot away.

Goals:
Musts:

Hit $240k in 529 College Funds in 12 years.

Not have excess cash sitting around.

No day trading, no real estate investments.

Wants:

Retire at 57 and not pay unnecessary taxes.

Setup funds for children.

Salary

Current Salary: ~$106,000; company match 5%, investing $17,500 annually into 401k. (I capped it when it was $17,500 and never increased). Total retirement annual contributions: $22,750.

I'm switching jobs in a month to $148,000, 15% company contribution and will up my contributions to $19,500. Total Retirement annual contribution: $41,700. I'll get paid out for my leave from previous job, estimating ~$14k lump sum pre-tax.

Account balances

~$485k in 401k. [Quick math, at $41,700 annual contributions, this will be $5.3M/3.7M/2.6M when I turn 57 with 8/6/4% interest].

~$52k across the kids' 529s. Divorce states I'll be liable for half the children's 4 year college cost for a particular school, I'm currently estimating I'll need ~$80k per child, so $240k starting in 12 years (spread out across 4 years tuition). I'm currently only dumping $50 a month into each account while I'm paying for daycare, but will be increasing that soon when the kids enter school. I've made some lump sum deposits when I've been able to (to explain the 52k current value). I have not been impressed with this, its managed through T.Rowe and my rate of return has been 4.8% annually since inception.

Made ~$80k doing dumb stuff with GME and BB earlier this year, lost it back down to about $30k before I got out and vowed to stay away from that insanity.

~$100k currently in checking account. This and the down-payment was the money I was playing around with GME and BB with earlier, has been sitting in checking account while I bought the house.

Will get a ~$16k/year pension when I hit 62.

I put $5k/year into a childcare FSA. I just saw this was increased to $10,500, so I'll be maxing that out.

Debts

Just bought a house with girlfriend, monthly cost is ~$2400 at 2.99%, put $120k down (somewhat necessary in this market). Owe $450k. I do woodworking as a side hustle/hobby and will probably spend ~$5k on wood for housing upgrades (built-ins/closets). I also estimate spending another few thousand on furnishing the house. Costs are split with girlfriend.

No debts other than the mortgage. Child support will kick in when I change jobs, estimating ~$400/month (obviously not split with girlfriend).

I currently drive a beat up old van. I'll drive it into the ground, but I'm expecting to need to replace that at some point in the next 5 years. I'll buy another beater van, but even they cost in the $10-$15k range and will want to pay cash.

There will probably be a wedding at some point in the future, but it will be small and will be minimal (<$5k) cost.

Questions

Just opened up a Vanguard account (I used Schwab for the day trading). I believe the play is to dump a significant portion of my checking into Vanguard's S&P 500 ETF. I have to pay taxes on the capital gains from the day-trading, so my current plan is to put $60k into Vanguard and leaving ~$30k after taxes in my bank account. I don't want to think about investing anymore, I want to dump it and forget it. With my new salary, the plan will be to put $1000 a month into the Vanguard account, increase the kids 529 plans to $500 each ($1500/month) and put $1625/month (19,500/12) into the 401k.

1) Does this make the most sound investment strategy? Am I missing any tax advantaged stuff?

2) Is VOO the recommended Vanguard fund?

3) In 12 years, I believe I can take out up to my investment contributions tax-free from vanguard to start paying the kids college funds or get them a car or something. So assuming I can maintain the 1k deposit/month, that is $1000 * 12 months * 12 years = $144k tax free, correct?

4) Can somebody explain what a backdoor Roth is and why it is so recommended? Is this something I should do?

5) The speculative math for the 529s is at 5% rate of return and $1500/month, I'll hit my required $180k in about 6 years. At that point, the kids will be old enough to start some form of working (mowing grass or things like that) which I believe means I can start a ""custodial Roth IRA""? Then I can stop contributions towards the 529 and put them in the Roth? Is that the best investment strategy for the children (considering my divorce requirement)? Can I start contributing to the custodial roths before they earn income?

6) Looking pretty far ahead to retiring at 57, I believe you can start pulling from your 401k (from current company) at 55 without paying the 10% penalty. Assuming I am able to contribute routinely to the vanguard fund, I could use the amount I've deposited over the years to cover me until the penalty doesn't exist? (This is similar to question 3). What does the 'retirement age is 66 and 10 months' or '62 for reduced benefits' mean? Am I missing something that would prevent me from retiring before either of those ages?

7) A bit less further away, but what other funds can i start for my children once their college funds are paid for and if possible I max out their Roths? Some compounding interest account that they could use for the purchase of a house or to start their children's college fund? Starting a wedding fund for my children?

5) The speculative math for the 529s is at 5% rate of return and $1500/month, I'll hit my required $180k in about 6 years. At that point, the kids will be old enough to start some form of working (mowing grass or things like that) which I believe means I can start a ""custodial Roth IRA""? Then I can stop contributions towards the 529 and put them in the Roth? Is that the best investment strategy for the children (considering my divorce requirement)? Can I start contributing to the custodial roths before they earn income?

6) Looking pretty far ahead to retiring at 57, I believe you can start pulling from your 401k (from current company) at 55 without paying the 10% penalty. Assuming I am able to contribute routinely to the vanguard fund, I could use the amount I've deposited over the years to cover me until the penalty doesn't exist? (This is similar to question 3). What does the 'retirement age is 66 and 10 months' or '62 for reduced benefits' mean? Am I missing something that would prevent me from retiring before either of those ages?

7) A bit less further away, but what other funds can i start for my children once their college funds are paid for and if possible I max out their Roths? Some compounding interest account that they could use for the purchase of a house or to start their children's college fund? Starting a wedding fund for my children?

38,GM," JNJ - but you may be better served with an ETF.

I don't like the automotive sector in general.  What makes you think that GM is a better play and will gain a bigger market share in the future? Their EV's? You've got Ford, Volkswagen and others switching to EVs.  Toyota with Hydrogen fuel cells. Tesla trying to squeeze in and carve out their share of the market too. What happens if the Apple car comes to market? Honda, Chrysler, Hyundai?

Not saying GM will fail per se, but I don't see them standing out from their competition or outperforming the market.  

As for JNJ, what has you interested? I don't have an opinion personally, but my broker gives them an overweight rating, there are several analysts with buy ratings on JNJ and bullish price targets ($204 is the highest I saw).
