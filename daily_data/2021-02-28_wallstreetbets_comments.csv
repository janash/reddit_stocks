196,GME," This is hands down the dumbest thing I‚Äôve ever seen! You can call it balls but even if you cash out with 1.7 mil you will lose it all within 5 years bc anyone who makes a decision like that has serious problems. Unless, 25k is like a drop in the bucket for you? I don‚Äôt know your situation, but let‚Äôs assume it‚Äôs a significant amount for you. Perhaps life altering if you lose it? Use your head man! Take your 25 k and at least do something sensible. For example you coulda taken $16,700 and out it on those same options... taken the rest ($8,300) and just bought GME stock. If it gets to $800 you‚Äôve made $1.2mil on your two orders. If it falls short you still have the stock and can get your money back if it just reaches $300 per share!!!! This is sheer stupidity. Good luck. I honestly hope you hit it and then have a dramatic change in your decision making.

Anyways, my goal is to educate. If you have a differing opinion please explain it instead of tearing people down so we can all learn and grow together!

Maybe I am a little naive and innocent to believe we are here to support one another and that we all want to prosper together... Maybe. BUT that won‚Äôt stop me from trying!

Yes. 

What if you get hate?

There‚Äôs more positivity here than hate. 

Special Thank you to those of you also answering peoples questions about the stock and how to get in! This is why the stock will surge again! If we teach people how to invest more wisely it will reduce the need to paper hand for %20-%200 and cash out options at 500%-1000%+ so they can buy more shares!

Maybe some don‚Äôt want this. I dunno. But I want to find out so we move forward again!

Right now, as you said even if I buy a call at 20 or 30 or 40 strike price (expriring, say, April 16), the premium makes it so that price has to go over 100-105 to get me some earnings. This is about the same as owning stock. So, excluding the relatively higher acquisition capital required to actually buy the equivalent stock corresponding to an options contract, is there any other advantage? I mean, if the stock does not rocket by then and it just meanders back to 50 or 60 or anything below 100, then the options expire worthless. At least owning the stock won't completely obliterate the capital.  In any case, it is now an expensive play either way. An April 16 20c costs $80.23 and it only gets worse from there, basically the pricing is all over the place and pretty crazy. So if I have to spend 8k to buy options, why not spend 10k and buy the same number of stocks? Just trying to understand all of this. Go easy if I'm being retarded.

394,GME," In theory, it could, as it breaks down to a supply and demand. The 'issue' is, that everyone that is holding a position in GME has their own *life changing value*. For some involved, the price hitting 10k per share wouldn't change much in their life as they've already got a million+ in their account(s), so they've got less to worry about in regards to the volatility of the price. 

Whereas someone that makes 40-50k a year and lives paycheck to paycheck, being able to turn 2k (savings) into 30k is potentially life changing.

It's all about perspective, and based on the net worth range of investors involved, if the price hit anywhere north of 1k per share, there would be a lot of sell-off, in my opinion. How much the sell-off of the 'little guys' (someone owning a few shares/contracts) would actually affect the price is unknown.

Market manipulation was rampant, only allowing people to sell and not buy, raising margin requirements, forcing positions to be closed and driving the price down.

 I saw a very similar thing happened in 2011 when Silver and Gold Hit all time highs, and they raised margin requirements on SLV AND GLD many times over in order to suppress the price and force people to close positions and it worked, That combined with the FEDS quantitative easing, buying mortgage backed securities to keep interest rates low and money cheap, encouraging spending, to give this false illusion that the economy is fine and running on all cylinders.... 

Anyway no one can know for certain if the hedge funds have been buying call positions to cover their shorts, I‚Äôm almost certain they are, however it might not just be the hedge funds that are shorting the stocks any longer.

I feel like a lot more retail investors also started shorting these stocks just as much as the people who are buying them, and one thing is for certain stock can go infinitely higher but it only can go so low, plus with all the exposure all over the Internet, television, news outlets over the past 2 months talking about these meme stocks being a joke, they might as well just be encouraging regular retail investors on TV to short these (MEME) companies and capitalize on the retail investor shorting this time while holding and adding to long positions themselves hence possibly screwing over the retail investor in the opposite direction this time. 

Again this is all speculation but there‚Äôs a lot of short interest still in these stocks and it‚Äôs coming from somebody and we can capitalize on it again.

Look for more sources, preferably for ones that published their article BEFORE the whole GME thing started. But most importantly, it you actually don‚Äôt understand it then DO NOT ENGAGE WITH IT.

Honestly, trading on margin/leverage without understanding the underlying risk is pretty stupid. You can amplify your losses by quite a lot (gains too, obviously).

411,GME," People actually rarely exercise options. Since most are on margin. That's the whole reason gamestop is just a big deal. As the whole market works with like just 1% real money, rest is borrowed.

The higher or rather the more unreasonable the strike price, the more price movement, as in more tendies and the cheaper they are. 

I doubt brokers have even 10% of the calls covered.

The important part of all this is that when shorts squeeze, the value is rising because the shorts are buying to close their positions. Nothing else can affect the price as quickly as they can because of the rules of supply and demand. Their demand is guaranteed at the right price, and if we take away as much supply as possible.... well, they just want it that much more.

You have a toggle when you log in that can be real money or paper money. Start it at paper money and get the feel for it. You can play around and make trades using fake money to see how it works. It's a pretty slick program, not only for options trading. 

You need to apply for options trading. You can find it by going to the client services tab, then my profile, then general. You can see on the right hand side what you are approved for, and what you can apply for. To the right of options trading, click apply. You'll need to watch a few minutes of videos first and update your fiancial info with them.

If you promise to sell but don't have any stonk to sell when the guy you made the promise to shows up to collect you are fuked and will likely suck banana peels for the remainder of your life at the zoo.

In one of these options there is *unlimited* risk and since apes don't have unlimited monneys some choose to die if they did the wrong presses on the RH game.

This is the case when if for example you promise to sell me 100 000 GME stonks for 50 buck each and they end up costing 800 buck each. If I can pay 50 buck per stock I'd make 750 profit for each so I would collect while you would have to buy the stonk in order to sell them to me, like promised.

421,GME," Here's the scenario:

Jack from the market was selling a voucher that says ""I promise to sell 100 Gamestop shares to you on X date (March 7th for example) for 82 dollars per share!"". Gamestop is currently trading at $50 dollars, but Mike thinks it will go up. Mike buys the voucher from Jack for $1000 (pricing the vouchers are a different lesson).

A week goes by, and now Gamestop is trading at $200. This voucher (which promises 100shares x $82 = $8200) is now at the very least worth 100shares x $200 = $20,000. But Mike doesn't want to redeem the voucher though. The voucher is still valid for another 7 days, and while Mike doesn't think GME won't go up any more, maybe someone else does.

474,GME," Stop comparing this to the VW squeeze. It is not the same. During the VW squeeze Porsche, a single entity, held the vast majority of shares. They didn't have to rely on anyone, they were not selling, period. 

If you convince yourself this is a team sport you are going to get burned. Yes the GME tradable float is small, yes that is important. But if you really think WSB and Reddit owns the majority of the shares and is absolute in their resolve you are delusional. Every smart individual who has stake in this trade is going to look out for themself first if this thing starts to moon. Everyone has a unique situation and a price. If you sit patiently thinking this thing is going to trade at the moon for a week, you might get burned. People will sell and there will be more liquidity than the VW squeeze, the price will likely be volatile.

I don't say this as FUD or a shill. I say this as caution to people drinking koolaid in an echo chamber riding more money than they can afford to lose. I say this as someone holding the entire rollercoaster from low to high back to low. This is not a team sport.

491,GME," The problem comparing GME to Volkswagen.  

***Did we have a squeeze?***  
If you compare the squeeze price, you can see it went from 151 to 520. For GME the price went from 13 dollars to 400! And the price fluctuated in the hundreds plenty of time to get out. The squeeze 100% squoze if you're trying to compare GME to Volkswagen. The only reason it didn't remain hovering/higher is due to Robinhood's interference.  Even still GME had a ***3000% price increase in one month***. If you don't consider that a squeeze, you are not assessing this correctly.

***Then what happened in February, you shill?***  
It was simply another squeeze. You had another Hedge Fund lose 818 million dollars. The price went from ***40 dollars to 180! That's over 4x! or 450%***! And it lasted 2 days (and will last into Monday), so it's hard for you to have missed out on profits! It didn't go higher because the fervor of the retail investor has [died down considerably compared to the first squeeze](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%203-m&geo=US&q=GME). Additionally, MM were better prepared to not be caught off guard with another gamma squeeze.

***Yeah, right! We're supposed to hold and it'll squeeze to infinity! There's only so many shares, remember?!?!***  
Well guess what? This stock ain't behaving like that. There seems to be so much naked shorting, and shares that aren't being found all over the place that hedge funds are getting away with no being infinity squeezed like a lot of people believe they should be. 

***This guy is just spreading fear! Shill!***

The problem is people have become absolutely ***greedy*** or at the very least ***delusional***. Everyone here expects to be able to sell their shares for too high of a price. Even if it will reach the meme price of over $6969.42, you won't get to see it because the markets won't let themselves collapse, as you have seen.

***So now what, shill??? What can we do to get tendies??***  
Squeeze it again. There were tons of shorts added, once again. And there will be more and more shorts continued to be added. However, it will be slightly harder this time. Before, HFs were swimming in entirely new territory. They were shorting this stock as the price fluctuated downward, because they expected the price to fall back down to the 20s, but it stopped at 40-50. That's what caused this HF to squeeze.  

Now HFs are more likely way more defensive and won't expect the price to drop that low. So now we need to keep the price even higher than 40-50 to squeeze the next batch of shorters. The higher we keep the price, the higher the squeeze price will be. For example, we squeezed from 50->180, but if we move our line to  let's say 80..We'll squeeze from 80->200+.  

Just don't get too greedy and reap some benefits! We're supposed to be making the money off the hedge funds, not scalping money from fellow apes that decide to hold too long!  

TLDR: Stop being too greedy. The stock is squeezing several times, and it depends on us and other greedy HFs to hold the price up to squeeze the next shorting HF. Don't hold forever, because we're not living in Volkswagen era, sell for profits and increase your profits on the next squeeze.",MindSecurity,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lugobr/wondering_where_to_set_your_sell_limit_for_gme/gp7ohhq/,0.042,0.886,0.072,0.9522

506,GME," Here is a devil's advocate for you.

Melvin HAVE closed their short positions and are not worried about a short squeeze on them, instead they are now long on GME. How you ask?? See Bruce and the Stock Market video posted yesterday about it, section from his friday live stream.  Basically the short position buys in the money call options and they exercise them to obtain the shares from the market makers call options. If they have done this for twice the amount they were short, they have now flipped positions and are now long on the stock in at the strike price of the option.

The market makers are then the ones who need to source the shares to fulfil the call options.

However note if Melvin just cash out the option position then the market makers are no longer required to go to the market to find the shares they just need the cash to pay out which they will have... The short positions could still stand and Melvin pay interest on them but use the capital gained from the options trading to cover this interest fee just waiting till the hype has died down and they can repeat the process again from 40-$190 each time covering a bit of the bad position and getting cash flow to cover the interest.

If the price of the stock drops then more call options expire worthless and hence Melvin would have harder time getting enough option contracts in the money to cover the positions and costs, but say if they $800 strike price come into the money, these could be the bet to tie Melvin over for the rest of the year and hence can drive the price down, these could be the last ones they need to close out their short positions. They might be someone completely different we just do not know.

Tuesday night I picked up 10 stocks (not GME) just because I have been curious about the market for years and wanted something stable to give me a reason to stay in touch.  Driven by the GME hype of course... but wasn't quite sold enough to risk my precious nanners.

Next day I picked up 1 GME at $142 (right before the pique Weds) just to be a part of it.  In the next 24 hours I picked up 29 more.  Sitting on all 30 now and have deleted sell button.  I might average down if we get a nice dip tomorrow before liftoff.  

I won't be happy about losing a small chunk if it goes belly up, but that risk seems minor given the company's general direction.  Thinking of this thing as a long term investment helps.  What can I say?  I like the stock.

523,GME," Yes they tried to put blame on wsb pulling the antisemitism card. That was deflected. Then they tried to redirect attention to silver, then try to say it's already over. You Should better sell.

Next they will try to do is blame wsb for disruption, market manipulation, blaming wsb for other stocks crashing, trying to get the SEC in there.

So I expect media attacks for sure.

There was a post earlier of several short squeezes that happened in history, and in each event either the party that cornered the stock made a compromise to sell the stock at a reasonable price or they halted trading and forced them to come with a price to resolve the issue.

Edit: this one
https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ltnc32/history_of_short_squeezes_and_corners/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

So if GME shoots up with momentum and looks like it's going to blast through the to 300-400 level, they will pull the plug, halt trading to kill the momentum and prevent the short squeeze from shooting up to infinity. 

That's when you know you got them cornered. If after they resume trading and nobody sells and everyone goes full Spartacus demanding 42069 per share it's going to be a moment in history which will define the stockmarket for the future.

526,GME," That's what I was also thinking. I just couldn't find a good way to write it down. People holding short positions would be happy to pay the interest and drag on keeping the price of GME trading in a range so they can slowly unwind their positions. They could also anticipate on a rising price so they hedged long in a bigger position than the shorts.

A short squeeze usually happens when you dont expect it. It takes the market by surprise. When you start anticipating a squeeze, its probably not going to happen. Like it was mentioned in the congressional hearing, retail brokers sell orderflow to market makers. They can see your orders your position, your stoploss.

Their customer service was *great*, ATP was great, fills were great, but twice they denied me the ability to trade options, and took two weeks to say ""no"" between each application. The account was 100% useless to me if I couldn't trade options. Couldn't even write covered calls.

I am not a newbie to options and have traded them extensively in the past, have taken options courses, worked for a company that wrote and published options newsletter subscriptions, etc; I'd like to think I know what I'm doing. The worst part of it is, there's *nowhere* on the options application for you to provide this type of relevant experience data, and customer service cannot amend the application after it's submitted, nor can they pass that information along to the people who make the options decisions. It was incredibly frustrating and I missed out on a lot of opportunities during the time waiting for them to deny me twice.

From what I‚Äôve seen lately, it‚Äôs happened more on TD than it‚Äôs even happened on anywhere else and Schwab is set to merge with TD soon.

The post is completely valid in complaining about this software bug but seems to be a bit sensationalized by tying it into GME and short-selling when in reality it is just simple double sell that can happen to any stock and is easily remedied by a software fix and by the Broker apologizing and giving some compensation for it.",anon2020dot00,115,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lu1kcl/charles_schwab_is_hiding_a_giant_ball_of_shit_and/gp4hks9/,0.054,0.827,0.119,0.8404

813,GME," OK - Found the Schwab shill.

You're acting like I should have done something different but you're dead fucking wrong. You act like they respond immediately to phone calls, but that's just not true.  In fact on that day, they simply hung up on me. They aren't around when you need them immediately on busy days.

GME was quicky rising without apparent bound. Take a look at the price on Jan. 27-28. I was watching my cash balance in my account quickly vanish due to this bug.

I didn't know if my account would get margin called. I had no lending agreement. I didn't know if or when Schwab would ever fix this. It could have easily turned into millions of dollars in liability, for SOMEONE, in short order, if GME went up too fast again.

In my fucking RETIREMENT account.

At the time, I knew that if I covered the short, as long as \*that\* worked, I would continue having a 401(k) retirement account with at least some money in it.

867,GME," Well you‚Äôre right and wrong in my opinion. GME will likely go up because i‚Äôm bullish on Gamestop taking a turn to become massively profitable in the future through e-commerce and e sports etc. This in turn will  force the shortsellers to let the price rise to a more fair valuation. 

Where i think you are wrong is as long as Gamestop doesn‚Äôt announce and prove their new plans work their valuation will be 20-40 USD and nobody will stop  institutions pushing the price down to this level.

You say they have to cover and need our shares, no they don‚Äôt, because they don‚Äôt have a time limit on shares and money is not an issue because they are not alone in the game (as proved by melvins bailout) interest is pennies to them. They also make massive profits on up and downswings.

They want to make it worse because that way it would ruin the system. So in the meantime they will take profits on the up and down. But come time where they can't keep suppressing the price as easily,  they'll jump ship and hope the SEC will shut it down.

911,ALL," The conditions have changed.  


Originally the short positions were ALL under water. As the stock rose, say from $4 - $40, 140% of the float was short. If you were, for instance, 1,000,000 shares short at $4... You now were $40,000,000 upside down.   


The HEAVY options activity back in January meant that call writers needed to hedge their risk as the price rose. There was one day it went from $20-$30 (50%) and then $30-$40. As that happened the likihood of those options expiring in the money became more realistic and the call writers needed to go get the shares in the case they had to deliver them to option owners. It literally was a BOMB waiting to explode.   


Add in the WSB retail interest, the low float, and you had a catalyst for the stock to ONLY GO UP. Literally. An amazing historical moment in the history of finance.   


After the wednesday when the price spiked from $60-$120 we saw a lot of profit taking and a lot of shorting at $120. This crashed the price to $60. This is the first moment that some new shorts entered at $120. Those positions were now healthy at $60.  


Despite this, most shorts and most of the shorted float was still REALLY underwater big time. The big shorters were being margin called. As they were margin called they began selling blue-chips and their main holdings to get liquidity, this is why the market dipped big, and some shorters were margin called and liquidated- forced to close their positions.   


So then the price went north of $120, now ALL shorters are under water again, and likely some started buying call options to hedge if this thing went up more. This actually exasperated the problem and made it more likely to go up due to call writers hedging.   


So add in: 140% short float, margin calls, volatile stock, a lot of call options ITM, retail interest and WSB hype, PLUS big hedge funds were now entering the fun to make money on the squeeze.   


POP... Price goes parabolic. Thursday night many shorts were looking at multi-billion dollar losses that they could not pay. The brokers would have had to pay those. So the brokers all decide to stop letting GME be bought. The shorters go to work Friday and sell, sell, sell... They drive the price down to $200 while opening new shorts at $450. Now a lot of shorts are in the green, but they haven't necessarily closed. 

&#x200B;

Over the course of the next week people become despondent, fearful, and many sell. This gives shorts that opened at $450 downwards lots of liquidity to close shorts if they want, banking a killing. Those original shorts under $40 MAY have been closed as they were to average out with their other plays that worked. All in all most shorts are now hedged with long and short plays so nothing in particular can kill them. They are no longer cornered.   


Since then the price has went UP and DOWN a lot. Every time it goes up it's a new opportunity for new short positions and new long positions. Every time it goes down it's an opportunity for shorts to close and bank profit and new longs to go in. The positions of every player now mean no one is overly compromised or stuck, there are just a lot of players involved with different profit targets. This means we shouldn't see any big margin calls or any forced covering of shares. These guys can wait it out, or they are hedging with their long calls if the price goes crazy stupid up. They are not idiots despite getting in this situation.   


So while the GME price might be volatile and it might even get back to $500 the underlying infinite squeeze is no longer possible.   


The only real way that the average retail guy can make money now is by being smart with your price entry and your price exit. Have a price target. Do you want to make 10%, 20%, 50%? Have that in mind and start taking profits once you are ahead. All that capital you will make you can use on your next trade.

Originally the short positions were ALL under water. As the stock rose, say from $4 - $40, 140% of the float was short. If you were, for instance, 1,000,000 shares short at $4... You now were $40,000,000 upside down.   


The HEAVY options activity back in January meant that call writers needed to hedge their risk as the price rose. There was one day it went from $20-$30 (50%) and then $30-$40. As that happened the likihood of those options expiring in the money became more realistic and the call writers needed to go get the shares in the case they had to deliver them to option owners. It literally was a BOMB waiting to explode.   


Add in the WSB retail interest, the low float, and you had a catalyst for the stock to ONLY GO UP. Literally. An amazing historical moment in the history of finance.   


After the wednesday when the price spiked from $60-$120 we saw a lot of profit taking and a lot of shorting at $120. This crashed the price to $60. This is the first moment that some new shorts entered at $120. Those positions were now healthy at $60.  


Despite this, most shorts and most of the shorted float was still REALLY underwater big time. The big shorters were being margin called. As they were margin called they began selling blue-chips and their main holdings to get liquidity, this is why the market dipped big, and some shorters were margin called and liquidated- forced to close their positions.   


So then the price went north of $120, now ALL shorters are under water again, and likely some started buying call options to hedge if this thing went up more. This actually exasperated the problem and made it more likely to go up due to call writers hedging.   


So add in: 140% short float, margin calls, volatile stock, a lot of call options ITM, retail interest and WSB hype, PLUS big hedge funds were now entering the fun to make money on the squeeze.   


POP... Price goes parabolic. Thursday night many shorts were looking at multi-billion dollar losses that they could not pay. The brokers would have had to pay those. So the brokers all decide to stop letting GME be bought. The shorters go to work Friday and sell, sell, sell... They drive the price down to $200 while opening new shorts at $450. Now a lot of shorts are in the green, but they haven't necessarily closed. 

&#x200B;

Over the course of the next week people become despondent, fearful, and many sell. This gives shorts that opened at $450 downwards lots of liquidity to close shorts if they want, banking a killing. Those original shorts under $40 MAY have been closed as they were to average out with their other plays that worked. All in all most shorts are now hedged with long and short plays so nothing in particular can kill them. They are no longer cornered.   


Since then the price has went UP and DOWN a lot. Every time it goes up it's a new opportunity for new short positions and new long positions. Every time it goes down it's an opportunity for shorts to close and bank profit and new longs to go in. The positions of every player now mean no one is overly compromised or stuck, there are just a lot of players involved with different profit targets. This means we shouldn't see any big margin calls or any forced covering of shares. These guys can wait it out, or they are hedging with their long calls if the price goes crazy stupid up. They are not idiots despite getting in this situation.   


So while the GME price might be volatile and it might even get back to $500 the underlying infinite squeeze is no longer possible.   


The only real way that the average retail guy can make money now is by being smart with your price entry and your price exit. Have a price target. Do you want to make 10%, 20%, 50%?

923,AMC," Several points :
- the first sudden drop in January was due to robinhood's shady (to say the least until it is not decided in justice) decision. This can't happen again as people have moved.
- DFV's bluff calling showed us the situation is very dire for them last week. Before that many believed the situation was lost and it would never go up again. Now we have been proved it will. Radical change in outlook. 
- it costs a lot of money for them to keep the price down. Interests + initial buying power. We're talking about hundreds of millions of interests every day in pure loss. And billions in investment that are going down the drain as long as the price rises. 
- the bond yield interest put a massive blow in the economy last week. This means they lost massive amounts of money on other positions and are running out of cash.
- stimulus checks and tax refunds are coming in and many apes are doubling down. We saw on Friday at the closing bell a tremendous pressure to try and keep the price down. They had to short dozens of millions of shares in a single day and still failed to achieve their goal of going under 100 dollars. This means two things : they are digging their grave deeper every day, but also there is a tremendous buying power on our side as well.
- they are up to their necks in other stocks. AMC for example. It seems rkt too. The same kind of losses there. It's huge.",RevolutionaryHair91,55,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ludpwy/the_squeeze_is_going_to_be_way_bigger_than_before/gp632dg/,0.069,0.886,0.046,-0.6106

935,GME," To play devil's advocate, that might have been at the height of GME being mainstream when everyone and their mother was talking about it. I'd assume a lot of the people who started an account *purely* to get in on the GME craze might have paperhanded at a loss, especially considering a lot of them wouldn't have constantly been on WSB to understand why continuing to hold through $40 was a good play. That takes away a lot of the momentum and buying power that we had in squeeze #1.

Regardless, retail owns a huge chunk of the float right now, which drops liquidity massively. That's what's causing the daily 30%+ swings right now, we're starting to reach critical mass. The more people paperhand and take relatively small gains, the less volatility we'll have during the true squeeze, which will definitely put an upper bound on where it could get to.",SquidKid47,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ludpwy/the_squeeze_is_going_to_be_way_bigger_than_before/gp78cd0/,0.039,0.842,0.119,0.8957

939,GME," For point #1 I've already posted comments on my thoughts on the recent spike and accurately predicted what would happen.

For point #2 and #3 the 33 million short volume is a non event. These could've been hedged or they could've been closed out already. A very small fraction of these will actually contribute to short interest and to definitively say this means another 66% short interest was added to GameStop is fucking ludicrous.

Also, the obligatory complaining about Cramer and short ladder attacks in every GME post nowadays. Newsflash: there's know way of knowing Cramer's agenda and every time the price goes down it doesn't mean there's a short ladder attack. It usually means that people less retarded than the ones making these posts are securing profits.

It's much more prudent to invest on actual market data and company fundamentals rather than investing off of stories. I can see why the story of the little retail investor versus the evil hedge funds and corrupt media is appealing but when all the evidence is just conspiracies that can't be proved then you're not investing, you're gambling.

They ones who have made out are the CEO and other officers that had free stock given to them... not you guys. And all you did was make a group of shit head CEO‚Äôs richer..if they wanted to fix the company they would have rolled there gains into making it a better company and not calling it quits. Mind you I have lost a dime... never bought a single share. So I have nothing invested in it. I have putts that AMC drops but that‚Äôs the inevitable. Netflix and HBO max are gonna put them out of business anyways. Nobody goes to the theater anymore pre COVID they didn‚Äôt either, unless it was Star Wars movies. All of you know I‚Äôm right. I‚Äôm glad some of you have gain a lot but remember that when you win someone else will lose and some day you will be on the losing end.",Harvey092698,-8,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lu35io/god_bless_all_you_apes_i_love_you_amc_im_not/gp4ck6h/,0.164,0.735,0.102,-0.9449

Those truly struggling and see a glimpse of an opportunity to quickly turn their finances around, those much farther down on the pyramid of the P&D scheme. Those so new to investing they don't understand how to calculate risk or read the market. 

And then there's this community, fun as it may be, even positive; but extremely dangerous and manipulative even toxic. Truly tarnishing people's finances and trampling on their mental states. Abusing Economic relief funds in the hope of joining a seemingly harmless pump and dump scheme. 

Profiting from GME left me with a very empty feeling, not of success, not even of relief to be completely honest. Because the stock market is nothing more than a transference system for funds. And the Millions of dollars in volume being traded, isn't coming from just hedge-funds, it's also coming from the extremely naive led to believe that those at the top will continue to hold and never sell even when their portfolio's hit massive percentage increases. You claim HODL yet somebody is selling? and somebody is selling in extremely high volumes. Taking egregious profits and reinvesting after the crash, KNOWING, GME's value is not even close to what it currently is. 

I've been in many financially related communities and this is by far the worst. What is happening is truly wrong and borderline illegal. I truly hope for those who have lost, and those who will end up losing if this gross inflation continues that the SEC will exercise their right to completely remove GME from the market for 30 days. Personally all profits I've will be going to a relief fund for those hurt by this atrocious behavior happening in market.

1117,GME," Correct. For the gamma to 'squeeze' you need violent price movements. For example, if you have a big buying push on a stock that suddenly (suddenly is the important element here) drives its price way past a series of strike prices that forces MMs to buy shares in volume quickly, thereby amplifying the price momentum. In the Jan GME squeeze the price went way past all the call strikes, so everything suddenly went ITM.

In the rare cases where a particular share is heavily shorted as well, the impact of the buyers momentum and the MM buying to hedge on its price is even further amplified, which leads to the short squeeze as the paper handed shorts will start covering, forcing prices higher, while those who are in deep shit will try to wait it out (digging their grave) because they are already going bankrupt if they cover. Or alternatively they will commit fraud and conspire with their lackies to sabotage the price - i mean anything goes if you are drowning..",ImFedUpWithItAll,6,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lueysm/gamma_squeeze_has_nothing_to_do_with_expiration/gp71yr1/,0.119,0.824,0.056,-0.93

1148,GME," It's usually inspnsequential. GME has been going nuts because your entire premise is being proved wrong by this one exception - Here, hedges are _not_ hedging properly. There is one simple observation which proves beyond any doubt that rules and standard good practise are _not_ being followed here.

- It is known that the liquid float (The number of shares actually available for trade because their owners are selling them) is somewhere in the region of about 20 million (50m float minus 30m held by huge long-term investors and large-scale individual holds, such as Cohen). It is likely around 5m of the this section are held by retail who have no intention of selling either at all, or for less than a 4-figure sum, effectively taking them out of float. This is Conservative in my opinion. 

- The number of outstanding call options contract for delivery of shares which _far_ exceeds the number of liquid shares available overall.

QED they are not hedged 1:1. They aren't even hedged _close_ to 1:1. Call options alone account for more volume than actually exists, and this is true even _before_ we get to the short interest, which is at an _epic_ level.

The situation you describe in the OP is business as normal. How things should work on paper. GME is following abnormal trends. Therefore, _something_ abnormal is going on here. What that is nobody knows for sure - Could be insane short interest, naked shorting, foolish naked calls, double dealing, etc. But _something_ outside the normal risk management driven trading is happening here, someone has done _something_ foolish.

1193,GME," That is not how that works. The market reports volume in terms of the number of _trades which occurred_, not number of _shares traded_. That is two different metrics, as one share can trade hands many hundreds of times in one day. This is why high volatility stocks see massive volumes - Day traders attempting to play the waves trade the same stocks back and forth at a huge rate. I expect you probably knew this already, don't worry, I'm just typing it for any others reading, and to set up the following.

With call option selling, proper hedging requires you to buy _and hold_ those shares for the duration of the option's lifetime. That is, if one defines proper hedging as ""Taking actions which remove the need to go and buy from the market at the last moment"", a sensible policy as doing so would itself push up the price as people here on WSB theorise is happening.

In normal circumstances you are quite right - The necessary set of shares are purchased and held, and only _remarkable_ situations can cause a last minute buy-up.

But here that isn't what we see. Here, it is completely _impossible_ for the call sellers to have bought and be holding enough shares to be a sensible hedge in such volatile conditions. Right now, they need a higher than normal hedge ratio, and there just _aren't enough shares_. Buying to cover, then lending to someone who sells short, that does not count as a real hedge, because at the end of the day someone (the short seller) has to go to market to buy the share to give to you to sell to the option holder. It just introduces a middle man and shifts the blame, rather than solving the underlying problem.

As a result, we have current GME - Interest is _so_ high and the stock is _so_ overleveraged that we are seeing real gamma spikes approaching option closure, _not_ at point of sale.

This is a highly unusual situation. The normal rules do not apply, and it is very likely that something illegal is happening, probably something ""naked"".",IceDreamer,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lueysm/gamma_squeeze_has_nothing_to_do_with_expiration/gp7w9di/,0.024,0.904,0.072,0.9082

I just don't buy the idea that practically everybody is seeing this coming .. That's not how it works ..

Be wary, hedge with gold / silver / commodities / physical assets , and hold a lot of cash to take advantage of the opportunity of a possible collapse .. But don't pull away from the market, or worse yet, try to short it ..

PS : the C-word assets always go down when there is market correction, so when I see people talking about those assets as a hedge it's cringe worthy .. we have a 10 year history look at it .. They always go down when there is market weakness .. Case in point last few days .. Market corrects with 3% ?

1360,XOM," Skip gold and slv. PALL and PPLT are more scarce, and have a lot of utility, and chronic shortages, esp. PALL, but could be considered overbought with cleaner alternatives becoming available (PPLT is one such alternative). They, like other assets, will suck market share from gold imo. Keep eyes peeled for cesium/lithium plays, key for 5G and batteries/EVs, respectively. When the time comes to paper hands my GME (10K+, obviously üçåüêí). I support your prospective plays, but I would be sure to keep cash on hand regardless of what you do for the occasional yolo. I've been eyeing LMT and RTX for midterm, and BA long, in the same token, XOM and HAL will benefit enormously midterm as well if things get worse in the middle east.

1438,GME," So... explain to me again, why is that bad? Example: broker lends out your 100 shares to hedge funds to short sell, the price gets driven down, and then you purchase another couple shares on the dip. Now you own 103 shares, and the short interest increases, thus making it easier to squeeze the price up. So what if you aren‚Äôt getting paid the fees, if it makes it easier to go to the moon? I would advocate for more people to openly offer up their shares to be shorted. That way the dip would be lower, giving you a better entry point, and as long as you aren‚Äôt being a paper hand bitch, it makes it much much easier to squeeze these dickheads out of business and take the share price to the moon. The brokers too. They know that they have to cover to costs if the short seller goes bankrupt.

1477,AMC," Alright, let's handle your question. You said that you will be holding the other 50,000 shares they borrowed out to sell. How do you know that you are holding those 50,000 shares in your brokerage account? If you put money in a bank account, do you think that the money just stay there? Have, you heard of (run-on-the-bank), and how and why it happens? Look it up. People think something is where it is not and the bank has to scramble to cover when the people want there money. In a margin account, the same stock can be lent out more than once. If you are holding that 50,000 in a margin account, the broker can and will lend it out. Here is a quote: ""Meanwhile, shares can sometimes be sold short continually, resulting in more shares being shorted than are outstanding. See, once the shares are sold, someone on the other side of that transaction has bought them. And in turn, if they allow their broker, the same shares can be lent out to another short seller, and on, and on (and on). It is the continuous borrowing and lending of shares that can cause the short interest percentage to exceed 100% of shares outstanding."" The full article can be read here---->>>https://robinhood.engineering/the-long-view-on-short-selling-8fe3d429ca76  Now, concerning if it is good for the stock to be pushed down to by more share, yes, it is good. But, remember, we are trading against people with a Large amount of money who will bend the rules to their favor. They want the stock to go down and if they can continue to borrow shares to keep pushing the stock down, they will do it because they are still doing it, with AMC. The rule is: HEAVY BUYING, THE STOCK RISES; HEAVY SELLING, THE STOCK FALLS. Which we have been buying heavily but the stock has been trading sideways. It does this because there is downward pressure on the stock supplied by the hedge funds being fed stock by the brokers. If you cut off their food, then they have to eat in the open market, which would make the stock price go up so that they could cover their positions. On jan 28, 2021, robinhood and other brokers did that to us. They cut off the buy side, stock went down. If we cut off the supply side, stock goes up, according to the article.",stimulustrader,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ltxv73/amcgmc_you_must_move_to_a_cash_account/gp8498d/,0.026,0.892,0.082,0.8866

1573,AMC," Kinda funny when it‚Äôs up 38% on the week. AMC is a sound play, fundamentally and situationally.  

Mid term (6-12 months), the company and stock will absolutely boom once Covid restrictions are lifted. AMC could literally not change or improve a DAMN thing about their business and still reach 5yr highs just because of people flooding the place the first opportunity they get. 

Short term, there‚Äôs a ton of short interest involved, borrow rates just quadrupled this week, and had 140K options expire in the money yesterday. 

Does this make it a guaranteed boom this week? NOPE. Are all the ingredients there for a fantastic run up? You bet. 

I made 6000% on previous AMC investments leading up to the first big pop. I have 100+ contracts expiring this week that I hope to go red to green... but I also hold shares @$5.20 that are basically a guaranteed 100%+ return.

Short version: nuclear is the future of electricity. Depleted nuclear material is used in anti tank rounds and we just got an administration who wants to fund clean energy and the military industrial complex.

And similar to other metals the miners are cheap stocks that can hump based on demand. Unlike other metals it can't easily scale up mining.

1677,RKT," Can't say I disagree with the majority of what you said. I would add that to #1 people give a shit just enough for RKT to shake its shorts, the current environment has generated much public interest in RKT's earnings.

Has #1 been the case for a long while? Absolutely and likely came as a result of the justified negative sentiment since 2008 in the industry. As a result the gains in that industry become significantly undervalued from people feeling burned back in 2008. I think that public sentiment is in flux with the industry right now as evident by the increased number of home purchases through the 'Rona downturn. 

That said, I think the raising interest rates will slow that down in the coming months, but given RKT's innovation in that market it will place them in a larger market share once that rebound comes in hopefully 1.5-2 years after rates decline again. 

Anyway good argument, just don't 100% agree with your first point. I also just like the stock.",Siceless,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lunv1h/the_rkt_is_fueled_and_ready_for_liftoff_launches/gp87z5q/,0.064,0.774,0.162,0.9328

Dont behave like a bunch of cult warshipers who reject to hear anything that doesnt match their perspective.

1684,GME," You left out the most likely scenario IF this actually rockets and we get screwed.  The SEC steps in and halts everything related to GME.  No trading at all.  

They acknowledge the huge price has the potential to send the whole market spiraling as funds and brokers would go bankrupt.  They come up with a ""fair"" price the short holders must pay into a fund, take your shares from you at that price, pay you put of said fund,  and then a month or two down the line release those shares back into the wild at a set price similar to an IPO.  

They'll let this game go on for a while, and they may even let it get up to high hundreds or a thousand per share but they won't let the whole market burn over this.  $69,420 per share isn't happening.

1701,BIG," Here are my smoothbrain thoughts if any of you care to read them.

**Brokerages block the ‚Äòsell‚Äô option.**

Hypothetically possible I suppose given the previous buy blocking, but realistically it doesn‚Äôt make much sense. The buy was blocked to keep the price from rising, in the case of blocking the sell, it would do no such thing. All that would be accomplished in this case would be fucking retail‚Äôs profits, while the long-side institutional investors can still make bank, because, well, you can‚Äôt stop big money from selling, even if they are on our side. In the case of GME, and everything else, retail is just a drop in the bucket. Blocking retail from selling would not save them any realistic amount of money, it would be a move done out of spite. Hedgies don‚Äôt make moves out of spite, they do it out of greed. Not to mention blocking selling is a completely different ballgame from blocking buying. Like I said, it is hypothetically possible, but the sheer cost of making a move like that, and the litigation it opens *everybody* up to makes it mostly unfeasible.

**Brokerages allow people to sell at extreme profits, but refuse to pay the astronomical prices.**

This point doesn‚Äôt really make sense to me. Brokers make money when their investors make money. There is no real incentive for them to stop you from selling your positions. In the case of blocking buys, that made a modicum of sense because the brokers have to post an up-front cost to the clearinghouses to facilitate the purchase. It‚Äôs different with sells, because the cost was already paid with the buy, so the broker would just be screwing themselves as well. The broker would have no reason to block their investors from realizing profits as far as I can tell. Also, the amount of value that the stock would have to hold to reach any kind of limit of account size is so far beyond the realm of reality it‚Äôs not even really worth considering. We all believe GME is going to üöÄüöÄüöÄ, but it‚Äôs kind of ridiculous to expect it to reach 100k per share, let alone 30M. At 100k per share, GME‚Äôs market cap would be nearly half of the US‚Äôs GDP.

**Brokerages artificially fake outages and failures, blocking people from using their services and pretending they were just overwhelmed with the extreme, sudden increase in volume of users again.**

This would cost the brokerages so much money it makes my head spin. To facilitate this, they would need to essentially shut down their platform for the entirety of the squeeze, which could be weeks. They would go out of business. The brokerages are just like the hedge funds, they do things that make them money. This would be the opposite of that. I can‚Äôt see any reality in which any brokerage would pull this, even Robinhood.

**Hedge funds digitally attacking brokerages to cut off a large chunk of retail investors and lock them out of the squeeze.**

Hackers attack big companies all the time. Even if the hedgies tried to pull a rich-man‚Äôs ‚Äòanonymous‚Äô, it wouldn‚Äôt work. Brokerages deal with the stock market, which is one of the highest volume, highest speed, highest risk networks in the world, and they need to keep everything running smoothly all the time, or *many people* lose *a lot of money.* It would take a Russian government level coordinated attack to even take out a single brokerage for a couple hours. That kind of attack is extremely expensive, and would not have any measurable impact on the hedgie‚Äôs profits as, like I said, retail doesn‚Äôt actually mean much to them in the grand scheme.

**THE BIG ONE.**

There is a massive system in place behind every trade. There is the investor, their broker, the broker‚Äôs broker (prime broker), the clearing house, and then the DTCC. If the investor goes bankrupt, the broker who made their shitty trade is responsible for closing their position. If they can‚Äôt do it, their broker (prime broker) is next in line, followed by their clearing house, and the DTCC. If we make it  to the DTCC and they can‚Äôt close the position, we have far bigger problems than not making GME tendies. I‚Äôm talking great depression times a hundred level problems. I don‚Äôt foresee that happening, but maybe that makes me a sheep. In that case, anyone who *can* see that happening is Mega-Burry and should be shorting literally everything right now.

There is a massive system in place behind every trade. There is the investor, their broker, the broker‚Äôs broker (prime broker), the clearing house, and then the DTCC. If the investor goes bankrupt, the broker who made their shitty trade is responsible for closing their position. If they can‚Äôt do it, their broker (prime broker) is next in line, followed by their clearing house, and the DTCC. If we make it  to the DTCC and they can‚Äôt close the position, we have far bigger problems than not making GME tendies. I‚Äôm talking great depression times a hundred level problems. I don‚Äôt foresee that happening, but maybe that makes me a sheep. In that case, anyone who *can* see that happening is Mega-Burry and should be shorting literally everything right now.

1704,GME," I don't know that much about it,but just guessing if a brokerage like Robinhood goes bankrupt, all the customer records go to the Trustee or whoever is calculating the remaining assets, and the assets would be assigned to the various customers involved. If there are no GME shares actually owned by the brokerage that went bust, I assume the Trustee would assign some dollar value to them and the SIPC insurance would cover up to $500,000 total for the account. I don't know how they would calculate the cash value, if it might just be the stock price on the date of the brokerage-failure or whatever, so if the price was only $100 that day yet rose to $1000 the next day, maybe customers would only get the $100 per share in bankruptcy. Again I'm just guessing but it seems risky to keep all your shares at one particular brokerage. I would spread them out to at least 3 different brokerages and maybe have at least one reputable brokerage like Fidelity on your list.",Coffee4theApocalypse,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lujakx/a_note_on_the_possible_ways_shorts_could_worm/gp7vz9o/,0.034,0.855,0.112,0.8402

1706,GME," Buy options were blocked by the NYSE because the price jumped ‚Äútoo high, too fast‚Äù but did nothing when it fell from $150 to $45 a few days later. 
Seems legit. Not. 
Just because you put it up for sale doesn‚Äôt mean anybody has to buy it. $100K GME isn‚Äôt happening because the fundamentals do not support it, period. The people who can afford $100K stocks know this, and won‚Äôt buy. 
Hold until the earnings report at the end of March, or bail at the next profit. You‚Äôre not going to bankrupt a hedge fund and them be the only victim. Funds are made up of several holdings. You bankrupt a fund in its entirety, which affects the other holdings in the fund. If you have a personal grievance with a particular person or office of a given brokerage or fund, go physically assail that individual, but stop trying to ruin the holdings of a fund simply because you got butthurt about your childhood cultural center (read: your local GameStop store) facing closure under the weight of poor corporate management, Government mandated shutdown, and a trend toward online transactions. 

Honestly for a group of people who claim to be savvy investors you seem to be missing the bigger picture. You understand the technical aspects of what‚Äôs going on but not the reality of the aftermath.

Here is the reality this battle gets dragged out for months the price continues to spike, drop, trade sideways etc.  At the next earnings price spikes again to $150 maybe $200 because GME reports a profit and a game plan on how to transform.  

Continues on another positive earnings price goes up and stays up.  At some point when it becomes obvious that GME is a company with real finanicals it will be traded that way and the share price will stabilize.

I can't pretend to know the final stabilized price but the shorts will eventually limp, stumble, crawl from their short positions beat up and bleeding. Market won't implode.

1711,GME," Thank you.

With what you said on the chain of responsibility, I would be interested to see a model/simulation that estimates how many steps up that chain get bankrupted if GME hits different prices. For example: If it peaked at $1k, would it just be the Hedge Funds who have to absorb that hit, whereas if it hit $100k/share would that destroy the hedgies, brokerages and clearing houses etc. 

A lot of unknowns involved in that though so I don't imagine anyone has tried to make a guestimate yet - but still, like I said, it would be interesting to see.

1712,VERY," On the VERY small chance they did block selling, I imagine that would be more down to the brokerages themselves and their middlemen who are unwilling to allow us to have a claim to those astronomical prices because they don't want to/can't handle that amount. They blocked buying because apparently it was too risky for them/us to keep it open.

1896,BB," Knowing how John Chen thinks and works from the past is also an important point of interest. 

Rewind the clock to the late 90s and you‚Äôll see Chen take up the helm of a company called Sybase in 1998. Their main flagship product was a database contender called Adaptive Server Enterprise (ASE). They had the winds let out of their sail back in 1993 by a deal with Microsoft in which MS kept the source code of Sybase SQL Server turning it into Microsoft SQL Server forcing the ASE name change. 

Chen knew this was a sinking flagship due to the market share being pulled out from under Sybase by Microsoft and Oracle alike. So what did he do? He looked for a niche that was not completely aligned with the original Sybase bottom line and started cultivating relationships with companies ‚Äî mobile data transfer. The product he pushed to development handles the backend transfer of data across cellular networks such as sending a text from Verizon to AT&T. This is where Chen‚Äôs BB relationship begins as well as relationships with giants like SAP. This cultivated a company with partnerships throughout the global markets and put Sybase on front stage for a significant buyout that came to fruition with SAP working to purchase Sybase during 2010. 

Chen, after continuing to help smooth the transition of Sybase merging with SAP until 2012, left to become the CEO of a company he had developed a relationship with in the mobile industry as of 2013 ‚Äî BlackBerry.

Once again the company Chen is at the helm for took a new direction with an important new niche outside of its flagship product. Once again Chen is cultivating relationships with companies and putting new developments on display for the market to ogle at. A company like Amazon buying up BB completely isn‚Äôt a matter of ‚Äúif‚Äù in my opinion, but instead a matter of ‚Äúwhen‚Äù now. This is Chen‚Äôs long play. This is how he works and how he thinks.

1939,GME," He had bought 2/26 calls earlier (3 at a $50 strike, 1 at $51, 1 at $65). He sold to close those positions and lock in profits, instead of exercising (had he exercised he'd have received 500 shares at an average cost of $53.20/share). 

He then took what he made and bought 3/5 calls at $120 strike. He paid $33.95 for each of those contracts, so he will make money on the new trade if GME closes over $153.95 on 3/5.

Compared to the alternative--spending the same $30,000 on 300 shares--his strategy will not break even unless GME closes over $180 on March 5th, but for each dollar over $180 GME closes on March 5th, he'll make 3√ó as much (because he has 9 options vs 300 shares).

1951,AMC," There are two types of contracts: calls and puts. 

‚ÄúCalls‚Äù mean you reserve the right to BUY 100 shares at a certain price (Say 100 shares of SNDL at $2) and you pay a fee to reserve them (say $.15). So you pay $.15x100 ($15) and if SNDL goes above $2 you have the right to buy 100 shares at $2 even if the current share price is $5, or sell your contract for the difference between the current share price and the $2. ($5-$2-$.15=$2.85x100 means you make $285) 

A ‚ÄúPut‚Äù is the reverse, you pay a fee to reserve a right to SELL 100 shares at a price. So say $1 for SNDL then the price dips to $.50. You can still sell for $1 because you bought a put contract.

They always come in batches of 100 and the fees/premiums vary depending on what people think the probability is. 

For example, Right now to buy a GME call at $100 is like $10,000 or more, because most people believe it‚Äôs going to go way above that. To buy a GME call at $800 is like $5.58 a share so $5.58X100 is $558 for an $800 call on GME. 

In comparison to buy a $35 call of AMC is $27.

2005,AMD, While I am a AMD bull this is pretty dumb imo. First amd didn't buy xlnx they planned a merger and it was never off its been under review and I doubt it's finalized  in the next month. Second the merger price has already been priced in as its a stock offering and that brought amd share price down and pushed xlnx up because when the merger is done xlnx shares turn into an amount of amd shares. Also the shortage has been going on and AMD as well as Nvidia and Intel have been selling basically every chip produced. Unless they cna increase supply so amd can sell more chips I don't see this changing much short term.,iinevets,6,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lty2xy/amd_dd_lisa_su_going_to_take_us_to_the_moon/gp39y9k/,0.062,0.825,0.113,0.6597

2084,GME," Between February 17th and 3pm Feb 24th a total of 6600 calls were bought on the dark pools with strikes of 95C, 100C, 105C for Mar 19th expiry. At the time of those buys GME was sitting $40-$50. After 3pm someone triggered a gamma squeeze and the price went to 80 in the next hour and IV went through the roof. Luck, just good timing or a plan?

I would say someone has a plan and it centers on that date.  Those calls were way out of the money and repeat buys.  If they planned for it to be done 26-Feb they could have bought the calls at a lot lower premium. If they planned for 1-Apr they wouldn't have their options expiring two weeks before.

Not a financial advisor but I think someone is setting up a massive gamma squeeze that week. The option chain for Mar 19th now has 13 million shares in open interest. This week may have been just to get retail back on their side to help push the option chain and lock up shares. 

March 19th option expiry is shaping up to be nuts.

2091,CAN," no, I'm saying if the stock falls again to the $50s and you think there is at least a 10% chance it gets to $100 again then on average you CAN (not guaranteed) make a return greater than zero....meaning you will be profitable.  It's no different than flipping a coin.  If Heads pays you zero and tails pays you 10x then there is a 50% chance you lose your bet and 50% chance you win your bet.

Expected Value = (0x \* 0.5) + (10x \* 0.5) = 5x

On average you will make 5x your bet.  But obviously you aren't guaranteed anything b/c you could flip heads 10 times in a row and lose everytime.  The point is what do you expect on average....5 heads and 5 tails.  If you bet $100 each time you would lose 5 times and win 10x the other 5 times.

2103,RH," I don't use RH and haven't been following the bs super close but I believe (correct me if I'm wrong o wise autists) that the issue is that they can initialize your account on margin which (probably) means that they can lend out your shares. They can seemingly fuck with you in other ways such as restricting trading and give you far worse trades when comparing them to a paid service.

For example:  You put in a market buy simultaneously on RH and another broker (let's call it FCK-RH).  On RH the shares cost $10 each and on FCK-RH the same shares cost you $9.8 each.

2109,GDP," That's not how vaccination works, there's many cases of people getting covid multiple times, and vaccinated people getting the virus as well. It doesn't give you perfect immunity. Not to mention that the SA covid strain is very resistant to the current vaccine, and a booster is under development for that. With how slippery the virus is, there will be many strains that grow resistances toward vaccinations as we've already started to see.

There's an expected timeline for the South African strain coming to the US, I don't know what it is, but it will likely get here before the booster comes out. We'll see

The sentiment in the US and EU is a lot of negativity about the vaccine, and the magic number I've read was around 75% of people need to be vaccinated for herd immunity, which that 20% means nothing because vaccination isn't a linear model, there will be regression on the way to 75%.

Onto the economy, The US dollar is slipping, our GDP per debt dollar has fallen, the margin debt and options leverage has exceeded all historic data ever, poor people are poorer than ever, rich are richer than ever. This is mostly fine because as long as the CPI stays low people will be able to survive, when the CPI goes up (which may happen when a bunch of retards break the system) then there will literally have to be bread lines like 1929 or 1923 Germany.

Small businesses are starving out, surviving on bad loans from banks and the government. 1/5 of publicly traded companies are considered zombie companies surviving on the government's dime, but producing little to any GDP. The government has bought more junk bonds this year than ever before, most of which will end up defaulting. Commercial real estate and small business loans have been wrapped into CDO like products like in 2008, but are typically much safer thanks to the requirement for them to meet certain requirements. These business loans however are no longer AAA+ loans due to the economic downturn when they go tits up, one by one each traunch of these CDO-like products will fall one by one, like in 2008 (with less devastating effect).

Those are the reasons I'm still bearish on the market, the fact that Michael Burry has been saying mostly the same things makes me feel like I'm onto something, so I've received enough confirmation bias to stay with my short position.
