0,GME," I didn't own any GME or meme stocks - but I closed out my Robinhood account today after doing all the things to transfer starting last week.

I also closed out my Ally account for the shit they pulled too. Ally did the exact same restrictions as Robinhood did. They use the same Apex clearing house. They are just as unreliable because of that. Their systems need a ton of work too as they regularly have issues displaying or allowing you to access your funds. It is unacceptable that I was locked out of any trading or even viewing my data for 3-5 hours several times in the last 4 weeks.

1. Sell all your fractional share before you trigger transfer and move money from the account. ( Fidelity only accepts full shares so RH will auto sell your fractions)

3. If you do it before RH will send your account as margin to Fidelity which you will owe money on it - cancel the transfer by contacting Fidelity and than RH. Let that  shit settle 3-5 days or so begin a new transfer then.

They don't know what that is. They don't care. They already make plenty of money. If I had money to buy their business and knew anything about welding, it'd be a no brainer. It's a small welding tools/parts manufacturer in Ontario that is 800k+ profitable with the widest margins every fucking year and they leave money on the table because they're old and don't understand technology.

Point is, a lot of people with tons of money especially the kind you invest with, are not at the point where they are comfortable moving and manipulating it via an online broker. So their UI never gets updated.

They prefer to go into the bank and shake a managers hand because they don't know, and don't trust, the internet.

A transportation company will charge about $500 per vehicle to pick it up from point A and delivery to point B. Tesla has to do that twice. This is a large cost. It is a huge hit for the company no matter how you look at the situation. There is a reason Tesla tried to avoid the situation and only threw in the towel once regulators got involved.

Since 2015 Tesla has produced approximately 1.31 million cars total. This recall means that about 10% of all cars they produced will need to be picked up, transported to a Tesla facility, repaired, and then shipped back to said customer. A transportation company will charge about $500 per vehicle to pick it up from point A and delivery to point B. Tesla has to do that twice. This is a large cost. It is a huge hit for the company no matter how you look at the situation. There is a reason Tesla tried to avoid the situation and only threw in the towel once regulators got involved.

What happens in ten years from now when TSLA is actually worth $900B? Well, since the market share is already $900B its not like the stock price will go up?

You don't want your stock price to be years ahead of your company's value because in tens years... where's your growth?

That being said, the entire American auto industry isn't even worth $900B lol. It's overvalued as fuck both now and ten years from now.

220,IMO," The simple thing to do is to get an index fund - those are meant to match the stock market as a whole (or whatever they're indexed to - eg, they could be indexed to the S&P 500, or Dow Jones, etc). They're good to start off with b/c they are much lower risk, have much lower fees (eg: Vanguard S&P 500 fund has 0.04% fee, vs the first Ark one I find having 0.75%). Not the biggest deal, but it is a nice edge.

It's not easy to consistently beat the market, and there's always going to be some risk in doing so. If you're not sure about the strategy various funds have, it's safer to at least start by matching the market IMO. But those other funds are definitely much better than buying individual stocks when new.",matgopack,5,/r/stocks/comments/lccord/tesla_recalls_135000_cars_while_it_only_produces/glzmmdm/,0.085,0.805,0.11,0.7781
221,FSD," I slightly disagree. For one, I think it'll reach it's current valuation in roughly 5 years, if scaling continues at the same rate as it has been. 

Second, the main source of revenue will not be cars, it will be battery production and self-driving, which is why it's in a different league than other auto-makers. 

People who have or buy tesla are betting that they'll achieve full self driving in the nearish future. The current price has them winning global auto manufacturing, or capturing a significant share of it. If FSD comes into the picture, the sky is the limit. It is speculation tho, since it's definitely overpriced for it's current value",big-thinkie,2,/r/stocks/comments/lccord/tesla_recalls_135000_cars_while_it_only_produces/gm0lfvi/,0.02,0.863,0.117,0.8516
222,EV," >first of all, ew. second of all, tesla only had 1 of the top 10 selling EVs in the world last year.

First of all, wrong. The Model 3 was the #1 sold EV and the Model Y was #4. 

Two, what an utterly misleading stat to lead with. Okay they have 2 out of the top 10, but what are the total raw amount of cars sold? The Model 3, #1 had 365,000 sales last year...#2, the  HongGuang EV had 119,000 and the Renault only 100,000. The next most popular non-china car, the renault, has 3.5x less sales...odd you dont include that stat. I wonder why. 

In fact, between the Model 3/Y (445,000 total sales last year) is more sold than the other 7 Western makes in the top 10 combined (421,000). How odd, you only describe spots on the top 10 and not these underlying sales numbers. I wonder why?

Gish galloping like this is a clown ass move, especially when a simple google search proves just how goofy it is.

Your first point was that there aren't any other models which I showed you was wrong

Your second point was that no one cares about those cars which sales figures of them compared to tesla shows that is also wrong

Your third point... well to be honest I think your third point is shifting the goal posts to talk about total EV sales which tesla wins because why would any company in the business of making money only make cars that acount for 5% of global car sales hahaha im sure ford is losing a lot of sleep pumping out more f150s a tear than tesla has made cars in their existence.

This right here. The ""legacy"" auto makers won't be chomping at the EV bit until they have to. Gas is cheap and they know that nobody wants sedans; it's all about SUVs, pick-ups and minivans.

235,DD," OP is spot on with the misplaced hype going into the Canadian LP's.  Canadian names going up only because they are on the big boy exchanges while the US names are stuck on the OTC as sleeping giants due to the federal law.

We're talking about mammoth NYSE sized companies, with real profits and strong operations, forced to list on the OTC markets where institutions and news programs don't want to go.  **Companies like Trulieve have approx 1/4 of the market cap of the biggest Canadian companies, while making significantly more in revenue, profit, and growth opportunity**... not to mention *inside of a market 10 times the size.*

With the senate now prioritizing the issue, uplisting to the big exchanges is more likely than ever, and congrats to all that get in for the potential legendary run that will come with it.

284,DD," **Launch sequence has already been initiated**, it happened when the Senate turned blue in January by surprise, creating a Cannabis Friendly environment to replace the the major roadblock that was previously there.

**T minus 10 seconds...** The Senate leader has confirmed over the past few days that they will be prioritizing Cannabis legislation, and that they want it to happen in 2021...

**T minus 5 seconds...** we'll soon see a solid MJ bill on the Senate floor.  (They have passed the house vote consistently, just needed the Senate on board... see points above.)

**T minus 3**... the bill passes.

**T minus 2...**  starts getting really exciting when the NASDAQ and NYSE start talking about allowing US cannabis companies, like they do with the Canadian ones.  (Federal law makes the difference here, see point above.)

**...and**  🚀 ***Liftoff***  🚀 **occurs** when the first US Cannabis Operator is listed to a major exchange.  To get an idea of how big this is, using rough math and top OTC listed (US) vs top NYSE listed (Canadian) cannabis companies as the example, we're talking about trade volume increasing from 250k avg shares traded to 25 million avg shares traded.

**I believe, along with many others, that this will result in a ""stonk going up"" type situation.**

There's more from there, up to and including all out federal legalization - but that's the big one for me.  These companies are crushing it but are held down by the OTC listings and are significantly undervalued compared to their Canadian counterparts as a result.  All this while being significantly more profitable and and in a market 10x the size.  So these aren't your typical OTC stocks and the market will catch up to reality - once it is allowed to.

That said - keep in mind that the first two points have already happened so we're currently riding a high.

291,SP," 100% but here's another view. An ETF is great when there are 1000 similar companies, as it can hold the cream of the crop (top 5% performers maybe). Whereas now the MJ sector is so small and no real leaders (like apple or Google level) have formed yet. So your getting the whole crop, or most of the crop. And in that will be more underperformers. In fact I'd say there will be MJ names who will go bankrupt at some point/fade into nothing. 

The counter to this at the moment is good news for one MJ name raises all the names. But that won't always be true. 

But you are correct the companies in an ETF will change. But that doesn't happen overnight. Take that Canadian MJ name (I can't remember which name) the ones who had fake walls hiding more plants and basically tanked their SP overnight. The ETF would have been hit by this because they can't immediately back out/the SP moves early. 

I am super bullish MJ and I think you will do just great holding an MJ ETF. but I would probably balance it with a couple key names that you think will be the front runners, at least that is what I will be doing (again total amateur here, so don't take my advice).",Ghostpants101,1,/r/stocks/comments/lc6cnp/the_us_cannabis_boom_and_why_you_need_to_be/gm0n9qe/,0.074,0.842,0.084,0.6658

An additional problem is this has shown how easy it is to manipulate the general consumer on social media.

A market crash, in some ways, is just a chance to buy at discount rates, if your goal is long term. Of course make sure that you can keep buying during those times (e.g. save, and spare some cash for the occasion).",SulphaTerra,15,/r/stocks/comments/lc7znl/the_next_crash_will_be_blamed_on_retail/glzg1uu/,0.052,0.819,0.129,0.7684

I'm telling you that countless illegal activities helped the hedge funds get out from the worst of their own predicament; basically, lots of real data exists demonstrating this clearly.

I understand the official narrative and have read the documents. The existence of this liquidity issue, for me, does nothing to disprove that Robin Hood and many other companies (without the liquidity excuse) restricted trading of GME to protect themselves and others.

>It was never a movement against Wall Street.

For you, doesn't appear that way. For others, yes. Since you don't get to write history all you can state is that your own motivations were not ideological at all. Okay.

REad this if y’all want to have a reason, said many times before. The hfs likely bought many otm calls heading towards March to April waiting for the “gme hype” to die out, so they can cover there shorts in low volume. All we have to do is just hold, squeezes don’t take a day or two. What we saw last week was a half squeeze since restriction were on gme... the shorts are still not covered and waiting to be within next month.... just hold and seee for you self with the chart below. We will see the squeeze sooner or later, mark my words as long as the shares are held by us, the squeeze will come....(not saying date because then y’all be waiting until then

560,RH," I'm sorry but that is debatable. I'm inclined more to a neutral point of view. While some trading restrictions didn't help, my opinion is that 3 gaming apps (ie not serious trading platforms in the true sense) wouldn't have mattered much in the grand scale, because price was driven up by shorts covering and down by institutions selling (Fidelity for example was long on the stock). The power of retail was reduced anyway. They might have started the move and might have helped for a bigger spike, but that's it. Retailers alone couldn't have driven it up to infinity when the ownership was already in the hands of institutions.

The reverse is also true for me, in that crippling retail buying don't think mattered much, but they did it anyway. Psychologically, doing that might have actually have been worse for them because people took it personal and bought on other platforms out of spite.

People late in the game that invested for the first time in their life in an overly inflated stock only helped with the volatility and the price moving sideways giving time for ""normal"" trading to take its course from the 300$ point. High volatility with not-so-smart fishes attracted smarter and bigger players. Most of those people didn't even have an exit strategy. Their exit point was ""the moon"". And sadly it still is for some. That's what happens when even your grandmother says ""put 300$ on black"" - it's too late. Momentum is lost when amateurs get in using game apps like RH.

And let's be honest, that first leg up to 500 wasn't driven by people using RH. Those were other retail traders using serious tools.

I do argue though that the crippling shouldn't have happened. The way the big guys think, how arrogant they are and how they disconsider others.

I also learned which platform I'm NOT going to register with. I thought about opening up a  Revolut (I'm in Europe), not anymore, not even for easy cash transfers (just out of principle). Found out EToro is also viewed as a kids platform, almost jumped on it a while ago when asked friends what they use. I'm not a gambler or light headed guy and don't need ""protection for my own good"" from the tools I would use, especially if there is money involved.

561,RH," Ok, it wasn't the reason, fair enough. Let's say we don't care about the ties between RH, Citadel, etc. Debatable weather free trade would have made the spike much bigger (institutions were driving the price, not a bunch of retailers). But they still wanted to protect themselves and their brokers in case of an escalation. Because it could have been worse. But the guy simply dismissed the problem of overshorting like it's nothing (the overshorting is what made the whole situation possible in the first place; irregardless if only irrational players would have bet against it, the mechanics allowed for it and they played by the rules) and concentrated on ""the rules don't matter if we are in a losing position"". Losing for him is unthinkable. He's completely in a different mindset. And that mindset is ""we have the power and make the rules along the way"". Please watch the interview. His responses are along the lines ""In case of a squeeze, there will be shorting losers that won't be able to pay. They shouldn't go bankrupt. But we have no problem with retailers going belly up"".

572,GME," For those coming over here to ask if you should average down your GME stock:

Imagine you buy 10 of the stock for $100

Then the stock falls to $80, and you buy 10 more.

Then the stock falls to $60, and you buy 10 more.

Your average price is $80, which means you're losing $20 per share. That's $20 less than you would be losing if your average share price was $100. Success, right?

Okay, let's take a look at how much money you **actually lose.**

If your 10 stock bought at an average of $100 was sold at $60, you'd lose $1000 - $600 = **$400**

If your 30 stock bought at an average of $80 was sold at $60, you'd lose $2400 - $1800 = **$600**

I need to vent. I feel like a total jackass for not taking money off the table when I had the opportunity. My initial position was 50 @ $85. It’s crazy because I just received the money that I invested with that very day. It was a severance payment as I had recently lost my job. It’s absurd. I saw my portfolio run up to $25k and didn’t sell. It would have been more liquid capital than I’ve ever had at any point in my life. But being on WSB in that echo chamber blinded me. I was looking for the stock to reach $1000, $$2000, etc. In the heat of the moment, I forgot that this was a completely random event and that if you had shown me $25k a couple days prior, I would have snatched it and never looked back. I feel like a jackass. And I not going to lie, I’ve been pretty depressed for the past few days. I feel so goddamn empty inside. The psychology of trading is so nuanced. In the heat of the moment, we forget that all stocks eventually do come down. What’s happening right now in WSB is dangerous, and I sincerely hope the best for those who have taken out HELOCs on their homes, student loans, and the like. I could have taken my $25k and helped myself built out legitimate positions in REAL stocks. I just feel like such a fool. Even though I sold for a gain of a few hundred dollars, it truly feels like I lost $20k. Lesson learned. Take your money and fucking run.

604,DD," I bought in at GME at average 260. Took 1k in losses. GME was my first time investing real money. I would, by all means, be what you’d consider a freshly new investor.


So where did I go wrong and what takeaways do I have? And most importantly, why do I still have the attitude that I walked away from this a better investor?


For one, the last week or so was also my first time ever being on WSB. People. Echo chambers are real. Cult mentality is REAL. Can you circumnavigate all that and still take away what you need to? Sure. I'd wager even people that were responsible and realistic with their GME shares first heard of the stock on WSB. If not, the momentum from the sub def helped propel the stock to the levels it reached.


But lesson learned: do my own research and have my own exit strategies. Looking back, the price I bought in at wasn’t too bad. Very late but all things considered, it wasn’t a totally bad investment. But I was never investing in the company - I was investing in the stock. I have mathematical exit strategies for each and every single one of my other stocks. Things put in place so I don’t get greedy. But I stopped comparing my gains to my own lifestyle and portfolio. I started comparing my gains to potentially even higher gains. Instead of making a couple hundred dollars my first ever time investing and using that to diversity, I lost big.


I also starting believing in things that were beyond my levels of understanding. Short squeezes, over 100% short, floats, volume, etc. It was beyond my basic understanding of “buy low sell high do DD invest in what I believe in”. So I  had to rely on numbers from sources without credentials i.e. Reddit posts. Which is fine sometimes, because if they were right and I had MADE money, I wouldn’t be criticizing. But this was an exercise in being my OWN person.


So where does that leave me? Why am I not planning to off myself because I lost so much? Well for one, the amount I invested was never a life changing amount for me. I can just plan to splurge less and I’ll make it up in a couple months. Sooner if the stimulus comes soon or if I get this new job or if my insurance company successfully settles my claim. It’s to say that I would be comfortable spending what I invested on a couple of fun weekends for me and my GF. 


I also spoke to my family about my losses. None of them ever said “oh you’re so stupid you gambling idiot”. They’re all experienced in the market and my brother makes my yearly salary on his stock earnings alone. They instead told me that if I could harness my lessons and internalize them that this is the biggest wealth of knowledge I could have gained. You need skin in the game to really understand and want to learn. If I never put money into GME I would have never spent all those long hours of research of which equated damn near to a crash course in stock investing. When I think about the loss as payment for a class in investing, I feel a lot better about it.


So what now? What will I do differently from here on out? Well, for one, I will diversity my portfolio. GME was 90% of my portfolio and the other 10% other meme stocks. What I plan to do now is have 60% of my portfolio in an index fund like SPY. Another 30% in individual company stocks (that I research very very well). And honestly the last 10% or so will still be in meme stocks and pattern day trading type stocks. I don’t think it’s a good idea to be scared off completely from short term gains and tbh it’s just fun to have 1-2 stocks to check in throughout the day and try to sell at higher points. But it’s all about PROPER. DUE. DILLIGENCE. That either I myself did or that I painstakingly verified and vetted out.


Good luck to everyone moving forward. A new generation of smartphone retail investors was born out of this fiasco. Do not let your losses scare you. Just like how a stock can lose value in a day but be back in the green in a couple days, you can also bounce back. If this GME thing is my most expensive stock market loss, I will consider myself very fucking lucky. Information, investing, and passive income is amongst the most powerful things you can do to achieve financial independence. So if you’re reading this and you want to quit the market because you got burned badly on your first experience, I feel for you. I am you. But we must persevere we must be smarter rather than defeated.


sidenote: Do I believe Wall St. intentionally manipulated the stock and crashed it by limiting buys and spreading false information? Yes. That may or may not factor into how you feel about the situation. It definitely factors into how I feel about it. I feel I picked a winner and got shafted. But that doesn’t take away from me knowing I was greedy, misinformed, and was just following trends.

I want to preface this with I got in pretty early on GME and sold some on the way up and got out about a week ago. THIS IS NOT A ""YOU GUYS NEED TO SELL POST""

It's time to accept that the fight here might be over. There's a slew of people posting ""WE HAVE TO HOLD"" ""DON'T SELL"" ""BUY THE DIP"" with little or no supporting reasoning so I started looking at those people that have been posted and upvoted the most. Most have never posted about the market until about a week ago, which makes sense because of the influx of retail interest since GME took off. The real concerning part is most of these people started posting about GME a week ago, meaning that they probably bought in at the top. My concern is that most of the posts pushing GME at this point are less based in reality and more based on the fact that people can't accept that they bought the top, but the new people wanting to get into the market and are using WSB as an introduction into how to trade do not know the difference between them and a real DD.

The VW graph keeps getting brought up, but it only jumped around 500% and GME jumped over 1000% already. The lack of volume keeps getting brought up, but there was enough volume for shorts to cover since the last official report from January 15 and they also could have also abandoned old positions and initiated new, more comfortable short positions. Maybe the regulation did change on the collateral required on the volatile tickers, so brokerages had to shut down buying to keep their business running because they couldn't afford the cost to settle the trades.

As much as people on here, myself included, have a distain for the way hedge funds operate, it doesn't change the fact that they are great at what they do. They have more information than us, they operate in grey areas and sometimes blatantly illegal areas in order to get the result they want from their positions, they know the way the market works publicly and how it works behind the scenes. They wouldn't be multi-billion dollar companies if they weren't excellent at making the market work the way they need it and know how and when to exit positions.

All I am trying to say in this ramble is that you need to look for reasons to believe the other side. The market is not a place to get entrenched in your views and be bull headed. If you look for supporting evidence for the other side and you still believe the evidence supporting you is stronger, stick to your guns. Also know who you are getting your information from. If you are following the advice of someone on WSB who is in the hole because they bought the top, you are probably not getting all of the information to make an informed decision. If you want to make an extremely high risk, high reward play go for it, but be informed before you jump in.

651,CDMO," Less about specific stocks, more about how stocks work.

You have shares in Company B. Company A purchases Company B.

* How is this reflected on your portfolio? Does Company A now show in your positions?
* How are shares handled? Very rarely (and only for a brief moment) do shares in one company equal that of another... so I'm assuming it's simply the value invested? $1,000 is $1,000, even if shares aren't 1:1?
* How does this typically affect Company A's stock in the immediate timeframe, in terms of value?

Different question. Admittedly, I'm from WSB, but I want to better understand how things work and what I'm doing.

* A lot of talk about the-stock-that-shall-not-be-named was about volume and being unable to purchase shares. Yet, at least at one point yesterday, I saw the volume stating several million shares. For a moment, I thought that was just counting all shares, but looking at stocks like CDMO and JUSHF at the time of this writing, both list 0 volume (though, maybe they're not traded in Europe?).

687,GME," I transferred out of Robinhood but ran into some huge issues. Any advice that anyone can offer would be greatly appreciated

* I still have 38 Apple stock in Robinhood that I can't do anything about unless I re-activate my account
* I sold all my GME stock (cash, no margin) and Robinhood showed that I had -18 shares a few days later. Today, at the finalization of my transfer, Robinhood executed a purchase of 18 shares of GME without my prompt. I've already lost half of it because the stock is tumbling.
* I'm straight up missing $3.6k in cash balance, and I strongly suspect their fuckery with GME is related to it. (I sold at 18@285, and the negative GME balance appeared at 85, which roughly equates to a difference of 18\*200=3600).
* Effectively, I've lost all the gains I made on GME, and have now made a loss because Robinhood fucked up.

While dreaming of GME $2000 per stonk, many people completely lost their exit plans. The fear of missing out on potential money led people to completely undervalue gains they've made already.

732,GME,"  I did the exact same thing on a smaller scale: I had 15k unrealised gains and ended up making just £4k.

Just use it as a learning experience. I'm quite new so the whole thing has taught me a lot, but the key thing for me was that the situation changed, and the narrative changed.

Going into Thursday, we had momentum and support. Suddenly the brokers limited buying on GME and it pulled the rug from under our feet. Everyone was still shouting ""$4k is not a meme"" but the stock had already run up 20x from the $20 point, and now we were unable to keep buying. Momentum slowed, and we saw a huge dip.

The price recovered, but the state of the game was still changed. That was the time to get out. I kept holding because there was still very positive sentiment on here and we had already seen it dip and come back strong, but as I said the game had changed. 

Be happy with what you made, learn from those unrealised gains, and realise that this is pure hind-sight and you can never know where the top is.",2marston,5,/r/stocks/comments/lcatqv/rstocks_daily_discussion_options_trading_thursday/glyx9ju/,0.011,0.851,0.138,0.9798

746,EV," Research and thinking outside the box. For example... EV market is hot right now. The obvious choice is to invest in Tesla, Nio, etc. 

But how about the not so obvious stuff? You can invest in the underlying technology like the lithium ion batteries. But investing in lithium mining companies is also pretty obvious and something a lot of people have already done. But if you do some research on battery technology you'd realize that every battery needs an anode, and the anodes are made from graphite. The majority of the worlds graphite comes from China. China keeps most of it and sells the rest at insanely high prices. By the time it gets shipped to the US it's even more expensive, which is why the batteries are the most expensive part of an EV.

But what if there was a publicly traded Canadian mining company that had discovered the largest deposit of graphite ever found in North America and was setting themselves up to mine it and process it into anode material. Would that sound like a good investment to you?

Bottom line is if you want to find those companies that not many people are talking about, then you really have to dig deep and think outside the box.",DavidAg02,10,/r/stocks/comments/lcatqv/rstocks_daily_discussion_options_trading_thursday/gm0kqpa/,0.0,0.941,0.059,0.8948

783,GME," This is right. I'm in the same position as the OP (in terms of amount of ""lost"" gains from GME).

I was pissed off for most of last week - and then I took a look at my portfolio, and as recent examples:

\- Bough Tesla right before split, sold after split at 440-450. Recently bought back in at... 780.

\- Sold C C 1 V for 21 a few weeks ago. Now at 30.

\- Sold Tencent (HK) a couple months ago for 550. Now at 730.

\- Bought GME on Monday at dead cat bounce at 128, sold for 110 half hour later.

I'm seeing numerous examples ""lost"" gains everywhere in my portfolio! Some of them due to sensible decisions (allocating capital to better opportunities), some of them due to stupidity (i.e. the last one above). 

Meanwhile, despite all those ""lost"" gains, my portfolio is up 35% over last 4 months (since I took money out of properties and put into stocks).

Life goes on, and being grateful for positives (and experiences) is important for everything (the stock market being up this week doesn't hurt).

801,SPWR," I'll expand on this comment: a few years ago I noticed that the rate of improvement for solar & wind power would result in them beating fossil fuels right about now. Wind power would beat it first, but if trends continued along their trajectories, solar would beat wind power and become the cheapest electricity. Combine this with an eventual movement towards non-carbon power.

So I went out and bought the solar ETF \`TAN\`, but then I also made a number of individual purchases such as SPWR. They were all flat for the first few years, but now they are all taking off, SPWR probably most of all. And the rate of improvement of solar seems to be continuing on the trend and not slowing. It's probably still a good time to load up on solar stocks as it continues to replace traditional electrical generation.

It's too bad it's in the crosshairs of the shorts. I guess I'll just have to hope some reddit vigilantes come along and boost the price.",mailseth,7,/r/stocks/comments/lc3xwz/lets_talk_about_sunpower_spwr/glyb7io/,0.037,0.85,0.113,0.9118

 We looked at switch to Solar recently and our experience (not Sunpower) was very similar to purchasing a used car. Lots of funny math, very little conversation about product and HUGE excitement about how good of a deal a 60k system was for us.  I was educated on the basics of Solar before this meeting and this experience completely turned me off. 

What makes me cautious with this one is: the big news is the competition towards Tesla's powerwall as the spark. But the manufacturing piece of the company is spinning off? Not saying I won't watch it, just can't be an early adopter. 

I only have about 20% of my portfolio in growth plays like this and that includes ARKK and their other funds. So I get a bit picky sometimes. I'm more conservative as I age out of the game.

I personally don't have high hopes for AMC. Plenty of streaming companies have realized the danger theater can pose to their business so they are opting to increase their subscriptions rather than a ticket sales approach. Subscriptions are just more consistent and a better metric than guessing how a movie will do in the box office. The highest profit margin for AMC is their food and beverages so it's not really about the tickets as much as it is how many people are buying their food. Will people have that expendable money to purchase a ticket and food/beverages in a way that AMC can expect like previous annual periods? I don't think so. Are there millions of people just waiting to jump into theaters? Again, I don't think so. I think many moviegoers are contempt with subscription-based content and have no issue not going to the theater unless it was a groundbreaking movie that is must-see. Travel, on the other hand, is a bigger animal waiting to be unleashed. As soon as COVID concerns die down, travel will be bonkers.

835,GME," I bought a few shares of GME at 320 the day the brokers stopped us from buying. It was horrible timing on my part, I (and everyone else) could never have foreseen that the brokers would have kneecapped us like that. Just a couple hours later after my buy they did that and it dropped like a rock. It's obviously even farther in the hole now, it's going around 60 right now.

Fortunately I'm not an idiot, so I didn't YOLO my whole savings into it, I put in what I was comfortable with losing knowing the plan I had could backfire. It did, however, I just adjusted my strategy.

I still have faith that long term, Gamestop is going to be turned around by Cohen and become quite a valuable company. I got in it because of the ""make money quick"" hype, but now I'm perfectly happy to wait for the company to make moves that create legitimate value for it, thereby erasing my losses over time.

This is why I would like input from people who have done research, because you should know they were already transitioning to e-commerce even before Ryan Cohen joined and had brought on a gang on e-commerce specialists. They’ve been closing all the underperforming stores as leases expire in order to refocus the business. 

You’re coming here with the assumption that their model and outlook has not changed drastically in the last 2 months and assuming it will not continue to change, is a glaring indicator that you haven’t done any research and are just here to emotionally bash a stock you don’t like. 

Even with marginal e-commerce improvement with gross margins at 26% and 1.7 mil in revenue per store which isn’t even a far fetched achievement it’s base value should be well over $30


That’s not even taking into account the RC factor and plans to pivot the storefront model completely to capitalize on the rapidly growing PC gaming market

>GME and AMC fell off a cliff on Monday. Are people really losing interest? It seems to me like the movement is gaining momentum. What IS going on? Is it really market manipulation?

There are multiple factors; first of all It IS market manipulation. By halting trading in the most of the broker sites, whether to cover for the HF or not, is manipulation. People were only allowed to sell but not buy which means the volumes of sale were higher causing the prices to plummet. Then there were FUD by MSM saying that the meme was over and people moved on to better things. This is not true, people did not move on for better things they were forced to move on. So, some new people were discouraged from trading and have been put off. You can see may people in this sub that have regrets of ever putting money in the stocks. The meme stocks were genuinely rigged.

My take on is that people will be happy to have everything open back up and will be willing to spend a little bit of what they saved up by not really going out for the past year. Even if people that weren't movie goers will go out to feel the normalcy.

Personally - after reading enough of these posts and making my own (noob) inferences - it seems like there is a bigger picture to these 4-5 tickers that are being limited. Specifically GME/AMC. I am not giving advice but it kind of adds up. 

I think it’s likely that the hedge funds are in deeper than we initially thought. Who fucking knows. I guess the truth comes out February 9th when the numbers are posted - but even then, there will be adjustments to those numbers. The hedge funds are always going to be in the know and the way the laws are right now it is an extremely uneven playing field for us players.

881,TV," I mean, investing isn't really a clear-cut, one strategy trumps all. If you like the company and think it would do well, that's already sufficient reason to invest.

I just want to clarify a few things though: you are not sticking anything to hedge funds. A few hedge funds over shorted a stock and Reddit investors somehow caught wind of it before other hedge funds did. At that point, from my perspective, other wallstreet guys also jumped in long to help squeeze these overextended hedge funds. They made fat checks out of this. So the wealth transfer was from the overextended hedge funds and the bag holders, to the hedge funds that went long and the more shrewd retail investors.

The whole class warfare thing is therefore straight up not true, although it certainly was fun to see arrogant 'smart money' bawl their eyes out on national TV about how the markets are being manipulated by mean Reddit traders.

The whole short laddering argument was based on the small volumes. The problem here is that the volumes weren't actually small, they just weren't as ridiculously large as the days before. With the volumes reported, a short ladder would've done pretty much nothing to the price and costed the involved parties a LOT of money.",Watly,1,/r/stocks/comments/lc1wnx/serious_questions_about_amc/glzno5y/,0.066,0.804,0.13,0.915

I think you are correct that outside of blockbusters and special events (Oscar Best Picture Showcase, Fathom Events features, etc.) people are more willing to stay at home to watch movies.

915,AMC," I worked for AMC in the before times. The opening weeks of any release is 100% profit for the studios. AMC made their money off A-list and concessions and generally by the 4th week of release the theater would start taking a cut.

The better argument is that switching to streaming allows the studios more diverse options that physical theaters don't. 

That said, the nature of movie going is changing as well. The theater I worked at opened when I was a kid and I remember the two biggest houses (the actual theater rooms you sit in) boasted seating for 750 and we were sardined in there. Then about 6-7 years ago they overhauled the building and installed recliners and they were spaced out and they took out every other row. It cut the total number of seats, but it definitely sold.

Big blockbusters are magnets for movie goers. Star Wars opening nights were insane for us, same for every marvel movie. Any time I was on concessions for those nights we'd have lines out the door for big purchases of poporn and other foods and merch. In a single shift I'd rack up several thousand in sales on just my register and we'd have 8 of them open and we'd be hauling ass as much as possible and STILL couldn't outpace the speed of people entering the line.

The movie-going experience will change as streaming comes in and becomes more popular. It is incumbent on AMC to change with the times or they will go under.

They also failed with home kit and in my opinion Siri, who is now far inferior to Alexa. 

AI require training, and that means driving data and that is where Tesla autopilot has a huge advantage. So it is interesting to see whay apple thinks they can take on that.",mohelgamal,1,/r/stocks/comments/lcgh11/the_apple_car_playbook/gm07jx7/,0.117,0.75,0.133,-0.1417

1003,GE," Rolls Royce jet turbine engines are the money maker. They rely too much on defense contracts and when projects go sideways, they take a big blow. 

I'm in the Navy and I've encountered Rolls Royce engines everywhere, from my time as an aviation tech to now as a ship driver. They were going pretty well when they snagged the contracts for the DDG 1000 and the new LCS. Unfortunately, the past few years have shown those projects were a bust and the Navy is moving to spending more on FFGs and autonomous tech. Rolls Royce has been getting contracts, but its the small ones like the landing crafts and not ones that are going to pan out to large investments over time. The DoD's universal jet, the F35, has engines made by Pratt and Whitney (owned by Raytheon). 

Rolls Royce still makes the engine for the Marine Ospreys or V22. I was on the USS Nassau when we brought the first V22's across the pond to drop off them off in the Gulf. The sentiment was pretty mixed, nobody was really crazy about it and Marines saw it as a death trap. Bell and Sikorsky are now battling for the tilt-rotor contract to replace the V-22. The V-280 from Bell has GE-made engines. 

Rolls Royce is slowly fading away and it's not as prevalent as when I was a young junior enlisted. The contracts it used to hold are drying up and the most lucrative ones are going to GE, Boeing, and Raytheon. 

I would not recommend them for a long-term investment just based solely on anecdotal experience.  I think their stock price is warranted based on future expected earnings. I think GE is the undervalued stock in the defense line-up because they're much more aggressive in securing bigger contracts. If the V-280 gets approved, GE will recover. 

I work with both GE and Rolls Royce products, USN DDGs have GE gas turbines for propulsion and Rolls Royce engines for electrical production. Rolls Royce won't tank since they still have a product line-up and some contracts, but I don't expect them to improve as much as GE with the way the contracts are going.",RaptorAD77,51,/r/stocks/comments/lc46ag/anyone_have_any_thoughts_on_rollsroyce_being_a/glxvpha/,0.062,0.872,0.066,0.0648

1018,GME," The price of a stock is effectively set by the buyers - they will offer to buy a stock for what they think it's worth. The quote you see for a stock price is basically the last price it was bought at, but that doesn't guarantee that you can sell it for the same price.

So what would happen in your scenario? The same thing that would have inevitably happened with GME, and did happen with GME: the price people are willing to pay goes lower and lower. The billionaire eventually finds that they're left holding the bag with nobody willing to pay the price they paid for the stock.

People see a stock quote and think that you can sell as much stock as you want for that price. The market doesn't work like that. If you own a significant percentage of a company, you will wipe out the order book trying to sell and you will drive the stock down to very low levels, until it hits the point where people believe the price is in line with the company valuation.

A lot of people seemed to think that GME would hit $1000 and they would be able to sell it for $1000. That's extremely unrealistic. It would hit $1000, everyone would want to sell at $1000, but nobody would be willing to buy it for $1000.",irresponsible_owl,5,/r/stocks/comments/lcl15f/whats_preventing_a_billionaire_from_dumping/gm0mcia/,0.071,0.893,0.036,-0.8468

1040,CEO," Sometimes, but not necessarily. Generally speaking, corporate structures allows stockholders to vote on certain things, such as amending corporate bylaws, but more importantly, voting powers give the opportunity to elect a Board of Directors, who is accountable to the shareholders. 

The Board of Directors, in turn, choose/elect the chief executive officer who will run the day-to-day dealings of the corporation while the Board handles the big picture things and managing the CEO, including removing him if necessary. 

The stockholders of a company, including any potential ""owner"" with a controlling share therefore get indirect power through their ability to decide who the Board of Directors are. 

CEOs are sometimes major shareholders and may own a controlling stake, but not necessarily when the control of the company is too divided, or the owner does not want to be the CEO. Oftentimes, the owner is a member of the Board of Directors instead, but again, this isn't necessary. And to point out, major shareholders typically have enough shares/influence to get themselves a board seat. 

CEOs and other high-level management will typically own stock, typically part of their compensation plan, akin to stock options, as an incentive for the CEO to try their best to maximize the stock's value with their work.",GrassWaterDirtHorse,3,/r/stocks/comments/lc4ry6/question_from_a_layman_if_i_as_a_retail_investor/gly9wjv/,0.006,0.869,0.125,0.9805

1107,CEO," I guess you didn't check their latest earnings...

I read Besoz' letter every year and go over their public reports every quarter. There is a lot of room to grow still. On the retail side they just got into pharma. Groceries still in the begining. International expansion in places like India has still a lot of room to grow. Finally, they are killing it with advertising. It grew 67% in the last Q with revenue of $7.95B! Are you kidding me??

AWS IMHO is superior to Azure and I don't see it losing its number one spot in the next few years. Esp with Google not growing fast enough. But cloud is the only segment I'm not sure about. Given the new CEO is from AWS I don't worry much. 

As for Shopify. I don't see it as an alternative to Amazon. There's room for both. Discovery is crucial for small businesses. They spend a lot on marketing. Amazon is where most people look for products. Shopify is not going to change it. I do agree that small businesses today invest more effort into building their brand so that consumers buy from them directly. But most people will continue going first to Amazon. Finally, even though Shopify is investing in logistics, Amazon has a huge advantage here, building it for the last two decades.

P.S. Amazon is estimated to have close to 150M Prime subscribers. This number is likely to reach 200M in the next few years. These are people who buy primarily on Amazon. Many of them buy on Whole foods too. They use the Amazon credit card to get 5% cash back. etc. This is what Bezos calls the flywheel.",ravivg,7,/r/stocks/comments/lc5mew/amzn_where_do_we_go_from_here/gly53u5/,0.027,0.845,0.128,0.9626

1114,GME," I disagree with you.  I think that the meme stocks have had a negative impact on society.  It created the belief that:

* Making lots of money is pretty easy (look at DFV's screenshots!)
* It's somehow linked to class warfare (stick it to the hedgies!)
* How you feel or your personal courage (diamond hands) matters to the market
* If you lose, it's someone else's fault (Citadel, Robinhood, etc.)

On a technical basis, trying to engineer a short squeeze on an overvalued security is one of the most dangerous games you can play in the market.  But that's where the GME meme lost the plot, it took on a life of its own and sucked in the most amateurs at the most dangerous point of the trade.

The other memes (non-GME) were even weaker in their stories which is why none of the whales joined in - because there was no vulnerable party to leverage except the retail meme-followers themselves.

Finally your point about education:

**| there is a chance that we increase the amount of financially literate people among this 90%!**

I don't see that happening.  Trying to learn about the market from the GME episode is like trying to learn about all mammals by studying a platypus.

1115,GME," Memestocks will only have a good impact if people move past memestocks and into actual investing/trading. 

If all they do is buy $GME and lose a shitload bagholding they're going to walk away confused and resentful of the stock market. They won't chalk it up as a teaching lesson to not piss money away frivolously for lulz, they will see that they can't win and stop participating. To them it's a boys club & they are not welcome.

And they won't be entirely wrong to be bitter, either.

1146,USA," The growth will happen because the technology works.  The build up of fueling stations will happen slowly.  There is no rule that says you have to build every single H gas station on the same week.  When a fueling station is due for an upgrade - the owner may choose to replace with new H tanks rather than gasoline.  Companies like Sun HYSR are working on the issue of refining the H.  H Fuel Cells could possibly power everything from buses, truck, cargo ships, cruise ships, small isolated communities will be able to produce H via HYSR or similar and then power their community using a Ballard Fuel Cell rather than burning diesel to produce electricity like they would be doing now.  My hope is in ten years my $25,000 investment into Ballard for 885 shares will be worth $1 million -  around $1000/share -- thats my hope.  Currently that $25k invested this June 2020 is now \~ +75% and no sign to stop growing

Watch 'At War with the Dinosaurs'  and then you will see that the H fuel cell has been ignored by USA government for years basically playing the markets by defunding the entire H program -disgusting!",jedinachos,9,/r/stocks/comments/lcip6i/hydrogen_stocks/gm03k86/,0.071,0.828,0.101,0.636
1147,DCF," Notwithstanding the fact that the players you mentioned are largely producing blue hydrogen not green (four types of hydrogen production), there will be an eventual shift towards adoption of green hydrogen eventually, which the mentioned companies will go into as well. 

About buying into them, a question you have to ask yourself is if current valuations are comfortable for you? Taking plug power and Ballard as examples, they are still loss making, most comparisons by brokers to derive their own valuations and TP rely on ev/sales or a 30 year DCF. And it does seem that valuations have run pretty far into the future at current junctures. 

Eventually, yes, the cost of hydrogen fuel and cell stacks will come down with subsidies and increased production. But as said, it seems that market has priced some of these players far into the future. But since you are looking long term, and given the competitive advantage of these fuel cell players in their respective markets of focus, I would say sure why not.

Hope this gives u a sense of conviction. And these are just my opinions so come to your conclusion based on your research.

Those were great buy in points b/c Nintendo had loads of cash and IP.

Nintendo has survived a lot and has been undervalued in the past.

At the end of the day it is a company that has shown it is willing to innovate. Though it can be stubborn and  slow to adapt (online, mobile)

I think the IP alone makes Nintendo Super valuable. Theme park is a natural play.

Think of Disney and marvel. Nintendo will never be worthless as long as they respect their IP.

Talk to friends & family re: possible short-term accommodation. If you are working as a nurse I expect you could talk to the hospital about short term emergency accommodation.

If you are unable to repair your relationship, the next few weeks are going to suck. I suggest you reflect on what it would take to make this up to your (currently-ex) partner.

Interesting that you are already blaming other people for your own greedy and foolish mistake. Stop blaming others, start looking inward. Or it will happen again in future. 

The good news - this situation is probably salvageable. I suggest you make an apology to your partner, acknowledge that this is your own fault and not that of social media or internet forums, ask for their forgiveness, offer to go to gambling addiction recovery/therapy, offer to go to couples therapy/relationship counselling, offer to ""take on a second job / overtime and work without luxuries till the money is fully repaid to any joint savings"". Ask them if there is any combination of things you could do that would remedy the harm you've done. And if they take you back, thank your good fortune. You could also talk to family and see if someone will give you a loan to be repaid over a few years, have that situation sorted out before you talk to your (currently-ex) partner. You should also, over the long term, seek to financially remedy any economic harm you've done to them regardless of whether they take you back or not. That would be the right thing to do. Remember that your ex-partner is not morally obliged to take you back, but you are morally obliged to remedy any harm to them. Focus on fixing things for them, don't focus on what you want. The better you are able to do that, the more chance they will forgive you.

You could consider setting a limit to trigger if the price reaches e.g. $300 and you are not ready to sell. Maybe you will be lucky. Beware though, limits can be very unpredictable in fast moving markets. Another option is e.g. an email/txt alert. Carry your log-in details with you at all times. Maybe you'll be lucky.  I wouldn't bet on it.

Don't revenge trade. Don't try to make it back quickly or make it back how you lost it. 

Find out from your (currently-ex) partner if the current leftovers should be sold immediately, or allowed to run (with option of bankruptcy if they zero). If some of the money was theirs, it should be their choice at this point. 

Don't do anything silly. You'll recover from this. There is more to life than this. Sure it sucks. But lots of stuff sucks. You'll get through it. Regarding debt, if your net worth is now negative, remember that bankruptcy exists as an option to get back to zero, and it may be worth doing that *before* borrowing money from friends or family. There's no shame in bankruptcy, it exists to help people recover from mistakes.

If you find yourself beginning to have problems with depression, motivation, anxiety, if you have troubling thoughts, you should talk to a doctor or support service specialising in those issues as soon as you can ie. right away. Don't let them fester.",bananacakesjoy,5,/r/stocks/comments/lc91x3/clutching_at_straws_advice/glynx23/,0.138,0.753,0.109,-0.9798

Shoes, unless you are really into fashion, are a lot more elastic since a shoe is a shoe. A long as they aren’t falling apart and look similar to the competition, the big group of people in the middle don’t care too much.

ALGN has marketing and has a lot going for it being one of the first big ones to market. So they should be way ahead.

1276,TD," I think ICLN and ARKG are likely to be solid investments, but they may be more volatile than some others.  They are both ""Sector ETFs"" not broad market ETFs.  As a 19 year old, invest in whatever tickles your fancy, because even if you were to lose it all (which isn't going to happen with these two, by the way), you have time to recover.  As you get older and your portfolio begins to grow, however, I'd recommend expanding and investing a significant portion into a broader market ETF such as VOO, VOOG or QQQM. 

The other thing I might recommend is that if you get serious about trading, consider a more ""full service"" brokerage firm rather than a phone app for trading.  Phone apps are fine for buying and selling, but if you want to do serious research and build and manage a portfolio, you need more than that.  I use Fidelity, Schwab and TDAmeritrade.  While I like Fidelity the best of the 3, all three are fine tools for more serious investors.   TD Ameritrade might be a better tool for someone who does shorter-term investments: day trading, momentum trading, swing trading.  But for long term investors, take a look at Fidelity and its research tools.

To answer your specific question, if you have $1000 to invest in your ETFs, just put it in.  (That's what she said).  No need to put in a little now and then more later. Historically, stocks tend to rise in the first quarter and early in the 2nd quarter.

1296,AA," Wanting to break even can sometimes be a trap. I know I've fallen into it more than once. A few years ago, some in-laws recommended a stock to me. One worked for the company and the other worked in the same field as the company. They both insisted how undervalued it was and how they kept buying. I had some extra money in my IRA, so I bought some. The stock did nothing for the next eight months except go down 10%. I took a look at is and wasn't convinced it was going to do much. Meanwhile, I was certain that Alcoa ($AA) was ready for a bump based on everything they had done and the economic environment at the time. It was a little painful to take the 10% hit, like I had failed somehow, but I did it and invested in AA. In the next year, AA went up 60% and the stock I sold dropped to half of what I had originally paid. This has changed the way I look at my investments. I don't always hold onto to losers because I want to break even. If I'm not convinced that stock is coming back anytime soon, or if I think there is a better way to invest my money, I sometimes need to admit I made a mistake and take the hit.

Another way to look at this is to think about what would you do if you were buying now. For you to break even, the stock that is down 40% will need to go back up by 67% of its current value. The stock that is down 70% will need to more than TRIPLE in value. Do you think these companies will do that? If so, how long will it take? And, most importantly, are there other stocks you could invest in that would earn more in that same time frame?

I don't take selling for a loss lightly and I don't sell at the first hint of trouble and I rarely hold stocks for less than two years (I usually hold for more), but once I let go of this idea that I can never lose money and always have to at least break even, I've made better use of my money and been able to take advantage of some investments that I would have missed out on otherwise.

Didn't mean to go on for so long and I'm not trying to tell you for certain what the best move would be, but if you're just holding on to break even, you might not be using your money in the best way and could be missing out on some other opportunities",AgileDimension1594,1,/r/stocks/comments/lch0ju/at_what_point_do_you_cut_your_losses_in_a_roth_ira/gm0snpx/,0.067,0.825,0.108,0.9652
