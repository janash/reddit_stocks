16,CPA," Gonna chime in. I'm in the CPA program but I've been doing audits for about 4 years now prior to entering the program.

I did not take the big 4 approach (I do live in a smaller city so some of the big 4 don't even exist here mind you) but I started with a local small firm and work now for a larger local firm.

I think my experience was much more beneficial than big 4 route. I was literally thrown into audits (since I said I wanted to do them) the second I joined the first firm. By the end of the first year, I was leading and soloing a lot of them (municipality audits, LTC, NFP etc) and had one on one work with the owner of the firm. It landed me the better job at the new firm I work for almost instantly. At my new firm, I was already told by the principal that I have a better grasp at audits than actual CPA people they've put through the program.

Take what I did with a grain of salt since the dynamic in my city is much different than a very large city. But the work life balance is pretty great for the local firms and I learned A TON from a small firm vs people I knew who went to the big firms.

Year 1 was brutal though because so much responsibility was thrown on me. Multiple days in the early work where I was having breakdowns in my office lol.

1) upcoming patent sale of mobile phone patents - this helps to give the company cash in order to enhance their new business strategies. We are looking at 38,000 patents which will at least bring in 1-2 billion usd

2) cybersecurity - the time is now. Management has successfully integrated cylance into the BB products and are ready to go to market. They have been hiring aggressively and will be growing their market share on this from this year on.

3) IOT - IN short, IVY and QNX related. This will come slightly later in 2022 onwards and we will see steady traction of the growth when more cars shift to autononous driving. PLEASE NOTE that this does not even require cars to be FULLY autononous.

Clover Health is basically Medicare insurance for old people meets AI tech (the clover assistant for doctors) it’s a huge healthcare disruptor.  Chelsea Clinton is on the board + the former trump head of Medicare, google is invested and a partner.  President is ex google engineer Andrew toy.  Got Spaccd to the public by Chamath & shorted to oblivion by Hindenburg & short sellers who attacked this one in particular because he encouraged amc / gme ..  short interest is likely above 50% and it seems to have a gamma squeeze setup in the options chain.  

The short thesis is based on the Hindenburg report which is based on what can be found inside my asshole.

They have 20+% year over year growth, zero debt, 700 mill in cash, 100%+ institutional ownership..  ***They basically make money everytime someone gets old & then doctors use their clover assistant to connect data in more efficient ways to save costs and improve outcomes…

Fair value is 15$ but insiders and CEO can’t sell till 30$ for 90 days.  So 30$ IS EXPECTED.  and chammath said it’s a 10x in 10 years company.

It’s a completely legit, solid growth / healthcare / tech & Medicare insurance company.

607,BB, Why do people not understand that people with less money should be buying BB because they can acquire less shares instead of maybe only one amc or one gme share and make hardly any profit. BB is the buy for the smaller apes 🚀 BB can easily 2x or 3x or 4x whilst amc and gme it’s harder.

628,AMC," Appreciate the post and viewpoint. I agree, and Monday June 7 is set up exactly like BB was set up for Monday Feb 2nd, which was a big drop after a thursday peak and a bloody low-volume friday. 

I think there's something to be said that we were hit with a 4-day trading week in the middle of a bull run, and weekends really put a damper on meme stock hype. You can rely on low energy, profit taking, and wait-and-see attitudes on fridays for GME, AMC, BB. If we had had memorial day to build, the peak might have climbed closer to our price targets. That also said, mondays at open tend to be high energy tests with these stocks, and anything can happen.

759,CLNE, Amazon and CLNE signed a distribution partnership in April. Part of the deal was to get stock warrants starting at $13.49.

766,IMO," For picture-only gain/loss/yolo posts it's a lot easier. The number one thing to check there is the amount (if it's less than the minimum required amounts it's definitely going to get removed). The other big one is that gain/loss are for closed positions and YOLO is for open positions. From what I've seen, people have a really, really, *really* hard time with this one for some reason.

As far as slightly less obvious reasons go, the big one IMO is bad position screenshot removals: if you can't see a cost basis, a G/L, the quantity, the price, the strike value, expiration, etc. of the position then it's probably going to be removed. This one is both for validation and also because just a super-close-up screenshot of a percentage or dollar amount is just completely terrible to look at. So basically don't super crop it down to just the name, a G/L, and the current value.",GasolinePizza,11,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ntn8v9/clne_cow_farts_are_a_great_business_so_stay_the/h0sy9w9/,0.083,0.829,0.087,-0.0802

But I would also like to add that they are undervalued because they are simply in a gigantic sector nobody is aware off yet. Transport sector moves rather slow. But CLNE has literally every advantage over electric charging and this is going to be realized invenetably.

That they use their profits to grow and build infrastructure has been also mentioned already. They are spendinh for the future now.",JayQuillin,6,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ntn8v9/clne_cow_farts_are_a_great_business_so_stay_the/h0tlezi/,0.0,0.818,0.182,0.9239

904,AMC," Its not even funny. Out of the three GME is the only one with solid DD. BB has some growth potential sure, but AMC especially is dead in the water

Are you aware of the DD proving that AMC is being used as a tool to hedge liquidity positions against GME?

DD isnt in favor of AMC squeezing comparibly to GME. There is a reason GME apes are negative about AMC and its not because we are ""jealous"" of OR angry at AMC.

At a price of $101.7 AMC will lose its usefulness, since then two shares of AMC are needed to hedge one share of GME, then quickly two or three. Quickly decaying its usefulness and there for buying pressure. This may either cause a small squeeze or instant sell-off and crash.

However, GME is the endgame squeeze. There is nothing else that has its unique properties like a small float, more than 100% short and even Michael Burry acknowledged so.

The company issued a warning to retail investors who are looking to *buy the stock*.

They believe that you will be at the most risk, if you buy the stock. They don't have liability. They don't have a legal obligation to tell you that. You can't sue them. They told you because that's what their analysis leads them to believe.

Second, you're all focusing on the CEO being pantless. Good job, dumb dumbs. Maybe you should have paid a LOT more attention to two key takeaways: 

1) the CEO refused to discuss the MASSIVE $8-10bn of debt that AMC still has.  
2) the CEO outright said there are ***no synthetic shares of AMC in circulation***. That means *no naked short selling*.

Are you aware of the DD proving that AMC is being used as a tool to hedge liquidity positions against GME?

DD isnt in favor of AMC squeezing comparibly to GME. There is a reason GME apes are negative about AMC and its not because we are ""jealous"" of OR angry at AMC.

At a price of $101.7 AMC will lose its usefulness, since then two shares of AMC are needed to hedge one share of GME, then quickly two or three. Quickly decaying its usefulness and there for buying pressure. This may either cause a small squeeze or instant sell-off and crash.

However, GME is the endgame squeeze. There is nothing else that has its unique properties like a small float, more than 100% short and even Michael Burry acknowledged so.

Clover Health is basically Medicare insurance for old people meets AI tech (the clover assistant for doctors) it’s a huge healthcare disruptor.  Chelsea Clinton is on the board + the former trump head of Medicare, google is invested and a partner.  President is ex google engineer Andrew toy.  Got Spaccd to the public by Chamath & shorted to oblivion by Hindenburg & short sellers who attacked this one in particular because he encouraged amc / gme ..  short interest is likely above 50% and it seems to have a gamma squeeze setup in the options chain.  

The short thesis is based on the Hindenburg report which is based on what can be found inside my asshole.

They have 20+% year over year growth, zero debt, 700 mill in cash, 100%+ institutional ownership..  ***They basically make money everytime someone gets old & then doctors use their clover assistant to connect data in more efficient ways to save costs and improve outcomes…

Fair value is 15$ but insiders and CEO can’t sell till 30$ for 90 days.  So 30$ IS EXPECTED.  and chammath said it’s a 10x in 10 years company.

1076,AMC," Tilray and Sundial Growers, let’s go

I know why I’m invested in both. I did my dd. Since even Amazon is interested in the MJ sector and US legalization is making progress, this makes me bullish. Why should a big fat company like Amazon care about a sector, of there is no chance to make money with it - right, they wouldn’t even think about it. Till end of the year we should see a lot of acquisitions/ fusions. I believe that Tilray could actually hit at least 150$ if not higher. Till end of the year, of course. I bet on a similar chart pattern as AMC.  Sundial and Tilray look similar in regard of the chart pattern.

1142,DD," Yes, as I noted in my previous DD, farmers are a formidable electoral class. Politicians cannot ignore farmers and every bill that favors them is bipartisan

Long Haul truck drivers are powerful too, and current industry trends are eating their already thin profit margins. They cannot afford BEV and hydrogen trucks as are too expensive (and even if taxpayers payed for them, there will not be the grid or the hydrogen to fuel them). But regulation for truck emission is already here! Particulate and NOX are already heavily regulated thus natural gas is a good alternative 

Even Cummins, with one of the best hydrogen tech at its disposal, is saying that they do not how extended will be the time span of success for natural gas trucks. Cummins sells natural gas engines with a Canadian partner, in a jv, that expires at the end of 2021

1147,GE," I worked in the natural gas turbine manufacturing industry as an engineer (various roles) for several years (been automotive for about 3 now) and everything your BIL said I completely agree with. I’d speak with power gen guys who’d call the US the ‘Saudi Arabia’ of natural gas and it still seems like as a nation we simply don’t want to adapt to natural gas... at least not as quickly. 

We were always selling turbines but never at capacity. I always felt it was a shame too. GE is pulling 63% efficiency on a 7HA engine in Japan right now (current record holder for combined cycle power efficiency) and when I was still in the industry there was a 9HA engine in France that was in the high 62% efficiency range.

1154,AI," The company is a biotech platform company with a focus on psychedelics.

What that means is they will take LSD for example and use it for treatment of ADHD. Because this is a new indication (LSD for XYZ) they will receive patent protection.

They will also try to develop novel compounds (a safer version of Ibogaine for example) and patent that as well.

There are actual trials I have confirmed for these ideas as well from MNMD or the University Hospital Basel (they have a partnership) so it has advanced beyond just talking BS.

As a platform company they will also have AI / machine learning to help discover new molecules and in the case of MNMD they have a telehealth platform to allow scaling.

The telehealth is interesting because they can rapidly scale a solution out to a large number of people. This seems crazy but I am invested in a ketamine company that already has permission from nine states to treat patients at home via video conference using ketamine.

As you mentioned the stock has been up as much as 1,600% since the IPO on another exchange so there was some short interest for a while.

Lastly, they will try to reduce risk of failure by having multiple compounds in their pipeline so the failure of one does not tank the stock (as much).

1285,AMC," The funniest part about AMC is that Retail claims to hold 80% of shares, Index funds hold most of the rest and for a week straight it trades 1.5-2.0 times it's total shares outstanding every single day. The only reasonable conclusion is HFT algos are churning the same shares over and over and over again then eventually dump the shares at a huge mark up to retail.

Who is one of the largest HFT's? Citadel. Kenny G. has made an absolute fortune marking up the same AMC share 100x before dumping on retail while retail thinks they are killing him.

Mainly the long-haul trucking & delivery industry. delivery trucks run on a very tight schedule and currently electric semi trucks havent caught on because of the time it would take to charge them out on the road.

Cadillac, as a brand struggles heavily against basically every other luxury mark. Their Chevy line up has been unremarkable for awhile now with the only real stand out IMO being the truly impressive C8 Corvette. 

Looking at their electric vehicles a month or so ago, I would agree that they were doing well with that respect. But I think the forward thinking attitude of Ford with the F150 Lightning has really highlighted the shortcomings of most other automakers electric options. 

One of the major things that made Tesla successful was their vision for an electric car that was not as good or indistinguishable from an ICE car but was fundamentally different and to some or many, better. Ford took a similar approach to the Lightning with options such as the battery backup for your house and the power outlets in the Frunk for tools. 

To me, I think automakers, such as GM, who are producing electric cars that they market as equal to ICE cars will struggle compared to vehicles presented as equal, but better.

However, as long as the EV market share will not become a substantial part of the market, GM will be lagging behind VW and Toyota on car sales (we are talking about other 8/10 years if not even more).
I don't know much about Toyota specifically but with regards to VW group, I think you should go read about how their business developed in the last year and what are their EV-related ongoing projects. I wouldn't say it is ""behind in every aspect...comparative to GM"" at all.
Lastly, if we'd evaluate them exclusively according to their financials, GM is not in a very good shape, they all have a high debt/equity ratio but GM one is even higher compared to others and in the event of bad times ahead for markets, GM is not well positioned in my opinion.",LeBourruBienfaisant,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nthkp5/four_undervalued_growth_stocks_in_an_overvalued/h0s58hk/,0.081,0.881,0.038,-0.8402
1523,GM," Value stocks are a good bet for investors who want the potential for big gains without the risk that comes along with sky-high valuations. General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Hanesbrands (NYSE:HBI) are two value stocks that could easily double if the market buys into their respective strategies. Here's what you need to know.

The internal combustion engine finally appears to be on its way out. While electric vehicles still account for a small portion of overall vehicle sales today, that's almost guaranteed to change over the next decade. Tesla is an early leader, selling around half a million electric cars annually, but the traditional automakers shouldn't be counted out.

General Motors plans to launch 30 electric vehicle models by 2025, and it hopes to only be selling zero-emissions vehicles by 2035. The company is banking on its Ultium battery technology to vastly lower battery pack costs and make the whole electric vehicle operation profitable.

GM is also aiming beyond passenger vehicles. The company recently announced BrightDrop, a new brand that will focus on electric delivery vehicles and related products and services. BrightDrop could eventually become a significant business for GM; it hit the ground running with FedEx as a major customer.

On top of GM's electric vehicle ambitions, the company owns a majority stake in autonomous vehicle start-up Cruise, which was valued at $30 billion after its latest funding round. The long-term potential of autonomous vehicle technology is enormous, even if it takes a very long time for fully self-driving personal vehicles to become a reality. Autonomous tech should find applications in logistics and other commercial markets, and it may enable GM to offer subscription services that improve the company's profitability.

The market is valuing GM stock at a steep discount to the broad market indices. GM expects to produce adjusted earnings per share between $4.50 and $5.25 in 2021, which puts the price-to-earnings ratio at roughly 10. That guidance includes the negative impact of the ongoing global semiconductor shortage, and the PE ratio doesn't factor in GM's stake in Cruise.

GM still needs to prove itself in the electric car market. But if the company can convince investors that it can smoothly make the transition away from gas-powered vehicles, a more optimistic valuation and a much higher stock price could be in GMs' future.

Basic apparel and activewear manufacturer Hanesbrands got through the pandemic by spinning up a personal protective equipment business, selling masks and other garments and generating hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue in the process.

While the PPE business was once viewed as a long-term opportunity, Hanesbrands has now shifted gears. The company wrote off its PPE inventory and is now focused on going after younger consumers and growing its e-commerce business. The company's Champion brand has been growing in popularity, but its core Hanes brand doesn't have the same appeal.

Hanesbrands' plan involves cutting its lineup of SKUs by 20% to focus on high-volume products, exploring strategic alternatives for its European innerwear business, further growing the Champion brand, launching innerwear brands and products that appeal to younger consumers, and building out a bigger e-commerce business. Hanesbrands currently depends heavily on big-box retailers and department stores.

If Hanesbrands' strategy pays off in the form of sustainable growth and improved profitability, the stock could soar. Analysts are expecting Hanesbrands to produce adjusted earnings per share of $1.60 this year, which works out to a price-to-earnings ratio of just over 11. Similar to GM, a higher multiple and stock price could be in order if Hanesbrands can sell investors on its growth story.",2-leet-2-compete,0,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nthkp5/four_undervalued_growth_stocks_in_an_overvalued/h0tf055/,0.019,0.839,0.142,0.9972

Physically shrinking housing markets (relative to the population) are getting called growth because of price inflation that reflects increasing scarcity and increasing wealth of the rich relative to everyone else.

And now the fed is selling packaged corporate debt to the world, wonder what happens to those bonds if some of the corporations go bankrupt? Does that mean our central planners are committed to propping up those corporations at any and all cost to the public now, or is federal debt headed the way of the 2007 mortgage bond crisis, and the fed will be like those big banks pretending all is well while they secretly unload their positions?

MMs have a plan for the market, and it definitely looks like SPY has been accumulating/consolidating hard since it hit the 422.81 ATH.
