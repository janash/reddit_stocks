0,IMO," Honestly, IMO it’s always best to stick to low floats. Look what AHFI did today with 60M float and 2M volume. 

That’s why I’m playing RLTR. 20M float, Nasdaq uplist in progress, just waiting on the volume for when people start seeing it. 

A lot of these triples and doubles right now are bloated share structures. Meaning there’s more room for manipulation. With low floats with catalysts there’s less room for manipulation and more room for parabolic rises once volume hits. But this is just my opinion.",Competitive-Squash47,6,/r/pennystocks/comments/n0r5xj/kinda_new_here_and_have_a_question_on_a_strategy/gw90kw0/,0.071,0.827,0.102,0.4472
1,RH," Scalping 200 may seem like a good idea until you realize you'll need a lot of capital as it takes 2 days to clear each trade and if you buy with unsettled cash then sell before settlement you'll incur a GFV and get your account locked eventually. Unless you use RH which has immediate settlement, but who wants to use RH?

16,CTXR," Okay so after reading this, I think for some reason I have had the impression the Mino-lok was to help PREVENT CRABSI/CLABSI from becoming an issue with Central Venous Catheters (CVC's).  I am an ER nurse who only deals with the initiation of CVCs when they first are put in for a patient with poor vascular access.  But I see the merit in this so much now that I have gotten some time under my belt dealing with them the past year or so.

&#x200B;

According to this article it clearly is stating this can help SALVAGE a compromised CVC rather than replacing it all together.  This seriously changes things because taking out a CVC in comparison to being able to keep it in is awesome because it is a whole sterile procedure that only a doctor can do to put one in and or out.  PLUS you have to treat this nasty infection and hope you don't create a second origin of infection with this new placement(good chance you will create another one if for example you change sites from a neck CVC to a femoral CVC).

&#x200B;

As I just said, you only have so many places to put a CVC in, the neck, femoral, etc...and sometimes switching places only leads to another site of infection instead of possibly dealing with the original site with the Mino-lok and not opening up a new place.

&#x200B;

I've been invested in CTXR since before 1.65 and was somewhat impressed when I mistakenly understood what its purpose was back when I just started to deal with these in real life, but for some reason this article from the company itself randomly struck my bell as to what this is really going to do if it is truly as effective as they are stating it is.  Because NOW I have personal bedside experience with this and can see how this can change the game.

&#x200B;

  It is expensive and somewhat time-consuming to organize having a doctor come in and pull out an existing line, find another site, replace it, get confirmation of placement, and also treat the existing systemic infection that has been put in place from the original line.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

This will save money in the long run.

34,SP," Personally, I went with SXOOF.  I have nothing bad to say ABML just see it as much potential.

Here are the positives for SXOOF:

1 Leading tech in battery recycling in the industry.  Stated 100% recovery of all cathode material (Lithium, cobalt, nickel, et...).  Results of  anode materials to be released soon (if they can economically recycle graphite that will be a major disruptor).  They think they can so we will see soon. Their leftovers are ground down into fertilizer so zero carbon footprint so NOTHING is disposed. 

2.  Don't need to build a plant.  There tech will allow to retrofit any plant and turn it into a recycling plant.  That means much faster startup time, faster expansion to multiple site, and less overhead.  They are trying to work it into their tech (below) so it is even automated and monitored from a distance so overhead will be even lower.

3  Not even a one trick pony.  They are the leading tech for lithium extraction from clay (have Altair and Iconic Minerals) signed up already for that tech (shares+ 5% royalties).  They are trialing their tech no on lithium extraction from spodumene.  They own 30% of ZEU (used to be a subsidiary) which is a tech stock (3x last year).  They also own gold mine in Iceland.  They also own nickel, copper, palladium, platinum mines in Canada.

3.  They have Paul Pelosi who LEFT a cush job as BOD at ABML to ask to join SXOOF to start their battery recyling arm after seeing their tech patents.  He obviously believes in the company prospects as he stuck his hand in his own pocket and purchased MORE shares of the company outside of the usual stock options.

4.  All of the above and their market cap is 60mill vs. 900 million for ABML.  That means 15x and they would only get to ABML level current.  That is a lot of potential for future growth in SP.",10xwannabe,25,/r/pennystocks/comments/n0qh7x/abml_vs_sxoof/gw8agzc/,0.019,0.912,0.069,0.9363

41,BIG," Their full battery results should be out before June.  Think early feasibility results on retrofitting their first plant (in Quebec) is early June.  Then they said late jun/ early July to make final decision after everything is reviewed to go ahead with battery recycling.  They are planning before end of 2021 to start recycling.  

The BIG variable is WHEN they announce partnerships (they recently said they are signing about 1 new NDA per week) and any government money (loans or grants) from U.S. and/ or Canada.  Those affairs they have not announced when they are interested in announcing.  Dumas (COO) recently did say how amazingly fast doors open when Paul Pelosi is making phone calls (no surprise there).

This is NOT a penny stock to trade.  This is one you invest in and let it do its thing over next 2-5 years.  Hopeful closer to the 2 year timeframe.  They have gone from not even thinking of battery recycling coming into 2021 to likely starting battery recycling same year with best in class tech!  That is pretty fast, but may not be fast enough for some investors so be aware this is not a quick investment.

The best in tech from lithium extraction from clay was only 3rd party tested last July.   As mentioned they were not even developing recycling tech until this year itself when Pelosi really came into the fold and drove it forward.  This play has NOT been derisked so still very risky it may fail (all depends on their tech).  Will know in next several months if this will fly or not.  Everything is looking good so far to be a BEAST (which is what Pelosi saw as well).  That is why it is still low market cap and until just a week or so ago was trading on the Grey Markets.

If there were articles and confirmation of government funding trust me they would not be trading this low. As you know with ABML the clout of Mr. Pelosi is a big one.  For example, they are getting credentialed with a government agency that does 75% of ALL north american domestic (normal) batteries.  Their tech is near/ 100% for those as well so that will start driving $$$ until lithium battery recycling is needed. 

 Like I said nothing against ABML, but the question was why one over the other.  I listed several AND despite that they are severely unvalued compared to ABML by market cap.

44,ALL," Because by then the stock will have exploded.  I am pretty sure (you can correct me) the folks who bought ABML and got 10x were invested early before the grant from the U.S. government.  It is only fair in investing the more risk you take on the more potential return.  Once a play is derisked means less return.  SXOOF has the makings of a great company, BUT it is still very risky of failure.  Really until they review ALL the mineral recoverability (including graphite), confirm the process is economically feasible+ cost adv. against known competitiion, and feasibility studies of plant modifications are approved as doable and cost effective it is up for grabs if this is successful or not.

108,RSI," RSI over 70. Overbought. Signals for downtrend. If support holds at .0065, it should continue its upward staircase trend, similar to its downward trend. It should ultimately retest .013.

Why did it break bottom trend line so hard in the first place that cause it double bottom at the .003 mark? The wick below the candle tells you everything. It is the marketmakers triggering the stop loss. They planned that crash so that they could buy it up at the price they wanted.

If the marketmakers have their say, they will send it back down. Maybe to .0043; or quite possibly .001.

It broke the upper trend line and that's always a good thing. If everything is consistent, we will see .013 in 2 months.",UbuyTRAVELINSURANCE,5,/r/pennystocks/comments/n0riqm/maxd_a_quick_look_into_the_future/gw8evpv/,0.089,0.869,0.042,-0.6447
