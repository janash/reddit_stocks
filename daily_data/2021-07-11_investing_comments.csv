0,FRA," Did you account for cost of living adjustments to be added on top of the delayed retirement credits? Ex. ~8% per year increase after FRA, but there could also (& very likey) be a COLA added in addition to that amount. The SSI estimates DO NOT include any COLA on the individual projections. 

Also, as a side note... typically the person who does NOT need the $ from SSI is exactly the type of person that SHOULD delay filing.

7,AAPL," >5% of elderly would be in poverty?

Yes, according to Milton Freidman, that was nearly a direct verbatim quote actually.  I'm glad your gut feeling knows more than a Nobel prize winning economist.

A note about your claim about ""poverty"", ""poverty"" as defined in The US is head and shoulders above what would be considered a comfortable life in any other developed nation (and even more curiously is based on INCOME alone, therefore not a great measure of anything really), it is a ridiculous thing to try to ""fix"" in The US because it does not exist really.  The assertion that this reduces poverty by taking away people's capital in their early life (where your money earns the largest return in the market per the time value of money) is patently false.  It, like most Government programs, is a transfer of wealth from poor working people, to rich old people.

>EDIT: looks like it’s more like 35% that are lifted out of poverty.

We have no idea how many of those people would have not been in poverty in the first place (by maybe investing in AAPL instead) had they had their own capital to invest instead of having a portion of it deferred by force.  If people want to buy treasury bonds or whatever SS allegedly invests in on their behalf, it should be their own business and risk.",zachmoe,-6,/r/investing/comments/oi1buu/invest_your_entire_social_check_in_the_stock/h4temys/,0.108,0.751,0.141,0.7827

If Jeff Bezos or Bill Gates qualified for SSI and paid into the system their entire working lives, I would not oppose them receiving what they had been entitled to.  I really don't know the financial structure and situations of them, so I won't go farther with that straw man argument. 

I am 1000% pushing the argument that you are entitled to it. Why is entitlement a dirty word suddenly the past few years. If I have to pay into something my entire working life and the gov't says there is a benefit at a certain age, who are you (the collective you, not YOU you) to say I no longer deserve something I paid into for 40+ years? 

You are pushing the argument that the system is broken so everyone should just rob it which makes no sense to me.  You're right, we can't withdraw our SSI benefits whenever we feel like it; the program defines that from day one.  

It seems to me that you are thinking SSI is a welfare program, and if you are not destitute, you need to/should not take your distributions? Am I understanding your point of view properly?

16,GDP," >Debt doesn’t matter as long as the economy grows faster than the interest rate.

This system relies on a few assumptions, but none of them are unreasonable. It would absolutely be a huge problem if any of them did turn out to be false. The assumption that is the least safe is that government will not be highly incompetent going into the future. I suppose this depends on our faith in democracy. It's unfair calling it a scam or ponzi scheme, since all the necessary assumptions seem more likely than not.

The Fed has tools that directly affect the interest rate. Of course, interest targeting isn't the only priority that the Fed has; it's completely conceivable that it could clash and lose out to other targets sometime in the future.

All that being said, what really matters isn't short or medium term changes in interest rates, debt, or GDP growth. Credit will continue being extended to the US as long as the long-term trend is consistent (i.e. over years and decades) and the Fed continues to appear in-control over interest rates.

The whole point of the Fed is to smooth out the short and medium term, and it would take a black swan event that directly (and fundamentally) contradicts current macroeconomic theory to shake that confidence (e.g. the stagflation of the 70's). That, or incredible governmental mismanagement not exclusive to the Fed.

Neither scenario is implausible, but both have probability that is impossible to estimate, and (as far as we can tell) seem to happen very rarely. Additionally, macroeconomic theory was quick to absorb the lessons of stagflation and the great depression (not that it has any bearing on the probability that the rest of government won't be highly incompetent).  By comparison, major stock market corrections are expected to happen at least every few years, a recession is expected to happen at least every few decades (i.e. the business cycle). Although 2008 did bring changes to macroeconomic theory, it was mostly regarding global connectedness and generations-long changes in the business-cycle (e.g. the mainstream acceptance of Hyman Minsky's work on instability). None of what happened in 2008 clashed with the current understanding of the relationship between inflation, interest, sovereign debt, aggregate demand, and other fundamental theoretical building blocks of macroeconomics.

Since short and medium term GDP growth and interest rate shifts do not matter, and we cannot assume that long-term interest rates aren't under control (until proven otherwise), we're finally left with the assumption that long-term GDP growth will indefinitely continue. This in particular has ""end of history"" vibes. Although there is absolutely a theoretical limit to economic growth, it's mostly in the realm of sci-fi (e.g. environmental or nuclear catastrophe, or futuristic utopia).

Easy - lots of salary expense for new divisions  that aren’t earning revenue yet, marketing, etc. And then amortization/depreciation of assets.

I don’t know specifically what it is in this case but there are many legitimate ways to offset income, which is common early in a fast growing company’s life (which is then carried forward to profitable years).",thing85,8,/r/investing/comments/oht1o9/where_does_it_say_amazon_paid_no_taxes_in_2018/h4t35g9/,0.033,0.811,0.156,0.8624

They didn't create **operating** losses -- but they weren't profitable on a \_tax\_ basis (or later not \_as\_ profitable as they would be without all that growth and accompanying depreciation). Those are very different things, just as cash flow is different to profits.

A company growing very rapidly, making big capital obligations will find depreciation expense growing very rapidly. Depreciation and amortization expense is a non-cash entry, the cash is there, but from a tax accounting perspective there's a bookkeeping loss entry to offset it. This is one of the techniques Amazon used, but not the only one.

Because few other companies have ever been able to grow their balance sheets as quickly, Amazon's accumulated depreciation expense has grown extraordinarily- look at the five years from 2016 ($13 Billion in accumulated depreciation expense) to 2020 ($60 Billion in accumulated depreciation expense). These are staggering numbers-- I'd be curious to know if any other company has ever generated anything like that.

One aspect of such a strategy is that it requires continuing, and indeed accelerating growth. Amazon is hugely incentivized to make big capital investments, effectively giving them the lowest cost of capital in the financial markets. Bezos has understood his company's tax and capital spending model as brilliantly as his business model . . . a unique differentiator.

Ultimately, though, Amazon's ability to make ever huger capital investments is limited, so this aspect of their advantage will wane . . . it also makes them vulnerable to big losses-- you make these giant capital investments, and if you can't actually generated cash flow from it, the Return on Equity will be terrible (eg if you have to start writing down these assets as charges against equity-- different to depreciation-- that hurts) . . . but to date, Amazon ROE has been terrific. All Bezos, Jassy and Company have to do is keep on making great investments . . . \[not\] so easy",amp1212,15,/r/investing/comments/oht1o9/where_does_it_say_amazon_paid_no_taxes_in_2018/h4sobcv/,0.08,0.751,0.168,0.9853

38,HSBC," Hi! I'm a new investor looking for advice. Please find my current situation below:

*How old are you? What country do you live in?*

I'm 40, I live in Bermuda, however I hold South African citizenship.

*Are you employed/making income? How much?*

I make about $185K a year (after tax).

*What are your objectives with this money? (Buy a house? Retirement savings?)*

For now, I am simply looking to make a better return than keeping my savings in a bank’s account.

*What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs?*

I have no immediate needs. A good portion can be long term (20 years).

*What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know its 100% safe?)*

Medium.

*What are your current holdings? (Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors? Any other assets?)*

I have very little holdings. My largest “asset” is my bank account.

*Any big debts (include interest rate) or expenses?*

None.

*And any other relevant financial information will be useful to give you a proper answer.*

* I already have a good pension plan with my company and a separate, significant amount of savings in an HSBC bank account.
* From watching the Bogleheads videos and reading some of the reddit/r/personalfinance , I understand a reasonable plan for now (or to get started) would be to open a trading account and invest in ETFs. I would be investing long-term and avoid trying to beat the market with short term trades.
* Bermuda does not have a tax treaty with the US, so I am subject to a withholding tax of 30% of gross US-source payments, such as dividends, interest, and royalties. I would not, however, be taxed on capital gains.
* The cash I would like to invest is in Bermuda Dollar (BMD), which is pegged at 1:1 with the US Dollar (USD), however a small amount is charged to convert this.
* I have no trading experience. I’ve opened an account with Interactive Brokers (IBKR) and have applied for one with TD Ameritrade (Non-US citizens cannot use Vanguard or Fidelity).
* I have around $150K I would like to invest for now. Once I am comfortable with the process, I could increase this substantially.

My main concerns or questions are:

* I would be subject to the 30% withholding tax, a conversion cost from BMD to USD, any commission or trading fees, a wire transfer fee from my account to the brokerage, and perhaps other unforeseen fees. Does this setup seem cost effective?
* A lot of advice I find online is for the US market. Given my setup, would I be better off investing elsewhere?
* As I have no trading experience, what should I be wary of here? I may buy at the wrong time, price, buy into the wrong fund, etc. So far I’ve done a few trades on IBKR’s paper trading, but am far from comfortable with the platform and with the trading process in general.
* Would I be more effective, given that I do not have a high-risk approach and appetite for frequent trading, and given specifics to the location where I reside, if I gave this over to a broker at my bank or a separate firm to invest on my behalf?

Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.",Away_Year3804,2,/r/investing/comments/oi12vc/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/h4t3886/,0.032,0.886,0.082,0.9777

40,ETH," I’m 22m living in the U.S. I’m a student, working as well but total income is probably less than $10,000 a year. These are long term investments, soonest I would access most of this would be for a down payment on a house in 10 years or so, barring emergencies. But ideally I hold for decades and live off dividends when I’m old. Down to risk a fraction of my portfolio but want 80% locked up and safe. 
I have about $25k in VFIAX, $7.5k in Colgate, ~$2k in ethereum, and $100 or so floating around Webull. I have no debt, but would like to pursue my masters sooner rather than later. I want to sell all of my Colgate, buy another ETH or two and put the rest into VFIAX. This is because Colgate, while growing reliably, does not grow nearly as fast as VFIAX, where I have more capital anyways, and I’m very bullish on ETH and want to stake more before the APY goes down again. 
Colgate and VFIAX are long term assets, so I thought I wouldn’t pay any capital gains but I forgot about the state capital gains, which are around 5% regardless of my lack of income. Is it still worth it to split my Colgate into VFIAX and Ethereum or should I just hang on to avoid capital gains tax? I really feel like ETH will glo up soon and want to buy and stake the next big dip. Plus I already withdrew $2.5k total in long term this year (dumbass decision, will not repeat), so I already owe a little state capital gains.

That's assuming that you can whether the storms. If the market loses 30%+ of its value in a few months, like it did in 2008, will you stay the course? Or will you sell in a panic? If so, the target date might be better.  If international starts outperforming the US market, as some predict will happen, there's a decent chance your target date might do start doing better than the S&P. be prepared for that to happen. 

The TDF also might be better if you will never look at it again. when you're in your 40s or so, you should probably add some conservative investments, like cash or bonds (or just go to a  target date fund then.

66,IMO," Were markets meant to be a store of wealth for the entire US population's retirement savings?

Short answer, **no**. And there may not be enough productivity in public corporations to satisfy that need. Markets were originally meant to help raise capital but it's turned into a too-big-to-fail pension fund. 

Michael Green and others have been raising this idea in light of current valuations. This is why equity valuations are where they are. The entire idea of ""risk"" as we know it is turned upside down as a result. Markets can keep going up until, well I guess at some point APPL will settle into 50 PE which would put it around 0% real earnings yield...is that the end game? Followed by flat returns for the rest of our working lives? 

I think now is a time to be tactical and look for any opportunities that don't have such stretched valuations. 

- Europe & Japanese equities aren't anywhere near as overvalued as US. Probably the best deal IMO.

- Gold has an expected real return of 0%, which sounds miserable but still better than the real yield of treasuries or TIPS, especially when considering the dubious Cpi calculations.

- US growth is the new ""defensive"" play, but valuation multiples at some point have to stop going up..its just math. I don't know when it will stop (Apple at 50PE?).

- Latin America has a lot of potential but with a lot of risk to go along with it. Ditto for China.

- There are still pockets of fairly valued companies in the US, but a tactical approach is needed to seek specific stocks. The US Value and Dividend ETFs as a whole are filled with value traps. I think many utility companies are under valued (yes I'm a big fan of public utilities), but if you purchase a utility ETF you are stuck with a bunch of utilities with wildfire risk, or Next Era Energy (great company but stretched valuations) .",cr0ne,2,/r/investing/comments/oi8rp2/can_risk_parity_work_as_an_investment_strategy/h4u6fo2/,0.059,0.799,0.143,0.9834
