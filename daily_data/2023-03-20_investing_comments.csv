51,BAC," >Can someone explain why the Credit Suisse and SVB situation is causing all bank stocks to fall? Why would JPM and BAC fall b/c of another bank's problems?

One fear (and the reason the FDIC stepped in with SVB) is so-called ""contagion"". The basic idea is that our economic system is interconnected, so if one big chunk starts failing (like dozens of start-ups, all with their money in SVB, suddenly failing to make payroll and collapsing) it can cause damage to other areas. However, at least for SVB/Signature, I don't think that's an issue: the Feds stepped in and depositors both have access to their money and will be made hold. 

My (admittedly quite uninformed) guess is that it's not people fearing that the ""SVB situation"" specifically is what's ""***causing***"" bank stocks to fall more generally. Instead, my guess is that people simply fear that the same ***type of problem*** that hit SVB/Signature (sharply rising rates harming banks that are overly committed to low-interest debt or otherwise in trouble already) will harm banks generally, and that these failures are simply the early examples, the canaries in the coal mine.

Credit Suisse appears to be largely much more a problem of its own making: it already took a series of haymakers for random scandals its been involved in, and they're all catching up with it now. It was already struggling and then, [per CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/16/investing/why-credit-suisse-is-struggling/index.html):

>The trigger for Wednesday’s rout in Credit Suisse shares wasn’t rising rates. It came from comments by the bank’s biggest backer — the Saudi National Bank — that it wasn’t prepared to put up more money after buying a near-10% stake for $1.5 billion last year. 

Now, certainly, Credit Suisse is *bigger* ($570+b in assets vs. ~$210b in assets for SVB or ~$110b for Signature), so I suppose there may be more fear of contagion if it collapsed, so maybe that's scaring folks. But again, I think the real industry-wide fear is rising rates exposing warts on banks that have been riding high on cheap money for a while now.",throwawayinvestacct,2,/r/investing/comments/11wdhv8/daily_general_discussion_and_advice_thread_march/jcy6qmm/,0.12,0.83,0.05,-0.9738
52,JPM," >Can someone explain why the Credit Suisse and SVB situation is causing all bank stocks to fall? Why would JPM and BAC fall b/c of another bank's problems?

One fear (and the reason the FDIC stepped in with SVB) is so-called ""contagion"". The basic idea is that our economic system is interconnected, so if one big chunk starts failing (like dozens of start-ups, all with their money in SVB, suddenly failing to make payroll and collapsing) it can cause damage to other areas. However, at least for SVB/Signature, I don't think that's an issue: the Feds stepped in and depositors both have access to their money and will be made hold.

53,USA," If you don't care for retirement investing (IRAs), then open a regular taxable brokerage account.  Invest the money in a Total USA ETF or a diverse dividend growth ETF for 5+ years. 

Some ETF examples: VTI, SCHB, DGRO, or VIG.


FYI...investing is a long-term process.  Minimum 5 years.  Trading is short-term with high risk of losing money, and low potential to gain money.  43% increase has a better possibility in 5 years than a short-term gamble.",InvestingNerd2020,2,/r/investing/comments/11wdhv8/daily_general_discussion_and_advice_thread_march/jcy6dfj/,0.117,0.744,0.139,0.416
54,TD," Do it yourself.  I have IRAs at Vanguard, ETrade, TD (Schwab) and Fidelity.   Not much of a difference between the nuts and bolds of the IRA or the investment selection but the web sites as you get more advanced in order types is significant.  Ranking best to last is 

1. TD (Schwab)
2. Fidelity
3. E-Trade
4. Vanguard

TD is the easiest for entering multiple order and reusing executed or existing order.   I like the fidelity research layout a lot.  Vanguard is a pain to even enter a single order. 

Take it from someone in their 50s.   You can't go wrong starting investing at your age.  Any brokerage will be fine and you can always move in the future.  Just get started.

55,MA," Fidelity. Decent app, good website. Plenty of options to invest in. Cash management accounts available, robo-advisor is kind of neat, 2% “cash back” credit card with Visa Signature perks. Plenty ATMs to use if you need that. The people I’ve spoken with at the branch in Hingham, MA are very nice and pretty helpful.

56,USA," Avoid Robinhood for an IRA.  Too many issues.

Look into Fidelity or Charles Schwab.  No need for an adviser until you get over $100k.  Just dump it into a Total USA index mutual fund for it's diversity and reliability long-term.  

For Fidelity: FZROX or FSKAX
