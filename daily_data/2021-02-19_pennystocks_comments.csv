It’s all free and will be part of Schwab’s platform in the future, but I’ve gotten used to it. There’s still the 4.95 fee for otc and some other fees with broker related trades and options, but they remain mostly free. For me it’s been great and I’ve made a good amount of money using that as opposed to anything else not crypto related.

58,UI," Yo!  Schwab UI is rough to get a hang of..  Absolutely worth it though!  Their trading tools and features are awesome!

A few tips:
Trade Source page is your best friend - full account overview, all-in-one trades, market data, trade status, literally everything you need.  It takes some tweaking and learning but is an awesome resource

Research tabs provide some valuable information - latest news articles, gap lists, stock alerts, recent charts that display the high and low for that time period for quick trend analysis 

Their customer support is awesome - they have a callback system to avoid waiting on hold, always very helpful and informative, will provide you ample detail to make an informed decision for your best course of action
  -ex: didn’t know shit about warrants, called to exercise some, luckily was provided with the info to determine that it is in my best interest to hodl and sell prior to expiry.  Their ability to inform and empower your decision making without providing actual financial advice/position recommendations is incredibly.  

App is atrocious, unless you are looking to make a quick trade, don’t bother.  Trying to analyze my positions and daily/overall movement makes my brain hurt.  I keep a little fun money in the hood and webull to mess with from mobile

What you do is initiate a transfer on Schwab from RH, then contact Schwab a day after asking them to cancel the transfer since WeBull is doing a fee waiving promo.

However, the iSPERSE technology seems promising, but I wish there was a bit more clinical information on the efficacy of the system. Additionally, it seems that the majority of their products aren't even to phase 2 trials. I understand there is a pandemic, but the substantial costs of phase 2 / 3 trials, not to mention the time, are something you have to consider before they start to achieve any significant profit.

This stock will likely be ripe with speculative gains/losses given there are no upcoming catalysts (Q3 maybe?). I am also missing any competitors. I'll google myself to find but claiming in-depth DD without showing any sign of competitive advantage is also iffy.

The company states ""potential licensing agreement with J&J"". It is not a done deal yet, however it is promising that J&J appears to have interest.

189,CEO," It's a pump and dump stock fueled by the CEO spewing fake information on Twitter. That's all it has ever been and all it will ever be.

Some people kept going on and on about their revolutionary hearing aids that you can find on Alibaba with the exact same features, or better, for $20. Their hearing test stations were supposed to be in stores something like 2 years ago. Their company site pumps their stock and hides their products (it's under a submenu rofl), their twitter pumps their stocks, their Google photos of their HQ pumps their stock (ticker is on their sign for christ sake!). Why would anyone believe this garbage company. I get it if you're in it for the P&D, but a lot of people were trying to convince people it's a REAL company going places? Come on.

Neither of those are retailer deals like the CEO is claiming to have and yet to reveal. Again, you can get same features for $20 off Alibaba. There's nothing special about this companies hearing aids, which based off the non-fake reviews are absolute garbage. The CEO is also claiming some bullshit NDA on retailer deals, which isn't a thing that's done lol.

205,CEO," I’m actually an MD, but you can find a lot of the info online. The results of the phase II trial for this product can be found [on the company’s website](https://ir.citiuspharma.com) and it’s now in the final phase before it can be approved. They report a 100% success rate which is always suspicious to people in medicine because nothing is 100%, but I think it was because the numbers were small.

Penny stocks and pharmaceuticals are generally both high-risk and high-reward. I’m not a financial advisor, just an average person who started learning a lot about this, but I quickly learned that people who have been doing this for a long time often don’t mess around with penny stocks for a number of reasons. They are hard to research so you often have little information to go off of, they can be very volatile, and the companies can go out of business suddenly.

Stocks in general have risk, so the most fundamental way to minimize risk is to learn more about investing. What is a P/E ratio, how to read an earnings report, what websites have more information. The second most fundamental way to minimize risk is to put money on a variety of things in different sectors (think different markets like technology, consumables, agriculture, banks, insurance, aerospace, raw materials whatever) so if any one stock or sector gets hit hard you don’t lose everything.

yahoo finance and Market Watch are places to go where you can at least see if analysts rate a stock as “buy” “sell” or in between. These can lag behind current events so you still need to read the news about the stock, look up their CEO/CFO, look at their earnings sheets and try to wrap your head around some of the info.",CardiacSchmardiac,3,/r/pennystocks/comments/lnhlr9/ctxr_dawson_james_raises_pt_to_8_after_offering/go1gad3/,0.078,0.879,0.043,-0.8338

The thesis that graphite will be needed is great.  In fact I agree with it.  We all (should) know anodes will be graphite heavy for a long time going forward.  But how is this company going to compete with Novonix and Talga.  Why are they going to be competitive? Also, whats the frame of reference for the CEO purchasing shares.  This is a random number of shares without context.  Additionally, you don't need to partner with Tesla to be successful in the battery field.  Certainly not to be a successful graphite source.

Also, licensing approval shouldn't be a win, it should be a minor detail or hurdle that was taken care of.  Think about when Tesla had to worry about wildlife in Berlin.  It became a non-issue.

255,EV," All battery plays are counting on auto manufacturers swapping over to EV soon enough to push demand for batteries. One of the biggest catalysts for that change is going to be batteries you can get more than about a hundred miles out of before a recharge.

In my mind, they're linked. The time frames may as well be the same, since the main things holding electric vehicles back are lack of existing infrastructure and lack of range/appropriate batteries.

REDWOOD CITY, Calif., Jan. 05, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Biotricity Inc. (OTCQB:BTCY), a medical diagnostic and consumer healthcare technology company, announced today that it made a 510(k) submission to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), on December 31 2020, for Biotres. The company expects this process to take at least 4 months, and if the Company’s 510(k) application is cleared by the FDA the Company expects a product launch thereafter. 

As announced previously, Biotres is a 3-lead patch product for ECG and arrhythmia monitoring for patients at risk for or being diagnosed with certain cardiac issues. Biotres can work as a Holter, Event Loop, and Extended Holter.

“We are excited to announce the 510(k) FDA submission for Biotres and look forward to building out our product offerings further in 2021,” stated Waqaas Al Siddiq, CEO of Biotricity. “We believe that Biotres addresses demand from some of our existing customers and a need in the holter market.” 

The Biotres is a holter product that was developed to address the challenges that exist with current holter patch products. The Biotres is designed with the following key features:

3 Channel Recording – A wearable holter patch device that can provide continuous 3 channel recording of ECG (heart) data. All other holter patch devices are 1 channel or 2 channels. 

Rechargeable Battery – The device can be worn continuously for 48 hours, before needing to be charged for 1 hr., enabling continuous data collection for extended periods of time without any intervention, something not possible with traditional holter patch solutions. 

Wireless Connectivity – The unique device utilizes Bluetooth technology to offload data, reducing the time for diagnoses. Current holter patch solutions can take up to a week before diagnoses are available due to manual data downloading and a lack of connectivity. 

User-Friendly Design – Easy to understand and comfortable to wear during regular day-to-day activities.

274,DD," Yes.

If you search I did a DD couple of weeks ago.  I linked their press release from 2019 showing lithium extraction tech checked by outside independent lab of 99.97% extraction.  They think they can get the last 0.03% from using some resin balls as the last little bit seems to be mixed with the water and otherwise lost in the end.  That is by FAR best in class.

Battery recycling tech numbers are supposed to be out any day now.  Mr. Dumas ?CEO stated in a tweet earlier it should be 96% or so.  Again will be best in class.  It MUST be good because Mr. Pelosi jumped on board in about 5 minutes of the discussion with Altair of doing work together!  They also just signed a feasiblity study to open a recyling plant in Quebec so they must be confident the numbers are already great.  They talk about the few % that is left over in the battery will be used as fertilizer so NONE of it is wasted to the environment.  Also, they talk about recycling the left over electricity still in the battery and reselling it to the grid.  

If that doesn't amaze you I am not sure what will.  Hope that helped.",10xwannabe,3,/r/pennystocks/comments/lmze6s/the_stock_that_has_the_possibility_to_retire_you/gnygvgv/,0.046,0.844,0.11,0.9449

276,DD, Not sure why you’re getting downvoted. It’s DD worth reading - and they’re not loose connections. Appreciate you sharing,WonLinerz,6,/r/pennystocks/comments/lmze6s/the_stock_that_has_the_possibility_to_retire_you/gny1j97/,0.177,0.544,0.279,0.3489
277,DD," A good DD isn't one that grabs your attention and makes an easy to read argument that the stock is going to skyrocket. A good DD is one that looks into all the factors around a company and brings to light any red flags. Other comments have raised major red flags that the OP has missed/hasn't mentioned, thus it's a trash DD (though very well written if the objective is to grab attention and convince people to part with their money).",NedStarkGetsExecuted,8,/r/pennystocks/comments/lmze6s/the_stock_that_has_the_possibility_to_retire_you/gnzwj5d/,0.029,0.82,0.151,0.8622

OCGN. $3 to $1.5 all the way up to $20 and now down to about $10.

Time in the market beats timing the market but boy, I really suck at timing it.

I have over $100k in OPTI and AITX. This week had been ROUGHH. But fundamentally, OPTI is a better company today than it was last week when it was on fire rocketing towards Jupiter.

291,EV," Clean energy is going to be huge as well. Uranium in particular unless an efficient and scalable renewable technology is developed. Hydro, wind and solar just don't generate anywhere near enough power. Nuclear is very clean, and capable of massive generation.

Also, companies that produce electric cables are likely to see a boom in the coming years. Partially due to increased demand from EV chargers, but also political drives to reduce or eliminate fossil fuels for heating homes - electric heating draws a lot of power, higher electricity demand means larger cables, and more cables on a development than a development heated by natural gas.

293,ALL," Nice post!  A few comments.    
During my look for lithium plays I ran into PILBF which has good revs and good future potential and isn't bloated in price yet.

Vector is correct on the riding out the ups and downs of Pennys until they pay off bigger in the long run and you cash in when you want with high profit is a great approach.  That said, I want to point out that ALL Pennys are still risky, and I've seen Penny's never come back up for years and years and one that even folded on me.  This market has been real hot this past year or so, but don't always expect such friendly market.  Thus you may want to set stop limits for yourself so you don't lose all, or even set it near where you buy and then buy in again when conditions improve, and make sure not to put all your eggs in one baskset.  Bottom line, if you believe in the stock make sure there's some good reasons...and at the same time make sure they don't sink you.",Son_of_Klaatu,3,/r/pennystocks/comments/lmxpah/some_advice_plus_some_tickers_mixed_in/gnz1xu3/,0.026,0.778,0.196,0.9843

Probably if compliance is achieved a lot of people will use the spike to dump their shares and it'll cause the price to dip.

I will be buying HITIF during the day after doing some very basic DD. Basically I compared TLRY’s most recent earnings with HITIF’s estimates from yesterday’s press release.

HITIF undergoing consolidation plus took a battering from weed dump collateral damage. Fundamentals are still solid. 

NMGRF just had a large private investment and has consolidated pretty good now, might be a good time to buy the dip. That graphite mine is gonna be yugggee

IQST riding high from removing ALL DEBT + their fintech and IOT operations are sexy. Recently announced a fortune 500 deal. Great fundamentals. 

MSNVF just overall solid af, great fundamentals and recurring govt revenue

SWRM - Solid deals announced. Decent vertical with strong growth. Fundamentals are good overall. 

DMGGF - most undervalued crypto miner IMO. Half the capacity of Riot but trading at a way more discounted value.

DNN is a medium to long play, depending on what you think the future of nuclear is. They have found (by a considerable margin) the highest quality uranium on the planet, and it is so close to the surface, their drilling costs will be unusually low.

IF, now that's an **IF**, we see interest in uranium, if there is global shortage and/or certain nations decide to actively pursue nuclear, DNN will be printing money. There will be no other company with what they have.

The past few days by a short trader, with a fairly small position,  has been able to manipulate the share price on low volume (due to the also low float).. from $7.50 into $5s

But 1-2 week $10-11 PT is still the same, which offers a x2 opportunity.  Also, 2 month PT is still $20...... & End of Year PT: $75+ (with positive Phase 3 results).

Vanguard acquired just over a 12% stake in the last 2 weeks, and co-founders own over 55% of shares, which are locked up 12 months. So super low float now- as volume picks up and this becomes less under the radar... it will start jumpin ( $120M Market Cap currently).

Reminder that the management team has one of the best track records & most expertise in the Biotech World.  Here are truncated Bios of just 4 of the Co-Founders:

Raphael Mechoulam: Discovered the body’s endocannabinoid system. Harvey Award 2020 winner for formulating Synthetic THC CBD analogs. (Potential 2021 Nobel nominee).

Dr James Woody: Discovered Remicade (J&J acquired for $5 Billion. Sales of $50B + since approval). Founded Avidia & Proteolix (sold to Amgen). CEO & Founder of Oncomed Pharma. President of Roche Bioscience.

Prof Sir Marc Feldman: Oxford. Discovered anti-TNF therapy- which Remicade, Humira etc are based on ($159B class by 2025). Lead clinical trial for drug Remicade (J&J acquired for $5 Billion). Lasker award winner (2nd only to Nobel).

Prof Lawrence Steinman: Stanford. Founder of Neurocrine Bio. Discovered role of integrins, Tysabri (Biogen acquired for $3 Billion).

* Bitcoin mining company in Canada

* Market cap is about 20-25% of what $RIOT and $MARA trade at

* Hut8 has more Bitcoin than both $RIOT and $MARA by a SIGNIFICANT margin. 3012 Bitcoin was their balance as disclosed a few days ago. This means money being made with 0 costs associated with mining whenever Bitcoin is rising. Current Bitcoin balance is worth about $161m.

* Hut8 has more current mining power than both MARA, RIOT and other competitors in this space like ARGO

* Currently mining 7 bitcoin everyday, that means by end of 2021 their Bitcoin balance will be around 5252 bitcoin worth almost $300m at current BTC prices. So 1/3 of their market cap which is $900m in bitcoin balance alone.

Why is it so low compared to $RIOT and $MARA? I don't know, the only reason I have found for being so much lower is that they're listed in Toronto or OTC as $HUTMF instead of being on the NASDAQ like $RIOT and $MARA.

I absolutely love this stock and can't believe the value. I made a DD thread on my twitter (@Carrera757) if you want to know more.

484,COG," --Company Overview--

Good Life China Corporation operates a chain of over 2,000 franchised convenience stores in Hebei Province, the People's Republic of China. The company employs retail concepts, such as e-commerce enabled POS/back office systems. Its stores offer various products, such as fast food and snacks, groceries, alcoholic beverages, health and beauty aids, kitchen appliances, clothing and footwear, toys, newspapers and magazines, hardware, and specialty regional products. It also provides warehousing and distribution services for farm input products, as well as sells commodity crops on behalf of local farmers. In addition, the company, through its subsidiary, Miluga Corp, provides baking birthday and exquisite cakes, and bread and croissants, as well as offers flower delivery services. 

AKA, China's 7/11 


--Convienience Store Industry in China--

A KPMG research report in 2020 noted that leading convenience store chains (such as GLCC)  maintained their competitive edge over local convenience stores and “mom-and-pop” stores. 

They are focusing on profitable products and cost optimisation, and their net profit margin in tier 2 cities (such as the ones in Hebei) is around 5 percent. In terms of product structure, local convenience stores and “mom-and-pop” stores seldom sell instant food products; In comparison, the chains stores can meet customer demand for instant food products while obtaining a higher gross margin from this segment. The average sales per square metre of convenience stores in mainland China is estimated to be RMB 69 per day, lower than the operating efficiency of some of the top international companies.

With respect to the market environment, most companies consider the market to be relatively fair, with few cases of false reporting and unfair competition. About 40 percent of the surveyed companies believe the market is not saturated and that there is still room for expansion. 




--Catalysts--

The convenience store industry in China continued to grow rapidly, outperforming other physical retail store categories, with the number of convenience stores hitting a record high and average single-store sales increasing year-on-year, according to a joint report by KPMG and the China Chain Store and Franchise Association (CCFA). Tier 2 and tier 3 cities have become the new areas for expansion as the economy continues to grow.




--Financials and Technicals-- 

The company currently has revenues of 5.5M with gross profits of 3.9M and a positive EBITDA of 600k. Revenues are down 76% in 2020, but this is to be expected as the Hebei region was close to the epicenter of the COVID outbreak (Wuhan) and the resulting countrywide lockdowns caused obvious adverse business pressures for that fiscal. As the countrys economy is now rapidly accelerating once again, research predicts retail store revenues to increase accordingly. 

Volume has been steadily rising over the past 10 days. 3 month average volume is 4M and last 19 day average volume is 17.5M, a very bullish sign. 

RSI (1M) is at 58, reflecting neither oversold nor overbought conditions. COG is at a low which signals a potential good entry point. However, the MACD derivative appears to be slightly trending downwards. 

Over the past month, the stock has gained 300% and has been consolidating for the past 2 weeks. 



--Summary--

Good Life China Corp (GLCC) is a well established chain of convienience stores that is expanding its footprint in both rural areas through crop trading and online through its e-commerce platform. While the company suffered significantly last year due to the COVID pandemic, it has performed well overall with decent financials maintaining a profit. The convienience store Industry is rapidly growing as per KPMG's latest report and GLCC appears to be well positioned to capitalize on this trend. The stocks technicals overall show a good entry point with potential for further upside due to steadily increasing volume and an undervalued market cap at its current price of 0.0004. This makes it one of the last few 0.000x plays with potential IMO.

486,RSI," --Company Overview--

Good Life China Corporation operates a chain of over 2,000 franchised convenience stores in Hebei Province, the People's Republic of China. The company employs retail concepts, such as e-commerce enabled POS/back office systems. Its stores offer various products, such as fast food and snacks, groceries, alcoholic beverages, health and beauty aids, kitchen appliances, clothing and footwear, toys, newspapers and magazines, hardware, and specialty regional products. It also provides warehousing and distribution services for farm input products, as well as sells commodity crops on behalf of local farmers. In addition, the company, through its subsidiary, Miluga Corp, provides baking birthday and exquisite cakes, and bread and croissants, as well as offers flower delivery services. 

AKA, China's 7/11 


--Convienience Store Industry in China--

A KPMG research report in 2020 noted that leading convenience store chains (such as GLCC)  maintained their competitive edge over local convenience stores and “mom-and-pop” stores. 

They are focusing on profitable products and cost optimisation, and their net profit margin in tier 2 cities (such as the ones in Hebei) is around 5 percent. In terms of product structure, local convenience stores and “mom-and-pop” stores seldom sell instant food products; In comparison, the chains stores can meet customer demand for instant food products while obtaining a higher gross margin from this segment. The average sales per square metre of convenience stores in mainland China is estimated to be RMB 69 per day, lower than the operating efficiency of some of the top international companies.

With respect to the market environment, most companies consider the market to be relatively fair, with few cases of false reporting and unfair competition. About 40 percent of the surveyed companies believe the market is not saturated and that there is still room for expansion. 




--Catalysts--

The convenience store industry in China continued to grow rapidly, outperforming other physical retail store categories, with the number of convenience stores hitting a record high and average single-store sales increasing year-on-year, according to a joint report by KPMG and the China Chain Store and Franchise Association (CCFA). Tier 2 and tier 3 cities have become the new areas for expansion as the economy continues to grow.




--Financials and Technicals-- 

The company currently has revenues of 5.5M with gross profits of 3.9M and a positive EBITDA of 600k. Revenues are down 76% in 2020, but this is to be expected as the Hebei region was close to the epicenter of the COVID outbreak (Wuhan) and the resulting countrywide lockdowns caused obvious adverse business pressures for that fiscal. As the countrys economy is now rapidly accelerating once again, research predicts retail store revenues to increase accordingly. 

Volume has been steadily rising over the past 10 days. 3 month average volume is 4M and last 19 day average volume is 17.5M, a very bullish sign. 

RSI (1M) is at 58, reflecting neither oversold nor overbought conditions. COG is at a low which signals a potential good entry point. However, the MACD derivative appears to be slightly trending downwards. 

Over the past month, the stock has gained 300% and has been consolidating for the past 2 weeks. 



--Summary--

Good Life China Corp (GLCC) is a well established chain of convienience stores that is expanding its footprint in both rural areas through crop trading and online through its e-commerce platform. While the company suffered significantly last year due to the COVID pandemic, it has performed well overall with decent financials maintaining a profit. The convienience store Industry is rapidly growing as per KPMG's latest report and GLCC appears to be well positioned to capitalize on this trend. The stocks technicals overall show a good entry point with potential for further upside due to steadily increasing volume and an undervalued market cap at its current price of 0.0004. This makes it one of the last few 0.000x plays with potential IMO.

496,CEO," I just started looking into this and these are Key points that I have picked up from them.. If anyone has corrections feel free. 

Acquire lighting companies and have a large income swapping fluorescent systems to LED/ pushing energy efficient lighting. Among their recent acquisitions is SGE which specializes in revamping light systems and they have 13mill worth of work lined up. The CEO of SGE is coming along with as an advisor. (Need lights for dope growing)

They’ve acquired an HVAC company that seems to push antivirus clean air systems. (Need air for dope growing)

They operate a company that just deals in killing covid I believe and is doing well. (Uses ultraviolet light.) 

They want to use their LED expertise to build some sort of indoor farm land to legit grow food. (You can’t tell me their hydroponic tomato system isn’t going to benefit their dope growing). 

to me it all seems to circle around to helping their cannabis industry, but perhaps in a way that doesn’t steer the dope haters away? 

It seems brilliant honestly. Covering all their bases. 

Also they’re changing their ticker to FOMO; which supposedly is going to drive people nuts. I don’t understand it myself, but I like money so I’m in.

This is very good news. The CEO is starting to step up and make good decisions. Per the Company Twitter account today:

* New additions to the team to manage Social Media/Investor Relations
* Reverse Split officially cancelled via SEC 8-K filing
* Several big announcements planned over the next few weeks

Really? Data to be released at any time? Come on man. With this new drug, it’s early. So early. It’s only completed Phase 1. And lots of things can go wrong in clinical trials. Most drugs don’t have successful phase 2, even fewer drugs go on to have successful phase 3.

If everything goes as they project it to, NDA isn’t expected until 2025 or 2026 per their own estimate. So that’s 4 to 5 years of clinical trials until they even file for FDA approval. There also aren’t any other drugs in the pipeline as far as I can tell.

One drawback is that cyclophilin inhibitors haven't worked too well in the past, but CRV431 is showing good data via the reduction in certain biomarkers, its good safety/tolerability profile thus far, and also the in-house AI platform (Valuable by itself) that is giving Hepion a strong analytical tool to work off of to increase its efficiency and reduce risks in the clinical stage.

CRV431 is a Cyclophilin inhibitor, and Cyclophilins are related to these issues as well:

Viral Hepatitis • Cancers • Acute And Chronic Lung Injury • Myocardial Infarction • Stroke • Arthritis • Atherosclerosis • Thrombosis • Aortic Aneurysm • Coronary Artery Disease • Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension • ALS • Alzheimers Disease • Multiple Sclerosis • Muscular Dystrophies • Traumatic CNS Injury

If everything works out, and the drug proves even slightly effective for certain targeted groups, we are still looking at a slice of the massive pie that is the potential NASH market.

668,CEO," Guys, I’m not currently invested in UAVS but I was when it first gained some hype last year (summer 2020). I listened in on their call last summer when the rumoured “Amazon” partnership wasn’t confirmed and the stock tanked. I’d sold before then with some nice profit so I didn’t look at the stock again until I noticed it’d spiked so much recently.

My point is, I remember how this whole investigation started. While I’m not following the stock presently at all, and nor am I invested in it, all I can share with you is a bit of detail regarding what went on with the “video” as referenced in this article.

Essentially, a video was circulated and I don’t recall the exact details but it subliminally indicated to some viewers (based on their inferences) that UAVS may partner with Amazon. r/pennystocks was going crazy and hyping it up, and the stock was rising with hype leading up to their call. When I listened in on the call, there was no mention of Amazon and if I recall correctly the CEO actually announced that he was stepping down from the position. Of course, the stock tanked. It was later found out that the initial video was shared or created by the CEO’s daughter on YouTube. 

My point is, that happened last year when UAVS was a penny stock. I have no idea how the company had developed since I don’t follow it, but I will say that the fact that it went to $15 or so this year was well after the whole “video” debacle so I’m assuming the rise was based on the company’s merit. So, this investigation was already started last year, it really isn’t anything new AFAIK. However, it may be that they are looking at the issue again? I’m not sure I only read this report that OP linked and nothing else.

Hope that helps give some background to anyone that bought recently. Again, not invested in this so apart from what happened last year I can’t give much insight.

I would recommend looking into $DBKSF ($DIGI.CN) NOT a mining stock but they are releasing a predictive Ai crypto app next week. LOTS of income potential. Great stock for under 50 cents. 

 (I AM NOT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH AND DD.) 

They are releasing a predictive Ai app next week (Feb 22) for BTC and ETH! 

Here is a live interview from this week with the CEO which pretty much explains everything that we can expect from this company.

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=amLm5UFMYRA&t=1691s

If you skip to 26:00 min mark, CEO Chris Carl says, ""on the move with Elon Musk and Bitcoin, that happened last week, we got a green arrow about 3 hours before the news came out, so if you were using this app you would be fully invested, and we rode it to to the top, and our app captured about 73% of the swing, and then we saw another rise, sold us out, then another rise and we bought back in.""


Chris also says the company has enough cash for 2 years. APP is coming out on Feb 22. 

CEO also said they have PPi hiring solutions which is already being used at many police stations. 

They are also in talks with other trading platforms for potential partnerships. This would be huge if they can close a few deals!!

Predictions: 

So I took the avg P/E ratio of all the big tech right now to project possible marketcap for DIGI based off of crypto app alone ... this will be in U.S. dollars because that is what the monthly subscription fees will be based on ....

10 thousand users ---

 10,000×$100/month = $12 million annual × 30 P/E = $360 million marketcap --- $2 / share 

100 thousand users --- 

 100,000×$100/month =  $120 million annual × 30 P/E  = $3.6 billion marketcap --- $20 / share

500 thousand users ---

500,000×$100/month = $600 million annual × 30 P/E = $18 billion marketcap ---  $100 / share

Now that was based on earnings and I know I used revenue projections but our earnings margin will be about 80% of revenue ... so with the U.S./CdN currency at about 25% say you can just call those price projections above  Canadian and it would even out ... so with this we can assume a low end on a measly 10 thou subscribers   will give us $2 / share and on the higher end of 500 thou users $100 / share with the conservative lower middle end being 100 thou users giving us $20 / share value ... incredible future value with any of these outcomes and shows why so much interest in volume and accumulation  mright now

719,NOVN," First off, I have a position in NOVN. Now that I’ve said that, some of this post doesn’t quite make sense to me.

Why would they analyze the data in small chunks? Isn’t the point of Phase 3 to have a larger group of people and to come to a conclusion from *all* of the data? Also, isn’t it going to be a matter of running computer programs to compute p-values and ratios and confidence intervals?

By that I mean, it doesn’t matter really what the data looks like for 50 or 100 people. The results could appear to be significant, but then after analyzing the data as a whole the result could actually be insignificant. Which is why you couldn’t really draw any conclusions until all of the data is collected.

Maybe you know something I don’t, and if you do then please educate me! Seriously. But I wouldn’t assume any interim analysis is taking place that will make it easier to analyze the complete data set. And I would think that any conclusions from interim analysis will ultimately be irrelevant when your final analysis is done.

Also, I’m not saying your time table is wrong. I’m just saying some of the reasoning here doesn’t make sense.",bluelemoncows,3,/r/pennystocks/comments/ln1ed2/novn_a_follow_up_to_my_recent_post_with_more/gny7zhr/,0.044,0.885,0.07,0.3781

723,ALL," This is an excellent point. Personally I am lucky to have a history in statistical analysis, mostly related to the biochemical side. When we were conducting experiments, it would be easier for us to complete trail entry in smaller chunks if we were running a longer term study (say 8+ months). This was so simply because no matter the outcome of future data, ALL data would be evaluated on the same basis. In the case of NOVN, the primary endpoint is clearance of all lesions by week 12. Let’s assume the approximate 60% of patients enrolled by end of last year have completed or will complete by March. NOVN could already extract valuable information from this 60% of data, to such a degree that they could extrapolate how the future trails will run and if they will show statistical significance. In the event where they waited to start analysis until all trails have completed (which they very well may do) they would not be able to appropriately plan or predict the future. 

At the end of the day, they will still need to lump all data together to run the ultimate P value test but the analysis of individual chunks can provide NOVN with important short term information. To such a degree, that if we see NOVN making positive material business decisions in the coming weeks, one may speculate that trial data is progressing well and showing positive efficacy. 

At the end of the day this is simply conjecture and I may be completely wrong. This is simply my personal opinions that I found interesting based on my own personal professional experience. Thank you for the counterpart to my logic as it helps us explain our ideas further.

725,NOVN," Yes, they signed an agreement with Catalent to help develop and formulate their Nitricil technology into a nasal spray.

726,NOVN," This is sound. My overall thesis is simply that interim analysis and conclusions will allow for an accelerated time frame from end of trails to release of PR.

LGHL meanwhile is barely above its IPO price. Price action on LGHL lately has been very bullish. And, despite SOS’s already large run-up, I do believe it has a lot further to go. We shall see!

Good morning!

I'm  a former army trauma surgeon, nowadays practicing in emergency, critical care and toxicology.  In this hospital system, Surgery and Emergency are completely separate departments and never the two shall cross.

Part 1, Qtrypta.

There are a fair number of  migraine meds out there including some new ones also that have been  approved in the last couple of years.  This includes:   Ubrelvy to treat  attacks, four new monoclonal antibodies targeting calcitonin  gene-related peptides.  Delivery varies, but small autoinjectors used once a month to prevent and ""ease up"" the severity.  Plus Reyvow  medicine to treat them, plus an armband Nerivio which is controlled by a  smart phone and designed to get the brain to relax.   Qtrytpa seems to  be coming, as are multiple nasal sprays of ergotamine, a combination  pill of  rizatriptan and meloxicam, a liquid form of  celecoxib,   rimegepant was approved last year.  Side note, Phase 3 trials are not redone without a reason and ""just because,"" regardless of what the press release says.  If it is to make their application stronger, it is because the First Phase 3 trial did not show strong enough evidence to have it approved in the first place...

https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?recrs=&cond=migraine&term=&cntry=&state=&city=&dist= (Lots of research, lots of stuff being worked on.  ie: competition)

https://www.drugs.com/medical-answers/new-drugs-treatment-prevention-migraine-3515053/

It's  a decent market, maybe close to 3bil worldwide.  They're going to fight  for a share, and regardless you're micro-stapling a bandaid.  The pump  advertisements lately have also been pushing the micro-needle patches  for covid vaccines, which is nuts.

Part 2, their micro-needle patches

One, the speculation of this for self-immunizing at home for covid is crazy.  A multi-use applicator and single-use micro-needle bandaids is going to be used where?  Antarctica research station?  Some very forward operating base in the mountains of Afghanistan?  On a submarine, at sea, on a year long patrol?

If  they worked at getting that patented drug delivery system to general  medication use - treating diabetics, seizures, asthma, etc... that could  be a game changer.   IF IF IF I saw anything saying they were trying to  even look at this for diabetic applications I would go ""cajones deep""  in a heartbeat.  I didn't see any reference to any clinical trials or pathways for that system for general or other use however.  I didn't see anything where they were trying to market that to ""big pharma"" for delivery of other medications.  I didn't see anything where ""big pharma"" wanted such a thing to use.  Could they  go that way?   Sure, and my wife might let me take Carrie Underwood as a second wife also as my next birthday present.

https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04066023?term=zosano&draw=2&rank=2

A Phase 2/3 with 42 participants is low numbers.  Practically unheard of.  Phase 2 should be 80-100, Phase 3 should be 300ish.  Started in October 2019, running through July 2021.

https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/results/NCT03282227?term=zosano&draw=2&rank=5

Phase 3, started with 342 participants, but 215 dropped out of the study for various reasons (15 for adverse events, 20 because they did not want to continue, 3 because Zosano said no, 2 because their doctor pulled them, and I am concerned about the 1 ""other."")  This actually explains why they are redoing the Phase 3... it wasn't completed by any accepted standard.   Now going down to the adverse affects... the microneedle patch is going to be a problem with anyone who is immune compromised, weak immune system, delicate/ fragile skin, is on any form of anticoagulant (blood thinner) medication, or has a bleeding disorder - and that's the minor effects.  The number of  Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders speaks to that.  Under serious adverse reactions, there are only 1 of each type so that may be irrelevant and not a bad side effect but it raises a potential red flag due to the number of them.  Go research Vioxx and why it was pulled off the market after being heavily sold for 5 years and there were lots of ""If you or a loved one"" advertisements on TV.

My  opinion:   The market is a saturated one for this and is also filled with ""big pharma"" who have much larger distribution systems and contracted connections with the large insurance and pharmacy chains.  Do you want to use sticky patches in your skin that leaves you sore and bleeding, or take once a month autoinjector shots,or  go for a quick dissolving tablet, or use a nasal spray for quick relief.  Not to mention the leaps made to prevent and ease them.  In looking over the research trials at ClinicalTrials.gov, Qtrypta has potential, but is currently not a contender for front-line medication yet and would have a fight to get into the core insurance-covered market.  The amount of skin side effects makes the microneedle patch questionable for the long term (or like I dream of it being applied daily for insulin)... but the number of skin side effects says that is not going to happen.  Nope.  I’m currently in 3 biotechs, this ain’t one.

But hey, you do you.  Unless you get too sick or hurt, in which case I do you.  Cheers and cheerios!",duTemplar,8,/r/pennystocks/comments/lnls9n/purchasing_zsan/go16uac/,0.08,0.828,0.092,0.8656

796,IMO," Stock prices don't always accurately reflect the true value of an enterprise. There could be a plethora of reasons why it has been flatlined for so long. IMO, the company operates primarily in a rural setting and perhaps the folks running it aren't as capital market attuned as execs in, say, Shanghai would be. Company PR is basically non existent, but that's not always a bad thing, - the execs might just be laser focused on building the business and managing operations instead of wondering what the price action will be tommorow.

At the end of the day, this is a convienience store chain with some operations in catering, crop commodities, and e-commerce solutions. It's definately not as ""sexy"" as many companies that have been hyped and it's been flying under the radar.
