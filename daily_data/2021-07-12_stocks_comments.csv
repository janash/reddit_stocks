If they were they wouldn't give them away for free. By all means, explore algo trading as a hobby, but don't expect to beat the market. There is a Reddit r/algotrading.

Any bot you can buy is a scam. 

Quant strategies exist, but ones that consistently beat the market aren't sold for a few hundred dollars on the internet :). They are developed by Ivy league Physics PhDs in hedge funds with immense resources and access to high quality lightning fast market data[1].

Hey, I have some pills that make you live longer, do you want to buy some?

13,MIT," >I plan on getting into trading since I really want to grow my savings. Sadly my 9-5 job doesn't give me enough time to study trading extensively, and I read that trading bots can help people in my situation. I want to ask your thoughts about trading bots, and here's some I've found in my research. Is trading with any of them worth it?








You're thinking about this completely backwards. 








First off, unless you know what you're doing you should not be actively trading but let's look past that to answer your question. 







The point of trading bots is to automate a strategy you have already figured out. If you don't have a strategy that you can do manually to make you money then a trading bot is completely pointless. 






You should be aware that you are completing with MIT PhD's and hedge funds to figure out these strategies so unless you think you're smarter than them you shouldn't pursue this. If you still want to continue then you'll need to either teach yourself a large percentage of undergrad level stats, finance, and econ (with a good bit of grad level)  or go get a PhD in finance from an Ivy.  
















As a side note, if you're smart enough to figure out a profitable strategy then you should be smart enough to learn how to code your own trading bot (even if you don't have a lot of coding experience) so you shouldn't even be using a 3rd party service.",caraissohot,10,/r/stocks/comments/oimiaf/are_trading_bots_worth_it/h4wxtsl/,0.013,0.87,0.117,0.977

Technology

I don’t think that their profitability has been hurt badly but I expect that you’re correct about interest levels. It’s a bit of a gamble but I bought some early on in the pandemic and I’m hoping that with the MAX issues ironed out (assuming MAX pilot training is improved in third-world airlines) confidence in the company and the stock improves. That said, there has also been an alarming amount of turnover in the company, so it’s a bit risky at this point in time.

I feel like this is a bit to speculatory to include as a ""pro"" for your DD.

>Carl Daikeler claims he doesn’t plan to sell a single share

Yes, I agree this one is speculatory. I put ""claims"" since I don't necessarily trust that promise to be kept. However, I put it in pros since it is at least a positive.

As for the short squeeze aspect, I was specifically saying I am NOT advocating or expecting a short squeeze. It is merely by the data that it is only technically a short squeeze candidate, just like any stock that is shorted by over 20%. I have presented that data for people who would like to examine that aspect.

Analysts haven't raised the PT, but rather have only just started putting out their PTs. Already these have been catalysts for the stock price rising, and as more add PTs, they may continue to be catalysts. Other potential catalysts will include PR. As mentioned in the DD, they have said they're planning to use most of their cash on hand to invest in marketing. Another potential catalyst will be the company's first earnings. At this point, much of the financials are relatively speculative based on information given to us by the company. Should the financials match up or be positive, it could be a big catalyst.

I understand your view on the bearish points. If I had included all that you ask it would have made for an extremely long post since there's so much to address. Here's a quick summary though. Competitors include - Peloton, Apple, iFiit/NordicTrack, FIIT, Nautilus. You can read more about the industry as a whole as well as details on the competitors in my PTON DD post.

I am not in the BODY stock with a view to it becoming the next Peloton, so I think it would be best compared to Nautilus or NordicTrack, and any other competitor aiming at the everyman. I only want it to double or triple in price although others are a lot more bullish than I am for the long-term. I personally don't expect it to dominate in future.

Where its edge is, is in the fact that it has a big headstart in its combo of subscribers, content and equipment. It also has a relationship with LA Fitness, giving LA Fitness, Esporta Fitness, and City Sports members the ability add OpenFit to their exiting gym membership. In this way, it has a similar advantage to Peloton albeit aiming at the ""everyman"" market rather than the ""health nut/upper class"" market.

On the bearish side of that, the threat is that if its other competitors can catch up, or if Peloton decides to aim at the ""everyman"" market (which it is likely to do in future), it will probably lose some market share. 

As for what they are struggling with, they previously struggled with moving with the times, and they also have the negative image of their MLM aspects. While they've had some big successes (like P90x), they fell behind in the online fitness market and weren't innovative enough. As to whether their current pivot will succeed, there's no guarantee which is where the risk comes in. 

Going public hasn't changed much yet as far as I can see, as they still need to prove themselves post-merger. Basically, it's early days, but I like it because the risk to reward ratio seems pretty good at this price.

I have one of their courses and I'm not financially invested. It's a good workout.

I wrote my PTON DD as it was dipping and, like you, I was also bullish about it, particularly about it recovering from the news about the child death (I actually mention it in my DD post). I''ve currently got 45 shares in PTON. Hopefully it keeps going up.

Please note in this DD, I have explained I'm not expecting this to be equal to PTON. I'm simply saying it's undervalued at its current stock price. I do, however, think it can compete with lower ""everyman"" competitors such as Nautilus since it is already doing so.

139,PTON," Thanks for your feedback. :)

I have one of their courses and I'm not financially invested. It's a good workout.

I wrote my PTON DD as it was dipping and, like you, I was also bullish about it, particularly about it recovering from the news about the child death (I actually mention it in my DD post). I''ve currently got 45 shares in PTON. Hopefully it keeps going up.

Please note in this DD, I have explained I'm not expecting this to be equal to PTON. I'm simply saying it's undervalued at its current stock price. I do, however, think it can compete with lower ""everyman"" competitors such as Nautilus since it is already doing so. The proof of that is in their current revenue and amount of subscribers which number 3.2 million.  I'm not looking at this as an innovative 5-10 year investment, but as a good stock to buy for turning a decent profit within the next few months or 1-2 years.

148,DD," I haven't done DD on Tonal, so I can't give a very educated answer. My first impression of it is that, I wouldn't personally be interested in it, but it could be good for people who are seriously into weightlifting. 

One con is the fact that it has no live classes or anyone monitoring your form. I think that would be important. Plus, having some variety and other people to compare your performance with. That's part of the draw of products like Peloton.

The other con is that any other company (like PTON) could also make weighlifting equipment and already have a bigger subscriber base.

Still, if they could get live classes in, I think that would be good, and perhaps they can get ahead in that sector before others catch up. The fitness industry is so big that there's always the chance that they could grab a slice of it. It would depend on your expectations. I think Peloton is most likely to dominate in future, but Tonal might be able to find a niche.

They have PIXAR and their own film studios, which Netflix lacks, meaning if you are a Star Wars fan by owning Disney+ you can get sneak peak type material.

309,SPCE," You state that it's your other 25% and it consists of weed stocks, SPCE, and something requiring FDA approval. Those stocks are highly volatile. High risk, high reward. SPCE has been on a tear the past few weeks so my guess is you purchased it months ago before it started tanking or tried to catch the momentum and got hit hard after the dump. Weed stocks is TBD. Highly volatile for obvious reasons. There's only so much DD you can do with these type of companies. You're basically putting your trust on their ability to have regulations passed, how successful their trials are, etc., Proven companies = easier to do DD because you have something to compare it to. Honestly, 25% is too much for highly volatile companies. I would drop it to 10%. Many of these companies are too reliant on factors that you cannot accurately do DD for.

310,SPCE," Based on the companies you mentioned, I think you have to think about their industry and what they are selling.

Example the space industry is about pouring billions into research and hoping for massive government contracts. SPCE touts commercial flights. But there will be few can afford it and many who are gonna wait to see how safe it is. I doubt their current business model can cover their expenses. Which is why they are going to sell 500M in stock.

Weed is an industry that will kill. But at this point there are 100s of players fighting for a spot. Some of which just spend in hopes to push competition out. There is too much unknown.

When I started investing I only traded in the Fortune 500. Since then I let myself invest 10% in other companies. Been investing 7 years, and that 10% is still nothing more than a gamble.

346,FUBO," My drawdown risk is lower because I'm selling ITM calls against the positions. I can sustain 10-20% corrections on the underlying pretty easily, assuming it happens over 1-2 weeks and not all in one night.

As an example, I just exited a FUBO position a few minutes ago. I was in from July 6th until today. In that time, FUBO lost $0.50 (1.7%) per share while I profited $0.13 (0.45%) per share.

That's a really modest return, one of my worst positions so far (92 out of 104 (based off Profit % Per Day, actually) but it's a reasonable example of why my drawdown isn't really a concern. I did this with a $24.50 call sold against the position so even with the underlying losing a couple percent, I wasn't really stressed for at least another 10% over the next 11 days. Obviously if it fell 10% tomorrow I would have had concerns but I don't have the same degree of exposure as you're assuming.

347,TSLA," I’m not 100% sure but I’d assume it’s because book value (which is assets - liabilities) is the current “value” of a company whereas price per share (and thus market cap) is a forward looking metric. 

If a company were to liquidate all assets, pay back all debts (liabilities), the remaining value is the companies book value. Book value per share (BVPS) is Book value/shares outstanding. This number is how much value of the company owning one share gets you. 

P/B ratio is price per share / BVPS

While book value is an accounting metric based on real numbers, price per share is based on investor speculation. Look at a company like Tesla for example. TSLA is notorious for trading at an inflated P/E (price/earnings) ratio. While the company wasn’t making much (actually it was losing money) investors were betting on the future of TSLA. Thus, P/B ratio of TSLA is extremely high. 

Stock price is affected by a billion things — news, short squeeze, social media, pump and dumps, speculation, hopes, etc. Book value is concrete. 

TSLA may have been trading at 800 bucks per share and had a near trillion dollar valuation, but the company simply isn’t worth that much if you look at book value, thus no one would purchase TSLA for their market cap.",Btwn3n20charachters,1,/r/stocks/comments/oiosjg/why_do_companies_have_high_pb_ratios/h4wqhsb/,0.071,0.692,0.237,0.9914

I mean it's very clearly an improvement in the experience. I don't know why you would argue against that.

Headsets are cumbersome today I agree, but Facebook has shown research on a VR sunglasses display system as a long-term project that would be paired with their CTRL-Labs BCI wrist-band.

This is why you're wrong when you talk about how even a pair of glasses is not enough. Because it would perform all the functions of any device you use today, but do so in a more convenient and more immersive way. For example, instead of needing a workstation desk with physical monitors and a keyboard, you could lie in bed, simulate a virtual office, and type as fast as you do on a keyboard just using the BCI wrist-band.

If you wanted to invite colleagues around, you could do so with avatars, which would be more socially engaging, better for productivity, and wouldn't come with any Zoom fatigue that people have had to deal with the past year or so.

Not to mention the glasses will offer AR functionality and be able to freely blend between it and VR, so the sensory deprivation comment doesn't match up with how the tech is evolving.",DarthBuzzard,0,/r/stocks/comments/oieffr/what_is_the_most_misunderstood_company_in_that/h4y9pte/,0.054,0.849,0.097,0.7873
