351,GSAT," So, I put a stop loss order for GSAT at 1.30 yesterday and noticed it fired despite every chart I look at never going below 1.31. What happened, and is there a way to make them compensate for the lost profits since GSAT went up in that time?",MarlinClock,0,/r/RobinHood/comments/ng1nd2/daily_discussion_thread_may_19th_2021/gyos60q/,0.207,0.738,0.055,-0.793
352,GME," The problem with selling covered calls on volatile meme stocks is that you need to put a large portion of your capital into shares of volatile meme stocks.

Like what happens when one of these volatile meme stocks does a volatility and now you're either looking at 'losing' a fuck ton of money because you capped your gains at literally $100, or it takes a sudden shit and now your shares are down heavily, where you're either forced to ride it out or purchase your call back at higher IV (which will still likely be less, but considering you were getting peanuts to begin with). For a few measly bucks you're trading all of the upside of owning a volatile meme stock for all of the downside, literally.

The inherent contradiction is that you're purchasing volatile stocks in the hope that they don't act volatile. You're trying to get around that by reducing the length of the contract but that just drastically decreases your premium. It's a great illustration of ""options are priced efficiently"" though, and a great recipe for getting into a losing spiral or simply getting piss poor return on your capital.

That's the problem with these ""works until it doesn't"" strats. You convince yourself you're a genius on the money train because 9/10 times you are, but that 10th time will wipe you out. Pennies and steam rollers and all that.

As an aside, I've noticed this weird disease in these new investor forums where people put way too much emphasis on things that return cash while ignoring things like opportunity cost or alpha. You're talking about dividends and weekly returns while seemingly ignoring the idea of just putting that $16k of GME into in a company that might actually be worth something in the future.",ttsbuttsbuttsbutts,1,/r/RobinHood/comments/nfy4ly/anyone_want_to_critique_my_trading_strat_please/gyqp41y/,0.117,0.78,0.103,-0.4446
