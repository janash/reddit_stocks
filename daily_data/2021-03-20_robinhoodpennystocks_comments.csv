19,ITP," ITP might shoot up this week...
This paper company is having a conference call to announce it’s 4th quarter earnings of last year on Tuesday March 23. The stock is currently priced at .74. Prior to the GameStop craze, the stock was shooting up and got to 1.44 and at the time investors were saying it was projected to go to about 2.00 this year. I believe it’s a good opportunity for short term investors seeing as it has a good chance of increasing after the conference and even if takes a lost it won’t be by much. It also looks like a good opportunity for long term investors cause the company is projected to increase 20% in the next 5 years.

Webull’s comment sections have the exact same problems although they’re not *QUITE* as horrendous. (You do often see political trash on more popular tickers though).

24,JP," From Heska's 10-K: **Item 3.Legal Proceedings**

*From  time to time, the Company may be involved in litigation relating to  claims arising out of its operations. The Company records accruals for  outstanding legal matters when it believes it is probable that a loss  will be incurred, and the amount can be reasonably estimated.*

*As  of December 31, 2020, we were not a party to any legal proceedings that  are expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a material  adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating  results.* 

Apparently they don't anticipate losing this case. However, they also recently made an offering for $200M to JP Morgan and Piper Sandler, so they may be running short on cash. 

As for Zomedica et al, the motion to dismiss is just matter of course. If you don't even ask for that you are a pretty crap lawyer. I'm more intrigued as to what Heska got struck from the defense response. The indemnity agreement seems a little sketch, but it may have been a proactive measure by Qorvo in anticipation of this case, in which case they knew they would be a party to it anyway.

I'm not able to pull up much with regards to the legal matters at hand, but I have found that mediators have been appointed and discovery agreements have been reached. Zomedica has a larger market cap, and Qorvo dwarfs both of them, so whoever has the most cash is probably going to win.

I'm not really concerned, Heska didn't come up with the idea for disposable testing cartridges nor were they the only ones who could work with Qorvo. I don't see this going anywhere in Heska's favor, and if anyone is going to be held liable Qorvo seems like it's going to foot the bill anyway.",WhatnotSoforth,4,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/m9bmxj/heska_corporation_legal_proceedings_against_zom/grm8cwz/,0.04,0.828,0.132,0.9734
25,BCRX," $BCRX RECAP THREAD AHEAD OF R&D DAY:

Before beginning, let’s have a moment of silence for Alexion because they are getting whacked on R&D Day and Sheridan is ordering the hit… don’t you see the real agenda behind KOLs and a REAL-TIME PATIENT all giving their perspectives on 9930 in a discussion panel? It’s going to be all about the C5 inhibitor comparative analyses. You think he’d orchestrate this if the data wasn’t blockbuster? This panel is nothing but Sheridan setting up the gallows for Alexion, I mean who better to announce the death sentence to Alexion’s cash cows other than physicians and patients themselves…. the stage has been set to deliver the killing blow, what an absolute power move ♟ Now, onto the bullish fundamental signals that have reared their heads over the past 3 days:

**1)    Apellis Pharma’s Unimpressive PNH data**

I made an earlier post discussing this in-detail on this both on ST and on Reddit, which you can find here ([https://www.reddit.com/r/BCRX/comments/m7l8ui/bcrx\_vs\_apls\_apellis\_pharma\_just\_published\_their/](https://www.reddit.com/r/BCRX/comments/m7l8ui/bcrx_vs_apls_apellis_pharma_just_published_their/)) and here ([https://stocktwits.com/ThirdEyeHoldings/message/305417746](https://stocktwits.com/ThirdEyeHoldings/message/305417746)). However, what I would like to add here is that I think I finally figured out why I felt the hemoglobin efficacy was suspect. The 2.7 g/dl improvement that was reported in December 2020 was their 48-week efficacy rate, while the 3.8 g/dl they most recently showcased in their article that they had published in the New England Medical Journal was a 16-week efficacy rate. Let that sink in… their treatment is not durable for patients! Sure, we can’t deny that 2.7 g/dl offers a benefit to patients but my earlier posts mention allllll the side effects that come along in the fine print if patients are prescribed pegcetacoplan. My point is, their article was honestly quite misleading and it goes to show how they know they won’t be the best-in-class PNH treatment on the market. I view pegcetacoplan as a non-issue from a competitive standpoint.

**2)    $95M whale blocks printing at EOD today** 

The institutional whales had their vacuum on all day and soaked up nearly half of today’s trading volume to accumulate additional positions of over 7 million shares by EOD. Looks like the initial $61M block we all noticed was just one of two megablocks that brings the total large print to $95M.... the math now says nearly 60% of today's trading volume aka 7 million shares were locked away by institutions robbing short-sighted retail/tutes. My personal theory? Either Denner is racing to 10% ownership by himself or he called up some friends and the whole entourage had a field day today. If Denner didn’t accumulate solo and I had to wager a bet on his partner, it’d most likely be RA Capital. They have a great working relationship and were the dynamic duo over at ITRM. They bought in and sold out in step with one another RA could have joined us for the long haul here.

**3)    Dr. Helen Thackray joining BioCryst as Chief R&D Officer** 

You gotta appreciate the power play here of announcing a Chief R&D Officer the day before R&D Day. Dr. Helen Thackray will most likely be introduced to us after they walk through 9930 data readout. The way I see it, readout will be exemplary of current pipeline’s success and Thackray’s introduction will be the inauguration for the bright future of our pipeline! Also, a different angle to look at this appointment through... who will be the new Board Director that replaces Dr. Thackray? Good corporate governance policies will usually avoid senior executives outside of the CEO from being on the board to mitigate collusion/bias in decision-making. Denner could be a real candidate here, he’s not a corporate raider and his activist investing style for the benefit of shareholders will serve both the Company and us well. Regardless of who it ends up being, looking forward to the newest addition to our outstanding Board!

**4)     Withdrawal of EMA Orphan Drug Designation** 

We received word yesterday that BioCryst was withdrawing their EMA Orphan Drug Designation application. This happened because our current patents ALREADY provides exclusivity in the EU till 2039, while the EMA Orphan Drug Designation would only cover us till 2031. So it's redundant bureaucracy that would be a waste of time and that's why it was withdrawn. The 8-K filing changes nothing, I actually see this as an update that implies they're wrapping formalities up. Let's take a step back and analyze this timeline. EMA meeting for Orladeyo happened a few days ago... we immediately get a regulatory update 8-K filing today that reduces the hoops we have to jump through and confirms we have EU exclusivity and essentially a monopoly till 2039 🧐... EMA is moving fast and cutting fluff to fly through formalities, they want Orladeyo available asap - approval will be coming in very soon.

**5)    JP Morgan & Chase upgrades PT by 50% from $10 to $15** 

Seriously though, what a waste of time/effort... JPM put in all the work to write up and send their clients an equity research report three trading days before R&D Day with a $15 PT that doesn’t even incorporate 9930... Managing Directors there must be ruthless, analysts will be burning the midnight oil next weekend incorporating 9930’s value and pulling all nighters authoring a new report with higher PT 😂 Looking forward to the PT hikes across the board from our institutional coverage base in the coming days.

***Let me conclude with two final messages ahead of our biggest inflection point since Orladeyo approval:***

1. It is NOT healthy to set price expectations for Monday... this isn’t about a quick gap to $20. This data readout will unlatch us from the $12-$14 range for good and we will rise to a new floor in the coming weeks somewhere between $17-$20 that we will hold with strength. As investors, we want sustainable growth... not pump and dump movement. That being said, I can also be completely wrong and this goes vertical and holds but at the end of the day, sustained growth is paramount and we shouldn’t be mentally setting ourselves up for disappointment by expecting hockey stick movement.
2. I think people forget probably the only real but most important power that retail holds: education. Conducting due diligence and educating the fickle-minded retail market is tough. Look at how much we suffered last year at the hands of institutional manipulation. But… as DD contributors continued providing a steady drumbeat of due diligence and retail investors began realizing what they were really looking at, the selling volume exponentially decreased over time as we stopped falling for institutional suppression and we even began forcing institutions to begin covering their hedges. One can’t deny that the covering was also sparked in part by inflection points like approvals, partnerships, etc, BUT we do have power. We have the power of defending our collective investment by educating those around us and protecting fellow retail investors from having their precious shares stolen. Don’t ever take this for granted and do whatever you can to contribute towards helping open the eyes of others!

Have a great weekend and cheers to the beginning of a monstrous move upward in 2021!

The way I see it, readout will be exemplary of current pipeline’s success and Thackray’s introduction will be the inauguration for the bright future of our pipeline! Also, a different angle to look at this appointment through... who will be the new Board Director that replaces Dr. Thackray? Good corporate governance policies will usually avoid senior executives outside of the CEO from being on the board to mitigate collusion/bias in decision-making. Denner could be a real candidate here, he’s not a corporate raider and his activist investing style for the benefit of shareholders will serve both the Company and us well. Regardless of who it ends up being, looking forward to the newest addition to our outstanding Board!

**4)     Withdrawal of EMA Orphan Drug Designation** 

We received word yesterday that BioCryst was withdrawing their EMA Orphan Drug Designation application. This happened because our current patents ALREADY provides exclusivity in the EU till 2039, while the EMA Orphan Drug Designation would only cover us till 2031. So it's redundant bureaucracy that would be a waste of time and that's why it was withdrawn. The 8-K filing changes nothing, I actually see this as an update that implies they're wrapping formalities up. Let's take a step back and analyze this timeline. EMA meeting for Orladeyo happened a few days ago... we immediately get a regulatory update 8-K filing today that reduces the hoops we have to jump through and confirms we have EU exclusivity and essentially a monopoly till 2039 🧐... EMA is moving fast and cutting fluff to fly through formalities, they want Orladeyo available asap - approval will be coming in very soon.

**5)    JP Morgan & Chase upgrades PT by 50% from $10 to $15** 

Seriously though, what a waste of time/effort... JPM put in all the work to write up and send their clients an equity research report three trading days before R&D Day with a $15 PT that doesn’t even incorporate 9930... Managing Directors there must be ruthless, analysts will be burning the midnight oil next weekend incorporating 9930’s value and pulling all nighters authoring a new report with higher PT 😂 Looking forward to the PT hikes across the board from our institutional coverage base in the coming days.

***Let me conclude with two final messages ahead of our biggest inflection point since Orladeyo approval:***

1. It is NOT healthy to set price expectations for Monday... this isn’t about a quick gap to $20. This data readout will unlatch us from the $12-$14 range for good and we will rise to a new floor in the coming weeks somewhere between $17-$20 that we will hold with strength. As investors, we want sustainable growth... not pump and dump movement. That being said, I can also be completely wrong and this goes vertical and holds but at the end of the day, sustained growth is paramount and we shouldn’t be mentally setting ourselves up for disappointment by expecting hockey stick movement.
2. I think people forget probably the only real but most important power that retail holds: education. Conducting due diligence and educating the fickle-minded retail market is tough. Look at how much we suffered last year at the hands of institutional manipulation. But… as DD contributors continued providing a steady drumbeat of due diligence and retail investors began realizing what they were really looking at, the selling volume exponentially decreased over time as we stopped falling for institutional suppression and we even began forcing institutions to begin covering their hedges. One can’t deny that the covering was also sparked in part by inflection points like approvals, partnerships, etc, BUT we do have power. We have the power of defending our collective investment by educating those around us and protecting fellow retail investors from having their precious shares stolen. Don’t ever take this for granted and do whatever you can to contribute towards helping open the eyes of others!

Have a great weekend and cheers to the beginning of a monstrous move upward in 2021!

28,ITRM," $BCRX RECAP THREAD AHEAD OF R&D DAY:

Before beginning, let’s have a moment of silence for Alexion because they are getting whacked on R&D Day and Sheridan is ordering the hit… don’t you see the real agenda behind KOLs and a REAL-TIME PATIENT all giving their perspectives on 9930 in a discussion panel? It’s going to be all about the C5 inhibitor comparative analyses. You think he’d orchestrate this if the data wasn’t blockbuster? This panel is nothing but Sheridan setting up the gallows for Alexion, I mean who better to announce the death sentence to Alexion’s cash cows other than physicians and patients themselves…. the stage has been set to deliver the killing blow, what an absolute power move ♟ Now, onto the bullish fundamental signals that have reared their heads over the past 3 days:

**1)    Apellis Pharma’s Unimpressive PNH data**

I made an earlier post discussing this in-detail on this both on ST and on Reddit, which you can find here ([https://www.reddit.com/r/BCRX/comments/m7l8ui/bcrx\_vs\_apls\_apellis\_pharma\_just\_published\_their/](https://www.reddit.com/r/BCRX/comments/m7l8ui/bcrx_vs_apls_apellis_pharma_just_published_their/)) and here ([https://stocktwits.com/ThirdEyeHoldings/message/305417746](https://stocktwits.com/ThirdEyeHoldings/message/305417746)). However, what I would like to add here is that I think I finally figured out why I felt the hemoglobin efficacy was suspect. The 2.7 g/dl improvement that was reported in December 2020 was their 48-week efficacy rate, while the 3.8 g/dl they most recently showcased in their article that they had published in the New England Medical Journal was a 16-week efficacy rate. Let that sink in… their treatment is not durable for patients! Sure, we can’t deny that 2.7 g/dl offers a benefit to patients but my earlier posts mention allllll the side effects that come along in the fine print if patients are prescribed pegcetacoplan. My point is, their article was honestly quite misleading and it goes to show how they know they won’t be the best-in-class PNH treatment on the market. I view pegcetacoplan as a non-issue from a competitive standpoint.

**2)    $95M whale blocks printing at EOD today** 

The institutional whales had their vacuum on all day and soaked up nearly half of today’s trading volume to accumulate additional positions of over 7 million shares by EOD. Looks like the initial $61M block we all noticed was just one of two megablocks that brings the total large print to $95M.... the math now says nearly 60% of today's trading volume aka 7 million shares were locked away by institutions robbing short-sighted retail/tutes. My personal theory? Either Denner is racing to 10% ownership by himself or he called up some friends and the whole entourage had a field day today. If Denner didn’t accumulate solo and I had to wager a bet on his partner, it’d most likely be RA Capital. They have a great working relationship and were the dynamic duo over at ITRM. They bought in and sold out in step with one another RA could have joined us for the long haul here.

This data readout will unlatch us from the $12-$14 range for good and we will rise to a new floor in the coming weeks somewhere between $17-$20 that we will hold with strength. As investors, we want sustainable growth... not pump and dump movement. That being said, I can also be completely wrong and this goes vertical and holds but at the end of the day, sustained growth is paramount and we shouldn’t be mentally setting ourselves up for disappointment by expecting hockey stick movement.
2. I think people forget probably the only real but most important power that retail holds: education. Conducting due diligence and educating the fickle-minded retail market is tough. Look at how much we suffered last year at the hands of institutional manipulation. But… as DD contributors continued providing a steady drumbeat of due diligence and retail investors began realizing what they were really looking at, the selling volume exponentially decreased over time as we stopped falling for institutional suppression and we even began forcing institutions to begin covering their hedges. One can’t deny that the covering was also sparked in part by inflection points like approvals, partnerships, etc, BUT we do have power. We have the power of defending our collective investment by educating those around us and protecting fellow retail investors from having their precious shares stolen. Don’t ever take this for granted and do whatever you can to contribute towards helping open the eyes of others!

Have a great weekend and cheers to the beginning of a monstrous move upward in 2021!

32,RA," $BCRX RECAP THREAD AHEAD OF R&D DAY:

Before beginning, let’s have a moment of silence for Alexion because they are getting whacked on R&D Day and Sheridan is ordering the hit… don’t you see the real agenda behind KOLs and a REAL-TIME PATIENT all giving their perspectives on 9930 in a discussion panel? It’s going to be all about the C5 inhibitor comparative analyses. You think he’d orchestrate this if the data wasn’t blockbuster? This panel is nothing but Sheridan setting up the gallows for Alexion, I mean who better to announce the death sentence to Alexion’s cash cows other than physicians and patients themselves…. the stage has been set to deliver the killing blow, what an absolute power move ♟ Now, onto the bullish fundamental signals that have reared their heads over the past 3 days:

**1)    Apellis Pharma’s Unimpressive PNH data**

I made an earlier post discussing this in-detail on this both on ST and on Reddit, which you can find here ([https://www.reddit.com/r/BCRX/comments/m7l8ui/bcrx\_vs\_apls\_apellis\_pharma\_just\_published\_their/](https://www.reddit.com/r/BCRX/comments/m7l8ui/bcrx_vs_apls_apellis_pharma_just_published_their/)) and here ([https://stocktwits.com/ThirdEyeHoldings/message/305417746](https://stocktwits.com/ThirdEyeHoldings/message/305417746)). However, what I would like to add here is that I think I finally figured out why I felt the hemoglobin efficacy was suspect. The 2.7 g/dl improvement that was reported in December 2020 was their 48-week efficacy rate, while the 3.8 g/dl they most recently showcased in their article that they had published in the New England Medical Journal was a 16-week efficacy rate. Let that sink in… their treatment is not durable for patients! Sure, we can’t deny that 2.7 g/dl offers a benefit to patients but my earlier posts mention allllll the side effects that come along in the fine print if patients are prescribed pegcetacoplan. My point is, their article was honestly quite misleading and it goes to show how they know they won’t be the best-in-class PNH treatment on the market. I view pegcetacoplan as a non-issue from a competitive standpoint.

**2)    $95M whale blocks printing at EOD today** 

The institutional whales had their vacuum on all day and soaked up nearly half of today’s trading volume to accumulate additional positions of over 7 million shares by EOD. Looks like the initial $61M block we all noticed was just one of two megablocks that brings the total large print to $95M.... the math now says nearly 60% of today's trading volume aka 7 million shares were locked away by institutions robbing short-sighted retail/tutes. My personal theory? Either Denner is racing to 10% ownership by himself or he called up some friends and the whole entourage had a field day today. If Denner didn’t accumulate solo and I had to wager a bet on his partner, it’d most likely be RA Capital. They have a great working relationship and were the dynamic duo over at ITRM. They bought in and sold out in step with one another RA could have joined us for the long haul here.

**3)    Dr. Helen Thackray joining BioCryst as Chief R&D Officer** 

You gotta appreciate the power play here of announcing a Chief R&D Officer the day before R&D Day. Dr. Helen Thackray will most likely be introduced to us after they walk through 9930 data readout. The way I see it, readout will be exemplary of current pipeline’s success and Thackray’s introduction will be the inauguration for the bright future of our pipeline! Also, a different angle to look at this appointment through... who will be the new Board Director that replaces Dr. Thackray? Good corporate governance policies will usually avoid senior executives outside of the CEO from being on the board to mitigate collusion/bias in decision-making. Denner could be a real candidate here, he’s not a corporate raider and his activist investing style for the benefit of shareholders will serve both the Company and us well. Regardless of who it ends up being, looking forward to the newest addition to our outstanding Board!

**4)     Withdrawal of EMA Orphan Drug Designation** 

We received word yesterday that BioCryst was withdrawing their EMA Orphan Drug Designation application. This happened because our current patents ALREADY provides exclusivity in the EU till 2039, while the EMA Orphan Drug Designation would only cover us till 2031. So it's redundant bureaucracy that would be a waste of time and that's why it was withdrawn. The 8-K filing changes nothing, I actually see this as an update that implies they're wrapping formalities up. Let's take a step back and analyze this timeline. EMA meeting for Orladeyo happened a few days ago... we immediately get a regulatory update 8-K filing today that reduces the hoops we have to jump through and confirms we have EU exclusivity and essentially a monopoly till 2039 🧐... EMA is moving fast and cutting fluff to fly through formalities, they want Orladeyo available asap - approval will be coming in very soon.

**5)    JP Morgan & Chase upgrades PT by 50% from $10 to $15** 

Seriously though, what a waste of time/effort... JPM put in all the work to write up and send their clients an equity research report three trading days before R&D Day with a $15 PT that doesn’t even incorporate 9930... Managing Directors there must be ruthless, analysts will be burning the midnight oil next weekend incorporating 9930’s value and pulling all nighters authoring a new report with higher PT 😂 Looking forward to the PT hikes across the board from our institutional coverage base in the coming days.

34,TEVA, Lol any pharma co with adhd meds is a winner in my book since demand isn’t going anywhere! I bought some TEVA (a good generic adderall) calls a while back (not a penny stock sorry) for 4/16 that I need to roll out to exam/back to school season,poshernextdoor,1,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/m95ejp/am_i_an_idiot_or_a_genius_neos_option_yesterday/grl9hae/,0.03,0.775,0.195,0.8516
35,NEOS," No the strike is no longer 2.50.

Just looked at the merger details, it looks like each share of NEOS is cashed out at .108 of a share of aytu. This means your adjusted strike will probably be around 25$, and only worth about 10 shares not 100. Could be wrong but the occ adjusts all options proportionally with stock splits and mergers. This actually benefits you a lot, as now the contracts are not very liquid, so the person who bought them will have a hard time selling. I would wait for a message from your brokerage about the exact new strike price of the stock, but either way because it’s a covered call, you will make money",msJensen1995,5,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/m95ejp/am_i_an_idiot_or_a_genius_neos_option_yesterday/grl9b0m/,0.091,0.816,0.093,0.3182

I bought a few more April calls today on discount and bought some shares at 8.85. It'll hit 10 at least by EOW.  Mark my words, Ill happily eat shit in the discussion thread if im wrong lol

I dont think it gets much attention here because technically its not a penny stock anymore  , but fuck it was literally 30 cents a share in December.

I'm thinking about writing up a speculative DD on it just to keep myself busy--- in the words of DFV, I like the stock.

43,WKEY," I finally got out of Ocugen and Palantir to play the WKEY run the other day. That being said I think swings might be good in that NFT hype right now. They strike me (a still relatively new trader/investor) as similar to the blockchain stocks that are going to swing during off hours and during market as well. 

Back to ocugen though, I think they have great potential to moon (I hate that I just used that as a verb but these subs have influenced me more than I’d like to admit) if they release their data and get EUA in the US. That being said I’ll buy in again below $9 if some of my other stocks hit my PTs this week.",OUOhYeah2016,1,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/m8ukx4/top_swing_play/grlirl4/,0.029,0.881,0.09,0.778

45,OCGN," I've just recently started investing in general, but CSPs are definitely a good way to enter a position (if that's your goal) but they can also be used to generate income on their own if you're confident they won't expire ITM. I was certain that OCGN wouldn't drop past $5 before 3/19 so I could have made an easy $175 for every $500 collateral I put up, but I didn't want to realize any losses on my other positions so I didn't do it.. Looking back, I would have instantly recouped any losses I had and made some money on top of it. Downside is you're locking up all that collateral until your option expires or you buy to close the position, so in some cases you might be better off just owning stock in the company.",ICA_Agent47,1,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/m8ukx4/top_swing_play/grmobd6/,0.071,0.756,0.173,0.948
