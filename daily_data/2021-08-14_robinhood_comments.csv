0,PM," Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the Sesen Halt yesterday:

2:10:40 PM EST: The stock is currently trading at $5.90 and is halted with the halt code T1. A T1 halt occurs when there is about to be significant news released about a company. During this time shares cannot be traded and quotes will not be updated. With biotech companies like Sesen, this usually means that there is going to be a large announcement about one of their drug trials. At this point everyone is expecting news on the FDA acceptance of their Vicineum product.

2:40 PM EST: News is announced that the FDA did not approve the Biologics License Application for Vicineum. Bad news for the company. Stock is most likely going to take a large hit when trading opens back up. Quotes are set to start showing at 3:05 and trading will open back up at 3:10.

3:05 PM: Quotes begin to show and prices are under a dollar. 

3:10 PM: The stock opens back up and 6.78 M shares are traded over the next 15 seconds with the price ending up at $0.86.

3:10:15 PM: The stock is halted again. This time with code LULP (Limit Up Limit Down). This occurs when the stock moves a significant amount in a short amount of time. In this case the stock was shooting upwards from its new opening price after the halt.

3:20:15 PM: The stock open again, now at $1.21 and is open for 16 seconds before being halted again.

These LULP halts continue until the market close and the stock eventually reaches a peak of about $2.10

These halts have nothing to do with Robinhood. The halts that occurred were completely normal and nothing illegal occurred when you were not allowed to trade shares. When you placed your sell order for $5.90 the stock had already been halted and your shares were sold at the market price when the halt stopped which was the $0.70 you referenced in your post.",PristineAlpha,2,/r/RobinHood/comments/p3ybyj/can_someone_help_me_out_i_believe_robinhood_has/h8xrhj7/,0.016,0.918,0.065,0.9122
