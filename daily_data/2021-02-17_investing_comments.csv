In any case, I highly recommend the recently released interview they did with CNBC; lots of insight into the early days of Tesla:

22,CEO," That's what I mean. I would like to see what they have in assets, accesible cash... Because of all the richest guys (Buffett, Bezos), I think most of them are richer than Musk is, at least in assts. Yes, the shares in Musk's companies are very valuable... but they all depend on Musk being healthy and alive. The shares of Berkshire Hathaway will take a plunge, but survive Buffett's death. Amazon will of course would survive Bezos' disappearance. Tesla, though? If something happens to Musk (and I pray for that not to happen and I'm an atheist), Tesla shares would sink until a new CEO was announced. The company would survive at this point, but the market valuation at $850, certainly would not. Surprisingly, I think SpaceX would very easily survive, since there's Gwynne Shotwell and she's well known enough.   


So, yeah, Musk is rich, but I do not think he is by any means the richest in the world, considering how overvalued his stock is (I agree with it being overvalued, what they are doing is great and necessary and if it costs money, so be it). I think the valuation of Tesla is way too volatile to take it that seriously.",Waitwhatwhich,1,/r/investing/comments/lljcbq/elon_musks_spacex_raised_850_million_jumping/gnqxh7o/,0.041,0.719,0.24,0.9919

31,TV," Well, they probably could stream Netflix without paying Comcast, but of course they will have to pay SpaceX instead.

I looked at them and for me they would be a more expensive option.  However, I have the choice of multiple ISPs and access to high-bandwidth, as I live in a US suburb.  Those with more limited options are more likely to find SpaceX attractive.

As far as jamming goes - it is certainly possible, but also the sort of thing that isn't very desirable internationally.  I could see a country like China or Russia maybe doing it (though really I could also see SpaceX just cutting a deal with them).  

The problems with this sort of jamming are:

* It is hard to do against the ground stations, since there are many of them all over the place and getting LOS to them is difficult.

* It is easy to do against the satellites (few of them, and easy to get LOS), but when you do it you're potentially blocking access to it outside your jurisdiction (if you're a smaller country or you try to cover your border areas).  

* Doing it against the satellites themselves, especially civilian ones, is a bit of a provocation.  Messing with spy satellites is a game everybody has probably played at some point.  Messing with civilian communications satellites usually is off-limits.

If a country like China starts jamming SpaceX satellites when they're overhead, what is to stop somebody from jamming a Chinese-launched satellite in geosync just about anywhere?  How about weather satellites?  That sort of thing can get really expensive fast, as most people aren't hardening civilian satellites against state-level attacks.  

The threat is of course always there, so that may result in a lot of diplomatic-level dealmaking, which will end up trickling down to SpaceX and others in this business.  They won't talk about it publicly, but they simply won't offer services that breach whatever compromise is brokered.

What nations might do instead of jamming is getting more serious about policing their citizens.  An aircraft at high altitude could probably locate any dishes talking to Starlink, and then they can just do whatever it is they do when people do things the government doesn't like.  That sort of thing is hard to do with broadcast TV and so on, but much easier against 2-way communications like internet traffic.",rich000,1,/r/investing/comments/lljcbq/elon_musks_spacex_raised_850_million_jumping/gnsr3do/,0.088,0.827,0.085,0.5593

They seem to be having somewhat of an identity crisis going forward as a tech company, and that's understandable given what they specialize in. They have so much capital, but they make half to 3/4 efforts of using it to for anything, because they're seemingly late to the party, be it on streaming, EV, etc.

They can't seem to land a deal with a good company on EV (Hyundai would have been absolutely ideal), and so here we are with the same apple products out that everyone knows and is familiar with, with competition on a roughly equal playing field.

The good news for them is how they have negotiated contracts with cell phone companies to keep allowing new purchases of phones - the ""free"" upgrade. They need to continue to push free months of apple TV on those new phone plans, and hopefully put out some good streaming content.

As for EV, I'm not sure where they should go. Starting from scratch would be ideal from a control perspective, but crazy from a cost perspective.

Brown energy producers — I’m looking at who is making a successful transition to green energy, or who is producing something that the green economy will continue to rely on during the transition. You look at players like RWEOY who were as dirty as anyone who are now leaning hard into wind production—definite value there. 

Telecom—the market still doesn’t appreciate how pivotal companies like T and VZ will be as more and more of our lives are dependent on high speed internet access. We are still in the very early stages of Internet ubiquity even though it feels like we’ve reached a mature market where access is a commodity. There will be a day sooner than any of us think where having the fastest, most reliable internet will be more important than having a college degree. As VR and AR put more demands on internet infrastructure, telecom will hold a lot of strings.

My opinion is that the best time to open a new position is always today. I think based on the odds, it's a terrible decision to try and wait for a correction - you'll likely be staring at a new ATH when 3-4 months rolls around.

All time highs are usually followed by additional ATHs. Don't overthink it. You know you're not smarter than the market, so don't try and time it. Put it in and forget about it for 5+ years.

157,APHA," I do think the Canadian companies are better set to take advantage of the American market than their US counterparts. The Canadian companies have had access to national and international investments for years. As a consequence, they've built the infrastructure needed to meet the American demand quickly and amassed a surplus of product, which I believe is intentional in order to flood the American market as soon as possible.

While American companies may have an advantage due to future federal regulations, this may not be enough to put them over the Canadians. Tilray has already been active in the international market and Aphria even has a foot in the door with their acquisition of Sweetwater.

Ultimately, what's more difficult: acquiring investment and building infrastructure or fighting through red tape?

I am getting ready to open an account on fidelity (part of the exodus from Robinhood) but I’m tripped up and confused on one of the last questions while opening. It reads: 

Certify your taxpayer identification number.
Under penalties of perjury, you certify that:
1. The Social Security number or taxpayer identification number you have provided is correct (or you are waiting for a number to be issued to you); and
2. Unless you have checked the box immediately below these certifications, you are not subject to backup withholding because
    * 		you are exempt from backup withholding, or
    * 		you have not been notified by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that you are subject to backup withholding as a result of failure to report all interest or dividends; or
    * 		the IRS has notified you that you are no longer subject to backup withholding.
3. I am a U.S. citizen or other U.S. person as defined in the IRS Form W-9 instructions; and
4. The FATCA code(s) you have provided (if any) indicating that I am exempt from FATCA reporting is correct.

You must check this box if you have been notified by the IRS that you are currently subject to backup withholding because you have failed to report all interest and dividends on your tax return.

I’m 23 and still very new to this and don’t understand what this is saying. I’ve never been “contacted” by the irs or anything like that.

191,USA,"  **Want to Move from Crypto to Stocks. Where to Start?**   


 I started trading Forex for the first time 10+ years ago. It was more like playing and exploring, I never invested significant amounts in it.

Back in 2016 I built some computers for cryptocurrency mining, not because I was genuinely interested in crypto, but just because I wanted to spend some of my company's money and reduce taxes in that way. That's how I got involved with cryptocurrencies.

Since then I'm trying to trade cryptocurrencies but without much success. My problem is, I still consider cryptocurrencies a ponzi and can't be relaxed when ""invested"". Instead to hold I always panic sell when prices drop below my entry point and then don't re-buy lower. Each times prices drop I think this is the end, and the whole market will crash.

Now I want to try to invest in stocks, because I would feel much more relaxed if I invest in real companies. I would be able to hold for months and not to check prices every 5 minutes.

I never tried investing in stocks because:

\- I have no idea where I can buy stocks. What platform someone who's not from the USA and EU can use? Is there a good platform for international users?  
\- I don't know where to start and how to find my niche. There is so much stocks, but how to pick some?

I'm not looking for 50% profits overnight, I'm not into overhyped projects that are already too high. I'm interested in investing in companies/stocks that are in slight uptrend, without too much volatility. Something with possible steady, slow growth. I don't want to get rich quickly, just to invest my cash in something that's not very risky (such as crypto) and to watch it grow faster than inflation.

Any recommendations for me regarding trading platforms and stocks sectors?",blersion,1,/r/investing/comments/llr1yi/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gnr9npk/,0.095,0.806,0.099,-0.5433

For example, AAPL is around $2.2trillion, which is the worth of its NASDAQ shares, but what about its Frankfurt Stock Exchange shares? There its market cap is listed as 1,811.44 bn (frankfurt/euro currency) - is that a separate, additional amount of capital they own?  
  
Of course common sense tells me the $2.2trillion amount is the TOTAL worth but that doesn't explain how the other exchanges have their own separate shares and trading activity and stock prices.  
Unless the Market Cap listed on google (and everywhere else) automatically searches this company on every single stock exchange on the planet and adds them all together to display the $2.2t market cap?

For example, AAPL is around $2.2trillion, which is the worth of its NASDAQ shares, but what about its Frankfurt Stock Exchange shares? There its market cap is listed as 1,811.44 bn (frankfurt/euro currency) - is that a separate, additional amount of capital they own?  
  
Of course common sense tells me the $2.2trillion amount is the TOTAL worth but that doesn't explain how the other exchanges have their own separate shares and trading activity and stock prices.  
Unless the Market Cap listed on google (and everywhere else) automatically searches this company on every single stock exchange on the planet and adds them all together to display the $2.2t market cap?

Hi guys,

Been using Freetrade for a while, which has been great for learning the ropes, but you can't do anything like limiting orders unless you subscribe to freetrade plus - additionally they restrict some stocks to their plus members. 

Being in the UK , a lot of the penny stocks I want to invest in are US stocks and Freetrade, Etoro , Etc are pretty limited in their offerings here....

I like not having to pay fees / comission or membership. Anyone got any recommendations for apps  that are good for US stocks from UK?",jaf243,1,/r/investing/comments/llr1yi/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gnsekxa/,0.098,0.757,0.146,0.6677
222,USA," Reposting from yesterday because I posted super late in the morning. 

&#x200B;

Hi all-- made a throwaway so I can talk personal finances. Wanted advice on if arbitrary NW milestones allow flexibility in taking the saving foot off the gas a little. Just hit 80k NW and feel like after paying myself (investment accounts) I'm always strapped for cash for hobbies. I've been telling myself that when I hit 100k I can start to invest more into my hobbies. My biggest fear is lifestyle creep.

My main questions:

1. How did you determine how much you should set your savings rate to?
2. I know accumulating as much as possible as early as possible is the smartest thing to do, are there any reference materials to investment styles that are frontloaded and ease off?

For the bullet points above:

* 23m, USA
* Fulltime, 70k annual, tax+ investment = 80-85% savings rate
* FIRE
* Time horizon is 40 yrs+
* Breakdown is about 50% Index funds and 50% individual stocks/ options.
* Mostly VTSAX, SPACS and individual tech/ internet/ cloud stocks.
* Emergency Fund of 4k in HYSA +1k in checking always

Hope to get some insight, can't really talk about this stuff with people I know irl. Thanks!",throwaway12141312,1,/r/investing/comments/llr1yi/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gnskiyn/,0.041,0.849,0.11,0.929
223,SE," Good afternoon - my partner and I are looking to get started with investing. We are both mid-20s and in real estate. LCOL area. Above average income especially for our area multiple 6 figures. Less than $20k debt not counting mortgage.

We just bought a house as a primary residence and want to continue to buy real estate as our jobs provide various perks to doing so. My goal is over the next 10 years to acquire minimum $8,000/month of cash flowing rentals with net rental income getting reinvested into the principal - give or take 20 years from now all properties will be paid in full and will provide $100,000/year with rent increases to account for inflation.

Meanwhile - we want to be diversified in the stock market. I am W2, they are SE 1099 under an S-Corp. We get health insurance through me and have an HSA. I have a Roth IRA, 401k, and get company stock. Partner does not have any retirement accounts currently. As much as stock picking, crypto, etc. is really enticing, I would prefer to go for the low/medium risk/medium reward over anything else.

So my questions are: Should I continue to max out my HSA and other retirement accounts first, then start funding a brokerage account? This is my plan does this seem right?

1. Max out HSA
2. 401k company match amount
3. Max out Roth IRA
4. Max out SEP IRA or equivalent
5. 20% down on investment property
6. Max out 401k
7. Leftovers into brokerage account such as Wealthfront?",IAm_TheCaptainNow,1,/r/investing/comments/llr1yi/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gnslhws/,0.009,0.953,0.038,0.7582

# Looking for suggestions to preserve ETF gains from downward tangential influences

I'm a believer in the bullish future opportunities of green energy plays, but tire of downward momentum caused by a tangential super inflated equity with a cult like following.

A while back I exited this particular equity when its valuation hit a level multiple tiers above that of logical future valuations and similarly moved some of the profits into a green ETF that specifically did not hold that equity. Now that things are looking bearish for that equity I started paying a little more attention to the ETF I jumped into and noticed the patterns are almost moving as a single entity, but with differing magnitudes.

I don't want to buy puts against TSLA due to absolutely insane IV, and will not risk shorting it and opening myself up to infinite losses, but I could buy some protective Puts against my own holdings or I could sell them and wait for TLSA volatility to calm down... maybe...

239,UK," An [oft-cited Vanguard study](http://www.smartretirement.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/7.23.2012_Dollar-cost_Averaging.pdf) found that on average, across various countries (US, UK, and Australia) and time periods (1926-2011 in US, 1976-2011 in UK, 1985-2011 in AUS) lump-sum investing a block of cash saw better returns than dollar-cost averaging it in over the course of a year (in a particular portfolio: 60% local stocks, 40% local bonds) about 2/3rds of the time. Thus, on the assumption that we retail investors can't time the market (so any attempt to guess at ""But THIS time we're in the 33% bucket!"" is a fools' errand), I generally just play the numbers: lump-sum does better than DCA 2/3 times, so invest my investable dollars as soon as I get them. 

On the other hand, that same study only saw lump-sum beating DCA by an average of around 2% (2.3% for US, 2.2% UK, 1.3% AUS) after 10 years. That particular 2% number is specific to all the variables of that study (the country, the time period, and the portfolio), but demonstrates a basic qualitative point: although lump-sum seems to historically beat DCA, it's not by a *huge* margin. So, if you think you'll see a psychological benefit from DCA'ing, that may be worth an anticipated couple percent underperformance.",throwawayinvestacct,5,/r/investing/comments/llr1yi/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gns1b5g/,0.029,0.896,0.075,0.8147

244,EDIT," First, $6k a month? As in $72k a year???

Second, whether that amount or something less, why are you putting it all in a taxable account if you intend to hold for 30-40 years? At the very least, I'd do a Roth IRA, and see if there are any other tax-advantaged accounts available to you (401k? HSA?)

Third, I think you're getting overly complex for the sake of it. SPLG is an S&P500 index fund. QQQ is a Nasdaq index fund. SCHG is a large-cap US fund (with a growth tilt). And VTI is a US total market account. There is *huge* overlap between these funds: owning VTI will already get you invested in everything owned in SPLG, QQQ, and SCG. That means that owning those other funds alongside VTI doesn't *diversify* you, it *concentrates* you in whatever companies they overlap on. For example, here are their top 6 holdings:

* VTI: Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook, Tesla, Google (two share classes)

* SCHG: Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook, Google (two share classes), Tesla

* SPLG: Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook, Google (two share classes), Tesla

* QQQ: Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Tesla, one Google share class, Facebook (and then the other Google share class is 7th)

In fact, FTEC is a US-only IT sector fund made up of almost only large-cap companies which means, again, its holdings are largely (honestly, it might be entirely, but I don't know for sure) overlapping with VTI again. It's largest holdings? Apple, Microsoft, NVIDIA, Visa, Paypal, Mastercard. Treating the two Google share classes as one, Visa is VTI's 10th biggest holding, NVIDIA is it's 13th, and Mastercard is it's 16th.

There's nothing *wrong* with holding overlapping funds if that's what you intend to do for some reason (e.g., maybe you want to own the whole US market but make an outsized bet on tech, so you own VTI plus some FTEC on top of it), but that's not what this looks like. Basically, you have a bunch of broad US index funds (leaning a bit towards larger-cap and growth-style companies) and then IXUS (a good international index fund). 

I would add bonds and maybe up the international exposure a bit, but (as a start) I think 80% VTI, 20% IXUS (or VXUS if you wanted to have matching Vanguard funds) would make more sense than this.

EDIT - I see in your note that you recognize the ""overlap in tech"" but again, I think it's overly complex for no real reason. As I alluded to (lucky guess!) if you wanted broad US with some tech focus, VTI+something like FTEC might make more sense.",throwawayinvestacct,1,/r/investing/comments/llr1yi/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gnsllvx/,0.007,0.914,0.079,0.9685

* SCHG: Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook, Google (two share classes), Tesla

* SPLG: Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook, Google (two share classes), Tesla

* QQQ: Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Tesla, one Google share class, Facebook (and then the other Google share class is 7th)

In fact, FTEC is a US-only IT sector fund made up of almost only large-cap companies which means, again, its holdings are largely (honestly, it might be entirely, but I don't know for sure) overlapping with VTI again. It's largest holdings? Apple, Microsoft, NVIDIA, Visa, Paypal, Mastercard. Treating the two Google share classes as one, Visa is VTI's 10th biggest holding, NVIDIA is it's 13th, and Mastercard is it's 16th.

There's nothing *wrong* with holding overlapping funds if that's what you intend to do for some reason (e.g., maybe you want to own the whole US market but make an outsized bet on tech, so you own VTI plus some FTEC on top of it), but that's not what this looks like. Basically, you have a bunch of broad US index funds (leaning a bit towards larger-cap and growth-style companies) and then IXUS (a good international index fund). 

I would add bonds and maybe up the international exposure a bit, but (as a start) I think 80% VTI, 20% IXUS (or VXUS if you wanted to have matching Vanguard funds) would make more sense than this.

EDIT - I see in your note that you recognize the ""overlap in tech"" but again, I think it's overly complex for no real reason. As I alluded to (lucky guess!) if you wanted broad US with some tech focus, VTI+something like FTEC might make more sense.",throwawayinvestacct,1,/r/investing/comments/llr1yi/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gnsllvx/,0.007,0.914,0.079,0.9685

Your question, should fit the bill of this sub because of the responses like this.  

1st., the psychology or risk wanting to short high flying stocks is a fools errand majority of the time. 
	a) access to real-time short interests, margin calls and short covering - all data and actions that increase 	buying demand to squeeze you out and force you to cover your short. Real-time short interest for example, a lot 	of false data vendors say they have it - I’ve only come across S7 Partners Black App, only on Big money 	platforms.

Open up a ThinkorSwim Charles Schwab account, best interoperable 		platform and 1st use their paper trading feature for all your strategies.

2nd., long term has always been the way to go and won’t have you fully occupied on the markets.  I don’t trade at work. I set my orders and stops, very rarely at my office. What has worked for me over the years is less diversification but picking stocks that I love, weighted heaving on non speculation vs. speculation.  A few examples:

PANW (Non-Spec): One of my oldest holdings.  Cover of the WSJ journal wouldn’t stop reporting on new cyber breaches and wall street at the time didn’t apply the premium for cyber security stocks. I simply asked my brilliant CTO at the time, “ if you could fortify our infrastructure what would be best company.” He immediately replied, “ Palo Alto.” Next day I listened to the prior earnings release , read up on the executive and top programmers bios, bought and never looked back.  Heaving weighting at the time 40%, partially unwound now its 20%. 
*never go broke taking a profit and I never had any stress with this trade, nor did it occupy much if any of my time after I went long

NVTA (Non-Spec): mega trend of genome therapy should be $100 in 12 months, brilliant team and no real elite competition.  Similar set up , under the radar sub-sector, but required some patience in the beginning and more due diligence. Not cut and dry like PANW, sector may be biotech but it’s not a tradition biotech company needed to run competition analysis at the subsector. Huge weight in my portfolio 

PACB (non-spec): similar thesis as the top two only biotech company in my portfolio. A lot of analysis into their pipeline and execs.  I was luckily, however, on how quickly it got to $50, I partially unwound over 50% of my accumulated shares.

289,GME," Great reply thank you.

I'm with you on the philosophy that once everyone starts talking about it then maybe that's the time to be getting out, not in. I may be purely paranoid about this but I've always had this sneaking suspicion that an investment will only become publicly recognised and hyped about when the big institutions want you to know about it. In other words once they've made their plays and want the common folk to drop in all their money. Then they cream off the profit at our expense. Especially with Bitcoin now, I'm highly suspicious of just how many articles are hyping it. Something stinks to me.

I was also burned once before in a bubble on the back of hype and I'm very reluctant to risk going down that route again. There were so many voices saying, ""Buy buy buy. There's no way this can go down. Look at its obvious potential."" Yet down it went all the same. Down to nothing. We saw the same just recently with GME. I tried to warn folk then but the bulls drowned everyone out and I was even insulted for suggesting it might go down. I don't trust hype any more and I trust something even less when hype is the only voice.

Another concern I didn't raise is I suspect there's a very real prospect of governments putting blocks on crypto mining. With it causing such huge energy usage and with increasing concern about the environment, this could be a stumbling block for Bitcoin down the road. It could be argued blocking mining would increase Bitcoin's value but I don't believe government intervention ever really helps grow value as the fear of any kind of government intervention scares investors away.

Regarding the comment on companies doing badly, may depend where you are. Many companies in the UK have done badly but not sure how things are in the US if that's where you are. Maybe there wasn't as much stringent lock down there as here. A number of companies have gone under here, many physical shops are suffering. Travel companies are struggling. Restaurant industry is in shock. Many companies on the FTSE are still down around 15% or more on their pre-Covid days. Where as the Dow is higher than during the Covid crash. I imagine a number of sectors in Europe are down on where they would have been without Covid. But who knows.

Interesting comments regarding Bitcoin and especially around the wider discussion as to its growth and what that would mean, as well as the fragmentation situation. It does feel somewhat like we're in a limbo state similar to the example you give of pre civil war currency. Governments haven't yet stepped in to determine its fate or put in place specific laws which could hugely influence its future.

Ultimately though could Bitcoin ever be big enough to act as a currency to overtake the dollar? As far as I understand there's a limited number of bitcoins that can be mined. And of that, it also has a very slow transaction time compared to currencies today. Kind of seems fundamentally flawed and I can't imagine governments would be keen to take on a currency they can't control, printing their own money as they need it.",kemb0,1,/r/investing/comments/llr1yi/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gnral3d/,0.15,0.759,0.091,-0.9923

291,GDP," I think you misunderstood my point or I didn't make it clearly. I was suggesting many stocks are under performing due to Covid which is why Bitcoin is doing well, because it's not seen as a risk of going bankrupt. Not the opposite. But having discussed this with another commenter it seems that's not so true in the US as it is in the UK. The US stock market has pretty much recovered whilst the UK is still down from a pre-covid high of 7,700 to currently around 6,700. So I'm seeing this from my local perspective. 

However presumably it's still true that there's a limited supply of capital in the world to buy in to Bitcoin. If Bitcoin went from $50,000 to $500,000 we're talking about a growth equivalent to half the GDP of the US. That kind of growth has to be funded from somewhere or it's unachievable. I'm not convinced that the traders who are moving the big money are willing to shift that level of equity in to Bitcoin any time soon and even if that did begin to happen it'd have a knock on effect causing share prices to drop (as presumably that's where the institutional traders would take their money from), which would then make stock prices more attractive at their lower price, thus causing Bitcoin to drop. Essentially supply and demand.

I guess yes I am trying to validate my opinion on this. Is that a bad thing? I want to validate whether my sentiments have merit or are misguided. Reason being it's very easy to validate a ""buy"" sentiment on the internet because everyone and their dog is championing bitcoin right now, but considerably harder to find people willing to consider the down sides. That could itself be indicative of future growth but in my experience that can also be indicative of a pending crash when hype overtakes reason.

You make some good points about faster transfers however my understanding is that equally Bitcoin can't handle instant transfers necessary for general consumer purchases. Any delay in payments can see a significant fluctuation in price with Bitcoin, where as currencies aren't going to see the kind of daily 10% price fluctuations Bitcoin often sees.

295,IMO," >Taxes on long term capital gains are actually pretty easy...

Then do it yourself. But you didn't indicate how many different batches you were talking about, crypto is a new beast tax-wise generally, etc. With those kind of numbers I just figured it might be worth the little bit to pay someone else. Tertiary point tho, up to you.

>Yeah - I'm not near retirement age, and I realize 500k isn't enough to retire quite yet

Yeah, I was just making that in response to your point about taking a long sabbatical from the 9-5 life. It's not enough to take a *permanent* sabbatical from it, so I personally would rather use it to set me up forever, rather than living off of it to take a long break away from work (or working part time) only to have to swing back into work after a few years.

>I'm not sure what you mean by ""go home""? Isn't this sub about investing, and ""all investing involves risk"". I just happen to be lopsided in Crypto lol

I meant it like [I'm gonna' take my ball and home](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=I%27m%20going%20to%20take%20my%20ball%20and%20go%20home%21). By ""go home"", I just meant ""go home"" from the casino of crypto (to me, crypto is far more of a gamble/casino than true investing) and into something more conservative that'll set you up for life. Still investing, sure, but like... In VTI or something dull like that.

Think about it: with a paid-for house and retirement nest egg that's probably sufficient (or nearly so) with virtually no further contributions, that makes whatever salary you *do* earn for the rest of your working life basically all yours to enjoy along the way. But you can do it with the knowledge that you have a stable base.

299,JG," ""Ultimately though could Bitcoin ever be big enough to act as a currency to overtake the dollar?""

I definitely don't think bitcoin would ever overtake the dollar or anything like that, it's more a question of whether bitcoin gaining the kind of mainstream demand that would take the price into $100K and beyond is symptomatic of people starting to slowly shift away from owning dollars and looking for ""something else"" assets, whether it be bitcoin or growth stocks that seem to go up every single day or other things. I don't think Weimar or anything like that by any means (although inflation is a growing concern of mine) and hopefully it never comes to that where the stock market becomes this (about Weimar, from ""When Money Dies"") https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Es192AjXIAUBzK8?format=jpg&name=large    

Or maybe this is just another layer of something of a bubble. But again, if Bitcoin starts hitting $100K and higher, I'd have to ponder whether whether that implies something broader about the economy that people (and companies) are willing to shift money into that asset class to that sort of extreme. If Bitcoin gets to $100K, FOMO buying is an aspect of that obviously, but what else would be the psychology/reasoning behind that if it happens?

But the fact that it seems that most markets are still bullish, despite a big drop last year from Covid, that I still stand by my original assessment.

>If Bitcoin went from $50,000 to $500,000 we're talking about a growth equivalent to half the GDP of the US.

I don't see the how you can speculate on that with any certainty especially as it compares to GDP. It also seems like your making the assumption that because the market cap would be at half the US GDP that it would take half the US GDP to get there, which isn't true. It's also not really insane for market caps to be that much in comparison to GDP(although the ratio is relatively high right now but that's another bag of worms), the combined market caps of the top 5 stocks on the NASDAQ also are *currently* equivalent to half of the US GDP. So to say that BTC might be at 50% of the 2020 US GDP in ten years after having 1000% gains in that time period, seems relatively feasible to me.

>I guess yes I am trying to validate my opinion on this. Is that a bad thing?

Yeah, because you should be doing the opposite, trying to disprove your opinion. Don't leave the *critical* out of critical thinking.

>Reason being it's very easy to validate a ""buy"" sentiment on the internet because everyone and their dog is championing bitcoin right now, but considerably harder to find people willing to consider the down sides. That could itself be indicative of future growth but in my experience that can also be indicative of a pending crash when hype overtakes reason.

In my experience, the bitcoin bears are the ones that literally just do not understand it from a fundamental/technological level, or they are Buffett-level value investors who stay away on principle.

>You make some good points about faster transfers however my understanding is that equally Bitcoin can't handle instant transfers necessary for general consumer purchases. Any delay in payments can see a significant fluctuation in price with Bitcoin, where as currencies aren't going to see the kind of daily 10% price fluctuations Bitcoin often sees.

Bitcoin will never be used for everyday transactions on the base layer, that's why developer are working on second layer solutions like Lightning Network, that can process payments faster and cheaper, or companies like MasterCard are offering custodial ways of letting you pay with bitcoin but not directly through the blockchain, sort of the same way you'd pay using fiat with a credit card, the money isn't actually moving although you're still using your BTC balance. There are other better suited cryptos for that type of thing too, where they actually have the speed and bandwidth needed to do that type of thing, even comparable to Visa/Amex/MC.

335,EH," Your answer makes it clear that you did not read the short report. Otherwise you would ""be able to verify"" the fabricating of the purchase order by re-tracing the SEC filings and come to your own conclusion.

With respect to the misrepresentation of the language; refer to this document \[1\] on page 26  which identifies the claim across US and canadian agencies.

Finally, your statement ""misrepresenting the quality of their products - doubt. they have already showcased this multiple times in multiple continents.""  with all due respect, is ludicrous.  The quality of their product is the MOAT, the edge, the reason ehang exists. It strikes at the core tenants for ehangs to thrive/dive. 

Ehang uses HOBBY GRADE OEM hardware used in drones. Uber REJECTED their partnership proposal on this basis. The director of aviation engineering and former NASA scientist publicly stated that these machines are not suitable for human beings. Ehang's only customer (their reseller) was recorded on the record saying that ""EHang’s battery technology is “not very good.”

338,ETH," 1. Low interest rates are one of the strongest coorelations with rising gold prices, most specifically real rates. We currently have a rising negative interest rate (inflation rising faster than interest rates). It is true low interest rates make stocks more attractive and bonds less attractive but gold also benefits from low rates. 

2. Bitcoin's price doesn't appear to be effecting gold prices. If you price gold at 1972 when we came off the gold standard to the rise in total money supply gold is currently at fair price.  The issue is most people have no idea how to accruately price gold. 

3. Tesla is discussing buying gold. Other companies also own gold as a hedge. Gold is currently owned by far more institutions than bitcoin. I personally own both btw along with ETH.",BJJblue34,2,/r/investing/comments/lm14c9/these_are_the_reasons_i_am_feeling_bearish_on_gold/gnslc3h/,0.075,0.775,0.15,0.8441
