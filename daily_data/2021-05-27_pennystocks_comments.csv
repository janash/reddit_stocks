31,IMO," The insight is different depending on the person/situation/things going on in your life. IMO the main thing is more an intensification of feelings that may be dulled in everyday life. 

For example, in my head I know that I should take good care of my body, or put more effort into relationships that I care about etc. but many of us let life's distractions get in the way. When these topics cross your mind on psychedelics, the feelings of wanting to improve these certain areas of your life (as well as most feelings) are amplified X1000. All the little excuses you use to rationalize not doing them disappear, and you know in your soul that you can and will do better and can't believe you were so indifferent about whatever it is previously.

For me its not usually that I'm confronted by some ground breaking revelation that I had never realized before (though this can happen as well), but more that it almost forces you to think about issues in your life with emotion/feeling/energy so intense that it tends to stick with you even after the trip is over. 

Sure, some people do everything great and don't need the kick that psychedelics can give you, but many in todays world are often numbing/excusing/procrastinating their problems away to some degree, and this intense burst of emotional energy can sort of snap you back to what is important.",giggity_ghoul,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/nm6gmp/easily_the_most_unique_potential_use_of/gznii5a/,0.049,0.798,0.153,0.9768

77,DD," Does appear that way. Not certain if it is pumpers trying to justify their late purchase or the parabolic increase that causes someone to take a look at fundamentals then post the DD. 
On the receiving end, we likely do not see it until it becomes a headline. A mental gloss over.
Finding the rough gem, prior to that 1600% increase is the rough part. I have one stock that I firmly believe will go parabolic at some point. I try not to pump it, because I want to see what they do naturally in the next 18 months. I've posted some DD but you probably haven't seen it out glossed over it because there is not a huge, current increase that makes you pay attention. Similar to a newspaper headline... Just my theory",divesaw,3,/r/pennystocks/comments/nlyida/the_lounge_thoughts_noob_stuff_low_effort_brokers/gzmy7fg/,0.042,0.902,0.057,0.2382
78,DD," I think all of your answers are right on it because everyone has their own reasons. Some people do it as a sort of ‚ÄúI told you so‚Äù which is useful for validating their analysis especially if they talked about it for a while. 

Others may do it to pump the stock or get on the hype and depending on their ‚ÄúDD‚Äù, I think most are lazy (a simple link to an article or a graph) or a clear copy/paste. I associate these users with how they respond to questions: they repeat the same thing, they recite the link (no added substance), or they backtrack and say do your own DD and I‚Äôm not a financial analyst defense. Not saying that isn‚Äôt valid, but we should all be honest and acknowledge that people on here do trust and rely in online DDs. So I‚Äôm of the opinion people who do them should take partial ownership.

Also, be wary when people start posting DDs or make comments on the daily plays thread and keep referring to themselves as jumping in before everyone else as soon as a stock spiked. Why? Because there‚Äôs a clear difference to me between someone who made a DD months ago versus someone else who made a DD right after a stock made gains. That second person may try to build credibility but it‚Äôs easier for them to say hey I was right when the catalyst was already there. I see this every week where like a week or two ago, someone claimed credit for their DD on ABML and people thanked them when ABML has been a play for months if not longer. I place more credibility in the user who made the ABML DD before instead of all of a sudden when the catalyst was already there like the whole uplisting news.",waitmyhonor,3,/r/pennystocks/comments/nlyida/the_lounge_thoughts_noob_stuff_low_effort_brokers/gzns2aq/,0.01,0.853,0.138,0.9911

87,DD,"  Many people buy penny stocks as swing buys or as day traders which means that if the is a strong rise, many will cash out to lock in their gains before you have a chance to save your own investment. While I have some pennies that I really believe are strong companies that will eventually make me good profits, the biggest mistake I made was holding after a stock had risen over 100% because I believed in it only to watch it tank. It's really hard not to chase things that are running or to believe in the excitement. A quick search of the stocks you mentioned shows many headlines full of hyperbole and I have to say the one about not caring about the lawsuit or the shorts should have at least raised an eyebrow.

88,OR," That is not a bad approach.  The only issue is you have to make sure there is a REASON it fell that is not a systemic problem in the stock/ company itself.  IF a company goes downhill it is usually for a reason so you have to make sure that reason is a one off.  For example, stock goes down because they didn't file their 10q on time.  Is that because they are just incompetent and when they finally do the stock goes back up OR are they stealing all the money from the piggy bank and about to make a getaway.  Hard to figure out on OTC markets since there are not enough professional eyes watching (analysts, professinal money, etc...).",10xwannabe,2,/r/pennystocks/comments/nmgwj9/penny_stock_fails/gzolzd3/,0.085,0.838,0.077,-0.2607
