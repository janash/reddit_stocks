0,VERB," Damn, and I was pretty happy when my trailing stop got me out at $7.35 at open yesterday.  


Enjoy, hope it stays up long enough for people to get out in the morning.  Let's hope VERB is next, lol.",phate_exe,19,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/osvw4b/sprt_making_moves/h6ra26z/,0.091,0.56,0.349,0.93
1,ANY," I remember when some guy commented in my DD post on this stock saying it was overvalued as is and a terrible trade ðŸ˜‚ that was below $4 iirc LOL
Congrats to all the longs, $8-$10 was my realistic price target, anything above current prices is icing in the cake. I should've made a post about ANY too which is another green miner q3 merger but I'm too lazy.
Look at the charts and trade the ranges & momentum people, these stocks will be ATM machines up until merger which isn't even announced yet.",ZenLeTomson,15,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/osvw4b/sprt_making_moves/h6rbpqb/,0.057,0.896,0.048,-0.2104

9,AMC, Iâ€™m not using a stop loss on SPRT because itâ€™s making some serious swings. I guess being in AMC and earlier in GME taught me to hold longer through the swings. Iâ€™m holding SPRT for a realistic price target of the previous high around $19.

14,RH," For in the money option contracts, You can sell the contract, if you donâ€™t and donâ€™t have the money in your account to exercise, RH will do so automatically one hour before the expiry of the contract. 
You will make exactly the same money as you would have by exercising and then selling the stock. 
This is something you donâ€™t need to worry about. 
Only scenario where I would choose to exercise is if I have money and I expect the stock to go substantially higher.",DoucheButStillOK,2,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/ota1j4/what_happens_if_you_buy_a_call_option_pay_the/h6v47u3/,0.034,0.966,0.0,-0.4404
