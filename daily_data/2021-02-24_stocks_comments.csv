2,CEO, Do any of you people know any smart people that are very religious? Is this just a Midwest thing? Because I’ve met many in the business world. At the old company I worked the CEO would literally talk about how he felt what he was doing was is his purpose in life.  What God wanted him to do. He didn’t make silly Business decisions because of that.

3,TSLA," ARKK was trading at 80$ back then after strong gains from the start of 2020, it then went on to nearly double to 160$ very recently before the tech sell off.

Cathie and her team are very open and share their thought processes and decision making through all of it so you could see if there was any thing you disagreed on at any point and put your money elsewhere, ARK etf's have done extremely well and the only bad thing people have said is its higher risk and somewhat speculative

Every religious person following their true passion (finance in this case) says they are fulfilling their purpose in life. Its a meaningless statement and everyone would call it bigoted if she were muslim and that was a reason to discredit all her success

Also this is just a hit piece by Cathie and TSLA haters and fuk bears trying to capitalize on the tech drop, in a month she will be back at ATH's outperforming everyone.",Scullyx,12,/r/stocks/comments/lqu1gs/cathie_wood_reveals_starting_ark_was_fulfilling/gokdun7/,0.086,0.8,0.114,0.6204

Palantir is doing government to manufacturing to law firms to finance, and I strongly believe over time it will make its way into the healthcare field with hospital logistics (my background is healthcare, and can see a very clear role for Palantir in hospitals). Plain and simple: Their product saves companies money while increasing productivity, and no one else does what they do.

So yes, I believe based on past performance Palantir is around what it should be, BUT I believe their growth will be exponential. The exposure they've been getting is incredible, and I believe more and more companies and industries will adopt their product.

I also believe NOW is the best time to buy in (or at least start building your position), because the speculative nature of the market right now will likely keep the price in the $25-35 range until the fundamentals catch up.",bearpics16,3,/r/stocks/comments/lrd6uz/pltr_a_word_of_caution/gollr7o/,0.008,0.872,0.12,0.9598

Palantir is probably 500th place on the list of overpriced stocks, and I think you'll bitterly regret so much caution on re-entry, subsequently entering at even worse prices.

What you are doing is market timing, and attempting to catch a falling knife under the guise of some very primitive technical analysis.

I am going to read through this entire thread later tonight, but the thing I think you're missing is the 30% YOY guidance for the next 5 years. That is a huge number, and I can even bet they intend on beating that quite substantially. Why do I say that? 30% YOY growth is a lot of growth, and a company who is bullish on themselves wouldn't cast out such a long sighted guidance like that, unless they were almost positive they would beat it. Especially in this current climate. They risk way more being over-zealous than over-cautious.

To get a good idea of how sticky their program is, that will take at least a couple of years.

But I want to mention as a side note that I believe the sky high valuations of new/unproven companies is because the bond and treasury yields are so low.

145,CC," Wheeling is alternating cash secured puts and covered calls on an underlying you don't mind holding. If you don't have the stock, you sell puts at a strike you don't mind paying. If you get assigned on your put, you sell a covered call on the shares at a strike slightly above the put that got assigned so you make the difference, then you go back to selling puts. You could do the same thing just with covered calls on the shares you want to hold (sell cc, and then sell puts if assigned to get your shares back), but I don't think it's as lucrative or as flexible as selling weekly puts.  

I bought 100 PLTR at $28.08 and I'm selling $30 covered call weeklies, and I move the strike higher if I think the stock will perform better than that. There appears to be a lot of resistance around $30, so I'm comfortable leaving it there for now. If I get assigned I'll just sell puts to get it back, or I may buy back the call and take the loss. Depends on how the math works out at the time.

One thing to note is that I think a lot of folks get a little greedy when they see that ""free"" CC money roll in and will sell riskier ones that return better. You have to remember that holding is often better because of the infinite upside, and that even a small amount of CC revenue can be significant.

158,PLTR," I think ""time in the market beats timing the market"" applies more broadly to the the market (e.g., indexes and ETFs). For single companies, you absolutely should evaluate whatever data you can get your hands on.  For a long term play like PLTR the big bet is one where it will be in 5-10 years and not necessary 1-2 years. So in that regard it doesn't matter quite so much if you get in at 25 or 20, aside from the fact that you can just buy a lot more when the share price is down for the same dollars. If you're doing a truly long term play, you're looking to maximize # of owned shares more than anything because you're banking on a lot of growth.

194,PLTR," Selling a put means you are writing the contract - in this scenario selling a $25 put means you are obligating yourself to buy PLTR at $25 x 100 shares so you will need to cash cover aka collateral $2,500 to your broker (I won't explain margin to make sure you understand I am not suggesting using margin).

You collect a premium say $100 to write this put. If PLTR hits $25 at expiry you are obligated to buy it at $25 plus collect $100 so your cost basis is $2400 meaning you essentially have 100 shares of PLTR at $24/share. If you were planning to buy PLTR at $25 anyways you technically come out ahead in this scenario if you had no other plans for that $2,500 of capital.

IF PLTR does not hit $25 at expiry then you just collect the $100 because the put you wrote expired worthless for the buyer aka you have no obligation to buy the shares but you keep the premium.

195,PLTR," Not buying on margin makes sense. Basically, you'd have to pay interest on whatever you're borrowing, right?

Thank you for the excellent explanation. Out of curiosity, what's stopping me from, say, writing a contract to buy PLTR at $30 at the end of the day, knowing full well that it won't exceed $25, and then collecting an easy $100 premium at the end of the day? Assuming that my goal isn't to actually buy PLTR shares.

Is it better then to just sell puts, write the contract for a price lower (or around) the price I'd be willing to pay, and still get the premium (and possibly lower-priced shares) instead of simply purchasing shares when their value dips?

197,PLTR," Buying on margin could mean that your other positions get liquidated in the event that your loss exceeds your available cash.

You may have interpreted the sentiment backwards. Selling a put is bullish, if you write a $30 contract and it's at $26 right now, you will get assigned to buy your $30/share minus premium. You would only collect that premium without being assigned if PLTR jumps from $26 to $30+ by expiry.

Yes in many cases if you are waiting for a dip to buy something and you don't think it'll run yet at it's current price then you could just sell puts for what you'd like to buy it at. If you collect premium for months and never get assigned, there is no catch BUT there is the fact that the stock could also run while you have no position.

It's not big money vs holding a stock and it climbs up strong. You would though come out ahead if you get assigned at the bottom then it climbs up lol! The theta value that people lose by holding calls or puts when a stock doesn't go up/down significantly is basically the money that you're collecting, if explained in an oversimplified way and disregarding the other greeks and stonks variables.",Kerune403,1,/r/stocks/comments/lr61pe/just_to_feel_the_pulse_who_is_still_strong_on_pltr/gomjgmv/,0.053,0.879,0.068,0.636
198,PLTR," >writing a contract to buy PLTR at $30 at the end of the day, knowing full well that it won't exceed $25, and then collecting an easy $100 premium at the end of the day?

That's basically the entire point of writing covered calls and cash secured puts - with covered calls for example, you own 100 shares of the underlying and can write a call option against those at a price you would be happy selling at. Let's say you bought 100 PLTR at $25, and you wouldn't mind selling at $33 - rather than just sitting and holding the shares, you can write a covered call at $33 strike to collect premium. If the stock price doesn't reach the strike price by expiration, you keep the premium. If it does reach strike you might get assigned, but since the call you sold had a strike well above your cost basis, you still make a $800 profit ($33-$25 x 100 shares) on the sale, in addition to your premium.

Let's say PLTR reached $30 in our scenario and the call you sold expired worthless - now you can write a new covered call at a higher strike and collect even more premium. You can do this over and over for every batch of 100 shares you own, until you either get assigned or decide to sell your shares.

>Is it better then to just sell puts, write the contract for a price lower (or around) the price I'd be willing to pay, and still get the premium (and possibly lower-priced shares) instead of simply purchasing shares when their value dips?

Either way has advantages and disadvantages. If the stock price doesn't fall below the strike on your put then you won't get assigned and won't end up owning the shares. But being able to collect guaranteed premium in the meantime is definitely an upside and lets you make some money while waiting for a dip.

Forgot to add - you may also end up paying a slightly (or significantly, with very volatile stocks/big dips, but you also get more premium with higher volatility stocks) higher price than whatever the stock ended up dipping to. Some or all of that difference may be covered by the premium you collected, though. For example: let's say you wrote a cash secured put with a $25 strike for a $100 premium, and PLTR dropped to $24. You'll get assigned and pay $2500 for 100 shares with a market value of $2400, but since you collected $100 in premium as well, you actually come out breakeven. If instead PLTR dropped to $23 and you got assigned, then you lost $100... etc. Something to keep in mind when writing CSPs.",skinny_malone,1,/r/stocks/comments/lr61pe/just_to_feel_the_pulse_who_is_still_strong_on_pltr/gomks19/,0.06,0.823,0.116,0.9838
199,PLTR," Hey, the catch is that if PLTR dumps to $20 you'll end up owning the stock at $25 still and that $100 in premium would not offset that $500 gap. You are also tying in collateral let's say for 30 days. 

If you get assigned at break even, you essentially made no profit on that money for the whole 30 days.

Some of the more notable failures were their EV prototype ran out of range and got stranded on a road; suspension broke when hitting railroad tracks; chassis performance problems; extensive door failures; safety belt failures; motor failures; ran out of power on multiple occasions; and the parking brake failure that injured a USPS employee was one of the last straws.
Workhorse destroyed the USPS relationship further once the USPS realized they were being consistently misinformed. Workhorse also occasionally misinformed their partner VT Hackney.
Workhorse was unable to handle all the work as a subcontractor, leading to poor quality products that missed deadlines. This resulted in VT Hackney needing to hire an additional subcontractor to help, Prefix.
Workhorse does not have the ability, machinery, or engineering talent to fulfill the USPS contract even if they somehow won.

276,EV," “Everyone charges at home” my guy some advise, you seem to be ignorant to this EV thing and are very married to your thoughts. 

Yes consumers charge their cars at home. This also has an upfront cost as you need a charging station installed in your house garage etc.  $$$. 
Battery life deteriorates every charge it’s best to run close to empty 15% prior to charging. This often happens at work or in town for people. It’s important to have charging stations everywhere for the consumer prior to EV taking off. 

Next step (consumer) country infrastructure when driving xcountry or small vacations you want to be able to charge along the way ( hotels, state parks, ski resorts, beech’s etc.) in order to build this infrastructure for this new market old market energy (oil)will slowly cut jobs. Given America’s current financial state lobbies don’t want to spend a bunch of money on growth when it means firing more than hiring. 

Now to commercial. 
To build an EV fleet contracts need to be drafted on not only the charging stations, the new mechanics, weather plays a part in EV vehicles, I don’t know route distances but to drive 8 hrs a day with the weight of mail and only getting to charge @ night as some suggest or at home as you say doesn’t give the truck the distance it had in gas so the companies got to look at more vehicles, more employees which means more costs.

495,RCL," Maybe, but on the other hand the cruises they are cancelling are already booked and it would be a pain to make a vaccine a requirement if it wasn't already widely available.  This would mean forced cancellations for a decent percentage of the bookings that would require last minute replacements or sailing at a much reduced capacity which may not even be profitable due to the fixed costs of most cruises.  You say  that a large portion of the demographic that takes cruises is over 65 and that is true but that is for the overall industry and not certain brands.  The main brands (such as Carnival) that are attached to these stocks all skew younger than the other more niche brands (many still owned by the same companies).  

Also none of the majors have announced a vaccine requirement as they fear the push back from the we don't want the vaccine crowd.  They could be waiting for herd immunity from the vaccines which is assumed at around 70% vaccinated.

I own RCL myself and I would rather have them wait and be successful than have some sort of botched early rollout and the resulting PR nightmare.  Future bookings are very strong and prices for 2022 are high.  They don't want to risk that just to get in a couple of extra sailings now.

Mostly because the Cars have way more differences than ICE and mostly because profiting out of maintenance like old school companies did isn't a great option in the future because those Cars are 3/4x cheaper to do maintenance.

I'm expecting an ignorant answer like ""yeah but those savings go away when you replace the battery"".

Do some research before saying things like your post.

Also, just for disclaimer, I don't think EV is the market to buy right now. It was 10 months ago, now the downside is the same as the upside and there are better markets to be in",paladino777,0,/r/stocks/comments/lrd5il/f_in_the_chat/gomp5ad/,0.053,0.844,0.103,0.7814

572,UK," Also consider the events industry as a whole. I work in events, including some weddings, and it's going to be absolutely booming after the pandemic is over. My clients are already looking ahead with bookings later in the year. The demand hasn't gone away at all, the clients are all still there, itching to hold events again.

I have a position in Hyve Group (ticker HYVE on the LSE). UK company that manages large events across the world. Before the pandemic they were trading at 700p - 1000p. Currently trades at 144p with a +24% in the last 3 months. Was well managed through the pandemic, was able to generate some cash through cancellation fees and insurance payouts. Currently undervalued big time.

Events won't be going away, the customer is 100% still there, ready to put money into their next event ASAP.

634,EV," Exro Technologies (EXROF). Patented technology with huge moat that has an enormous total addressable market in the EV sector. Essentially they  increase the power and efficiency of electric motors through their tech,  eliminating the need for a second motor (and gearbox), which is the current solution implemented by most EV companies. It's pretty cheap right now (currently consolidating nicely) but I'm very bullish on this company. Good management, good tech and in a hot growth sector.

Here is a quick 2 min video on the company if you're interested -  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwUo5SHYLPs&t=15s&ab\_channel=Exro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwUo5SHYLPs&t=15s&ab_channel=Exro)",Chill_Penguin,1,/r/stocks/comments/lr1vhx/what_are_some_good_23_year_hold_picks_of_yours/gojvr1z/,0.0,0.764,0.236,0.9675

665,OR," Just want to warn: Direct listings are like market open -- expect crazy immediate volatility, and therefore you can wind up either over OR under-paying for the security. You can find stories from people who either got a bargain this way or wound up buying in at a price it didn't hit again for *years* (or *ever* in some cases).    

If you're looking at this as an *investment* and actually believe in the company, you may be better off waiting a day to let the price settle. You may miss out on a bargain, but you'll also miss out on potentially overpaying too. Essentially it is leaving theoretical profit on the table in exchange for avoiding theoretical loss.

671,DD," I've seen too many of these posts in the last few months and that's understandable considering the amazing gains we've seen this time last year.

I'm going through this in a way myself right now so here's what's working for me:

1. Figure out if you're a trader or an investor. I'm an investor, so time>timing with a little DD sprinkled in for good measure. If you're a trader, then you need to look into paper trading, and then investing anywhere from 10 months to 2 years to find and master a trading and risk management framework that will net you positive gains in the long run (as opposed to the 90% that try and fail).
2. Less on the trading side, but more on the emotional side, be honest with yourself. Are you doing this because of all the gain porn you've been seeing on other subs? Those guys put themselves in the position to buy the rumors and sell on the news. The chances you'll find something similar and be ahead of the curve far enough in advance to make a big bang, without some fundamental knowledge in how to formulate, research and commit to investment ideas, you're basically gambling your money away on media fueled hunches. You won't get rich chasing action, not at this stage anyway. You need to have your finger on the pulse of the macro and micro economic picture then drill down to stocks you can commit to.
3. On the FA side...not a FA, but there are some common sense things you can do...make sure you're debt free or on a path towards that, make sure you have cash reserves you can live on when the market goes tits up or heaven forbid you lose a job. I can't stress how critical this part is because if you're playing with money you can not lose, that immediately puts you in an unsustainable emotional framework, and you absolutely can not ever be in a position where your emotions drive your trading or investment decisions. The way you get there is to be financially stable.
4. If you want your money working in the market today - consider investing with an ETF...you'll do much better than the .05% most banks are offering for savings accounts :D

I get the FOMO effect, and sure, you could jump in today on that hot stock and maybe be looking at a $200 gain this time next year, but I guarantee you that you will be in a much better position emotionally if you take the time to pick and learn your trading/investment style, use paper trading to scratch that trading itch now, then slowly build your war chest for when you're ready to do it for real.

Hope that helps some...and good luck.",Mochaboys,2,/r/stocks/comments/lrbwks/what_can_someone_do_with_just_1000_without/gokz4b8/,0.05,0.766,0.185,0.9968
672,ALL," It is absolutely doable to start with $1000, I did it, but to answer #2 you've got to answer these questions: 

1. How badly do you need the money?  
 - Do you need it for day to day expenses, monthly expenses, do you need it in a few years (put down a deposit for a car or house), do you need it to retire on?  Or are you willing to lose it ALL and not blink with emotions?
- How much risk can you stomach?

 - Do you need it for day to day expenses, monthly expenses, do you need it in a few years (put down a deposit for a car or house), do you need it to retire on?  Or are you willing to lose it ALL and not blink with emotions?
- How much risk can you stomach?

So regarding my Q? #1, beyond answering it for you personally, understand the 4 buckets [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lqzrk7/a_note_to_new_investors_a_series_of_tutorials/) explains. Understand that investments are vehicles to take you to financial goals and different types of investment vehicles have different advantages & risks.  Like driving a golf cart to a minivan to a motorcycle.  You can certainly pick up [a motorcycle and fly real quick](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/lo84qt/in_6_months_i_turned_564_into_29099_trading/)... [or you can lose it all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUe-Hx3iQPI).

My small personal story: I started with a bank account, in college i put a $1k into a trading account to be my ""play money"",  but didn't actually play, just put a $1k into google and forgot about the account (lol), got a job after college, got a 401k & Roth IRA and contributed to it to the max. Got a bonus, bought a rental property, managed the rental for 10yrs, sold and bought a house to raise a family in... meme stocks reminded me that I had that 1k in that ""play"" account, so i logged back in to find it more than doubled. I got burned a little on GME & AMC (lost $300), but got the itch to play, went to pennystocks sub, like a fool invested into a DD recommendation and 3x'd $ in 2 days.  Sold out a portion to cover the initial investment, diversified and now into 10 positions,  stocks TANKED hard.  That one position that 3x'd lost 70%, all my other positions are mostly red.  Am currently back to where i was before the Memestocks... Shrug.  I don't need the money... and I HIGHLY recommend you don't play ""day or swing"" trader with anything you need anytime soon.

With rising interest rates, you need to decide does that fuel the housing market or slow it down.  ROBO is also just off an all time high a week ago.

Hopefully said company grows more than 10% ROI a year. Otherwise just buy the s&p index

Too far is subjective large market cap companies could grow slowly but typically are more safe and have solid growth. Look at $KO. 

ATH typically make new support after an eventual breakout.

Interactive pulled the same crap so they were instantly eliminated. (Although I do give their greedy as fuck CEO a lot of credit for admitting on the first day on national TV that it was all about protecting their money and the retail investor can fuck right off)

No.  You’d literally have to create more money for people to get paid or you’d have deflation because more people more products more services etc same amount of dollars.  Fed does not change populations they change rates.  Fed changes rates down in 2008 but people stopped buying houses anyways we saw deflationary pressure, things only recovered after people started buying houses again not low rates.  Banks limit lending in tough times to avoid bad exposure.  Low rates encourage but dont give you a job and money to buy a house.  It the psychology of human saving/spending, lending, population, are what drive inflation and rates are just something the Fed changes but then banks barely listen to.  Banks chose rates based on the economy and exposure.  Often now they remove entire loan options under certain situations.

You will see deflationary pressure continue as folks save, boomers move to fixed incomes then die, low birthrates in states, less people moving to usa, dollar losing use as a holding globally, further automated production.

Yes, the idea of everything turning leaf has been flirted with for a while, but the transition was slow. Musk took the economies of scale approach, flipped it on its head, and ran with it. EV's are cheaper because he hasn't stopped, single-handedly decreasing the cost via R&D.

Here's a video that explains Tesla's economies of scale: [link](https://youtu.be/OEIy7timrRY)

I'm of the opposite opinion that Jobs was an ass designer. I think he did a good job with his products, but I know that man was a very ""his way or the high way"" kind of man. 

I am also under the opinion that there is widespread manipulation across both stock and crypto markets. I cannot say definitely that market manipulation is going on, but I'm speculating due to the volatility of BTC and ETH. It would not surprise me if it happens to be HF's who are liquidating their assets to protect themselves from the current market situation they put themselves in. 

However, here is a clip of Roubini saying there is manipulation in the crypto market: [link](https://youtu.be/IllImMvvOEo)

776,DD," What I meant by not resting on DD, is I don't know how to do DD by looking at balance sheets and other objective data, and trying to come up with what I think is a reasonable valuation for a company from that on its own. Getting a feel for the value of a company is something I don't think I will be able to do until I have more experience and until then, branching out into a sector I don't know in other ways means going in blind. In tech, while I might not know how to interpret financial reports particularly adeptly, I at least have a very good idea of the importance of new technical developments and the trends in way different things are used in the industry. 

I know your ""probably that's why"" was a bit biting, but do you really believe investing blindly for the sake of diversification is better than investing in something I know a fair bit about and follow closely? It's an honest question, not trying to be abrasive or anything.

As per your link, is that not just evidence that one needs to diversify within a sector? A lot of the companies that survived have gone up a massive amount since that crash, even if some died. It's not like the sector as a whole was destroyed, right? (Also were those companies well known, or relatively small risky investments at the time?

The rest can still be heavy in tech, I myself am pretty young and heavy in tech and so far it went well for me even after that correction now. You just got bad timing, does not mean you did the wrong thing. It has to do with how much you want to gain and how much you are willing to lose.

I suppose there's a risk spectrum between 100% in a fund and 100% in a single stock and not diversifying is towards the riskiest side. I think at the point I'm at financially right now, I'm ok with being there, but I really appreciate your comments and explanations because in the long-term I will hopefully be playing with a lot more money than I am now.

As per learning how to do proper DD rather than going off general knowledge of the sector, is there any way I can learn how to do that other than just getting better with experience over time?

793,MSFT," I wasn’t investing back then, but I was an adult even before the 99 crash and I’ve done some research.

There are major differentiating factors between those two and today, especially the housing market crash. The dotcom crash might look similar in one aspect: overvalued tech stocks. The thing is, those “companies” back then were a few guys in a garage talking about being the next AOL. Consumers had no clue how to differentiate or review them. The internet was in its infancy, so you had brokers shilling pure sentiment. There is a lot more regulation in place now, and a lot more information available to research. A lot of the major new entrants/“disrupters” in the industry are themselves heavily financed and operated by reputable leadership. 

That’s not to say that some won’t bust. I’m sure some of them will. There’s always the potential for a Theranos or WeWork. But they aren’t the majority of them. Most probably just won’t take off, and many of those will get acquired by one of the big dogs. Speaking of big dogs, those also didn’t really exist back then. Today you have giants like MSFT, Salesforce, Oracle, Google, Amazon, etc and they gobble up emerging tech companies. That ecosystem didn’t exist back then, either.

The housing market crash was different in many ways with the finance sector leading the crash. Today’s finance sector is sitting on double or more reserve cash than in 07, and they’re playing more conservatively with assets.",notherday11,3,/r/stocks/comments/lrde8v/bears_are_gathering_at_rthebigcrash_is_this_a/gol8qax/,0.078,0.873,0.049,-0.8643

If they would have waited 2 days, they would have made $1 billion instead.

AMC [raised](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/amc-entertainment-to-issue-444-million-shares-as-investors-opt-to-convert-600-million-of-convertible-debt-2021-01-28) an additional $600 million on January 28 by issuing 44 million new shares and that immediately went to their debt.

They have seriously [diluted](https://www.barrons.com/articles/amcs-stock-gain-diverges-from-the-reality-of-its-debt-level-analyst-says-51612198907) their shares by hundreds of millions of new shares just in the last 150 days, and still have $5.7 billion in debt.  Rent on some theaters has been deferred for a long time, and is going to come due soon.

I don't know the exact number, but right now they have only a small revenue stream and are spending hundreds of millions per month to stay afloat, burning through their cash reserves.

Assuming:

* COVID and the accompanying fear ends immediately (not likely)
* they get similar traffic to a decent $100 million [profit](https://investor.amctheatres.com/financial-performance/financial-highlights/default.aspx) year like in 2018 (not likely)
* they aren't hit with any forced minimum wage increases (tons of their employees are near-minimum-wage earners)
* sure people will want to get out and see some movies, but will they want to give up their new-found streaming services that they have become accustomed too?  (not likely)

Assuming all those are 100% in AMC's favor, then it will still take them 57 years to pay off their current debt, and that's assuming they have no down years like in 2017 when they lost $487 million instead of earning any money.  Let's say they have no down years and for some reason their growth is amazing.  That's still 3 decades of income just to pay off their debt.

I like going to a few movies a year but there is no way that I can see for our current atmosphere to boost their revenues to profitability.  They will need some new form of revenue or it will just be a long, slow decline to $1 once the current mania dies down.

2) the Ocean will be ready for market in late 2022, by then all the traditional car makers will be selling their own electric SUVs.

3) unlike Lucid, Fisker won’t have the in-house tech to distinguish itself. They’re planning to source the battery tech from Volkswagen. This is incredibly problematic: VW’s EV tech currently is pretty crap (look at the embarrassingly short ranges of the top end VW EVs vs the Tesla or Lucid).

You are not answering the question at all. Your poor reply is just filled with loosely explained economic concepts that are put together haphazardly.

These are the reasons:

**Cash flows from companies lose value:** A stock is valued as the discounted sum of its cash flows. There are two components to this concept. First, a sum of cash flows. For example, if the company is expected to generate ₹1 crore every year for the next 25 years and zero thereafter, the value of the stock would be ₹25 crore. However, ₹1 crore after three years is worth less than ₹1 crore today because of inflation. This is even more true of ₹1 crore after five years or ten years. Hence, equity analysts apply what is called a ‘discount rate’ to the cash flows, assigning lower values to cash flows that are further and further in the future. This discount rate is the risk-free interest rate in the economy. When the risk-free interest rate rises, the value assigned to cash flows drops. Rising bond yields imply a rise in the risk free rate and hence lower equity valuations.  


**Higher interest costs for companies**: A rise in bond yields denotes higher interest rates in the economy. Higher interest rates push up the cost of loans taken by companies and makes it harder for them to borrow additional money to invest. This ultimately affects their profits and hence the returns of shareholders. The stocks of companies with a large amount of debt are particularly impacted. The higher rates also affect consumers by pushing up costs on items such as home loan EMIs. This reduces the overall demand in the economy.  


You may find that the latter is not a good explanation for the current context as Fed has mentioned that they are continuing their accommodative monetary policy which means low interest rate for foreseable future. However, with the higher yield AT THE MOMENT, those companies that need to borrow NOW will need to borrow at a higher interest rate. Hence, companies will suffer a drop in their profits which result in investors to sell the stocks. 

Furthermore, as the yield is rising, investors may find that bond may be an attractive option now hence the equity sell-off.
