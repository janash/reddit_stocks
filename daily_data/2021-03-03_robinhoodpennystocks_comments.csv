0,CC," The going up part seems a bit weird to me. Having 100+ shares to sell a put doesn't make sense since it won't help me at all if I get assigned the 100 shares from the put I sold. It would be much better to have that cash in my account so this means I have a CSP or cash secured put.

if you look at  it that way you are showing us the CSP Version of trading options when selling puts (but with owing shares and that's weird) and the CC (covered call - I own the shares for the call and if I get ""called"" I am save because I have the shares) version trading options when selling calls.

CSP is new to you? This is how it works in some easy words:

1. Find a stock you like (due to whatever reasons) and you do not mind to own at least 100 shares of
2. Set a price you would like to buy the stock for (stay realistic for that). For this example let's say 20 USD per share seems fair for you.
3. Put 2000 USD into your account (100\*20 because 1 options is 100 shares) and sell the put to collect the premium (yes, you may subtract the premium from the cash you put into the account but make sure you have enough money to not be on margin because that is the reason for making a cash SECURED put and not a naked one)
4. wait and watch (yeah, you can do more than this but we keep it simple). If you get the shares assigned because stock does not go up but down and is worth less than 20 USD per share you get 100 shares for 20 USD and keep the premium. if not you keep the premium and can sell another new put (be sure to have the new one cash secured).

150,TXMD," For all those interested in TXMD operating expenses (maybe I'm the only one?) here's the scoop from their latest earnings report. They claim that they have ""lowered our operating expenses"" which seems to conflict with the information they provided below:

**Expense, EPS and Related Information**

‚Ä¢Total operating expenses for the full-year 2020 increased to $204.4 million compared with $194.5 million for full-year 2019.

‚Ä¢Total operating expenses for the second half of 2020 were $92.6 million, meeting the Company‚Äôs target of $80 million excluding non-cash items and performance-based retention incentives, which totaled $13 million.

‚Ä¢Total operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2020 increased by $10.6 million to $51.6 million as compared to $41.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2019.The increase in operating expenses was primarily a result of increased spending focused on delivering the necessary resources to support the launch of ANNOVERA, continued ramp-up of IMVEXXY, and ongoing brand management of BIJUVA.

‚Ä¢Net loss for the full-year 2020 was $183.5 million, or $0.67 per basic and diluted share, compared with $176.1 million, or $0.72 per basic and diluted share, for full-year 2019.",TheGallopingGhost77,1,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/lwhbms/daily_discussion_thread/gpjiolz/,0.031,0.844,0.125,0.9413

209,STC," Okay so few things.

1. Option contracts are 100 shares of the company. So you paid $0.07/ share x 100 shares x 2 contracts = $14 (your cost)

2. Since you paid $0.07/ share in options for a $4.50 strike on Mar 19, you need to add that to the price to break even ,$4.50 + $0.07 = $4.57

3. You need Nokia to move $0.56 in  15 days to break even. That‚Äôs a 14% rise in value. That‚Äôs a lot to move if ‚Äúno news‚Äù so the price is low.

4. Options are time dated instruments and have an expiry date. (shares in companies have no expiry). This means if the price doesn‚Äôt move and stays the same on the shares, the options lose value everyday just by doing nothing. The technical term is Theta and it is the amount of value the option will lose per day of no price change . Now theta moves all around because of price change but the important point to remember is it is always working against you as a buyer of options as it is always decreasing the options value.

5. Edit: since you are a ‚Äúbuyer‚Äù of the option contracts, your maximum loss is $14 (what you paid).

6. If in the next 15 days Nokia starts moving up in price, you can STC (sell to close) your position if the options go to $0.14 (100% return less commissions). Point is you can STC anytime.


***** IMPORTANT you only STC options what you have bought and still in your account. 

DONOT under any circumstances SELL options. You need more experience (no slight to you, we were all noobs at one point). 

Remember when you BUY options the max loss is what you paid. When you sell options, unless you have a strategy to limit your losses, the amount you can lose can be unlimited.",boreastudio,18,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/lx0lny/im_a_noob_with_options_please_dont_grill_me_i/gpk8kl3/,0.07,0.859,0.071,-0.3717
210,NOK," It‚Äôs not worth much because NOK is still below 4.50, AKA the option is still ‚Äúout of the money.‚Äù

As you get closer to the expiration date, the price changes of NOK will have a greater effect (will have more leverage) on your call contract price.",donkey_tits,1,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/lx0lny/im_a_noob_with_options_please_dont_grill_me_i/gpkjttq/,0.035,0.912,0.053,0.2105

212,NOK," You have a break even price of $4.57 (the $4.50 you're betting on plus the .07 you've already paid per share). So you really need ot to hit $4.57 to break even. 

This is all considering you actually want to buy the shares. You can also hope for the options contract price to go up and sell it back and make money that way.  

I havent been following NOK for quite some time, so I couldn't tell you what I think about the chances of that personally. But I can tell you that with March 19 only a couple of weeks away, your Theta (time decay) is probably higher than you want, which isn't good for you at the moment. Again, if you want to actually buy the shares, then the price of the options contract (and thus, time decay) probably doesn't matter much to you. 

I'm all for the way you're learning here. It's how I did it. But until you learn about exactly how much of this works, make sure you stay away from selling naked contracts (selling contracts you don't already own the shares for), because your theoretical losses are limitless and you could end up in trouble if you do that wrong. Buying calls like this has a fixed loss already built in. The most you can lose is $14. 

I also recommend that you make sure you learn about the greeks, as they are the mechanisms for how the option contract's price will move up and down.",platypusbelly,6,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/lx0lny/im_a_noob_with_options_please_dont_grill_me_i/gpka2gr/,0.065,0.842,0.093,0.5509
