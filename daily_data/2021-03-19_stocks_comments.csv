0,CAN," You should add, How to make money in stocks; A winning system in good times or bad by William J O’Neal. He’s had a few protégés win stock investing championships. 

The CAN SLIM method is great looking for growth. It gives you info how to simply read charts, find sector rotation , knowing when the market is in uptrend or down. Be disciplined and sell at a 5-7% loss.  It’s chock full stuff",cometburn4,11,/r/stocks/comments/m85sp6/list_of_books_to_read_if_you_want_to_actually/grg1pg4/,0.068,0.699,0.233,0.9349
1,SA," I would point out that for people who want to engage in value investing, if you find research, reading financial statements and annual reports and making spreadsheets and taking notes a boring chore, you might want to consider doing something else. 

Yes, it's a time-tested strategy, but why would you spend your time doing something you think is boring in the hopes that it will make you rich? All you'll be is a slightly well off bored person. 

It isn't hard though, and I personally find it quite engaging to read through financials and get a feel for a business, but I can completely understand that not everyone necessarily enjoys it as much as I do. I just want to say that there's no shame in that, it doesn't make you dumb or less valuable as a person, and honestly, a lot of people who claim to be ""sophisticated investors"" are only pretending to be better than you. SA is rife with those kinds of people, and all they're good at is making other people feel bad about making more money in some YOLO than they made in their bag holding.

I would encourage everyone to give value investing and doing research a try though, just in case you find yourself liking it. Plus, it never hurts to learn new things, so at the very least, you'll learn some financial accounting and that's useful in other areas of your life as well.

7,GME," So my first book on investing was the Intelligent Investor. I just dove right in and looked up every word I didn’t understand. I went through about 200 pages in a weekend, then the next 400-500 hurt a lot. It’s definitely something everyone should try to read. There’s some really good advice in there. Specifically looking at second tier companies in a bull market and looking at not so popular large companies during a bear market (expecting a turn around). 

Whatever you read, don’t try to correlate too much of it to what is happening now. There’s never been a time when the retail investor has had so much influence on the equities market than we do now. Communication, influence, etc is reaching 100’s of millions of people. We need to continue to recommend fundamentals to new investors and not let them waste money on speculation. Now on the flip side there’s something about ‘special conditions’ which  I think is what’s happened with GME. However an investor knows when to dip their toes and when to pull back. A new ‘speculator’ with no real plan, is more likely to lose it all. Which is what’s happened in previous crashes. Anyways, good post OP. Heading to chapters after work to grab one of your recommendations.

All the talk is ""disruption, tech, new paradigm, etc."". Then inevitably the market turns and companies with REAL CASH FLOWS and good balance sheets come back into favor. These are the investments that do well long-term - companies that have steady and increasing cash flow. This was Buffett's genius - if you pick a couple great companies that will be around for 20-30 years, they can increase cash flows over that time at eye-watering amounts. And that cash eventually gets returned to the investor by dividends, buybacks, and the market recognizing the hidden value that may not have been priced into the multiple. This is not even simply value investing - the best growth investors found great companies with positive cash flows that were able to grow over long periods.

All these people flocking and rotating in and out of the new hot company.

I 1000% over diversified for the funds I had, and it resulted in meager gains and lots of FOMO. And I get your catch phrases, but they didn't apply.

189,AAPL," Agree with other posters about consolidating your positions to simplify based on your risk tolerance, so I won’t go further into that.  For most of not nearly all people, the simpler, the better.  I have AAPL as my value stock and the rest are in very low expense ratio index funds through Vanguard (Roth IRA and brokerage) and my employer 403b through Fidelity.    The vast majority of my index funds are VTSAX and FXAIX.  I highly encourage you to read The Little Book of Common Sense Investing by John Bogle, the creator of Vanguard and of the first index fund.  Then read about the Three Fund Portfolio. 

I had a question regarding the type of account you are investing in.  Is it a regular brokerage account or a tax-advantaged account, such as a Roth IRA?  I would add for picks (generally funds such as VTI/VTSAX/BND) that you want to buy and allow grow over the years for retirement, max out your Roth IRA ($6000) every year for the tax benefits before. For individual stocks, keep it in your regular brokerage account. Also be aware of short and long term capital gains taxes if you plan to trade stocks often, as well as how to harvest any losses.

Going 80% on T is probably overkill, but it's good to know that we have the same opinion on that stock.

201,BYND," Solid DD and I'll add a couple of things.  I'm a convert myself - 9 months ago I thought PTON was just another BYND, but I've come around to really believing in the bull thesis.

1) The valuation actually isn't that bad.  The company is still in the growth phase so using earnings multiples is unfair.  On an EV/sales metric, we're looking at trailing EV/sales of 18 and forward EV/sales of only 9.  While they aren't direct competitors, just for reference you can compare those numbers to other growth stocks like ROKU (25/17 respectively) or ETSY (16/12) or DKNG (40/26) etc.

2) The one thing missing from your DD, and the major differentiator between PTON and any other competitor, is the brand value.  I'm not a PTON customer myself, but every person I've spoke to is absolutely in love with it.  Peloton has a cult following, not because of the hardware, but because of the content.  Their instructors are fitness celebrities and people love being part of the community.  Competitors can easily recreate the hardware but copying the content and cult factor is much, much more difficult.

One idea is also to look into what analysts are saying about the stock (to see if maybe they have some additional thoughts to add to your analysis) and it’s also good to have an idea of their price targets for context. 

Another is to actually make a DCF. E.g what kind of revenue growth, margins, etc do you need to reach your expected price targets?

Peers are of course the best to compare with, not sure if Netflix is the best example. They operate in different industries, have different margins, and are at different levels in the business cycle. But I understand it may be difficult in some cases.

Plus, competition doesn’t make me nervous-the biggest moat this company has is it gives the owners (majority women) the chance to tell everyone they worked out on their PTON!!!

211,DD," Nice DD. The financials could be better but frankly that stuffs kinda hard so I don't fault u. Idk how to approximate that stuff either for a early stage growth company like peloton. 

With this company I think ur either one of two ppl. U think it's a fad cause of wfh and are out. Or u think it's here to stay and got first mover benefits and a fantastic branding. 

I'm of the latter. Out of the competitors u posted iFit while it looks good, no one is buying that over peloton due to branding and marketting. Even echelon exists which is much cheaper but ppl still want to buy 'the real thing'. People call their pelotons , a peloton, not their indoor bike. The business model also features a lot of charismatic and popular (on social media) influencer type instructors which I'm a big fan of. On the employment side I've also seen them hire some legit ppl for R&D engineering which is a good sign for me. 

I think FUD this year will be a good entry point. Before it took off it was trading at around 70. But even at 90 is a really good buy for someone long term bullish.

One bear case for peloton and any real fitness related thing is the fad nature. Personally while I believe in the business look at soul cycle.

212,FB," Nice post! Personally I was thinking that PTON was definitely heading lower but you've given some great food for thought.

My bear case is related to the high valuation of the stock in terms of PE compared the high cost to purchase a bike and the high cost of subscription. The barrier to entry seems to high and the stock rallied on COVID demand which is likely to steeply decline once things open up and people can go back to the gym. Already there are so many fitness bikes up for sale on places like craigslist and FB marketplace as people sell off the bikes they purchased to exercise during quarantine. This doesn't bode well for Peloton, and I have a feeling people are going to have a harder time justifying a $500 per year subscription or making a new purchase for a $2000 bike when gyms and other fitness opportunities open back up in full. 

I think the two things you mention that could make for a bull case are the brand name and possible penetration into commercial gyms. I don't really know anything about how commercial gyms select equipment, so I can't really comment on this. Peloton has definitely built a brand name and I think it is interesting to see the social media aspect of fitness that they have captured but I wonder if that alone gives them a strong enough foothold or not. I would hope to see them build off of this and continue to develop their network and brand, but it's not totally clear how this would work and whether it will be profitable enough to drive the stock price upward.

220,DD," Thanks very much for the info! I'd class myself as a convert too. I wasn't bothered about the product and just chose it to practice DD on, but researching it has made me want their product and see the potential. 

I see what you mean about the brand value. I'm not their target market, but even I want one, and somehow I want it to be Peloton and not a different brand. It just has an image of being better. What that tells me is that their marketing psychology has worked on me. I'm too poor to buy it, but providing they still have that good reputation for their content and classes, I probably will in the future.

I didn't go much into the brand value since I view it as a variable that could change easily, especially in these early days, but you're right that it's a major factor that should be accounted for. I'll keep that in mind for future DDs.

223,DD," Thank you! I really appreciate your bearish input on it. 

The PE ratio is one of the reasons I picked this stock actually. I saw it was wildly overvalued, but then saw that analysts were giving it high PTs and I had no idea why or what the best position was, so I thought I'd practice DD on it to find out.

I agree with you regarding the barrier to entry. If PTON wasn't already aimed at the high-income sector I'd be bearish on it in that regard, but instead I'm of the belief that its high prices and cult-like brand are what is giving it the edge over many of its competitors post-pandemic. 

Although I think at-home fitness will continue to increase since it's more convenient (as well as the fact remote working has been given a boost by the pandemic), it makes sense that it will slow. However, I think people with higher incomes are going to be putting their convenience first because they can afford to do so, and the fact that PTON is focusing on the commercial sector unlike most of its competitors gives it some real potential.

The uncertainties for me are 1) The high-income market is limited, and 2) Will they be able to dominate gyms?

Like you, I'm not entirely sure about gyms. I think the fact they've already started supplying some gyms is a bullish sign, but the rest is where I'm betting and taking a risk.

I found [this resource](https://www.pelobuddy.com/travel/map/) that shows which gyms and hotels they're already in, but I haven't investigated yet whether this is enough for it to be a safe bet.

You make a good point about the high subscription price being justified, btw. It's fine for the high-income market, but if they plan to also get more of the middle and lower-income markets in future, charging $39.99/month to people who buy the equipment vs. charging only $12.99 to those without the equipment seems pretty silly since it won't encourage those outside of the high-income sector to purchase their equipment. In my opinion, they need to change their pricing model if they want to get a better market share there.",PrincessMonsterShark,2,/r/stocks/comments/m8g5f8/peloton_pton_dd_and_analysis/gri1b93/,0.052,0.794,0.154,0.9912

228,DD," Yeah that's a toughie because the high cost subscription is attractive for revenue, particularly considering that new sales will likely slow down with the high cost to buy. If they lower the subscription cost, then it hurts their revenue, and I'm not sure they will be able to find a pricing model that works.

I'm also thinking that it's more of a niche product that really boomed due to the COVID constraints. The problem is that the number of people who are big into fitness but would prefer to work out from home AND can/ are willing to buy a peloton and pay for the subscription is probably pretty low. For peloton to penetrate the gym market there would have to be a reason to buy their equipment over someone else, which would be the video services. But then there is this problem where their ideal customer works out at home so they don't benefit by getting into the gym space because you're not attracting customers with the option to use the peloton video at the gym (people aren't going to want to pay for a gym membership AND a peloton membership on top of that to use the peloton bike at the gym). 

There are probably creative ways around this and they might be able to innovate and create a strong foothold in this area but I think there are significant concerns. I would also be surprise to see this play out well in the short or even medium term... if they are able to establish a dominant role in the fitness industry and expand into these other avenues successfully, I think it would take years. It's interesting and exciting and if you do more DD and like the play then I say go for it, but my tendency is to believe the stock price will trend downwards and settle there for a bit.

230,PTON," Brilliant, I'm glad to hear that opinion from someone in the industry. :D Their potential to dominate gyms is what's had me most bullish tbh. They've already started supplying equipment to gyms, but whether or not they can become the new standard is still in question. From what I've read, gyms pay for a special subscription that allows anyone using the PTON machine to make their own account. This is why I think it could attract new customers for the hybrid home/gym fitness scheme, or attract the ones who give up the gym and decide to work out at home.

I agree, I don't think the hotel sector will be a huge source of income for them, but my thoughts were that having them, even in a small number of hotels, could draw new customers since they'll have a chance to try Peloton without having to fork out the money, and if they aim at higher-end hotels they'll be hitting their target market of high-income consumers who haven't yet been pulled into the Peloton craze.

244,SO," Investors aren’t buying 10 year tbills at current prices because they think their return will be eroded by inflation. The US government still auctions off new debt (increasing supply). If no one buys these bonds, but supply increases, the price of these bond decrease (causing yields to rise). 

This is bad for stocks in a few ways:

10 yr is used in a lot of valuation models as risk free rate. Higher discount rate means lower valuations. 

Rising yields also increase the cost of borrowing which means less available cash for growth initiatives. If the company can’t grow, neither can their stock price. 

Higher bond yields also make bonds more attractive leading to a rotation out of equities.. we haven’t really seen this yet, but I’d expect this if/when 10 yr hits around 3-3.5%. 

Rates are not high relative to historical norms but we’ve been in a suppressed environment for 10+ years. There is also SO MUCH debt right now, which is why small movement in rates has caused this much volatility.

We are in a very precarious situation. So far the FED has played its cards right, but one wrong move could blow up the bond market.",GratefulGoat,31,/r/stocks/comments/m84fqx/how_is_the_10yr_treasury_note_tied_to_inflation/grfj9d5/,0.095,0.822,0.083,-0.1927
245,CD," Its really not that complicated. If you think there is going to be inflation. Why would you buy a 1.5% bond? If rates zero and only headed up, less reason to buy bonds and lose money. With inflation picking up, yields rising, why would anyone buy bonds? The rate could go much higher. Now think about if your bank offered a savings account or CD with 5-6% guaranteed returns. How many people do you think will just say ""forget stocks"" and just park it in there for zero risk?",Squezeplay,9,/r/stocks/comments/m84fqx/how_is_the_10yr_treasury_note_tied_to_inflation/grfjbdq/,0.079,0.921,0.0,-0.7383
246,IMO," tl;dr Treasury bond interest rates control money supply which controls inflation. Increase in Treasury bond interest rates decrease money supply which decreases inflation, not increase. That means money is invested in Treasury bonds and not markets which makes market go down. Market going down might cause sell off which means cashing in investments and might cause crash. More people with money in hand might cause hyper inflation due to supply of goods and services decreasing while demand increases. But that might all be just speculation. One indicator of that is stock market is at all time highs. There's no reason for markets to be this high other than the money printed went to corporations listed on the stock exchange through people investing stimulus money instead of spending and the CARES Act. No one knows if a crash will happen, but fundamentals say it should. Fundamentals also say hyper inflation will happen, but fundamentals might be screwy right now.

&#x200B;

There's a lot to unpack to answer your question. It's not a direct relationship, it has to do with using money supply and interest rates to offset inflation/deflation and promote market investments.

The consumers determines inflation rate, the CPI just helps track it generally. Inflation/deflation in prices is constant and ongoing and it's actually region dependent, but most people don't notice because they don't see it until they go to buy something, and bulk volume of products/services helps to keep the price stable i.e. $5000 increase in cost of producing a bulk of 100 millions cans of Coke won't be noticed by individual consumers. Only time they'll notice is if they keep track and remember that something used to be cheaper. Inflation is just consumers bidding up the price of goods/services because they have money. The price of something will be whatever consumers in general are willing to pay. If they use credit to bid up prices then you have a bubble that is either sustained or popped depending on borrower's ability to repay. It's one of the reasons why ""printing"" money is supposed to cause inflation, because the idea is the money supply gets to the general public and will bid up the price on the limited quantity of goods and services. Inflation and deflation in small ranges is always happening to every product/service all the time as long as it's being bought/sold, nobody just announces the inflation rate and that's now somehow the inflation rate everyone must impose. However, they do exactly that with interest rates.

Take the above concept and relate it to cash/a $1 bill. Think of the $1 bill as a 0yr 0% interest bearing Treasury security. So if on day XX the price of a good is $1 and on that day you can pay and buy it. But then money supply is increased and let's say inflation rate is 2%, now you need more than $1 to buy the same product on day XX+1. This is just a generalized example, so don't take it as an exact event. So what inflation effectively does is it discounts the actual value of the $1, or what is also called the purchasing power. Now instead of $1 you need $1.02, and it's doesn't just stay at $1.02. The 2% will keep compounding until 10 purchase cycles later the seller won't sell for less than \~$1.22 unless something causes deflation and the price drops back down. Think oil prices.

When Treasury securities are bought you're exchanging cash for a government backed IOU with a expiry date. Corporations and people can exchange cash for IOU too but carries the risk of them saying screw you and not paying you back. That inherent risk discounts the price of said corporate/personal IOU, which is why they offer interest as incentive to buy the IOU. But inflation works against the interest rate, so if interest is 10% but inflation is 2% you're effectively only getting 8% return on investment. The risk of gov't not paying you depends on the stability of the country, so a US IOU is pretty solid and can offer a small interest rate to entice buyers whereas I don't know who would buy Congo IOU, they probably need higher interest rates in relation to US IOU if Congo Treasury securities even exist. I'm not into it personally, but apparently there's an international bond market with big money players. Financial and gov't institutions keep track of all this for themselves but not for you, which is why savings is garbage.

So with all that in the back burner, the thing you have to know about Treasury bonds is that they're marketable securities that are used as one of many tools to control the money supply which in turn helps influence inflation/deflation. So if there's a mechanism to push money into the public there also has to be a mechanism to pull that money back in to try to keep the currency stable. They can set the interest rate at whatever they want so long as it accomplished the goal, but make it too crazy and you cause destabilization. Typically when money is printed the interest rate on bonds go down because the whole point of printing money is to have the people spend it on goods and services, not spend it to buy Treasury bonds which defeats the purpose. So if Treasury bonds yield greater return than the general market (retailers, contractors, etc.) and/or the stock market, people will buy the Treasury bonds and give the money right back to the government. To discourage this behavior the bond interest rates are set low so that if people want to use their existing money to make profit then they spend/invest it in the market of goods/services. When the government wants to pull money back in it sets the interest higher. If they want a lot they set it a lot higher, if they only want a little back they set it a little higher.

What's so interesting right now is that in the past year the money supply was increased/printed by more than 65% during a mandated lockdown that destroyed lots of ""non-essential"" small to mid size businesses, and yet hyperinflation hasn't happened. So the $4 trillion dollar question is, what in the F is going on?

Less businesses should mean less supply of goods and services which should mean massive increase to inflation, but because it was mostly small to mid size businesses that weren't ""essential"" the supply of goods didn't go down enough for drastic prices changes. Most of the price changes seem to be the result of supply chain disruptions that never recovered and not the money printed. But then where did the increased money supply go? It was spent/funneled to the ""essential"" big businesses that were allowed to stay open during the lockdowns which is reflected in the stock market being at record highs. Unfortunately this would also mean that the stock market is currently the most over inflated bubble of all time which is why there's so much talk about a coming crash, and if a crash does happen it's expected to be at least twice as worse as the 2008 crash. Market crash means people are pulling out their money out of investments and either spending it or putting it somewhere else which could be the trigger to hyper inflation. It's all conjecture at this point with higher chances on increased inflation but the mechanisms are all so distorted IMO it's a toss up. But I wouldn't be surprised if Treasury bond interest rates go even higher before the next election cycle.

329,RKT," Yeah I do a mix of high volatility trading on the short term and try to find nuggets to buy and hold for longer term growth / gains.  There’s a lot of overlap in the tickers though, since anything small and unproven with a lower float is going to be pretty volatile already.

The shorts seem to have three main strategies I’ve noticed.   First is run a company into the ground, drive away investors, and try to kill it.   That’s what was essentially happening with the recent meme explosion before DFV did his thing.    The second strategy is to keep prices down through manipulation while buying up larger stakes or option plays before releasing the pressure.   RKT for example.   If you have enough capital to move the market price down, then let regular buyers move it up for you, you can print money with options.   I see a lot of that happening.    The third strategy is just to drive volatility high to sell options, then let it settle for a week to buy them back with the reduced Vega.   You don’t need as much capital to do this and I’m assuming it’s smaller short players, just get enough swing to drive Vega up then stop and let it rest before they buy back.

None of those strategies make it easy to trade the stock based on traditional methods, as a huge 10% drop could come at any moment in a rally.   So if I’m trading swings or whatever it’s too much risk, and if I’m selling options against a longer term hold it’s got to sync with whatever they’re doing to make the most of it.   As a result I generally prefer lower short interest, but not zero short interest, as it works best with my system.",rgar132,1,/r/stocks/comments/m82xja/how_to_search_for_growth_stocks/grfb49u/,0.046,0.874,0.08,0.9032

Currently trying to teach myself options. I work in insurance and financial services but have no Series 6, etc and only handle the insurance end. I have become obsessed learning about companies, EPC's, reading charts etc.

Growing up, my parents never read me the normal books like fables or Dr. Seuss. From the age of eight, we read kids books about stocks and discussed... 😒


For my birthday and Christmas, I was given stock in a company along with a gift that that company produced. For example, one year I got Disney stock so we went to Disney World. 

They were parents that loved to flaunt their money and were also complete and total assholes. Stole accounts to build their own business, and basically screwed everyone on their way to the top. I don't have much communication with them now.

One mistake they did make was setting up all my accounts as UTMA's. As soon as I was of age, I cashed them out for extra college spending, travelling with friends and footing the bill most times. One of the dumbest mistakes I could have ever made, as I would be sitting pretty darn good right now if I had left it in the markets.

366,AMD," I've committed to this idea. I am trying to put a good chunk of money into the market and I have been picking anything with a ""fair value"" and buying 20 to 30 percent of my position depending on my confidence level. For instance, if I want in on AMD but it is an overheated sector then I am a bit bearish in price over the next few months. Of course I could be wrong. Let's say I want to have 3 percent of my portfolio (let's just say that would be $1000 for example) in this position but for starters I am going with 20 percent.... $200. I buy 3 shares @ $80/ea for $240.

I will then wait for a pullback of over 5 percent below my last purchase price. Higher depending on how volatile the stock is. Let's say I purchase an additional 5 shares every time it drops 8% below my last purchase price for AMD. This is a really conservative example and could be done with a number of different ratios. I just don't want to get burned in a sell off everyone keeps talking about so I am treading lightly on my positions. It also can drop 5 percent in a single day without much trouble recently. My ""bottom"" for this would be back to pre-covid levels which would be a really severe sell off and almost completely unlikely.   


3 shares @ $80 - $240  
3 shares @ $73.60 - $220.8  
3 shares @ $67.71 - $203.13  
3 shares @ $62.29 - $186.87  
3 shares @ $57.31 - $171.93

Total position - $1,022.73

Cost basis - 15 shares @ $68.18/ea

Obviously this is a bit rough when the price is only $57 and you have a $68 cost basis but this would be worst case scenario. You also didn't over leverage yourself into a single position and were able to ride the price down roughly 30 percent over possibly a couple of months. On the flip side if the price goes up... and up... and up.... you only have $200 in and wanted $1000. I personally say ""oh well"" and wait for a serious pull back in the future but I won't chase the price up. I will be content with my small position and put money into a different company. 

I am a bit more bearish about the rest of 2021 so this is my strategy getting into new positions. I will go with 30+ percent on my opening position if I really believe in the company regardless of share price. Hopefully I am wrong and I have a bunch of small positions doing really well!

369,ONE," This is very interesting.

We need a little more info.

Let's say for easy math that you bought 100 shares of XYZ on Monday morning for $10.00 each.

You immediately set up ONE auto sell order for all 100 shares at $11.00 each.

When the stock spiked that day, the system recognized your auto sell at $11.00 per share, but did not sell it all, instead selling part in two separate transactions?

The only way you would end up with two separate transactions and/or prices, is if you were using the MARKET price function (never use) instead of the LIMIT price function (always use).

Now, sometimes when your auto buy/sell order triggers, then pops up on an algorithm to process, or occasionally comes across a real live broker's screen to fill... sometimes they cannot find (buying) or get rid of (selling) the stock in question all in one lump, which results in two or three transactions to fill the entire order.

451,GME," A trailing stop essentially has a ""following"" threshold that follows the price of the stock below(sell)/above(buy) by the set amount(% or $)... but the threshold will not go down(sell)/up(buy).

So say your sell trailing stop is 5$ and the stock is 100.

This means that it will sell if the stock drops below 95$. If the stock goes to 110$ then it will sell if the stock drops 110$-5$ = 105$. If it goes to 200$ then it will sell at 195$. 

So basically you will loose 5$ whatever the stock does because if it was 200$ you could have sold it at 200$ but it got sold automatically at 195$. 

This is good if you want to ""lock in"" your gains. You won't get the maximum theoretical gains but you can at least lock them in. 

Buy work exactly the same except everything is mirrored.  If you put in a buy trailing stop of 5$ then the threshold is always 5$ above the stock price and if it goes up past the threshold you'll buy before it gets any higher.

Think of the trailing stop as a sort of ""automated"" of what you do. As you monitor the price you will say if it goes down below 5$(or whatever) I'll sell it but as the stock guys up in price you keep saying this. 

&#x200B;

The math is basically, for a sell, ""if Last Maximum Price - Threshold Price > Price then sell""

The idea is very simple, you want to sell when the stock reaches it's maximum price(that maximizes your returns). The problem is that a stock fluctuates quite a bit so you can't just set the limit to what you think the max is because it will almost surely sell off immediately(that would be a limit order). So you allow some ""cushion"" for the stock to vary. If you set the threshold to low, say 1% and the stock is jumping 2% around as it goes up then you'll sell the stock before you can recognize the gains. The downside is that you limit your profits because you lose the threshold. E.g., if you set a 1% threshold then you will lose 1% of the max profits. (this isn't a huge deal because you can never predict the max)

&#x200B;

The real problem is that in volatility  you can lose a lot more than than it looks. I set a trailing stop at 380$ for 360$ for GME and people sold off and I ended up with 317$. I didn't get the 360$. The reason is the shorters sold off so much so quick that the price dropped too fast to trigger the sell in time. By the time the brokerage got to my order the price dropped from 380$ to 317$. That is a significant loss of profit. This is why HF's pay to get their orders taken care of first so they don't have these problems. It's also why they do these short attacks so they can make people lose money this way.",EternalDissonance,1,/r/stocks/comments/m8m7e8/question_about_trailing_stop_buy_want_to_know_for/griqyvf/,0.096,0.824,0.08,-0.8214

454,AMD," I literally just posted the info below on another thread but it is relevant here. I made a big mistake keeping a lot of cash out before covid crash happened but never actually putting it back into the market at the bottom. I kept waiting for the next ""covid variant"" to kill the momentum, etc. When January rolled around I realized I just flat out missed out and here I am. I am hesitant as ever to just stick the entire sum into the market right now so I committed to the idea of DCA. At some point it will pay off. 

I am trying to put a good chunk of money into the market and I have been picking anything with a ""fair value"" and buying 20 to 30 percent of my position depending on my confidence level. For instance, if I want in on AMD but it is an overheated sector then I am a bit bearish in price over the next few months. Of course I could be wrong. Let's say I want to have 3 percent of my portfolio (let's just say that would be $1000 for example) in this position but for starters I am going with 20 percent.... $200. I buy 3 shares @ $80/ea for $240.

I will then wait for a pullback of over 5 percent below my last purchase price. Higher depending on how volatile the stock is. Let's say I purchase an additional 5 shares every time it drops 8% below my last purchase price for AMD. This is a really conservative example and could be done with a number of different ratios. I just don't want to get burned in a sell off everyone keeps talking about so I am treading lightly on my positions. It also can drop 5 percent in a single day without much trouble recently. My ""bottom"" for this would be back to pre-covid levels which would be a really severe sell off and almost completely unlikely.

3 shares @ $80 - $240  
3 shares @ $73.60 - $220.8  
3 shares @ $67.71 - $203.13  
3 shares @ $62.29 - $186.87  
3 shares @ $57.31 - $171.93

Total position - $1,022.73

Cost basis - 15 shares @ $68.18/ea

Obviously this is a bit rough when the price is only $57 and you have a $68 cost basis but this would be worst case scenario. You also didn't over leverage yourself into a single position and were able to ride the price down roughly 30 percent over possibly a couple of months. On the flip side if the price goes up... and up... and up.... you only have $200 in and wanted $1000. I personally say ""oh well"" and wait for a serious pull back in the future but I won't chase the price up. I will be content with my small position and put money into a different company.

I am a bit more bearish about the rest of 2021 so this is my strategy getting into new positions. I will go with 30+ percent on my opening position if I really believe in the company regardless of share price. Hopefully I am wrong and I have a bunch of small positions doing really well!

471,AT," A short put is where you sell or ""write"" a put contract that didn't previously exist. You are selling someone else the right (but not the obligation) to sell you 100 shares of the stock at the strike price, before or on the expiration date. You're the one who has to buy if the holder chooses to exercise their put. If the option is exercised, you call this ""getting assigned"" or ""assignment.""

&#x200B;

A covered put is where you're already short 100 shares of that stock, so if the you get assigned and have to buy someone else's shares, you're covering your shortsold shares, at the strike price. A cash-secured short put is where you don't actually shortsell those 100 shares, but you have enough cash to cover being assigned if it happens anyway, and put that up.

&#x200B;

If you have a cash-secured put, you must keep the required cash to pay for the possible exercise of that put, in your account, at all times, until AFTER expiration or assignment. So if it's a strike of $50, you need to keep $5,000 cash in your account AT ALL TIMES until this option goes away one way or another.

oh ok that makes more sense.

i moved from Robinhood to TOS. and in Robinhood, they would literally tie up the cash collateral for a CSP.

so i was wondering how you would 1. do a CSP on tos, if they do or do not tie up the required capital as well. 2. how you would do a short put position without typing up the cash and how that would look like. if that means you would be paying another different price if the underlying drops way below strike.

so what happens if i try to enter a short position without the cash on hand? does TOS deny the trade to go through?

i understand why naked covered calls and short positions on the underlying is dangerous. but i dont quite see why for a short put. because cant i simply put the money into my account if i get assigned to buy? since the min price ill have to pay is still the strike price?",AIONisMINE,1,/r/stocks/comments/m8cl28/what_exactly_is_a_naked_short_put_position/grhwzf5/,0.07,0.904,0.025,-0.8629

500,JPM," I've been long JPM for several months now as part of my portfolio rebalance away from growth, towards value and other reopening stocks.  Rising interest rates are good for the financial sector.",SirGasleak,1,/r/stocks/comments/m8g4sw/jpm_thoughts/grh9buy/,0.0,0.72,0.28,0.872
501,JPM," The reason why JPM is currently rising when everything else (tech) is falling is that banks have a positive correlation with rising interest rates. Interest rates are, in effect, the banks' margins. Therefore, it does not hurt to invest a certain part of the portfolio in bank stocks to protect against rising interest rates.

&#x200B;

And to your other question, I think JPM is a great stock, makes up about 25% of my portfolio. It's by far the best bank you can have. How far it will go I can't estimate. Maybe up to 170/180? But then they would be very expensive.",GordonGekkoVienna,1,/r/stocks/comments/m8g4sw/jpm_thoughts/gri2d8j/,0.014,0.744,0.243,0.9794
502,ID, I am an amateur so hopefully someone can confirm or correct this information but it’s my understanding that a split can occur for a lot of reasons and those are the factors you want to ID. The split just changes someone’s 10 shares for $10 into 100 shares for $1. I don’t believe a split favors a move in either direction without knowing the mentality behind it.,Dcook0323,1,/r/stocks/comments/m8bshv/bankers_trust_massive_drop/grh6pt1/,0.0,0.826,0.174,0.8688
503,IBKR," Hello fellow countryman/woman,

I use Tiger and MooMoo seems like the new kid on the block with all the aggressive advertising I see on MRT.

Most people I know use a mixture of IBKR and Tiger .

504,TA," Married to a former diesel mechanic (now shop manager)...we don't have any positions in Snap On. I don't see the sector having much growth potential and the whole Snap On VS Matco is up there with Chevy VS Ford for rednecks and trucks. People get into one camp or the other and stay irrationally loyal to it for life. Plus, tool trucks are nice but flea market Snap On is booming and the truck bill is first thing defaulted on if the COVID recession is indeed coming. 

We do have positions in TA, Penske, and Werner.  He wants Ryder but the charts don't get me excited.  I will also periodically swing steel companies and ones that make the bearings/parts for tools. That said, Snap On is a solid company.  If your investment goal right now is low to moderate growth and you're a little older they are probably not a bad choice. Its certainly one I would put on a watch list to do a wheel strategy on.

506,USA," Yes, almost all of their core hand tools are still USA made. Great product, great service if you have a good dealer (still good service online) but they're still pricey and the tool truck model is losing business the same way traditional retail stores are. You can buy everything online. The only Snap on tools I buy I pay cash for, so I don't think Snap On likes me much. They make a LOT of their revenue from financing if I recall which kind of sucks. Techs near me buy a fair bit of tools from them, a new tool or set of tools every few weeks I'd say but they also end up warrantying out tons of tools too. Lights etc have to be major losses for Snap On. No way I would touch this after this run up.",_Please,3,/r/stocks/comments/m8792l/sna_snap_on_incorporated/grg4k7w/,0.099,0.773,0.128,0.3737

They told me if I end up getting trader status then I no longer can off set capital loss with capital gains.

So all my gains are tax free until I use up my capital loss. I might go to TTS and 475 mark to Mark election after I'm all good.",Worldofmeb,1,/r/stocks/comments/m853xz/any_tax_consequences_for_high_volune_trading/grfk628/,0.143,0.637,0.22,0.836
