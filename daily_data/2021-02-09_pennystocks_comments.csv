0,DD," This is exceptional advice.  A few additional things I have found:

- For every great buy you will find on here, you have to go through 20-50 others that either are not that good or you are too late for.  I always first look at a stock chart on each stock.  If a stock has already made a huge jump from say $.05 to $.85... I say, “Crap, missed my chance there.  How could I have caught that before it shot up?”  But jumping into a stock after a huge jump turn out to be a bad move more often than a good one.  But overall, I gather up 20-30 interesting stocks, that I will sort through hoping to find 1 or 2 that I may actually throw money at.

- When I put money at anything under $2, I always put in a sell order right away for one half my shares if it doubles.  So, if I buy 1,000 shares of something for $.45, I will put add a sell limit order of 500 shares at $.90.  That is a hedge that allows me to get my entire investment back while still having a stake.  By cashing my initial investment, I can be more aggressive or patient with my remaining shares - it is basically house money at that point.  It is crazy how many times doing this paid off way quicker than I expected.  I can’t watch the market all day during work hours.

- Ask questions in the DD threads.  I have seen lots of people in this sub say that they don’t understand the financials and other tools evaluation.  Most every one here will go out of their way to teach you whatever you don’t know.  If you learn it, you can then help do your own DD and let us move through more prospects more quickly.  

- I try to limit my new investments to about one new stock a week.  I honestly don’t know how you could do enough DD on much more than a couple a week - which I find it is helpful to ask which one is best than just throwing money at everything that looks promising.   Say you have three EV stocks you are looking at.  I find it is best to force myself to pick the best.  Also, if you jump on the daily thread and pick 20 tickers to throw money at, you would be well served to slow down and get more judicious about your targets.

5,CEO," There's many ways to invest in the market, most ""penny stock traders"" are grifters at some level, playing hot potato with hand grenades, because they don't care what they're actually invested in, they just want to follow volume for their gains.

I've invested in microcap stocks for twenty years and have a CAGR of about 23% over that time span, including major market pull backs in 2000 and 2008.

If I was going to pontificate like I was some all knowing microcap investor, my advice would be quite different:

1.) First and foremost - Know the capital structure of the company. Read the most recent quarterly report and annual reports to understand how many shares are outstanding, how much is owned by insiders, and if there are any convertible notes outstanding. These factors are what distinguishes a company trying to make a real go of their business from the Johny come lately penny stocks that will dilute themselves into oblivion in a year.  I look for companies with less than 100 million shares outstanding, insiders own at least 15% so their interests are aligned with common shareholders, and no convertible notes with funky conversion terms at a discount, or below market prices. Fixed conversion financing should be available to any real companies with half a chance at success.  

2.) Favor companies that have actual operations, revenues, and preferably profits.  Investing in Unicorns is a fairy tale game down here, most Unicorns stay private until IPO.  What we look for down here is the pegasus, companies that are profitable and able to self fund their growth, or at least command better terms for financing because of their financial strengths.  

3.)  As Warren Buffet said, ""If you aren't willing to own a stock for ten years, don't even think about owning it for ten minutes.""

Some of my biggest winners fit this mold perfectly, I found XPEL @ $0.35, the CEO was so greedy with his shares, he didn't even grant options to high performing employees, now he's built his business into a highly profitable and highly valued company trading around $45 today. I found MED @ $0.95, profitable at a small scale in the early 2ks, still profitable now, at a much higher scale.  

The point is, if you want to have long-term success in investing, don't play with crap, just because its in play.  Its bad karma to try to polish a turd.",zenvesting4U,4,/r/pennystocks/comments/lfvrxo/advice_for_new_and_serious_traders/gmpg6q8/,0.045,0.769,0.186,0.9958

One slight addition I would like to get your opinion on around point 3. Recently, what I have been doing when a stock I own does well is redo my DD once it reaches a certain point before I decide to sell or hold. Say I didn't have any positions, would I still buy or not buy. If I would buy, I hold, if I wouldn't I sell. Additionally, I have realized the FOMO is quite extensive for me personally so if I do decide to sell, I would recover my investment, get a little extra out and let the rest grow so I don't have that FOMO.",Rmandhana1998,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/lfvrxo/advice_for_new_and_serious_traders/gmou8u3/,0.0,0.867,0.133,0.9134
28,BE," While taking to account what OP has said, I would like to add a point on the DD part. Let's say you a stock rising and you don't have time to do your DD but want to catch the wave while the price is surging up and up. If you want to do a risk play and want to put your money in, then do it BUT, just think to yourself, the money that you put in, imagine you've always lost it because this can go either way. NEVER PUT TAKE THIS RISK WHEN THERE IS A EXTREMELY HUGE JUMP! I normally do this but if the jump exceeds more than 0.05c I don't throw a lot of money into it because It can crash anything but if the jump if more than 0.10c just know be ready to lose if it does start to go down.

One more thing to that, if you decide to take that risk, do not hesitate. The amount of times I've hesitated even for mere minutes, is bad. I saw a stock at 0.10 and see it go to 0.11, and now I think let's wait for it come back down to 0.10 but it doesn't, it goes to 12 then 13 14 15, and in that hesitation moment you've already some profit that you could have gained if you didn't hesitate.

REMEMBER WHAT I HAVE SAID IS A VERY VERY RISKY PLAY! I DEFINITELY WOULDN'T RECOMMEND DOING THIS IF YOU'RE NEW TO THE MARKET BUT AFTER A FEW WEEKS OF TRADING, THIS MIGHT BE A GOOD SORT OF THING TO DO CATCH EARLY PROFITS AND RIDE THE WAVE AND BACK OUT BEFORE IT CRASHES CAUSE IT WILL CRASH.

If you want to do a risk play and want to put your money in, then do it BUT, just think to yourself, the money that you put in, imagine you've always lost it because this can go either way. NEVER PUT TAKE THIS RISK WHEN THERE IS A EXTREMELY HUGE JUMP! I normally do this but if the jump exceeds more than 0.05c I don't throw a lot of money into it because It can crash anything but if the jump if more than 0.10c just know be ready to lose if it does start to go down.

One more thing to that, if you decide to take that risk, do not hesitate. The amount of times I've hesitated even for mere minutes, is bad. I saw a stock at 0.10 and see it go to 0.11, and now I think let's wait for it come back down to 0.10 but it doesn't, it goes to 12 then 13 14 15, and in that hesitation moment you've already some profit that you could have gained if you didn't hesitate.

REMEMBER WHAT I HAVE SAID IS A VERY VERY RISKY PLAY! I DEFINITELY WOULDN'T RECOMMEND DOING THIS IF YOU'RE NEW TO THE MARKET BUT AFTER A FEW WEEKS OF TRADING, THIS MIGHT BE A GOOD SORT OF THING TO DO CATCH EARLY PROFITS AND RIDE THE WAVE AND BACK OUT BEFORE IT CRASHES CAUSE IT WILL CRASH.

If you have less than £1000, do not try this as its harder to average down afterwards.

36,PDT," To anyone who is interested! 
The app I currently use is So-Fi.
It is great for beginners. There are no account or trade fees, no minimum amount to start investing and it's very easy to navigate through. 
It's available for anyone living in the United states. Be careful because if you are investing less than $25,000, then you are allowed certain amount of trades. ( Allowed to trade 3 times in a day for 5 business days). If you cross the limit you will be PDT (Pattern Day Trader) listed and your account can get blocked.

Also, they have a referral option, invite people with your link, have them deposit $1,000.00 and you each get a $50.00 stock (recommend this to individuals who KNOW what they are doing). Share the link with your friends and family.
Enjoy!

41,DD," I have seen some of the other comments before the bot got them.  One asked about my half of my shares at double the price and choosing some other number, say 2/3 shares on 50% increase.  I do that many times, but for me, if I ever hit the double point, I always get half my shares out and recover my initial investment.  That is just one of my unbreakable rules I have.  Sometimes it hurts to do it, but I find you need rules to govern your trades.  I know I have left money on the table at times by doing that, but overall, it has been a good call and second, it is good for my mental health.  I don’t have to second guess things.  I am not saying that 50% sold at 100% price gain is the right target for anyone else, but it is a good rule for me and what stock I try to chase.

I also have a 30% loss rule on sub $2 stocks.  They are usually pink sheets and if there is a 30% drop, that usually means I missed something in my DD and it is better to cut losses before trying to figure out what I missed.  There is plenty of time afterwards to figure out what the hell happened.",SnidelyWhiplash1,106,/r/pennystocks/comments/lfvrxo/advice_for_new_and_serious_traders/gmol5zg/,0.116,0.764,0.12,-0.2846

43,DCF," I think it’s a good idea to have different pre-determined initial allocation amounts as well and be strategic with capital allocation.

With risk capital - pick an amount that is small enough that if you throw it into a stock that zeros it won’t negatively effect your portfolio. That amount is going to be different, for me I have that as 0.5% of my portfolio value. If it goes to 5000%, great, if 0%, that’s also fine too. I do this for entirely speculative buys to combat the FOMO feeling. Lottery tickets or gambling, however you want to view it.

For positions that have been researched lightly, 2% of portfolio size. I like being able to rely on other people’s DD when I trust them, but then I will do my own scan through annual reports and filings to make sure that there’s a compelling thesis for why the company can and will make money, plus, seeing the financials and getting a view on the trending within the F/S and B/S is important.

For researched positions, this is where I start to take bigger positions and weight based on conviction. 2% is the starting point for low conviction and then up to 6% if I am the highest conviction. Something really helpful is to fill out a standardized template for your investment thesis. It’s good discipline and forcing yourself to work through a DCF, understand the competitive landscape for the industry and the bull/bear case can prevent some bad decisions.",iojoh,9,/r/pennystocks/comments/lfvrxo/advice_for_new_and_serious_traders/gmoxpfa/,0.041,0.825,0.134,0.9445

It is a sort of a “What the hell...” reaction.  Honestly, they usually go the wrong direction, but it is entertainment more than investing.  But I never go over $50 without doing DD.  That is my personal limit and I don’t do these impulsive trades very often.  For example... I saw a Greenland rare earth element mining company. No idea yet, but it sounds cool.  Put $20 on a whim at some shares at $.20 or so.  Sure, why not?  I have wasted $20 on way more stupid things than that.

64,DD," The very best advice I can give is to learn how to read a balance sheet and a P&L.  I am sure there are some videos on YouTube or definitely some webpages you can learn from.  I would make sure I knew what all the fields on those documents are so that you can quickly discern what is going on with the finances of a company.  Figure out where the recurring operating expenses are  versus the one-time capital expenses or write-downs.  Finally learn some basic tax concepts.  For example, it is good to understand depreciation and how stock awards and options are accounted for.  Also, learn the difference between how cash-basis and accrual accounting work.

You can't use the same kind of metrics as you would for stock. That is the price you pay getting into a new market that is different from anything else we've had before. You might see it is a bubble, unless you think that corporations getting in the game (Microstrategy, Tesla, potentially Apple etc) is an indication that it is not a bubble market.     

If you wanted to get into the value of networks and try to gauge value that way you could try to use metcalfe's law, but that won't tell the whole story.

119,OCGN," Well, so far I've learned three golden rules through my own trial and error that have been reinforced as I browse this subreddit.

First: **Go with what you know**. For example I have a medical background, so I have been gravitating towards those stocks. If you don't understand a company or how or why they'd be valuable then it's just not worth having in your portfolio. My thought is if I can't explain to someone in a single sentence what that company does then it's really not worth trying to justify the investment.

Secondly: **Informed intuition**. This is just innate intuition coupled with recognizing what the company does, how they're performing, and what the expectations are. I looked at OCGN early last week and had a hunch, but simply had no money to capitalize on my hunch. And sure enough I watched it skyrocket from a dollar and change to 15 (currently at 13 and change and falling). Even if I could have capitalized on it it wouldn't have been much, but it would have been something. Maybe a couple of hundred profit. Once again, I looked at ZOM at the same time, but same situation.

And tertiarily, the Elsa rule: **Let it go**. I wish I could have capitalized on OCGN and ZOM as I'd predicted, even in a small way, but I just couldn't. I'm broke and only had a couple of hundred I could set aside to invest, and it was tied up in other stocks I couldn't get rid of without facing penalties I don't feel are worth it at my financial level. But if I let myself get caught up in what could have been I can't make decisions about what is and what I can do in the moment. There'll be other opportunities moving forward.

136,EV," OP, TLOFF looks very interesting but I think you’re underestimating its potential. For one, the EV domestic market will be much bigger than just TESLA. GM just made a major commitment to it and others are or will follow suit soon. And why, because the Biden administration will pass policy to encourage more environmentally friendly industries and to invest and buy American. That means increased tax breaks or credits and regulatory benefits that will greatly favor Talon Metals to be a partner over international options even if they are more mature.

I can speak from experience as someone who was in the ground floor of the biofuels industry that popped up nearly overnight from the Renewable Fuel Standards established in 2007 that added mandatory ethanol to gasoline. A combination of tax breaks, border tariffs and regulatory requirements made it far more attractive for us to get our ethanol made from Midwestern corn than cheaper and more efficiently farmed sugar beets from Brazil. The same could easily apply here where domestic nickel producers would be given a leg up against international competition.

In short, the future potential is bigger and brighter than you think if Talon Metals can perform as expected.

140,VERY," The case you make is very convincing, save for one VERY IMPORTANT thing: 

There are literally ZERO references to back up your claims besides your (supposed) brother’s word of mouth. No links to [articles](https://cleantechnica.com/2020/11/21/nickel-nickel-nickel-diving-into-green-nickel-with-talon-metals/) / [statements](https://talonmetals.com/talon-metals-comments-on-tesla-battery-day-and-its-critical-role-in-meeting-the-growing-demand-for-green-nickel/) supporting the claim of “Green Nickel”, nor the quality of nickel in the Tamarack site, nor the proprietary refining process. Not even to the statement you quoted wherein Talon refused to deny a partnership.

Edit: [New discoveries refute the following claim](https://www.proactiveinvestors.com/companies/news/939502/talon-metals-corp-hits-record-breaking-hole-at-tamarack-nickel-copper-cobalt-project-939502.html)

>	~~Furthermore, Talon and the Tamarack deposit don’t even crack the top 8 largest deposits in the world. If Tesla is looking to scale up, can Tamarack provide enough product to meet the demand?~~

One more thing. If Tesla is building a factory in Indonesia, why would they want to ship metals across the ocean both ways? Wouldn’t an Australian mine make more sense?

Edit: If Talon *can* produce battery-ready nickel themselves, then sea lanes become a moot point. However, I haven’t found anything to support this.

Another thing that can’t be overlooked is their joint venture with Rio Tinto (RIO: $80.29) at Tamarack, which may complicate a partnership with Tesla.

Tesla wants clean, domestic nickel. Talon Metals will be the ONLY source of clean, domestic nickel.

""Rio Tinto, which owns roughly $80 billion in mineral resources around the world, had previously pushed exploration of the Tamarack deposit, but eventually handed the initiative over to Talon.""

Here's info on that relationship with RIO: [https://talonmetals.com/show-me-your-deal-structure-with-rio-tinto/](https://talonmetals.com/show-me-your-deal-structure-with-rio-tinto/)

&#x200B;

Also:

""While the exploration has been little publicized so far, a mine in such a location raises concerns about water pollution and other environmental damage. When the type of rock being targeted is dug up and exposed to air and water, it can create acid that absorbs other harmful substances from the rock and runs into nearby lakes and rivers.""

Totally forgot about it... Fast forward a few months later I randomly was speaking to my brother-in-law yesterday (a 19 year mining professional familiar with North American nickel/cobalt/etc mining) and his insight into the extreme push for North American nickel blew my mind. Long story short he said expect big things from North American nickel in 2021 and US nickel producers were 100% on Tesla’s radar and it’s literally what his co-workers are talking about. The guy doesn’t even care about the stock market, had absolutely zero incentive to tell me this. He could tell I was interested in it and he was excited to tell me because it was a rapid change in his industry. He was emphatic that US nickel mining was going to play a pivotal role in the EV craze, and very soon.

Even if for some reason a Tesla deal doesn’t happen despite Talon Metals being the ONLY US based nickel mining company capable of being a major player in the EV supply chain (not to mention their strategic partnership with global mining super power Rio Tanto) TLOFF is still going 2-3x by end of year in my opinion. Piedmont Lithium had zero customers and zero mined lithium when they just got a 5 year deal with Tesla. Talon Metals is already in a better position and has a world class partner in Rio Tanto. The stars are aligning here for a huge 2021 for TLOFF, in my opinion of course.

213,ICE," It sounds like Talon is in a great position long-term, and potentially from other car makers, but I don't see any short-term news coming from Tesla when they've literally been announcing their intentions to make batteries in Indonesia this week, in partnership with a couple other battery makers.

I might still grab some for long-term gains, but it doesn't exactly have rocket penny written on it :) Appreciate the heads up though, mining is really fun to look into.

I should clarify my thinking about other car makers...I think Tesla is in for a world of hurt from established makers in the next couple of years. They are starting to make non-compliance cars, like the new Ford Mustang, with self-driving features, huge range, awesome acceleration, etc. Toyota, Volvo, Mazda, Hyundai are all jumping in too, and it's about to get crazy.

I honestly think ICE engines are going to disappear faster than most people anticipate, I would love to take advantage of the intuition.",grumpyfatguy,3,/r/pennystocks/comments/lfmvdh/talon_metals_tloff_is_very_likely_to_go_10x_and/gmnkcnz/,0.052,0.723,0.226,0.9882

EVs are the future and it’s more obvious now than ever, which is precisely why I want to be in on the largest American nickel producer. Talon Metals has made it clear their intention is to be a major supplier of clean nickel for the EV market and they’re in a prime position to do it.

Also, Tesla purchased lithium mining rights in Nevada and signed a five year agreement with a lithium mine in North Carolina, all within a couple months of each other.

Other cathode materials for the cathode are iron phosphate. But in ALL CASES you need lithium as the anode.

275,BP," Yeah, he was one of Cleveland Clinic's star patients. Got stage 4 GBFM first in 2009, tried an experimental trial and it helped out and went into remission. One of the rare 2% that had a 10+ year survival rate. He had a really good 9 years and even did some presentations for his doctor to help the cause.  


Sadly it came back in 2019 and treatment was unresponsive. I never wish brain cancer on anyone. It's sad seeing people mentally go. He was a chemical/environmental engineer, had a bachelors from michigan and masters from MIT and got a MBA from Case Western. He was extremely intellegient and it was a shame seeing him slowly fade mentally. At least he was home in hospice surrounded by loved ones during his final year and not in the whole covid family banned nursing home.  We lucked out there.  


If you ever work with chemicals (and back in the 80s BP and other major oil industries weren't known for it's best precautionary practices, a lot of people got pancreatic/brain cancer from what I heard), ALWAYS wear protective gear.

Penny stocks have been around for a long time but I think they are “in fashion” right now. People have had a tough year and if something sounds like “OMG I COULD DOUBLE MY MONEY OVERNIGHT” then it’s easy to get caught up in the hype.

318,RH," I moved off Robinhood and did a full transfer to TDA. A couple things to pay attention to: Robinhood charges a transfer fee ($75). Some places like TDA don't do fractional shares so fractional shares will be sold off.

371,EV," OK - I'm with you, let me explain my math.

FY21 mean broker revenue estimate: $177.6m (the \~$250m is for FY22)

EV = 15.7x \* $177.6m = $2,793.6m

Net debt I have taken from Thomson Eikon (think of it like a cheap home Bloomberg terminal) and that figure is $30.88m. Definition and calculation of net debt can differ, so every chance Thomson Eikon have it wrong, however I did double check vs Seeking Alpha which shows the same (cash of 5.6, debt of 36.5).

Deduct the net debt from the enterprise value to get your market cap: 2,793.6 - 30.9 = $2,762.8 (I think in your calculation you have added the net debt when deriving equity value, so in a way double counting it).

Again, shares outstanding figure can be subject to different calculations, I took Thomson Eikon again for simplicity, but every chance another source may have not adjusted / reflected the dilution from something vesting or being executed, or whatever. Dividing the market cap: $2,762.8m by my share count of 462m shares gives you a stock price of $5.98

I think difference is due to slight differences in the sources of information (and basis of calculation) and also the slight error in your working with the addition of net debt, rather than deduction to get from enterprise value to market cap.

Halo Collective operates as a cannabis cultivation, manufacturing and distribution company that grows, extracts and processes cannabis flower, oils and concentrates and also offers edible products in California and Oregon. It serves LICENSED RETAILERS and WHOLESALERS.

**reasons why I invested** 

1. **SALES ARE HELLA INCREASING!** While the Oregon market grew 38% from 2019 to 2020, Halo Collective performed better than the market average. The company's Hush branded products were **ranked fourth among the best-selling brands in Oregon** with total retail sales of $ 21 million. This corresponds to a sales **growth of 228%** over the course of the year and **more than twice the sales growth of the ten top brands in Oregon between 2019 and 2020.** BDSA reported strong growth in flower categories for Halo Collective brands such as pre-rolls, infused pre-rolls and packaged buds. **Sales of hush pre-rolls in 2020 increased by a significant 6,066 percent compared to 2019.** Hush closed 2020 with the best-selling infused pre-roll item in both volume and dollar sales in December 2020. Also of note is Hush's significant **overall flower retail growth, which was $ 3.47 million, up 646 percent year over year**. Hush came up with the **best-selling strain in Oregon in 2020** \- Purple Hindu Kush - in terms of both dollar sales and volume.
2. **THEY ARE EXPANDING FAST!** As part of its continued expansion and vertical integration in the US, Halo has multiple grow operations in Oregon and California. In Oregon, the company has a total of seven acres of field crops, including East Evans Creek, a six acre growing area in Jackson County, and Winberry Farms, a one acre growing area in Lane County. In California, the company is expanding Ukiah Ventures, **a planned 30,000 square foot indoor growing**, processing and manufacturing facility, including up to five acres of additional industrial space for expansion. Halo has also **partnered with GMH to acquire Bar X Ranch in Lake County, California, with plans to develop up to 80 acres of acreage, which would be the largest in Northern California.** On an **international** level, the company is currently growing cannabis at Bophelo Bioscience & Wellness (Pty) Ltd (Bophelo) in Lesotho, **South Africa**; this company has one of the most extensive marijuana cultivation licenses in Africa with a future capacity of up to 495 acres (approximately 200 hectares). To expand Halo's global presence, the company recently acquired an import and distribution license for cannabis products for medical use (CBPM) in the **UK** through cannabis supplier Canmart Ltd. Halo anticipates that Bophelo's growing and manufacturing facilities, combined with Canmart's import and distribution expertise, will be a growth driver for a well-positioned business serving the UK market.
3. **STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP WITH HIGH TIDE Inc and OG DNA GENETICS!** If you know about the cannabis stock market maybe you already know about high tide (0.7$) and its potential. So Halos price atm is a lot lower while they are (in my eyes) the better company 
4. **OPENED A FLAGSHIP STORE IN CALI YESTERDAY, PARTNERSHIP WITH G-EAZY! and signed two new license contracts** this is self explaining.. G-Eazy is a big artist - Kids love big artists - They buy what big artists sell

I mean, couldn't the cycle be: DD gets posted > people don't want to do their DD since that takes time and they fear missing the boat > stock goes up due to Reddit demand ?

It seems the winner strategy here is first buy an unknown penny stock, then post DD, then sell.

It leaves me pretty confused, either this subreddit nails it or it causes those price spikes.

The facts could be absolute nonsense but if there are cool graphs and well formatted catchy paragraphs about the company's executive board, people will start chiming in that they bought a couple hundred/thousand shares.  If you consider the amount of people who look at these posts without a reddit account, hedge fund algos scanning these subreddits for retail sentiment, Youtube/Stocktwits touts, and P&D syndicate buying = noticeable stock movement.

I bought a bunch of penny stocks in early January after doing very basic DD and following these subreddits.  If I had simply held onto them for one month, my entire portfolio would be up 40%.

One thing I have noticed about this subreddit is there is a lot of DD that appears to be well written with these long posts outlining everything you might want to know, but then there are no links to support what they're saying. It's like why even bother?

I appreciate the lead. I'll go do my homework now, but if you're going to write up a DD and post it at least cite sources as you go.

At the end of the day a lot of those accounts are relatively new(less than 6 months) and gain a lot of traction real quick with almost no opposing opinions.

Very scary to imagine people are actually blindly following those posts.

I’m pretty convinced that there are some people here with multiple accounts who just buy random shitty stocks and then write DD posts with their accounts to try and pump them.

415,BB," It doesn't mean it's a pump though. I look at pump and dumps as dodgy stocks that you use to 'pump and dump'.

However, the company could be completely legit, genuine long term company, but you might still want to pump it up a bit and help it out. 

If you don't have enough karma, you might ask someone to post it, but it doesn't necessarily mean the stock itself is shit.

The stock might be perfectly okay.

It's kinda like how BB is actually a decent stock, but it got thrown into the mix with all the meme stuff.

461,IMO," I worked in film production before COVID.  Just because a movie isn't a good piece of art does not mean it isn't a good piece of business.  These shitty low budget movies cost peanuts to make.  Scifi and horror are genres known for being able to print money with low budgets.  They are very safe genres when it comes to generating returns.  This is why you see people make their feature directorial debuts so often with a horror film, its the easiest type of feature directing gig to get.

They also appear to have at least one faith based film (this is the term for Christian genre pieces).  This is a very good sign IMO.  While the genre does not appeal to me, it is an extremely lucrative one.  There is a huge built in audience of evangelical Christians.  The audience of these movies is great for making money off of.   The most important things about the movie are that it has a strong Christian message and themes, and has at least 1 bankable cast member.  Things like poor craftspersonship, poor writing, poor acting, etc are often overlooked by the audiences because the message and themes are what they really care about.  This means you can make a shitty movie on the cheap and the money printer will still go brrrr.  The worst movie I worked on in my life was a faith based film.  The acting was not good (there were some enjoyable moments), the script was trash, the cinematography was bad, the production value was very poor, and the whole shoot was done on a budget of about 35k USD.  This is also one of the few movies that I have worked on that got a distribution deal.  The director/EP who put up every dollar for the project made all his money back. 

The movies I am seeing in Cinedigms portfolio are *cheap* to make.  You could make these movies on a shooting budget of 100-250k.",ElFamosoChinoAntrax,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/lg2olc/cidm_cinedigm_huge_expansions_upcoming_catalysts/gmqbw9m/,0.141,0.764,0.094,-0.9455

Their website and all subsidiary websites are stylish, but not very polished. It appears most of their brands are medical/pharma, but they have two consumer brands (HolyWeed, cbdetc).

HolyWeed seems to be a legitimate business, with high reviews on Google (can't read French though) for very expensive/high end looking cannabis products.

~~CBDEtc appears to be a brick and mortar store in KY, with facebook/yelp/google pages that are actively maintained. According to Facebook, CBDEtc is moving their physical store (reason is unclear).

I will keep updating more bullish points on here

- They own 7 Subsidiaries [you can see here on their website ](https://mpxinternationalcorp.com/core-brands/) Each one of those subsidiaries operates either in Canada/US or internationally or both.

- Currently in 7 countries/4 continents, as listed above in post. 

- one of their subsidiaries “HolyWeed” is exporting to Belgium, Germany 🇩🇪 

- [Britain’s Centre For Medicinal Cannabis Announces MPXOF Subsidiary, Salus Biopharma as Founding Member](https://mpxinternationalcorp.com/media/)

- MPXOF Alberta, a fully owned subsidiary of MPXOF, acquired all of the assets of “Blaze 420 Today Inc”.

- Despite the global COVID-19 pandemic, Holyworld (“Holyworld”), a wholly owned subsidiary of MPXOF, has experienced a strong year in 2020. The team has overcome many challenges presented by COVID-19

- MPX Australia will focus on producing high quality products for the domestic market, and potentially future export to Oceania and the Asia-Pacific region❗️. According to the Australian Government Department of Health's latest data, the number of patients in Australia is growing steadily, with almost 3,000 new patients prescribed medicinal cannabis in the month",Masternewworldorder,5,/r/pennystocks/comments/lfvgy6/mpxof_mpx_international_dd_info_crazy_potential/gmobarm/,0.0,0.945,0.055,0.743
477,MPX," It appears that 1 year ago their US-based assets were purchased by a company called iAnthem, and their international assets were spun off into mpx international (which is managed by the original team). Does this mean that it is less likely for MPX to re-enter the US market (genuine question, I have no idea how these business deals work)?

My main question then would be regarding catalysts, as MTX International seems to have very limited exposure to the US market (and would thus not benefit greatly from decriminalization in the US).

Of the brands listed on their website, 4 subsidiaries (retailers) of CBDETC are based on the US, and none of the medical/pharma subsidiaries of MPX have strong US exposure.

Halo Collective operates as a cannabis cultivation, manufacturing and distribution company that grows, extracts and processes cannabis flower, oils and concentrates and also offers edible products in California and Oregon. It serves LICENSED RETAILERS and WHOLESALERS.

**reasons why I invested** 

1. **SALES ARE HELLA INCREASING!** While the Oregon market grew 38% from 2019 to 2020, Halo Collective performed better than the market average. The company's Hush branded products were **ranked fourth among the best-selling brands in Oregon** with total retail sales of $ 21 million. This corresponds to a sales **growth of 228%** over the course of the year and **more than twice the sales growth of the ten top brands in Oregon between 2019 and 2020.** BDSA reported strong growth in flower categories for Halo Collective brands such as pre-rolls, infused pre-rolls and packaged buds. **Sales of hush pre-rolls in 2020 increased by a significant 6,066 percent compared to 2019.** Hush closed 2020 with the best-selling infused pre-roll item in both volume and dollar sales in December 2020. Also of note is Hush's significant **overall flower retail growth, which was $ 3.47 million, up 646 percent year over year**. Hush came up with the **best-selling strain in Oregon in 2020** \- Purple Hindu Kush - in terms of both dollar sales and volume.
2. **THEY ARE EXPANDING FAST!** As part of its continued expansion and vertical integration in the US, Halo has multiple grow operations in Oregon and California. In Oregon, the company has a total of seven acres of field crops, including East Evans Creek, a six acre growing area in Jackson County, and Winberry Farms, a one acre growing area in Lane County. In California, the company is expanding Ukiah Ventures, **a planned 30,000 square foot indoor growing**, processing and manufacturing facility, including up to five acres of additional industrial space for expansion. Halo has also **partnered with GMH to acquire Bar X Ranch in Lake County, California, with plans to develop up to 80 acres of acreage, which would be the largest in Northern California.** On an **international** level, the company is currently growing cannabis at Bophelo Bioscience & Wellness (Pty) Ltd (Bophelo) in Lesotho, **South Africa**; this company has one of the most extensive marijuana cultivation licenses in Africa with a future capacity of up to 495 acres (approximately 200 hectares). To expand Halo's global presence, the company recently acquired an import and distribution license for cannabis products for medical use (CBPM) in the **UK** through cannabis supplier Canmart Ltd. Halo anticipates that Bophelo's growing and manufacturing facilities, combined with Canmart's import and distribution expertise, will be a growth driver for a well-positioned business serving the UK market.
3. **STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP WITH HIGH TIDE Inc and OG DNA GENETICS!** 
4. **OPENED A FLAGSHIP STORE IN CALI YESTERDAY, PARTNERSHIP WITH G-EAZY! and signed two new license contracts**

495,MPX," My apologies, see the edited post above.

In other words, the subsidiary has their website, and CBDETC has a separate (out of date) webpage. I manually went through each brand owned by CBDETC and found their ""actual"" webpage (validated by comparing product photos between CBDETC website and the brand website)

&#x200B;

I looked through all of the subsidiaries of CDBETC - most seem like small businesses aimed at some particular niche within the CBD market. Of these, most are located in UK or USA, though some of them have no address or no website. I supposed those brands are mostly handling business through the internet.

&#x200B;

All of these brands seem small, but I see no glaring issues with any of them.

739,BB," It’s a real and solid product. There’s no denying that. The two posts that warned of this stock were valid in that it provided a customer perspective where there were the negative reviews and the quality of the device itself. It’s like an Apple earphones versus the Chinese knockoffs you can buy on eBay. For me, I get the knockoffs because they’re cheaper but they break more easily and with Apple, it still does the same thing but it lasts just a bit longer and costs more expensive. There’s apparently only one other competitor against this company (at least based on the DDs) so people are going to make the choices between something more expensive or this product. 

I do agree it’s more of a P&D but it shouldn’t detract that it’s an actual product. BOTY, now that’s a P&D. Just look at today where once it reached $1, it dropped. There are people who hype shares because they do see value and there are those who hype the same to drive the price faster which sucks because it makes people less confident in the company once it dips (good example being BB for blackberry—a solid investment but considered a meme)",waitmyhonor,3,/r/pennystocks/comments/lfxn6l/daily_plays_february_09_2021/gmpncne/,0.049,0.842,0.109,0.9127

744,AI," No problem mate, market is always somewhat rough when you buy in, but to be honest you just need to see when sentiment around a stock changes. That's usually when you should sell if you want to play it safe. Again, sure that might mean your profit is ""only"" 30%, and the next day it would have been 50-70% or even more, but the downside of a gamble at such a time is looking at a sell off and -60% instead of a 30% profit.

If you are looking for a future train but are willing to hold for a while, then take a look at CLWD. I posted on it before so you can go on my profile, filter for posts and search filter for CLWD. I have to warn you that this company was shady in the past. 2002 and 2004 they did a P&D and the executives involved got convicted.

The reasons I am in long is the following:

1) They have an amazing concept which deals with the advertising market, which is currently barely touched besides SEO - and SEO sucks, but it's the best a company can go for that wants to opimize their ads. CLWD instead uses their SWARM technology and added an AI layer to automate the process and learn, and already has shown major success at such an early stage

2) Their progress was insanely fast. They called the project 5th of Jan, went live 3 weeks later and had 4 customers, one of which is apparently CAT and another is a big B2B player

3) Even if they go for another P&D, which I would be surprised with, the last 2 times they managed to get the stock price to 18$ both times. You might see why I don't care about that scenario. It's right now around 0.1$, if that goes to 18$ and then collapses, I will still make a profit in the millions, even if I am slow and only sell at 15$

As said, read up on it and clarify for yourself what you are willing to risk (not as in how much money to put in, but if you would put money into such a play in the first place because it is indeed risky) and then find a proper time to buy. If you are in long, you don't care if you buy at 0.1 or 0.08. The stock usually sees a dip for days after good news and I think a big part of that is due to it's initial run up from 0.0065 to 0.2, which probably left a ton of bag holders that try to get out, or of course a decent amount of day traders. But once this settles I expect it to behave like most other stocks and stabilize.",oodex,29,/r/pennystocks/comments/lfxn6l/daily_plays_february_09_2021/gmon1m6/,0.048,0.832,0.12,0.9913

1) They have an amazing concept which deals with the advertising market, which is currently barely touched besides SEO - and SEO sucks, but it's the best a company can go for that wants to opimize their ads. CLWD instead uses their SWARM technology and added an AI layer to automate the process and learn, and already has shown major success at such an early stage

2) Their progress was insanely fast. They called the project 5th of Jan, went live 3 weeks later and had 4 customers, one of which is apparently CAT and another is a big B2B player

3) Even if they go for another P&D, which I would be surprised with, the last 2 times they managed to get the stock price to 18$ both times. You might see why I don't care about that scenario. It's right now around 0.1$, if that goes to 18$ and then collapses, I will still make a profit in the millions, even if I am slow and only sell at 15$

As said, read up on it and clarify for yourself what you are willing to risk (not as in how much money to put in, but if you would put money into such a play in the first place because it is indeed risky) and then find a proper time to buy. If you are in long, you don't care if you buy at 0.1 or 0.08. The stock usually sees a dip for days after good news and I think a big part of that is due to it's initial run up from 0.0065 to 0.2, which probably left a ton of bag holders that try to get out, or of course a decent amount of day traders. But once this settles I expect it to behave like most other stocks and stabilize.",oodex,29,/r/pennystocks/comments/lfxn6l/daily_plays_february_09_2021/gmon1m6/,0.048,0.832,0.12,0.9913

Did some more digging on this company and wanted to share some insight.

https://www.ecori.org/composting/2020/5/28/medical-waste-developer-implicated-in-price-gouging-accusation

This article popped up when searching for information on the CEO (whose name sounded familiar to me). There are a number of concerning things in the article, but knowing how the State of RI works politically, would lead me away from this company.

The involvement of Justine Caldwell is also particularly important. Politically in RI there has been a broader shift towards “progressive” candidates, Justine Caldwell being one of the more public progressives. While I disagree with their policies, the progressives have been very good at rallying support for/against their causes. It looks like stopping this facility is one of them.

Additionally, the last 10-K stated that if Medrecycler RI fails, the company will likely be insolvent.

At this point, it looks like SNPW is headed towards insolvency if their only hope is a waste to energy facility in RI which faces severe public objection lead by a very vocal progressive politician.",Objective_Kitchen_94,3,/r/pennystocks/comments/lg0o3o/snpw_and_their_endless_potential/gmq1jxd/,0.085,0.778,0.138,0.8454

812,DD," But that was 70% over a year  so that is steady growth.  But as to how to get over that hump is up to you. You can be happy with small growth, there is nothing wrong with that. But now that your up 70% you have to look at it like your playing with house money. They gave you an interest free loan it can sit there or you can have that money make you money.  

I’m not saying YOLO at everything but  you have an example of what your decision making can do, trust it. You got up 70%, I’m you didn’t cheat, you didn’t steal it, you did your own DD and made your own decisions.  That should be very reassuring to you. 

And biggest thing to help when it comes to bigger money is diversify your portfolio. A stocks you have can do down 10% in a day and if you YOLO it, all in on that one stock it’s gonna hurt.

But if your invested in multiple places that -10% can be offset by the three stocks you have that went up 4-7%If your portfolio is balanced you would still see that desired % increase. 

Yeah you won’t see the huge gains you could have had if you YOLO in the stock that gains 100% but if one of your 3 or 4 stocks rockets 100%  your still gonna see a 25-33% increase which is huge.

What would the logic be if you just dropped $10 into a ton of different penny stocks. If any of them hit big you're still bound to make good gains, and if you lose you're only out $10 on each one.

I get the fact that YOLOing 20k on one penny stock is a bad idea but smaller positions in more stocks seems like it makes sense as long as you do your DD.",JRod327,4,/r/pennystocks/comments/lfui8e/the_lounge_thoughts_noob_stuff_low_effort_brokers/gmpo12x/,0.108,0.718,0.174,0.8986

$NAKD at a $2.45 average, leaving me down about 53%

Hi Everyone,

I made a DD on Zenabis Global. Please check out my presentation.

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gnCGVGCu8mzzpcymeNuIBwokHDbsj_vC/view?usp=sharing

This company has good fundamentals for further growth and is really undervalued in my opinion.

This is a long term hold and no pump/dump.

What are your thoughts?

This has been pulling back for a couple days Recently issued 16m shares @ $4.45 I believe that is still open, hence the downward pressure. 

The fact it the stock did not tank, and has estimates from $24 to $35 from 7 analysts, and all rate stock as a buy is pretty grear news.

 This will moon eventually, but with all biotec, it is an unknown when the surge will occur.  The 300-500% upside makes this a no brainer.

1014,GTE," I just made this comment on another thread. Repasting here since I’m in my phone. Also a geologist and I agree with your eoy range. 

Nice dd. I’m trying to dig into the reason it was dropped in 2014-2015. The share value went from $8.12-2.14. The average Brent was $99 then dropped to $52 a barrel in that time. They closed a few reservoirs. Brent dropped to $43 in 2016; rose to $71 in 2018. GTE share value rose to $3.82 but then had been plummeting since. 

They had equipment failures in 2019 which impacted production. They returned $38 million to shareholders during 2019 through the repurchase of 20 million common shares. 

So it’s reasonable to think as things return to normal and the price of oil increases, I think we’re looking at $2.4-3.82 range per shares per 2018-2017 Brent optimistically. That’s assuming they start producing what they shut down and resume the expansion. 

Which looking at 2020: 22,624 barrels oil produce a day bopd; During January 1-25, 2021: 23,428 bopd they are definitely ramping up. 2018 had 36,209 Bopd.

1019,ARDS," Summer this year was interesting for Citius because they are working on a treatment for ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome, which is what happens when people get COVID), and it prompted a lot of interest in the stock that quickly dissolved because the time frame for their ARDS treatment is really several years away. That was what lots of the action and volume in the summer was about. Other than that the ups and downs have mostly been due to delays outside of Citius’ control. The pandemic caused the Mino-Lok trial process to slow down for several months, and that is really the main focus for 2021. Mino-Lok seems to be about as near a 100% hit as is possible with the FDA based on the last few updates they have given (also the fast track program which indicates the need and efficacy), and Citius will then have a product which will bring in peak revenues of $500 million a year. Not to mention they will have extended exclusivity that will last 10-13 years. Essentially, the run has yet to begin simply because of COVID, but everything now points to the trial ending by April. Similar to the ARDS treatment, there are also several promising products in the pipeline but are several years out.",Samurai_Chris,5,/r/pennystocks/comments/lfq3oq/ctxr_my_next_play_looks_primed_to_run/gmnbd4v/,0.01,0.955,0.034,0.6369

I just did a little research myself on Phexxi and the two major downsides I can see:

* Like you mentioned, the price per dose of around $22 - $23. Might be reduced in the future by Medicaid
* Each dose has to be applied immediately (or within one hour) before each episode of vaginal intercourse. This can quickly get costly

Some more information on the FDA testing can be found here (e.g. 18% of the participants experienced a  Vulvovaginal Burning Sensation):

1040,USA," I think the margins are even lower than that for a casino, the house only wins at \~51-55% against the best blackjack players. And if you play roulette, doubling your bet always on the same colour you would win if it weren't for green zero. This gives them about a 2-3% edge against the lowest variance player strategy. (4-6% edge in USA where they have 00 as well as 0). I've played a lot of low stakes poker and one of the biggest things that can help you is bankroll management, playing with around 100-200 tournament buyins available at any one time and consistently improving your game. You will lose in most of the tournaments you play, but you're increasing the likelihood that your continued 50%+ decisions will net you $ in the long run.

Anyway, the cannabis market has a ways to go before it matures and cannabis research is always unveiling more benefits of targeted application and beneficial uses of cannabis.

CLWD has nothing to do with either, though. And none of there targeted markets have to do with ecommerce in the first place - in fact, all of their customers and the big customers are not ecommerce customers, and that would be an absolute waste to use it for that.

Their selling product is the SWARM solution with the AI layer. The goal with it is to cut ad costs by 50% - any, that is used online. Not ecom, anything that appears online, which is a ginormous market. 

What their SWARM solution does (together with the AI layer) is scanning the market and analyzing who should see their ads and in which ways, which is optimizing ads. It's like taking SEO to a whole new level. And all of their past postings talked exactly about that, how they achieved that up to 20-60% with their new customers.

Instead of pretending you did mean them while you didn't mention anything about their leading technology SWARM - which is the only product the have and the only reason they could be a huge thing in the future, and I am not talking about only a $1 stock, you could just say that it was a mistake.

1189,CEO," I believe the CEO shared a statement very recently in regards to updates for the company. Seemed to be all good news. I skimmed it but it was about a new season of their show recording, they have some events in the works, they have paid off all but one of their debt holders, and are focusing on becoming current. It’s also getting a lot of hype and chatter which is spreading more with the investment craze. Let’s not forget it’s super cheap so getting several thousand shares to ride isn’t a huge investment.

1215,CAN," If I did the calculations correctly, your first sale of TSNP was like 3 mill bro.. How is that not enough to retire on? I don't know ya and I'm happy for ya and hope you CAN retire eventually, but... Even running it through a tax gains capital calculator for my area, even if you sold in less than a year you'd pay maybe half of that in capital gains tax which is a lot but, c'mon, you still make closer to 2 mill in a year.. And can make about that much AGAIN right now if you sold. Unless I'm missin something. Must be an expensive life yer living. lol

If someone gave me 1.5 million tomorrow, I'd be buying a nice modest 200k house with fairly low (5k or less) property taxes and sitting and chilling with the rest of the money for years and years.

If life just rained 3-4 mill on me?

1236,RSI," If a stock gets close to what I consider a price target or I feel I am ready to sell,  I will take a look at the RSI and MACD to see when or if it gets close to oversold (> 80%) as a signal to sell.   I will generally sell in smaller chunks.   10-25% here or there as it goes up or down within the range i'm willing to take profit in.  This goes for when I am selling to buy back my initial investment as well.     If I actually believe in the longer term of a company,  I'll actually try to buy a little more than I need/want,  just so I can sell that back later to get back initial investment.   for instance, OZSC I think can be a longer hold for me,  I'd like to hold on to 30k shares long term, but I managed to squeeze out an extra 5k shares on various dips that I'm willing to try and swing trade with or sell off to help cover init. investment.  


eg.  A few weeks ago, I made a decision that I wasn't planning on holding GAXY long term.  I do have some profit from it, but the movement isn't  what I was expecting, and if I don't see anything within the first 100 days of this new administration I will probably let it go. (been holding since Sept).  My first step is to sell back my investment, so over the past few weeks whenever it's had days over .035  I've looked to sell some.  I've sold 5% of shares at .045 10% at .034 and sold off another 5% today at 0.046.   This should give me a decent average sell rate and in case it does shoot off again,  I'll still have some shares left.    At the end of all this,  I might still hold on to 10-15% of my initial shares just for shits and giggles.

In terms of the product itself and demand for it, the investment in the space indicates some very big brain people have tested the market and are willing to put billions into it (AB InBev - Labatt, Constellation Brands - Canopy Growth, Aphria - Sweet water).
