13,IMO," This chart is true, but very misleading, because the actual dollar value never changes.  Take a look at the last column.  Let‚Äôs say you have $100 invested as 100 shares of a stock valued at one dollar per share.  If the price drops by 90 cents to 10 cents a share, you lose 90% of your investment, or 90 bucks, and only have 10% of your investment, or 10 bucks, left.  In order to get back to where you started, you need to increase the value of your shares by 900% of 10 dollars, or 90 bucks.  This equates to a 90 cent per share increase, or exactly what the loss was in true dollar value in the first place.  In this model, on the way down, every penny you lose is a 1% loss, but every penny you gain is a 10% gain.  Percents are important, but not everything.  Always good to keep an eye on the real dollar value of what your gaining and losing, IMO.",Aeddon1234,11,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/mcmpn8/how_much_gains_it_takes_to_recover_from_market/gs5ghuc/,0.108,0.63,0.262,0.9853

21,GE," There are major issues with Rolls-Royce.  Rolls-Royce clearly butters its bread with aircraft engine sales, so there's the obvious  connection to the fall during the pandemic.  However, that's only the surface.  The pandemic has changed air travel.  While airlines are bring aircraft back into service, what's not coming back as strong is wide-body aircraft.  In fact, [the market for wide-body aircraft is suppressed](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidyu/2020/08/19/the-price-is-right-commercial-aircraft-market-offers-bargains-for-the-bold/?sh=3ba5570225af) because there's such little demand.  The two major engines that RR is producing, the Trent XWB-84 and Trent 1000, are engines produced for wide-body A/C (A350 and 787, respectively).  Now, while those two airframes still have good demand, Rolls-Royce has had numerous issues with both of these engines, causing airlines to reduce orders for the 787 with the Trent 1000, or switch entirely to the GE offering, the GEnx-1B (this is the best selling engine on this airframe).  There's a reason RYCEY is widely considered to still have a negative forecast, as well as why they have a junk credit rating from the S&P Global Ratings.  Now, I can't ever see Britain allowing RR to fail, but this is still a risky investment.",FriendOfPistolPete,11,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/mcynd8/rolls_royce_was_greatly_impacted_from_the_covid/gs6fy0x/,0.047,0.89,0.062,0.4391

25,UK," They're also making small electric planes that would cover both the future of the industry and the smaller plane size issues you mentioned. Albeit there's still a long way to go but they at least show movement in the exact right direction. They are near future focused on fuel engines with lower emissions and just opened an advanced engine testing facility. As others have also stated, the UK wont let RR die if it can help it in general. Unfortunately the UK is a mess right now, air travel is not coming back too soon, and those electric planes won't be a mainstay until well after the pandemic anyway. Near term? Dud.

26,UK," Are they ahead of the curve or behind the curve in the area of small electric planes? Are they ahead of the curve or behind the curve on low emission engines? 

It's all well and good to say they are working on things. All companies are, though. That doesn't tell us much. What matters is whether if/when they eventually go somewhere with those things, will they be getting therefore before the other big players in that market or are they going to be constantly playing catch up. If they are always playing catch up, all those things existing will have no benefit. Dragging behind will just cement their low value or drop it lower. That's how pricing in products works. You don't get participation points for just being there. You have to actually be better than the others in some meaningful way.

And people keep saying the UK won't let them fail. That wouldn't make their value any less consistently bad. It would just mean they would be supported at the low end for a long time.

34,IDRA," Lol. I love low volume options.

IDRA $7calls are worth about 5 cents per share or $5 each contract.

Because there is no volume, when the bids are .05 and the only ask is .75 you get a false market price of .40

But if there's a super high ask, like $1000, your false market price will be astronomical. Like in your screenshot.

Try selling those calls for any crazy price and you can move the market price yourself. But nobody is buying them.

As an example: I have an AGTC $5 call and there is very little volume. So, in the past when I tried to sell at a peak, when I put in my order it would instantly drop the ‚Äúmarket price‚Äù and it wouldn‚Äôt fill.

If it amounts to a permanent, long term or even 6 month reduction in the capital requirements on banks, we will get a bounce. Google SLR exemptions and read the comments from the banks.
