6,DD," 1K shares at what cost basis? Forgive me, I'm always a bit skeptical when someone spams the same DD to multiple subs. Especially for a stock that's plummeted. 

Going through their 10-Q right now. They got some things going for them, some things kinda stinky. The strongest takeaway for me is that they claim they have enough cash runway to get vadadustat to market, but they reaaaally need to get it to market because their cash burn is pretty quick. 

Most concerning thing is the industry moat.. Amgen and J&J already have drugs on the market for years, although vadadustat being oral rather than injectable is a plus. 

Definitely will dig into this more. 

Speculative calls are cheaaaaaaap, so I might shake a stick at it, depending on what else I find. Thx for the heads up!",Itsboomhomie,3,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/nnbl72/akba_350pt_20_nda_acceptance_catalyst_any_day_now/gzu7ww1/,0.039,0.834,0.127,0.9132

11,BHAT," BHAT is an interesting young company. I've done my research, but currently hold no position. The offering was well below market value, hence the plunge. I can't find *who* the tutes that bought the offering was, but the float is pretty low and BHAT doesn't see a lot of volume. 

On paper, BHAT seems undervalued, trading at .5 P/B. If they can keep ripping on revenues, they should be alright. The problem with them being such a young company is that I think more dilution is in their future. Even if the stock rips, the warrants from the last offering are at 1.12/share, which could keep a cap on share price.",Itsboomhomie,1,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/nnb1zq/daily_discussion_thread/gzw9cfv/,0.073,0.787,0.14,0.802
