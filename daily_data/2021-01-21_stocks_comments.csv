0,GME,"Mate, had that too in the first 2 weeks of my life as a new investor. Then I realized I fuck up more if I’m constantly checking the news etc. There are actually studies showing that investors who check their portfolio a couple times a day are making less gains than people checking their portfolio more rarely. That info def helped me curb my addiction.
An example: my dumbass bought GME in september 2020.. sold it after holding it only 2 weeks because I was so anxious that it could hit rock bottom. If I hadn’t checked my phone constantly I would be sitting on a lot of money right now, you can check GME for yourself but probably you already know how it developed recently",0.053,0.933,0.013,-0.5865
1,GME,"I get what you are saying.  For me, I view it as a game.  There is the grind of researching and putting in your time.  There is clear rewards and consequences for losing the game.  It makes sense why people are addicted to stocks especially when one considers how easy it is to trade now.

You get the dopamine hit from guessing right, and the 'game' can distract/mute stress and negative emotions.

Many of us have gone through periods of time like that. (it's 6:30am eastern and I'm up reading this subreddit...perhaps I have a problem too).

Grow into some buy & hold investments. VTI, VGT, ARKK, ARKG, ICLN. You can buy those and not pay attention for a while and still enjoy growth when the market is going up. Be able to be present when spending time with other people. And for the long-term (aka your retirement fund) you likely don't want to be churning into various etf's and stocks every week.

I've lost 25-30k€ in my early years sports betting, before starting to become profitable.  I keep thinking and thinking and thinking about where I'd be right now if I'd have started in the stockmarket and invested all that money. But on the other hand, I've learned so much and maybe I would've never ended up in the stockmarket if I didn't go that path. 
I can't describe the feeling of discovering the stockmarket. It's not only an addiction for me, it gave me a new life. I honestly don't know where I would've ended up with a gambling addiction. The stockmarket is no gambling. It's one of the only positive addictions. You get a reward for countless hours or research. You get a reward for all the money and effort you put in. The stockmarket is LIFE. Like a mirror. You get back what you give.
 I spent almost 12 hours a day for 7 years in the sportsbetting industry, to lose a shitload of money and time, just to discover that it's almost impossible to earn money in the long run.

I also work in tech, and keep up on this stuff regularly. I came across info on their new Zen platform coming out. I figured with intel being stagnant, AMD had a chance to get back some market share. 

When it hit $12 the next year, I started seeing a lot more AMD talk. And then it traded up and down in the $12-$15 range for a while. (I remember all the memes of AMD being free money, buy at $12, sell at $15, rinse and repeat).

Now, I certainly can't say I expected them to hit $90, but it's crazy to see how far it's come in 5 years since I bought in.

Same thing will happen to Tesla and NIO. Doesn't mater if Nio doesn't, if ever, go into the lower price car market.

This goes beyond supply and demand. Stocks can move up and down at any given second without high bids or sale demands.

Dollar-cost-average. Not just when the stock is going up, but also when the stock is going down (especially then). Timing the market usually never works the way you want it to and time in the market is scientifically proven to be more rewarding.

361,GEVO,"It sounds like you’re looking to learn how to get a little footing in order to value a company. 

There is technical analysis where you look at chart moving averages, talk about resistance and breakthroughs and other concepts which get fairly complex but mainly focus on the chart. You’ve mentioned a few purely chart aspects so you seem a little aligned with this view.

Also I would much more recommend learning to read a balance sheet. This is typically honest and audited information and when you look at a series of quarters or full years you get a good underlying sense of many things. Obviously revenue, but are they operating more efficiently to retain profit, depending on the company are they investing in R&D? Is payroll expanding or contracting. Are the accumulating or losing cash? Is that cash just coming from debt? Are they issuing more shares which diluted the stock value to get cash? I looked at GEVO a tiny biofuel company and you’ll see they recently have no income, payroll is down, available product inventory is high, and they have no intermediate product- so they’ve shut down, and they said so, no surprise, but operating costs whether producing or not are clearly $5-6M each quarter so now I have a sense of how long they can go before they’re broke. You may also take these deciphered aspects from the balance sheet and compare to similar companies to see more of how the one in question is and has been doing. I much prefer the information here vs chart technical analysis.

Another simpler and bigger simple reality is that retail investors are a much higher presence, I think I read 30% of volume opposed to 10% a couple years ago. This may be responsible for a huge run up in both “famous” companies like popular tech stocks, but also little previously overlooked stocks like GEVO. People are looking to invest for big returns against big odds. If enough people do this then by golly the stock price shoots up and it begins to actually friggin work. When I looked at GEVO last week they had 10 quarters of cash b4 bust. They flew up multiples in stock price lately, likely because Biden’s tech secretary was cofounder decades ago and green is big. This is naive investing BUT, you know what GEVO did?! They issued more shares at this extremely higher price and now have $350M in the bank, plenty of runway and enough to fund new facility expansion. It actually friggin worked.

So individual investor people are more simple and naive on average, so the money follows publicized events and news themes more than it has. It’s important to consider this new phenomena.

But the other involves the company itself (and is the reason for the squeeze). The stock price went down because brick and mortars in general were failing, and GME as a result became undervalued (by fundamentals, it should be $140-$180, today). Then one of the co-founders of [Chewy.com](https://Chewy.com) joined forces with Gamestop, Microsoft entered into a multi-year revenue sharing deal with GME, and the company is trying to pivot from brick and mortar into the gaming version of [Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com). They have some other innovations as well.

So, what will the stock do after the squeeze? impossible to say, but there is sentiment suggesting to hold long because of the potential growth in that gaming sector. Sure, you could trade the squeeze and deal with short term capital gains taxes, or hold long if you believe the company really is going to explode as well.",0.012,0.9,0.088,0.9081

Any DD on converting what is today raw land into a full-blown productive oil field needs to include information on the governments. There’s about a 100% chance that a chunk of the population, with the backing of international preservation groups, will be fighting against this activity. What sort of political headwinds do they face from the governments of Namibia and Botswana? How effectively do the governments of those nations even control the area? What are the other geopolitical factors in play unique to the specific parts in question in these countries?

All this stuff has to play out before the first drop of crude can come out of the ground. That takes time.

COVID vaccines have been estimated to last in efficacy between 18 months and 36 months which means we are going to need them for a long time.

Normally wouldn’t suggest against diversifying but only doing here because doing some research on your own and choosing one stock may be a better for initial returns and a good way to get in the habit of not falling too in love with a stock for someone with less than 25k (less restrictions on trading after this benchmark, like having the option to day-trade when we ever get into a bearish period). 

Also if the market crashes at any point, you‘ll most likely lose money on a diversified portfolio anyways as well as going all in one 1 stock, and also average down your top performer. 

DO NOT put it on penny stocks or options until you’ve built out your portfolio.

For example you can automatically set it so $200 goes to your account each month for you to buy stocks, or however much you can afford to invest.",0.016,0.898,0.086,0.8399

718,TV,"In Europe in many countries every streaming service is expensive, many are not availablr and you have to pay mandatory fees for public television in many countries (if owning a TV). Netflix (+DAZN if you like Sports) is the best choice to replace public TV, so the savings of public television fees add to it's benefits. Also, for some content it is the only alternative here to expensive specialized services and especially the *only* decent alternative for casual watchers of such media. For example, K-Dramas and Anime. You either buy a service as expensive as Netflix just for this, or get a reasonable amount included in Netflix already. 

I can tell you that all students at my university have Netflix, because it is unbeatable. With account-shating you have a full TV replacement inc. Asian stuff for eff.5€ AND can deactivate your TV cable saving you ~15€/month. Netflix + YT (+Dazn) IS TV now for everyone below 30. Noone cares about Disney+ or AppleTV. Many have Prime Video but that's in part because it is dirt-cheap being bundled with other Prime benefits. If people would need to choose just one streaming service, I am 100% sure the vast majority would favor Netflix.

I am 100% sure Disney and Apple will both grow here as the total streaming market is still expanding, but I expect their growth numbers be underwhelming in Europe for the forseeable future. I think Netflix will absolutely dominate here. Similar to Music Streaming, everyone uses Spotify or rarely Deezer, a few also Apple & Google just because it was pre-installed oj the phone. All others are completely irrelevant. Spotify and YT are becoming more and more the default of music consumption, and Netflix becomes the standard TV replacement.",0.012,0.902,0.086,0.9581

722,USA,"1. The world isn't USA. Also, Netflix's subscriber count continues to grow in the U.S. Market share does not really matter since people can/do sign up for multiple services.
2. As explained many times before, Netflix's average quality is higher than most of the competition. The reason may not think so is because Netflix produces so much content (great value), that you're bound to run into Netflix content that you have no interest in.
3. Reed Hastings says that sports could make sense for Netflix but they won't do it yet. I never said Netflix will do live sports now. Just Hastings acknowledging that live sports could make sense for Netflix proves my point 8 months ago.
4. Well, Netflix literally has the largest catalog of shows amongst any streaming company. If people are bored of Netflix, then they're bored of other streaming services too. Regardless, my point about competition stands: If you only have one streaming service, it's Netflix. If you have two, one of them is Netflix.

Their flu vaccine is also very promising - I've seen price targets in the 300$'s if they capitalize on vaccine and their flu shot gets approvals.

I don't know where you heard their vaccine has a 100% success rate, but I have read from the early trials that the titer response was shown in 100% of occupants (titers is basically a test to show the antibody response) and that the amount was higher than pfizer and moderna.

See [the style box here](https://www.morningstar.com/etfs/bats/gsew/portfolio) versus the large blend -- equal weight will give you very even exposure between large and mid-caps and value/blend/growth by definition.

As you say, this will greatly lower your exposure to the biggest companies like Apple since the exposure rebalances in the ETF to 0.2% per stock. Basically, the strategy is that it sells the best quarterly performers and rebalances to the worst quarterly performers.

As you can see in the holdings, GM is now one of the top holdings since it has been one of the best performers in the S&P500 since the last rebalance. So, on a quarterly basis you are always selling recent positive momentum stocks and buying recent negative stocks.

Is this a strategy you want to use? It will minimize the impact of any individual stock on your portfolio's performance, which will sometimes help and sometimes hurt like when the top stocks continue to outperform. It also doesn't have unlimited capacity to invest like market cap weighting since the market would heavily distort if everyone allocated as much to Xerox as Apple. I'd say it certainly is a strategy worth considering since you can make the rationale for it, but there's no reason that it **has to** outperform the total market index.

If your order was big enough to move the stock up by $1, you’ll see that same price movement when you sell the shares and it will drive your average price down by $1. The only real arbitrage here is the market makers will profit off the bid/ask spread making a few pennies off every share you traded.

Also 1.6M shares isn’t as big as you think it is when looking at a stock like PLUG.  You really don’t see much price movement unless your trade is more than 5% of the average daily volume and if your trade is that large, your broker will hold up the order and either sweep the dark pools or setup the trade to execute over time using a VWAP, TWAP, or percentage of volume algorithm.",0.0,0.904,0.096,0.9042
803,PLUG,"The average share volume for $PLUG is 35 million shares and the recent daily volume is consistently above 50 million shares. 

Just trading 1.5 million wouldn’t do much. That’s less than 0.3% of the market cap and it’s very unlikely all those shares would simultaneously be available to buy or sell. You’d end up waiting a while as the order got turned to pieces and gradually filled.",0.0,0.876,0.124,0.7783
