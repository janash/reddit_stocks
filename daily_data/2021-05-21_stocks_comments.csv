An earlier update on Oct. 23, 2020, added information about a price increase for FSD to $10,000 and that the company had started releasing a significant FSD update to limited owners in ""beta"" form.

64,AI," As a Tesla owner with the FSD package, this statement is ridiculous:

>Its time and energy could be better spent on developing a driver monitoring system for Autopilot to significantly improve the safety and usefulness of that system.

No. Just no. Cameras on the driver isn't going to make their systems ""safer"" or more ""useful"".

For all the situations that FSD is advertised to be used in, and many that it isn't, their systems do an A+ job at both piloting the vehicle and alerting the driver to take over when the AI isn't confident what to do.

Auto-Steer and Traffic-Aware Cruise Control, often referred to together as Autopilot, can't drive _everywhere_, but the number situations they can handle extremely well is impressive. Freeways have been a solved problem for Tesla for years. Lane changes, also solved for freeways and city streets.

65,FSD," As a Tesla owner with the FSD package, this statement is ridiculous:

>Its time and energy could be better spent on developing a driver monitoring system for Autopilot to significantly improve the safety and usefulness of that system.

No. Just no. Cameras on the driver isn't going to make their systems ""safer"" or more ""useful"".

For all the situations that FSD is advertised to be used in, and many that it isn't, their systems do an A+ job at both piloting the vehicle and alerting the driver to take over when the AI isn't confident what to do.

Auto-Steer and Traffic-Aware Cruise Control, often referred to together as Autopilot, can't drive _everywhere_, but the number situations they can handle extremely well is impressive. Freeways have been a solved problem for Tesla for years. Lane changes, also solved for freeways and city streets.

72,AI," >	Cameras on the driver isn't going to make their systems ""safer"" or more ""useful"".

Sure will.

Safer because a car that stops and calls an emergency number when the driver isn’t paying attention to the road will protect the driver and those around him, both in cases of legit issues (sleepiness, health problems) and more critically from the fools who think is fun to abuse the system.

More useful because, lacking this monitoring system and given the frequent abuses, your Autopilot will eventually be made illegal.

Here is the problem: it’s not revolutionary at this time, maybe never will.

The safe part of Tesla assistance systems, the reliable part, the part that’s actually useful, other brands do it as well.

76,FSD," It's a little pedantic, but Tesla is now officially advertising it as ""Full Self Driving Capability"". When I got it, I understood that Enhanced Autopilot or FSD didn't mean that the car wouldn't be able to _fully self-drive_ itself today, but it was expected to do so in the future. If Tesla fails to deliver, I can see how that's a bit of a swindle, but as I've said before I am quite impressed with what has been delivered so far.

I'm sure Elon is very confident in the progress they have made in fully autonomous driving in private lots, but I agree, there are concerns, legal and otherwise, about fully autonomous driving on public roads.

It's speculation, but I from my experience driving his cars, I expect he will deliver, but when exactly, I can't say. I also don't think I'd feel comfortable riding in the backseat without a driver in the next decade, or perhaps ever. Having someone able to intervene in emergency situations is a sensible idea. But also, driving a Tesla is fun. I don't think I'd want to stop co-piloting a Tesla, even if it was safe. Driving is dangerous, but most of the danger comes from all the _other_ drivers in the road. I won't drive a motorcycle for the same reason. Even if I'm an A+ motorcycle driver, it's the less responsible _other_ drivers that may ruin my day.

However, I would feel comfortable driving to an airport and sending my car back home without passengers. Or, going to a theme park and sending my car off to find a parking spot. The car will patently, slowly, and safely drive it self. If there was an accident, it would be a minor fender bender, not a high speed fiery crash.

85,FSD," The point is that, even if you assume self driving systems will eventually be in *some* aspects superior to human drivers, for a safety judgment the comparison is not between human drivers and self driving.

It’s between *human drivers aided by driving assistance systems* and self driving.

The cooperation of a human driver with specific safety-oriented driving assistance systems, like driver fatigue and attention monitoring, emergency braking, blind spot monitoring, set a much higher bar for Self Driving to meet before it can be considered safer than humans.

This combination of human driver and driving aids, with today technology, is the best standard of driving safety. And that’s what responsible car manufacturers are offering and working to improve.

FSD is a bag of hype, it doesn’t currently exists, and going from interviews with people in the field it’s still a long way off.

Suggesting that cars today can drive themselves is irresponsible. It encouraged people to use their cars foolishly. Tesla’s system should be named in a way that’s totally unequivocal on the fact that It’s Not Self Driving.

Selling a car on the promise that someday will be full self driving (remember the nonsense that Tesla cars would become appreciating assets because owners would make money sending them out as robo taxis?) is a scam.
None of the cars on sale today are likely to ever be updated to legally be Full Self Driving.

I'm bullish on the company because there is a very high ceiling of growth and lots of market opportunities open. It has Oprah, Natalie Portman and Jay-Z as investors as well, like em or hate em, if they do any kind of promotion for the company its going to result in big sales.

I see it going to $30 and then down to $12-$15 before it slow climbs again to $20-$25 over a 6 month to 1 year period. Long term, OTLY has a lot of potential and promise.

97,OTLY," They went from $200 million sales in 2019 to $400 million in sales in 2020. One of their biggest markets for growth is the USA. They're already on trajectory to do $550 million in 2021. 

Keep in mind people are traveling less, which results in buying less coffee from shops just look at Starbucks revenue slow down. The lockdowns are a problem for Oatley, whereas things opening up only mean increased sales for Oatley. 

This company could easily be doing over $1 billion annual sales in 3 years time.

Hard for them to enter the developer/publisher market because of that. The last one that did it was Microsoft and they have devoted huge amounts of recourses to do it.

Them trying to enter the platform market will be equally difficult. Epic is trying for a while with moderate success, while also investing so much to it.

* KO products are likely not going away in the next 50 years. 
* KO has a strong worldwide manufacturing and distribution network.
* Lately, they are divesting lower margin operations and turning them over to 3rd parties (bottling). This will increase margins at the cost of rev.
* Generally they grow and adapt by creating or buying new drinks but they generally havent diversified outside of drinks. This not necessarily a bad thing just that they are more cyclical as the pandemic proved.
* Their rev was hit pretty hard by COVID due to restaurant closures. It will likely climb moving forward.
* Historically dividend keep growing and there is little danger in losing it.
* Historically they are a net share buyback company which is also good.
* Total return the last 10 years is about 8.5% annualized.

127,KO," Higher dividend plays make more sense when you have a ton of money you can leave lying around up front. You won't realize any real payoffs until it's generating a sizable dividend and that require a LOT of shares. KO was an amazing buy for someone like Buffet who has seen like a 100X return, but definitely not as appealing nowadays. 

Let's do some quick math as an example. With a yearly dividend of $1.64, 20 shares nets you a quarterly dividend of  $8.20 ($32.80 per year). KO stock is currently hovering around $55 and had an all-time high of $60. There's not going to be a whole lot of growth unless something big changes at Coca-Cola so let's just assume it ping-pongs between $55-58 over a year. You're pretty much gaining only like $60 on the total stock value ($55 to $58 x 20 shares) and $32.80 from dividends. In other words, you're up about $93 after a year on an investment of $1080. 

Earning money is good and all, but I think you could do WAY better by investing that $1080 into something that has higher growth potential long term. If you had the capacity to buy something like 2-3K shares at once now we're talking, but at really low share numbers it's not really worth it. 

If you don't have anything you want to invest in right now it's fine to park money in a dividend stock, but be sure to prioritize whatever makes sense for your investment horizon. As young person getting into it, the idea of dividends is super appealing but the reality is that you need a sizable deposit for it to be worth it.",Karametric,1,/r/stocks/comments/nhpkn0/is_it_worth_it_to_invest_in_multiple_shares_of/gyz3gb6/,0.035,0.759,0.206,0.9947

134,HUGE," Have you done any research at all into it or is that just your biased opinion while you blame “meme” stocks for the recent volatility in the lumber markets, reverse repo rates being 5th highest ever, and the s&p inflation adjusted earnings just hit zero for the first time in 40 years?

135,UK," Let's check out the numbers comparing it to one of the maddest gamblingcountries in the world: UK - a country where online betting is legalizedand they gamble much more than other European countries.47% of Brits have gambled in some way in the last 4 weeks

.On average, Brits spend £2.60 per week on gambling, totaling over £135.20per year. According to Businessfirstonline online gambling accounts for38% of the total gambling market. However that is the total gambling market including casinos, sport betting etc. Exchanging the currency would result in 180$ per person and now the online percentage would bearound $68 per person. In 2015 sports betting made 45% of all online gambling in the UK, so we now have around $30 per person.

The US has around 320 million people. Multiple $30 with 320 and we get 9600 million spend in the US on Online Sports betting.Which would be 9.5 billion for the whole industry in sales. In the UK profit margins are:WilliamHill 4.5% and Playtec is negative but has around 5% operating margins.These have several offline branches as well, so we say 12% is profit which is extremely generous over the long run due to promotions and advertisment Taking the theoretical size of 9.5b of online sports betting and applying 12% (which is very generous) would result in around 1.14b in revenue. Even if it would be double it is still a low number. Average P/E ratio ofInternetB2C betting sites was 15.6 from 1999-2016 according to CreditSuisse, that would result in an industry that should be around 16b for online sports betting.Draftkings is valued at 17bso in terms of online sports betting it is getting bigger than the theoretical industry of mad gambling Brits with US numbers. So while the opportunity seems to be there, the price is already ahead of itself.

&#x200B;

Even if they expand into other sectors it will be hard to justify the valuation as there are no monopolies in online-betting.",RoPrime12,50,/r/stocks/comments/nhnnui/is_draftking_a_big_buy_the_dip_moment/gyx9pxf/,0.051,0.875,0.073,0.87

139,DKNG," DKNG is so much more than a sports gambling company. Their daily fantasy sports business is what separates them from other competitors (besides FanDuel). DraftKings and FanDuel have a massive share of the Daily Fantasy Sports market and that is where they make their money. Many consider DraftKings to be the best platform for this. The sports gambling business is just the cherry on top. I will continue to pay a higher multiple on DKNG (one of only 3 companies I do this for), because the growth is exponential.

147,MD," I'm not a huge fan of comparing the UK and US betting markets, they are very different betting markets. Most estimates I've seen for the current betting handle in the US is somewhere in the range of $180-$250B between legal and illegal bets. On an assumed 6-8% take home that makes total revenue $10.8-$20B in its current structure. This doesn't take into account all of the growth opportunities you mentioned as well as people who want to bet but don't have access/choose not to use illegal sites as. Also, in-venue betting in MD and AZ (already legal is DC and IL) was recently legalized and more states will likely follow suit. Also, while it won't be a monumental amount, Canada is getting closer to single game wagering which will likely add a side pot to revenue.

Also, growth in betting in the US has not slowed. Nevada (an established market for decades) is showing 15% growth from 2019 Q4 to 2020 Q4. New Jersey showed over 50% growth in that same time.

It's difficult to pinpoint where US revenue is eventually going to land but I don't think $9.5B is even in the ballpark. 

Also, wherever margins land is going to be incredibly difficult to predict. William Hill for example got hit hard with branch closures and UK restrictions on kiosk betting even before COVID. DraftKings and most other US entrants are clearly putting a higher emphasis on mobile betting.

I don't disagree with the point of OP that DraftKings is aggressively valued, it is. But I think that there is justification behind it.",DevilsBrew23,2,/r/stocks/comments/nhnnui/is_draftking_a_big_buy_the_dip_moment/gyygxhe/,0.074,0.823,0.103,0.7553

When the NFT sells, the get the money on the front side, but also 6% everytime they're resold for perpetuity. The play really depends on the longevity of NFT values.

362,BABA," In my opinion the risks and sentiment is overblown (and thus BABA is undervalued) for a number of reasons: 

Recency bias - everyone is angry/untrusting of China post covid which will be forgotten in time 

Risk of de-listing -  this doesn’t happen very often and is unlikely to happen when you consider that China is trying to *encourage* and not discourage FDI 

Nationalisation by Chinese government - Again it is unlikely that China’s government will forcefully takeover and de-rail one of the Crown Jewels of Chinese business 

ADR and lack of genuine ownership - Munger and Pabrai don’t seem to care, furthermore China is trying to become a more reputable nation. If they dishonour the ADR they will be criticised on a global scale. 

Recent earnings - were negative, however when taking account for the 2.8 billion fine they grew on almost all business metrics.

378,TSLA," 1. You own ARKK and are also short ARKK? Any logical reason for this? It would be more efficient for you to just cancel out the long with the short rather than have both.

3. Could you remain fully solvent if QQQ has a drawdown of 50% and ARKK / TSLA crash 80% from this point?
4. Options paying your bills? You realize this makes money only if you continue to have the collateral? Like I said, what do you do when you go in the money?

My honest advice: Liquidate everything and reconsider everything you learned and who you learned it from. I hope this is money that you can afford to lose.

In fact, I looked through your previous posts since I'm in complete shock and it seems that you cannot actually afford to cover the put without margin? How much margin would you go into (paying it off fully with your net worth) if all your puts get assigned?

LMT is the largest defense company and makes some of the best military tech you can buy.

It does not hurt that although Trump is the only President in years who did not start a war, most of Washington, including the current administration, is firmly against that sort of isolationism.  They want the U.S. to be throwing its weight around the world.

The result is that only the rich can buy ethically and this limits any growth.

425,ICE," Not untill we phase out all ICE,  stop using plastic, and oil based chemical. It will take another 30-40years before we can do that. The simplest term is, how often do you see a electric car? Or do you have one?

426,XOM," Most of the major players peaked in 2014 and have been trending downward since. Alternatives are only getting cheaper, more efficient, and more accessible.

However, prices haven't hit pre-pandemic levels and demand is likely to increase in the short term as reopening reignites travel and shipping, and they typically have strong dividend payments.

Long term I would call it a losing bet (10 years ago, XOM was the biggest company by market cap, now it's not even top 10), but there's still money to be made.",Asinus_Sum,5,/r/stocks/comments/nhbxm2/oil_and_gas_stocks_on_their_way_out/gyvhdni/,0.049,0.884,0.066,0.3613

TOT and BP have already laid out plans to push toward green energy initiatives over the coming decades. US oil companies will have no choice to follow or they will eventually disappear. But even if the latter happens, it will be decades before they would cease operations (and I personally don't think they'll ever go anywhere - they'll just move into different areas).",NativeTxn7,1,/r/stocks/comments/nhbxm2/oil_and_gas_stocks_on_their_way_out/gywnvsx/,0.028,0.957,0.014,-0.128
