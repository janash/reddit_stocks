Or look at their university system.  They have added more than 380 universities in the last decade, an increase of nearly 17%.

I also speak the language, so that helps a lot. 

Xi is a dictator, but the Chinese people aren't stupid. There is a social contract here, and the Chinese people support him as long as that social contract is not broken. 

Furthermore, Xi is not only concerned about holding on to power. He wants to cement his legacy and is playing a civilizational game. Part of this civilizational game is to propel China as a, if not THE, dominant power in the world. There are many facets to this game, from being a financial juggernaut and attract investors to have skin in his game, to building soft power through other means.

His existing political position, support from his party and the people, and his civilizational goal are very intimately intertwined. If one unravels, the others will very quickly unwind too. That's why BABA received a large fine that would hurt and get the point across, but not lead to irreversible damage.

1. what do you base your strategy on?
2. have these assumptions changed?
3. If they have, what did your strategy told you to do.
4. What is plan b.

With a defined strategy, you can rely on it.

I'll give you an example.

Let's say you study the staple product industry.

Assumption 1. Cocacola, nestle, pepsi are similar and should react to the business cycle in a similar fashion. Which mean that if 1 is down, all 3 should be down and vice versa.

Assumption 2. Run a linear regression on historical data to find the correlation on 1 year, 5 years, 10 years, 20 years + bonus linear regression on 2 different financial crash such as covid, 2008. Look at their coefficient of correlation. That mean if 1 rise in price, in theory (not in practice, but in theory), they other should follow to a ratio of one of your many coefficient of correlation. You can look at macro economic indicators to identify which coefficient makes the most sense.

Assumption 3. Your look at their Earning per shares and their dividend interest rate and you compare their mobile means on 3 days, 10 days, 90 days.

Then, when one of these 3 company goes further down than the other 2, you buy it. 

When that same company goes above the mobile mean 90 days, you sell and you buy the next lower one and you keep rotating.

&#x200B;

This is a strategy. It isn't the most efficient, you could add covered call to the mix or look at different indicator, but it's a strategy. 

This means that as long as your assumption hold, if there's day trading of the market and it goes down hard, it is part of your strategy. So you let the strategy take the decisions and you can sleep in peace.

If you are investing in random stock without a strategy with solid assumptions, you are gambling. 

That strategy could be based on fondamental of a company or it's ability to pay dividend and to make profits like in tabacco stock.

But you need a strategy.

I have multiple strategy which I follow to have a certain level of diversification even though I own less than 20 stock at a time. But each of those stock follow either a specific strategy or are based on fundamental and value play.

If my BTI stock goes down by 4 $, it just mean the dividend rate is now higher and my reinvestment rate is now higher. It doesn't affect me at all and since I have many other strategy, when one is in the red a little, I usually have the two third of my investment in the green. This year, I'm at 41% in the green.

If you don't know how to read fundamental or how to do linear regression, then learn how to or go boggle head investing into index fund.

It feels insanely undervalued, actually, and yes, the stock split could help with that, because it would reduce the risk/impact of potential anti-trust probes, and the sum of parts could be much bigger than the whole. Each of Amazon’s businesses is blowing away most of the competition and the news/stats you hear about Amazon every day is just fascinating. And yet, the stock doesn’t move, yet.

169,BIG," Use this current consolidation to keep adding before it pops.

Amazon hit a previous peak back in July 2018 and then basically tracked sideways until Covid hit last year. So basically all its gains in a 2-year period from July 2018 to July 2020 came in the very last 4 months. That's over a year and a half of sideways consolidation. (And unlike meme stonks Amazon is capable of holding those gains, that's what a consolidation range is). You just have to be patient. No one knows when Amazon will move but when it does move it moves BIG.

178,IDXX," ZTS: #1 animal pharmaceutical company... they sell a good chunk of their meds on Chewy. Zoetis should benefit from rising demand for 
companion and production animal health products, 
particularly in emerging markets, new products and product 
line extensions, expanding ancillary service offerings, and 
greater operating and working capital efficiencies. 
Opportunistic investments in acquisitions and/or 
partnerships should supplement growth. My price target is $185.

IDXX: IDXX is a leading provider of diagnostic and information technology products and services for pet and production animal health, water quality and milk safety, and human point-of-care diagnostics. IDXX is a market leader, and thanks to a rich new product 
cycle and positive trends in the companion animal health 
market, the company looks well positioned to continue its 
strong growth trajectory. While shares trading at premiums 
to both peers and the company's historical trends, the premium is well-deserved as company has a 
long-term runway for continued out-performance, driven 
by new product launches and an industry-leading 
commercial organization. My price target is $585.",ricke813,3,/r/stocks/comments/nnbtih/thoughts_on_chewy_as_a_buy_right_now/gztp0ko/,0.014,0.788,0.198,0.9862

Solid State batteries are not new, and that idea has been around since the early 2000s, yet no progress...

There are numerous problems they have and i looked at some of their earnings and slides and its not impressive... I have experience working with batteries like recycling electric car batteries and i know the chemistry and mathematics behind charging them and stuff... Some main problems i have with QS is that their production batteries do not offer more charge cycles than conventional batteries, they mention how they can be charged very fast, yet other conventional chemistries like lifepo4 can also be supercharged and samsung and lg make thousands of tons of those batteries per year, they are also fairly affordable and profitable, and there is **no** evidence that even if QS achieved a commericial solid state battery, it would be commerically profitable. Furthermore, if tesla reaches or goes lower than100$/kwh which they are close to, that is so cheap, people wont be willing to pay like 300/kwh or 500/kwh or god knows what QS will be charging...

1) Beyond the topics discussed here. Look into 1) how top open a tax advantaged account for retirement, 2) Figure out how much you need to save each year to be ready for retirement (If you start at your age 15% will do, if you put this off it could be 20%, 25% or more), and 3) create a portfolio for retirement. Do this early and the percentage you need to save stays low.

After this consider saving up a little extra that is non-retirement that will let you have access to the cash in the future. It will mostly be taxable.

Dividends are too often ignored, but they're great. Just make sure you have dividend reinvesting turned on. Too many brokerage websites favor growth stocks in how they display information to investors, because they only easily report back unrealized gains %, not cumulative gains % from the investment that includes dividends and dividend reinvestments. I've always been strong in dividends. I have T, JPM, PFE, CSX, and CSCO amongst others.

I still have plenty of Growth stocks and growth stocks have outpaced value stocks for the last decade or two, even with those dividends. I really blend both sides together. I scale back my growth stocks when I think the market is getting too risky and I increase Value and Cash. When I think the bull market will last longer I buy more growth. And we have had alot of bull market lately.... perhaps a bit too much.

I also don't ignore small and mid caps. There are times these do not perform as well, but there are times they outperform.

So I have T too. I don't want to convince you ditch it, but when a dividend gets that high, it means investors are expecting it to drop in value over time. They're worried they are getting increased competition or some of their products are losing consumers to technological innovation in other parts of the market. So in response T stops reinvesting into their business and they pay out well to shareholders, while they are profitable, anticipating a slow decline in their core business.

Now some new news....And I think this is mostly good. The company is splitting into two companies, so you will soon have 2 stocks, T and a new company.  1 will be a growth company that is Time Warner + Discovery Networks (merged) that are going to try a streaming television company to take on Netflix and others. This likely won't have a dividend.  The other will be T with its original core communications business intact, with their entertainment companies removed. The dividend is going to be cut in half. They're going to start investing into 5G networks in a large scale, while selling off their cable/satellite businesses, and it is going to take capitol, so they can't pay as large of a dividend.  The down side as an investor is we know this is needed for them to compete with Verizon and T-Mobile/Sprint, but we don't know that this will actually lead to anymore revenue. We just know they have to do it to keep up with consumers expectations and competition from the other mobile carriers.

We don't know yet if they can get extra revenue from connecting cars and/or other consumer electronic devices to a 5G network that can handle more than smartphones. We know that technology is possible, but as an investor we want to know they will get more money from consumers for that investment.

&#x200B;

Also, be careful with the ""Don't put in what you're not willing to lose"" argument. That is great advice for someone who is jumping into GME, high-growth/high-risk, and non-diversified gambles. But to plan for your retirement, you really need to invest your whole retirement savings in to the correct, cautious, diversified way to make it by age 65. Rather than trying to get large gains on a gamble, you take normal market gains and let time work to your advantage.

One of the first lessons I learned was the true cost of doing nothing. When I first started I was older than you, but I had about $20k in savings accounts. I made an investment account and moved my money over (I used Merrill Edge). There is a Performance chart that will let you compare how well your whole account does over time vs. any index. I default it to S&P 500 with total returns. Nearly 8 years later it shows S&P 500 TR up over 200%. My account up 140%. I compare my account in the last 1 year, 3 year, and 5 years and I'm tracking the S&P 500 TR or slightly ahead.

My first investment was a single mutual fund that I didn't get for 5 month and I only got $3000 worth. I didn't invest the rest of my money for another year. Now that was a really good year, but it didn't go up 60%. I just no longer have those gains from the first year (1.5 years, actually) also reinvested and giving me compounded gains.

Now much of this happened because I was too busy. My work was 100% travel where I couldn't get online much, but I really wish I had simple advice that was just put it in an Index fund, like SPY or VTI, until I feel more comfortable and adequately had time to read up on everything else. My original investment could be worth an additional $12k if I had and this number will grow over time, because of the compounded gains I would've gotten with that extra $12k invested now.

There is a cost of doing nothing. Just stay clear of risky things, non-diversified things, leveraged funds, high-risk funds, etc... until you really know what you're doing, understand them, and can lose that money your risking into a riskier idea.

That is my advice to you... diversify, get it all invested, but don't rely on just a few dividend stocks. Diversify with growth stocks too.

Start simple with a market index ETF. SPY buys you a piece of everything in the S&P 500, the 500 largest companies in the market. Diversify into other investment ideas once you feel comfortable. Don't put too much money into a single stock, unless you can stand to lose it, but don't let that stop you from investing for your retirement in a diversified market fund.

The only thing that should run counter to this, is you should still have a savings account where you put emergency funds for when your car breaks, house catches on fire (happened to me Jan 2020), lose your job, etc... If that happens simultaneously with a recession or dip in the market, you want funds you can grab without worry about your investments rebounding.

I compare my account in the last 1 year, 3 year, and 5 years and I'm tracking the S&P 500 TR or slightly ahead.

My first investment was a single mutual fund that I didn't get for 5 month and I only got $3000 worth. I didn't invest the rest of my money for another year. Now that was a really good year, but it didn't go up 60%. I just no longer have those gains from the first year (1.5 years, actually) also reinvested and giving me compounded gains.

Now much of this happened because I was too busy. My work was 100% travel where I couldn't get online much, but I really wish I had simple advice that was just put it in an Index fund, like SPY or VTI, until I feel more comfortable and adequately had time to read up on everything else. My original investment could be worth an additional $12k if I had and this number will grow over time, because of the compounded gains I would've gotten with that extra $12k invested now.

There is a cost of doing nothing. Just stay clear of risky things, non-diversified things, leveraged funds, high-risk funds, etc... until you really know what you're doing, understand them, and can lose that money your risking into a riskier idea.

That is my advice to you... diversify, get it all invested, but don't rely on just a few dividend stocks. Diversify with growth stocks too.

Start simple with a market index ETF. SPY buys you a piece of everything in the S&P 500, the 500 largest companies in the market. Diversify into other investment ideas once you feel comfortable. Don't put too much money into a single stock, unless you can stand to lose it, but don't let that stop you from investing for your retirement in a diversified market fund.

The only thing that should run counter to this, is you should still have a savings account where you put emergency funds for when your car breaks, house catches on fire (happened to me Jan 2020), lose your job, etc... If that happens simultaneously with a recession or dip in the market, you want funds you can grab without worry about your investments rebounding.

Sorry for the over lengthy read....",cwdawg15,0,/r/stocks/comments/nna2po/dividends_and_why_im_long_on_them_from_a_young/gzu07l6/,0.053,0.803,0.144,0.9989
232,TR," Few thoughts...

1) Beyond the topics discussed here. Look into 1) how top open a tax advantaged account for retirement, 2) Figure out how much you need to save each year to be ready for retirement (If you start at your age 15% will do, if you put this off it could be 20%, 25% or more), and 3) create a portfolio for retirement. Do this early and the percentage you need to save stays low.

After this consider saving up a little extra that is non-retirement that will let you have access to the cash in the future. It will mostly be taxable.

&#x200B;

Dividends are too often ignored, but they're great. Just make sure you have dividend reinvesting turned on. Too many brokerage websites favor growth stocks in how they display information to investors, because they only easily report back unrealized gains %, not cumulative gains % from the investment that includes dividends and dividend reinvestments. I've always been strong in dividends. I have T, JPM, PFE, CSX, and CSCO amongst others.

I still have plenty of Growth stocks and growth stocks have outpaced value stocks for the last decade or two, even with those dividends. I really blend both sides together. I scale back my growth stocks when I think the market is getting too risky and I increase Value and Cash. When I think the bull market will last longer I buy more growth. And we have had alot of bull market lately.... perhaps a bit too much.

I also don't ignore small and mid caps. There are times these do not perform as well, but there are times they outperform.

So I have T too. I don't want to convince you ditch it, but when a dividend gets that high, it means investors are expecting it to drop in value over time. They're worried they are getting increased competition or some of their products are losing consumers to technological innovation in other parts of the market. So in response T stops reinvesting into their business and they pay out well to shareholders, while they are profitable, anticipating a slow decline in their core business.

Now some new news....And I think this is mostly good. The company is splitting into two companies, so you will soon have 2 stocks, T and a new company.  1 will be a growth company that is Time Warner + Discovery Networks (merged) that are going to try a streaming television company to take on Netflix and others. This likely won't have a dividend.  The other will be T with its original core communications business intact, with their entertainment companies removed. The dividend is going to be cut in half. They're going to start investing into 5G networks in a large scale, while selling off their cable/satellite businesses, and it is going to take capitol, so they can't pay as large of a dividend.  The down side as an investor is we know this is needed for them to compete with Verizon and T-Mobile/Sprint, but we don't know that this will actually lead to anymore revenue. We just know they have to do it to keep up with consumers expectations and competition from the other mobile carriers.

We don't know yet if they can get extra revenue from connecting cars and/or other consumer electronic devices to a 5G network that can handle more than smartphones. We know that technology is possible, but as an investor we want to know they will get more money from consumers for that investment.

&#x200B;

Also, be careful with the ""Don't put in what you're not willing to lose"" argument. That is great advice for someone who is jumping into GME, high-growth/high-risk, and non-diversified gambles. But to plan for your retirement, you really need to invest your whole retirement savings in to the correct, cautious, diversified way to make it by age 65. Rather than trying to get large gains on a gamble, you take normal market gains and let time work to your advantage.

One of the first lessons I learned was the true cost of doing nothing. When I first started I was older than you, but I had about $20k in savings accounts. I made an investment account and moved my money over (I used Merrill Edge). There is a Performance chart that will let you compare how well your whole account does over time vs. any index. I default it to S&P 500 with total returns. Nearly 8 years later it shows S&P 500 TR up over 200%. My account up 140%. I compare my account in the last 1 year, 3 year, and 5 years and I'm tracking the S&P 500 TR or slightly ahead.

My first investment was a single mutual fund that I didn't get for 5 month and I only got $3000 worth. I didn't invest the rest of my money for another year. Now that was a really good year, but it didn't go up 60%. I just no longer have those gains from the first year (1.5 years, actually) also reinvested and giving me compounded gains.

Now much of this happened because I was too busy. My work was 100% travel where I couldn't get online much, but I really wish I had simple advice that was just put it in an Index fund, like SPY or VTI, until I feel more comfortable and adequately had time to read up on everything else. My original investment could be worth an additional $12k if I had and this number will grow over time, because of the compounded gains I would've gotten with that extra $12k invested now.

There is a cost of doing nothing. Just stay clear of risky things, non-diversified things, leveraged funds, high-risk funds, etc... until you really know what you're doing, understand them, and can lose that money your risking into a riskier idea.

Take a look at WeedMaps (SSPK) which is having a major catalyst event on 6/10 when the merger and ticker change is happening changing SSPK to MAPS - this way you can play the cannabis trend AND a stock specific catalyst of the ticker change. As someone that was in KERN, I think SSPK is the better play. There is a dedicated WeedMaps sub on Reddit  that you should check out. Check out interview on CNBC with SSPK/WM CEO:

That being said, LPX has gone absolutely bonkers compared to its long-term trend, so maybe there's still room to run.

309,DD," Biotech has been popular due to Covid. I think there are a lot of companies with potential, especially because the space is quite large and there are a lot of small cap companies that are still to break out. I would not focus on the Covid manufacturers because I think they will stagnate for a while.

If you want to look for companies, I would look for companies that are developing drugs that are nearing the end of phase 2, phase 3 trials or those that are pending FDA approval.

What i have seen happen in this space is that a successful trial phase pops the stock and successful FDA pops the stock again. Usually then I sell and let the stock drop down and consolidate for 1-2 months and buy in again 1 quarter after FDA approval. This gives 1 quarter for the company to start the marketing and sales activities and you will see the stock pop again if it has been successful.

It takes a lot of time and effort doing DD on small/medium cap biotech if you do it seriously",LowTraining670,3,/r/stocks/comments/nnv2z9/vaccine_swing_trading_advice/gzwkpuw/,0.02,0.863,0.116,0.9578

323,EDIT," sorry for the loss of your family member. 

I was the executor for my dad's estate, so not a pro but here's what I can offer. these laws vary state by state, so check with /r/legaladvce and a local estate lawyer. but in general: 

- someone needs to be appointed by the court to handle the estate of the deceased. this person will get a court order to access banks or other accounts, sell assets, etc. DO NOTHING until you have this court order. NOTHING. if anyone accesses banks or investments without a court order, or takes/sells assets, it's theft from the estate and can have criminal penalties. inheritances are the FINAL step of the process. 

- best case, there's a last will or testament in a file drawer somewhere at their house. start looking for this paperwork (or other paperwork: bank records, insurance, online passwords lists, etc). if not, you will need to file for an ""intestate estate"", meaning there's no will. either way, talk to a lawyer or a court clerk for how to file to start probate. 

- if there's a will, submit it to the court and follow the terms of will. if not, submit the other paperwork to the court, follow the local law for intestate estate. there are specific rules for how to divide up inheritances w/out a will, don't make it up as you go. 

- in general, the person in charge of the estate needs to do the following, roughly in this order: (a) add up the value of all assets the deceased owned (bank accounts, stocks, cars, property, computers, etc...). (b) gather up all the bills, sometimes announcing the death in a local newspaper is required or recommended. print up a form letter to send out if anyone gets pushy: ""John Doe has died, enclosed is a copy of an obituary/death certificate, we will be in touch ASAP to  settle his debts."" (c) pay the bills out of assets. (d) if assets are left over after paying the bills, then pass out inheritances. if there are not enough assets to pay the bills, nobody gets inheritances and not all the bills get paid (some state laws order payment in order of priority (funeral costs first, taxes second, etc), other states pay a percentage of assets to all debts if there is a shortfall). this is why you need to see a lawyer. 

- life insurance is usually not part of an estate, and bypasses all the court stuff and gets paid to the beneficiary ASAP. if bank or investment accounts have a joint-ownership or payable on death provision, they are NOT part of the estate and go directly to the joint owner or beneficiary. if the banks/investments DO NOT have a beneficiary, they are considered part of the estate and need to be used to pay bills before possible inheritance. 

that's basically it. the process takes a few months, mostly paperwork, and rarely costs more than a few thousand dollars. for low-value estates (under $100,000 or so), there's usually a cheaper, expedited process that's a few hundred bucks.

EDIT: at the end, it all needs to be reviewed/approved by a judge. so keep good paperwork and records.

EDIT 2: and during all this process, someone will need to do final income taxes for the deceased https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/deceased-taxpayers-filing-the-estate-income-tax-return-form-1041",harrison_wintergreen,9,/r/stocks/comments/nnps1g/a_family_member_died_who_had_some_investments/gzvstun/,0.061,0.866,0.073,0.8083
324,COIN," Seems like their revenue is directly tied to the price of crypto since they take a percentage of each transaction. So buying their shares is essentially a bet on the price of the broader crypto market but with the added risk that they face competition in that space. 

Doesn't seem like a choice that is going to help you diversify at all. 

Additionally, since they did a direct offering insiders are selling their shares directly on the secondary market which seems to have put more downward pressure on the price than a traditional IPO just due to the volume of selling.

329,JPM," How is having a reason to spend more on infrastructure a bad thing? Infrastructure cost scales so that would make it more efficient to run more up time.

For instance you pay $1B for infrastructure a month but I’m able to to make $1.1B on it.

If I have the ability to scale my cost to $10B I’m able to now make $11B. (This doesn’t include more than a linear relationship when it would be more exponential in reality)

335,CPA," Publicly traded American companies (and European for that matter) have to be audited by independent auditors, which supposedly helps reduce the amount of misstatements on companies financial statements. 
The auditors follow rules outlined by the PCAOB (in America) and IFRS (in Europe)  in some cases, auditors were incompetent (like with Madoff - not publicly traded, but still audited) or took too aggressive of an interpretation of the rules to help keep their multimillion dollar account happy (Enron). So it's definitely not perfect, but it's better than what Chinese companies have (which I think is basically publishing what the government will allow).

Source: I am an auditor/CPA

Additionally, China has rules around non-chinese ownership of companies in critical industries, which includes tech. So technically, as an American, when you're buying stock in many Chinese companies (or in index funds that hold Chinese companies in sensitive industries) you're buying ""American Depository Receipts"" (ADR). ADRs give you the rights to your share of the company's profits. May seem like an arbitrary distinction, but it makes the accounting even more complicated when the company is listed on an American stock exchange and has to follow SEC guidance (including a PCAOB audit)",RevolutionaryLog6566,1,/r/stocks/comments/nnolv0/yes_chinese_companies_have_lied_about_their/gzvjnsa/,0.05,0.823,0.128,0.9597
