Speculative trading for unusually high returns carries tremendous risk precisely because it's predicated on irrational volatility, that is, stock prices deviating farther and farther from their actual operating value.

The price is correcting down slowly and will rise slowly once it settles at fair value. Stop buying until it evens out a little and get the notion of ""buy the dip"" out of your head, you need to be patient.

Edit: if love the stock and are actually investing you should be happy it's going down because it gives you better buying opportunities.

133,PLTR," They are definitely on the right path tho. So far there has been 4 main criticism towards PLTR, all very fair.
1) No one knew exactly about what they are doing and their products. This one got addressed in the Palantir day where they showcased two of their products: Gotham and Foundry.  
2) Heavy reliance on government contracts. They‚Äôve hired a team of salesmen that yielded them incredible amount of new contracts in the private sector in short space of time. This is a bullish sign that there‚Äôs a real demand for what their do.
3) Palantir being private company (that originally never intended on going public) for 17 years, resulted a huge amount of insider shares. Now that the lockup period is over, the fear of sales avalanche from insiders has died down.  
4) Profitability. This is the critical point that they haven‚Äôt filled.

166,OPEN," You have 100 shares of nok, you would SELL TO OPEN 1 call contract (1 contract is for 100 shares) for the $5 strike. 

I just looked and an April 1 expiry with $5 strike, last sold was for a $0.05 premium (which is per share, so $5 for the contract). 

You collect the $5 right away, it‚Äôs yours, and you‚Äôre locked in to sell your 100 shares for $5/each up until April 1. 

If nok goes to $5.50/share by April 1, you‚Äôre going to be selling for $5/share, total $500. But you already got the $5 ($0.05/share) premium, so you really sold your shares for $5.05/each. 

You could BUY TO CLOSE your contract, which you‚Äôd be paying the premium to buy back a contract for 100 shares, so then you‚Äôre no longer obligated to sell your shares. 

If it goes to $7 in the next week and you decide you want to keep your shares, that‚Äôs when you‚Äôd BUY TO CLOSE. The premium would likely be around $2.00/share ($200 for the contract). And if you did that, you‚Äôd be down $195 ($200premium paid - $5 premium collected)

But if you‚Äôre okay selling your shares for the $5/each, you wouldn‚Äôt do anything to the contract or your shares.

167,NOK," This example with NOK is very well written. 
I‚Äôll add one valuation view to this example:
I do not trade options if my premium only returned 1% of the current stock value. I prefer a little more meat on the bone for my trouble and reduction in upside profit potential. 

This added premium only comes with either more risk (volatility) or more time (later expiration date). 

The advanced lesson that ties these things together comes back to concepts of option pricing and price movement. I‚Äôm not trying to complicate things and I won‚Äôt go into a full description of the factors of price and price movement, but at some point, when you‚Äôre ready, go to TastyTrades and watch a video or two on ‚Äúthe Greeks‚Äù, particularly Delta.

177,AI," Here is some thoughts from another reditor who wrote a previous post concerning the ""Japan effect""

Bonds, immigration,¬† and Japanese inflation. 

No way. AI is going to automate so much of this stuff that companies are going to be 10x more productive. The big will get bigger. Owning equities is the best way to take part in this next revolution. I expect it to be like industrial and computer revolutions as far as increases in productivity. You‚Äôll want to be on that train! 

Japans markets on an inflation adjusted basis aren‚Äôt as bad as people make them out to be, and the biggest reason for their stagnation wasn‚Äôt due to handling of money but due to demographics. Each year for the past 30 years the total number of working people in Japan decreased! This offset natural growth in productivity to end up with a flat/stagnant gdp and equities curve. The labor market was supply constrained so labor was too expensive for big companies there and they couldn‚Äôt compete with overseas, and so their profits suffered, causing less investment and lower equity prices. 

This is why net positive immigration into the US is such a good thing. 

Luckily though once AI hits this next revolution these won‚Äôt be things we need to worry about, because we can manufacture workers. It‚Äôll solve Japan‚Äôs problems and cause a a productivity boom. 

Context is important: Japanese people are like this because there literally is no space for more people. 

They already live in tiny, tiny spaces and have no room. Everything is expensive and costly, because land is a limited resource. 

Their culture of being unfriendly to babies and immigrants is justified in the context of their existence. It does have the side effect of stagnating the economy. They can only grow through improvements in productivity aka tech, and not through growth in population. This helps explain why japan has had a tech forward economy for years. 

In 1985 Japan had 121 million people, and now in 2020 they have 126 million. In 1985 the US had 238 million and in 2020 they have 328 million. 

As a side note the lower 48 states comprise 3.1 million sq miles, while japan has 145,000 sq miles of area. So they have 1/3rd the population but 1/21st the area. 

The US added nearly 100 million people while Japan added 6 million. Of course the GDP growth is going to be way higher for the US over that time period. 

Additionally, while Japan added 6 million people in total over those 35 years, their working population shifted upwards and wasn't sufficiently replaced, so the total pool of working age people actually shrunk considerably. 

This caused Japan's stagnant economy. Not monetary policy.",shutupandpractice,33,/r/stocks/comments/lz6l1a/breaking_us_senate_votes_to_pass_19t_pandemic/gpzyl1s/,0.07,0.823,0.107,0.9609

195,TSLA," I was a TSLA bear for a long time because I wanted to stay ""rational"":

1. Someone close to me is very familiar with the car industry and he kept talking about car industry's  ""low margins"" and their ""fragility with any defects,"" etc., etc.
2. I read TOO many comments here and especially on reddit/investing about the fundamentals and the value and ""the P/E ratio, and how crazy overvalued it is"" even when the stock was 70 dollars. (Yes, there is a W. Buffet kind of investing, but there is also the Templeton kind, and Templeton would have bought Tesla.)

I was happy to dive all in during this drop:

1. Because Nobel Prizes in economy have been awarded for the research showing that economy is not simply rational, but also emotional. (If people love a product, they will support it.)
2. Because even Warren Buffet, the ultimate value investor, said that one of the reasons you should buy a stock is if you are proud to take ownership (however small) in a company. I love Tesla's vision. I love their cars. I love their philosophy. I'm proud to own a tiny bit of them.
3. Even the car-industry family member admitted that carmakers never manage to put their prototype-ideal on the road (which is what all these competitors are up against), but that Musk achieved this, despite the fact that it is almost impossible. That is the kind of S. Jobs-leadership I trust.
4. I have a 13-year-old student in China whom I teach online. She's brilliant and fascinated with science. One day, she said: ""I saw a Tesla today in my neighborhood!"" and her eyes sparkled. Yes, this is just an anecdote, but I was taken aback because she is not a materialist, and her love for this Tesla car she saw was the love for future, for science, for cleaner air and new technologies.

If I lose on this investment, I'll be at peace with it. I do need the money, as any middle class person does, but (after buying boring and rational investments) I'm finally standing behind a product and a company that I do believe in, respect, and even love.

231,TSLA," It's not speculators. The whole market dropped because of liquidity issues in treasury securities. Institutions got the hell out of tech and into banking and oil. 

And then they tried to kill the stock by piling into puts at 2dte 600 strike, then further with 0dte 550p, and spreading rumors online that Elon Musk died. This also meant a bunch of longs who used margin got margin called. While all this was going on, they were shorting ARKK. The theory being that ARK makes the equities they own more volatile and extremely correlated, so if TSLA took a dump, it would be amplified in ARKK. 

It was short term predatory opportunism that had nothing to do with value of anything at all and everything to do with mechanics.

This will continue until volatility settles down, the Fed fixes the bond markets, or it falls to something that even fincels find absurd. Or Elon blows out Q1 earnings or something. Then speculators would drive the price up and make the quants cry.

I mean sure, but a DCF is just a tool. It's used by value and growth investors alike, and allows for a financial expression of opinion specifically on things like growth rates, ERP, beta, etc. It gets deeper when you start making assumptions about more complex aspects of the financial statement like capex or margins.

For certain, but in low discount rate environments, more and more PV gets assigned to the long end of the CF/TV. It takes bold investors to have opinions about CF's that far away (and confident in their long run macro assumptions) but sometimes that prophecy can be self fulfilling.

And that's certainly ones prerogative, but it gets further away from Graham's definition of investing and further into the arena of speculation.

336,IBM," Is Tesla overvalued? Sure, I completely agree and can't begin to think anything different. But, to all the people that say ""Tesla is not going to be the major player in EV"",  ***you're fooling yourselves.*** There's a million studies that say that human buying decisions are completely irrational and driven **MAINLY** by their emotions.

When Apple unveiled the Iphone, there were at least 20 companies who had the technology, skills and capital to build a compelling competitor. Guess what? The Iphone is the most sold consumer product in the history of time.

People are literally foaming at the mouth to get their hands on a Tesla. They're willing to pre-order it and put their money down without even knowing when it'll be shipped to them. It changes their idea of what owning and driving a car means. Forever. There's plenty of car makers that can make something similar to what Tesla does. Sure. But Tesla has already created the paradigm shift and is so far ahead from any alternatives, that even if they spent all their money investing in a competitor car, it'll be a **blip** in Tesla's future sales. Nor they'll come closer to what Tesla is.

I'm absolutely fed up of how hyper-rational, short sighted and dumbfounded people are on the power of innovation. Yes, everyone will compete on EV, but the rate at which Tesla is (and beware, will continue to be) is quite literally unachievable. Current competitors will have to go full throttle for 5 years, and Tesla will have to literally stop innovating, to arrive there. If you add the power of branding, the feeling of belonging and status, and the delight in the experience people receive from driving one. You're looking at Tesla's market-share ownership of at least 30%. Easily. 

Sure, over-valued blah blah blah, other companies will compete blah blah blah, they barely made any sales blah blah blah. But get a kid/teenager inside a Tesla ONCE for 5 minutes and he'll ***forever be changed***, and will carry that feeling with him forever and will tell everyone and his cousin about it. And there's nothing more powerful than an NPS score of almost 100. Not P/E ratio, not EPS, not gross margins. Don't underestimate that feeling when it comes to sales.

The same thought process was made with Nokia and phones, IBM and computers, and tonnes of other companies. And look at us now, do you own an Iphone, a Mac or an Ipad? Yeah, I thought so.

But at that point, surely the growth is going to slow significantly? Trading at 50x earnings when you're already dominating the market is to assume that Tesla will keep growing rapidly, eventually crush the market taking a huge % of global car sales.

Also the FSD section seems to assume that virtually everyone is happy to pay a subscription for their car on top of the purchase price, unless I'm missing something? Not sure how justified that is.

362,TSLA," > because I thought that Tesla can reach 3000$ as Amazon for example

Im trying to be nice because it is obvious that you dont understand anything (which you admit). Stocks are based on market cap, not price. The fact that amazon is $3000 and Tsla is $900 is irrelevant. At $900, Tsla's market cap was $800 billion. That means if Tsla stock was to get to $3000 it would be worth 2.6 trillion, which is more than what apple is worth currently. 

Apple just had a $100 billion revenue QUARTER (there are 4 of those in a year), whereas Tesla just had made 10 billion in the last quarter. Even if Tesla grew 50% for the next 5 years (which is pretty hard to do, especially as every 50% rise in revenue becomes harder and harder), they would only be matching apple's current valuation. It is insane of anyone to think that Tsla will be fairly valued at $1 trillion market cap anytime in the next 10 years, and they are priced for perfection.

It is not economically impossible, but they would have to literally sell 100% of the EV's worldwide plus all the batteries. Cars do not make much profit. 

Its highly unlikely and I hope you dont have too much in TSLA. Its not that i recommend selling, i just think it has a lot lower to go. Maybe 25 years from now TSLA stock is higher than $1000, but its going to be pretty hard to get there in terms of ""fair value""",Boston_Bruins37,21,/r/stocks/comments/lyyfxn/tesla_breaks_a_record_the_biggest_sixweek_drop_in/gpy9nft/,0.049,0.842,0.109,0.9235

368,ICE," You don't seem to be talking about EVs at all. You are talking about digitalization which is completely different. An ICE vehicle can be digitalized too. 

This is not easy, true. However, competitors have closed the gap greatly with Tesla in terms of self-driving. In fact, Honda just released the only mass produced Level 3 autonomous vehicle that exists. Tesla's self-driving is only Level 2+.

Regardless, it is unknown how important Tesla's lead is in this. There is a big gap between Full Self Driving which Tesla is likely 10 years away from and driving automation as long as the driver is 100% paying attention which is what they offer now. 

As a customer, I will not pay much for the latter and as a business I will not pay much for the latter. In fact, driving is what makes sitting in the car not boring. If I am on a road trip, etc, and the car is driving itself, but I still need to 100% pay attention and have my eyes on the road, etc, what did I gain? I just become more bored.

397,BB," In my opinion there are two or three key factors to consider with regards to the future success of these ev companies.


1. Charging infrastructure. Tesla's charging infrastructure is vastly unmatched and would be difficult to even come close to barring some sort of government mandate requiring an open standard for super charging. This appears to be less of a factor in europe however.

2. EV makers dedication to engineering driving enhancements. Think giant touchscreens, autonomous driving, improved voice recognition.  Traditional car makers are still super sluggish to this. I personally think they see this as a waste of engineering cost. However they could sub this out to tech companies that actually know how to do this See BB Android auto.

3. Initial head start.

Maybe electrohydrolysis could be scaled to produce mass amounts of hydrogen. Again I‚Äôm no chemist so maybe the energy balance doesn‚Äôt make sense, but maybe these hydrogen-producing plants could be built in Arizona or Iowa, where the sun or wind could be used to provide the electricity require to convert water to hydrogen. That could potentially be as green as it gets. No mining for lithium or other metals required for battery tech. 

The fact that there are no hydrogen ‚Äústations‚Äù should not deter us. This could easily be built out. There were no gas stations when the automobile came online either. Could this be scaled where people could create their own hydrogen at home through renewable-powered electrohydrolysis systems?

It's expected to survive a crash, absorb the energy of the crash, and protect the battery.  Li-Ion batteries do not like impact.  I know from personal experience that the models we use for crash analysis are ""perfect world"" scenarios.  Which is understandable because it's difficult to predict what a crash will look like.  Crashes are messy, we'll likely see more injuries due to fires, or delayed fires. So that's just the structural side of it.

On the power side of it, I think range will be a huge issue in the US.  In the northern states you'll see people losing most of the range to wanting heat on in the winter.  In the southern states they will lose range due to people wanting to run the AC.  If it was a few miles that would be one thing, but we're talking a major reduction in range.  On top of that every charge/discharge cycle reduces your range.  
Don't get me wrong, I think EVs have their place.  The majority of the ""fly over"" states have people who just commute too far.

461,SE," The Taiwanese companies are already moving their production facilities into SE Asia. Foxconn, Pegatron, Wistron all have been moving their facilties out of China in the early 2010s due to rising labor costs in China. The trade war and tariffs have increased the cost of business in China. Political uncertainty between Taiwan and China have further pushed Taiwanese companies out of China.  The biggest draw in the 1970s and on was that there was a mutually understood language and cultural affinity.  But that alone isn't enough to override the other issues and the identity of Taiwan as Chinese is fading.

Before you say that this or that American company manufactures in China, most of the big US names that have been completely gutted and run on brand alone are manufactured by Chinese companies or Taiwanese companies in China.

462,AI," So i'm not going to sit here and dismiss the fact that Tesla has stuff to work on in terms of the vehicle itself, I do hear that quality control is an issue. Can't speak on behalf of Tesla obviously, but I believe they're focused a bit more on the technology side of things and they may see that fixing EV related components can be easily done vs getting technology right.

In terms of what i believe they're far ahead in, it's mainly autonomous. And that's largely in part to what they have planned in the next decade (or more, when it comes to fruition), to create an autonomous taxi network.

Kind of like uber, but much, much cheaper since they won't require a driver. However, to create this autonomous taxi network, they HAVE to get it right. And the key to doing this is collecting as much data on autonomous driven miles as possible so that their AI can figure out how to best navigate a car on autopilot in every situation possible and lower the risk of a serious accident. Think about all the different scenarios on the road. Picture yourself on the highway, you want to switch lanes, but what if some asshole 100m+ behind, in the lane that you want to merge onto, is speeding at, idk 150 miles an hour? If Tesla decided to merge onto that lane without it detecting that asshole, boom serious accident. Their cars only have a certain radius right now but there are just so many situations on the road that the only way to lower the risk is to put the car through every situation possible (and yes, even accidents unfortunately) so that the AI learns about it. Now again - Tesla is already at over 2 billion miles of autonomous data collected, no one else even comes close. Tesla's pretty much 10 laps ahead of second place, and that's where they'll continue to dominate.

These carbon credits are currently sold to other companies so that they can meet requirements - as these companies don't need to pay for those anymore then they will lose that side of their business and will be more based on selling cars.

The reason I WOULD pay for that though is IF they can get the autonomous driving down. Now, that could be a possibility with vertical integration if he can get his satellite platform in Starlink to connect to cars to help with the mapping, but, they had to tear down the first system almost completely to start anew for their autonomous vehicles platform. Without figuring that part out and ""hoping"" it happens the cars are just expensive EVs with a good batter where others will catch up, and, it will make it so he can't do his taxi service.

492,PYPL," Regarding SQ, Square: great company, great revenue, getting into banking. P/E is 400+, market cap is 1/3 of big banks. 

However, the stock is moving inversely to 10yr yield. It seems that we're in a good (economic and covid) news is bad news(for square/tech) environment. I feel like we're going to be in for good news to come. I know that timing is a fool's errand.

there has been no development in the past year that would justify a share price that's 5x where it was a year ago. is some improvement in share price warranted? yes. 5x? no. Tesla's losing market share in EU (the top EV market), has stiff competition in China. all the other carmakers are stepping up their EV game.

TSLA fair value is probably somewhere near $200 to $300, possibly even lower than that as Elon's massive Bitcoin purchase has injected major volatility to the balance sheet.

edit: plus Michael Burry announced his Tesla short back in December. as usual, he timed it perfectly. he's a savant for this stuff.  people have lost billions shorting Tesla but Burry don't screw around. if he says Telsa is gonna fall, I'm not betting against him.",harrison_wintergreen,10,/r/stocks/comments/lyncqt/now_that_tech_growth_stocks_have_gone_down_30/gptw1p3/,0.062,0.816,0.123,0.772

It isn't that it isn't a great fast growing company, it is that doesn't mean that is justification for to blindly go up over 600% in a 12 month period.

Valuing a company and its risks accurately isn't about how great a company is. It is about it being accurately valued.

You can boost a company that is EXCELLLENT, but should it be valued at $400? $600? $1000? When it was just $155 a year ago? All of those are huge gains over $155, so why as high as $880?

You have to look at the fundamentals and stack it up against the risks.

The P/E earnings ratio is absurdly high, not just normal high for a growing tech company.

&#x200B;

Off  of the CFRA report, TSLA has $2.24 earnings per share in 2020. They are estimating $4.25 earnings per share in 2021 and $6.60 earnings per share  in 2022.

It is now trading at $600/share and was just at $800/share.

At $600/share...

If  we assume these estimates come to fruition, and these are are high growth estimates, this is trading on a 2021Estimate P/E at $141/share.   2022Estimate P/E would be at $91/share. That is still based on future  estimates that haven't been realized yet and have some uncertainty  attached to them.

That is a P/E earning ratio of $91 at current price on estimates 2 years away!

To me that is  too high. It is trading today at what it should be highly priced at in 2 years  if there is still the same forward momentum for 2023 and 2024.

Morningstar currently puts a Fair Value estimate at $349.00. I'd feel much more comfortable with it in the $300-$425 range and that is aggressive pricing for a growing company with a typical high P/E.

It isn't a knock on the company. It's a great company and I expect great things from them. It is simply just overvalued too much even 1 or 2 years out.

I'd  rather stick with AMD or AAPL, among a few others. The P/E are still high, but more modest in the 35-40 range.

643,TD," Good Luck!

One thing I did when I started out, I bought a few things to serve as a long-term bench mark for myself and never repurchased, except for dividend reinvestments.

I bought the minimum purchase into a Target-Year Retirement mutual fund. I don't recommend these funds directly, though.  The fund buys into other mutual funds in the market, not too unlike what we are talking about. They also buy into some international funds, bond funds, etc as well. This is how I first learned to pick a part an investment strategy and now it one such thing I use as a comparison over time.

I use it more as a learning tool to see how they buy the market and how it changes over time. I can also see when I outperform it, but I can also see when my holdings are more volatile and fall more in downturns. Just as a measure to keep me honest in the bad times, as well as the good.

One thing to watch out for.... All brokerage firms display 'Unrealized gains' fairly well, but not all show 'cumulative investment return.' I use Merrill Edge and they only show cumulative investment return easily with mutual funds. This measure shows me how much I gain I have through dividends being reinvested into the fund.

I mention this, because many people starting out go for high growth and easily forget about the effects of dividends. I have one mutual fund, as an example, that has 78% unrealized gains. It has 190% cumulative investment returns that to dividend investments and their gains.

Because ETFs trade like stock, their web-browser based platform doesn't show this. Interestingly enough their iPad platform does for ETFs, so I suspect they working on this.

The platform I have at Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade doesn't show this to me by default at all.

&#x200B;

Too many people aren't valuing value stocks with higher dividends enough, because they do not see the cumulative effects of these dividend reinvestments in their portfolio at a glance easily.  Learn your trading platform and see what you need to do to examine this and consider buying a few small benchmarks, so you can watch the % cumulative return of different types of funds. There might also be some websites where you can build a fake portfolio, without money invested, that might show this.",cwdawg15,2,/r/stocks/comments/lyu64n/which_etf_should_i_choose_for_long_term_1015_years/gpzzn38/,0.052,0.821,0.127,0.9845
644,TSLA," Oh absolutely I will wait, atleast until I recoup my losses on ARKK.  I have a position in ARKF in my brokerage account currently, and honestly I like the holdings and foresee them all as companies with bright futures.   The reason I originally went with ARKK was for added TSLA exposure to compliment my 25 shares, but now that TSLA is in VOO/VT, which I already positions in, I feel it is safe to hedge towards other companies.  

In your opinion, would it be TOO conservative to recoup my loses with ARKK in a few months (hopefully) and move it all to VT?

651,DOW," I mean you just gave us a lot of your feelings and antidotes without any justification on why stock will go up.

Don't get me wrong DCA regardless of price is valid strategy that out preforms most.  But if you make a prediction back it up with something. 

For example, **reasons why long term you should rotate out of growth stocks:**

Real yields are negative right now because of economic uncertainty. America will get everyone vaccinated in two months. There is no more uncertainty anymore so investors aren't willing to take negative real yields.

Inflation expectations: Daddy Powell have been VERY clear about adjusting to a long term 2% average inflation target instead of 2%.

Economy reopening: greater money velocity / shift back into oversold stock such as airlines etc.

Broad money supply has grown because America is sending stimulus out to people, that and white collar WFH professionals saved a ton of cash (and are expecting some student loan debt cancellation on top).

Powell has been clear recently about sticking to the course instead of capping long term yields. The markets will need a bigger temper tantrum than this to change his mind. Also the current American president doesn't base his success on how many times the DOW crosses 30,000.

Should you pull out to cash? Probably not. Should you hold tech darlings that you convinced yourself are 2x as valuable as they where a year ago? Probably not.

**Reasons why growth stock may melt up one more time**

The FED dumps the treasury general account shooting short term rates negative while funding Biden's stimulus that will increase broad money supply by sending people cash.",icbcrepair,5,/r/stocks/comments/lz8xtz/if_you_were_one_of_those_people_who_sat_on_the/gq09dkl/,0.103,0.789,0.109,0.2187

702,GME," I‚Äôm not totally shutting down your thoughts, I have questions about some things too, but:

We all know 90%+ of traders fail, I heard a career trader cite 3 bullsh*t reasons (his words) traders blame for failure. One was market manipulation, or ‚Äòthe market is rigged‚Äô. The problem with blaming the markets is that it is an abstention from responsibility. When are poor choices your own fault and not ‚Äòmanipulation‚Äô. When I see odd things like GME skyrocketing and the entire market selling off, I know that it is probably not a great time for me to be playing in the markets, but I do so knowing I am taking risk.

The ‚Äòcrash‚Äô for corona was tame as far as crashes go. Not nearly as much fallout as 2007. The fundamental reasons for corona did not involve a system that cast a lot of doubt on the stability of markets. 

15% in 16 months is awesome. Doing that with a crash in the middle is excellent returns. Dont think so? Then average returns for the last 40 years. You really wanna get scared? Average returns for the last 100 years. They are not grand.

There is a reason why you hear diversify. Diversity is boring, but if you avoid it, expect risk. If you had bought 2 years ago, never looked, and went back to look today, what if any effect would you have seen on your portfolio from the corona crash? None. It recovered in months. Now if you capitulated and sold and tossed things around in that time, like I did too, then yeah it sucks. Hind sight and all.

We lose because we cannot control our emotions, or we pick risky things to begin with.

Woods buys TSLA - TSLA bumps up - ARKK bumps up - people see ARKK bump and pour money into it - Woods needs to use that inflow so she buys... more TSLA - TSLA bumps up more - ARKK bumps up more - more people pour money in - repeat, repeat, repeat. 

HOWEVER!!! The same thing happens with outflow. Maybe people take profit. Maybe something happens that no one even understands. Big institutions sell of chunks, whatever. TSLA drops - ARKK drops - Woods needs to sell off some TSLA - TSLA drops - people start bailing on TSLA and ARKK - the drops accelerate - the stock drops faster - repeat, repeat, repeat.

I have a meeting on Wednesday to talk specifically about ARK family and how best to leverage their moves without actually buying in to them. I like the approach but I‚Äôd rather buy the stocks I want myself. I have TSLA, and I have S&P and index funds etc etc who all also own TSLA, and if I go ARKK now I own a bunch more TSLA.

729,GME," The main thesis I see is that the GME short interest data isn't accurate, because the fines for inaccurate reporting are just lunch money to decent sized hedge funds. While it's true that the fines for misreporting are absurdly low, and while it's true that widespread fraud isn't a new thing in investing (bond ratings agencies anyone), I think this thesis is a trap set by shorts themselves.

Volume right now is low. There's a ton of puts that expire on 3/26 with a strike price of $5. I seriously think someone is painting the tape right now, trying to attract more money, and then they're going to try to screw everyone and short the whole way down. I would bet this will start the week before those puts expire. For now, I'm holding, watching closely, and not caring if a bunch of people on the internet call me paper hands. In fact, I'm trying to warn them. This isn't the same scenario as last time, and if those of us who own GME right now try the same play, I think we'll get burned. Hedge fund bears are dumb for having overshorted the first time around out of pure greed (seriously wtf, how is it ok to bankrupt a company on purpose just to avoid buying back your shares?) I highly doubt they're dumb enough to do the same thing twice. Plus, their short positions this time aren't nearly as dangerous because they shorted at higher prices. 

Who knows, maybe a gamma squeeze could lead into another short squeeze. That would be impressive and I'm here for that. But I'm going to jump off rather than get crushed if things go the other way. The worst thing about the media misinformation that circulated in January (like those bullshit stories about WSB buying silver) is that it's now made it hard for people to trust any information at all. That's exactly the kind of scenario that benefits an institution that *does* have access to information they can trust.

‚Ä¢ Market leader in a transformative business model: telehealth. Makes visiting a doctor more effective, efficient, and cheaper for the patient & doctor 

‚Ä¢ Highest conviction international growth story out of all high-growth stocks. TDOC will make it easier than ever for non-Americans to have an ""American"" doctor, who are generally perceived the ""best in the world"" 

‚Ä¢ Attractive valuation trades under 16x '21 sales.

764,BP," I‚Äôm bearish on TDOC.  With most major health systems, sole community hospitals, PCP offices, etc. now fully adopting telehealth services, where does this leave TDOC for future growth?  They filled a niche during a critical period of time, but even at their most opportunistic period, they couldn‚Äôt create a positive operating margin.  I don‚Äôt know any healthcare service that can stay open on negative operating margins.

They don‚Äôt accept Medicare/Medicaid FFS according to their FAQ on the website, so that population will go to an urgent care or an established PCP.  Employer-based insurers will steer patients to in-network systems that now have comprehensive telehealth services.  PCPs will utilize disease management service through their own resources through telehealth.  The uninsured and underserved areas will utilize FQHC‚Äôs that now have adopted telehealth.  I just don‚Äôt see where TDOC fits in? 

Also, where‚Äôs the continuity of care with TDOC?  Do you see the same physicians and mid-levels time after time?  Are the physicians any good?  Is it really a good idea to rely on patients to perform vital signs of themselves (TDOC mails a BP cuff with I instructions prior to visits according to the website)?  From experience, patients are typically poor historians and frequently can‚Äôt even locate a pulse, much less take their own BP.  Mental health services are also provided by major health systems (and small hospitals - I know, because we do it) through telehealth, so that market isn‚Äôt cornered. 

Yes, telehealth is here to stay, but TDOC isn‚Äôt, at least not at these valuations.  To me, it‚Äôs a glorified urgent care.  

IMO, I think they have an opportunity to grow if they partnered with WeightWatchers to provide medical services and weight loss prescription medications for those entering their program.  Imagine a proven, researched and successful program like WW providing telehealth medical follow up and prescription weight loss meds (Saxenda anyone?) along with the behavioral components through WW 360?  THat could be a game changer for both in a population that is growing in a bad way.

The recent dip has very little to do with the CEO change and more has to do with the macro environment. There is some belief that AMZN will dip as we reopen the economy. They‚Äôre also tied up in some of the high growth tech stock rotation.

I like price to free cash flow instead which tends to range from 40-80. Right now it is at 54 which isn‚Äôt terrible but isn‚Äôt a steal either. That said, the great thing about Amazon is it is growing so fast so if the price stays constant you‚Äôll be in the 40‚Äôs by the end of the year.

So youre suggesting that the CEO transition is not a cause for concern for the average investor? at least for amazon, I'm guessing bc it's such a successful company anyway? and/or because Andy Jassy seems to be a fit replacement?

Tim Cook appeared to be a fit replacement for Steve Jobs based on his reputation, as does Andy Jassy, so just regular market motion could explain a lot.

There are 2 main sources of the shortage, first is mostly companies that favour Just In Time (JIT) procurement pushing back on foundries like TSMC at the start of the pandemic because they forecasted less demand. This resulted in TSMC/etc reallocating capacity to other sectors/customers. The most harshly affected sector by far is automotive because they are the biggest fans of JIT and don't want any surplus supply laying around so they cancelled massive chunks of fab capacity. You would think that would be bad for TSMC but there is always demand for slack fab capacity, AAPL, NVDA and AMD would have happily gobbled it all up.

The second source is Trump's banning of SMIC. SMIC is a huge foundry that supplied many - again automotive chips. With SMIC banned US companies had to try buy capacity from TSMC (which is massively oversubscribed as it's the very best) or GlobalFoundries, Samsung, etc. However with GlobalFoundries being more niche these days and Samsung also being very high in demand it suddenly got hard to fab automotive ICs on short notice after they all gave up their capacity to other companies.


So with all of that in mind MVRL didn't give up any of it's capacity, in fact they were a beneficiary of others giving up their slots as they secured more 5nm production capacity from TSMC. 5nm is a cutting edge process node and vital to their 5G chips.

858,GM," Dividends.   

Dividends are not paid out by contract like a bond.  While I would rather have dividend paying stocks than bonds any day, dividends are not guaranteed.

Ford and GM used to pay dividends.  No more.   Dividend yields used to higher back in the day.  No more.

I had a client  who was a young guy and sold his business.  He bought $800k of FNMA and Ginnie Mae preferred stocks with an 8% yield.  FNMA and GNMA were considered quasi-US Govt Agencies. So really safe right? 

 Not only did they cut their dividends to zero, the preferreds became worthless.  This all happened in 2008.  

Please don't bank on dividends being paid or being paid at any particular rate. Things change.  Dividends change.

863,INTC," Back in the day (1980's), a very respected  mutual fund company came out with that same strategy.  Instead of stocks they were using US Treasury bonds.  The concept was to sell out of the money covered calls to generate an out sized dividend that was greater than Treasury yields at the time.

As you recall, we have been in a US Treasury Bull market since 1982.  Yields generally have fallen. But there are times when yields would go up and bond prices would go down.  This is an analogy for stock prices rising but more specifically about stock prices falling.

In the case of the fund it was sold to us brokers by the mutual fund company as an excellent income vehicle for our retired clients.  And it was.  We literally poured billions into the fund on behalf of our retirees. (I am retired, not an advisor anymore.)

Here was the catch.  And one you will see on NUSI.  Both had a mandate to pay dividends.

Stocks go up:

So NUSI buys Intel for example.  Its trading around $60 per share.  Nusi writes a 65 call.  Its out of the money.  The stock goes to $80.  NUSI just makes $10 plus the call premium.  NUSI would have been better off holding the stock to $80 and pocketing the $20.

Stocks go down:

NUSI does the same thing as before.  $60 INTC, sells a 65 strike call.   Stock goes to $40.  NUSI made the premium but lost $20 on the stock.  

Here's the worst part.  NUSI still  MUST pay dividends.  Just because all their stocks are below what they bought them at, they still have to generate income to pay those dividends.  So they write another out of the money call.  With the stock at $40, they can't write a 55 strike call and get any meaningful premium.  

So they write a $45.  It's out of the money TO THE CURRENT $40 stock price.  And the stock goes back to $60.  The fund gets called at $45 and immediately books a $15 capitol loss.  

For as long as the markets stay depressed  and the call strike prices are technically out of the money, they aren't relative to the purchase price.  But they are way down from the original purchase price of the stock.

The fund gets premium income but the NAV of the fund slowly collapses as they get called for loss after loss.  You got the dividend from the fund but lost  a ridiculous percentage on the original investment.

The sad part is the mutual fund rep kept telling us, ""We  only write out of the money calls.""  When pressed, he denied they wrote calls in the money to original stock purchase prices.  But, while technically out of the  money TO THE CURRENT STOCK PRICE, they got deeper and deeper in the money to purchase price as the markets went down.

Though this mutual fund raised billions, clients eventually bailed in droves.  Eventually the fund merged with another fund to effectively disappear and was heard of no more.

I think you are forgetting the part where NUSI buys puts that would protect it from going down so much.


Best way to illustrate this is to check the NUSI chart and how it has performed during covid.... its stock only dropped 10%, far less than almost any other ETF. Why? Because it boughts puts to protect itself.

902,CD," investing is for money you plan on leaving alone for several years or more. the US market as a whole has positive growth rate over 90% of the time when you look at 5 year periods. shorter than 5 years, the volatility can be extreme. so ride it out. 

a total market index or S&P 500 fund is a good option, especially if not interested in following the day to day details.  but FYI Fidelity has lower fees than VTI or VOO. Zero fee indexes, in fact. https://www.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/investing-ideas/index-funds

as a general rule, you'll want to save cash for an emergency fund. the usual guideline is 3 to 6 months of expenses, more towards 3 months if career/income are stable and more towards 6 if your salary is commission based. this needs to be liquid cash in a boring savings account or CD, you can't afford a 30% drop in your emergency fund. 

above that, a separate savings account for any short-term needs. as a new grad you might need cash for moving expenses, new apartment deposit, etc. 

above that, another guideline is to save at least 10% of income into tax-advantaged retirement accounts like a 401k or IRA.",harrison_wintergreen,1,/r/stocks/comments/lz5xig/should_i_invest_in_only_index_funds/gpziq4d/,0.075,0.793,0.131,0.897

907,DCF," This is incorrect. The cost to maintain previous investments is maintenance Capex, which is part of total Capex. 

Depreciation & amortization is a non-cash charge on the P&L  after allocating the cost of tangible & intangible assets over the useful life of assets. Key word is non-cash charge so it needs to be added back to cash flow.

I would also discourage creating your own valuation because the market will be valuing based on traditional DCF & comparable methodologies and a different method will have a disconnected valuation and nobody will conform to you. It's like going to a restaurant and telling them you want a $100 tomahawk steak for $30 and justify it because ""you're not hungry"" ü§£.",ricke813,1,/r/stocks/comments/lz1v7x/discussion_of_free_cash_flow_fcf/gpyepaz/,0.023,0.841,0.136,0.8591
908,DCF," I saw it and it‚Äôs still wrong. The whole point of analysts is to determine whether the capex is being put to good use or not and to call out management for it. If you dive deep down into the 10-Ks you can determine approximately how much is being spent on growth and how much is being spent on maintenance. I get that you can use proxies, but you need to understand what those proxies are for. The DCF model is the last step in a valuation exercise. 95% of the time is spent analysing the company, finding what drives value and what will drive value, forecasting etc. A proper DCF valuation is not simply a plug and play exercise. If it is for you, then don‚Äôt expect the value you get to be accurate.",simonkesterlian,1,/r/stocks/comments/lz1v7x/discussion_of_free_cash_flow_fcf/gpyharq/,0.015,0.871,0.114,0.9201
909,FCF," I agree with other comments that you are looking for maintenance capex vs growth capex. Using depreciation as a proxy for maintenance capex works is a good assumption if accounting useful life is close actual useful life. In practice i find depreciation is quicker and therefore will overestimate M.Capex in the short term.

What you should be careful of is that income growth assumptions match up to growth capex assumptions. 20% revenue growth is rarely sustainable without addition investment.

Dont be put off by comments about using a non traditional approach. Long term, a companies success and value will not be determined by a Wall Street analyst using a dated valuation approach. There are plenty of ways to arrive at a FCF and discount factors- just make sure you understand what you are doing and the impact on the valuation.",wazzamata,1,/r/stocks/comments/lz1v7x/discussion_of_free_cash_flow_fcf/gpz0y83/,0.013,0.778,0.208,0.9789

934,FB, FB is pretty cheap and has been for some time. Have owned it for years and been relatively frustrated it never gets the valuation it deserves despite the earnings growth.

940,ATH," I was meaning that Company A pulled out 3 weeks ago at ATH, stock drops, next week Company B pulls out at 10$ less per share, and so on, so the later you pull out, the worse your gain is.

Maybe they all pull out in a stepwise fashion? I was imagining each downturn represented a few companies pulling out each time. A/B/C first, companies E/D/F the next week. But I guess it makes sense if they're all pulling out say 10% each week. But then I'd ask why they don't pull out more earlier to profit more. I guess they all have some magic number that they generate weekly/daily for how much they want to sell and at what price point.",jamypad,1,/r/stocks/comments/lza7ch/rotation_from_growth_to_value_stocks/gq0lgbt/,0.026,0.883,0.091,0.7171

943,DD," Your DD for leaps should be far more in depth than buying stocks because of the risks you're taking. #1 for me is killer management and if the product is a category killer (market leader in old terms).

Remember, if your underlying goes into a downtrend or consolidation you'll be losing money as time passes even if it reaches your target eventually.

That said, a lot of people have made huge money over the past year from growth stock leaps. What is unknown right know is if that market for growth stocks will come roaring back or is that done. We should know in the coming week(s). You can buy leaps for non-growth but I don't know if I'd do that.

Follow people on twitter and YT (like Davis Trades) and try to understand the tools used in option trading first before jumping in.
