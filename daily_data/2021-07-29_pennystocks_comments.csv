I'm holding long because I have trust in the progress of crypto, NSAV will be the 2nd publicly traded Crypto Exchange, not next year but next month in 2 weeks it will launch, I at least suggest you to wait for Aug 9. It has 15 times the shares as Coinbase and COIN trades for 200. You really think NSAV cant get to $1?",Kobedoe,2,/r/pennystocks/comments/otpilw/the_loungedaily_plays_july_29_2021/h6zpxyn/,0.022,0.866,0.113,0.6938

149,DD, It was up 25% but someone dumped. I feel bad for them because if you research this and look at the DD it is crazily undervalued right now. They have government contracts they haven't even announced yet because they waited to post any PR until their name change took place because ether want the success of the new management team and the new company notnto be associated with the sketchy previous CEO.,Over-Bell-3852,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/otpilw/the_loungedaily_plays_july_29_2021/h6yxqea/,0.137,0.785,0.077,-0.7227

Anyone getting into SPRT after a 100%(!) gain in a week should be very wary. Nothing to do with paper hands and the manipulation by the holders in here is staggering. Terms like that should be banned tbh.

163,XTNT," Maybe just people buying in anticipation of the approval or earnings statement then. I’ve noticed too hedge funds try to put their eggs in as many baskets as possible in the chance things for well, because they can afford to hold for recovery if things don’t go good.

165,DD," $VNUE is going to make huge gains in the next several days, weeks and months. Do your DD on this one... They have $10 Million in funding to bring Soundstr to market, make acquisitions, do a share buyback (planned by CEO), among other plans. 

Having StageIt, along with RockHouse Live and Soundstr all mixed together sounds like a recipie for success. Imagine how RockHouse Live can attact larger acts because the audience isn't just the restaurant patrons, but live viewers all over the world!!! So maybe some larger acts would enjoy doing a small intimate show for a very large audience. 

It's very easy to see a bright future for VNUE",chernchern,6,/r/pennystocks/comments/otxgdf/vnue_to_acquire_livestream_company_stageit/h6yo1j8/,0.0,0.814,0.186,0.9655
