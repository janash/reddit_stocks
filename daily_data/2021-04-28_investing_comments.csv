0,BHP," The question is what companies are the best hedge/winners in this environment?

Commodities?... Like Rio Tinto and BHP. But these are already priced accordingly.
Consumer goods?... As we read from the statements above. They already have rich valuations for small growth (P/G, Nestle and co). I don't think this would be smart.
Super markets, telcos? Like Kroger, Verizon or China Mobile there are still some value-pearls in the market. The goods they sell are in demand whatever may come. Maybe a good idea?
Medicine? Stable companies like Roche or BMY. Maybe this could be a smart way to stabilize the portfolio?

Or the risky obvious choice? Big tech like Alphabet. Their growth outpaces inflation. Their strong balance sheets give buying opportunities if the market should crash. The risk? Dependend on high growth. Interest up - > WACC up - > Valuation down. Growth down - > Valuation down.

2,USA," I am seeing inflation in my business in a few key areas:  
1, manufacturing inputs are rising, including wages for Asian workers  
2, shipping costs have went INSANE and likely will continue for 12 months  
3, consumer demand has went INSANE in the USA. This is compounding supply shortages.  
4, retail prices are/will rise between 3-5% in the next 6 months.   


If that isn't huge inflation, I don't know what is.   


The FED basically needs to slow the demand side down with tightening policy so the supply chains and get back to working in an optimal and predictable manner. Markets are not efficient right now. You've got homebuilders ramping up huge, reminds me of 2006, trying to get as much inventory on the market as fast as possible. None of this is good for business planning, or jobs, or people. We need more market consistency.   


I am really hoping today the Fed says something like ""We are reviewing some recent data points in regards to cost and price increases."" That would be enough to signal they will do what is necessary. If they keep the pedal to the floor we're really in for a massive crash. We're basically in a feedback loop right now, tightening supply, raising demand, surging prices... One has to give to find balance.",bosshax,12,/r/investing/comments/n06qet/recent_corporate_executive_comments_on_inflation/gw6gxw7/,0.096,0.856,0.048,-0.7863

11,HRC," >  steel  

HRC futures up between 37-87% through to Q2 2022. China about to announce the elimination of rebates for its steel exporters as it prepares to divert production for internal consumption. Simultaneously, it is taking highly polluting mills in Tangshan offline as it embraces pollution control and a shift to ""green steel"". If that weren't enough for the supply side, add to it reduced worldwide output due to Covid - output which cannot be made up at the flick of a switch - coupled with infrastructure spending galore as the world seeks to jumpstart a post-Covid era and what you have is the beginning of the next steel ""super cycle"". Cycle is a bit of a giveaway here by the way. Check how $MT looked back in 2008 for example, compared to now, where it's trading at a massive discount. 

Of course, it's easier to spread doom and gloom than to dig deep and investigate why something is the way it is.

I'm sure there are similar factors at play in lumber and other commodities, yet it's as though everyone has already forgotten the profound effect Covid had on the world and we're not even close to outright defeating it.

The P/E of 2.35 is insanely low but the price was falling and i suppose it will continue to fall. When would you get into GEO if at all?

I'd wait to see what happens on the next earnings call in May and see if they are still remaining a REIT. If they do and plan to continue paying dividends than this could be an amazing investment.

34,MSCI," As [skilliard7](https://www.reddit.com/user/skilliard7/) pointed out, real estate only has a beta of about 0,6. The standard deviation of a sector captures total risk, which includes both systematic and non-systematic risk (in this case sector-specific risk). Non-systematic risk can easily be reduced by diversifying. So, for a well-diversified portfolio, only systematic risk matters.

What does that mean? By itself, real estate may be relatively risky. However, in a well-diversified portfolio, where the sector-specific risk can be diversified away, only systematic risk should remain (i.e., beta). In that case, real estate could definitely outperform the market on a risk-adjusted basis. When ignoring non-systematic risk, over the past 11 years (2010 - 2020), the MSCI World Real Estate (USD) (NET) has actually already outperformed the MSCI World (USD) (NET) on a risk-adjusted basis (assuming that beta is the only risk factor), and that is true for both the arithmetic and the geometric mean return. I don't know whether this still holds in a multi-factor model. And of course the MSCI World Real Estate index isn't necessarily a good proxy for REITs, but you get the picture.",ChengSkwatalot,5,/r/investing/comments/n0k1xc/why_reits_are_in_a_position_to_outperform/gw7qqgr/,0.096,0.868,0.036,-0.7053

49,ETH," So I am using robinhood to buy some ETH but am interested in buying index funds. Now, I don't know too much about stocks and figured I would invest in S&P 500. I wanted to find out which one is the best currently I'm looking at VOO since most people say this a good one and they are pretty much all the same. At the same time I wanted to find out how can I reinvest my dividens automatically in robinhood. And do all index funds do dividend reinvestment? 

What would be the benefit of a mutual fund? What is better ETF or Mutual Fund? 

I just also learned about CDs and how esentially they work as a savings. Does robinhood let you do this? And what are the pros and cons. Can I deposit as I go? Where can I do a CD? Are they even worth if I'm doing small amounts and depositing as I go?


Lastly, should I be using robinhood, I sort of want to change to something else but don't know what has everything so simple.

53,LSI," I set aside about 20% of my salary each month to invest in stocks. I want to know your opinion on Dollar Cost Averaging vs Lump-sum Investing.

DCS sounds like a much safer option but might hurt my returns if the stocks skyrockets. LSI is much riskier but with a higher chance of making big bucks, since you know, stocks always go up and stuff. 

Let’s say I adopt DCS and decide to invest $500 at the beginning on each month, how would I divide this amount on multiple stocks? Let’s say stock A at the 1st of May is at $80, stock B at &150, and stock C is at $40. Do I buy 2 of A, 2 of B, and of 1 of C? 

Basically my question is how do I divide my initial $500 on three stocks or more given I have a limited, non-flexible amount to invest each month? 

I’m new to investing and don’t have a clear strategy, however it getting clearer that I’m mixing dividend investing with some growth stocks.",kokv19,1,/r/investing/comments/n0alci/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gw5lk86/,0.059,0.846,0.095,0.5014
54,IBKR," I have another futures related question. 

I'm looking for strategies to maximize returns in my Roth IRA.  Right now I'm doing the Hedgefundie Adventure with leveraged ETFs.  I've gotten a lot of feedback on this board that futures are a better way to do this.  I'm curious if the following strategy is a good one:

Replicating a portfolio comprised of 15% Russell 2000, 15% S&P 500, and 70% 5 year treasuries with 5X exposure using futures.  

I have about $60k in my Roth IRA, so in my Interactive Brokers Roth IRA I'd buy M2k, MES, and ZF contracts to replicate that allocation and achieve that amount of leverage.  From what I can tell, I'll be paying significantly less compared to the hedgefundie strategy by saving the management fees and potentially getting lower drag from the spread I'll be paying to roll the contracts vs buying TMF, and I can increase or decrease the leverage.  A 30/70 portfolio also has better risk adjusted returns compared to 50/50 S&P 500/30 year Tbonds.  It is hard to imagine that portfolio being margin called, even in a Roth IRA with higher maintenance requirements.  I've been paper trading with IBKR for the past several months and this seems really easy to do.  

u/hydrocyanide, u/mastercookswag, u/enginerd03 Tell me why this is a smooth brained idea and how I can do better.  Thanks!

I work for the Air Force as an E-4 so I make under 30k. 
My objective is optimal retirement savings. 
I would say I have high risk tolerance. I’m still young enough to be risky since I am single with no dependents, pets, or car payment/rent. 
I have close to 18k in ETFs spanning from VSAX and VOO to stocks such as NIO and ofc, BTC. 
I have 5k in a high yield savings. I have 6k being transferred from Betterment (roboadvisor) to vanguard. I have 6k sitting in Webull to use maybe for Ethereum and other crypto? 
I am unsure how much is in my RothTSP currently but I have been putting in 5-15% for the past five years. The allocation was 100% L2060 or something but now it’s C/S fund. 

Techically I have 18k to use and not sure what to do. Do I buy more shares of the ETFs and long term stocks I have or do I buy various crypto and increase my TSP? Thank you  x",goldenponyo,1,/r/investing/comments/n0alci/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gw6brii/,0.048,0.877,0.074,0.7688
56,AAPL," Hi all,

I am 36 years old, live in the US, employed making 148K\\year. I have a Checking, saving, 401k, Robinhood, and two 529 accounts (for my kids).

Robinhood is something I just started playing with once I realized how little my savings account was doing for me. I started putting less in my savings and started dumping money into RH weekly and have been buying some pretty big (and what I consider rather safe) stocks like TSLA, MSFT, V, AMZN, AAPL and even some ETFs like SPY, and some of the ARK's.

The main question is, should I take some of my savings, say maybe 1000-2000 and dump it into a ""safe"" (I know nothing is truly safe when it comes to stocks) or even multiple ""safe"" stocks to try and get more return on my money? This would be for purely saving, I really don't have any plans for it so I guess retirement or a future big expense we may have (house remodeling comes to mind), so the plan would be to not touch it for a while, as in years if possible. My checking and what would be left in my savings would be enough to cover me in any emergencies.

Currently have 1 credit card that has about $5k (11% interest rate). Which leads me to my next question, would it be better for me to take that 1-2k and put it towards my credit card instead of the stocks? (I still have $50k in student loans, but my parents pay those and agreed to pay them before us kids went to college.

66,OR," Hello everyone! To preface this, I am 18 years old and about to dive into college next semester (tentatively for nursing). I’ve put together a rough plan where I should be able to graduate with >$30,000 in student loans. I’ve been following Dave Ramsey for awhile and I am not too worried about my ability to pay them off.

However, I currently make about $800-1000 a month serving part-time and plan to do so through college. I have a Roth IRA and another individual account both invested in similarly aggressive mutual funds. Both have about $2k in them currently. As of now I invest about $400-$500 a month split about 50/50 between my Roth IRA and my individual account ($200 into each). 

This leads me to my question, should I continue to split my investments that way? Or should I go all into one or the other. Basically I am thinking that I could go all into Roth and let compounding interest get rolling early, OR I could stash it all into my individual account which I intend to use to pay off my student loans in about 4 ish years.

Think I am going to do this first and then only leave my CC for emergencies...which honestly that is what I had been doing now for a while.

I do have a TD Ameritrade account (my checking is TD so it was just easier) as I was looking into doing some day trading while working from home during the pandemic but quickly realized that is not for me lol. 

RH is nice because I can buy parts of a stock...any suggestions on brokerages that offer something similar with little to no costs?

My 401K is high risk, has been since I started it when I got my first job out of college. I see no reason to touch it or change that. I re-adjust as needed but for the most part just leave it alone. 

I would love to know more about your story, do you have a high paying job? Kids? How did you pay off the house by 57? Are you retired? I just want to be financially comfortable while also being able to have fun and bring the family on vacations here and there. Id love to ""semi-retire"" as in pick up a part time job after like 50-55 for extra money and be stable enough to enjoy life...I see someone like my mom and hear all the time how she is going to have to work till she's 70 and I just don't want to be in those shoes...and my parents have given me so much, that I want to be sure to give back to my kids so we all can be stable and not have to worry. 

Just so much to consider, I don't want to look back and say...dam I should have did this or that...then again, that is life and probably going to happen anyway lol.

77,CC," I retired at 51 in 2015 with 32 years of service with the state of Illinois which has a defined benefit retirement. I was making 100K per year when I retired and maxed out the plan with 80% monthly income.  

I live in Southern IL and bought my current 2000 SF home on 5 acres with a 4 car garage in 2009 for 130K. The housing market back then was in a downturn and I  received a 6500.00 federal tax credit for buying it under the Obama first time home buyer program. I took out a 10 year fixed rate mortgage and paid it off in 8 years. 

I also had a 457 deferred compensation plan that I contributed to for over 20 years with the state that was pretax. Upon my retirement I was able to roll that over to self directed. 

I took a year off after retirement and then took a position as a Case Manager for people with Substance Use Disorders that has a very flexible schedule. I make 29K a year currently and have been maxing out my wife's Roth as well as mine for the past 5 years, since you have to earn it and cannot use retirement or pensions on the Roth.  My wife is on SSI Disability with approx. 1500.00 monthly income. 

We currently are with Fidelity and you can purchase by cash amount or by shares. I really like the active trader pro they have and the support, which has been overwhelmed during the past couple months with people fleeing RH. I have heard good things about TD so you should be fine there also.

The bottom line is that I live in a rural area where the average income is 40K for a family of 4, so I was making bank compared to others in my area. 

Now I must confess that when I was in my late 20's and early 30's I did the exact opposite and lived outside my means and acquired quite a bit of debt with CC's, home improvements and vehicles. When I sold my old home I was able to break even on the CC and remodeling debt and have never looked back into the debt paycheck to paycheck world.

* Great studios are very far and few. To develop something like the Witcher series and gain such widespread critical acclaim is not easy. It takes a lot of money, talent, and momentum to be able to build such competence as a developer, that's valuable.
* Essentially CD Projekt Red benefits from being HQ'd in Eastern Europe. These games require an army to develop. Well, eastern developers are a cheap and talented army.
* The games of today are services, they are not one-off products. Cyber Punk will be improved upon, and over time the developers will hash out all the bugs and the game will improve.
* The best time to release a new IP is during the release of a new generation of consoles. It matters less whether the game is any good, the key is to make the IP a thing (one game is not the IP). As far as I am concerned, every gamer has heard of this IP now. All it takes are some critical reviews of the next installments to completely change the media storyline.

CDPR is basically only known for The Witcher series. A reputation hit hurts them significantly more than it does a firm like EA. EA has missed the mark in previous editions of Madden and FIFA, yet they continue to be the most successful sports games.

101,MGM," Good morning contrarians!

Futures are flat as of 0630. Nothing doing a day after more sideways action for major indices. Earnings results drove moves for individual stocks but there were no catalysts to shift the broader market.

Today is going to be about the Fed. The FOMC interest rate decision and accompanying statement is due at 1400 followed by the Fed press conference at 1430. Interest rates will stay where they are but it’s all about the commentary from Powell & Co.

Investors will be looking for any discussions of tapering and inflation. Last month Powell was able to convince markets (barely) that he was standing pat even with higher consumer prices. Any hint at all that his conviction is wavering will spook markets. Bonds are selling off a bit this morning, perhaps in anticipation, with the 10-year up about 130 bps to 1.64%.

We also have earnings today: Boeing, Ford, Qualcomm, eBay, and MGM Resorts during market hours. Apple and Facebook after the close.

If that weren’t enough we also hear from President Biden tonight, but that news (of higher taxes on capital gains and income for the uber wealthy) is already out, so would not expect there to be much of a market reaction to the speech. 

Earnings results have been positive and guidance mostly optimistic, including for consumer names (Starbucks raised its full-year outlook) and reopening plays (airlines are expecting better days ahead. JetBlue did so yesterday). Big picture things are probably set up for us to keep moving higher.",The_Contrarian01,10,/r/investing/comments/n0alxg/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/gw5pldd/,0.017,0.867,0.116,0.9797

They just sold their 12% stake in Qoros for 1.56 rmb which will be paid over installments. That is 240m  usd

They have 120 m in cash 

So that comes to 1.39b 

Now they own 53% of OPC energy that is trading at a market cap of 6.3B INS Which is 2b or essentially 1b to Kenon

Think of MCD/DIS as a ""micro-portfolio"" inside of a larger investment portfolio.
