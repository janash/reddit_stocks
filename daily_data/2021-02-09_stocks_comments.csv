1,BB," Chen has been the CEO since 2013, no? Hell of a time for a turnaround transformation. I'm not downplaying his credibility but trying to be objective and realistic. His contract has been renewed and he'll get \~90m if the share price reaches $30, which is a good thing as it'll incentivize him to accelerate the revival.

On the executives selling their shares, I do agree that it's really up to the individual, but it definitely doesn't signal their confidence. Steve Rai, the CFO, sold all of his shares. To be fair, if I were an executive for a public company that has been trading sideways $3-4 for years, I'd jump into selling my shares when it spiked to $18-ish myself. My guess is that the executives themselves didn't really anticipate the kind of growth and potential that's on the horizon.

I like BB as they can be considered as a growth company in the emerging Cybersecurity, IoT, and EV industries. But there's a lot more to be done, e.g., trim off the fat and laser focus on the product roadmap and development, along with aggressive selling.

5,BB," Great long term play, and lately, BB is gaining a lot of short term traction. Media is picking up BB as a good buy, and BB is also bouncing back fast after a dip related to Robinhood restricting buying, misunderstood reports of execs selling (they do this regularly), and shorts riding the wave down to make a profit, which created artificial downward pressure.

BB also got a PT upgrade from Zacks to $29 and is rated as a strong buy on most websites now

Upcoming catalysts include settlement from FB (this month), Amazon + BB conference (this month), Q4 earnings (this month), and launching of more products and revenue streams related to IVY later this year

51,BB," BB still kind of in the phone game with the OnwardMobility and FoxConn licensing deal to bring a new BB branded phone to market.  OnwardMobility has some Wireless Phone vets on its team to help ink deals with major carriers and touting the 'most' American made phone could help with some of those free Fed dollars for that type of product.

In short, yes they have some good pokers in the fire and will be interesting to see where it goes.

I think it is related to the connection to BB being a meme of sorts, to the marketing of BB as being primarily thought of as a phone company, and an unwillingness to price in future market value. I would guess that BB will slowly grow until they first come out with quarter earnings that are more reflective of a change in sales and marketing approaches and revenue streams through their different products, particularly IVY which is supposed to become more integrated later this year from what I have heard. This could mean that BB won't see a reflection in changing revenue streams until Q3 earnings, which I think are in November for 2021.

So all that being said, BB is probably looking at a few catalysts pushing price up to the 20s between now and March (FB settlement, Amazon + BB webinar, and Q4 earnings (the earnings of which I really don't know whether the will be a catalyst for an upward or downward push)), and possibly BB being as high as 30 before Q3 2021 earnings, and maybe BB will begin to assume more appropriate PTs by then, in comparison to their competitors (ie. Crowdstrike).

116,CEO," Not what you think it is, shares are a part of their salary compensation. See below:

Insider sales (particularly discretionary sales, like above) are often interpreted by investors as proof management considers the company overvalued. However, this is often a simplistic view, and not all such sales are bad.

It's also important to note that insiders sell stock for a variety of reasons, as equity is often a large part of their compensation. Additionally, while insiders have more insight into the workings of the company, they have little visibility into future market conditions and are often as bad as traders as normal retail investors are.

While the CFO having no ownership is slightly concerning, it appears this will change soon. In an email to Reuters, a company spokeswoman noted ""all of our executives continue to have strong equity-based incentives through our long-term equity program.""

Chen, BlackBerry's CEO, is heavily compensated based on stock appreciation, so if WallStreetBets continues to power the stock higher, it's likely the entire C-suite is in for a big equity payday soon.

179,BB," Ah ok. Their competitors are in multiple sectors since they have 5 or more softwares that all have different uses in applications. However, it gets tricky as you look deeper into each software, as they are used in multiple sectors as well. QNX is probably the most widely used software. It is being used as an RTOS platform for EVs, for government security software related to IoTs (artillery, planes, pcs, spaceships, etc), and for other companies' in various uses of tech. However, QNX has a wide variety of functions that it can support, ranging from driver systems, digital instruments clusters, connectivity modules, infotainment, etc, but companies are free to specialize in these categories, while building upon QNX as a secure platform (QNX is a System on a Chip (SoC)). This means that they are not trying to be exclusive to all functionalities in a system, but encourage specialization, recognizing that it would be impossible to try and make QNX satisfy each individual company with what they want to do for each component of their software system. This allows multiple softwares to be embedded into QNX, such as Android, Linux, or other softwares operating on their system. So I think that it would be incorrect to say that Android is a competitor, because they are partnered with Android in cohabitation with multiple companies in a single product. But it seems that most of the public does not understand this, for example the misunderstanding when Ford adopted Android over QNX for their infotainment system, even though they were actually still continuing to use QNX with Android built on top.

In terms of an embedded RTOS microkernel system, BB's biggest competitor is... no one? They have a business moat. Tesla right now is the only car company that I am aware of who are trying to so their own thing, using a Linux based system instead. However, designing such a system on Linux is a lot more difficult, and they have been having trouble getting certified. For instance, QNX is the only RTOS that is ISO26262 certified. Tesla has been trying to get certified for years now (not sure the actual length of time for this) and have not been able to yet. Thats a big issue, as the government will not allow autonomous EVs to hit the road until they are confident that the softwares being used will be safe in the event of a cyber attack or 'hack' of some sort. QNX recently proved its worth when none of their clients using their software were affected by the Solar Winds hack

Apple might also be working on their own RTOS, but no one knows yet whether they are doing that, or whether they might just be using BB as well.

As for QNX's other uses, they eo have competitors. Crowdstrike is the first that comes to mind when it comes to cyber security. A lot of BB's companies are newer IPOs such as Crowdstrike, and the comparison was made to those companies. Each of their competitors makes less revenue than BB (Crowdstrike at 178M while BB at 1000M revenue, although I am rounding), and yet Crowdstrike is evaluated at x7 the market cap of BB (7.7M for BB, 49M for Crowdstrike)

Yeah, that is my biggest bearish analysis with BB at the moment as well, being its revenue streams.

We actually are just starting to see that today with BB's announcement with being partnered with Motional's driverless program, and recently in their partnership with Baidu, who seem to be on the forefront of producing actual autonomous driving EVs now.

187,HRB," Here's a real world example from me. Back in early January or December I noticed HRB (H&R block) was at 17 bucks a share. Knowing tax season was coming up I figured it was a good bet that they would be above 20 by the middle of this year. I bought 2 calls for 20 strike for round about 80 cents I think for July 16 2021. They have since risen to 19 and even popped over 20 at least once since then. Now at 19 that same contract is selling for 1.70 (average between bid and ask). So if I wanted to I could sell my call for 1.7 or somewhere around there and I would make 100%+ on my original money spent. Whereas if I would have spent money on the stock I would only be up 12%. Flip side is that I didn't spend the same amount on the stocks so if you really want to make the big gains you need to spend as much as you would on stocks.  


I spent 151.32 on my two contracts, right now I could sell them for 340. Profit = 188.68  
If I would've bought 200 shares that would've cost me 3400. Sell now for 3800. Profit = 400. 

But if I would've spent 3400 on the contracts originally I could sell them now for somewhere around 7600. 

Again the downside is that if things go south you're out the money for the calls, which is why i only put in 151 bucks instead of 3400.",creamcheese742,2,/r/stocks/comments/lfuoe9/bb_is_not_a_phone_company_heres_some_dd/gmpditi/,0.014,0.908,0.078,0.9312

228,GME," Brand new to stocks after the GME fiasco. I bought in right before the Robinhood BS at 1 share for $230. It went up to $300s the next day, but I held for ""hero or zero"" memes (and still holding that one share as a ""red"" reminder not to get deep into momentum swings). $230 isn't much, and I'll eat that cost to learn that lesson and gain some clarity. Since then, I've looked at some very volatile cannabis penny stocks and have established sell rules (if I see a 20-30% profit on my original investment, I sell). So far I've thrown just a couple thousand at some of these penny stocks and I'm very happy with how I've stuck to that rule and haven't gotten greedy. Does it mean I miss the tip-top point of the daily spike?...yeah, I've sold early, but I've also avoided the big dip hitting mid morning and mid afternoon because of it. And I've walked away with approx 25% profit on every single purchase since GME.

These are volatile and I know I've gotten lucky with some of my selections, and I know I'll probably get burned on one of these soon (which is why I'm not playing with YOLO money), but having an established sell limit and how it keeps me from swinging left and right in momentum and emotion has allowed me to sleep at night. I could've made 50% on ""x"" stock if I had just kept riding the uptick, but it was already up 30% on the day...I'm selling and making $300 on the day and walking away.

I'm not in it for long term company performance and actual investing (i.e. hoping a penny stock turns into a dollar stock over a year or so). I don't have the patience for that and I'm not in the ""daily"" market for long term investment. My IRAs, mutual fund of ETFs, and my 401k are my long term strategy.

But I can easily say that since GME, I've gotten stricter and tighter and held to that 25% sell limit. I made $700 today, even though I could've held and made $1000 at the right point, but I've also seen in the last few days some of those penny stocks drop back down to my original purchase price, so I'm glad I sold when I did. 

Gotta be able to have a limit that checks your greed.

If anyone is wondering what I've played with, it is:

HITIF
NUGS
HEMP

No idea how well these will perform over long-term as they are all undergoing a recent spike, but I don't want to stress over and deal with their volatility over long-term (they very well could turn into dollar stocks), but I'm just here to scratch a little gambling itch. My long term strategy is not in individual stocks.

237,TSLA," TLDR: set some rules and let the market decide. 

I usually set stop losses at 10-15% (depending on volatility, sometimes even more) below the current trend line. That gives the stock enough room to breathe should there be a correction, but gets me out of the market goes into free fall or there’s some devastatingly bad news for the company. I then update these periodically to make sure I’m within that 10-15% window. Doesn’t really tell you when to sell, but at least takes the emotional weight out of it if the price starts tanking. The risk here is automatically selling at the bottom, but if you’re careful about your cutoffs that rarely happens, and if that bottom is in the green, who cares, you’re still cashing out with a profit. 

Another approach is to trim a bit off the top whenever your gains exceed a certain percentage. For example, every 20% gain you sell enough to convert 10% of those gains into cash. This approach only works well if you have a lot of shares, unfortunately. If you only have two shares you can’t sell 10% unless you’re dealing with fractional shares.

One final method, similar to the last but slightly different, is to recoup your principle investment once you’ve made a certain amount of gains. If you have two shares and you make 100% gains, just sell one of them. Then you’re back at your original buy in, but basically playing with free money, so you can’t lose anything. I did this with TSLA and literally don’t care where the price goes from here. Tie in the stop loss approach I mentioned at the top and I basically exit whenever the price tanks, securing those profits.

You should be able to set up all of these to trigger automatically once those percentages have been crossed.

It makes for some fun stock picking tho.

I'm in some ""speculative"" names like PLTR, a few spacs and then trading some names that are undervalued (banks are turning a nice profit of late namely). 

However, I picked PLTR and the SPACs I'm in because of their business, product and proven growth. I'm making way more money off them in the short term than I anticipated. But I bought them for the long term gains. I actually wish they were doing less well so I could load up on them some more. 

Alot of these tech/growth companies had big growth before the pandemic and it just accelerated. The fundamentals can still be there even when the stock is running way too high on valuations.

Edit: I've been in PLTR since it was $10. Love the tech and company. The valuation is way too high atm.

319,BMY," A couple things: 

1. The drug still allowed 1.31 attacks/month (compared to placebo 2.35/month. Not exactly home run drug, and will be tough to get approval from insurance depending on cost difference from other therapies cited. 

2. In high attack patients, it had less effect. In studies, this is generally a little unnerving as the selection bias is already high in phase 3s. Therefore, your run of the mill patient might see less benefit than the study. 

As someone who works in healthcare, and expensive healthcare at that (hematology), you can make a quick bucks on meds like these for a short amount of time until the next thing comes around. But the proof is in the pudding, and 1.31 attacks/month is going to get eaten alive in a quality adjusted life year (QALY) model.

327,GME," It pisses me off that healthcare, especially for such severe diseases, is this astronomically expensive. I understand, research is expensive, yadda yadda yada. Even with health insurance, half a million dollars, only a VERY SMALL minority of people make that or more in a year.

But, this is the system we live in, and I’m interested in getting into the stock market. 

$10.25 a share is low, but will it blow up like GME? Even slowly over a couple or few years?

I know to not expect another short squeeze.

I’m not expecting to get rich quick now, nor am I going to put thousands of dollars in (MAYBE with the stimulus? Or maybe at least a few hundred, probably better than buying scratchoffs LOL) but I’m still interested in the stock market now.

I may have missed out on the GME short squeeze (just woke up to the news one day, so it’s not like I would have known “STOCK” up 😆 at $4 a pop last year anyway) but GME is still what got me into this world.

I don’t feel very welcome on wallstreetbets though, I got a lot of hateful comments just for asking if or when there’d be another short squeeze to screw Wall Street and get a huge financial security head start for next year, when my financial troubles will be worse, even while living with my parents (getting dropped from their health insurance because I’ll turn 26).

Even if my current job offers decent insurance, fulltime isn’t half a living wage and the job makes me more and more miserable, and I carried a lot of misery before I even started working there.

Because it’s so easy to lose money in the stock market (or it just takes years to really grow) and the lottery, I’m more hesitant to spend any savings (got over $10,000 now, took me 4 years to save that).

Because even though I COULD win/quickly make a heavy 5, 6, efen 7 figure amount, the odds are LOW, and it’s absolutely critical I have my savings for survival. I don’t even know if my family will still be together or sticking around next year. And of course if I don’t have a better job with health insurance, I might have to pay out of pocket or the marketplace, or Medicare and I think that’s expensive.

329,VERY," It pisses me off that healthcare, especially for such severe diseases, is this astronomically expensive. I understand, research is expensive, yadda yadda yada. Even with health insurance, half a million dollars, only a VERY SMALL minority of people make that or more in a year.

But, this is the system we live in, and I’m interested in getting into the stock market. 

$10.25 a share is low, but will it blow up like GME? Even slowly over a couple or few years?

I know to not expect another short squeeze.

I’m not expecting to get rich quick now, nor am I going to put thousands of dollars in (MAYBE with the stimulus? Or maybe at least a few hundred, probably better than buying scratchoffs LOL) but I’m still interested in the stock market now.

I may have missed out on the GME short squeeze (just woke up to the news one day, so it’s not like I would have known “STOCK” up 😆 at $4 a pop last year anyway) but GME is still what got me into this world.

I don’t feel very welcome on wallstreetbets though, I got a lot of hateful comments just for asking if or when there’d be another short squeeze to screw Wall Street and get a huge financial security head start for next year, when my financial troubles will be worse, even while living with my parents (getting dropped from their health insurance because I’ll turn 26).

Even if my current job offers decent insurance, fulltime isn’t half a living wage and the job makes me more and more miserable, and I carried a lot of misery before I even started working there.

Because it’s so easy to lose money in the stock market (or it just takes years to really grow) and the lottery, I’m more hesitant to spend any savings (got over $10,000 now, took me 4 years to save that).

Because even though I COULD win/quickly make a heavy 5, 6, efen 7 figure amount, the odds are LOW, and it’s absolutely critical I have my savings for survival. I don’t even know if my family will still be together or sticking around next year. And of course if I don’t have a better job with health insurance, I might have to pay out of pocket or the marketplace, or Medicare and I think that’s expensive.

343,HAE," As someone who does a fair amount of clinical research, I have to say you should really never cross compare numbers from trials. They are almost never exactly the same with outcomes and baseline characteristics of patients. Additionally, I really don’t care about HAE at all (only leukemia (: ), but Haegarda had monthly rate of 0.3/month compared to placebo of 3.8. 

My assessment could be made without knowing Haegardas rate. The fact that patients are on average having 1.31 attacks a month is all I need to know. If they had great results, they would have reported it as a median and not an average because of a skew towards 0. 

When you’re thinking of a “home run drug” that’s going to take over an entire indication like OP is referring to, you better have some better data than beating placebo by 1.31 to 2.35 on a MONTHLY basis.",pharmacykiller33,28,/r/stocks/comments/lfrner/dd_biocryst_bcrx_treatment_costs_500k_a_pop_and/gmo2z94/,0.048,0.813,0.139,0.9292
344,HAE," Perhaps you didn’t know ...
“APeX-2 patients who switched from placebo to 150 mg of BCX7353 at the week 24 visit saw dramatic and sustained reductions in their HAE attack rate. Their mean attack rate dropped to 0.5 attacks per month at month seven and to 0.4 attacks per month at month 12.
APeX-S patients taking 150 mg of BCX7353 had similar attack control as those in APeX-2. Patients completing 48 weeks of treatment on 150 mg of BCX7353 (n=73) had a median attack rate of zero attacks per month in six of the 12 months, including month 12 (week 48).”

345,HAE," We are the only developed country without universal healthcare. Healthcare costs have been going up without translating into improved care. I get that, in our current system, the $500K gets the treatment made. It’s not great but it is what it is.

What I find more troubling are the comments in the thread saying that this disease is “too rare” to make a good investment. I understand that it’s “just math” but from what you’ve described, HAE sucks. So the factors in the equation are real people suffering who need help. Seeing it boiled down to numbers from other people in this thread is sad.

I think a system that depends on proving market profitability to help sick people is fundamentally flawed.

I know this is r/stocks and not politics so I’ll move on, but I do think it’s worth investing in causes that help people.",brujahahahaha,3,/r/stocks/comments/lfrner/dd_biocryst_bcrx_treatment_costs_500k_a_pop_and/gmpxm6v/,0.148,0.731,0.121,-0.7659

Compliance is a double edged sword. Oral seems like more compliance, but sometimes a clinic-based injection at least tells you if the patient has drug on board.

I'd be interested in funding a University or local government to experiment on whether they can do it better than private companies -- but the mechanics of running drug production are incredibly complex and it took NYC $1B to build a single subway stop so color me skeptical.

The small amounts we invest in these companies gives them access to more capital at a cheaper price which lets them invest more in research.

Why I say this, is that I am really good at breaking down trials. But in cancer, even if I find holes in the data, I will still be able to say “yes but these pros are really good” which allows me to weigh the pros versus the cons.

Do you have any idea how long it takes for a drug to be approved in Japan? You said you like revolutionary drug. Who else doesn't? My conjecture is that you determine if a drug is revolutionary according to its data from phase 3. Now you have an opportunity to work ahead of the curve. If you are not fond of orladeyo, that's fine. Please take a look at factor d inhibitor from bcrx. Use your expertise to tell if it is revolutionary.

383,TV," I would try to avoid comparing it to the likes of Netflix or Roku or even just Hulu. Although they are streaming services, those are both a different type of streaming service (on-demand vs vMVPD) and already established brands and household names. Fubo would be better compared to Hulu + Live TV or Sling or YouTube TV (at least for now, until they create their betting system. Then it'll get kinda tricky). 

The reason I found it difficult to compare them to any one company was solely for the fact that they have no competition that deals with only live broadcasting. Each of those brands has an even broader backing behind it and is not just ""live tv"" streaming.",AlbibiG,7,/r/stocks/comments/lfm1p3/fubotv_dd_first_time_making_dd_please_give_advice/gmnbipr/,0.056,0.872,0.072,0.25
384,FUBO," I've been using it since the beginning of football season. Sling lost the rights to the NFL apparently, so it's the catalyst that made me switch over. I'm sure the same happened to a LOT of people. I know Sling went ""free"" but I don't think they had the ESPN games, so that was a nope for me.

It helped that when football started, AMEX and Chase cards were giving out offers for ""3 months of FUBO and you get a credit each month for us.""

So even though it turned out to be more expensive than Sling ($85 vs $60), I got everything I needed out of Fubo for shows/football and Showtime along with a $25 credit from AMEX.

My issue with Sling was I had to bundle Orange + Blue + Red Zone. With FuboTV that was all rolled in together.

The prices aren't static either, and it's by region, so someone in a different state wasn't paying $85 for the same. I was okay with it, but I also did just cancel it until September.

Also, I did notice, I had more of a delay on Sling than on Fubo.

389,DD," I'm not too familiar with his work, no, but I did just finish watching his counter on Fubo. I get where he's coming from, and I understand the risks that he said how so many vMVPD and streaming services are not intended to turn a profit and how it won't be another DraftKings or FanDuel (I did state this in my DD that they were entering an already dominated market and won't be able to take much market share). Along with that they would have a much more difficult time getting bigger investors to help when they're hurting, but so far they've been able to weather through sports being quite literally shut down and their revenues were almost non-existent for a period of time.

I genuinely never believed Fubo would turn a profit when researching them (their estimated EBITDA is set to turn positive in 2024, but that's not exactly reliable and is a decent timeframe away), but I do believe that with the merger of FaceBank, they have a chance at being more than just a TV provider. 

My only major concern is with the leadership themselves and how unknown this company is. They seem up to the challenge and pushing forward with new ideas and broadening outside of being just one thing, but at the same time are inexperienced in this sector and I haven't noticed a sizable marketing campaign either. I can't find the survey, but something like 95% of people have never heard of it, which I'm not surprised.

The stock is up nearly 50% of when that video was recorded, and they have since made plans to acquire Vigtory along with Balto Sports, so I'm hoping that Gandler and his team are able to take advantage of what they set themselves up for. Especially with the growth they've experienced during the summer. But the shorts do seem to agree with Greenfield pretty heavily.

It was fun making this DD though, and hopefully something comes from it. I'll try my hand at some more later on when I find another company that's small and piques my interest again.",AlbibiG,8,/r/stocks/comments/lfm1p3/fubotv_dd_first_time_making_dd_please_give_advice/gmmq9rw/,0.035,0.816,0.149,0.9932

391,CC," Don’t take the short sides of contracts until you understand what happens on assignment so thoroughly you could explain it to a teenager.

Same thing for spreads. Don’t just read a guide and assume you get the max/min stuff. Be able to explain the four basic verticals and what you do upon short side expiration for all four ( bull/bear call/put verticals).

Really understand how each of the four spreads works to accomplish it’s goal.

Finally, understand pin risk. Know that options can be exercised after hours. Understand what that means for your “guaranteed” spreads and get how to prevent nasty surprises.

Until everything I wrote makes sense only buy naked puts/calls or sell covered calls. Do not venture into spreads that have steps of assignment in covering ( poor mans CC, regular verticals) until you get all this.

It’s not hard if you take the time. Also, spend some time reading threads on WSB of idiots who didn’t get these concepts. Figure out why their account blew up. Ask yourself what their plan was and what they didn’t understand. Learning from other people’s idiocy is a great teacher. **Don’t look at the gain threads**, those guys usually won by buying naked long calls/puts, frequently with ridiculous risk ( short expiry). Not much to learn there - same concept as buying a scratch off lottery ticket.

397,RH," Yes - until you deeply understand how these things can be handled when assigned, you should only be buying naked calls, naked puts, or covered calls. 

IE you shouldn’t be on the short side of anything that isn’t automatically resolved without risk ( covered calls are straightforward since your shares will simply be removed and money deposited).

Obviously, better to wait to buy anything before understanding but jumping in and buying naked call/put contracts is fine to my mind as you’re only risking the money you spend. **do close them before expiration, though**. Though if you’re on RH it will do this automatically.

From watching all the hype-trades pan out as you'd expect, I learned from my mistakes. I started focusing my ADHD fueled binge-researching skills on investment techniques and how value is determined, and I've gotten back my losses by making better decisions and a bit more knowhow in how to time markets, inflection points, and trends. I've also gotten out of WSB and moved over to this sub to get a glimpse of how serious due diligence is done by serious people who see potential in any given opportunity/ equity/ what have you.

I'm still learning as my odyssey at this point is only a month or so old, but I'm hooked and love the resources and insights that so many far more knowledgeable personalities give on this sub, and how I don't see newbies like myself chastised or discouraged from wanting to learn more on this community.

What are some insights you've learned as to how to organize and prepare for how to invest on any given week, or do research on any new additions to your portfolio?",jackp0t789,10,/r/stocks/comments/lg32sd/dont_over_consume_info_guyz/gmpa1jc/,0.107,0.804,0.09,-0.2611
409,DD," Insights I’ve learned from organizing - it’s easier to keep track of any trades or any of my potential gains/losses + easy to update the stats at market close, easy to correlate which companies may work together, and easier to keep note of sec filings/big trades. Excel worked for me because of the layout. (All my initial stocks from may tripled & it was easy to track them with excel for when I did options) 

Preparing on what/how to invest in: I’m mainly just sticking to my gut feelings and DD. If I see a stock getting gov funding or something like that - I keep my eyes out for those. & I also enjoy penny stocks as well. Occasionally I’ll do a bit of charting but I don’t spend much time on it.

as someone stated in his rules :   
paper hands are green hands. never get too greedy. if you are up by 10-20% , there´s no shame at all in cashing out. in fact most of the time it might even be smarter to do so.   
OR at least adjust a stop loss to protect your 15% .   
it really is an awesome feeling seeing an ginormeous and green portfolio.

1. Kopin announced 2 new medical partnerships in the last month. They also debuted a new headset with Panasonic - a MAJOR player.

2. They already have ongoing military contracts with the USA for producing AR helmet for F fighter jet pilots.

3. Before fall of last year, KOPN stock was pretty quiet. Then, it started moving -- a couple months before, and then all while #1 happened.

AR tech is priming itself for a general release for consumer tech.  The rumors about Apple's headset are very, very interesting.  It's mayyyyyyyybe possible that apple could be a forthcoming partner.  That's speculative.

619,GME," I disagree with some of the input you've received here. I think your $100 is plenty to start investing/trading with. It's enough to let you learn the fundamentals and develop an approach that suits your tolerance for risk. 

I think starting out with some diversity in penny stocks is much wiser than going all in on anything. When your whole nut is tied up in one stock, you're really just gambling and you're inclined to make emotional decisions. When you're diversified, having any one stock jump or drop doesn't make or break your financial situation, so it doesn't produce as intense of an emotional reaction and lets you stay more analytical. 

A lot of people will advocate having an ""exit strategy"", and that's good thinking. But I prefer to exit in small steps. If something you've got gets really volatile or jumps very quickly, pull out your principle. That way you can't lose money, but you're still in the game (I wish somebody had told all the GME noobs this). 

Keep some cash in your account. If something you've got drops precipitously, buy into the dip so your averaged price drops and increases your chance at a profit. 

Good luck to you.",charlieblue666,2,/r/stocks/comments/lfxpjr/rstocks_daily_discussion_technicals_tuesday_feb/gmpw2ei/,0.028,0.845,0.127,0.9644

676,AI," Oh yeah, you’re 100% on point with this. You’ve done a great job describing the competition, but you’re actually underselling the complexity here from a data and programming standpoint. 

Factor in that a lot of these bots aren’t simply algorithms that take in numerical financial data like trend lines, differentials, and fundamentals, but also automatically analyze the news using a $10k+/year Bloomberg terminal, and you’re talking about *very* complex machine learning/AI algorithms that needs to integrate natural language analysis and complex, multivariate, non-linear mathematical functions, to filter out noise and arrive at a reliable decision. Not only that, but this bot has to be efficient enough, and you have to have good enough processors to come to a solution quickly enough to execute an action before the data is stale. 

And you might ask, “Why do I need a $10k/yr Bloomberg terminal? Why can’t I just analyze all the news sites on the interwebs?” Well the answer to that is *all news is on a 15 min delay, except the stuff that goes to traders though terminals.* So by default, you’d be using stale data by trolling the web. 

Framed this way, you’re easily talking tens if not hundreds of thousands of dollars for startup costs, likely a team of clever programmers/mathematicians/data analysts, and a decent amount of training time before you’ve got something functional.

680,CRSR," ""Sell the news"" is used by a lot of people to jump in when they think the stock has reached a peak and will not go any higher for the immediate future. For a lot of day traders and short term investors, it is a strategy they like to employ a lot. Also a bunch of pump and dumpers use it too. For something like Corsair Gaming, people had an inkling from all the reports that this earnings would be the best they have had ever. They also had an inkling from the news that they reduced their debt too. So they felt for the immediate future, it is best to sell right at or after the earnings report because that will be the highest CRSR will be for the immediate future. The long term investor feels CRSR will have a new high by the end of the year or next 2-5 years, but for short term investors and pump and dumpers, that is way too long to wait.

An example of this, you may see, will be this week with SPCE (Virgin Galactic) as they should be launching their second trial to the moon. If the news is good, then there will be a jump and a substantial dip as people will sell high and hope to buy back in at a later time. If the news is bad, then there will just be a dip. So people will either sell the news on friday right before the trial to get out while ahead, or sell the news on Tuesday (Monday is a holiday) after the trial and just reap profit.

One thing to keep in mind is, you will never go broke if you always are selling on profits. You may miss out on returns (example: TSLA when it went to $400 instead of now at $800) but you will not go broke as you will always be making profit.

Your example of TLRY, the good news is nice but it isn't the ""news"" that people are waiting for. The ""news"" people are waiting for is the merger with Aphria.

702,RKT," > low P/E ratio is very attractive   

It has an extremely high P/E. I'm seeing 499.50 on Yahoo Finance and 277.18 on finviz. Neither one of these is considered ""low"" by any *reasonable* definition. The forecast P/E of 11~ is outdated/old.           

Plus you keep throwing around ""intrinsic value"" (and referencing Buffett) but nothing in your OP makes me think you even know what the term refers to nor have you tried to calculate the intrinsic value of RKT. I can see RKT being a good value investment at a certain stock price, but at the current stock price you're not value investing, you're investing in it as speculation/growth stock **which is absolutely fine** but you keep description it in terms of *value investing*.   

If you believe this is a value investment **show your work**, because I'm seeing a stock with a P/B of 127.18 and a P/E of 277.18+, Debt/Eq of 89.12. That isn't a value investment because it isn't under-valued, arguably over-valued.    

edit: Sorry I interrupted the confirmation bias/circlejerk. There's no point talking about individual companies on here anymore, people just shill for whatever they already have regardless of merit. Nobody hitting the little downvote arrow has an answer for poor P/B, high P/E (not forecast, **current**), or high debt (long & short).

I am assuming that you read the Seeking Alpha article, if that is an improper assumption please let me know. In the SA article the author frames it as you said, that most LN patients are female and Latino or African American and may not have access to health insurance.  After reading the NCBI, no doubt where our author got his info, it becomes clear that a bit of editorializing occurred. The data indeed shows that there is a higher ratio of LN in female to male (8:1) and that there is a greater prevelance in black and hispanic ethnicities. HOWEVER, it is noted that the frequency is noted AFTER adjusting for socioeconomic factors. 

The rate of uninsured adults in minority ethnicities has been steadily decreasing since ACA, and women have a higher rate of being medically insured than men. 

It would seem that the way the SA article framed it would not be terribly dissimilar than saying ""Ritalin is prescribed for ADHD, most ADHD patients are under 18, kids don't have health insurance."" They are all stand-alone facts but lend a false impression.

715,CEO," The post recommended by u/BootyliciousBrian is a good one

A good DD needs numbers to back up any hypotheses. Without solid numbers that are taken from a companies spreadsheet or other factual data, who's to say the person sharing the 'DD' knows anything at all. I've seen a lot of people across the investing subreddits who will boldly make claims about how a company is worthless or worth far too much without backing up what they say. Qualitative expositions from sites like Motley Fool or Forbes are not going to cut it. Unless there are hard numbers to back it up, consider it 'noise', as it is said in the market. There are also lots of users that will tout some special title, such as 'working at a competing company' or 'having a friend who is in the industry', following up by making some claim that is rather contrarian or extra bearish or bullish, but not providing any evidence of the claim (often if you visit their profile and see their comments and posts on other subs, you'll find that more than likely this person who claims to work at a competing company or something of the like is actually probably a 16 year old high school student, or something similar).

The point is, data backs up arguments. A good DD needs sources. Numbers from the companies' balance sheet, announcements from the company listing new partnerships or plans for the future, interviews with the CEO or execs talking about products, data from different SEC required forms, such as form-4s, 13Ds, 10Ks, etc.

I do not invest in a company without seeing some data (numbers!) to back things up. No one knows how the market will change in the future. But numbers can trends related to numbers can make accurate predictions for that company. (I am using numbers in a very elementary manner here, ie. we're talking about numbers like revenue, liabilities, P/E, CAGR, etc)

A good DD should make predictions based on the data found, however. Data has to be interpreted. This is the part of the DD for your opinions based on the (sourced!) data you have found. Do you think that the last year of quarter reports indicates that the company is experiencing extreme growth? Provide an estimate for the next quarter or from a year from now. Extrapolate the data and give a PT that sounds reasonable. Learn about different fundamental analysis, such as an SOTP analysis and how to provide an estimate based on that data for a PT.

How will the companies' market cap change through new innovations, business strategies, or management changes? I can't tell you how dull some people are on Reddit when it comes to understand the implications of management reform. Most people do not know who is on the board of directors for a company, and some don't know the companies' CEO or read about them. Good DD digs deep into a companies' history and management and finds something new that they learned about the company. Good DD also is not afraid to find things that are negatives, or bearish content for the company. Perhaps you find that your companies' CEO is actually 100 years old and refuses to believe in the internet. Yikes. Stranger things have happened in business management.

Good DD borrows from others. Particularly on Reddit. There are many investing subreddits. You should visit all of them and see what everyone has to say. If your company isn't talked about much, consider making a DD that uncovers just some information about the direction of a company. This will become a resource to many as they seek to validate your DD, and hopefully will one day contribute to the learning as well.

There are a few problems inherent to insurance that LMND is going to need to sort out before they transform into a real P&C player.

1) no one really gives a shit which insurance company they have. sure, it's nice to know that part of my premiums go to charity at the end of the year, but ultimately if lemonade doesnt stay SUPER competitive on rates for a very long period of time they will not compete well. if company A charges $1k for home insurance and lemonade charges $1500, I can easily go with company A and give $400 to any charity i want and still come out ahead.

2) LMND is not a software company, they will need to heavily scale their workforce and expand their offerings. At the end of the day, the backbone of insurance is it's claims department.  There have been some improvements to automating and efficiency, but we're no where close to turning claims into software.  therefore, for LMND to justify a huge jump in value, they will need to drastically grow in market share. if they grown in market share they will need to quickly scale up a claims department WHILE executing perfectly.  It is very hard to keep claim costs in line with a brand new claims department.  if they cant keep claim costs in line premiums go up and see point 1. 

3) LMND market cap is ~$8.4B this morning. they have about 1.5% of the home insurance market share (and doesnt offer auto insurance).  Contrast that with Progressive which is the third largest P&C carrier in the US and has a market cap of ~$50B and is spitting off cash extremely quickly.  For LMND to even 10x from it's current point they will need to become the largest P&C carrier on the planet. See points 1 and 2.

Edit: I think I first bought right around the same time as you, maybe a little earlier around $65 or $70. I’ve shored up my position a bit so I’m averaging around $105/share.

IMO opinion AMC has nothing to offer. During this pandamic we saw movie studios experimenting with bringing movies to the people at home instead of cinema's and guess what ... it worked pretty well. This is a trend that won't go away. It won't be applicable to every movie but it will be done. -> This means that every cinema has lost market share to homeviewing and I think it will only get worse. Few simple reason for not going to a cinema:

&#x200B;

1: Distance/Planning

2: People want comfort: your own environment, maybe watch a movie in bed or chill on the  couch with your own foodies and drinks, some weed wtf knows etc etc.

3: Technique has so much improved, amazing TV's and soundsystems that are of equal or better quality than the cinema's.

4: No fucking annoying people talking or checking their phone. No people sitting with a 1M square head in front of you etc etc (I hate to pay €13 for a ticket for a movie and this kind of shit happens).

Another reason to cash out is the money invested cannot be used (it's tied up). Yeah sure with a margin account it does not matter that much but still, it is unused money that could get a ROI if invested in something else. At this point you are just hoping it will go up again and probably don't want to sell it for that reason. It must hurt because I sometimes even get upset over a few €  so I can't imagine how this must feel for you or many others but knowing when to take your losses is also really important. 

People saying that if you don't sell a stock you don't lose are ignorant. You lose money everyday by not reinvesting in something that actually has potential. Sure AMC can go up again to maybe $8-$9 as it has become a meme stock but currently there are so many better opportunities than hoping it will hit that again (and you will still have an incredible loss at that lvl).

However, weed companies did good during the coronavirus so it might not dip a lot again, unless there is a market downturn that brings it with it.",EducationalGrass,3,/r/stocks/comments/lg8ou2/tlry_short_interest/gmq2omw/,0.03,0.839,0.131,0.9078
834,APHA," This is my opinion.  I bought TLRY and APHA in November. I bought APHA because of their purchase of Sweet Water Brewing and it positioning itself to enter the US market if legalization occurs (even if that only means financially).  I bought a bit more in TLRY shortly after that (December) once the merger was announced.  I've been holding TLRY ever since, but today I chose to sell my total equity in TLRY.  Here's why, the options chain for puts over the next few weeks is all below the $40 price target.  This mean all the put option holders are currently out of the money so in my opinion we saw a covering happen this morning that pushed the stock higher.  Of course that was fueled by the UK announcement.

Either way, there's likely still some option holders that want to cover their positions (if they haven't already) or waiting for a decline to be back in the money. For the majority though, I think the squeeze was realized this morning at $40, which is why it's having a hard time going any further above 42 & 43.  I think though that some are still bag holding at the $40 target and waiting for a price decline to cover.  I believe this is going to give a floor for a little while which will allow for new options contracts to be opened.  But the current volume at the $40 level isn't that high.

APHA however is now even further apart in price from TLRY, so at the current price conversion 0.838 when the merger happens, APHA has a 52% premium over TLRY.  A lot can happen between now and the merger but I think APHA still has room to move up and has a big premium over TLRY based on the merger.  For those reasons I chose to move my TLRY investment today fully into APHA.",calipfarris01,7,/r/stocks/comments/lg8ou2/tlry_short_interest/gmq5vq7/,0.005,0.975,0.019,0.4939

878,USA," I think partially it is what you are saying. I also think it is a little different in the sense that many of the ones on the list are more geared toward lithium mining rather than the actual battery production. 

&#x200B;

One of the issues with battery production is that China has historically dominated battery production. However, with the increased trade tensions with China, it puts the aspect of an electric future of Canada and America in a fairly precarious position - at the whim of Chinese manufacturing. For instance, if trade negotiations with China went sour, a situation akin to the OPEC crisis could happen with companies that rely on batteries made in China for their production line. I think this will lead to Canada and the USA to produce more batteries domestically as to not be at the whim of China.

&#x200B;

Further, battery production is difficult and intricate. I think Electovaya's longevity and patents make barriers to entry for other businesses relatively hard (not impossible, but harder than other industries)",UsuallyOptimisticGuy,1,/r/stocks/comments/lgaxys/sleeping_giant_in_batteries_electrovaya_inc_efl/gmqu97i/,0.043,0.94,0.017,-0.5423

And whenever testing new markets, I typically had to take losses to figure out how best to market to them before making profit on advertising.

This kind of disruption could be disastrous for FB. I never advertised with apple, but I'd think if the costs were equal and FB has all this ambiguity, I'd definitely go with apple. Especially as their users tend to have more disposable cash.

This all builds trust with customer and will likely grow faster than any other igaming company. But this is also a downside as customer acquisition is very expensive.  

Penn on the other hand is limited by growth outside barstool but their customer acquisition costs is very little, causing higher margins.

922,EPD," I was talking to a guy tonight who brought EPD (Enterprise Products Parters) to my attention. They have a bunch of pipelines that allow oil and gas producers to get their products to refineries. They trade at a little over 10 times earnings (10.44). This means if they make the same money every year, they will have made enough money to cover your investment in about 10 years. For comparison, it would take Tesla 1300 years to pay back your investment, and Amazon 80 years. I like the price you would pay for EPD a lot better. 

Out of their earnings, they are returning most of it to shareholders as dividends. Dividend yield of 8.2%. This is the kind of stock you can sit and hold for a long time. It won't make you rich, but is a solid, well priced investment.

There are a lot of stocks out there like this. Low growth. Just throw off dividends for a long time. These are what I consider ""investment"" stocks. Most stocks people pump on the internet are more what I would call ""betting"" stocks.

It’s not going to get you rich overnight, no way - but it’s worked well for me. I did exit my position not long ago for more risk/reward approach.

931,BSQR," Sorry, don't know. Chartology will probably be releasing a video this evening about today and where the trends might go.

It could be that you bought in a bit high, but buying on a stock that's trending up isn't necessarily a mistake.

It's up to you, do you think the stock is worth more than that? Did you just buy to try and catch a peak?

Would you feel comfortable cashing out at a loss, rather than risking losing more?

Just because you've lost money on it already doesn't mean you should try and wait to make the money back, it can be tempting to hold onto something for too long hoping for it to go back. That said, sometimes it's worth not being concerned about an initial if you believe the stock will keep increasing.

I can't give proper guidance on any of this I'm afraid. It's up to you whether you want to cash out or stick it out. Chartology as I said seems to be doing some pretty good vids, I only invested based mostly off his analysis and a minor amount of extra research. Also remember it's always possible to sell off your shares and buy back in another time.

It's difficult to time peaks and dips, so it can be worth having your money in something you believe has a consistent increasing value with solid foundations rather than something volatile. Again it's on you as to what you want to do.

Personally I'm only putting a small percentage of my overall stock investment into volatile stocks like BSQR, and most of it is in funds or much more stable stocks. But that may not be best for what you're looking for either.",ecklcakes,1,/r/stocks/comments/lg62ql/bsqr_does_anyone_know_anything_about_this_company/gmpyjkc/,0.067,0.796,0.137,0.9658

951,BB," It was a meme stock so people are a bit worried about it for the immediate future. It is a long term hold, you just have to wait it out... The problem with BB is that although there are a lot of good news about it, it is a company that NEEDS partnerships. It CANNOT thrive by itself. You will not see much movement on it unless there are partnerships with big companies coming up with it. It had the partnership with Amazon but that happened pre meme stock so that won't be a driving force any longer. It is a stock that desperately needs news/large partnerships or will just stick to the range it is at.

I believe it is around where it should be price ranged at the moment, may even be a little overvalued as I think it is better in the $10-12 range. But it has a lot of growth potential because what it offers is really useful for other big companies",tomackze,13,/r/stocks/comments/lg9c44/serious_question_about_bb_wth_is_wrong_with_it/gmq46rz/,0.041,0.871,0.088,0.8397
952,BB," I have a few reasons.

1) Look at the size of the float for BB. It's frickin huge. 500 something millions shares in the float. This means that retail investors are not going to have a strong impact on the stock price. We (Redditors and others) can be hyped as well want, but ultimately it is going to need to be institutions moving with us in order to affect that stock price a lot.

2) BB Marketing -- it kind of sucks right now. Things are spread on Reddit, but when it comes to the average person, BB products are sold to companies, not individuals. We are not their target market, so it should in a way make sense that retail investors don't really understand what is going on with BB, nor do they understand that BB has evolved into a different sector of the market

3) Revenue streams -- Blackberry is a turnaround company now that has spent much of the last 8 years or so developing software, and more of the last 3-4 years focusing on customer acquisition. BB is focused on their own business plan, and as much as we would like for them to focus on sales and becoming the GOAT company or whatever, I am certain they have a time-line as it comes to marketing, sales, and revenue streams. They have been excelling at securing huge market shares in security and the EV market; this year or next they will begin focusing on new revenue streams in IVY and in autonomous vehicles as they begin to hit the market, along with more EVs in general.

4) The memeness doesn't help. More than likely, WSB was really just played by larger institutions to take some of their money by using the hype around the stock to their advantage. The good news is that BB is highly publicized now (at least on Reddit) and this will only grow, particularly as more is revealed in relation to BB's parnerships, escpecially with that of Amazon and Baidu.

Ultimately, I believe that institutions are waiting to see better YoY or QoQ growth with BB. I would expect this to start changing as early as November of this year for Q3 up to EOY 2022.

I believe the balance sheet of BB is a big issue for some investors. They have all these clients, but based on these partnerships, their revenue should actually be much higher, so as long as people don't understand the revenue streams, it can be viewed as risky, because you are essential buying into future market value.

For instance, this TimeRemove guy has demonstrated one key misunderstanding of the market. The 'insider activity' he is referring to is execs selling stock of the company. However, this happens regularly on-prescheduled intervals and is not bearish at all. Its an indicator that he doesn't know the market as well as he appears to display it. Don't trust everyone on the internet, not even me. But numbers are trustworthy. Follow facts not opinions!

edit: also note that for competition, TimeRemove generically says that for BB DD, no one mentions competitors, but offers no competitors nor facts to speak of. Crowdstrike is a competitor, kind of, for the IoT market. But BB is highly diversified, and their products meet multiple needs across multiple sectors. QNX, for instance, is used in the IoT market, but is also used in the EV market, in which Crowdstrike is not a competitor. I challenge you or TimeRemove or whoever to find another embedded RTOS microkernal system out there that can compete with QNX. Please, try and find one. I'll wait.

978,BB," No, I meant for BB execs who recently sold its not a bearish indicator. The amount sold by the execs is not out of the ordinary in quantity than previous times that they have sold off some BB shares for some liquidity. If the quantity of shares was vastly larger than expected, then it would be reason to worry. Recently, some people picked on the CFO selling off what appeared to be a lot of shares, when really they were just selling off all their shares in a different exchange

VxWorks has its hand in a small part of the EV market, as well as in IoTs. They are used in Toshiba, Bosch, Hyundai, Magneti Marelli, BMW, Siemens, Renault, and Volkswagen. BB is also partnered with or used in Bosch, Hyundai, BMW, and Volkswagen.

If you took the time to actually look at the link posted (I am OP, and this was cross-posted in wsb, stocks, bb_stock, and stockmarket), you would actually see the vast number of partners that BB has compared to VxWorks. In terms of the EV market, if you do not include the overlapping partners or clients, that leaves BB with a 31:4 ratio in terms of market share, just in terms of quantity of partners. While VxWorks is considered a competitor, they are vastly inferior when it comes to market share in the EV market and in government security. For IoTs, this sector is much more competitive, and I don't have the stats on market share for BB compared to other companies. 

AOSP is not used in the EV market at all, although it is used for IoTs. There are multiple reasons why AOSP cannot compete with QNX in this market yet, but some reasons include certifications, problems with the kernel and embedded systems, and underdeveloped if not developed at all, RTOS systems.

Linux has its own issues as well. Tesla is trying to create a system that runs on Linux for their cars for the future of autonomous driving EVs and have been having a hard time getting certifications passed. It is unclear whether they will succeed at developing a software that is secure for these purposes. I have not been able to find any EVs that use Linux as their primary OS system aside from Tesla, but if there are, please let me know and I'll try and tuck that information away

To your third point, when 61% of the market uses QNX in their EVs, that doesn't make BB an EV company, no that was never said, but they are involved in the EV software market. Again, visit my link to see all of their partnerships",UncleZiggy,2,/r/stocks/comments/lg9c44/serious_question_about_bb_wth_is_wrong_with_it/gmqldo5/,0.035,0.891,0.074,0.8978
979,EV," No, I meant for BB execs who recently sold its not a bearish indicator. The amount sold by the execs is not out of the ordinary in quantity than previous times that they have sold off some BB shares for some liquidity. If the quantity of shares was vastly larger than expected, then it would be reason to worry. Recently, some people picked on the CFO selling off what appeared to be a lot of shares, when really they were just selling off all their shares in a different exchange

VxWorks has its hand in a small part of the EV market, as well as in IoTs. They are used in Toshiba, Bosch, Hyundai, Magneti Marelli, BMW, Siemens, Renault, and Volkswagen. BB is also partnered with or used in Bosch, Hyundai, BMW, and Volkswagen.

If you took the time to actually look at the link posted (I am OP, and this was cross-posted in wsb, stocks, bb_stock, and stockmarket), you would actually see the vast number of partners that BB has compared to VxWorks. In terms of the EV market, if you do not include the overlapping partners or clients, that leaves BB with a 31:4 ratio in terms of market share, just in terms of quantity of partners. While VxWorks is considered a competitor, they are vastly inferior when it comes to market share in the EV market and in government security. For IoTs, this sector is much more competitive, and I don't have the stats on market share for BB compared to other companies. 

AOSP is not used in the EV market at all, although it is used for IoTs. There are multiple reasons why AOSP cannot compete with QNX in this market yet, but some reasons include certifications, problems with the kernel and embedded systems, and underdeveloped if not developed at all, RTOS systems.

Linux has its own issues as well. Tesla is trying to create a system that runs on Linux for their cars for the future of autonomous driving EVs and have been having a hard time getting certifications passed.

You’re buying a contract for a call which is for the right to buy 100 shares of said stock at a given price on a certain date. 

Example: I bought a PSEC $7 call 2/19 for $0.02 x 100 so $2 total. 

Now, I can hold it and either sell the call before 2/19 or exercise it on 2/19. 

If I exercised it I would have to buy 100 shares at $7 = $700

1026,TD," I recently started getting into options myself and I highly recommend going through some YouTube videos from experienced traders and take notes.

There’s a lot of great resources on other subs too like r/options or r/optionsonly 

As far as myself I have a small amount in an etrade account and I look at charts on companies who’s stocks are trading under $10 (otherwise a single call option or put option can cost $75-$150 because you’re purchasing more than one share on a single option, a lot more actually) 

So yeah check out resources like Stocktwits, Seeking Alpha, or Yahoo Finance, and use tools like TD Ameritrade’s Think or Swim to study charts

And I cannot stress enough the importance of going through other subs or going through numerous YouTube videos to understand how options work and what methods to use and what to look for when it comes to charts and the financials of a company 

It’s overwhelming at first and takes a lot of discipline and requires dedicating a few hours a week and lots of studying but doing all this well set you up for success

You can blow up a $100, or $500, or $1000+ account in a matter of days, weeks, months by investing in options without the proper knowledge and understanding

Then again you can scale a $100 to $1000 account into a 5 figure account in less than a year by making smart, well timed option plays, regardless of how the market is doing",lavinshaven58,2,/r/stocks/comments/lfwc8e/trading_options_vs_stocks/gmo8fhe/,0.0,0.86,0.14,0.9819
1027,BAC," Just to give you an example of how I like to use them...

I saw last week some UOA in BAC April 36 calls. Bank stocks are on the move and BAC is doing a buyback thru the end of march. I think that's a great trading opportunity to buy calls as a trade over the next 3 months. 

I'm also super bullish on CLDR. I cashed in some profits last week on the stocks but I'm still bullish. I used those profits elsewhere and don't have the capital to maintain my position. So I'm going to buy some May 20 calls to keep a position where I can stay bullish and rebuy in the future if I'm right. I know in May I'll have the capital to come exercise those options if they are profitable.",lloydgross24,1,/r/stocks/comments/lfwc8e/trading_options_vs_stocks/gmpvxtj/,0.0,0.865,0.135,0.946

1029,TDOC," It works until it doesn't. For example, if you followed ARK's  purchases, like Unity (U), you would've bought the stock at $150 before it's earnings; in which afterwards, it tanked. There are plenty of other examples as well. ARK bought TDOC before the announcement of their acquisition of Livongo, they bought at $250 and TDOC's price fell all the way down to ~$170. It's only just got back up where it is now, it was down for around 3 months.

If you believe in ARK buy the etfs, following their transaction is not fool proof and it can leave you bag holding",pearli,13,/r/stocks/comments/lfvgni/buying_arkk_underlying_stocks/gmo37pm/,0.011,0.922,0.067,0.7009
1030,NAV, The price of the ETF isn’t “frenzy-boosted”. ETFs trade based on the NAV. You are trying to fix what isn’t broken.,angelus97,4,/r/stocks/comments/lfvgni/buying_arkk_underlying_stocks/gmo4t2q/,0.134,0.866,0.0,-0.4767
1031,NAV," From my understanding NAV isn't the only factor that plays into an ETF's price; you have to also consider supply and demand. If ARKK starts performing below the ludicrously lofty expectations reflected in its current price, people will begin to sell their ARKK, even if the underlying stocks are still performing fine by all accounts. The underlying stocks aren't exposed to the same risk as it's possible the majority of them aren't quite as overvalued/demand-heavy as ARKK is.

1035,BB," From what I took away from the article is that indeed BB is down 52% from their yearly high. That is because during the GME wave, BB was pushed all the way to $28, but plummeted when the shares were set to “sell only” and investors were left in the dark about why. Overall they are up 73% for the month.

A big thing holding BB back is their earnings from their past years, but within the past few months they acquired some great deals including a partnership with Baidu, Amazon, and now Motional which defies the logic of the stock continuing to go down from here.

I can’t speculate what their earnings will be, but it seems they are just ramping up now, hence why their stock is in the teens and not where their competitors are at. Nobody knows for sure if it will be a success, but there are indicators that their valuation will be a bit more fair (which is modestly around $25) with all the traction they are gaining. This is just my bias opinion listing the positives though.",gochugrande,5,/r/stocks/comments/lgcxfc/bb_and_motley_fool/gmqofgh/,0.008,0.842,0.15,0.9843

1037,BB," You have to realize that BB is a bit of a gamble (I'm long myself).  There's a lot of potential there but it remains to be see whether they will be able to realize the potential.  That's why analyst projections are all over the place.  On CNN Money the analyst 12-month price targets range wildly, from $4.50 to $20.00.
