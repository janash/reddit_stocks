- wheat, beans, agricultural products are still all significantly lower than they were in the 2008-2015 period and inflation was pretty much the same rate back then as it is now. 
- the price of sugar is still 20% cheaper than it was in 2017. 
- cocoa is basically at an all-time low and not increasing 
- lumber prices are basically half it is now than the period back in 2010-2015 housing boom
- the price of aluminum, zinc, nickel and other metals are all basically the same price it was in 2018

Work out if that has anything to do with the situation.

There is always interest to pay on top of that debt, naturally, 

No part of the debt is repaid. Some of the interest is repaid.

So the percentage of the yearly **interest** to be actually PAID for the year, is voted in each US financial budget.  
The interest payment is never close to 100% of the yearly interest. The remaining unpaid interest for the year is added to the total offshore debt.   
And <I guess> the interest actually paid out of the USA yearly, is paid in US government Bonds

147,USA," It could be an issue over the next few years perhaps. What I wouldn‚Äôt be worried about is a Weimar type event playing out here is why. First and foremost, if the world is experiencing similar inflation, it won‚Äôt become unlivable in the USA, USA is too big to fail in terms of tech/trade/wealth and in terms of military strength.

More importantly though, the long term trend is EXTREMELY deflationary. The tech we use that continues to replace workers is deflationary. Our aging boomer population is incredibly deflationary as opposed to what happened in the 70s. Did you know an estimated 20 million boomer households would have to pass on wealth just for these younger generations to be able to afford their assets at current levels? So we may experience short term inflation pain, especially if the Fed starts tapering bond purchases (inverse logic because the Fed buying bonds puts more money in to financial markets and increases the wealth gap). So when the fed buys bonds as they‚Äôve been doing for years that has been a deflationary force also.

My summary of all of this being yes we are highly susceptible to a big inflation move and it is likely in progress esp if the Fed tapers (because M2 would fall as money velocity picks up, stock prices falling can also exacerbate this as people are forced to invest in the real economy instead of the Wall Street economy) but the chances of it lasting more than a few years is slim to none.",Rafiki0069,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n24jla/inflation_nation/gwjj5ct/,0.035,0.9,0.064,0.6701

160,GDP," Fiscal deficits in times of economic peril, sure. However, how about a $1T deficit in 2018 after a giant corporate tax cut in the tenth year of a bull market? I'm guessing Keynes himself may have issued caution over that. 

Debt/GDP is currently what, like 1.5 or something? That's definitely sustainable...

The US only imports because slaves in other countries produce raw materials and consumer goods cheaper than the US. The US has been transitioning to an intellectual property exporter for a long time. The only reason we import anything is because the cost of production in the US is so high, and that would eat the margins of MNCs and cut into shareholder returns so we don't do it. We absolutely could produce everything we need with the resources we have here, perhaps with the exception of certain rare earth minerals and oil. Certainly textiles, food, building materials, metals, and things like that are all well within our borders. 

Lastly, it is certainly possible that the US dollar stops being the reserve currency. However, we have the Navy that essentially enables all global trade by securing ocean shipping lanes. A collapse of the US dollar without a replacement for the US military and the US consumer would be catastrophic for the entire world. At that point, it is almost a guarantee that China would be able to buy all assets from existing sovereigns because their people don't spend every last nickel that get their hands on yet.",Hacking_the_Gibson,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n24jla/inflation_nation/gwjh9zu/,0.066,0.828,0.106,0.8302

260,GME," As someone who works in Wall Street, I can tell you hedge funds are nowhere near the top dogs on the street. While most institutional investors are certainly paying attention to the price movements influenced by retail, none of the big players in PE or IB are terribly worried. I understand framing it as a play against hedge funds in particular but as an upfront to the whole of Wall Street is a tad far fetched.

As for pricing pressure on this stock in particular, to be fair, I am not well versed in this company but I think playing off momentum as you seem to be doing (focusing in on buy/sell ratio) is risky at this price point. If you got in early, congrats. I mean that genuinely, the market is rigged against small players and I am always happy when the little guy wins. But at a certain point, you have to learn to take profits and move on.

I'm a fan of the GME phenomenon but not at the expense of shutting down other members of this sub who have genuinely interesting plays in the market. Whether they win or they lose - there is always something to learn. But this hyper focus on GME is coming at the expense of opportunities for learning and investment for all other members.

Think plunging necklines, to draw the eye to the goods, on an up-cycled hand dyed dress or earrings the size of puppies to detract from fat pale bloated face. 

People are going to want to get ‚Äúout there‚Äù and wear beautiful bright colors and flashy pieces that are unique. Plus since they couldn‚Äôt travel they got all this cash saved up to spend on impressing people. So they will wear nice stuff and go on Holiday.

326,VG," > Elon Musk is sort of into space tourism as well, although I can't tell if they are officially selling tickets yet. Please feel free to put any updates in the comments.

Yes, Elon Musk / SpaceX is definitely into space tourism.  But SpaceX is in a totally different league than Virgin Galactic and Blue Origin.

VG and BO both offer **suborbital** joyrides--  Bring you to about 80-100km altitude and float down to experience a few minutes of zero-g.  VG and BO's rockets are not fast enough to reach orbit--  Just 1.0 km/s vs. 9.3 km/s for an orbital rocket like the SpaceX Falcon 9.

SpaceX offers **orbital** tourism in 2 different flavors:

1)  Launch you into low-earth orbit for 2-3 days in a Crew Dragon capsule.  This is the tourist ticket Shift4 Payments chairman Jared Isaacman bought, for himself and 3 other tourists.  Price undisclosed, but rumored to be about $220 million for the flight, and they will fly in September this year.  The space tourism company Space Adventures has also bought a Falcon 9 / Crew Dragon tourist flight like this one.

2) Launch on Falcon 9 / Crew Dragon to visit the ISS for a week.  This is what Axiom Space bought from SpaceX--  The Ax-1 mission is all set for next spring, with 1 professional astronaut and 3 millionaire tourists.  Tom Cruise also signed up for a later Axiom-brokered SpaceX Crew Dragon flight to the ISS.

The only competitor to SpaceX in the orbital tourism market right now is Roscosmos, with their Soyuz rocket/capsule.  They are also resuming selling Soyuz seats to tourists to visit the ISS for a week, about $40-some million per seat.",joepublicschmoe,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n2qauj/spce_still_has_legs_but_faces_challengers/gwl59ye/,0.0,0.927,0.073,0.9413

334,VG," I agree starship is more efficient and profitable and has more capabilities. 

But like I said, in your article the ""first #dearmoon customer is 2023, likely 2024 with delays""

The window is closing but both VG and BO expect to start next year. 

Another variable, when Starship is certified, will commercial human flight be its first and primary function and in what capacity? Same point of departure, point to point travel, ISS tourism, a week in orbit, or taking people to mars?
