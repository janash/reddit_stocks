77,AHT," I've been in AHT a month ago at 400 @ 2.50 expecting that to be the dip and then it dipped lower to 1.88 so I averaged down to 500 @ 2.37. Then it just starts rising late this week with pumpers coming out of nowhere on Stock Twits following along. No idea how high it'll get but expect it to do better in the Summer months and keep improving from there as COVID risk lowers and traveling returns more and more, especially business travel. I may just hold even if it hits $5 or $6 a share.
