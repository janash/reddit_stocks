Everyone knows the whole point of playing CTXR is to get a pop off of some kind of news. The assumption is that Mino-Lok is an amazing product that has no competition, and so good news surrounding it will let the stock run a little.

Nobody's buying them because of their financials, which seems to be what you're criticizing them about. Another point to that, you're criticizing a pharmaceutical company about their financials as if pharma companies are known for them.

CTXR is a blatant swing play on 2 things: Mino-Lok (for those who are long), but more importantly for Mino-Lok *news*, which I think is what you're skimming over here.

Quit being facetious.

Regardless, the direct comparison of two companies is basically irrelevant. It is not the correct way to value a company as there could be a multitude of reasons why either data point may be heavily biased. If you want to compare the company to the industry average, I'd listen to that argument.

I'm not mixing the currencies. I'm just taking them directly from the disclosures. If I was to convert them myself, that wouldn't accurately reflect their financial data per their disclosures.

The company also recently appointed directors with restructuring experience to the Board and its Strategic Planning Committee. News reports have indicated that GTT may consider bankruptcy restructuring following the close of its infrastructure asset sale later this year. All these point to a heightened risk of GTT pursuing a restructuring or a DDE in the near term.”,Nabistai,5,/r/pennystocks/comments/nepwog/gtt_potential_short_squeeze_and_the_greatest/gyhruc4/,0.065,0.913,0.022,-0.5994
83,IT," Done lots of research. I strongly believe this will be a $10-11 stock in the near future. The debt is likely to hire new employees and they're generating new revenue from those employees. With time that revenue will become more and more profitable. I see this as a huge plus that the company is expanding, more than doubling their employee count. That'll help them gain national dominance in the IT sector. The market sees this as negative because the stock was shorted in congruence to these events. I think this is a huge positive as it shows the company is making extreme efforts to grow as fast as possible, securing revenues and future profit.

Yet even if they did nothing; the evaluation for their current revenue, cash flow, equity, and employee count, is incredibly low, and theres huge upside even without the event of positive catalysts in the future.",Even-Independence-56,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/nepwog/gtt_potential_short_squeeze_and_the_greatest/gyhoqbc/,0.051,0.756,0.193,0.9689
