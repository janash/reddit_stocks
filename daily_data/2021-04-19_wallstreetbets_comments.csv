But in today's market and the unknown behind the scenes speculation related to GME, it's not the best for a WSB type play unless you're doing LEAPS and are fine with actually holding/weathering some storms for a bit.

It's a good stock for r/investing and building a position over time, but don't expect any major jumps on it. Yes, the stock is up nearly 200% over the past 8mo, but it's not been a steady climb by any means. 

Most of the gains came from the December Ordeleyo approval and the run-up to COVID Vaccine Release. Galidesivir was being pushed hard at the end of last year and the beginning of this year and there was a lot of hype, but they lost a good bit of steam when they announced galidesivir would no longer be studied to treat covid. 

Galidesivir and their Factor D-Inhibitor (BCX9930) have great future outlook potential though, but they need FDA approval still.

147,PLUS," Firstly. CEO himself as i stated confirmed in the last ConferenceCall they will bring 500MM PLUS revenue with Orladeyo. I added a link to it so that you can confirm it. That's the Most conservative scenario. Secondly as i stated aswell, the competition use NEEDLES, Orladeyo uses ORAL PILLS, which brings QUALITY of life for patients. As i also stated there have been multiple surveys asking the competition whether they would or not switch from their actual treatment to Oraldeyo.

Thirdly, I've never said Peramivir is worth ""Billions"" I said 500MM, as i stated it, that's basically what the development of it cost it brings annual revenue even if its small. This year its confirmed it will bring 7MM.

Galidesivir is an antiviral fully developed by the government NIAID. They do not reveal much info about the studies and they take a long time often. Thing is they FULLY fund the study, its basically a drug for free no expenses.

153,AEVA," So I work for McLane Foodservice here in Houston, Tx and we were suppose to pick up Jack in the Box this summer. Due to us closing a deal with Whataburger, those JIB plans have been scrapped temporarily. What we were planning to do was send a empty trailer from Houston to Dallas and have a full load of JIB shuttled back to be distributed around the Houston area. We have done this in the past with companies such as Arby's and Panda Express. Multiple trailers go up empty while swapping trailers and coming back with 40k lbs of food product to be delivered.

Ok, so now that I got that out of the way. McLane Foodservice is one of Berkishire Hathaways holdings. Been around since the year 1906, family owned until Sam Walton bought it and the old owner bought the Astros. (not important) Sam Walton eventually sold after Pepsi, AmeriServ, PFS, and Finally Berkshire. (might not be 100% accurate on timeline of ownership)

Recently, McLane invested in Orange EV yard trucks (bobtails that move trailers around the parking lot and docked into building doors to be loaded) at some of their locations. As of January/February I was having a discussion with our director of operations and he said that we would not be hiring any extra drivers when we take on JIB this summer and trailers would be shuttled using the driverless technology in these trucks by AEVA.

Now, it was cool to hear that but at the same time it was hard to believe that we would be incorporating a technology that hasn't even been figured out in mainstream automobiles to be 100% safe and we are expecting this company to have figured it out in Semi-Trucks. The technology would drive the truck from the Distribution Center in Dallas to the Distribution Center in Houston all the way to the entrance gate before a driver on location takes over.

Since we have scrapped the JIB plans for now, I don't know much more about what is happening with this technology but it all started from what is going on with our DC is Arizona. I was told they are or have been using this in Phoenix with this driverless technology. I think that once phones are mandatory, and everyone has starlink type internet connection as well as road ratings (driverless % ratings of auto-piolet disablement) with quick updates to construction through city contracts and policys, this will still not be 100%. People need to be connected to driverless automobiles and I think mandatory phones are a solution. Highway use may be a different story but like what just happened not to far from where I live in The Woodlands, Texas, that Tesla Car Crash is a concern because the technology didn't respond.

Public (Stock) Companies we also use daily are Trimble, VMWare, Zebra, Volvo Trucks, Freightliner trucks. We service Yum Foods (Taco Bell, KFC, Pizza Hut), Chilies, Applebee's, IHOP, Whataburger, Buffalo Wild Wings, Chick Fil-A, Golden Coral, and others. Our grocery division has contracts with Walgreens as well. We are nation wide and that's what landed us the distribution contract with Whataburger.

Our Delivery Drivers make 65-100k+ a year and we are always hiring. 4 day work weeks but you can work more if you want more $. If you or anyone you know that has a CDL, is mentally tough, and has a good attitude but kinda edgy, please make them aware as job openings are ramping up and we want to help employ people that want to work at McLane.

185,CRWD," This seems like it will work. For one to choose this strategy, they really must understand themselves. It is going to be incredibly difficult to not panic when down 80%. Or even lesser amounts of 20-50%. 

I‚Äôm curious how it would do between successive large downturns in the market. Strategies really pick up steam when they are able to quickly build a lead in the beginning. For longer term returns, even after larger drawdowns, the lead in annualized return is maintained. But if you got caught in a couple of bear markets within a two year time period, how are you going to do? My guess is you still come out ahead. Again though, it may take an incredible amount of mental fortitude to not abandon this strategy.

One question:
Do you have a particular reason for picking rebalancing bands of 1.8x and 2.2x, or just because they feel like a good balance?

187,IMO," Fellow factor enthusiast here.

Multifactor funds are pretty trash. Head over to portfolio visualizer and use the factor regression tool if you don't believe me - the only real factor loading you're getting is to Œ≤, but you're paying 10x the fees you should be paying for Œ≤. Also, remember that the value companies you own in excess of market cap weights [are already leveraged!](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=112553) I would also be *very* careful with MOM + leverage for obvious reasons. It's a trade where people can head for the exits very quickly.

IMO, the best factors you want to leverage are low beta and quality, but especially low beta. A leveraged, defensively tilted portfolio is basically the secret sauce of the likes of Buffet for stocks and Gross for bonds. (see [this](https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Research/Alternative-Thinking/Superstar-Investors) and [this](https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Research/Journal-Article/Buffetts-Alpha))  Value and momentum are where you want to be if you can handle a 3% tracking error and a bit of a bumpy ride on an unlevered portfolio IMO.",throwaway474673637,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mtmfkk/drydrink_portfolio_guide_to_leveraged_smartbeta/gv1g0zw/,0.083,0.779,0.138,0.829

If don't have 100k for PM in a non tax-advantaged account, it isn't work doing box spreads or still worth doing on XSP with a smaller account for example?

189,IBKR," I am also using leverage. However I'm using about 1.05-1.10 leverage. Going 2.00 seems insane and ultra risky even with a diversified portfolio. I'd probably go up to 1.2-1.4 leverage if the market suddenly drops, but you never know when that will happen.

Just wondering what is your contingency or plans if say the market drops 20-30%? Are you sure your portfolio can withstand such a drop? That might be enough to wipe you out if you're going on 2x leverage. Remember that it's called ""margin call"" but IBKR (I use them as well) isn't your friend and they don't ***HAVE*** to give you that call.

If you don't have PM, selling boxes of any kind, or any index, is useless because your MM goes up by as much as the box is valued.

203,IMO," That kind of Sharpe and vol might have been achieved by Risk Parity in the past, given the amazing bond bull market and exceptional commodities returns. Nowadays, commodities are financialized and display hefty contango, which is why they've shown abysmal returns for decades now. And bond rates are not assured to drop like they did for the past 40 years, so clearly you shouldn't use the last 40 years of bond return. Whenever I calculate the efficient frontier using commodity risk premiums that are half of the historical norms, and bond risk premiums **adjusted for rate changes** since the 80s, I generally get a Sharpe under 0.5, and portfolios mostly made up of stocks. So I do find commodities and bonds are in the efficient frontier (though the Risk Parity portfolio definitely is NOT), their weights are typically inconsequential. When I factor in tax costs, they're just not worth it IMO.

204,FSD," 1. They accelerate faster, which can mean safer switching of lanes, getting on to highways or being able to avoid things easier.
2. The battery pack makes for a very strong platform, means it is less likely a collision results in the interior of the car collapsing (i.e. less chance of another vehicle to essentially enter your passenger space)
3. No motor up front, means the whole front is a giant crumple zone, which means a lot less crushing of legs or other parts in an accident, as well as more space to absorb the force of impact (i.e. less forces transferred to passengers).
4. Batteries may be less likely to catch on fire then gas tanks in accidents (even if putting out battery fires may be especially challenging)
5. Lower center of gravity, means high speed maneuvers are less likely to result in loss of control or flipping over. Also means, even if someone hits you, you are less likely to spin out or lose control and can instead bring your vehicle safely to a stop.
6. Systems like Autopilot, for all their flaws, might result in more consistent and predictable driving which should be safer overall. Tesla's systems seem to encourage more use of these things as compared to other manufacturers systems, which is overall a good thing (I think).

So what are the downsides... well some idiots think that allowing the car to drive itself is a good idea and naturally the car comes upon circumstances where the system is not capable of handling properly and people die as a result. So basically, don't leave the driver seat if using autopilot or FSD and do pay attention. Really not that hard and is on you the driver.

I swear it read 1 accident per 375,000 miles VS 1 per 475,000 for other cars. The article says 1 per 3.7 million miles.

At the very end:

Last month, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the automobile safety agency in the United States, said it was looking into a ""violent crash that occurred on March 11 in Detroit involving a Tesla and a tractor-trailer.""

The agency has in recent years formed Special Crash Investigation teams to look into Tesla crashes related to the vehicle's Autopilot system.

Tesla reports one accident for every 3.7 million miles driven while Autopilot is engaged. Over the past two years, the number of miles driven per accident, with the Autopilot on, has increased 18%. In comparison, the NHTSA reports one accident for about 475,000 miles driven for all U.S. vehicles.

Tesla cars are getting in more accidents compared to all vehicles. If they are safer in general that should be happening...

Would be interesting to compare them to other high performance sedans? Possible the ""theme"" of the car is a reason its higher than the average?

On the other hand, they might slow down and allow them to cross. However, What If the pedestrian began crossing the road without realizing that you are driving towards them? AI is not human, and it is difficult to make choices like this. You're pretty much relying on a robot to determine whether it should speed up or slow down to keep the pedestrian safe. These sort of situations are called ""tricky situations,"" where the driving solution may be too ambiguous for AI. Most of the time, it will make the right choice, but sometimes it will not.

MIT actually conducted a study where they had autonomous vehicles travel 300,000 miles. During this study, they determined that autopilot encountered a ""tricky situation"" every 9.2 miles.

265,ES," The ETFs do not track the VIX and do not claim to. Its physically impossible to replicate the spot VIX using derivatives. The ETFs track a VIX futures index with a specified average time to maturity.

VXX tracks a VIX futures index with a weighted average of 1 month to maturity. If the near-month VIX future expires 10 days from now and the far-month VIX future expires 40 days from now, the ETF would hold 33.3% near-month VIX futures and 66.7% far-month VIX futures to achieve the weighted average TTM. At the end of the day, there would be 9 days left on the near-month and 39 days left on the far-month. The ETF would then do its daily rebalance by rolling 3.3% of the near-month VIX futures to the far-month VIX futures (and end up with 30% near-month, 70% far-month) to maintain the correct weighted average TTM.

Spot VIX is a derived index that comes from taking the prices of a shitload of options. The VIX future is a contract that expires on the print of spot VIX on the expiry date of the future. That's why spot VIX can fly up but the VIX future may barely move if market participants don't expect VIX to stay this high by the future expiry.

This is of course nothing like the SPY basket vs. the ES future where it's arbitragable. There is no arbitrage between spot VIX and VIX futures, they are 2 very different things.

299,UPS," As a Class A CDL holder I'll pipe up here.

It is NOT a lack of drivers, it is a lack of wages.  The big companies, Swift etc want hordes of low wage slaves working for 25-30 cents per mile.  The government is no longer enforcing the requirement that a CDL holder be able to read, write and speak English.  An over the road driver can drive 11 hours a day, and work a total of 14.  Some of these restrictions were waived due covid.  Even the better companies where jobs are readily available pay around 50-60 cents a mile.  With enough work that is around $75k/year.  Not much considering that you are away from home almost the entire year.  Wages have been held down by flooding the market with cheap labor, just not cheap enough for the big firms.  Add in about $5k for training, (or 2 years indentured servitude to an outfit like Swift).

Owner/operator is a whole different game, with shipping brokers siphoning off most of the money to be made, leaving crumbs for the operators.

I just shuttle trailers on weekends for some extra cash to pay for kids private school.  No way would I take an over the road job without wages increasing 200-300%.

Bottom line the big firms have enough drivers.  Most of the others can't compete because they don't have a supply of drivers that will work for slave wages.  If they pay fair wages their shipping rates are too high (this applies to companies bidding on the open market).  However, try and find a job trucking for Walmart (directly, not a sub contractor), Fed Ex, UPS etc.  You practically have to know someone, as they have their own fleets to avoid disruptions, and pay well ($35/hour in the midwest)",teachthisdognewtrick,32,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mu0hvd/supply_chain_disruptions_and_you_a_discussion/gv33bum/,0.056,0.888,0.056,0.2787
300,TV," No.

Blame the safety rules imposed a few years back, on funds to states that didn't impose extreme health restrictions on CDL applicants. The ""logic "" was sound,  but not realistic. 

Diabetics cannot obtain a CDL now. People with heart conditions. People with q health issue that may or may not arise were blocked. I owned 6 trucks and drove 1 myself because I'm cheap. Most would say because they aren't lazy, but thats BS. Pocketing .32 a mile myself, instead of paying it out, as well as taking car of the vehicle like it should be....because I paid for it, saved me 89k and up a year. 

When the changes went in to effect and diabetic was tacked on to my physical, I was unable to renew my CDL. 2 years later 3 more guys. Finding people who were not fucking yahoos out of driving school became impossible and I could nolonger remain solvent as things were progressing with insurance and binding rates doubling every 6 months

Meanwhile the 50 companies who will take a 21yr old who thinks big trucks are tanks,are gobbling up and burning through these idiots, fucking the entire insurance side of trucking. They created a way to burn out small trucking companies which was compounded by we who drove for 20+ years, making deadlines at the cost of our health, so mamma and the kids had everything .

Now those guys, the ones who bust ass to get it done, ending up with heart conditions, cholesterol issues, diabetes (2 gallons of mnt dew and 8 packs of smokes gets your TVs delivered from California to New York in 2 days) and a plethora of health related issues that MAY CAUSE a scenario where you just DIE while driving, and wreck into 10 other cars, killing 8 people, is why those restrictions were put in to place.

But it's that dirty secret that exists in all industries. Someone is dying or going to die to ensure consumerism is met with products. Big truck fatalities were no higher, based on vehicles on the road, from 2001 to 2016, they were lower due to vehicle safety changes.....but some plant eating twat had to champion a no issue.....and thats why you have delivery problems.

The guys who will do the job are no longer legally able to. The guys hired to do the job miss home,pushy, and sponge Bob, so they take twice as long to deliver the same product,  and that is the bulk of your Swift,JB hunt, Covenant, US express....etc...etc drivers.  Kids who happy dragging feet and making 500.00 a week...

So you have companies calling every logistics outfit, hammering out contracts with penalties for slow/late delivery. It means the 3500.00 cost to ship 250,000.00 in TVs gets reduced to 1200 when its late. You will still buy the TV, they save.money, the companies keep hiring .17 a mile kids, and your specialized bullshit coffee hits shipped out when it gets shipped, not when you want it.



BUT....care to know what gets shipped on TIME at about 90% delivery time met? Fucking cigarettes. There are many kids who DO take to driving like a duck to water and they end up on those runs.

Know whose fright is the slowest? Uncle Sams. I delivered 40k lb of paper....to Alameda that was 7 months late, had been sitting in a container waiting to be picked up for half a year. Because Uncle Sam is another padding customer.

Why are you building factories off-grid? and just an FYI, this is a thing, except instead of nuclear, we use LPG/NG or Diesel. Generac can get you all the power you need in a few days without any permits.

There was a lot of bugs so they made money back but no body know about this: money back was only for buyers who bought game before 14.12.2020 and there was only period time to get this money back 14.12 - 21.12.2020 if some1 bought it after doesnt count, if some1 came for money back after 21.12 - doesnt count.

Full year report will be on 22.04.2021.
Why it is so important? Cuz they made so much money but I think it was only on the game, you should know that they have also fun shop.
If you want buy all item just once It's: $2.9k!!!(80items, shirts, jackets, statues, backpacks etc.)
