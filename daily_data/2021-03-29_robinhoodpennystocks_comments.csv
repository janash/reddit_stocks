I didn't start ambitiously investing on my own save for the Roth I started in October until early January which was just before the mega bull run ended. I was just getting into pennies in particular late January before the corrections began and it's been tough going. That said I also have to realize this is needed because too many tickers were getting gassed up to crazy levels. I initially bought ZOM at around 1.57 and was shocked to hear months later it used to be like 40 cents or something.

I fully agree that right now might be a good time ot largely take a break from most penny tickers cause the market is just a bit too all over the place. Once I am done with GNUS this week I'll probably keep a greater chunk of my speculating account in cash while maybe trying to fool with crypto a bit or park some money in an ETF to slowly build a little capital while I wait for good penny opportunities to show themselves again.
