5,GNUS," Honestly trading for basically from April last year up to early February was easy mode. Really am envious of my brother who had enough free time due to being out of college to start fiddling with trading last year cause there was so many opportunities to make trades overall. 

I didn't start ambitiously investing on my own save for the Roth I started in October until early January which was just before the mega bull run ended. I was just getting into pennies in particular late January before the corrections began and it's been tough going. That said I also have to realize this is needed because too many tickers were getting gassed up to crazy levels. I initially bought ZOM at around 1.57 and was shocked to hear months later it used to be like 40 cents or something.

I fully agree that right now might be a good time ot largely take a break from most penny tickers cause the market is just a bit too all over the place. Once I am done with GNUS this week I'll probably keep a greater chunk of my speculating account in cash while maybe trying to fool with crypto a bit or park some money in an ETF to slowly build a little capital while I wait for good penny opportunities to show themselves again. I have way more money in longer term accounts and a market like this makes me grateful for that since most of the stuff in those accounts will more reliably bounce back.",OKJMaster44,3,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/mfg3kz/the_good_old_days/gso6na7/,0.042,0.821,0.137,0.9771
