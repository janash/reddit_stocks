1,ATOS," This week has seen:

- **Wednesday**: 9,998 naked 0.5c sold to open in the space of 15 minutes, at an estimated margin req. of over $10mil, spaced out perfectly to dump the price by 10% but not to allow a circuit breaker. 
- **Thursday**: thousands of ATM calls sold to fight against an influx of retail call buying (prompted by a separate subreddit leader) which broke through repeated half million share sell walls. 
- **Friday**: thousands and thousands firesold blocks of ITM 2.5c, 3c, 3.5c, OTM 12c, 16c, and ATM October and Jan ‘23 calls sold to crash the price by 15% 

Needless to say, whoever bought ATOS last week really pissed off some short hedge fund.

14,CTXR," I clarified my comment. I was thinking of people buying CTXR and expecting it to hit $8 within a month, which is a very large ROI for a small cap in such a short time.

For EEENF or pennies, the crazy price targets are an order of magnitude crazier. Heck, I made 400% on RGBP in April, but someone told me he thinks it will be $0.24 by the end of the month. I'd love that, but I don't think 2000% is realistic.",PsycheRevived,7,/r/pennystocks/comments/ocpizg/eeenf_sub_has_turned_into_a_circle_jerk_fan_club/h3w3lv9/,0.034,0.894,0.072,0.7227
15,CTXR," Sorry if I wasn't clear. I took the comment above mine to be referring to stock specific forums, where insane price targets get thrown around like crazy. It wasn't specific to EEENF.


Specifically, I had just read price targets for CTXR where they wouldn't sell for less than $8 after test results or less than $15 after FDA approval. That's what made me think 200%.

EEENF is even crazier, as it has room to fly. I fully expect EEENF to go up 200% between now and spring. In the EEENF forum, crazy price targets are ""dollars"" or even $0.50.

16,CTXR," Won’t lie, I probably would have sold CTXR at $4 if TRCH didn’t go utterly nuclear. TRCH not only matched up with my exit strategy but the actual heights blew my imagination (6x at one point for me) which made me overestimate CTXR’s short term potential. If TRCH had peaked at $6 on Monday before deadline I probably woulda taken my CTXR profits to be safe.
