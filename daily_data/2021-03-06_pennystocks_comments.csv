Pivot to COVID-19; has three unique COVID-19 tests close to receiving FDA EUA approval – and two of the tests are post- COVID-19 tests, that will be used forever.
Also is launching ecommerce direct-to-consumer business with HOME test kits for the masses; currently COVID and autoimmune disease; intends to be a leader in the new industry of home healthcare testing –   massive market, small % leads to big revenue numbers.
It’s undiscovered… for the moment, and the investor base is almost all Canadian. U.S. investors don’t know about it but are starting to and will in a big way. It started out 15 years ago in clinical research and never found its footing but now a new U.S. CEO has set a completely new strategy, that has multiple potential revenue streams.
It currently trades on the OTC/Toronto market but is moving to the NASDAQ or NYSE. This will open it up to a huge new institutional investor base.
The shares are tightly held by 3 insiders who own 76%. Demand will outstrip supply.

54,RH, I get your point on the crypto however if someone’s thinks crypto has already had its big run up and will only grow at a normal level going forward. You look at options that haven’t seen the same crazy rise but could still capitalize on the increased price of crypto. Such as miners or makers of the miners as even if crypto stays the same price these companies can now make way more then they were and if crypto rises well that’s great news for these plays as well. Also for me I don’t use RH to trade so buying crypto invokes the pia of setting up a wallet or signing up somewhere (I did eventually set one up) but at least the one I use doesn’t allow like limit buys and sells and racks on a fee every transaction and I don’t have all day to stare and wait for it to hit the price I want. where I can trade all day the stocks on Schwab for nothing with limits. Maybe other people have better reasons just my own rambling thoughts. Out of crypto plays I have about 90% into crypto stocks and 10% in the coin itself,Holdihold,8,/r/pennystocks/comments/lynxfs/controversial_opinions_march_05_2021/gpub321/,0.008,0.852,0.14,0.9794
55,DD," Just so you know lots of people rotate in and out of a chunk of stocks they research and decide which have the largest short/medium gains while putting those gains back into the previous. Not everyone's strategy is *press buy and close app* that's based on how much time you spend. 

I'd argue that most emotional issues with investing either go back to bad/lack of DD or gambling addiction doing things you couldn't afford to. *Red days are easier the more info you have to lean on.*

And there's a couple crypto conversations I haven't really bought the mining facilities but i see the value.  It's basically 2Xing crypto. Booms and long term they gain as they are gathering more over time by mining it so it's bigger than holding it alone. (If you haven't gone down that rabbit hole, mining = using physical hardware to exchange the currency's trade data and in return you have small % chances to get some of that currency as a return)

Couple that with the possibility of legalization in the US could have the stock much higher.  I predict $0.80 to $1.10 (US dollars) by Sept.  With legalization in the US, it could go much higher.

124,CEO," Jesus is Victory Square paying you? You sound like a massive promoter. Also for the love of god use paragraphs you sound like a child that needs to take a breath while speaking. I also never said it’s somehow “safe” you jumped the gun and began putting words into my mouth like, again, a excited child.

Back to the point. ABQQ revenue was actually growing before the pandemic hit, their share price was around $10-$11 due to them being a entertainment company that sponsored/hosted concerts. 

Their CEO actually bought shares to avoid further dilution, the company is actively investing into movies, online streaming services, and has enough capital to last for approximately a year with manageable debt. 

Simply because it’s a Chinese business doesn’t make it a immediate scam like your implication, you who seem to use simple buzz words or repeats what everyone else says about said company to sound smart.

Simple fact is that all stocks are a gamble, ABQQ is a gamble that can back fire, but it’s a gamble that has made me money and can possibly jump back to their pre pandemic share price which would be like winning the lottery.

Recently the company hired a experienced investment adviser and will be releasing their other movie is April, and considering the other movie they released actually did good at the box office there is high expectations.

In conclusion, ABQQ is a gamble that I think is worth investing into.",FallenZulu,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/lyscfw/penny_stock_suggestions/gpzd0lc/,0.036,0.812,0.153,0.974

185,NOK," NOK is a long term play and should be thought of as such for those investing in it. And no it’s not that I’m smart, it’s probably more so I’m old and would think that people should research and teach themselves about what they are doing versus just jumping into something without a thought of their own.",Leomaximusdaspartan,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/lyr00l/why_does_this_happen/gpufhi4/,0.076,0.883,0.041,-0.2635

192,CEO, People on here think they are a “genius” after doing a small search on an OTC. So much of the info out there is VERY outdated and has nothing to do with today’s market. If u take the time to dig u can find what you are looking for. BBRW from my experience is a lot of “fluff” from the CEO. Last year around this time it ran from 2 cent to 9 cents in a day. After that it fell to 4 cent then slowly fell and fell and fell and fell and fell all the way back to .003 I think was around the lowest point. BBRW is going to start diluting shares soon as well and they will dilute on the way UP. Just like 3 weeks ago i sold for almost .02 and it was back down well under a penny. The whole thing is a mess.,Forward-Tip-2174,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/lyxk3x/why_do_i_see_different_financials_for_different/gpwhtoa/,0.035,0.903,0.061,0.4215
