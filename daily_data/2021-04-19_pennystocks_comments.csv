Its now owned by an active CEO named Rob Van Dam. (RVD) is a well known WWE wrestler lol. He even tweeted a hint about things to come. Paperwork was already filed in Nevada. Could be something big big. 

Celebrity endorsement, plus a legit website and products that seem to be well recieved.

CEO and CFO have recently negotiated new pay deals which see a reduction in cash payment but larger portion of shares. This would see them benefit handsomely from a share price recovery. They must firmly believe they can turn this around to accept a deal like this.

In recent years RR has been plagued by premature wear on its Trent 1000 engines fan blades. This has seen fleets grounded while fixes have been developed and there's been multiple fixes attempted. It's been a real drain on the company's finances. However, they seem to now be confident that this is going to be a thing of the past. Take this with a grain of salt, with such severely reduced flying hours it's hard to see how there's enough data to make this call

Against: 

Throughout 2020 and into 2021, RR has undertaken a sizeable redundancy program:

https://uk-finance-yahoo-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/uk.finance.yahoo.com/amphtml/news/rolls-royce-h2-redundancies-job-cuts-results-074709420.html?amp_js_v=a6&amp_gsa=1&usqp=mq331AQHKAFQArABIA%3D%3D#aoh=16188355124528&amp_ct=1618835535763&referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&amp_tf=From%20%251%24s&ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fuk.finance.yahoo.com%2Fnews%2Frolls-royce-h2-redundancies-job-cuts-results-074709420.html

As I'm sure you're all aware, redundancy programs tend to target the older employees who may be on a higher salary but with that comes experience. RR has gotten rid of a lot and while this looks good from a numbers point of view, there is now a risk that the loss of experience will start to show in the coming years. Hiring experienced people costs more than nurturing existing employees but you need the experience in house to learn from. 

RR are proposing a 10 (5 for some functions) day unpaid leave later this year. This is to be voted on by union members and given the poor reason as to why furlough (UK government's job retention scheme for organisations who have seen a loss in earnings due to covid) cannot be used to provide the UK workforce (highest concentration of RR's workforce) with at least some pay, I don't see the vote being concerned a certainty

My opinion:

I think there will be a recovery of sorts, the market seems to react to positive news about travel, the whole aviation and travel industries tend to spike on news. RR is not that closely linked though, Their products stay in service for decades so a restart in air travel is not the full picture. Short term gains might fade.

I think RR will want to make some changes to it's business model. Currently, it sells its engines at a loss and makes up that loss and makes profit on service plans and commission on flying hours. I think they'll look to get rid of the loss on sales, however their customers have also been heavily hit by the pandemic are they going to willingly accept?

Its the best penny stock company Ive ever seen, yet the stock has been hit by the recent OTC sell offs... The company (CBDD, Rockflowr) is profitable and expanding exponentially. They've already done 50% of 2020s revenue in the first Q of 2021 (8Million). 

They are based in Switzerland, operate in Europe and the US and sell CBD products in bulk, as well as in a retail Store that they own, and in 500+ Stores (kiosk and Spar stores). 

Even with all of their success right now they are only trading at 2x projected revenue multiple which is a joke if you do good DD. 

Thankfully, they are UPLISTING by end of May to OTCQB, which should give them some much needed exposure!

Tollovid - FDA approved for free sale and available for purchase now is a dietary supplement which inhibits 3cl protease from replicating. 

“One really promising product available to consumers today is Todos Medical’s antiviral supplement, Tollovid, which is available for purchase online through a top CBD store, The Alchemist’s Kitchen. Todos has done in-vitro studies on Tollovid, a proprietary herb blend with 3CL protease inhibitors (viral replication inhibitors), and it has shown that the blend does indeed inhibit this key protease, which is critical for intracellular viral replication of coronaviruses.”

Tollovir - Getting ready for phase 2 trial. Biological target 3cl protease, this is also the target of Pfizer’s antiviral, but todos is currently ahead of Pfizer in dev

“What is most interesting about this product is its biological target, the 3CL protease. This is a validated target as a coronavirus antiviral and it is a key target for drug development at big pharma, Pfizer (PFE). The reality of the situation, however, is that Todos is ahead of Pfizer in this regard, with clinical trials underway and a product that is already on the market “

Todos currently undervalued when compared to recent acquisitions

“Since Todos Medical is approximately at the same point in the phase of development as these other therapeutics, the only variable the investors have to consider is the discount to the comparable valuation. For example, if an investor believes the Todos Medical technology is only half (50%) as good as AVIR, then the current market valuation of TOMDF would be $175 million, which translates into a fair value of $.32 per share. In this example, the investor would compare the current price of $.05 to $.32 and realize the stock is grossly undervalued. If the investor believes that the TOMDF technology is only worth 10% of AVIR, then the discounted value of the stock would be $.063 versus the current price of $.05 and conclude the stock is mildly undervalued. Big pharma like Pfizer is pursuing the same 3CL target, which means Todos Medical should be worth considerably more than $350 million.”",ConsciousSquirrel0,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/mtylxr/great_dd_article_on_tomdf_oral_covid_therapeutic/gv2odxo/,0.023,0.871,0.106,0.9832

Tollovid - FDA approved for free sale and available for purchase now is a dietary supplement which inhibits 3cl protease from replicating. 

“One really promising product available to consumers today is Todos Medical’s antiviral supplement, Tollovid, which is available for purchase online through a top CBD store, The Alchemist’s Kitchen. Todos has done in-vitro studies on Tollovid, a proprietary herb blend with 3CL protease inhibitors (viral replication inhibitors), and it has shown that the blend does indeed inhibit this key protease, which is critical for intracellular viral replication of coronaviruses.”

Tollovir - Getting ready for phase 2 trial. Biological target 3cl protease, this is also the target of Pfizer’s antiviral, but todos is currently ahead of Pfizer in dev

“What is most interesting about this product is its biological target, the 3CL protease. This is a validated target as a coronavirus antiviral and it is a key target for drug development at big pharma, Pfizer (PFE). The reality of the situation, however, is that Todos is ahead of Pfizer in this regard, with clinical trials underway and a product that is already on the market “

Todos currently undervalued when compared to recent acquisitions

“Since Todos Medical is approximately at the same point in the phase of development as these other therapeutics, the only variable the investors have to consider is the discount to the comparable valuation. For example, if an investor believes the Todos Medical technology is only half (50%) as good as AVIR, then the current market valuation of TOMDF would be $175 million, which translates into a fair value of $.32 per share. In this example, the investor would compare the current price of $.05 to $.32 and realize the stock is grossly undervalued. If the investor believes that the TOMDF technology is only worth 10% of AVIR, then the discounted value of the stock would be $.063 versus the current price of $.05 and conclude the stock is mildly undervalued. Big pharma like Pfizer is pursuing the same 3CL target, which means Todos Medical should be worth considerably more than $350 million.”",ConsciousSquirrel0,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/mtylxr/great_dd_article_on_tomdf_oral_covid_therapeutic/gv2odxo/,0.023,0.871,0.106,0.9832
