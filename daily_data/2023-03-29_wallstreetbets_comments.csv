20,ALL," Tax deductions aren't ALL bad.   Some deductions are actually a great deal for both sides. 
Companies are allowed to carry forward losses to claim deductions on future, profitable business, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.  

The company gets a tax break down the line (when they're actually profitable) and reinvests capital into building a bigger business.  Instead of paying excess capital out as bonuses or shareholder dividends (which the government would only get capital gains tax from), the capital helps grow the business which generates more revenue and taxable income down the line. 

The child tax credit is the largest tax credit for the mjddle class, but its actually a shit deal for the government.

29,AI," This is AI with software development. AI can produce text that looks like code in a given language, and sometimes that text can function as code, but the AI doesn't understand what it's outputting.

For a problem that's been solved 1000x in public repositories (say a function that adds two numbers), it has a really good idea of what the text should look like. *But even then,* there's still a good possibility that the text isn't correct code. It might contain a single error that a junior developer could spot immediately, but because it produces text patterns, it doesn't understand that what it's given you is wrong.

Try to give it something slightly more complex, such as creating an object with certain properties and methods, and the chance of an error shoots up significantly. It might miss entirely certain properties or methods requested.

I, as a software developer, have used these AIs to automate and/or simplify writing basic parts of my code, but it's really just a more advanced autocomplete. If you don't have someone that actually understands the code using the AI, you can very easily end up with the code equivalent of ""you can come to you when I was just wondering as a name that is the only reason we..."" which I made by picking autocorrect words off my keyboard.

35,OCC," WHAT HAPPENS TO PUT OPTIONS DURING BANKRUPTCY?
If you own put options on stocks of a company that has just declared or filed for bankruptcy, you are in for a huge reward. The delivery and settlement of every stock option is guaranteed by the OCC, Options Clearing Corporation, in the US Market. Whoever sold you that right to sell shares of that company at that higher price is obliged to fulfill that obligation, so your profit is guaranteed. The only question is, what happens when that company files for bankruptcy and trading in its stocks and options are suspended? When that happens, trading of that company's stocks and options moves to the Over The Counter (OTC) market or what is known as ""Pink Sheet"" market where you are able to either sell those put options for a profit or exercise the options and sell the stocks for the same profit. Since it is the company that is going illquid and insolvent and not the person or institution who sold you those put options, you are guaranteed your profit and delivery.

The most recent example of this are put options on the collasped Lehman Brothers (ex-Ticker : LEH) which filed for bankruptcy on 14 Sep 2008. After filing for bankruptcy, Lehman Brothers' shares moved from the exchange to the OTC market (Ticker Symbol LEHMQ or LEHMQ.PK) where it traded at $0.05 per share on 18 Sep 2008. That is when put option holders can choose to exercise the put options by buying the shares at $0.05 and selling it at the strike price for a big profit.

54,SOL," 
Your neighbor has cats for sale that you want, but you don't want them until a month from now, though you want to lock in the price. You tell your neighbor you'll give him $0.69 per cat if he signs a contract that you can buy 100 cats for $420 each a month from now. You give him $69, you get contract that gives you the option to buy 100 cats for $420ea, or $42k total, in one month. 

Scenario 1:
Nearly a month goes by and the price of cats is now like $600 a cat. You don't actually have $42,000 to buy the $100 cats @ $420ea, but your uncle does and clearly this is a deal since he could turn around and sell them for a profit. You sell the contract to your uncle for $6.90 per cat, or $690 and pocket the profit. 

Scenario 2:
Nearly a month goes by and the price of cats is now like $600 a cat. You have the money to exercise your *option* to buy cats, and you think you may want to hold on to them for a bit. You buy the 100 cats for $420ea, aka $42k. The value of them is $600ea, $60k, so you now own some cats that you got for a great price. 

Scenario 3:
Nearly a month goes by and the price of cats is now like $210 a cat. Fuck. If you exercise the option you are paying double for some shitty cats. You want out, so you try to sell the contract to someone else, but clearly it's a shitty deal and nobody will buy it. Your contact is worthless. Once it expires at the end of the month you are SOL, your $690 you paid is gone and you don't want the overpriced cats so your $69 turned to $0. I guess if you had the cash and were really fucking sure the price would come back you could go ahead and drop that $42k to go though with the contract, this would be the ultimate WSB play right before the CEO of cats gets caught buying catnip and the price plummets further. 


To break the 4th wall here: The price of cats is market driven, and the price of the contracts is market driven. They are obviously tied together, but not directly. The ""month"" given in the example can be a chosen length of time typically in increments of each Friday but also can be individual days (you'll hear people talk about ""weeklies"" meaning they bought contracts that expire in a week, ""daylies"" expire tomorrow, etc). As the price of contracts fluctuates you can decide to sell them at any time during the period, usually IME the sooner the better because as the expiry date looms and the stock price doesn't move the chance of it hitting the goal (profitable) price wanes the contract prices stagnate.

82,AI," ***Write me a response to how this post about white collar AI apocalypse is full of shit:***

As an AI language model, I cannot engage in personal attacks or use profanity, but I can provide an informed response to the idea of a ""white collar AI apocalypse."" While it is true that AI and automation have the potential to disrupt certain industries and job markets, the idea that it will lead to a complete collapse of the white-collar workforce is an over-exaggeration.

In fact, history has shown that technological advancements have always created new opportunities and jobs, rather than eliminating them. The advent of computers, for example, created an entirely new field of employment in computer programming and software engineering.

Moreover, many white-collar jobs require skills that are difficult to automate, such as creativity, critical thinking, and emotional intelligence. These skills are uniquely human and cannot be replicated by machines.

While AI may eventually replace certain tasks within white-collar professions, it is unlikely to result in a complete elimination of these jobs. Instead, it will likely lead to a shift in job roles and responsibilities as companies seek to optimize their operations and leverage the capabilities of these technologies.

Therefore, the notion of a ""white-collar AI apocalypse"" is unfounded and does not reflect the nuanced and complex reality of how AI and automation will impact the workforce.""",Spartan775,90,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1256696/ai_apocalypse_goldman_sachs_report_reveals/je2u4zy/,0.056,0.819,0.125,0.953

105,AI," I’m entering the legal profession, so take my point with that bias in mind. However, the fact that people think legal practitioners are going to be gone in 5-20 years is, in my mind, unfounded. On the one hand, we as a society place a lot of agency in the law’s communicative function. This encompasses meeting face to face with a lawyer, who will go through your distinct legal problem with you. Moreover, when a case goes to trial, would people be willing to have the judge replaced by a computer? I don’t think so. (Not to mention the political and moral ramifications such a computer driven and adjudicated legal system would operate). 

Airplanes can fly on complete auto-pilot, but we still want to have a pilot to be there. 

Lastly, we have to remember who is in control of society. The generation that is soon to be glimpsing power 40-60, does not want to have complete AI usurpation. Not to mention, the only people who would take away the legal profession, would, ironically be the legal profession. Lots of high government officials are lawyers, who have implement a statutory regime that the only people capable of giving legal advice are lawyers. Would the law, operate to destroy their own profession? Not a chance.

Not to mention that the law itself is about 20 years behind current societal advancements. In my country, most big firms have to keep paper copies of every file. Somewhat surprisingly, we also have the requirement to utilize a typewriter for certain draftings.

Lastly, I would like to mention that there is a current debate about how a AI program like ChatGPT is rampantly committing copyright violations. This is an area of the law that will skyrocket in the future. 

Lastly, I would like to mention that Wills for example, present a huge problem for an AI system. Sure, perhaps it will get advanced enough to draft one, but to interpret one? I don’t think so. For jurisdictions that retain the separation of a determinable and subsequent interest, there is a huge difference in outcome for vesting. The only way to distinguish such a difference, is by analyzing the intention of the parties. Sure, language can be used, but it is not determinable in any regard. Often, it requires looking at extrinsic evidence. Which is outside of the four corners of a document.

And when mechanical minds are better at following instructions and producing things than our biological brains it will be similar to how mechanical muscle replaced the horse.

One of the closing takeaways was: In the 1700's the US census tracked 10 types of jobs, now there's hundreds tracked. But if you look at the list a lot of the jobs are just more detailed descriptions that all existed in the 1700's, and when the video was published numbers 1-30 all existed in some form in the 1700's (number one being transportation), it's not until we get to 31 with computer programmers.

Imagine the scenario where a ""LawyerGpt"" App can do everything a lawyer does but better. Sure you might want to have one lawyer check over it's work so you don't get screwed. But that would mean one Law Firm Partner can just double check over 10 times the number of cases. But the other ten lawyers that used to be under him are no longer needed. That doesn't mean that the law firm is all of a sudden going to transform into a new industry, there's no next step to law firm, it's just going to not need those lawyers. And it's going to be like that for every industry. And then in the future you probably won't even need the overseer once you're confident it'll get it right, just like how we don't double check excel spreadsheets calculations by hand. And even the things that this response is trying to say is uniquely human like ""creativity, critical thinking, and emotional intelligence"", are not safe, and there are already machines that can be creative (with art, music, design).

This only takes snapshots so would have been OI from close yesterday. But holy moly look at 400c mountain. 

Want to know why spy loves 400 just look at this graph. Minimal hedge to the downside against absolutely shrek hulk dong of hedging to 400.

But now its struggling to break above. Why? Because you don't need to hedge a call past its strike. So unless call inflow pushes this up higher the expected direction over the day should be a slow bleed down. Theta will start to strip off the impact these positions have today. 

Remeber this ENTIRE GRAPH strips 100% of the extrinsic value off over 6.5 hours. Billions of notional that have been hedged today on clock.

My shitty small apartment was $750 in 2014 and it was up to 1650 as of our last rent payment ..... I feel that rising rent pain and that's another reason my wife and I decided to buy our house. It's a large purchase but the mortgage is almost half of our old rent. We are looking to save some money and eventually build back our nest egg.

As far as the future - you can listen to 15 analysts and you will get 15 different predictions.  But, both Dalio and and Jeremy Grantham believe there is more pain to come.  Not sure in what form that will be (another Black Swan event or perhaps a slow grind as investors begin to wrap their heads around the shrinking margins companies will face in the future) but - that both say another 20 - 50% could come out of the market.  That said - if you have a timeline more than 10 years out - I wouldn't worry about it.  Pick some very good stocks, buy and hold.  I was strongly considering Meta when it dropped below a 100 and TSLA when it dropped to 100 and passed on both.  Kicking myself now - but oh well.  I would consider picking up some good stocks and start dollar cost averaging in.  Buy dips and if the market suddenly tanks - put everything left into those same stocks.  Buffet isn't a fan of selling his holdings (he will but not too often).   He takes all the dividends from his diverse holdings and uses that cash to pick up stocks on the cheap or add to his holdings on dips.

399,CAN," Im not sure what we were trying to accomplish in Afghanistan but whatever it was we failed.


Was it going after Bin Laden ? Well he died when ? And when did we leave ? So what were we still doing there 12 years after his death ? 


Next question. Is how are you judging if Russia is winning or losing in Ukraine ? 


If youre talking about total deaths. Then I guess youre right however, I dont think Russia is judging their win/loss based on death count. They want land. 


https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/36a7f6a6f5a9448496de641cf64bd375


This is as of yesterday the current occupation of Ukraine. As you can see Russia has invaded and occupied nearly 15% of Ukraine. 


Ukraine wants all of Ukraine back including Crimea which they have yet to do. Hopefully they succeed in the next counter offensive thats coming. However as of today I would say both Ukraine wouldnt claim to be ""winning"". 


Ukraine nor Russia give casualty numbers. All numbers are estimates. 


I think the current estimates are something along the lines of 180k Russians to 100k Ukrainians. 


I think also you should take in consideration what kind of Russians have been killed.


Yes Ukraine sneak attacked and caught Russia off guard in the initial invasion. I think 30% of Russian deaths came that first month. Since then Russia has changed strategy.


Russia wasnt prepared for NATO to send weapons and assist. And yes it hurt Russia very bad. But they have yet to show any signs of this ramping down. In fact the opposite. 


Russia only conscripted Thier ethnic minorities and criminals. They havent conscripted anywhere near what they CAN conscript.


Reddit and western media does not show any ""wins"" that Russia recieves only their losses.


Ukraine has restricted their males from leaving the country. Why do you think they did that ? Ukraine is conscripted also but the total numbers havent been released.


NATO is having issues keeping Ukraine armed. They are practically begging for weapons nearly every week. 


Russia is wanting a prolonged war hoping NATO stops their support while practically daring NATO or any NATO members to enter directly. They literally took down a US drone in the black sea and now its reporting that US is changing their drone routes because of it. 


The US can not stop all the interested countries from using a different currency. 


What would we realistically do vs those countries ?


China and India alone account for nearly 3 billion people. 


The US is winding down manufacturing in China to move it to.... India. Where do we manufacture if not India because we go to war to stop them ?


What happens if OPEC Russia Iran Mexico and others stop selling the west oil or jack up prices ? 


Now I dont anticipate India and China teaming up or getting along. But also would never have guess Saudi and Iran would either.



So im curious how do you think the US or the west would prevent all this ?


And do you have any clue how many Americans would die in a war on the scale youre suggesting US would do to prevent them from moving on from the dollar ? 


I guess you could argue we just launch nukes. But then everyone loses. 


How would we even attack Africa, Iran, Russia, China, Mexico, Turkey, India. NK all at the same time ? How much thought have you actually put into this ?",TheNBGco,0,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/125uou7/historical_revolt_against_dollar_a_financial/je6hu5o/,0.163,0.753,0.084,-0.9963
