253,SNDL," [Here's some DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/liiuko/exposing_sundial_growers_ticker_sndl). It was posted after the run up to $4.87 during premarket. However then it was only a 50% loss compared to your current 82% loss.

The industry may be fine (once weed gets legalized in the US there will be a lot of sink-or-swim once competition that will probably weed out those who can't compete) and may have a lot of room to grow, but SNDL likely isn't it.

SNDL's currently trading under $1, which is the minimum requirement to trade at to remain on Nasdaq. This means they have 3 options

* Somehow trade above $1 (their history of issuing stock any time the price jumps high doesn't help them here)
* Reverse split (which basically admits that under normal conditions they can't actually trade above $1)
* Trade OTC (which well... doesn't bode well for their future)

There are plenty of legitimate weed companies you could throw money at if you want to play growth in this industry.",justcool393,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mt6bam/yolo_will_you_ever_come_back_to_me_apes/guyzmrp/,0.05,0.877,0.073,0.5778

362,GME," Disclaimer: This is not financial advise, I'm a random on the internet feeling more bearish than bullish on this stock, seeking to understand why wsb is bullish.

Here: https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1801170/000119312521029637/d66346dex991.htm

>1. Did Chamath and/or Clover know about the ongoing DOJ investigation? If so, why was it concealed from investors?

>Chamath and Clover were fully aware of the DOJ inquiry.

>To be clear, Clover does not believe it is, or has been, in violation of any rules or regulations related to the inquiry.

>We went through both an IPO and de-SPAC due diligence process, and this subject received extensive focus and attention. Consistent with the views of Clover’s outside counsel, Social Capital’s outside counsel, and independently retained outside counsel of third parties, including IPO underwriters’ counsel, we concluded that the fact of DOJ’s request for information was not material and was not required to be specifically disclosed in our SEC filings.


Per best practice if it's a question as part of an IPO you disclose it to prevent this exact issue coming up. If courts find that it needed to be disclosed clover will lose a class action, which will impact their operating capital, they do not have much and frankly do not have many resources to contest this as the firm bringing the case is legitimate and not a small shop.


Another issue is regarding revenue income sources of clover and the ownership of Seek Insurance.

>5. Clover’s subsidiary, Seek Insurance, claims on its website “We don’t work for insurance companies. We work for you” despite literally being owned by Clover, an insurance company. What is your response?

>While Seek is an affiliate, as we said, it operates separately from Clover, with its own financing and its own goals, which are to provide neutral, objective advice to Medicare eligibles and to empower, educate and assist them.

If inadequate seperation is found (extremely likely, seek has falsely presented itself and is 33-66% owned and controlled by clover) clover will potentially lose one of its better long-term exposure and recruitment methods (13.5% of seek insurance transactions wind up with clover).

Lastly there is some potential funny business with B&H and the DOJ is investigating illegal kickbacks, this shit if true sinks companies.


>6. How much has Clover paid B&H Assurance, the undisclosed outside brokerage firm run by Hiram Bermudez (its Head of Sales) since inception?

>Clover has paid approximately $160k directly to B&H since 2017.

>7. What portion of Clover’s business has been referred by B&H Assurance since inception? How many members?

>Approximately 8,200 of our current members were referred by B&H Assurance to Clover.

Sections 8 & 9 seem extremely dodgy to me, this needed full disclosure at IPO imho and should never have been a thing or question in a formal enquiry.

This reads very much like he said she said, my takeaway is that it's an artifact of kickbacks and/or an attempt to hide a conflicting relationship thinly veiled by a ""how dare you suggest that"" defence.

There are some further revenue discrepancies and product uptake concerns in section 12, the public statement is ""92% of onboarded physicians use our kit"" is shit. Section 12 discloses actual use of their software is 22% of physicians. That's a 5th of the uptake than previously disclosed. Ignoring their damage control number (22% of physicians its intended for use are live) the actual factual number is 4% of their staff are live on the platform. This undermines the shit out of section 11 where they state they don't upcode as the platform isn't meant for upcoding. Upcoding been another item they're been investigated for doing.


Tldr: They look dodgy as fuck, their financials could very well take a massive hit due to real and valid litigation and ROE is rediculously bad for them as even a short term pick. 

36% short is high but I don't think there will be much of a squeeze as I don't believe they're a viable business with this much bullshit lined up against them.

I also think this time the shorts are hedged properly, to use GME as an example that was 140% short, this is only 36%. And vanguard owns 18% of it, that's 50% of the current short volume they can loan for fees to short sellers to reduce exposure.

If vanguard affiliates own short positions they've already covered 50% of their positions.

Yes there is potential but I think the rocket will blow up on the platform or fizzle.",BeardedCuttlefish,6,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mt3oba/clov_degenerates_be_careful/guy9w7l/,0.054,0.905,0.041,-0.9156

365,IMO," Assuming the companies response is valid, the DOJ question is null.  Are any class-action suits brought up by companies that don't have the resources to follow through?  Honestly, it's the most WS thing I've seen.  File a class action.  Lawyers make millions, shareholders get .001/shr.  


The issue with Seek seems like a non-issue to me.  They received 13% of the revenue generated by Seek.  If it were closer to 70%, yeah, that'd be a red flag.  But most of their business went to non-affiliated companies.  Hard to prove, IMO.  


The B&H seems the most likely to disappear.  And it seems you think so too since you didn't even include their response.  If nothing else, it would be a small fine and a slap.    


I'll look into their other revenue discrpeancies later.  In the short term, I think this goes higher.

Other than that.  I don't think you're quite a ""random on the internet"".  You got some cynical talents I don't have.

499,DD," I'm not reading any of that, since a quick glance up at the end I see ""I won't go into fundamentals"" and I saw the word ""squeeze"", which tells me all I need to know about this DD.  Especially with a title that includes the words ""very thorough"".

&#x200B;

All you need to know about this company is this:

&#x200B;

* It's one of Chamath's many, many scammer endeavors
* There is a significant amount of short interest, which makes it a very volatile stock
* Volatile stocks based on this thesis are great for intraday scalps but are not investible.  Like, really great.  However, you will never see a significant gamma squeeze like you saw with Gamestop in early January, as most of the shorts are sitting in the $8-$9 range already, and thus aren't feeling any squeeze pressure.  This, for the record, is why the modern day Gamestop squeeze theory is complete garbage and fatally flawed.  Those shorts are all comfortably sitting at $350-400.  Not $3 like they were at the turn of the year.
* You should never hold this stock.  Ever.  If you want to trade it, put it on a watch list and if you see it starting to go parabolic, scale in for the ride up, and either use your ""Travelcenters of America"" (using that from now on cause the automod bans me when I use the acronym for technical analysis for quoting a sub billion company) skills to identify where the peak is (it's usually somewhere between 9 and 11 dollars) or else guess and hope for the best, then sell your calls right as the volume starts to dry up a little bit.  The trade should take no more than half an hour.
* Immediately go short and let it retrace at least 50% of the way back down.  If you're good with Travelcenters of America, you can probably let it retrace 80%.  If you were shadowing me yesterday, you saw me call a top at $10.02 (I was 1 cent off, sue me), told everybody to go into 5/21 9p's, and had them hold to $8.32 (so I was 4 cents off on the downside, double sue me).  Which means if you played my shadow right, you were in that trade for 2 hours, entered in your put at $1.30 and you exited at 1.70.  Intraday like that is the only worthwhile way to play this ""company"".
* If you ""just like the stock"", you might be the bad kind of retarded.

&#x200B;

Just my humble opinion.  I could be wrong....but it's really unlikely.

&#x200B;

All my love

In like the very beginning of February last year I took my $4k I had saved up and saw people making shit loads here so I ballsed up and learned how to start trading options. In my first big trade I made $1300 off of SPCE in the golden days. Little while later, the market began crashing on feb 21st. News about coronavirus came out saying it has a high chance of spreading to America. Wsb was chaos, it was clear this drop was not the end. It only took me about 3 hours to realize that pure spy puts were the move. Made $18k off of it, more money than I’ve ever had in my whole life. I could pay off my student loans right then and there. Instead of doing the smart thing and taking some profits, I decided to stop reading posts from wsb and trade on my own. Within like a week the puts I had got wrecked and it was clear they would expire worthless. Slowly I watched that money burn up into nothing. 

But god damn was it fun as fuck, my favorite day was when I woke up and saw I was up $10k within the first 10 minutes of the market being open.

612,PM," I've read the other posts and the comments in the other posts but I still think I'm a bit confused, hopefully you can help me understand.

So, first, I think I understand that as the market goes up, your leverage decreases and so you then use that leverage to buy more, that's the compounding part, right? But if it goes down, and you need to sell to maintain your leverage ratio, I guess it may not necessarily be at a loss due to overall cost basis, but it certainly could be, no? And if you're buying more on the way up, that just turns it into a wash sale, unless you wait 90 days which seems like way too long to rebalance. But you're not selling on the way up, so where are the profits coming from? Solely unrealized gains? So what am I missing/not understanding here?

Also you've mentioned this *could* be done with a smaller portfolio, but afaik, portfolio margin needs 100k minimum. I read in another comment you mentioned selling puts when the account was closer to 50k, but that doesn't generate buying power like selling a box spread with PM does, so I'm confused here as well, and almost all of those tickers have very very poor option chains with no liquidity to sell puts on anyway.",Broncosoozie,15,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mt0ec3/wsb_leveraged_smartbeta_update_now_up_350k_108/guwvtfy/,0.08,0.808,0.112,0.8318

616,IBKR," Some questions, hopefully I am not too late to this post:

1) If you are selling equities to keep leverage from going over 2.2, won't that cause inefficiencies where you have both cash and debt (thru the short SPX boxes)? Or do you also buy back boxes when selling equities after a drop to reduce your cash balance?

2) Is there any reason to prefer larger spreads on the short boxes vs buying more short boxes (or the other way around)? Or does it make no difference? Some of your spreads are quite large, but I would imagine shorter spreads and more short boxes would allow you to buy/sell options that have greater volume?

3) Do you always buy the boxes with expiration dates out as far as possible? If so, why not earlier dates to get better borrowing rates?

4) What happens at the expiration date? Can you just let the box expire, or do you have to buy it back?

5) Are you worried about IBKR selling legs from the short box and causing your portfolio to implode?

6) What are the criteria that would cause you to reduce or entirely remove leverage? Specifically, if rates were higher, you had no income, or you hit some portfolio size would you delever? Or would you continue the strategy in any of those scenarios?",ZKnight,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mt0ec3/wsb_leveraged_smartbeta_update_now_up_350k_108/guyydoi/,0.045,0.903,0.052,0.5803

619,PM," If you sell to control leverage, then by definition, there will be positions that have unrealized losses that you can sell. You'll have to think about it a bit to convince yourself but it's mathematically true. If you need to buy again and only recently sold, just buy a similar-enough ETF to avoid the wash sale. Or buy more of the other ETFs already in your portfolio that you haven't sold recently. It is more important to get the leverage-stock ratio right, than the specific ETF ratios.  
Profits come purely from unrealized gains and a little bit of dividends. This is very tax-efficient. You can see my unrealized gains thus far.  


PM is ideal because you can sell SPX for cheap financing. Otherwise, just use regular margin with a smaller account. I'm surprised I recommended selling puts, but I take it back if I did. That's very tax inefficient and would have to be on the S&P 500 only (low diversification).

654,ICE," Lordstown performed as expected. A virgin team with an untested truck didn't finish and had technical and navigation issues. 

Anybody that follows this racing is not shocked. Anybody else is going to find exactly what they wanna see in the results. Tesla fans are going to say it's the end of hub motors and how a Tesla would have done better, ICE fans are going to claim that this proves EV is not an option, Lordstown fans are going to say it's the start of something great but have some teething issues to work through. Lordstown showed up, where was Tesla or the Hummer EV? So short term this only reinforces what they already believed.  Only thing that would have changed this is a win. 

Long term one race means even less.  I mean without Googling it where did the Ford Bronco R finish in the BAJA 1000 in 2019? It was a total disaster. And people are still excited and they still sell every one that they can build. 

Next short Score race is the Baja 400 in September, Best in the Desert has a few shorter races starting in August. If they enter those and DNF that's when you start to worry.

699,PSFE," But isn't the profit available to reinvest is the **net** profit (aka net income) though, not the gross? The net is what is left after paying for all costs incurred by the company (which you stated, so I'm not sure why you aren't using it). Using your mindset from the post of ""How many years to recoup the cost of buying the entire company"", the net profit is what you could put in your own pocket to make back your money.

Net income (or rather, net income per share) is also the metric used to calculate P/E ratio, which means that your value of 10.8 in the top post is incorrect. PSFE had a per share profit of -$1.01 for the most recent quarter, which means they have a P/E ratio of (price/share) / (income/share) = $13.59/-$1.01 = **-**13.5.

By the way, Paysafe has had increasingly negative net profits since 2018. However, a main driver of that appears to be depreciation of assets, impairments, etc. Revenue and EBIT (except for COVID) are increasing every year, so profits could well become positive soon enough as those negatives drop off the sheets.

Projected $1.5 billion revenue, $362 million free cash flow, 30-35% margins, $105 billion transactional volume for 2021. They generally have much better cash flow than fintech competitors.

Paysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples:

EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09

EV/Rev ratio : $83.91

EV/FCF ratio : $87.86

Average: $97.95

Valuation notes:

1. Based on low end of Paysafe's projections
2. From   published data on PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm,   bill, GPN, Paysign with a collective revenue growth rate of \~12.5%.   Paysafe’s 10.6% rev growth projection (conservatively pegged to   fintech/online commerce) excludes planned inorganic growth and projected   10X iGaming growth (55% CAGR)
3. Around half of these competitors report negative free cash flow and negative EBITDA growth, unlike Paysafe

727,HRC," There is truth in this comment response but also misinformation.

A little over a year ago, $CLF produced zero steel as they were only a mining company. The vast majority of ""dilution"" being mentioned is primarily from acquiring $AKS and $MT's USA assets over the last year to become the largest HRC steel producer in North America. This occurs with most acquisitions... for example, $AKS shareholders would be pissed if they didn't get $CLF shares when they were acquired.

Thus comparisons against historic pricing for $CLF by itself are indeed very flawed. One would need to include $AKS and the portion of $MT's USA assets as part of any historical analysis. But ""dilution"" by itself isn't an answer as the company is now three companies in one. This is why $CLF's revenue is expected to be 1,000% higher this year than the previous year.

At present, $CLF's [guidance](https://www.streetinsider.com/Corporate+News/Cleveland-Cliffs+%28CLF%29+sees+Q1+2021+adjusted+EBITDA+of+approximately+%24500+million/18197647.html) for the year has the company earning EBITDA profit of 40% of its current market cap this year alone. What kind of valuation one wants to give the company is indeed up for debate. Note that guidance is based on 2021 HRC pricing average of $975 and future contracts currently have that average at around \~$1250.

797,TSLA," For the TSLA 🌈🐻s rooting for car accidents. No, unless investors are nuts, it won't impact shit since there's no liability for Tesla (thus nothing to discount from the SP) and headlines do mention that there was no driver. The autopilot (not even FSD) was designed as a driver-**assist** feature and Tesla explicitly tells you that you need an attentive driver on the driver's seat with both hands on the wheel. This is just your usual TSLA FUD pushed by the 🌈🐻 TSLAQ cult.

Do you blame automakers when a drunk driver dies in a car accident? It's worse because in this case those retards didn't even have a driver on the driver's seat.",AlmightySnoo,7,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mtk7tt/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_april_19_2021/gv096mw/,0.21,0.767,0.023,-0.9634
