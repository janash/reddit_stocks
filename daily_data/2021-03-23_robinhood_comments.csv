You need to have 100 shares of XYZ to sell them if the call is exercised. This is why you need to own the shares.

 If you have $1000 on RH and XYZ is at $10. and you don't buy 100 shares of XYZ but you sell a $15c expiring at the end of the week. You might think have enough collateral at that moment. But if XYZ goes to $20. Then you need to find 100 shares of XYZ to sell to the person who exercised the contact, but you only have $1000. You buy 100 shares of XYZ at $20 = $2000.
