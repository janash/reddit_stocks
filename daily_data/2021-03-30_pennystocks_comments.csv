13,IMO," Personally I'm not a believer in EEENF, sooo many shares, very few institutional investors, seems like they're outsourcing the remaining site validation to the big players via farm-out so I'd imagine they're going to drop their % of the acreage they're going to directly drill themselves, and pass-throughs for usage aren't as much $$$ as the amount of oil they *could* be exploring. 

Factor in talk of ending subsides for ONG as part of the infrastructure package & I dunno, invest with some caution, or have an exit plan IMO. 

Regardless of what I said above it probably climbs until the wire logging news comes back... too many people too excited for it to drop in my mind. 

One thing to watch might be institutions getting in; funds that invest in natural resources acquisition, mining, drilling, processing. If the opportunity is now real you'd think they'd get in too, right?

As Toy Story 2 was hitting, it took off. So i scrapped up another 600 and bought more. It split (i learned what that meant), took off, split again etc. Then it got bought out, by some lame duck co, that does nothing but pay a divi and sit there... name was DIS. I forget the exact price they swapped me for, $30-50 a share or so. So i was college rich, cashed out my 1.6k turned into 26k... built a new pc, went to Florida, bought some dope, work on car etc. A fool and his money are soon departed...talk about ""loss porn""... pull the chart on disney since pixar aquisition.

19,BB," In short no, not every stock is a winner.

Sounds like some more patience and research should be your first step.

20,BNGO," There is an opportunity cost of holding onto a red stock if more money can be made elsewhere. 

But are you red because you picked garbage companies? Or because the story you believed in hasn't had time to come true?

I bought a lot of the meme stocks last June. Sold them after holding for a few months and for the most part it was a good idea to sell, but a few that I held blew up months later. For instance I had MRS at 0.09 and has hit $1, and I held BNGO at 0.70 which has hit $15, and bitf I flipped from 0.60 to $1 but if I had held a few more months I would've ridden the train to $6.

Those are three examples that blew up but if I looked at all the pennies that I have either held or seen shilled on the reddit penny boards overall most are pump and dumps. 

So look at all those companies you invested in and decide which ones were you just having fomo and which ones just haven't had time to mature.",Lurkuh_Durka,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/mg4iu5/is_selling_in_the_red_stupid_even_if_you_feel/gssc24c/,0.02,0.926,0.055,0.644

22,DD," If you did your DD, and believed in the company at a higher price, What changed your belief? If nothing then it often makes sense to buy the dips and hold.  If you’re only selling because the price drops, then ask yourself why you bought to begin with and if that reason aligned with your overall strategy.  If you were looking for a short term flip, then it may make sense to bounce, if your DD said this was undervalued than make your decision off that.",kamak0290,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/mg4iu5/is_selling_in_the_red_stupid_even_if_you_feel/gstg8c9/,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
23,NOVN," I started around that time. I am about even right now. I averaged down and have been gradually selling off positions when they run and I've averaged down enough for an overall green sale.

There's also a few like NOVN, NBRI, and CZNI that I have been getting in and out of every week or so at around 20% gain each time. NOVN, for example, I bought again the other day at 1.37 and sold today at 1.66.

Edit: And if any of your purchases are sold red even if the average is lower/green, you might not want to buy that stock again for another 30 days, because it will mark it a ""wash sale"" and add that negative amount to your next purchase, putting you in the hole from the beginning.",SunshineCat,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/mg4iu5/is_selling_in_the_red_stupid_even_if_you_feel/gstmr6r/,0.037,0.918,0.045,0.2448

Extract

As mentioned before, the acquisition isn’t expected to change the way in which Fortress operates on a day-to-day basis. The move has precipitated one very big change, however—the company has been delisted from the NYSE, so it will no longer be publicly traded. Indeed, in an interview, [Wes Edens stated](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Wes_Edens) that the biggest change will be no longer making earnings calls. “We’re rooting for being private. I’m excited about that,” he said.

SoftBank has been in the news a lot lately, and that’s largely because of its headline-grabbing technology investment fund, the Vision Fund. Currently valued at around $93 billion, it is the largest fund of this kind ever to be developed. When word started to spread about [SoftBank’s acquisition of Fortress](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/fortress-investment-group), many wondered how the Vision Fund would come into play. However, it has been reported that Fortress Investment Group will work alongside the fund—not directly with it. Interestingly enough, the fund is operated by Rajeev Misra, who went over to SoftBank from Fortress a while back.

The acquisition of Fortress by SoftBank is the just the latest in a long line of major developments for the alternative asset management firm. The company operates a credit business as well, which is led by Pete Briger. It sold Logan Circle Partners, a fixed-income business that oversaw around $30 billion, to MetLife in a $250-million deal. In 2017, the company reported $215 million in profits versus around $16 million during the first nine months of 2016. This was largely because of the aforementioned sale of Logan Circle Partners, but it will be interesting to see how its acquisition by SoftBank will affect its success in the future.",Mouse_Numerous,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/mgn8lw/softbank_sits_on_billion_dollar_assets_controlled/gsu1fjh/,0.025,0.888,0.087,0.9601
208,CIDM," It has nothing to rebound on.

&#x200B;

Ok, let me explain what I mean by that. First I've been following CIDM for quite a while. I've had a lot of stocks and took advantage of the NFT craze to sell a few and cover costs. I still have some.

Now, there are 3 things for me that are important to have in mind:

1. The NFT thing is real but it means nothing. People got into the stock just because they heard NFT and a lot of people talking. It is gonna take a while, if it even gets there, to see NFT's in CIDM in action. Last week it had two days of almost 50% up in the pre-market, the prices were matched during the day and after that it started to go down. 
2. CIDM has been week after week showing good results and imo it has been showing a steady but good approach and is slowly growing. With that said, after weeks of constant good news the price was still going down due to the bear market we are in. And that brings me to my 3rd point
3. The market is kinda in the red for the past few weeks. Even with all the good news the stock is keeping its price and slowly going up. I don't think it will rebound to NFT values of last week any time soon.

My personal strategy is to rebuy the stocks I sold again, since I continue to believe that the company has what it takes to grow. But it will be a very steady and slow growth plus I've seen some people a bit bearish on CIDM and I understand their point of view (can find the links to the previous posts this was mentioned, sorry). Nevertheless, I'm still bullish on a long long term. For now, I'm hoping it will get down below $1,30 and thats where I come back in and buy more stocks :)",jpmonteiro_pt,3,/r/pennystocks/comments/mgi34z/anyone_else_think_cidm_will_rebound/gst564w/,0.004,0.887,0.109,0.9879
