7,HOOD," Tl;dr - buying hood sounds like a bet against dumb money - business that operates like gambling without the bad reputation of casinos.  


Not a fan o ARK's strategy, but I see why some might consider HOOD a good buy. Service is being build around the idea how stock market is like a casino. There are actual priests of this investment approach on certain forums! Sometimes you win, sometimes you loose but generally you shouldn't worry about it too much. When you loose (often) you loose pennies cause you don't operate with serious amount of money(this was always about retail), but when you win (rarely), you get 5x, 10x, 50x returns!  You need serious self control and/or basic understanding of math not to get optimism bias to eat your money. Once you get it on your phone you get more and more incentives to take a look into it, constant stream of feedback how someone else just made a bank and you could be next!  It's like being a gambler living in casino's basement.   


Think about the consequences of it. You expose mostly ignorant people to illusion that this is their chance to steal a piece of the pie from Buffets and Bezoses of the world. Do you think they're going to buy SPY and REIT with their weekly check? Money will flow to NKLA's and other snakeoil salesmen of this world offering get-rich-quick scams. No build-up, no slow dripping and increasing value just a cycle of putting money into loss. Even when some profit will be made i **bet** the money will be spend onto another high risk-high reward thing with impossible to predict movements encouraging them to trade as often as possible. 

Do you think people will know better and stop? Take a look at the lotteries, millions of people just donating their money just for this fantasy of winning anything. Putting this money on the market will increase their chance of actually winning by enormous extent, but unfortunately rarely enough to actually make a profit.

All this misery inflicted on user with slick design of an app, pushing them to trade as often as they can, opening to other instruments... you get the idea, the more time you spend in app the more app is worth, the more money is being made.",InvestmentUnlikely32,3,/r/stocks/comments/ouk7fb/ark_innovation_etf_bought_45_million_worth_of/h73cgi5/,0.111,0.707,0.181,0.9876

To Robinhood specifically, there is a degree to which companies that have proven innovation and continue to lead their industry in certain ways (I'm thinking exclusively UI simplicity and usability for RH) do get some benefit of the doubt, but it is entirely unclear how they would continue to innovate.

You ""time the market"" in every other aspect of your life.  You look for big discounts on Black Friday.  You sell your boat at the start of boating season instead of the end, so you can get the best price.  You buy some Christmas wrapping paper on Dec 27 when it's 80% off.  When a baseball card you own goes up in price, you sell it.  It's all common sense.

So why on earth would you not use sense with stocks?

Well, the main one is if you're flighty and random, and you're not paying good attention to the price ranges of your stocks or the economy.  Buying and selling blindly or randomly would be bad. 

But if you're paying attention, and you're disciplined, and you have sober strategies (such as your sell-after-26%-gain rule) then ""timing the market"" is probably a good idea.  It's what every expert on earth does.  

I believe every position should be well researched prior to buying, and then watched continuously.  You watch your pets and kids to make sure they're healthy, you should monitor your stocks too.  You should always have upper and lower exit strategies, and amend them over time.  ""I'll never sell AAPL"" is a bad mantra.  Instead could say ""I won't sell AAPL below $300"".

220,BABA," I didn’t say it was the right mentality at all. Just that this sub is hardly unique for that.

I can get advocating a DCA approach vs trying to time the market but it still just feels off to say something like this with what’s currently happening. The OP’s comment in particular sure doesn’t give that message. It reads less like “This dip is nice guys but considering it’s history, maybe it’s best to just buy at set intervals instead of trying to outplay the market” and more like “lol you clowns trying to buy now when this crud was so much cheaper back at this time”. It just wreaks of hindsight. Also ignores people’s individual situations. I didn’t have near enough spare capital then as I do as of the end of last month by which point it already shot up a ton. I am probably gonna count my blessings and try to buy smaller amounts at intervals to not totally miss out just like what I now do with my Roth but the way some of these posts come off just rubs me wrong. 

Again, it’s a lot easier to be giving this advice when it’s bounced back from such a low vs having dropped more. If someone tried to say the same crap about something like BABA they’d be laughed off the subreddit since it’s only dropped more.

229,AI," You're better off going for long term gains.  You can get 50-100% annualized returns with a holding period of between 3-18 months.  Any shorter term than that, and you're getting away from what humans are good at.  There are stock bots out there, AI trading machines like the medallion fund.  So if you get into day trading you end up competing against machines.  And we all know how deep blue did against Kasparov.  (CPU beat #1 chess player, 25 years ago).  

So what computers can't do very well and probably won't ever be able to do well is the buy and hold value approach.  Finding stocks that are undervalued, determining that the company will not go bankrupt and the market is over reacting to some catalyst, and getting in on the stock when the chart looks like absolute shit is where you'll make the most money.  As always it takes risk to get rewards, and balancing that and calculating that is part of what makes a good investor.

231,CD," Ok, there are a few issues here so let's break them down. 

first, don't invest in anything you don't understand. if you need a little more time to read and investigate, that's fine. this is the best intro to investing I've ever seen, a short pamphlet from an old firm called Davis Advisors https://www.davisadvisors.com/davissma/downloads/WGI.pdf

second, it's fine to just park that money in the bank for now. no rush. 

third, save an emergency fund before you invest. the usual recommendation is 3-6 months of your expenses. more towards 3 months if income and job are stable, more towards 6 if you've got a commission job. maybe just a few thousand bucks if you're still living with parents. 

if you're investing for the long-term, and willing to ride it out for several years or decades, any time is a good time to start. if you'll need any of this cash within 3-5 years, just park it in a CD at the bank. 

>was wondering if it's safe to invest in those stocks now?

>SPY, VTI, QQQ 

those are not stocks, those are collections of stocks. they're ETFs, exchange traded funds with hundreds *or* thousands of individual stocks. they're safer than individual stocks, because one company can go bankrupt or have a scandal ... but 500 companies are not gonna all have problems at the same time. 

plus, those are all basically the same thing. VTI is the entire US stock market. SPY is the S&P 500, which is most of the large companies and a bit of the middle size companies ... so this covers about 85% of VTI. QQQ is the Nasdaq 100, so it's the tech companies in VTI or SPY. look at the holdings, portfolio, or composition and you'll see the top stocks are virtually the same for those 3 ETFs. 

buying just SPY or VTI is a good start. if you're nervous, could just buy a few hundred dollars at a time and get adjusted or comfortable.

257,MRO," I fully agree, to me MRO specifically is very undervalued at its current share price, especially because the recent stagnation/decline in share price has not been offset much by positive MRO specific news, like dividend announcements or debt reduction, cost cutting, etc. It seems bizarre to me that it would move relatively in tandem with the rest of the oil sector, but that 1) the oil sector has been increasingly detached from underlying oil prices themselves and 2) MRO is increasingly detached from its underlying value as well. 

I would think that if the derivative stock price movements were based on apprehension in the oil market that oil prices would also reflect that apprehension, and on the flip side companies who have insulated their bottom lines from potential oil price drops would be fairing better, yet neither of those two things seem to be the case.

The only way I can make sense of it is that large investors are weary of jumping onto a short term gain with the oil sector because they don’t want the medium/long term potential losses from opec, but it seems strange to me that enough of them are staying out where it’s causing that much of a detachment from the underlying asset. 

For example: if you went to a banana vendor and he charged you 12 dollars for a banana, but there was a massive banana tree over your head that you couldn’t reach, you would know that at any point more bananas could fall all around and that 12 dollars would plummet, but for the time being you still have to pay 12 dollars per banana because the bushels on the tree haven’t fallen yet. So you pay that ridiculous price for the banana you need right now, but you’re not going to invest in that banana vendors business in the long term, because you know it’s only a matter of time until that bushel falls and once it does his business becomes a lot less attractive, and if whatever you had invested would then be worth a fraction of what it was. 

^^ That might be the most obvious thing in the world to 99% of people reading that but it helped me think about it differently so I figured I’d share. It also makes me question, why wouldn’t they jump in and get back out before the bananas fall/opec increases production?

258,MRO," Exactly. I have just been scratching my head for the past week confused at what is driving the price. Crude has made a great recovery yet refineries/producers are lagging behind. MRO I know has made it clear they didn't want to expand their wells or increase production, but was instead putting more towards potential payouts. So here you have a company with great numbers and steady recovery growth, but now it's lagging behind by 10-15% or more. I would have thought $13 at this point was still behind. So then I thought maybe it's the expected payout will be high enough to offset gains, but I would have assumed that would have been priced in for sometime or at least prior the recent OPEC meeting.

Crude is pushing past $75 right now and MRO and others like it are just stagnate. I had some options expiring in a couple weeks along with some other stocks in this same segment and I'm just really unsure of what to do. If prices go up a $1, which is still well below where I thought they would be, things would be fine.

Same as all the other brokerages that use PFOF. The government has pretty much made all the laws it's going to make about PFOF. It already doesn't allow brokers to harm customers using PFOF.

>All brokerages are now zero commissions on equity trading. Except like pinks and warrants.

Which means that Robinhood already won.

>Average account size and AUM is small at $80 Billion. Other brokers are managing $1.5 trillion+.

And they're worth a lot more because of it.

>Bad public opinion from both government and public.

Which will get better as people realize that Robin Hood did nothing wrong by doing things that brokers do everyday, like restricting trading on extremely volatile stocks. They're pretty much at the bottom in terms of PR. There's certainly no public information with any credibility that could make it get worse. As people realize then it's all a bunch of loudmouths on the internet trashing a company that was the middleman for their bad stock pick, the negativity will fade. And if Robinhood can do some innovative things that actually make life better for their customers, it could flip the scenario entirely.

>If they need to raise money, they can't do VC rounds now. They would have to do a share offering.

They just raised money, so that won't be any sort of problem for a very long time. And going to the public market isn't what you do when you've got quality story to tell the VCs.
