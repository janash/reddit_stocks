33,GME," First off,








>Robinhood users and force-sold their GME shares?





I have never seen anyone back this up on Reddit or otherwise. A Verge article that talks to a total of 1 person doesn't prove anything. Also, closing a trader's positions if they are using margin or implementing a strange option strategy is common practice by every single broker when markets get crazy. It is allowed and not illegal in any way. If they sold off actual shares and there was actual evidence of it happening to people then you may have an argument.







Second, 





>are you unaware that Robinhood turned off the buy button for Robinhood users









This also isn't illegal. And, Robinhood literally had to do this due to not being able to meet the new margin requirements set by the DTCC hours prior. Legally, all brokerages must clear their trades through a clearinghouse. So, either Robinhood breaks the law and doesn't clear their trades or it has to stop people from buying to lower the requirements. Pretty obvious choice and easily the right thing to do.






The point of the clearinghouse is to secure both sides of the trade. If a brokerage doesn't use a clearinghouse then there is a risk of you buying/selling a stock and getting nothing in return if the counterparty can't complete their side of the trade.",caraissohot,12,/r/stocks/comments/obdhf3/robinhood_to_pay_70_million_fine_after_causing/h3o7a2u/,0.064,0.83,0.106,0.8704

135,AIV," A sweet, 'widows n orphans, healthy, reliable, dividend monster, stock is akin to a bowl or scoop of luscious Blue Bell Ice Cream, or like a perfectly made, Pastrami sandwich, on Pumpernickel bread, with dill pickle spear.  You don't walk away mad, like when merciless, lying, promising, scorpion on the frog's back across the river, growth, momentum, meme, or sham stocks lie to you and then roundhouse kick you in the mouth for your stupid sins.

In these anti-Trump, anti-Clintonian, wild ride times, then I would strongly suggest a healthy high dividend stock you don't have to look at every day or night.  Think about it for just a sec.  Growth, Momentum,, and Crypto, are all over the friggin place, ricocheting all over the up and down markets.  WTH is the difference between that baby diaper present, Or the loyal, steady, dividend stock?  You might as well get that dividend, like the happiness of no longer having to go clubbing to find a mate, once you settle down and get married.

The dividend stock becomes like a wife, or husband.  Maybe you're not acting an A$$, out at the Roxburry, each night anymore, YET at least you lie down decently at night, next to your spouse, or significant other, and you know who the heck you are, or are not, with the morning light!

Brittish American Tobacco(BTI), ORC, OCCI, OXLC, HTGC, or my all time favorite, CLM.  GLO, GLQ, and GLV, or the Clough Closed End Funds, have super discounts, as their share prices hover below their Net Asset Values, which equals sweet highway robbery to closed end fund management company junkies.  Other good divs are: T; IBM; Broadcom; INTC; WELL; PEAK; MAA; SUI: SAN; NHI; O; STAG; ECC; NMFC; PSEC; ANLY; AGNC; PSEC; Pennymac; MIC; BRK.B; Brookfield; MAC; SPG; and if AIV ever cooks up their dividend again.

Crypto is NOT for me.  I hate the tax issues, and if I ever did it I would hold it long, like for years, possibly decades, since taxes $UCK.  These whippersnappers have this naive, vague, unsyllogistic, view, like Capin' Jack, or whatever, that they can just hack an oilfield pipeline, a turkey factory, whatever, and just get away with it by tracing crypto, as what they stupidly see as some 'anonymous drug payment system,' which is anything but.

They have never heard the term, 'block chain.'  Duhhhhhhh?  It is a friggin chain, people.  And its a taxable one, at that.  Crypto is BLOCKCHAIN.  IT is NOT anonymous.  If you want to do a crime, and get paid, get paid trans via a cash stacks jam packed briefcase somewhere, or get paid in gold bars, copper, silver, or paladium.  Don't get paid in crypto, since it is a chain, a chain that can be certainly traced via the 'block chain.'  If the IRS can trace it don't think their cousins, the FBI, CIA, or NSA, have no ability to.

REIT stocks, and closed end funds(CEFs), or closed end management companies, sound like they'd be matches made in Heaven for you.

If you want a blindfold go Growth, Momentum, EV, or Meme stock.  Or, throw it into crypto, like Ethereum, and forgot you even knew about it.  If you jump off the crypto high dive, then stay in it.  Don't sell.  Don't sell until you have well enough to pay a long-term gains tax on your crypto profits.

Hey, at least if it goes down, or just stays level, which Div stocks have Not been doing as of late(they've been going UP under Biden), you still get your dividend, quarterly, or monthly.  That's enough money that the DIV could pay a rent, pay some bills, or just buy some groceries, or fund some decent partying at home, for goodness sakes!

50K is a sweet A$$ed monthly, Or even quarterly, Gividend, if you stop to scratch your head and think about it for a sec.

See, all these young, crypto, whippersnappers have no foggy clue that each time they buy, and then sell, crypto at a profit, they therefore incur a short-term capital gain, and that that is taxed.  The level it is taxed depends upon their income level.  Now, if they hold the crypto for at least a year, then they only pay the smaller, long-term, capital gain on the profit.  I'm not sure whether you can deduct crypto losses as a short-term, or long-term, capital loss, or not?

Same thing, when people buy, or sell, stock, outside of retirement accounts, they incur one of four things: short-term capital gain; short-term capital loss; long-term capital gain, or long-term capital loss.

There is an old tradition on Wall Street called, 'Widows and Orphans Dividend STocks.'  Those were conservative stock that men would buy to financially protect their wives and kids, especially with all the extremely lethal world wars going on back then, and the lessons of the Great Depression.  These were rock solid, juicy, dividend stocks, which paid out divs reliably, and which either went level, a little down over time, or slightly up.  Picture the arch-opposite of mood swings and volatile growth or momentum shock stock.

Get a widows and orphans stock, one that you study first.  Look at one day, five day, one week, one month, six months, YTD, one year, five year, and MAX stock charts on it.

The best of both worlds is to find a unicorn widows and orphans stock you never have to touch, which oddly combines a bit of growth, with a tad of momentum, with a deep and prolific dividend that's always paid out and doesn't skip or disappear.

If you still doubt, pick up the phone, or email, and simply leave a message for your broker's secretary to have them call you back, or shoot out an email to them, and ask them their opinion on what stock they feel is best with 50k.  Be SURE to tell them, 'I want to pick this completely self-directed.  I'm tired of actively managed, fully diversified, funds I can't grab the steering wheel on.'

Oh, I almost forgot to mention.  Divs are taxed, but at a lower rate than anything as abserdly high as short-term gains, or even long-term gain.  They send you a convenient, easy to comprehend, 1099-DIV tax form, and if you use either Turbo Tax, H&R, or Intuit, its seamlessly easy.  No worries, and it just takes a little bit off of your refund, or adds a little to your taxes, but Nothing like outright gains costs.

Load up on a dividend stock that's so high you'd trust it like a spouse, or significant other, or soulmate, or best battle buddy, and then pop the cork to that five years old bottle of Merlot, or your favorite beer, or that bottom shelf Vodka, Gin, or Rum, that you mix with some Cranberry, or Pineapple juice and Coconut shreds, and Coconut juice.  


Then, wake up the next morning, and Google your Rambo dividend stock, which you'll notice doesn't cliffhang, doesn't Airborne Ranger parachutte outta  a C-130, and allows you to sleep at night, like a trusty Rottie, Pitt, German Sheperd, or Dobberman.

136,CIA," A sweet, 'widows n orphans, healthy, reliable, dividend monster, stock is akin to a bowl or scoop of luscious Blue Bell Ice Cream, or like a perfectly made, Pastrami sandwich, on Pumpernickel bread, with dill pickle spear.  You don't walk away mad, like when merciless, lying, promising, scorpion on the frog's back across the river, growth, momentum, meme, or sham stocks lie to you and then roundhouse kick you in the mouth for your stupid sins.

In these anti-Trump, anti-Clintonian, wild ride times, then I would strongly suggest a healthy high dividend stock you don't have to look at every day or night.  Think about it for just a sec.  Growth, Momentum,, and Crypto, are all over the friggin place, ricocheting all over the up and down markets.  WTH is the difference between that baby diaper present, Or the loyal, steady, dividend stock?  You might as well get that dividend, like the happiness of no longer having to go clubbing to find a mate, once you settle down and get married.

The dividend stock becomes like a wife, or husband.  Maybe you're not acting an A$$, out at the Roxburry, each night anymore, YET at least you lie down decently at night, next to your spouse, or significant other, and you know who the heck you are, or are not, with the morning light!

Brittish American Tobacco(BTI), ORC, OCCI, OXLC, HTGC, or my all time favorite, CLM.  GLO, GLQ, and GLV, or the Clough Closed End Funds, have super discounts, as their share prices hover below their Net Asset Values, which equals sweet highway robbery to closed end fund management company junkies.  Other good divs are: T; IBM; Broadcom; INTC; WELL; PEAK; MAA; SUI: SAN; NHI; O; STAG; ECC; NMFC; PSEC; ANLY; AGNC; PSEC; Pennymac; MIC; BRK.B; Brookfield; MAC; SPG; and if AIV ever cooks up their dividend again.

Crypto is NOT for me.  I hate the tax issues, and if I ever did it I would hold it long, like for years, possibly decades, since taxes $UCK.  These whippersnappers have this naive, vague, unsyllogistic, view, like Capin' Jack, or whatever, that they can just hack an oilfield pipeline, a turkey factory, whatever, and just get away with it by tracing crypto, as what they stupidly see as some 'anonymous drug payment system,' which is anything but.

They have never heard the term, 'block chain.'  Duhhhhhhh?  It is a friggin chain, people.  And its a taxable one, at that.  Crypto is BLOCKCHAIN.  IT is NOT anonymous.  If you want to do a crime, and get paid, get paid trans via a cash stacks jam packed briefcase somewhere, or get paid in gold bars, copper, silver, or paladium.  Don't get paid in crypto, since it is a chain, a chain that can be certainly traced via the 'block chain.'  If the IRS can trace it don't think their cousins, the FBI, CIA, or NSA, have no ability to.

REIT stocks, and closed end funds(CEFs), or closed end management companies, sound like they'd be matches made in Heaven for you.

If you want a blindfold go Growth, Momentum, EV, or Meme stock.  Or, throw it into crypto, like Ethereum, and forgot you even knew about it.  If you jump off the crypto high dive, then stay in it.  Don't sell.  Don't sell until you have well enough to pay a long-term gains tax on your crypto profits.

Hey, at least if it goes down, or just stays level, which Div stocks have Not been doing as of late(they've been going UP under Biden), you still get your dividend, quarterly, or monthly.  That's enough money that the DIV could pay a rent, pay some bills, or just buy some groceries, or fund some decent partying at home, for goodness sakes!

50K is a sweet A$$ed monthly, Or even quarterly, Gividend, if you stop to scratch your head and think about it for a sec.

See, all these young, crypto, whippersnappers have no foggy clue that each time they buy, and then sell, crypto at a profit, they therefore incur a short-term capital gain, and that that is taxed.  The level it is taxed depends upon their income level.  Now, if they hold the crypto for at least a year, then they only pay the smaller, long-term, capital gain on the profit.  I'm not sure whether you can deduct crypto losses as a short-term, or long-term, capital loss, or not?

Same thing, when people buy, or sell, stock, outside of retirement accounts, they incur one of four things: short-term capital gain; short-term capital loss; long-term capital gain, or long-term capital loss.

There is an old tradition on Wall Street called, 'Widows and Orphans Dividend STocks.'  Those were conservative stock that men would buy to financially protect their wives and kids, especially with all the extremely lethal world wars going on back then, and the lessons of the Great Depression.  These were rock solid, juicy, dividend stocks, which paid out divs reliably, and which either went level, a little down over time, or slightly up.  Picture the arch-opposite of mood swings and volatile growth or momentum shock stock.

Load up on a dividend stock that's so high you'd trust it like a spouse, or significant other, or soulmate, or best battle buddy, and then pop the cork to that five years old bottle of Merlot, or your favorite beer, or that bottom shelf Vodka, Gin, or Rum, that you mix with some Cranberry, or Pineapple juice and Coconut shreds, and Coconut juice.  


Then, wake up the next morning, and Google your Rambo dividend stock, which you'll notice doesn't cliffhang, doesn't Airborne Ranger parachutte outta  a C-130, and allows you to sleep at night, like a trusty Rottie, Pitt, German Sheperd, or Dobberman.

140,GLV," A sweet, 'widows n orphans, healthy, reliable, dividend monster, stock is akin to a bowl or scoop of luscious Blue Bell Ice Cream, or like a perfectly made, Pastrami sandwich, on Pumpernickel bread, with dill pickle spear.  You don't walk away mad, like when merciless, lying, promising, scorpion on the frog's back across the river, growth, momentum, meme, or sham stocks lie to you and then roundhouse kick you in the mouth for your stupid sins.

In these anti-Trump, anti-Clintonian, wild ride times, then I would strongly suggest a healthy high dividend stock you don't have to look at every day or night.  Think about it for just a sec.  Growth, Momentum,, and Crypto, are all over the friggin place, ricocheting all over the up and down markets.  WTH is the difference between that baby diaper present, Or the loyal, steady, dividend stock?  You might as well get that dividend, like the happiness of no longer having to go clubbing to find a mate, once you settle down and get married.

The dividend stock becomes like a wife, or husband.  Maybe you're not acting an A$$, out at the Roxburry, each night anymore, YET at least you lie down decently at night, next to your spouse, or significant other, and you know who the heck you are, or are not, with the morning light!

Brittish American Tobacco(BTI), ORC, OCCI, OXLC, HTGC, or my all time favorite, CLM.  GLO, GLQ, and GLV, or the Clough Closed End Funds, have super discounts, as their share prices hover below their Net Asset Values, which equals sweet highway robbery to closed end fund management company junkies.  Other good divs are: T; IBM; Broadcom; INTC; WELL; PEAK; MAA; SUI: SAN; NHI; O; STAG; ECC; NMFC; PSEC; ANLY; AGNC; PSEC; Pennymac; MIC; BRK.B; Brookfield; MAC; SPG; and if AIV ever cooks up their dividend again.

Crypto is NOT for me.  I hate the tax issues, and if I ever did it I would hold it long, like for years, possibly decades, since taxes $UCK.  These whippersnappers have this naive, vague, unsyllogistic, view, like Capin' Jack, or whatever, that they can just hack an oilfield pipeline, a turkey factory, whatever, and just get away with it by tracing crypto, as what they stupidly see as some 'anonymous drug payment system,' which is anything but.

They have never heard the term, 'block chain.'  Duhhhhhhh?  It is a friggin chain, people.  And its a taxable one, at that.  Crypto is BLOCKCHAIN.  IT is NOT anonymous.  If you want to do a crime, and get paid, get paid trans via a cash stacks jam packed briefcase somewhere, or get paid in gold bars, copper, silver, or paladium.  Don't get paid in crypto, since it is a chain, a chain that can be certainly traced via the 'block chain.'  If the IRS can trace it don't think their cousins, the FBI, CIA, or NSA, have no ability to.

REIT stocks, and closed end funds(CEFs), or closed end management companies, sound like they'd be matches made in Heaven for you.

If you want a blindfold go Growth, Momentum, EV, or Meme stock.  Or, throw it into crypto, like Ethereum, and forgot you even knew about it.  If you jump off the crypto high dive, then stay in it.  Don't sell.  Don't sell until you have well enough to pay a long-term gains tax on your crypto profits.

Hey, at least if it goes down, or just stays level, which Div stocks have Not been doing as of late(they've been going UP under Biden), you still get your dividend, quarterly, or monthly.  That's enough money that the DIV could pay a rent, pay some bills, or just buy some groceries, or fund some decent partying at home, for goodness sakes!

50K is a sweet A$$ed monthly, Or even quarterly, Gividend, if you stop to scratch your head and think about it for a sec.

See, all these young, crypto, whippersnappers have no foggy clue that each time they buy, and then sell, crypto at a profit, they therefore incur a short-term capital gain, and that that is taxed.  The level it is taxed depends upon their income level.  Now, if they hold the crypto for at least a year, then they only pay the smaller, long-term, capital gain on the profit.  I'm not sure whether you can deduct crypto losses as a short-term, or long-term, capital loss, or not?

Same thing, when people buy, or sell, stock, outside of retirement accounts, they incur one of four things: short-term capital gain; short-term capital loss; long-term capital gain, or long-term capital loss.

There is an old tradition on Wall Street called, 'Widows and Orphans Dividend STocks.'  Those were conservative stock that men would buy to financially protect their wives and kids, especially with all the extremely lethal world wars going on back then, and the lessons of the Great Depression.  These were rock solid, juicy, dividend stocks, which paid out divs reliably, and which either went level, a little down over time, or slightly up.  Picture the arch-opposite of mood swings and volatile growth or momentum shock stock.

Get a widows and orphans stock, one that you study first.  Look at one day, five day, one week, one month, six months, YTD, one year, five year, and MAX stock charts on it.  Feel comfortable with this one.  The best of both worlds is to find a unicorn widows and orphans stock you never have to touch, which oddly combines a bit of growth, with a tad of momentum, with a deep and prolific dividend that's always paid out and doesn't skip or disappear.

If you still doubt, pick up the phone, or email, and simply leave a message for your broker's secretary to have them call you back, or shoot out an email to them, and ask them their opinion on what stock they feel is best with 50k.  Be SURE to tell them, 'I want to pick this completely self-directed.  I'm tired of actively managed, fully diversified, funds I can't grab the steering wheel on.'

Oh, I almost forgot to mention.  Divs are taxed, but at a lower rate than anything as abserdly high as short-term gains, or even long-term gain.  They send you a convenient, easy to comprehend, 1099-DIV tax form, and if you use either Turbo Tax, H&R, or Intuit, its seamlessly easy.  No worries, and it just takes a little bit off of your refund, or adds a little to your taxes, but Nothing like outright gains costs.

144,MAX," A sweet, 'widows n orphans, healthy, reliable, dividend monster, stock is akin to a bowl or scoop of luscious Blue Bell Ice Cream, or like a perfectly made, Pastrami sandwich, on Pumpernickel bread, with dill pickle spear.  You don't walk away mad, like when merciless, lying, promising, scorpion on the frog's back across the river, growth, momentum, meme, or sham stocks lie to you and then roundhouse kick you in the mouth for your stupid sins.

In these anti-Trump, anti-Clintonian, wild ride times, then I would strongly suggest a healthy high dividend stock you don't have to look at every day or night.  Think about it for just a sec.  Growth, Momentum,, and Crypto, are all over the friggin place, ricocheting all over the up and down markets.  WTH is the difference between that baby diaper present, Or the loyal, steady, dividend stock?  You might as well get that dividend, like the happiness of no longer having to go clubbing to find a mate, once you settle down and get married.

The dividend stock becomes like a wife, or husband.  Maybe you're not acting an A$$, out at the Roxburry, each night anymore, YET at least you lie down decently at night, next to your spouse, or significant other, and you know who the heck you are, or are not, with the morning light!

Brittish American Tobacco(BTI), ORC, OCCI, OXLC, HTGC, or my all time favorite, CLM.  GLO, GLQ, and GLV, or the Clough Closed End Funds, have super discounts, as their share prices hover below their Net Asset Values, which equals sweet highway robbery to closed end fund management company junkies.  Other good divs are: T; IBM; Broadcom; INTC; WELL; PEAK; MAA; SUI: SAN; NHI; O; STAG; ECC; NMFC; PSEC; ANLY; AGNC; PSEC; Pennymac; MIC; BRK.B; Brookfield; MAC; SPG; and if AIV ever cooks up their dividend again.

Crypto is NOT for me.  I hate the tax issues, and if I ever did it I would hold it long, like for years, possibly decades, since taxes $UCK.  These whippersnappers have this naive, vague, unsyllogistic, view, like Capin' Jack, or whatever, that they can just hack an oilfield pipeline, a turkey factory, whatever, and just get away with it by tracing crypto, as what they stupidly see as some 'anonymous drug payment system,' which is anything but.

They have never heard the term, 'block chain.'  Duhhhhhhh?  It is a friggin chain, people.  And its a taxable one, at that.  Crypto is BLOCKCHAIN.  IT is NOT anonymous.  If you want to do a crime, and get paid, get paid trans via a cash stacks jam packed briefcase somewhere, or get paid in gold bars, copper, silver, or paladium.  Don't get paid in crypto, since it is a chain, a chain that can be certainly traced via the 'block chain.'  If the IRS can trace it don't think their cousins, the FBI, CIA, or NSA, have no ability to.

REIT stocks, and closed end funds(CEFs), or closed end management companies, sound like they'd be matches made in Heaven for you.

If you want a blindfold go Growth, Momentum, EV, or Meme stock.  Or, throw it into crypto, like Ethereum, and forgot you even knew about it.  If you jump off the crypto high dive, then stay in it.  Don't sell.  Don't sell until you have well enough to pay a long-term gains tax on your crypto profits.

Hey, at least if it goes down, or just stays level, which Div stocks have Not been doing as of late(they've been going UP under Biden), you still get your dividend, quarterly, or monthly.  That's enough money that the DIV could pay a rent, pay some bills, or just buy some groceries, or fund some decent partying at home, for goodness sakes!

50K is a sweet A$$ed monthly, Or even quarterly, Gividend, if you stop to scratch your head and think about it for a sec.

See, all these young, crypto, whippersnappers have no foggy clue that each time they buy, and then sell, crypto at a profit, they therefore incur a short-term capital gain, and that that is taxed.  The level it is taxed depends upon their income level.  Now, if they hold the crypto for at least a year, then they only pay the smaller, long-term, capital gain on the profit.  I'm not sure whether you can deduct crypto losses as a short-term, or long-term, capital loss, or not?

Same thing, when people buy, or sell, stock, outside of retirement accounts, they incur one of four things: short-term capital gain; short-term capital loss; long-term capital gain, or long-term capital loss.

There is an old tradition on Wall Street called, 'Widows and Orphans Dividend STocks.'  Those were conservative stock that men would buy to financially protect their wives and kids, especially with all the extremely lethal world wars going on back then, and the lessons of the Great Depression.  These were rock solid, juicy, dividend stocks, which paid out divs reliably, and which either went level, a little down over time, or slightly up.  Picture the arch-opposite of mood swings and volatile growth or momentum shock stock.

Get a widows and orphans stock, one that you study first.  Look at one day, five day, one week, one month, six months, YTD, one year, five year, and MAX stock charts on it.  Feel comfortable with this one.  The best of both worlds is to find a unicorn widows and orphans stock you never have to touch, which oddly combines a bit of growth, with a tad of momentum, with a deep and prolific dividend that's always paid out and doesn't skip or disappear.

If you still doubt, pick up the phone, or email, and simply leave a message for your broker's secretary to have them call you back, or shoot out an email to them, and ask them their opinion on what stock they feel is best with 50k.  Be SURE to tell them, 'I want to pick this completely self-directed.  I'm tired of actively managed, fully diversified, funds I can't grab the steering wheel on.'

Oh, I almost forgot to mention.  Divs are taxed, but at a lower rate than anything as abserdly high as short-term gains, or even long-term gain.  They send you a convenient, easy to comprehend, 1099-DIV tax form, and if you use either Turbo Tax, H&R, or Intuit, its seamlessly easy.  No worries, and it just takes a little bit off of your refund, or adds a little to your taxes, but Nothing like outright gains costs.

Best of Luck, and May the Stocks be With You!

Google search, or [MSN.com](https://MSN.com) search, 'Highest Dividend Stocks to Buy Today.'  Best of luck.  'But would you have any Grey Poupon?'  


Load up on a dividend stock that's so high you'd trust it like a spouse, or significant other, or soulmate, or best battle buddy, and then pop the cork to that five years old bottle of Merlot, or your favorite beer, or that bottom shelf Vodka, Gin, or Rum, that you mix with some Cranberry, or Pineapple juice and Coconut shreds, and Coconut juice.  


Then, wake up the next morning, and Google your Rambo dividend stock, which you'll notice doesn't cliffhang, doesn't Airborne Ranger parachutte outta  a C-130, and allows you to sleep at night, like a trusty Rottie, Pitt, German Sheperd, or Dobberman.

WTH is the difference between that baby diaper present, Or the loyal, steady, dividend stock?  You might as well get that dividend, like the happiness of no longer having to go clubbing to find a mate, once you settle down and get married.

The dividend stock becomes like a wife, or husband.  Maybe you're not acting an A$$, out at the Roxburry, each night anymore, YET at least you lie down decently at night, next to your spouse, or significant other, and you know who the heck you are, or are not, with the morning light!

Brittish American Tobacco(BTI), ORC, OCCI, OXLC, HTGC, or my all time favorite, CLM.  GLO, GLQ, and GLV, or the Clough Closed End Funds, have super discounts, as their share prices hover below their Net Asset Values, which equals sweet highway robbery to closed end fund management company junkies.  Other good divs are: T; IBM; Broadcom; INTC; WELL; PEAK; MAA; SUI: SAN; NHI; O; STAG; ECC; NMFC; PSEC; ANLY; AGNC; PSEC; Pennymac; MIC; BRK.B; Brookfield; MAC; SPG; and if AIV ever cooks up their dividend again.

Crypto is NOT for me.  I hate the tax issues, and if I ever did it I would hold it long, like for years, possibly decades, since taxes $UCK.  These whippersnappers have this naive, vague, unsyllogistic, view, like Capin' Jack, or whatever, that they can just hack an oilfield pipeline, a turkey factory, whatever, and just get away with it by tracing crypto, as what they stupidly see as some 'anonymous drug payment system,' which is anything but.

They have never heard the term, 'block chain.'  Duhhhhhhh?  It is a friggin chain, people.  And its a taxable one, at that.  Crypto is BLOCKCHAIN.  IT is NOT anonymous.  If you want to do a crime, and get paid, get paid trans via a cash stacks jam packed briefcase somewhere, or get paid in gold bars, copper, silver, or paladium.  Don't get paid in crypto, since it is a chain, a chain that can be certainly traced via the 'block chain.'  If the IRS can trace it don't think their cousins, the FBI, CIA, or NSA, have no ability to.

REIT stocks, and closed end funds(CEFs), or closed end management companies, sound like they'd be matches made in Heaven for you.

If you want a blindfold go Growth, Momentum, EV, or Meme stock.  Or, throw it into crypto, like Ethereum, and forgot you even knew about it.  If you jump off the crypto high dive, then stay in it.  Don't sell.  Don't sell until you have well enough to pay a long-term gains tax on your crypto profits.

Hey, at least if it goes down, or just stays level, which Div stocks have Not been doing as of late(they've been going UP under Biden), you still get your dividend, quarterly, or monthly.  That's enough money that the DIV could pay a rent, pay some bills, or just buy some groceries, or fund some decent partying at home, for goodness sakes!

50K is a sweet A$$ed monthly, Or even quarterly, Gividend, if you stop to scratch your head and think about it for a sec.

See, all these young, crypto, whippersnappers have no foggy clue that each time they buy, and then sell, crypto at a profit, they therefore incur a short-term capital gain, and that that is taxed.  The level it is taxed depends upon their income level.  Now, if they hold the crypto for at least a year, then they only pay the smaller, long-term, capital gain on the profit.  I'm not sure whether you can deduct crypto losses as a short-term, or long-term, capital loss, or not?

Same thing, when people buy, or sell, stock, outside of retirement accounts, they incur one of four things: short-term capital gain; short-term capital loss; long-term capital gain, or long-term capital loss.

There is an old tradition on Wall Street called, 'Widows and Orphans Dividend STocks.'  Those were conservative stock that men would buy to financially protect their wives and kids, especially with all the extremely lethal world wars going on back then, and the lessons of the Great Depression.  These were rock solid, juicy, dividend stocks, which paid out divs reliably, and which either went level, a little down over time, or slightly up.  Picture the arch-opposite of mood swings and volatile growth or momentum shock stock.

Get a widows and orphans stock, one that you study first.  Look at one day, five day, one week, one month, six months, YTD, one year, five year, and MAX stock charts on it.  Feel comfortable with this one.  The best of both worlds is to find a unicorn widows and orphans stock you never have to touch, which oddly combines a bit of growth, with a tad of momentum, with a deep and prolific dividend that's always paid out and doesn't skip or disappear.

If you still doubt, pick up the phone, or email, and simply leave a message for your broker's secretary to have them call you back, or shoot out an email to them, and ask them their opinion on what stock they feel is best with 50k.  Be SURE to tell them, 'I want to pick this completely self-directed.  I'm tired of actively managed, fully diversified, funds I can't grab the steering wheel on.'

Oh, I almost forgot to mention.  Divs are taxed, but at a lower rate than anything as abserdly high as short-term gains, or even long-term gain.  They send you a convenient, easy to comprehend, 1099-DIV tax form, and if you use either Turbo Tax, H&R, or Intuit, its seamlessly easy.  No worries, and it just takes a little bit off of your refund, or adds a little to your taxes, but Nothing like outright gains costs.

Best of Luck, and May the Stocks be With You!

Load up on a dividend stock that's so high you'd trust it like a spouse, or significant other, or soulmate, or best battle buddy, and then pop the cork to that five years old bottle of Merlot, or your favorite beer, or that bottom shelf Vodka, Gin, or Rum, that you mix with some Cranberry, or Pineapple juice and Coconut shreds, and Coconut juice.  


Then, wake up the next morning, and Google your Rambo dividend stock, which you'll notice doesn't cliffhang, doesn't Airborne Ranger parachutte outta  a C-130, and allows you to sleep at night, like a trusty Rottie, Pitt, German Sheperd, or Dobberman.

149,OXLC," A sweet, 'widows n orphans, healthy, reliable, dividend monster, stock is akin to a bowl or scoop of luscious Blue Bell Ice Cream, or like a perfectly made, Pastrami sandwich, on Pumpernickel bread, with dill pickle spear.

E-commerce: Amazon 
Cyber security: Crowdstrike 
Medical: JNJ 
Media/Entertainment: Netflix/Disney/etc 
Automotive: Tesla or you could just go with a legacy carmaker

Others say buy FAANG +M. Maybe they throw in PayPal or NVDA. These are great companies that make up a huge portion of the indexes and are great companies. However my only issue here is that they aren’t really a diversified group. Rates go up they all get hit. Money won’t be cheap forever and look what’s happened with cheap money in the last year or so. Also no one knows what regulations will come over several years to this group. Maybe nothing but maybe something.

The best answer lies in all of these to be honest. 
Have an index fund. 

Own a few of the big guys. AAPL, AMZN, GOOG, MSFT

Find some a group of diversified names that are solid companies. JNJ, POAHY, REGN, DIS, INTC, AMD, DISCA, BOA, MS

Have some plays for the future. CRWD, TAN, LIT

214,CAN," Obligatory reminder that a few random tips and a one week time horizon are not exactly rigorous, but... 

**The Reddit hate for Jim Cramer is so much based on disinformation and oblivious ignorance.** 

He's frequently and heavily misrepresented, especially here.  His crime?  When Game-st-p was at $378 he congratulated the meme'rs and begged them to take profits.  That's it.  And it turned out to be prescient advice.  Didn't matter.  

Cramer is a savant genius of certain subjects.  Please note that doesn't mean I'm saying he's a great stock picker.  I say it because people don't know his life story and his genius is what allowed him to absolutely smash multiple fields of education and speed run to the top of the what was the top division of the top firm on earth.  There, he crushed it as a fund manager and made a generational fortune pretty quickly.  The pressure and success made him a legendary wacko on Wall Street.

But he's also a narcissist and fancies himself as a teacher and journalist.  So putting that all together, he quit the traditional business and tried to become the Internet teacher/journalist of Wall Street, but did so right at the eve of the dot com bomb.  His idealism on that got pummelled.  

With enough money for life, confidence arising from past success, and the unstoppable drive for his journalism aspirations over Wall Street drudgery, he leaned in to any and all media he could.  Books, radio, tv, websites, satellite.  He couldn't say no to anything.  He's addicted to being heard.  

But his core message has always been exposing and denigrating the power imbalance of Wall Street, and how the stock market has always been the best and usually the only hope that the average person has to actually build and preserve wealth.  Yes, the deck is more stacked against the little guy, but it's still, by far, the best hope.  And Cramer views himself and his teachings as the edge that the little guy can have against that stacked deck.  

Forget all the BS you've heard about Cramer online.  Buy any of his books, and you'll get a very sane and sober and practical step by step of how the average Joe can utilize the stock market.  He's done more than anyone to blow holes in their conceit and their mystique.  Yes, a railroad worker CAN trade stocks.  Or a teacher.  Or whoever.  No, you don't need to be beholden to stuffy bankers and agents with esoteric products and who tut-tut that you don't have their pedigree.  

The bitterest irony is the most vocal haters, especially the ones on Reddit, are the independent retail traders that Cramer didn't just pave the road for, he demolished the countryside and levelled the ground and laid the foundation.  They're waking up and seeing a paved road and thinking they invented it.  Then they cluelessly see a grossly unfair or misrepresented video clip and they think they've caught a villain.  It's misguided social media justice warriorism on steroids.

240,AM," Yes, that is certainly one way of viewing things.  To be honest, I think the unfettered anything goes markets of the 1980s through 2000s are the culprits.   Too many future years of income were pulled forward while selling the benefits of just in time supply chains to reduce costs and gutting the productive capacity of the economy through offshoring and outsourcing to lower costs as ways to boost earnings and justify the higher valuations.   Then, the higher valuations necessitate, and are built upon, liquidation tactics and business plans to turn a profit.  

Technological change has played a large role as well.  Think of just one example-- moving from LPs to tapes to Cds then to mp3 players.  The three former all required basic materials and manufacturing for production, stores and sales people,  transportation jobs for moving to stores, and furniture at home for storage.  The manufacturing required machines/tools/consumables/maintenance, which all in turn had their own networks and needs. Vinyl, cardboard, plastic, resins, paper, artwork, and (shrinking) liner notes all turned into a download.  Enormous amounts of production, transportation, and sales jobs/infrastructure/capacity wiped out.   

You do the same to 100 other businesses and you have hollowed out the economy.  Think about all the capacity surrounding camera and film that has been wiped out-- plastics, chemicals, packaging, papers, developing companies, photobooks and storage, etc.    Initially the benefit was that it was cheaper, less materialistic, less bulky, more portable.  Then, just cost-- look at how cheap it is to stream instead of buy.  It is cheap.  It has to be-- wages across the country have not moved in nearly a decade.  And why should they?  Inflation has been low because of technology-- the technology that cuts your expenses has capped your wages as well.    

I AM NOT saying the old ways were ""better"" or should be brought back.   I am just calling attention to how much employment and production there used to be when download and streaming companies were not trillion dollar enterprises and millions were employed at living wage and better with multiple employer paid benefits.  We had millions of people producing tangible, exportable, goods.  Now we make sandwiches, clean hotel rooms, and wait tables as a ""core"" section of the economy, for less than living wages. 

Oh well.  I am sure the buggy and wagon manufacturers felt the same too.  It just seems like they actually had a boom of jobs and opportunities on the horizon.

That said, that's clearly not the case here. NIO very well may sell 5 million cars a year by 2030, but I've seen nobody explain why they would be able to sell them at higher margins.

Also, wtf do the stock price and stock splits have to do with anything? They're literally irrelevant for valuations and say nothing about a company.

Again, I DO think NIO is worth my time. I'm just trying to figure out why people think it's worth $90 billion. To make sure there's nothing I'm missing.

So far all you've given back to me is ""I bought low"", ""I think the share price will increase"" and ""the company will do well in the future"". What are the fundamentals why you think this company is worth well over $50B (which is roughly where you bought in at)? 

> I'm doing really well with it and have high hopes for the future.

Hope isn't a strategy, and putting money into a stock based on hope doesn't make you an investor, it makes you a gambler.

I ain’t a pro Soviet Union. Don’t get me wrong. My parrents were ok. They were the ppl who got green cards straight after the collapse of the Soviet Union so we were kinda ok.

You can’t pay salaries because u don’t sell the products because no one works for free. The country starts printing more and more money and etc. And from there u get the inflation. After that is hyperinflation. Then there is bankruptcy. I remember just gonna give u the example of bulgarian currency fliped in us dollars. Today the bread costs $0.45 tomorrow becomes $1 after 5 days $10 after thar they change the banknotes from 1 5 10 20 50 100 to 1000 5000 100000 20000 100 k. And one bread becomes 1000. Prices continue growing( now its private sector) money continue getting zeros on the back in one moment. The country decides to take a huge loan for 30 yrs. sell all government properties ( factories) to private foreign investors who actually bankrupts them for loans. From there you get the unemployment cause there is no where to work and then the loan which the country took makes to cover the major sectors. At this time 1 years passed.

No government production. Everything is privatised. So businesses starts moving. That’s the experience of hyperinflation. In American way is never gonna happen.

295,BABA," Free Model on Alibaba!

We are all aware that there are concerns with the company that have depressed the share price lately.  
  
Those concerns are surrounding the Ant post IPO valuation, further regulatory fines for anti-competitive practices, and a potential de-listing from US exchanges.  
  
I personally believe that these risks are over done.

Please take a look at the model and let me know if you agree with the valuation. 

The free valuation model on BABA is available here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zVtSHqOXCQevOdC4tFhUNhvzRjJloQJnJgBfCOehWQ4/edit#gid=1775597999

There is so much info in the model so if you'd like more information, I created a 6 part series, completely breaking down the company.   
  
That video series can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dZtt2xTm\_4

Its well below its ATH.

Closed many unprofitable locations, and remodeled other locations while foot traffic was low.  
  
Got rid of many unprofitable brands.  
  
Is focusing on and has begun to release their own vertically integrated brands which in turn will increase margin. They have released 5, with 3 more this year I believe. July is a storage brand which is great for back to school and all of this new home ownership.  
  
Over 2.5% insider ownership (CFO just bought 500k USD of shares in April at \~25 dollars a share to add to his 300,00 shares).  
  
Over 98.5% institutional ownership (Yes those add up to more than 100%).  
  
\~20% Short interest with 100 million share float.  
  
They are currently doing buybacks for the rest of the year.  
  
They had a dividend but removed it due to covid.

If shares hit $148, you get paid $148 per share.  An $11 per share increase in 10 days going with July 9 expiry.  $5,100 in 10 days. Now you can do same thing except take that your starting with 80,000

If price goes to $158, you get $148 and the gambler gets the stock at a great price. 

Pick a strike price you would be happy with, and a stock you would be happy keeping long term

Their partnership with Microsoft is them using a shit ton of Microsoft products and services. This may help the business, but its not like Microsoft is invested in GME lol. I read the press release and its basically gme saying they bought a bunch of Microsoft stuff. You know who else does that, every company on earth.

I said you were wrong, stores are an asset. These are not opinions, these are textbook terms.
