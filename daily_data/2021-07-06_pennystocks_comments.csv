If there is a large increase it will move the equity substantialy to match the yield. I'm also expecting to see their Q report announce at least 30 more workover rigs and 5-7 new wells completed.  

With those min numbers I see output being very high. The activity there is higher than I have seen in a long time which is what got me looking orginally. There is a good amount of debt to pay down on the Waddell ranch for new production should begin to offset this and we see forward looking yield. Of course any major jump in oil prices can add to a quick short term gain but I'm hoping for OPEC+ to come to an agreement and oil prices stabilize in the $70-75 with some pops above $85 and this play out grinding up through Aug or early Sept to my PT targets.",jim-and-pam,3,/r/pennystocks/comments/oelmbt/update_on_permian_basin_royalty_trustpbt_and_the/h495fxn/,0.018,0.866,0.116,0.943

Advaxis and Biosight Announce Entry into Definitive Merger Agreement

– Combined Company Will Operate as Biosight Therapeutics to Advance Pipeline of Clinical-Stage Oncology Programs with Lead Program Aspacytarabine (BST-236) in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) and Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS)  
  
– Combined Company Will be Well-Funded with Cash Position of approx.$50 Million Expected at Closing  
  
– Multiple Clinical and Regulatory Pipeline Milestones Planned for Combined Company Over the Next 12-18 Months

Advaxis, Inc. (“Advaxis”) (NASDAQ: ADXS) and Biosight Ltd. (“Biosight”), a privately held pharmaceutical development company developing innovative therapeutics for hematological malignancies and disorders, today announced that the companies have entered into a definitive merger agreement pursuant to which the shareholders of Biosight will become the majority holders of the combined company immediately following completion of the transaction. The proposed merger will create a public company that will prioritize the clinical advancement and commercialization of Biosight’s lead product, aspacytarabine (BST-236). The combined company is expected to have approximately $50 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at closing. Following the closing, which is expected to occur in the second half of 2021, Advaxis will be renamed Biosight Therapeutics and is expected to trade on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the ticker symbol “BSTX”.  
  
The combined company plans to advance its pipeline through multiple clinical trials, and anticipates the following milestones over the next 12-18 months:  
  
Topline results from the ongoing Phase 2 trial of aspacytarabine, which has completed enrolment, as first-line therapy in AML patients who are unfit for standard chemotherapy  
  
Recent data presented at ASCO showed that aspacytarabine achieved complete remission (CR) rates of 39% across all evaluable patients (n=46) with 63% of cases with negative minimal residual disease (MRD(-)) and median overall survival (OS) of 10 months at present (95% CI, 6- NR). Altogether these results are encouraging considering the high risk factors in this population at baseline;  
  
Results from the Phase 2 trial of aspacytarabine in collaboration with the European cooperative group, Groupe Francophone des Myélodysplasies (GFM) in patients with relapsed/refractory AML and higher-risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS);  
  
Initiation in the U.S. of a second, Phase 2 trial of aspacytarabine in patients with relapsed/refractory AML and higher-risk MDS;  
  
Results from the ongoing Phase 1/2 trial with ADXS-503 in combination with pembrolizumab in non-small cell lung cancer; and  
  
Results from the Phase 1 trial of ADXS-504 in biochemically recurrent prostate cancer  
  
“After an extensive and thorough review of strategic and potentially transformative options for Advaxis, we are very pleased to announce a proposed merger with Biosight,” said Kenneth A. Berlin, President, Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer of Advaxis. “We believe the combined company’s strong and diversified oncology pipeline with late stage and early stage assets, near-term milestones, seasoned leadership team and focus on both hematological malignancies and solid tumors have the potential to provide transformative benefits to patients while also providing value to our stockholders.”  
  
“The proposed merger with Advaxis is a unique opportunity for Biosight to build a leading public company in oncology, with a diversified clinical pipeline in both hematological malignancies and solid tumors. The combined company will have the demonstrated expertise and strong balance sheet to advance its lead programs towards multiple anticipated milestones over the next 12 to 18 months,” said Dr. Ruth Ben Yakar, CEO of Biosight. “I would like to express my deepest appreciation to the wonderful Biosight team, including Dr. Liat Flaishon and Dr. Shoshi Tessler who lead our R&D activities, and Dr. Stela Gengrinovitch, the founder of the company. The excellent work and dedication of the entire Biosight team enabled the significant achievements. I would also like to thank our Board of Directors and Shareholders for their support over the years.”  
  
About the Proposed Merger  
Pursuant to the merger agreement, Advaxis will acquire all of the outstanding share capital of Biosight in exchange for the issuance of newly issued shares of Advaxis common stock upon closing, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions, including the receipt of the required approval of the Advaxis stockholders and Biosight stockholders and certain regulatory approvals. Upon completion of the merger, Advaxis’s then-current equity holders will own approximately 25% and the former Biosight equity holders will own approximately 75% percent of Advaxis’s common stock, calculated on a fully diluted basis.",planikaraj,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/oemq9w/the_loungedaily_plays_july_06_2021/h49jdnv/,0.019,0.854,0.127,0.9974

161,EDIT," Well, it broke a penny but didn't stay there.  I'm hoping for a close above .0088, which I think is looking possible.  Over .009 would be even better.  

It ran well today with the 8-k.  

If we can hold over a penny, I think we can easily see a .03-.05 run when they go current.

EDIT: Looks like a close over .009 unless someone paints it down in the last five minutes.


EDIT 2: .009 on the dot, almost closed at .0092.  


Definitely thinking that .03 - .05 run is possible in the near future.  .05 would be nice, I could cash out a nice 25k on a $750 investment.  I've been holding since February, in at .0015.  Haven't taken any profit yet, this is the type of play I just like to yolo.

164,BDR," The timing would suggest that this jump corresponds to them announcing that [their PPP loans were forgiven](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/blonder-tongue-announces-forgiveness-cares-201500617.html) about an hour ago.

This is actually quite tantalizing info for me because another company I've had my eye on (SYPR) filed an [8-K last week](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/864240/000143774921016157/sypr20210630_8k.htm) saying the same thing, yet they haven't officially announced it via a press release yet. The filing states that they would announce it after their second quarter ended on July 4th, so it has to be imminent.

When I learned that, I searched for how these sorts of announcements generally affect stock price, but wasn't able to find anything substantive. However, BDR's price movement on the same news is quite encouraging. Idk if SYPR will also see a gap up of ~40% upon release of the news, but it's been primed for a breakout anyway so it very well *might*. 

Take all this with a grain of salt — this may just be a coincidence and not a general trend — I just found it interesting given the information currently available.

**EDIT**: Some other diverges — BDR has had $1.75M in loans forgiven whereas SYPR had $3.5M, about twice as much. However, BDR's market cap is only about one fourth of SYPR's, so it's quite possible that SYPR's price doesn't move as significantly as BDR's upon release of the news. I'm still quite intrigued by this as a spec play though.

**EDIT 2**: [BDR's corresponding 8-K](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1000683/000121390021035794/ea143758-8k_blondertongue.htm) says that they'd release a press statement (the news that just came out) following the conclusion of their second quarter on June 30, 2021, so perhaps that means SYPR's press release is due within the next few days?

179,AC," A couple of things. It's a speculative play that has massive potential if they can deliver.

1. Graphene. As the name implies, they produce graphene. They somehow managed to play with the dark arts and can/will produce industrial amounts of graphene via natural gas wizardry.

2. Lubes + coatings. Seems like a non-profitable venture. But they just signed a deal with Saudi Arabia for it. Apparently the coatings on AC units make a massive power consumption difference, which is big $$ if you try to cool big buildings in a desert (looking at you Arizona). Plus lubes that are good or something.

3. Down the list  but most important. Partnered with University of Queensland, who have chosen GMG as their manufacturer of the up and coming aluminium-ion batteries. 

3.2 They claim to have made a battery that can charge 60-70x faster than any lithium battery. Ie: phone battery will last 3 days, with a 1 minute charge. Cycle charge tests have just gone through 3000 full cycles with minimal reduction in battery performance, compared to the lithium packs that start severely sucking after ~1500.

3.3 Does not require the reinvention of mass production (eliminate 10 years of R&D). Buy/lease a battery plant, slap on your rollers and go.

3.4 Battery specs: go on their website. No cooling required. No heating required. No burst into flames hazard. Can be punctures and still not kill you.

3.5 Cheap to craft. Aluminium (most recycled material on earth probably), aluminium oxyde (something like that), graphene (that they produce) laced with UQ plasma hole cutter tech). No lithium, cobalt, copper, etc. Aluminium and graphene from natural gas.

3.6 They released they had 80 companies requesting more info with NDA's being signed. Dont quote me on the numbers, I'm on my phone. On their website I believe.

3.7 Prototypes for coin cells coming.. I'm gonna say Dec 21/Jan 22.

3.8 Plans for bigger pouches (EV/House packs) by 2024.
