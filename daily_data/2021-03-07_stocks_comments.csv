1,DD," So much doom and gloom. You said it yourself, the stock being most affected right now is speculative tech stocks that we all know is overvalued and everyone and their grandma expected to come back to earth eventually. 

I own zero speculative tech stock. My sea of red came back nicely to a see of green by end of Friday. 

I'm sorry to break it to you, but nobody is going to cry for people buying into companies that barely exist, sells nothing but has a market cap of xxx trallion gazillion dollars. Many of these companies being hyped into oblivion on Redditt are sure bets to be losers. For fuck's sake, I read a DD of a company who is not allowed to trade because of SEC violations and doesn't even have a functioning website. The comments were full of to the moon! and what a great DD and this awesome! 

There are great companies out there that will continue making money for you no matter what the Fed does on a macro scale. We are not heading into economic disaster. I don't know if anyone noticed, but we just had an entire YEAR of massive economic disruption and look where we are. We are doing great considering all things and we are getting back on track. 

I'm still waiting for that solid, convincing argument that a spike in inflation to 2percent (I'm sorry but my percent symbol key is broken) will cause a catastrophic collapse of the US economy. 2percent inflation is not a crisis nor is it a indicator that we're heading to catastrophic hyperinflation.

4,GDP," I think more questions need to be answered to understand the overall balance:

1. Who will sell the long term bonds? Institutions? Foreign holders? American People?

2. After those holders sell the long term bonds, what will they do with the dollars? 

A. If foreign - Will they exchange dollars for yuan? This puts pressure down on the dollar 

B. Will the buy short term bonds? This steepens the curve even more dramatically 

C. If American institutions sell long term bonds - what do they do with that cash? And with the additional cash now in the economy? (For scale the 1.9 T stimulus is almost 10% of the 2020 GDP and 4% of the entire US stock market.)

D. What will people do with all the extra cash?Put it in a bank? If so will banks lend more or no? Put it in a drawer - meaning they spend it later?

Copper is a solid indicator of rates / inflation and it‚Äôs been screaming that rates are not coming down anytime soon. $6T in balance sheet expansion (roughly 7 times the Federal asset purchase costs caused from the great financial crisis).

Don't have any positions in GME now though I wish everyone the best of luck. I've made my fair share of mistakes during the past few weeks also to be clear.

96,ATH," I'm not sure a static 80/20 (or 70/30 for that matter) really makes sense in the long run. You're most likely assuming you'd be able to pick a great moment for throwing those 20% into stocks and that's not neccessarily true. If you'd gone in on TSLA at 700 it'd be a bargain compared to the ATH of \~900, but it's not exactly a bargain knowing it's below 600 now.

Instead I think you should look more into entry and exit strategies, and adjust those strategies as you go. Manage your FOMO and will to take profits, even if it means missing out on maximizing profits.

When you enter a stock, set a stoploss that works for you. If it hits your stoploss, your loss will be minimal and you can then evaluate on your trade. Was your stop loss too aggresive, did you pick a bad time for entry etc.

If your entry works out and you start turning profit, change your stoploss to break even or small profit, e.g. as a trailing stop loss. When a stoploss triggers, start evaluating what to do next. Will you reenter the same stock later or enter a new stock?

This approach can take more time to manage, but it would give you the advantage of profiting from 100% of your cash and still have available cash in a scenario like the last three weeks, as a lot (if not all) of your stoplosses would trigger.

You also need to consider long term trades. If you're long on e.g. Apple, corrections suck but over a 3-5 year period it'll be a small blip.

126,TSLA," The problem is you can never know that the price will fall very soon. Even if you're very certain that it's overpriced and has to crash sooner or later, you can never know when exactly it will. And while you're waiting for that crash, it can just keep climbing and your short positions can bankrupt you. ""The market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent"" as the famous saying goes. So sometimes brokers are in a rush to get their money back, because there's a very real possibility there won't be any money left if they don't get it now. 

Real life example: TSLA. There have been many times I've been sure it was overpriced and due for a crash soon. And then it's doubled. And quadrupled. And then finally pulled back 25%, to a mere 3x the original 'overpriced' price. Lesson learned: don't short TSLA, the price may be irrational but it can stay that way long after you go bankrupt.

But back to the hedge/broker relationship. It's like.. your friend is a gambler. You loan him $90, he promises to pay you back $100. He gradually grows that into $400. He then loses $300 in 5 minutes. You tell him you'd like your $100 now, while he still has $100 to give you. He tells you he has a *really* good feeling about this next bet, he's due for a change in luck, just let him keep your money a little longer.

Oh, and you do have bills to pay. If you don't get that $100 you're not going to make rent tomorrow.

Do you (1) insist on collecting your money, pay your rent, and (unfortunately) bankrupt your friend leaving him no way pay his own rent; or (2) let him give it another go, possibly leading to a win where he can pay you back and still have some money for himself, or possibly leading to you both being broke and your landlord evicting you.

No matter how much you like your friend, no matter how much money you've made off him with these loans in the past, and no matter how much you trust his good feeling about this next bet, you gotta be really tempted to go with (1) so you can be 100% sure you still have a place to sleep tomorrow.

Of course there's also (3) your friend places his bet, draws terrible cards, and then you shut down the casino before the hand can finish. Honestly I never saw that one coming.",Avloren,5,/r/stocks/comments/lzrg0k/serious_question_if_during_a_short_squeeze_the/gq4qjbs/,0.105,0.748,0.146,0.9777

Lets say that stock peaks at your 100000 price. If no one buys in because that's too expensive, then that stock price should lower due to lack of demand. I'm positive you'll still be able to sell for a nice profit as the stock begins to normalize after the squeeze is over. Just don't wait too long to sell thinking it'll happen again. I think that's the main part you're forgetting. Not only that but anyone who shorted HAS to pay whatever price it is to cover those shorts. If the price gets to 100000 and they NEED *YOUR* STOCK and will pay whatever you want, ask for 200000.

But with how crazy GME was going, and the increased risk of failed to deliver, DTCC saw a potential risk of having to payout if the settlement didn't go through, so they upped the deposit on purchases. Robinhood couldn't afford the new deposit as a lot of people trade with money that isn't yet settled, so unavailable for the deposit.

Note this is just my limited understanding of these things and I am but a humble farmer. I could be wrong.

Let's say you're going to invest in a local ice cream shop, and you have 2 choices. One will sell very traditional, but amazing, ice cream. They have sold it in other cities and have done very well. 

The other choice is a brand new ice cream maker. They are doing stuff with ice cream that nobody has ever tried before. Different flavors, different textures, etc. 

Which do you feel more confident in? Which one is more likely to be successful with the use of your money? 

You have to think of your investments the same way. 

PLTR has a lot of potential, and a good product, but they have tons of barriers in front of them. It's not easy to make money selling software anyways, much less trying to sell something brand new.

240,BB," Totally agree. It was a great reply.

I try to read up more on the news of the company in question, and try to look at planned projects or communications over the coming months. Beware of meme stock optimism and overly sensational Twitter/Reddit posts or online comments. Instead try to understand what the company strategy is for the coming months or years. More mechanically, I also try to look at not just the stock price but volumes traded.

As many said here already, beware not to invest more than you can afford to lose. Personally I got hit hard with BB for instance.

261,AMZN," I think your portfolio looks solid from a risk-aversion perspective, especially if you have a 401K or other tax-avoidance retirement account that is invested in broad market indices/funds.  That said, the name that would probably give me the most heartburn is Costco because traditional brick/mortar retail faces certain existential risks, and there is risk as to how that industry will react or consolidate in the long term.  You are hedged against this risk, however, with PayPal, AMZN and Alibaba.  You may want to consider moving Costco into a broader sector consumer/retail ETF, and limiting the proportional holdings to 10% or so, and then distributing the remainder into a broad sector healthcare / pharma ETF or index to gain exposure in that space.  You also don‚Äôt have any industrial or agricultural manufacturing names‚Äîe.g., F, Deere, etc.‚Äîwhich is something to consider.  

I personally don‚Äôt believe in broad sector exposure for my actively managed brokerage account.  That‚Äôs what my 401K is for.  I don‚Äôt have the time to research specific stocks or industries too extensively, and so I have concentrated my personal investments into two stocks that I believe I understand pretty well.

265,AAPL," Echoing what others have said here. This is not diversified and will likely not out perform an index fund or certain mutual funds. Without understanding your financial plans or situation, I would highly recommend parking most of this money in a ‚Äúset it and forget it‚Äù fund. Whether that be an index fund or mutual fund is up to you. 

For example I have roughly 60K worth of savings currently. Some of it is in an emergency fund safe from the market. A big chunk of it is in a life cycle mutual fund that will grow and then protect it. A small portion is in a sector fund that I wanted exposure to (will be moving this soon). An even smaller portion is what I deem my ‚ÄúVegas money‚Äù. This is money in which I pick the stock and is very speculative and essentially gambling. My plan with this money is to, if I ‚Äúwin‚Äù, move 50% into my life cycle fund and re-invest the rest. This section of my money contains some value stocks such as AAPL, but is almost half gambles. 

How you invest your money is entirely up to you, but I strongly suggest thinking long and hard about your investment goals. Is it to have the possibility of making a lot of money quickly with the chance of loosing most of it? Sure, pick stocks. Or is it to reasonably grow the money for a future large purchase/retirement? 

Of note, in my overall investment strategy my retirement fund I don‚Äôt actively manage or even consider on a monthly basis. It is a separate pot of money that I put into with every pay check. But again, that is just how I manage my money.",coffee_TID,1,/r/stocks/comments/lzspkk/long_term_investor/gq44hht/,0.023,0.895,0.082,0.9331

360,AAPL," You can tell how long people have been watching the stock market by what they consider cheap. And the answer based on a lot of these responses is...not very long. NVDA is cheap because it's back to its price from...August? Before COVID it had peaked at ~50% of where it is now. AAPL is cheap for the same reason? I've held AAPL almost straight for 10 years now. (The first time I sold it since I bought it in 2011 was when the split happened in August. I've since bought and sold it back a few times since and currently own it.) This isn't ""cheap"" unless you think the COVID-fueled growth is somehow going to continue post-COVID. Don't get me wrong, they're going to grow, but it's not going to be as fast as it was this past year. COVID accelerated tech growth/penetration years ahead of where it would have been otherwise.

How much of the COVID growth is going to stick? How many people will now permanently WFH at least a few days a week? The answer is likely that a lot of the stronger tech stocks will never return to the pre-COVID levels (barring a catastrophic market collapse). But that doesn't mean they can't find a happier medium between their COVID prices and pre-COVID prices. Wouldn't surprise me to see the Nasdaq shed another 500-1000 points before recovering.

But what's actually a bargain? Who knows. I've been looking for stocks whose technicals are just returning to the lower bound of years-long pre-COVID channels. Largely ignoring the moving averages, since those are currently all COVID-market data. WMT is an example of what I'm talking about. Bought it Thursday. And even that's not raelly cheap, but at least relative to the last ~5 years or so, it's not bad. Costco is in a similar spot, but I'm not sure I want to own both. 

My idea of ""bargains"" are the companies that will return to ""normal"" based off of ""moderate"" COVID recovery. I think the idea that everyone's going to be hopping on planes and taking cruises immediately is a little overblown, and I wouldn't want to be hopping into stocks that are relying on a sudden boom. I wouldn't want to be chasing the stocks that are counting on everyone ""celebrating"" the end of COVID. But the stuff that will let people feel like life is at least somewhat back to normal? Like restaurants? That's where I'm bargain hunting.",FoundOmega,18,/r/stocks/comments/lzfvrv/buy_the_dip_but_which_stocks_are_actually_cheap/gq2aw27/,0.054,0.882,0.063,0.6039

And even that's not raelly cheap, but at least relative to the last ~5 years or so, it's not bad. Costco is in a similar spot, but I'm not sure I want to own both. 

My idea of ""bargains"" are the companies that will return to ""normal"" based off of ""moderate"" COVID recovery. I think the idea that everyone's going to be hopping on planes and taking cruises immediately is a little overblown, and I wouldn't want to be hopping into stocks that are relying on a sudden boom. I wouldn't want to be chasing the stocks that are counting on everyone ""celebrating"" the end of COVID. But the stuff that will let people feel like life is at least somewhat back to normal? Like restaurants? That's where I'm bargain hunting.",FoundOmega,18,/r/stocks/comments/lzfvrv/buy_the_dip_but_which_stocks_are_actually_cheap/gq2aw27/,0.054,0.882,0.063,0.6039
362,WMT," You can tell how long people have been watching the stock market by what they consider cheap. And the answer based on a lot of these responses is...not very long. NVDA is cheap because it's back to its price from...August? Before COVID it had peaked at ~50% of where it is now. AAPL is cheap for the same reason? I've held AAPL almost straight for 10 years now. (The first time I sold it since I bought it in 2011 was when the split happened in August. I've since bought and sold it back a few times since and currently own it.) This isn't ""cheap"" unless you think the COVID-fueled growth is somehow going to continue post-COVID. Don't get me wrong, they're going to grow, but it's not going to be as fast as it was this past year. COVID accelerated tech growth/penetration years ahead of where it would have been otherwise.

How much of the COVID growth is going to stick? How many people will now permanently WFH at least a few days a week? The answer is likely that a lot of the stronger tech stocks will never return to the pre-COVID levels (barring a catastrophic market collapse). But that doesn't mean they can't find a happier medium between their COVID prices and pre-COVID prices. Wouldn't surprise me to see the Nasdaq shed another 500-1000 points before recovering.

731,AAPL," The market is largely speculative/forward-looking. The drop in certain sectors is the result of that, even though individual companies are leveraged/affected to varying degrees.

You have traditional blue chip tech stocks that took a beating like MSFT and AAPL. These companies have completely manageable debt levels, but inflation speculation will still impact them because they‚Äôre bundled alongside riskier companies. Institutions thus offloaded and captured gains on them nonetheless and appear to have shifted into value stocks to reduce risk and realize the money they made in 2020.

Personally, and this is just my opinion as an economics layman, 2021 will see a greater emphasis on this issue and there will be a months-long (years-long?) shift toward reducing risk in their portfolios. This will mean less explosive growth in some sectors, which is why I think it‚Äôs a pretty healthy correction...and also why I‚Äôm not convinced that the correction will end any time soon. I think we have to see what happens this week to understand if Friday afternoon was a bull trap or a rebound. If institutions are done readjusting or at least winding down on it, we should see modest volatility in these sectors.

732,MSFT," The market is largely speculative/forward-looking. The drop in certain sectors is the result of that, even though individual companies are leveraged/affected to varying degrees.

You have traditional blue chip tech stocks that took a beating like MSFT and AAPL. These companies have completely manageable debt levels, but inflation speculation will still impact them because they‚Äôre bundled alongside riskier companies. Institutions thus offloaded and captured gains on them nonetheless and appear to have shifted into value stocks to reduce risk and realize the money they made in 2020.

Personally, and this is just my opinion as an economics layman, 2021 will see a greater emphasis on this issue and there will be a months-long (years-long?) shift toward reducing risk in their portfolios. This will mean less explosive growth in some sectors, which is why I think it‚Äôs a pretty healthy correction...and also why I‚Äôm not convinced that the correction will end any time soon. I think we have to see what happens this week to understand if Friday afternoon was a bull trap or a rebound. If institutions are done readjusting or at least winding down on it, we should see modest volatility in these sectors. If the NASDAQ bloodbath continues, it‚Äôs a sign that investors aren‚Äôt close to finished yet and may signify a flatter year for tech/EV growth overall.

 I saw some comments by Michael Burry and read an article about the Buffet indicator  showing that stocks were on average over valued. I wanted to rebalance my portfolio because of that reason and because February and March are statistically the worst months of the year for stocks in general.

In a correction stocks with high P/E usually go down hard. Sometimes 50 to 70 percent more than the index itself falls.

SHOP for example has a p/e of 291x earnings. TTD is at 102x earnings. TSLA is at 955 x earnings. The average p/e for most stocks is around 29x. Those kinds of valuations aren't sustainable in a market correction.

I went to 60 percent cash and kept 40 percent in a growth mutual fund ( FDGRX). I have held that mutual through just about every crash we have had in the last 10 years. It did 74 percent last year and averaged 20 percent over 10 years. 

What makes a stock go up is a mixture of a lot of things.  SHOP and NVDA had killer earnings last month but both stocks are way down from their highs. You have to have positive buying pressure with elevated volume to have a stock price increase.  Good fundamentals help but without people standing in line willing to pay a premium for a stock it will not move up over an extended period of time. A decrease on small volume means nothing but a decrease on heavy volume is meaningful. 

The biggest purchasers of stocks are Institutional  investors and Hedge funds. When the Whales move out of a sector to feed you got to move with them. 

Energy stocks, utilities, consumer staples, and communication services are all trading in the green in the current nervous environment. Tech stocks have clearly been in the red.

Finviz is a daily habit for me. You can do searches on which sectors have the biggest gains and highest volumes over the last week, month, 6 months, or year.  

I try and find stocks with good fundamentals,  a bullish candle stick pattern, and prices gapping up on high volume twice over a week or so in sectors that are  green over the last week and last month.

 I purchase and set a 7 percent stop loss below my entry.  I set an alert at 10 percent above and when it hits I move my stop loss up locking in a profit. If it runs long and deep I just keep adjusting my stop loss a little wider. The maximum I am going to ever lose is 15 percent from an all time high on a stock I have already made 100 percent or more on.

I would rather set a 7 percent stop loss and take my 93 percent left and invest it elsewhere than potentially waiting 6 months to infinity on a magic stock rise that might not happen. 

I actually like buying into positions that are increasing.  I did that with SHOP. It hit 100x return and I doubled down. It went to 800x and I just kept buying it along the way.

SHOP for example has a p/e of 291x earnings. TTD is at 102x earnings. TSLA is at 955 x earnings. The average p/e for most stocks is around 29x. Those kinds of valuations aren't sustainable in a market correction.

I went to 60 percent cash and kept 40 percent in a growth mutual fund ( FDGRX). I have held that mutual through just about every crash we have had in the last 10 years. It did 74 percent last year and averaged 20 percent over 10 years. 

What makes a stock go up is a mixture of a lot of things.  SHOP and NVDA had killer earnings last month but both stocks are way down from their highs. You have to have positive buying pressure with elevated volume to have a stock price increase.  Good fundamentals help but without people standing in line willing to pay a premium for a stock it will not move up over an extended period of time. A decrease on small volume means nothing but a decrease on heavy volume is meaningful. 

The biggest purchasers of stocks are Institutional  investors and Hedge funds. When the Whales move out of a sector to feed you got to move with them. 

Energy stocks, utilities, consumer staples, and communication services are all trading in the green in the current nervous environment. Tech stocks have clearly been in the red.

Finviz is a daily habit for me. You can do searches on which sectors have the biggest gains and highest volumes over the last week, month, 6 months, or year.  

I try and find stocks with good fundamentals,  a bullish candle stick pattern, and prices gapping up on high volume twice over a week or so in sectors that are  green over the last week and last month.

 I purchase and set a 7 percent stop loss below my entry.  I set an alert at 10 percent above and when it hits I move my stop loss up locking in a profit. If it runs long and deep I just keep adjusting my stop loss a little wider. The maximum I am going to ever lose is 15 percent from an all time high on a stock I have already made 100 percent or more on.

Here is my rebalanced (less tech) portfolio so far.

It's not as sexy as my tech portfolio but it's green over the last month which is pretty incredible.  I am adding positions each week.

I don't like dollar cost averaging down. It makes no sense to me to throw money at a company that is a falling knife. I have done it before and I usually lose my ass. I would rather set a 7 percent stop loss and take my 93 percent left and invest it elsewhere than potentially waiting 6 months to infinity on a magic stock rise that might not happen. 

I actually like buying into positions that are increasing.  I did that with SHOP. It hit 100x return and I doubled down. It went to 800x and I just kept buying it along the way. Why not throw money at a rising screamer than a loser. That's just my thoughts but I have proven it myself to be a way to make significant gains.

In a correction stocks with high P/E usually go down hard. Sometimes 50 to 70 percent more than the index itself falls.

SHOP for example has a p/e of 291x earnings. TTD is at 102x earnings. TSLA is at 955 x earnings. The average p/e for most stocks is around 29x. Those kinds of valuations aren't sustainable in a market correction.

I went to 60 percent cash and kept 40 percent in a growth mutual fund ( FDGRX). I have held that mutual through just about every crash we have had in the last 10 years. It did 74 percent last year and averaged 20 percent over 10 years. 

What makes a stock go up is a mixture of a lot of things.  SHOP and NVDA had killer earnings last month but both stocks are way down from their highs. You have to have positive buying pressure with elevated volume to have a stock price increase.  Good fundamentals help but without people standing in line willing to pay a premium for a stock it will not move up over an extended period of time. A decrease on small volume means nothing but a decrease on heavy volume is meaningful. 

The biggest purchasers of stocks are Institutional  investors and Hedge funds. When the Whales move out of a sector to feed you got to move with them. 

Energy stocks, utilities, consumer staples, and communication services are all trading in the green in the current nervous environment. Tech stocks have clearly been in the red.

820,WRE," Slave labor feeds the luxurious lifestyles of the upper crust of society, but adds risk to social rebellions and low morale. This feeds further into the idea that income inequality and wealth disparity played a large role in the decline.

The reliance on slave labor is moreso that they relied on conquering new lands to gain slaves, but when you lose your borders and your empire slips, it‚Äôs an added difficulty to reacquire cheap labor when they‚Äôre eager to turn against you in those areas.

You‚Äôre saying that China is a Republic, and we‚Äôre not a capitalist society?

I think you‚Äôre stretching quite a lot to match assumptions and create analogies that aren‚Äôt really there. China is an economic hybrid, part capitalist and part authoritarian. The state holds interest and direct influence over enterprise and commerce. The US is in some ways less capitalist, but we aren‚Äôt nearly the level of dictatorship that they are. There is in fact very little republican (lower case r) about China.

China may be more capitalistic, but they‚Äôre also more authoritarian, which is really the heart of my point: these societies that you‚Äôre talking about, Ancient Rome, China, the US...they‚Äôre all different.

DOC has been rangebound for years both in its share price and its dividend yield. In that aspect it's a great holding for those deep in retirement that are looking for a stable, high-yielding bond alternative. Medical office buildings (MOBs) are DOC's speciality, and they are highly stable regardless of the economic environment - people will always need to go to the doctor regardless of the unemployment or inflation rate, and doctors will need spaces in which to see those patients. It will never explode in demand, though. If you're a younger, growth-oriented investor, then it may be better to focus on alternatives that are more dividend growth-oriented.

I held because it added a stable, bond alternative component to my portfolio but have since exited for other REITs that offered a more dynamism.

836,GME," take this with a grain of salt.

I‚Äôve been heavily into whats going on with gamestop, since it first squeezed end of January from $40-$480.

Since then there has been significant data indicating heavily shorted stock, naked calls/puts, shorting through etfs, and much more.

A hypothesis running at this moment, is that certain hedgefunds are liquiding some of their positions in other stocks, as seen this week, to continually fuel their fight against the squeeze thats due for gamestop. GME gained 33% this week, while many stocks plumented.

An inverse relationship with GME is SPY. Compare the charts and you can see a correlation.

Over the last few weeks I am down 1% overall.   Two weeks ago I was down 2%.  Last Friday it had improved to 1%.

What I am seeing tells me is the reports that this is a rotation out of growth and into value stocks and cyclicals look to be true.  Or at least the correction has not spread out of tech yet.  Maybe that will happen tomorrow, but I don't see what has happened over the last month or so as bearish overall.  I am really interested to see the market's response to the stimulus.

8. Still noone trust them thus they are heavily undervalued compared to their peers

I think halo is the Microsoft of the cannabis industrie. They know what they are doing. They focus on quality and solid growth and they are setting up things to scale big.

908,AMZN," >I looked at my positions on Fidelity it shows Gamestop as a wash sale and the average cost basis is now $164 ($1,640 total) a share.

You didn't sell any of it in 2020 so you won't have any profits or losses to report when you file your taxes this year for the 2020 tax year so you don't have to worry about anything right now.  You might want to worry about it sometime this year, after reading my last paragraph.

Your losses are added to the cost basis, so you got in at 133 but it shows a cost basis of 164 *and this is a good thing*.  You're taxed on the sell price minus the cost basis of all of your transactions for the year.  You add up all the gains, subtract all the losses, and you wind up with one single positive or negative number (actually 2 numbers, long term and short term, but for the sake of simplicity I'm gonna assume your gains are all predominantly short term).  When you finally sell and don't trigger yet another wash sale, lets say at 164, your proceeds will be 164 and your cost basis will be 164, so 164-164 = 0.  0 dollars in taxable gains.  So you do get to reap the benefits of your prior losses in a wash sale.  You bought back in at 133 but they aren't going to tax you for 164-133, they're letting you use your wash sale losses to offset the gains, so 164-164 instead.  Awesome.

The big evil scary thing to pay attention to is carrying wash sales into the next year.  Imagine if you lost a million on Gamestop, but bought back in, triggered a wash sale, and the million in losses is added to your cost basis.  Then, in August, you do a trade on AMZN and make a million dollars.  You pretty much broke even on those 2 trades.  But you don't sell Gamestop, and hold it into the year 2022.  You do your taxes and you wind up with 1 million dollars in taxable short term capital gains, and you could have zeroed that out in 2021 by selling Gamestop, but that time has come and gone, IRS wants their share of that million.  You finally sell Gamestop in 2022 but those losses will be subtracted from any gains for the year 2022 and can't be retroactively subtracted from your 2021 and you file bankruptcy because you have hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt to the IRS.

911,AMZN," Look at some Value Investment or Value Evaluation videos on YouTube about Amazon.
I like the one that Cameron Stewart made relatively recently.

You'll find that expected return for AMZN at 3K is about 12% year-over-year for 10years if they maintain an aggressive growth coming years.

912,AMZN," That makes sense intuitively, but would those picks be appropriate for newer investors with limited funds? Like I placed in another comment, if a person had $2 million in a portfolio, dropping $100K today on AMZN might be a great bet. But what about many investors that might have $10K starting? 2 shares of AMZN and that is pretty much their only holding.

Maybe the answer is not trading at all. I recently heard a Tim Ferriss podcast recalling a question he asked to Warren Buffett about what an investor with less than $500K should invest in. His basic answer was nothing, they should continue to work more until they acquire enough wealth to actually capitalize on the stock market.",A_Postal_Worker,1,/r/stocks/comments/lzufhh/evaluating_companies_and_finding_troughs/gq449i5/,0.018,0.822,0.16,0.9653
913,AMZN," Thanks for the link and terminology to explore more.

Ultimately I wasn't thinking it was a bad investment so to speak. Just seems many of the MF picks have already appreciated 10x or even 100x by now. Buying AMZN stock today isn't a terrible idea, but for many investors they can't realistically capitalize on that without dropping $100K to pickup 30 shares.

I would rather gamble buying newer companies that might be the ""Next Amazon/Netflix"" and getting in at the bottom taking more of a risk that they will not. 

Unfortunately I just get the impression many MF picks have already either hit near the peak or are very close, but investors aren't going to see earth shattering returns on them. If somebody already had a multi million dollar portfolio, buying high and selling slightly higher might make more sense. For beginners and small portfolios, seems like playing the troughs is the best option.",A_Postal_Worker,1,/r/stocks/comments/lzufhh/evaluating_companies_and_finding_troughs/gq437rj/,0.032,0.819,0.149,0.9553
914,ALL," Looks like you have to adjust expectations, market returns are typically \~7-10% over a portfolio over the long long term. So no matter how much Amazon you buy, if you expect to get 12% at an acceptable risk, that is above market and worth doing unless you find a higher return at equal or lower risk.

It seems you want to grow your money much faster than what you can safely expect from the market as a whole.

That might work in the short term, if you take high risks. But in the long run you are almost certain to lose money and actually underperform.

You can buy 1000 small companies today that ALL go bust in the next 30 years. The next Amazon or Apple might not even exist yet, or maybe they are the current  Amazon and Apple?

Please set realistic expectations, getting a 10% return year over year is already challenging enough.",AmazingSibylle,1,/r/stocks/comments/lzufhh/evaluating_companies_and_finding_troughs/gq4wjea/,0.079,0.783,0.138,0.7146
915,RKT," Well I for sure feel this. I have 8 shares of Tesla i picked up around $450 (post split). I thought about selling at circa 800 but didn‚Äôt simply for the reason that a $2500 gain isn‚Äôt life changing money versus leaving it in and potentially going higher.

Same for rocket. Doubling your money to a whopping $400 vs risking leaving it for higher gains. It‚Äôs hard to pull profits and still have any meaningful growth availability left. 

Much easier to invest 10k, double it, and pull $10k to zero out and leave another $10k to ride. 

But the percentages are the same and the same theories and practices would make sense to follow. But for me it was just easier to let my $200 in RKT ride for the long run and not try to mess with capitalizing short large % (but small #) gains vs leaving it for 5+ years instead. 

But it‚Äôs definitely invested because I cannot put away enough cash to ever retire. I mean, if you expect to work 40 years and then retire for 30, you have to put away almost an entire year‚Äôs worth of expenses ($25k-80k/yr depending on what lifestyle you hope to have in the future) every single year you work. (Inflation should make 40 yrs of Savings about equivalent to 30 yrs of retirement.) And that isn‚Äôt even accounting for added expenses like nursing home care that make cost of living go up in your later years. So, no pretty much no average person can cash flow their retirement.",InevitableRhubarb232,1,/r/stocks/comments/lzufhh/evaluating_companies_and_finding_troughs/gq4q407/,0.042,0.763,0.195,0.993

This seems pretty diverse and expands their scope of products far beyond EV. I am excited about the electrical potential for these battery peaker power plants and feel like it could be the future, but I‚Äôm still too shy to buy into Tesla stocks with all the ‚Äúovervalued ‚Äú talk.
