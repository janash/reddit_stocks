To add some further perspective, today Adobe (which in the graph has revenue of $13b v $23b for Airpods) has a Market Cap of around $300 billion.

13,IMO," I've generally hung onto mine for about 2+ years before moving on to something newer and I'm one of the slower ones in that respect. I think the main issue is battery replacement. Not unique to Apple, but because of the form factor and warranty you really need to take it in for a simple battery replacement. Apple was the first one to really make that a normal thing, now many of the other manufacturers follow suit. Apple otherwise followed the trends of 00's cell phones and car manufacturers and released new models yearly. They're mass-produced mini computers that get knocked around like crazy, so its understandable they only last a few years at most.

IMO if they wanted to get rid of the general perception of planned obsolescence  they could add one freebie battery replacement to their standard warranty (not AppleCare). But I do think they have run the numbers on this and generally know that people who care enough would buy AppleCare anyway.",TheGRS,3,/r/investing/comments/osx7or/apple_demolishes_earnings_expectations_but_stock/h6u1vaf/,0.018,0.904,0.078,0.8807

38,ATH," I've paid attention to the last several earnings reports from MS. Each time they beat earnings expectations, and every time the stock tanks after hours (this time it also rebounded in after hours, but other times it takes days or weeks).

&#x200B;

But, every time it tanks and then rebounds to a new ATH shortly after. Then MS beats expectations again and the cycle continues.

&#x200B;

Is the idea that, leading up to earnings, people are hoping that MS will beat expectations by a massive margin, and that is inflating the stock price higher than it really should be? Then they fall short of those exaggerated expectations, and a correction happens?

&#x200B;

But I don't get how this can happen so many times in a row. MS is up over 400% in 5 years. Every earnings report the stock dips, and within a month or two it has recovered that value and continues to grow. How many times in a row can people sell at -10% then see it increase by 20% within a couple months?

&#x200B;

This last one was the shortest lived dip I've seen recently, followed by an after hours spike to an ATH, so maybe people are catching on and a bigger crowd was waiting to buy the after-earnings dip. But now, during normal hours, and stock is just slowly losing value over the course of the day.

Perfect situation with investing.     There is just nothing like being the gate keeper for information to over 90% of the population.     Endless opportunities to monetize.    

https://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share

Plus Google market share continues to increase.    Their chief competitor, Microsoft, lost over 15% of the market share in the last year with ALL going to Google.

But if that is not enough.  Google then owns the second most popular web site on the planet only behind Google search with YouTube.

YouTube is the asset where Google has the most runway.  It will pass Netflix this year to become the biggest streaming service but also growing crazy fast without any end in site.

YouTube was created in 2006 and over the last 15 years there has been millions and millions of hours or video uploaded and that will never happen with any other service.  Nobody would ever go back and over the last 15 years and re upload all that content to a new service.

It means there is no competitor to YouTube and Google been giving away to run up the users.  Now they have well over 2 billion DAU and moved well ahead of FB it is time to milk it.   There is so much more money for Google to make with YouTube.

BTW, the other reason it would be next to impossible to compete against is the infrastructure cost.  Google has already in place and doing themselves so no margins to pay to a CDN or cloud provider.   It makes it very hard for a competitor.   The DAU is also how Google has been able to go from 3.5 billion Short views a day 3 quarters ago.  Then 6.5 billion 2 quarters ago.  Now over 15 billion last quarter.

But if that is not enough.  Google then owns the second most popular web site on the planet only behind Google search with YouTube.

YouTube is the asset where Google has the most runway.  It will pass Netflix this year to become the biggest streaming service but also growing crazy fast without any end in site.

YouTube was created in 2006 and over the last 15 years there has been millions and millions of hours or video uploaded and that will never happen with any other service.  Nobody would ever go back and over the last 15 years and re upload all that content to a new service.

It means there is no competitor to YouTube and Google been giving away to run up the users.  Now they have well over 2 billion DAU and moved well ahead of FB it is time to milk it.   There is so much more money for Google to make with YouTube.

BTW, the other reason it would be next to impossible to compete against is the infrastructure cost.  Google has already in place and doing themselves so no margins to pay to a CDN or cloud provider.   It makes it very hard for a competitor.   The DAU is also how Google has been able to go from 3.5 billion Short views a day 3 quarters ago.  Then 6.5 billion 2 quarters ago.  Now over 15 billion last quarter.  So the growth acceleration rate is also increasing!!",bartturner,16,/r/investing/comments/osx9ue/alphabet_earnings_google_advertising_revenue/h6tdxw4/,0.06,0.832,0.108,0.9498
50,HUGE," I work in paid ad management. This doesn’t surprise me at all. 

Google Ads used to be completely in our control, we controlled the keywords we target, the bids we’re willing to pay per click, how much budget we want to spend, etc etc. Over the last two years and especially the last year Google has made a HUGE push into “smart” bidding strategies and machine learning capabilities. We have Google account reps that are really just pushy salesmen that coerce you into “trying” out these strategies. Sometimes they do work but mostly they increase your cost and dilute your performance. As a veteran in the space I know better but as a noobie how would you? 

Most of the “smart” strategies inner workings are hidden, can’t see very important performance metrics you used to be able to. Kind of in the dark with how your ad spend is being spent. A lot of “trust the machine learning capabilities” going on.

Because I recognize that there's this whole entity, GOOG, a complex company which has some value but which we will not try to define. But there's this other part, the cash which GOOG holds, which we can apply our marginal thinking on.

That's why we can reason about what happens when the cash on hand fluctuates, without having to think about how to value the company as a whole. We are thinking on the margins.

96,AMD," Sorry but AMD doesn't have a transistor advantage.

Foundries have different specifications for how their chip geometry is measured. Ultimately performance bench marks is all that matters.

AMD may be able to translate hype into sales, but that's all it is. Intel is still a superior chip because their internal geometry is impeccable, and it is seen in their performance.

[https://www.pcgamer.com/chipmaking-process-node-naming-lmc-paper/](https://www.pcgamer.com/chipmaking-process-node-naming-lmc-paper/)

I also can't emphasize enough that the Federal Government will probably terminate its use of anything built by TSMC which is AMD's primary supply.

Therefore AMD is at **SIGNIFICANT RISK** to geopolitics.

They look good now but could be demolished in a few months.

99,AMD," This makes no sense. AMD has proven their CPUs are more powerful than Intel. It doesn't matter if Intel's 10nm may be more dense than a future 5nm or whatever, what matters is performance. AMD has that ahead of Intel. Furthermore, AMD is also putting more and more cores into their Processors so Intel can talk all they want about density, but until it translates to actual computing power, it doesn't matter.

As for geopolitical risks... You're SEVERELY overblowing the risk. The West has a strong vested interest in defending Taiwan, and even if China were to somehow capture Taiwan, TSMC would be heavily subsidized in moving to the US.

2025 goal of 2x'ing the active accounts and 3x'ing the TPV (among other goals) which is discussed in the investor day presentation from Feb.

Nothing against Sofi, I don't have an opinion either way. I do think though that small in fintech doesn't necessarily mean long runway of growth - larger companies with more resources and a far larger base of users can potentially eat the lunch of smaller companies and/or companies that offer more specific services.  In an increasingly crowded fintech space, what advantage does a company have over another? What is the moat?

Look at things like AFRM, which was a ""hot"" buy now pay later stock and then PYPL went into buy now pay later and now Apple is talking about it. A company devoted to a specific niche of fintech can become a mere service of a larger player who can likely compete on price. That's not to say that AFRM is going away or something like that, just that it's probably going to be difficult in a crowded market where something like buy now pay later can be hot but if it's hot there's really not that much keeping someone else from doing it too and the service becoming a commodity. With something like PYPL buy now/pay later is one aspect of a diversified company. With something like AFRM, that's the whole business.

Additionally, with all the fintechs that are focused more heavily on loans, what does that loan book look like, do I feel confident in their ability to navigate a downturn?

2025 goal of 2x'ing the active accounts and 3x'ing the TPV (among other goals) which is discussed in the investor day presentation from Feb.

Nothing against Sofi, I don't have an opinion either way. I do think though that small in fintech doesn't necessarily mean long runway of growth - larger companies with more resources and a far larger base of users can potentially eat the lunch of smaller companies and/or companies that offer more specific services.  In an increasingly crowded fintech space, what advantage does a company have over another? What is the moat?

Look at things like AFRM, which was a ""hot"" buy now pay later stock and then PYPL went into buy now pay later and now Apple is talking about it. A company devoted to a specific niche of fintech can become a mere service of a larger player who can likely compete on price. That's not to say that AFRM is going away or something like that, just that it's probably going to be difficult in a crowded market where something like buy now pay later can be hot but if it's hot there's really not that much keeping someone else from doing it too and the service becoming a commodity. With something like PYPL buy now/pay later is one aspect of a diversified company. With something like AFRM, that's the whole business.

Additionally, with all the fintechs that are focused more heavily on loans, what does that loan book look like, do I feel confident in their ability to navigate a downturn?

161,ALL," Yes you can take out all your contributions tax free and up to $10,000 in earnings (lifetime limit) from your IRA to buy a home. You'd save a little from a capital gains tax perspective. For instance, if you invested $6000 at the start of 2020 in a Roth IRA S&P 500 index fund and it gained 6% per year for 5 years, you'd have about $8030. In the IRA you could take out the full $6000 of contributions and because your investment earnings are less than $10,000 (assume this is a first time using this exemption) you can take out all of your investment returns. 

Now let's say you used after tax dollars and invested that same $6000 in a taxable S&P 500 index fund. If you did that, you'd end with the same $8030 after 5 years AND YOU CAN USE ALL THAT MONEY ON YOUR HOME. However, you will have to pay 15% capital gains tax on the $2030 investment returns for a total of about $305 when filing taxes for the tax year you made the withdrawal. 

In this scenario, yes you save $305 in taxes with the IRA, but what you gain in tax savings, you loose flexibility. In the event that your home buying plans changes or the rules and legislation for that tax free withdrawal change, the IRA won't be near as flexible.

163,IMO," In a lot of retirement accounts that are in only 3 funds, I don't think you need to reallocate more than annually, but it is always up to you.  If you want to do it more often, it is your call.

As to aggressive, if your age is 60+ then that is an aggressive portfolio,  otherwise maybe not.  that is a pretty high allocation of bonds IMO if you are young.  Personally if you are over 30 years to retirement draw down, an aggressive portfolio would be 0% bonds. Given that the bond market also has massive headwinds from interest rate risk, I think bonds have never been more likely to drag on a portfolio, probably for a decade.  that's an opinion, take it for what it is worth.

As to %s, the US stock market is right now in the ballpark of 67% of global stock market cap.  So what you are showing here is a slight overweight of world at 37.5% of your stock investment.  this bull market, which is in its final third, is going to continue to be led by US.  I would think you would be better off at 70+% US, but this is why people make their own allocation decisions :).  as for other overweights to consider, because of where we are in this bull, consider overweight large cap, consumer discretionary, tech and health care... this will lead you to S&P or NASDAQ, and when market conditions change, you rebalance away from that.
