After VIX peaks, I see that it is usually it is a good time to buy. You would have wished to buy several different stocks and TQQQ too back in mid May, for example.

[https://imgur.com/a/lRYX1Q9](https://imgur.com/a/lRYX1Q9)

&#x200B;

(please don't mind the crappy fonts. The black line is SMA200) Now it seems like we are here again and yesterday (July 19th) we saw a few shy green candles. However, I'm not entirely convinced that's the top yet (or the bottom of the dip): looking better at it and at the indicators and oscillators, the situations reminds me May 3-4th.

Let's look at TQQQ:

* As in early May, the Bollinger Bands (yellow area. The yellow line is SMA20) are closing the end of the current ""sausage"", which usually marks a trend change. In May it was more apparent, because the price was consolidating. This time too is dropping from the top of the band, but it is also dropping after it reached the top of Keltner (cyan area), as in Feb 16th and Jan 25th.
* As early May (and Feb), the ""fast"" MACD is falling from the peak.
* Also as in early May, ADX is crossing and signaling the possible upcoming of the begin of a bearish phase (when -DI, that red line, is moving at the top and it remains above the others), unless it bounces up now.
* Chande pointing downward (honestly I use this one just for short trades and if other data and patterns confirm)
* Williams pointing strongly downward. It doesn't look like at the bottom yet, although sometimes it bounces back at this point (see the end of Jan, in this graph, for example).
* There is a bunch of negativity lately and some bad news; that was happening in the first weeks of May too.

[https://imgur.com/L90UR4g](https://imgur.com/L90UR4g)


Violet vertical lines compare this July 19th with May 13th situations (I added Feb and Jan too as a references). Red vertical lines the tops. Green vertical lines more or less the actual bottoms.

I think at best, it could be a dip as in the last week of January, which would be pretty good, if it's confirmed today.

In sum, although there is some positive sign, if I try to buy now, I'd enter cautiously and keep the stop loss ready or I'd averaging-down the time I see the next possible bottom. Else, I'd wait a few days, especially if VIX goes up again and TQQQ slips further down and it begins to ride the bottom of the Bollinger Band.Note, these graphs is the reason I didn't touch TQQQ a few days ago, when someone was considering TQQQ as a faster alternative to SPY (which doesn't look a bad idea to me), and by looking at the graphs it was at the top and I though to wait for an imminent dip.

52,TSP," I’m stuck and I need help. I’m 41, just retired from the military in May and have $92k in my Roth TSP L2040 fund. My wife is 40, still in the military and will retire in 3 years. She barely has anything in her TSP (<$1k) and I just had her do a 60/20/20 C/S/I in Traditional TSP @15% of her base pay.
Well, I just got a job that pays $102k/yr and has a 6% match for their 401k so I put 6% in the traditional 2040 fund. Now I’m looking ahead and realizing we can both open an IRA, max out her TSP, both IRAs and my 401k and possibly open a brokerage account as well. I’m definitely liking the boglehead approach but I’m stuck trying to decide if, now that we’re in the 22% tax bracket, we should go Roth or traditional or a mixture. Also, should we just do lifecycle funds for all tax advantaged accounts and VT in the brokerage? Should we do a mix of 1, 2 and 3 fund across the different accounts? Maybe put BND in one IRA and VT in the other?

With this formula it may seem that higher the Beta (Volatility of stock) leads to higher return but in practice low volatility portfolio returned better results. It was a really big punch in efficient market hypothesis but later the formula were adjusted to r = b(rm-rf) + SMB + HML + RMW + CMA, where smb - small minus big (size premium), hml - high minus low (Book To Market or Value premium), rmw - robust minus weak (profitability premium), cma - conservative minus aggressiv (investment premium). This new formula explained that low volatility stocks were exposed to different premiums usually profitability and investment factors.
