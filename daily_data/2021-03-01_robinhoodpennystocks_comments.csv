7,CTXR," Great DD! Thank you again for your hard work this week

I had a some points about companies, $CTXR with Mino-Lok, and $CRMD with Defencath. 

To start is not saying that $CRMD’s product will not help people, which it very well could, and truthfully if you have cancer or any sort of ailment that requires you to have a catheter put in, and on top of that you now have to worry about a possible infection with a 25% death rate. These people have had it rough and hopefully any product comes out sooner then later to help those who need it. 

That being said,

So I’m still new at this but after reading $CRMD, and $CTXR’s websites I noticed a difference in wording about each companies main product to treat CRBSIs. 

$CRMD is marketed as an antibacterial and anti-fungal while $CTXR is an antibiotic. After some research it seems like antibiotics are better in a medical sense. antibacterial and anti-fungal can both be bought over the counter typically while antibiotics are typically prescribed by a doctor. 

Another note is that $CRMD doesn’t provide data on the results of their phase 3 trials, while $CTXR provides data that their product was 100% effective. 

On $CRMDs website it mentions how they began working with the FDA in 2015 they began working with the FDA more closely about Defencath but not much more information I can find. 

I’m biased as I own a position in CTXR, but I’ve done extensive research and I’m genuinely confident in the company and my positions, even with the pending FDA approval.",GucciRobboo,3,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/lusvbi/dd_on_the_top_mentioned_stocks_in_the_last_48/gpal1wt/,0.05,0.826,0.123,0.9703

10,CTXR," $CRMD

Does this not worry anyone else? It's had a pretty positive run up the last couple months and with a press release tomorrow on their product it could hurt CTXR.

Double check their presentation for me pls, but I am a little sweaty.

LOCK-IT-100 trial of Defencath demonstrated 71% reduction in the risk of occurrence of Catheter related blood stream infection in 795 hemodialysis subjects

I mean, yeah two different products for two different purposes, but if a reduction in those infections would surely impact what occurs down stream.

58,ASRT," i am a newbie at options too. I mainly stick to buying calls. I dont trust myself with puts (selling or buying) because of the infinite risk. i know we can compensate with covered puts and other spreads, but my account is smaller to play them out and make my returns significant and take that risk.

Here is what i do and mostly the basic 101:

1. I dont do weekly calls unless its very interesting (like ASRT mar 19 call)
2. I dont buy calls that have premium more than 10-15% of the price unless i buy long calls (3-4 months advance).
3. i stick to smaller number of calls (5-10)
4. try to stay away from meme stock options  due to large volatility(i have 400 shares in amc -no options)
5. i sometimes look at delta and theta but most of the time, the 10-15% premium actually takes care of this
6. i buy calls that i think will hit the money. For example i dont buy a $5 asrt call in. the next 3 months even-though they are cheap, since i dont trust it rising 500% in the next 3 months. So do your work before jumping in.

Finally, understand that this is not financial advice and also play with money that you can lose. This is especially important with options because, unlike buying shares, you are not buying anything. you are just betting on the odds. i have around 60% success with 20-30% gains on options. Not that great i guess but thats just me.

Watch few videos and play around with a couple of safe bets if interested. Again not a financial advice. Am just a random guy with less experience than you i presume. Have fun and dont stress

&#x200B;

Edit: One thing i forgot is, i almost never exercise my option (so  basically dont wait till the exercise date). If it grows and if am happy with my profits, i sell the option to close and take my profit. Example. I had 05/21 $7.5 SOS call when the stock was around $4. It went all the way to 15 i believe with a short burst. I sold at $12 took the profits instead of waiting since it still had time. This is partly because i dont have enough funds to exercise my options and second, i dont have emotional connection to that stock. Its just bitcoin play.

120,CEO," Hello all. I am a degenerate and an introvert. I do not work well with others but I am very detail oriented which makes me a great asset for you when it comes to DD for stocks. Here is a DD for your next money bag.

Company: Corvus Pharmaceuticals (CRVS)

Analysis

1. The company recently completed an offering at the price of 3.5$ per share where insiders purchase a large stake. This should be your support at 3.50. Currently the price is 3.48 so if you get in here , you are getting the same price as the insiders.
2. The CEO, Richard Miller, previous owned Pharmacyclics which he sold for 260$ a share. This means that CRVS is in good hands and it should be going up coupled with the insider purchase.
3. The stock has been at support for awhile. The last time this stock traded in high volume was in October, 2020 with 40,000,000 trading volume. Before this, it was traded high volume summer of 2019 with 90,000,000 trading volume. So it has been awhile since the stock trade in high volume. Based on this information couple with insider purchase, I predict a high volume trading day is around the corner. 
4. Multiple analysts predict the price for this stock this year at 15$ high, 9$ medium, 4$ low. So you are getting the bottom here at this current price. Plus it’s low risk buying at this price.
5. The float of this stock is still low which means it can jump high fast so we want to prepare to capture that jump. 
6. The pipeline for this company is extensive. But let’s focus on the hot one. The covid 19 treatment drug they are working on. It’s currently in phase 3 enrolling 1000 patients in a randomized clinical studies. We should get preliminary results soon then I believe a licensing deal with a big pharma to produce this drug will happen. We can easily see a huge jump to 15$ when the licensing deal is announced. Also, based preclinical and clinical data, management believes that this treatment is safe and effective for covid 19 patients. So this is a good sign and which also explains why the confidence the management has for this company with their stock purchase
7. Please also review all the cited resources I provide here for you to confirm.

275,ASRT," Ok I but what catalysts do they have coming up that will cause it’s price to go up?

The entire market had been speculated too high. Basically taking prices to their catalyst levels WAY before the actual catalyst is able to take place. So once the catalysts take place we have a situation where the stock should rise but since it’s been pumped up too much before hand the stock instead stagnates cause investor trust issues and therefore the stock dropping.

ASRT is a prime example. It’s was pumped to make compliance but in doing so once it hit compliance its price was already pumped and had nowhere else to go but back down. This is the problem when people drive a stock price up to force it to hit compliance thinking once it’s compliant it’ll go up even more. Instead it’s already at its “compliance hype” inflation point and without any other LEGITIMATE catalysts has nowhere to go buy down",J-Icky420,-10,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/lve35n/someone_give_me_reasons_to_hold_asrt_thinking_it/gpbigoz/,0.021,0.917,0.062,0.7783

284,TXMD," Edited to add my position in the stock for disclosure.

Basically. Options contracts are 100 shares each. So if you have 6000 shares and select a $2 strike and you can sell 60 contracts for the April expery date, you'll collect a premium of .2/share for each contract.  Assuming you can contracts on all your shares at this strike point and expiration date and your cost basis is currently $2.25, you'd drop your cost basis down to $2.05. So if the price rises to past $2 by April 16th and your shares are called away you'd lose $0.05 per share.  If the price hasn't risen to $2 per share by then the contracts expire worthless and you could repeat to further lower your cost basis.

This isn't entirely without risk, if the floor falls out on the stock you can't sell your shares until you close your contracts by either buying them back (hopefully for less than the premium you initially received) or by letting them expire.

As full disclosure I still learning ins and outs of options trading and I have 1000 shares of TXMD , bought in between 1.9 and 2.25 a share but have averaged down to 1.75 by selling covered calls between $2 to $3 strike points.  I'm still bullish on the stock for long term but receiving premiums in the short term helps ease the pain of seeing the unrealized losses.",aRampagingTroodon,1,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/lvdzri/thoughts_on_txmd_havent_seen_much_talk_about_it/gpc9817/,0.082,0.834,0.084,-0.1416

That's only if you want or need it back quickly though.

Playing it safer and selling either 1.5-2 calls can generate \~10$ a week. So you would need 10 successful wheels at that price range to break even.

All of this is just a way to say it's a fun stock to wheel, if you want another stock to wheel. I would not expect this stock to be great for long holdings.
