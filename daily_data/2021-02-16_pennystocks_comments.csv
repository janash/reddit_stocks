0,BNGO," This is why I will always be happy taking profits early. I look at BNGO right now and think ""Damn I could have held that since it was $1"" but how often do stocks actually go that high and continue going that high? With reference to penny stocks I mean.

Plus holding a stock after a big run just destroys you mentally when you are fearing a major drop off.

Unless you firmly believe the company will do amazing long term... just take the profits when you are satisfied because, chances are, a ton of people are thinking the same thing.",Defiant_Mercy,3,/r/pennystocks/comments/ll19lm/often_penny_stocks_go_so_high_and_drop_fast_here/gnnrh35/,0.124,0.711,0.165,0.5859

9,ALL," It’s helpful to think of it like this:

A stock can go 999999999999999% up but a single 100% down will take ALL that gains away. 

This means, while small gains like 1-10% are basically equal to 1-10% loss, a massive loss like 90% needs 900% or more gain to equalize. Since this is exponential, a 99% loss would need like 100,000% gain and so on. Given that 100% loss means you technically need infinite% growth to match (which is impossible starting at 0, which is 100% loss).",JoeWelburg,2,/r/pennystocks/comments/ll19lm/often_penny_stocks_go_so_high_and_drop_fast_here/gnnezby/,0.104,0.606,0.29,0.9693

25,DD," I mean I understand that, but that is only true when you only use the 40 dollar you got out of it. If you start again with 100 then it's only a 40% gain to get your loss out of it. 

But that's still besides the point. If you invest into a stock with some risk/reward analysis (however much or little DD you do) your loss or gain of the next trade you make, in my opinion, is independent of the previous one. This graph simply outlines our emotional response to investing with a bias towards personal history.

69,DD," Don´t get too excited. Only 25-35% of phase 3 trials proceed to phase 4, also often those fail which were promising before. Phase 3 trials easily take 2-4 years, sometimes longer. The drug can still fail in phase 4 when there are even rare side effects. We know those from drug users, this could be a problem. Phase 4 can still take several years until there is enough trust and data. The big money will be spent when phase 4 is already a few years happening.

Also don´t forget: This is highly specialized treatment, not just taking pills. Until this lifts off and enough people are trained to perform this safely another few years are down the road. We have good psychotherapeutical methods from the late 90s, which took around 20 years to become standards. Never seen a method becoming a standard in under 10 years.

Also: MDMA is a very cheap drug, a dose can be easily produced for under 1$. You don´t need many doses for treatment. This would be still a multimillion dollar business but surely not billions. Keep that in mind when you do your DD.

75,CBD," 1. HITIF is a grouping of companies. Some of their stores are retail stores that sell THC containing products (flower, edibles, consumables in some fashion), as well as products to allow users to consume those goods (smoking vessels). They also deal with this in retail as is. They also have a CBD specific business venture as well. 
2. Will weed be sold in CBD shops? That would depend on the legalization and regulation of how Cannabis selling stores can be setup. THC and CBD are different feelings when ingested, but there is still overlap in the market for users. People who use THC still will use CBD and vice versa. When I was in Oregon which is a legal state, Cannabis selling shops still sold pure CBD products. 
3. I personally do not think that CBD products would go down, if anything there may be an increase in them based on the fact there will be more stores, and possibly more of a focus in creating and legitimatizing cannabis as an industry. Anecdotal evidence I have heard from said Cannabis shop is that non-hemp derived CBD is better and a bit more potent in cases. I believe the majority of CBD is currently hemp derived in the states, so that would change and be improved. 

This is not financial advice, and I am by NO means a cannabis expert, just some points to consider.",Fuck_Mobile,4,/r/pennystocks/comments/ll3pq2/hitif_catalyst/gnnrrky/,0.016,0.899,0.084,0.9209

The current situation - DD

Dvax currently has an approved hepatitis-B vaccine on the market and their revenue has been growing their revenue exponentially. The EU will vote and likely approve the vaccine as well based on final feedback to the EU commission

Dynavax share prices blew up recently as they announced a flurry of partnerships with Covid vaccine partners who want to use their adjuvant, they even beat out GSK to become partners with Clover. 


https://www.thepharmaletter.com/article/clover-advances-with-dynavax-on-covid-19-vaccine-and-drops-gsk-partnership 

Their current partners:
Valneva- covid
Clover- covid
Medigen- covid
Biological E. Limited - covid
Serum institute of India -covid and Tdap
Mount Sinai - Flu

CEPI has already given them $99M so they are well funded. If even one of these vaccines make it to market, this stock will be close NVAX, which I’ve also followed for years.

The technical-

The price gapped up 2 Mondays ago, on news. At the time $10 calls were the highest options available for feb19 expiry. The price is now pinned around $10 until next week, come Monday 2/22 I suspect we will some very bullish price action. 

Upcoming catalysts: 

Week of 2/22:
1. EU final decision on hepislav-B
2. CHMP meeting with possible recommendation to make hep B vaccine part of the mandatory vaccinations recommendation.
3. Initial trial results from Biological E.
4. Earnings (2/25) - moved up two weeks ahead of schedule(hmm)

Conclusion:

The company has an approved vaccine and the future looks bright in that aspect alone. They have 6 partnerships, any one of which can send this to the moon. They are pinned under $10 so option writers don’t get completely burned. Nothing but upside in the near term. $10 calls in March should be a slam dunk. 

My position:
4,700 shares @$8.20
50 $10 calls 3/19 @ $1.45

The current situation - DD

Dvax currently has an approved hepatitis-B vaccine on the market and their revenue has been growing their revenue exponentially. The EU will vote and likely approve the vaccine as well based on final feedback to the EU commission

Now keep in mind that estimate does not take into account the launch of the 3rd subsidiary this year. The 3rd subsidiary is supposed to be revealed sometime in 2021 and AITX President Steve Reinharz has hinted that it could be a software solution that they will roll out. If they roll out some kind of impressive AI software solution that seems to have strong interest from the market, then I think my estimate could potentially go even higher.

Maybe pumping a bit, I’m sure you’re long, but hey I’ve been looking for a better synthetic biology play since Amyris can’t seem to execute on their turnaround (read: get their shit together). AMRS has so much debt/warrants/dilution from their biofuel days I don’t think they’ll recover in time to have one year of cash flow positive before their IP expires (5 years?). AMRS is also a US company, and although they are much larger they would likely have to wait for federal legalization to begin production of THC, or at least rescheduling. Typically their time to market for a finished strain is 12-18 months and Willow will likely have achieved significant market penetration at that point.

Mark my words, synbio holds the keys to the future of the entire fine chemical manufacturing industry. I could go on and on about why, but that takes all the fun out of DD!

Leveraging synbio to make THC is huge, it’s going to destroy conventional cultivation on a pure cost basis. CBG/D is great and all but we all know which 3 letters really get the people going.

Been holding KAVL, since UCRP days, so holding plenty of shares at a very low average.  I even averaged up last year when we were stuck in the $0.30-$0.40 range.

I was also concerned about the Q4 numbers, but after reading the PR, it made complete sense and all is well.

*The company believes with the recent initial acceptance letters, it will be able to formalize,* ***in short order***, *additional large distribution agreements, including some comparable in size to the recent agreement with major U.S. wholesale grocery distributor, H.T.

625,ISR," I'll mention it, posted this on another answer but will copy it here, as Denison is my favorite holding.

1. They have the potential to have a top 3 asset in the world. If they can make the ISR mining method for their deposit work, which judging from the quality of their team and recent studies would be feasible, their all in sustained costs ($8,90) and extraordinarily high grades (19.1%) will see them generate an incredible amount of free cash flow at pretty much any spot price.

2. They have the backing from some of the most wealthy people in the business. The Lundin family has a very successful record in the mining business and I believe it will not be blemished by Denison.

3. They are co-owners (22.5% stake) in the state of the art Mclean Lake Mill, which processes ore from the eastern Athabasca Basin. This stake gives them a lot of leverage, since building and permitting a new mill can take several years.

4. They have big stakes in companies like Goviex Uranium and Skyharbour, which essentially gives them another way to get a significant amount of capital should they choose to sell these stakes later in the bull market. Those have of course already increased in value substantially these past few weeks and should look to go much further in this bull market.

5. The cash flow as you already eluded to, is not that significant, but it is definitely helpful. Their fees for management of UPC and care and maintenance on idled mines generates come cash flow.

With Denison you of course buy into a great company, but you also buy into the potential. As we all know, potential is an important factor in any valuation, although it can be relatively hard to quantify. Should Denison get into production within this bull cycle with anywhere close the numbers they mentioned for Phoenix, which I think is plausible for the reasons stated earlier, they will be an absolutely incredible investment and I think the best preforming junior in the sector from this point onwards, barring some nano caps that can of course always outperform by getting a massive discovery.",3STmotivation,2,/r/pennystocks/comments/lkswin/the_emerging_global_uranium_bull_market_a_summary/gnnjjlq/,0.004,0.828,0.168,0.9967
626,ASX," Hi mate,
I picked companies that presented the highest leverage and highest gains potential.
Companies like Cameco are well establish and though will grow during bull market, they won't grow as much in terms of share price as compared to some micro caps and pennies.

 I have also focused on a number of Australian companies as Australia is the 3rd largest Uranium producer after Kazakhstan and Canada. 

 Denison is a solid looking company but lately has a pump vibe growing behind it. This may make it a target for shorting and for heavy fluctuations over the next 6-12months.

668,PI," *TL;DR their small print at the bottom needs to be bigger or else it's considered ""misleading."" Seems like it's just bad poster design and needs to be slightly redesigned.*

Complaint 1: ""Tongue and Done"" misleading because doctors/nurses must visually confirm they placed the pill in the patients mouth, because they smol. (Discouraging simplification of medication)
> Similarly, the display prominently includes the claim “TONGUE AND DONE” (bolded emphasis original). These presentations are misleading because they imply that the administration of Dsuvia consists of a simple, one-step process, when this is not the case. In fact, there are numerous administration steps outlined in the PI, including a separate, distinct step to visually confirm tablet placement in the patient’s sublingual space of the mouth.

Complaint 2: They didn't explicitly mention not to exceed 12 doses in 24 hours, but indirectly mentioned the trial only lasting 12 hours (and therefore only a max of 12 doses used).
> In addition, the banner includes the following claims (emphasis original, references omitted):
• “Minimum redosing interval 1 hour”
• “Average redosing interval 3 hours*…
*Shown over a 12-hour period in the pivotal trial.”
These claims create a misleading impression about the use of Dsuvia because the banner omits the following material information from the DOSING AND ADMINISTRATION section of the PI: “Do not exceed 12 tablets in 24 hours.”


Complaint 3: Did not source study on advertisement. I didn't verify the claim, but it seems like a pretty general and obvious claim for it's intended use. 
> Furthermore, the banner includes the claim, “DSUVIA® comes in one strength for acute pain. . .” (reference omitted). Thus, the banner makes representations about the indication and use of the drug but fails to adequately convey material information regarding Dsuvia’s limitations of use, thereby creating a misleading impression about the drug.

Basically, they need to make the small text with all their liability stuff larger. 
> Finally, the banner and display fail to present information relating to the Boxed Warning, Contraindications, Warnings and Precautions, and Adverse Reactions for Dsuvia with a prominence and readability reasonably comparable with the presentation of information relating to the benefits of Dsuvia.

All these concerns just seem to be general legal liability things that don't seem to indicate any apparent bad will of the company. These complaints are also for advertisements, not instructions for usage or informational, educational pamphlets for medical professionals (which will be the only ones administering this drug, see below). 

> Only to be administered by a healthcare provider.

>>DSUVIA is for use in adult patients only in a certified medically supervised healthcare setting.

Lastly, the warning even acknowledges that they do have complete information on the poster/banner, just that it's ""misleading"" because it's in small text at the bottom. 
>OPDP acknowledges that the banner states “DSUVIA is for use only in a certified medically supervised healthcare setting” and that the full indication including limitations of use are included farther down on the banner under the header “IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION” (ISI), (bolded emphasis added). However, unlike the benefit claims in the banner, which utilized a color background and large font, the full indication with the limitations of use are intermingled with risk information in a paragraph format in a much smaller font size and a plain white background, and are accessible only if viewers “scroll” down the banner. Therefore, this does not mitigate the misleading impression.” down the banner. Therefore, this does not mitigate the misleading impression.

Disclaimer: I don't hold any stock in the company, but was looking into it. I also don't know how common these types of warnings are, but will look into it.

So I'm not so confident just based on this though, because the stock was trading at 2.60 on the open market when they got the opportunity to buy at 2.45.  That's just free money.

And they didn't exactly go ""all in"" either, the biggest buy being less than $100,000 by the CEO of the company who makes 8.7m per year.  That's less than a weeks pay for him, and the public offering was 12m new shares, so he likely could have gone all in, but just dipped his toe as CEOs are often expected to show confidence in their own company.  The other buys were more modest.

However, I do believe having a strategy might give you a better outcome, cause eventually you feel like a fool exiting at two times the profit thinking that was the highest profit you could make but the stock keeps rising to almost 4x times the profit. With a strategy you might walk out feeling accomplished, rather than a fool.

711,PKG," A quick REJOINDER: I’ve still got a little stake in this after taking profits last week, but the best answer I’ve heard is that it’s actually being used as a reverse acquisition (reverse merger) to avoid the filing process and expedite getting PKG listed. Am keeping a few thousand shares in for the event that this is so, because it would be a quick way for it to raise both their profile and $millions to expand their operations without the hassle of going public. 

I don’t see PKGIUS going along with this for 5 months for no reason at all. It wouldn’t take their attorneys that long to figure out what it has taken some daytraders weeks to unveil. 

And to be forthright, none of the information laid out by the OP is news to me. Reverse mergers aren’t all scams, though they’re usually secretive to avoid violations. What Clemons is doing isn’t necessarily pumping up CBBT, but perhaps gving free advertising for a company that has an incredible opportunity to capitalize *right now* on some high profile clients as an alternative to filing for IPO with the SEC or FINRA.

723,PKG," What I’ve said in this post is completely fair. This company is relying on the merger to have successfully for its share price to go up - it will show that it has just become a shell company for PKG, and it will essentially just turn into PKG as a result. 

But this company has NO future in producing a device to fight Alzheimer’s. So people need to stop sharing lies that they will potentially get FDA approval for some device that has not even the slightest evidence of existing. They are a shell company. 

PKG seems like a successful company that could afford to do a direct public offering which would be less stressful and offer more potential on the market. Or even why they didn’t at least merge with a OTCQB shell company for example. Or even at least a reporting pink sheet shell, it would create a lot less hassle in terms of documentation and would give the new merged company a lot more liquidity on the market as there would be less broker restrictions. It’s also weird that a very large stake in the company is owned by EMA, who only own shares in dark or defunct companies, and more shares were purchased by them very recently. After the whole Chinese reverse merger fraud that was happening a number of years ago, the SEC pays a lot more attention to this activity. One of the main reasons private companies go for reverse mergers is that they tend to be faster than other options, but it’s been 7 months since the announcement of the Letter of Intent. Also, non reporting pink sheet shells are exempt from Rule 144, which is terrible for shareholders of PKG so draws more suspicion. 

Way too many red flags and way too much going on that would pique the interest of the SEC. There is no reason why PKG could not afford to go with a clean, reporting shell company to save them hassle and have better liquidity. This is seriously fishy business and I would suggest everyone who is a shareholder to properly research into non reporting pink sheet reverse mergers as a result.",MindlessYouth2,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/lkqnxq/before_investing_into_cbbt_read_this_be_careful/gnmmny3/,0.076,0.828,0.096,0.7088
724,PKG," No, I am not. I was previously invested in this company, did more research and uncovered a plethora of information that suggest that something isn’t right here, so I sold my shares off for a profit. CBBT is a shell company, there’s no denying this. But you have to look into non reporting pink sheet reverse mergers and question why PKG would choose to go down this route. Personally, I’m learning from carrying out my research, and I’ve replied to some other comments on this thread with more info. All I’m saying is to tread carefully and do your own research, because the way other people are talking about this company shows that they have no clue that CBBT is a shell company and has no future in Alzheimer’s research. And for PKG, a successful company with all these new sales of clearmask, its really weird how they haven’t reverse merged with a compliant pink sheet or OTCQB/BB shell, or a direct offering to go public.",MindlessYouth2,-4,/r/pennystocks/comments/lkqnxq/before_investing_into_cbbt_read_this_be_careful/gnmtnyi/,0.078,0.86,0.063,-0.1354

800,DD," It is not uncommon to reuse bike frame designs. Much like car chassis. If you look at specific types of motor cycles from different manufacturers, they are all shockingly similar. This is done to reduce the cost of manufacturing.   These are tried and tried designs.  Harley Davidson's electric motor cylce uses a slightly modified standard cruiser bike frame. 

The advantage of developing electric motor cycles should be easier than cars because the opening in the frame is for the gas engine, transmission and other driveline components. Electric motors are a lot smaller and probably needs a gear reduction (multi gear transmission, probably not necessary) and lastly to put the batter down low for lower center of gravity - gives better handling.

All that said, I am not surprised that the frame looks similar. In fact the Instagram pic looks like a very old frame design; probably came from a junk yard motorcycle.  That is not a bad thing as this is a prototype design.  So with very little effort, thay can slap it into another more modern frame. 

Lastly, I've read of a EV bike company that wants to make retro kits for the S. Asian and African market where one can swap out the gas engine for EV + battery.
