2,API," Hey guys,

It's u/nobjos back again with this week's post. I post a similar list every week.

**I have launched a site where you can track this information in real-time. Please check it out if you are interested**

Some FAQâ€™s:

How does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about the stock is positive or negative).

Can I use the code/is it open source: [Yes](https://github.com/marketsentiment/mslive_public).

What is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here is the average across all the comments. Please note that if the number of mentions is lesser than 30, the sentiment value shown might not have statistical significance.",nobjos,7,/r/pennystocks/comments/ovv2f1/most_discussed_stocks_in_pennystocks_last_week/h7bt1i5/,0.052,0.805,0.143,0.9516

15,MARA," Well it is a former penny stock that used to be discussed here.   


I played it for the first time last summer, following trevandezz on a play call here on this sub. I think he bought in at .99, and I was late to the play, but felt like there was still room. I got in at $1.12. Lol.  Imagine wondering if you are too late to play MARA at $1.12. 

The play went as predicted, and of course I was happy to make money. Canâ€™t coulda-woulda-shoulda about holding it, that is long in the past, but I have flipped it many times since then and am holding some now.

So anyway, I wonder if some of us do remember it as a penny stock and maybe specifically remember it from this sub.",dragonfliesloveme,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/ovv2f1/most_discussed_stocks_in_pennystocks_last_week/h7cgheb/,0.0,0.821,0.179,0.9714
