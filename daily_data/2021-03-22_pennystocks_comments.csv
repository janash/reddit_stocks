65,PM," Debateable. As most have said, it is always risky to invest in unproven companies. This one has been around since 2006, and in its most recent 10k filing said that they were no longer liquid, and unsure of its ability to continue. 

 [Ascent Solar Technologies, Inc. 10-Q Mar. 18, 2021 1:11 PM | Seeking Alpha](https://seekingalpha.com/filing/5437416) 

Having said that, they got a new investor willing to put up 3 million in return for 75 million shares, but with 20 billion shares outstanding and a 716 million market cap, I see some warning signs, especially as their revenue and income is so extremely poor for a company that has been listed since 2006. Their earnings have gone from 3m in 2016 to 200k this year.

HOWEVER - maybe it is finally their time, and the stock will increase dramatically and you could be on to a four, six or even a 20 bagger. 

But if you have done your research, you believe in the company and its product, then go for it,  and what ever you do, DO NOT SELL. hold the stock and in a few years or a decade you could be sitting on a small fortune.

I was tempted to punt on this stock for $50 as well but my platform doesn't trade it.

It really is educated gambling. You can take as much time as you want learning about them, learning about fundamentals and everything else, but if everyone decides they hate the company and want to sell, that's that. Is it realistic? No, but possible? Absolutely.

134,CTXR," Full disclosure, I am an MD, though I am younger and have only been working as a doctor for two years. I'm tempted to get in on CTXR but only with the intention of selling during the approval bump. I think Mino-Lok is wayyyy overhyped here. There's some stuff out there that says removing and replacing CVCs has a 20% complication rate and frankly there's just no way that's true. Or if it is, it's a misleading stat (maybe they define complications way too loosely, I saw on their website that one of the ""mechanical"" complications is hematoma, the vast majority of which are completely benign). 

In their phase IIb trial, they define mechanical complications as ""pneumothorax, hemothorax, bleeding, inability to insert a CVC at a different vascular site within 1 month of CVC removal even though a CVC was required, *and other mechanical morbidities*.""

Awesome, so they aren't even fully disclosing what this number even means. I’d also love to know what exactly “bleeding” entails, since plenty of CVCs cause insignificant bleeding.

I also question if there will be any clinical benefit to Mino-Lok (meaning actual improvement in patient-oriented outcomes like survival and morbidity), though I guess we will see when they get results from their Phase III trial.

I could be completely wrong, but this is my take on the product so far. I am trying to find other doctors’ opinions on this matter who don’t have a stake in this product (and not second-hand posts from people who talked to a doctor) and I’m having no luck. So if anyone can direct me to something like that, I’d love to see it.

1. None of their e-mails works and all the people to do with the company have left. You can try their email and check the linked in pages.
2. The GSC-TL Partners was out of Houston and there LLC is listed as out of business there.
3. The Energy Partners list MNAP as bankrupt and they are no longer helping them.
4. In 2016 the government pulled all MNP shares from the share company.
5. MNP said they had the licenses and thought they did, but the government said they did not. MNP lost this case in 2016.

In 2014 they thought they had everything setup to drill in Tajikistan. The did not. The sub companies did, but the government took MNP shares away. Kinda strange, but you can find the court proceedings. Investors either pulled out or went bankrupt. Workers all left.

Used in a lot of industrial applications. Also frequently in analytical instrumentation and medical devices. Used because it is inert and has a small atomic/molecular size.
US reserve is being allowed to be depleted because up to this point was a low value byproduct that had a short span of capture/interest decades ago (space race among others). It is more expensive to maintain the depot than to buy on the spot market.
We already went through a previous ""helium panic"" about 5 years ago which amounted to nothing. 
There may be a business case here but He is a byproduct of petroleum and gas production, simply vented off as it has little value.
At any moment, initiation of He capture by a larger organization could wipe this rising value out.

239,THC," This one has been on my radar for several years. I wish I had bought some and sold during the early February run. Otcmarkets.com has this one listed as a ""Caveat Emptor"" and so I've stayed away. If it gets back down to 0.001 or below I might invest a couple hundred. A lot of these THC stocks are worthless and going nowhere. However, if some politician in DC utters the words Marijuana and legalization in the same sentence they tend to shoot up for a few days for some quick profit.",cjtaylor8281,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/ma8jqv/sugarmade_sgmd_and_fundamentals/grrk1mi/,0.057,0.868,0.075,0.1531

Think through the series of events I just posted and make a decision if you think they’re good enough to invest a little in. I’ve already locked in $5k+ from trading this company and I don’t think they’re close to being done.

243,IP," My understanding of stocks is [garbage](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fi.pinimg.com%2Foriginals%2Fd6%2F21%2F01%2Fd62101019fb409440bc76ab1bff7b2cf.jpg&f=1&nofb=1) but I do like science and understanding the [diagnostic assay](https://xphyto.com/xphyto-announces-european-approval-for-25-minute-covid-19-pcr-test/) seems key here so here's some points to consider:

&#x200B;

* This isn't new science. This technology has been around a long time. The innovation comes from the protocol/procedure they are using to cut down on the turnaround time. The steps that seem to be optimized is the prep time (not doing anything to the samples, direct use from patients) and limiting the actual ""amplification"" to one 20 minute step. 
* As best as I can figure, they have optimized their RNA Probe for efficient hybridization and cut down on sample preparation prior to PCR. Seems like they went for a hyper lean approach with minimal hands on work and maximized the activity of the PCR components. Such an approach can be extremely efficient but does not allow for much room to quickly optimize if real world results don't compare to laboratory validation.
* The 25 minute turnaround time is the amplification time (20 minute) plus the detection time (5 minutes). This does not include time needed for sample collection, nor does it take into account backlogs. The bottleneck here is the machine i.e. how many samples can one machine run. The assertion that traditional PCRs take hours is correct, days is somewhat correct if you take into account sample backlog.  
* This test is an Reverse transcriptase Real Time (RT) PCR. The way this works is that any RNA (like from COVID-19) is first identified via RNA probe (introduced by the PCR test) binding (hybridization) to the COVID-19 RNA. Then a protein called reverse transcriptase binds to the RNA probe resulting in downstream amplification. This probe is KEY; without this probe binding to the target RNA, reverse transcriptase cannot work. For this PCR test to be specific to COVID-19, the Probe must be bind to COVID-19 sequence. That's hidden behind IP as I can't seem to find what sequence it actually binds to. Unknown if this can detect all variants of COVID-19 as I can't seem to find what the target actually is. The company did not mention if they tested for COVID-19 variants. 
* Traditional Reverse transcriptase converts single stranded target RNA to double stranded RNA by filling in the complementary pieces with fluorescently-tagged nucleotides (part of the PCR kit). If COVID-19 is present, then the machine looks for an increase in the fluorescence. 
* Fluorescence threshold must be crossed for this test to conclude if sample is COVID positive. Fluorescence increases as multiple copies of the target RNA is made, which requires multiple cycles. This PCR test is a single cycle. Therefore, this test is meeting the minimum fluorescence threshold by amplifying from multiple RNA copies from each virus particle instead of a few RNA copies amplified hundreds of times. This is what they mean when they state the limit of detection is 104 c (copies) /PCR.
* Grain of salt: I have no idea what percentage of patients with COVID passed this test. I can't seem to find the actual publication of results. Their sensitivity is presented on their webpage as how many RNA molecules (104 copies) they can detect but it does NOT present how often they detect COVID positive patients and importantly, how often they miss cases (aka false negatives; negative predictive value). If someone found, feel free to share. 
* 100% specificity is nothing special. In diagnostics, if your test isn't at least 95% specific to your target, then you've either got an inefficient product or the target you're trying to detect is an absolute chameleon. COVID is not a chameleon. 
* This kind of assay can be implemented in less sophisticated sites such as rural hospitals, pop-up clinics, etc. However, the limiting factor here is the use of a Real-Time PCR machine. This assay cannot work without it and those machines are relatively inexpensive relative to other hospital/laboratory machines but they are not cheap. Feel free to look up Ebay/Amazon Science/ThermoFisher/Bio-Rad/Agilent for cost of a benchtop option (cheapest option). 
* Price of the machine matters because this will affect WHO can use this test i.e. who will buy this test. I like the concept of this test and I would love to see this in medical deserts e.g. rural areas, inner cities, regions/countries with less developed healthcare infrastructure. 
*  A lateral move to other diseases is possible but it would require complete optimization of the RNA probe to strictly match the target RNA. There are other RNA viruses that cause disease that this can detect. New probe and different amplification protein (replacing reverse transcriptase) for DNA viruses. Bacterial diagnostic approach would require detecting DNA, same as DNA viruses. Probe design will be significantly more difficult as the bacterial genomes are MUCH larger than viruses (ex: E. coli genome is >4,000,000 nucleotide bases vs COVID-19's 30,00 nucleotide bases). It will be extremely difficult to design a probe for bacteria that is specific to one species of bacteria. Furthermore, bacterial genomes (and some DNA viruses) are double stranded so there will need to be a heat step included in the PCR procedure to separate the strands. COVID-19 has a single-stranded genome so this step is not necessary.

Anyhow, my Exas is up 2456% and I wish I would have added much more on the lows- back than I thought I 100% knew where that was heading. So I swore to myself that whenever I do see another very obvious 20X winner I will bet the Farm. 
So this is why all my posts are about  Biolargo because it is my hobby and I sold almost all of my other investments as I believe this is the best investment opportunity out there. 
Of cause I get excited when I find posts like the one above of Someone seeing it precisely the same way.
