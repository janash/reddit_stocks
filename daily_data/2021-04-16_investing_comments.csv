The rules need to be changed, so we are all on the same playing field cause right now its only one way. They need to be removed out of the system so they can’t create this constant manipulation and corruption. We can once again have what is rightfully ours and for our kids future.

28,HSBC," No, they're not.

HSBC will decide which markets and exchanges to offer their clients. The London Stock Exchange, the NASDAQ, etc. Investment managers and IFAs can legally advise you on specific companies to invest in, and make decisions on your behalf. 

But retail sharedealing portals (where users just choose stocks at their own risk) *are not allowed to offer you advice or make decisions on your behalf*.

So HSBC are offering whole markets but then banning investment in two specific companies within those markets, based on their own subjective opinion on the merits of those businesses. 

That crosses a line, because it's my risk and the companies I invest in are my choice alone. Plenty of people lose money on the stock exchange, plenty of companies go bust too. Frankly that's how the stock market works - for you to make money, there usually has to be someone on the other side losing money. 

The stock market's been around for centuries, and for HSBC to suddenly step in and block people from investing in certain things is unprecedented. 

Let's not pretend HSBC are suddenly flouting FCA rules to try and protect private investors from losses. If that's true, they'd have to ban every tobacco, arms, gambling and fossil fuel company, every company that's had a tough year and every company with a declining share price for whatever reason.

29,HSBC," >It is perfectly fine for a financial institution to limit the risk exposure for their business and their customers

If customers buy shares then it doesn't expose HSBC to any risk. The owners of the shares take all the risk, that's always been the case. Their website is covered in warnings saying so. Let's not pretend HSBC has suddenly developed a conscience around people with trading losses. 

""Limiting exposure"" to certain shares is tantamount to giving financial advice and controlling customers behavior. I don't believe HSBC's sharedealing platform is setup for them to give advice, and I don't think the regulator would approve of that either. It's unlawful.

And if we support that behavior, do we also support HSBC stopping people buying other shares that their management don't like? You're in agreement that they should control customers behavior around crypto, what else should we let them control? HSBC are big in oil, should they ban their customers from buying shares in renewable energy?

Can they also start blocking your spending on retail businesses they don't like either?

&#x200B;

The entire idea of the free market is that people will behave differently and are free to do so. If you don't believe in crypto, that's fine - don't buy any. Personally I don't believe in hydrogen power, but if I ran a bank I'd never attempt to stop people buying shares in legal, regulated hydrogen companies.

Because this is an established policy. Read the first and fourth bullet-point. They are simply enforcing their user agreement. You can either abide by it, or not. This is nothing new, they have had it for a long time.

>For example, if I owned a car dealership and refused to sell a car to anyone that had a motorcycle license, it wouldnt be unreasonable to to ask about it and potentially think its a stupid position to hold, regardless of it ultimately being my right to do so.

You are free to ask but it is very unlikely that they will change their current policy because a few customers think it is inconvenient. They might change their mind if too many or large, important customers have a problem with it.

The thing is, you need to understand that HSBC is a large, international bank. These institutions are very well-regulated and they have to comply with a lot of laws and regulations. A bank will never turn away a profitable customer voluntarily; it is possible that they simply are complying with the laws of a specific jurisdiction by banning their customers from using their platform for trading cryptocurrencies. 

HSBC has large operations in Asia, particularly China. [Since 2017, it is illegal to trade cryptocurrencies in China.](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/02/china-bitcoin-mining-hub-to-shut-down-cryptocurrency-projects.html).

56,CGC," I’ve looked into many a company fins, and while I’m no expert, I’ve got to say that the revenue growth is there, but the market is hasn’t priced it in anywhere near as much as many others, especially nowhere near tech, EV, cyber security, etc.

At one point, CGC was trading at something like 280 p/s ratio in 2018! That was a fun ride. Some $28B in value for a really poorly run, fundamentally weak business. 

These cannabis companies are still insulated from rapid growth (before any kind of reasonable adoption is baked in and then some) because they trade on OTC / CSE. So I’m calling this an accumulation phase. We’ve somewhat got the green light from politicians. Many states have already or are moving towards adult use cannabis. They need the tax revenue.

Here’s a little hint... While fundamentals don’t look that bad here, we’re not investing in fundamentals. We’re investing in politics. While the next few months may be rocky, I believe that we’ll see major movement in the fall. I’m banking on some serious law reform roughly around the 2022 mid term elections.

58,REAL," I'm curious about the exit strategy here aside from potential international money laundering (and even then, I'm not REAL sure how it works).

Like, I see the stock has some pretty solid dips and peaks for a company with essentially no revenue and no statements... 

Does it basically want to work like one of the fake companies holding stock lists it at a specific lowball price arranged by whoever has the dirty money, they buy the stock with the dirty money, then turn around and flip the stock to a second clean money company so the original 3-faced company (the Coach/kingpin, shell 1, shell 2) retains the money minus whatever ""fee"" which is the difference in the discounted ask price and the inflated buy price.  The person/company in the middle gets the clean money, the kingpin still retains the stock.  Because stock market transactions in the millions by investment companies are fairly routine and maybe difficult to track there's no real easy way to determine if these are really fraudulent transactions or not?  

I'm sure there's something else to this that I'm not understanding since it seems like it'd be fairly easy to track the distribution of capital around these companies and there's only 9 major shareholders and the volume on the stock is not a lot.

Side note: I was actually bullish on retail clothing stocks this entire I.E TLYS, KSS, M, ZUMZ, ANF, NKE etc because you will see that the closing of brick and mortar stores is actually good for these companies. 

Anyways, the point being QQQ and the rest of the market is somewhat healthy. You will see the inflated stocks fall off such as DoorDash and GME but there are actually a lot of stock that are better off now than before the pandemic.",jon-mcman,2,/r/investing/comments/mrz9re/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/guqiepz/,0.011,0.894,0.095,0.8691

It's like the epitome of the old joke, ""Sure, we're losing money on each unit sold, but we'll make it up on volume.""  

I'm definitely no expert, though, and my investment philosophy is pretty risk-averse, preferring established stocks with a history of good earnings, so for maybe for somebody less risk-averse, it makes sense.  I do understand the appeal of getting in on the ground floor of something new and big that may be disruptive.  But at some point I feel like earnings have to matter.  

It's similar to how I feel about UBER. Bleeding money year after year to the tune of nearly $20B, fighting to be dominant in a market with razor thin margins.

151,OUT," # Wave Trend Oscillators/Squeeze Momentum Indicators and their Relationship to Time Ranges(Candlesticks) and Trade Frequency.

 

So I was just introduced to Wave Trend Oscillators and Squeeze Momentum Indicators and I'm loving them. They're really helping me pick those Entry and Exit points that I've normally had to Eyeball with just a MACD or RSI.

But I've also noticed something else as well.

When I'm looking at the 30, 15 and 5 Second ranges, I have a lot better luck getting OUT of a Trade at the right spot, where as looking at the 1, 3 or 5 minute ranges are a lot better for spotting when you ENTER a trade.

(Is this normally how its done anyways? Or could this just be more how I personally read them?)

My Biggest question though is this;

How do the different time ranges (Candlesticks) relate to each other and ""Real Time"".

For example, If I'm looking to trade 1 or two times a day, what Time Range should I be looking at to get an indication of where it might be heading the next day?

Say the Trend Oscillators and Squeeze Momentum Indicators are showing a downward trend with 5, 15, and 30 minute candles, but a stronger upward trend with the 1, 2 and 4 hour Candles?

157,GME," This recent meme/crypto craze has created some massive FOMO for me. In order to curb that, I am planning on doing some passive investing instead. We were originally planning on buying a home, but with the market the way it is, I'm not planning on buying for at least 2 years.


Currently, I (27 years, making 100k) have: 

150k in 401k (All in SP500) 

53k in Roth IRA (All in SP500) 

17k in Individual Account (60% in Total Market ETF, 40% in International Stock Market ETF) 

45k in bank account 

10k in savings


My current plan would be to place 5k more into my savings account (add to already high emergency fund), then place 30k into my Individual Account. I'd probably do the same thing and do 60/40 for Total Market/International ETF.

The amount of money folks have made over the recent year on GME/Crypto has really given me some massive FOMO. But I'm trying to stick to a long-term conservative investment plan. And having 40k sitting untouched doesn't seem to do me any favors!

I always assumed that the companies don’t necessarily have to be Chinese as long as companies in the fund generate revenue in China. Such that the total revenue generated by all companies in the fund is representative of the world economy. 

Do the holdings of VT indeed have a lot of revenue in China or if not should one invest in a true China etf like

Any suggestion for that exposure?

Problem with the healthcare/medical space is that many stocks & ETFs have already front-runned you to them and they are above the pre-covid levels. XLV/VHT/IBB are all 20-30% above pre-covid levels.

Even ETFs that should be laggards like IHI/XHE which do the equipment have rocketed past their pre-covid highs.",zxc123zxc123,2,/r/investing/comments/mrow7p/investing_in_us_pharma_manufacturing/gunt2hn/,0.023,0.908,0.069,0.6486
172,MRK," Interesting. I got my healthcare space exposure in early in JNJ. Picked up some PAND after I saw insiders buying at prices higher than market price. I guess I was lucky and it paid off big when it got absorbed by MRK. So I rolled that and some extra $$$ into MRK during the last dip.

Any suggestion for that exposure?

173,API," So, unless they are planning to compete with generic drug makers, which are actually chemical plants for the active pharmaceutical ingredients... Well, it is already a failure.

The API plants in India and China are MASSIVE. one of them has their own pier. Yeah, they produce that much generic API.

We just can't compete on price, as those products are pennies per pound. You won't buy American at dollars per pound.

So, yeah, good luck.",Megahuts,1,/r/investing/comments/mrow7p/investing_in_us_pharma_manufacturing/guoj29t/,0.038,0.777,0.185,0.8918

175,AMD," This is 100% correct and it is also seen in the semiconductor chip industry.

Nobody wants to manufacture chips anymore because a factory is too expensive to build AND maintain.   To reduce costs, manufacturing has been consolidated into just a few companies whose sole purpose is to maintain the highest production output and efficiency, while other companies provide the designs.

For example Apple, AMD et al just needs people to sit in the office and design the CPU on some sort of CAD software, then send it off to TSMC to be produced.

I can see how such business model would apply to the pharma industry, or at least this also shows why  a small mid size company trying to manufacture its own products is a logistical impossibility when existing factories are already controlled other mega giant corporations.",c00750ny3h,2,/r/investing/comments/mrow7p/investing_in_us_pharma_manufacturing/guorzam/,0.0,0.981,0.019,0.3612
176,TXMD," >It seems very promising..

That's the exact opposite of what you're saying [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TXMD/comments/mria70/hurting_today_mates/gume0wt/?context=3).  This sounds like a pump and dump, and it's a good way to get Reddit to cough up your identity to some lawyers and SEC investigators.

**EDIT:  All please note this is a professional pump-and-dump scam ... the company itself was charged for misinforming buy side analysts last year.  There is a TXMD sub coordinating efforts to inflate the value of this worthless company that has had negative earnings and negative cash flow for at least 12 straight quarters.**

From [Marketwatch](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/therapeuticsmd-stock-slides-6-after-sec-charges-company-with-breaking-disclosure-rules-2019-08-20):

>The stock rallied 19.4% in heavy volume the following day, even though the company had not issued a press release or made a public disclosure about the meeting. On July 17 of the same year, the company issued a press release saying it had submitted additional information to the regulator but did not yet have a clear path toward approval. The stock fell 16% premarket. The SEC then found that in a call and email to sell-side analysts, the company shared further details of its initial FDA meeting, which analysts then included in research notes that helped the stock rebound to close the regular session down just 6.6%.",th3cr1t1c,5,/r/investing/comments/mrxy0v/txmd_long_term_investment/gur2ueg/,0.071,0.853,0.075,0.196
