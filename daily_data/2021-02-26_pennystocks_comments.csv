Refuting the ""AABB is a SCAM - My Deep Dive and Evidence PART 2"" Post POINT BY POINT

This post is in reply to the post mentioned in the Title. Posting here as automods keep deleting my reply in the original subthread ""pennystocks"".

Yes, at quick glance the OP may have uncovered something fishy going on with AABB. However, if you take a second longer to think about the content he has provided, you can see there is one crucial thing he conveniently has left out: SOURCES. Screenshots taken out of context can be VERY misleading, so I figured I would take the time to provide you all with links and some additional context, Before jumping to some hasty accusations, I implore you do your own DD. I have helped you get started by going over the all of the OP's original points :)

https://fundanna.com/equity/offer-summary/CannaSOS

There is a Core State Holdings that is Canada-based, and a Core State Holdings that is USA-based, which was started by the original Canadian company in order to establish a presence in the US. The USA-based company is still young, which makes much more sense as to why it is seeking crowd-funding, at least much more so that OP's accusation of the ""seeking to launder some money.""

Further down on that same page they even reference the partnership with Asia Broadband, and go into further detail here:https://ptpwallet.com/2020/12/08/core-state-holdings-corp-enters-into-crypto-partnership-with-asia-broadband-inc-otc-aabb/

SO it seems this number is Oleg's professional phone number. Makes sense to me that if he was the President of Acelloria AND Core State Holdings that he would simply use his own phone number. Either way, when I completed a Google searched for the phone number, all top results were for Core State Holdings. The only way I found any connection to Acelloria was by searching for the ""416-471-7884 + Acelloria"". For OP to claim that was the result, he would have had to search for that exact string of text.

Now for the CSH team...

https://www.linkedin.com/in/oleg-cheine-84bb564b/

Here is the LinkedIn page I found for Oleg. Slightly different than the one OP posted, but apparently much more up to date. Here it shows he stopped working for Acelloria in 2014.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/larissa-podhostnik-zagnitko-82b32428/

As to the reference for Larissa Podhostnik not referencing CSH in her LinkedIn? She is an Independent Consultant! As a consultant, you don't list every single company you have consulted for.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/a-yakovlev/

And of course OP didn't include a screenshot showing Anton does mention CSH on his LinkedIn page. He worked there for some time then left. Why he left? Idk, more money/better offer? And why is he still listed on CSH's website? Maybe the fact he was a Co-founder? Again, idk. What I do know is my own company had someone who worked for the company but left still on the website for a while.

RE: PTPEstate

https://ptpestate.com/the-first-building-is-ready-to-go-through-real-estate-digitalization/real-estate-digitalization/admin/

OP states the article above talks about Harry White (who is confirmed to be the building owner), and references the building as being the first sale for PTPEstate. Except there is no mention of a sale. It appears that they are partnering with him on the project for 434 King St to turn it into a multi-use site. As OP didn't provide any links, I couldn't verify whether Harry White was in fact also a member of the CSH team. But here is the link to the CSH website I found:https://corestateholdings.com/. You can scroll down to see the full Team.

Anyways, back to the project at King St. The screenshot shows a dilapidated building, and says that is reason enough essentially to be weary. No shit! It is a property that went under (an old theater), and White saw the location's potential and thought he could make some money off it by developing the site. Here is a link talking about the building after some strong winds knocked off some bricks:https://www.thespec.com/news/hamilton-region/2020/01/02/city-of-hamilton-issues-unsafe-order-at-former-king-street-west-theatre.html

Of course OP only posted a screenshot without any context. There are plans for development of the site. I have personally sold real estate and actually understand the nature of RE development, OP obviously does not or hopes, at least, that you all don't.

In regards to the issuance of stocks to Luis Vega, here is the link to the report OP did not provide:https://backend.otcmarkets.com/otcapi/company/financial-report/263765/content

I did have trouble finding much information on Luis Vega (very common name apparently). What I do know is that the issuance of stocks was for Debt Conversion, This is typical when someone has loaned money to a company and the said company repays original loan through issuance of common stocks. This is a very common practice. My best guess is Luis is connected in some way to one of their mining operations via some sort of loan/funding of a project and AABB repaid him back through these common stocks.

As for the address 7260 W. Azure Dr #140, Ste 1025, Las Vegas NV, 89130?? Either it was OP's first time using Google maps or her purposefully didn't provide a link. You search the address and yes a parking lot shows up, but you need to turn the view around to see the business from the other direction. Either way, here look at the google maps your safe, do a 180 turn and BOOM! THERE IT IS!!

https://www.mostlymaillv.com/ <---- link to the Mostly Mail website. Not sure why they have a racoon as their profile pic in Google Maps lol. But the point is the address is for Mostly Mail, a provider of mailbox rentals! Not uncommon for someone to use this type of address with their business deals.

Next up is Nicholas Corian and Homescape LLC. First off, government documents typically don't have accents on words or names. Either way, here is Nicholas's LinkedIn:https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicholas-coriano/

. Guess what line of work he is in....VENTURE CAPITAL and PRIVATE EQUITY INDUESTRY!!! The dude invests money for a living!! But did the OP want you to know that or didn't research that for himself? Who knows? But Nicholas does not appear to be pumping the stock. The better guess is that he loaned money to AABB and was repaid through issuance of common stock. Again, very typical in business dealings.

Guess what OP, you were right, this is all public information. And either you didn't dig deep enough or didn't provide full context on purpose hoping everyone else would take what you said at face value.

He brings up so interesting points:

Refuting the ""AABB is a SCAM - My Deep Dive and Evidence PART 2"" Post POINT BY POINT

This post is in reply to the post mentioned in the Title. Posting here as automods keep deleting my reply in the original subthread ""pennystocks"".

Yes, at quick glance the OP may have uncovered something fishy going on with AABB. However, if you take a second longer to think about the content he has provided, you can see there is one crucial thing he conveniently has left out: SOURCES. Screenshots taken out of context can be VERY misleading, so I figured I would take the time to provide you all with links and some additional context, Before jumping to some hasty accusations, I implore you do your own DD. I have helped you get started by going over the all of the OP's original points :)

There is a Core State Holdings that is Canada-based, and a Core State Holdings that is USA-based, which was started by the original Canadian company in order to establish a presence in the US. The USA-based company is still young, which makes much more sense as to why it is seeking crowd-funding, at least much more so that OP's accusation of the ""seeking to launder some money.""

75,CEO," You might want to read up on defamation per se. Alleging that they were engaged in criminal activity provides them with a simple legal avenue to sue, and it doesn't matter if it was a redditor or the pope.

I doubt they do it, but mostly because they would struggle to collect damages from the redditor.

76,IMO," Defamation per se doesn't require intent. It applies to allegations of criminal activity, which I believe the post here alleged (money laundering).

He crossed a line, IMO. I don't think a single redditor is worth suing, damages wise, but they may still sue because:
A) if they think it helps clear their name, or
B) if they can link his post to other activity done in concert. As in, if a group of people conspired to drop the stock price, for whatever reason.

Or is it the other way around and it becomes 13 million x $1.90 = $26 million and now that $26 million gets added to the original $173.5 million making the new total to be $200 million

271,AAPL," This may be counter-intuitive, but penny stocks, because they are cheaper, are actually higher risk than more expensive ones.  True, you can buy 10 shares for less capital, but its probably going to be a riskier investment.

For example if you have $100 to spend, you can buy 100 shares of some random penny stock, which might skyrocket and double your money.  Or it could drop by 50% overnight.  Both can happen.

Bigger companies, like say AAPL seldom do either.  So you could buy 1 share of Apple and feel pretty confident that 6 months from now you are still going to have your original 100, and probably a little more.

With a penny stock, the price is often more volatile.  In 6 months you could have $300 or nothing from your original 100.",UMHB_Prof,2,/r/pennystocks/comments/lspt07/the_lounge_thoughts_noob_stuff_low_effort_brokers/gotxq8r/,0.054,0.75,0.196,0.9714

I'm not saying thats you but that is the current problem. Because everyone is all in the same stocks when they crash because experienced investors have taken their profits after pumping it in groups leaving all the inexperienced guys holding afterwards. 

There's a lot of stocks being touted in these groups and pages that are not good prospects at all yet they get aggressively pushed using technical sounding terminology. And people just accept it.

297,ZOM," Chasing greed.  Thinking I was a genius when plays went well and not selling. Selling a position only to IMMEDIATELY take that money and put it into another position rather than waiting to find the next play. 


Now I will still do stupid things because this penny game is fun and riding rising stocks is still a viable strategy, but I‚Äôll do something like buy 200 of a stock for $1 if it climbs up to like $2 I‚Äôll sell 50 shares ($100 back) then when/if it tumbles down I‚Äôll set a stop loss at $1.50 to sell 50 more.  (75back). 

Then I‚Äôll let the rest ride to see if I can make major profits and sell if it crashes down to original $1 accept that I made my money and maybe I should‚Äôve cashed more earlier but, I try not to buy back in when the stock inevitably climbs again.  

Stocks I‚Äôm currently Heavy in are $ZOM at .45 average, $CTXR at 1.53 average, and $TLSS at .04 avg. 

I like all 3 of these plays a lot and I‚Äôve already sold half of my ZOM for an avg of $1.50 I‚Äôm riding the rest of it to try to make a get rich play but I know that I made my money on it no matter what so I don‚Äôt need to be worrying about every dip or every Green Day I want to see big payout on it. 

$TLSS still hasn‚Äôt hit its big shot yet and I‚Äôm comfortable holding it but I sold about 25% at .08 to basically lower my buy in. 

$CTXR I sold 20% of my position at 2.40 for the same reason. 

A lot of times your stock will spike way earlier than you expected and it‚Äôs foolish to not try to take back some profits to lower your risk.     Yes you miss out on the super moon, but you also buy yourself a parachute If the rocket blows up before it‚Äôs destination.  



All and all I would say the biggest lesson I learned is to take part of my profits when I get them and STOP buying immediately back in with that money.  I would buy for $100 turn it into $500 with pure luck then turn around and put $450 back in a different position only to watch it die.  


Those are the some of the lessons I‚Äôve learned and I hope you can grow too when we start having green weeks again.",LeoFireGod,14,/r/pennystocks/comments/lspt07/the_lounge_thoughts_noob_stuff_low_effort_brokers/gosz1up/,0.079,0.764,0.157,0.9888

324,AM," Yeah, I use reddit to get ticker names, and the first thing I'll do is look at the 1-year chart and if there was already a pop I move on (most of what gets posted here is 48-72 hours ""into the pump and dump"" phase and you're too late to the game if you are looking to buy some of these tickers while they are in the middle of a >30% increase on the day).

But if I see some flattening without major pump and dump activity over the previous couple months, I'll throw a couple hundred dollars at some tickers throughout the week and just treat it as a gamble/game. I won't lose more than a couple hundred, but some of these have significant returns (>30%) if you catch it during the run up. And I don't let greed get in the way. If I see 25% profit, I sell. I don't care that it ran up 100% in the day and I miss the peak (happens all the time), because I hit my price target and got out. And there will always be another one tomz. That's the beauty of penny stocks. If I don't find something in the morning, I sit out for the day. I try to stay away from midday buys on things that already made the jump in the AM hours. FOMO is real, but I curb it by keeping to ""my rules.""

Don't jump on things that have already popped, or is still ""popping"" because more than likely that reddit post is 24-48 hours too late and the gains are about to dry up...and at that point if you are buying on the pump side, more than likely you'll find yourself literally buying at its peak and you just screwed yourself. Walk away from things that are ""hot"" for the day. You already missed the boat 90% of the time if it's already at 30% increase for the day.

I haven't done any of my own DD except for very surface level, so anyone reading please take everything I'm saying with a chuck of salt.

I was seriously under the impression with the previous 2 leagues (AAF and XFL2) that there seemed to be local fan interest, enough to support some kind of ""minor league"", but the leagues did not seem to be run appropriate to that level of interest. It appeared to me (again I don't know what I'm talking about here, keep in mind), that the owners of both just assumed they were going to be major league in the first year and financed the leagues that way.

It seems to me that avoiding NFL markets, cultivating a local fan base, and budgeting for that, \*should\* be a workable strategy, but again remember I don't know what I'm talking about.

I haven't looked at any SEC filings here, do you know what percent of ownership of the league the outstanding common stock has? I assume the founder/CEO kept majority ownership, but that's again just guessing.

I think maybe the most interesting thing for sports leagues is there aren't really many modern precedents or models for ""better than obscurity"" - the major leagues all formed around when mass communication and easier transportation over long distances came along, and the AFL, WHA and ABA were all merged into their big brother leagues over 40 years ago.",Bill_Blazejowski,3,/r/pennystocks/comments/lt4jlk/take_a_look_and_evaluate_company_a/govqybo/,0.017,0.84,0.143,0.9837

I haven't looked at any SEC filings here, do you know what percent of ownership of the league the outstanding common stock has? I assume the founder/CEO kept majority ownership, but that's again just guessing.

I think maybe the most interesting thing for sports leagues is there aren't really many modern precedents or models for ""better than obscurity"" - the major leagues all formed around when mass communication and easier transportation over long distances came along, and the AFL, WHA and ABA were all merged into their big brother leagues over 40 years ago.",Bill_Blazejowski,3,/r/pennystocks/comments/lt4jlk/take_a_look_and_evaluate_company_a/govqybo/,0.017,0.84,0.143,0.9837
388,WWR," I put WWR on my watch list after finding them in a search if Texas bases mining companies. Did a little digging and like everything i saw on them. I will keep them on my watch list and see if I can get on board when the dip nears bottom. I am with you though, they are going to be a great company if everything they are moving towards pans out.",Gnobodyuknow,2,/r/pennystocks/comments/lsnced/research_on_wwr_what_did_i_miss/goskn3k/,0.0,0.906,0.094,0.7458
