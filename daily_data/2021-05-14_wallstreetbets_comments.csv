130,AMC," (Reuters) - Shares in heavily shorted AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings were up 4.0% in heavy trading on Friday, with the cinema operator the top focus on social media forums popular among retail investors.
The gain was forcing bearish investors out of their positions, according to one analyst who watches short-sellers.
AMC last traded at $13.28 after rising as high as $14.34 earlier in the session, with volume 2.5 times the 10-day moving average and the stock the most-heavily traded on all exchanges.

224,BIG," Funny story about Jim Cramer.  Can't find it anywhere online, but this did happen.  In the early 2000's, Jim hosted a syndicated radio show - it may have been ""Mad Money"" or similar.  It ran on our local talk station in the early evenings, and I would listen to every broadcast with rapt attention - not so much for the individual stock picks but I really liked his general philosophy and enthusiasm for investing.  I found the show to be infectious (in a positive way) and did go on to buy at least one of his books which was not a half bad read.  To be fair, I still like his passion, but not necessarily his picks.

Anyway, one night on his radio show, Jim was really pimping his ""special guest"" who would be on in the next hour to discuss investing - it was his wife at the time (I believe it was Karen) and he was building up her appearance in a BIG way.  By the time she got behind the microphones, he was introducing her as the most amazing woman, ""the goddess of stock-picking"" (really, I remember that phrase like it was yesterday), and she would be on the air to lend us mortals her divine insights into the stock market and we would all be witness to the unequalled inspiration and knowledge that would flow from her lips.

THE WORD 'FAIL' WAS INVENTED THAT EVENING.  After such a build-up with James lapping at her feet and worshipping her as such an amazing financial mind, Jim began to ask her some reasonable, normal questions about her thoughts on the market.  She responded with nothing but recalcitrant short phrases and snippy, one-word answers such as ""well, what do YOU think?"", ""that's hard to tell"", ""I don‚Äôt know ‚Äì why would I know?‚Äù, ""maybe"", ""yes"", ""no"".  This was not her being nervous ‚Äì it was clear to me that she was sabotaging the show by being recalcitrant, obstinate, and rebellious towards him and not giving so much as an inch of insight.

The word malicious doesn‚Äôt even begin to describe her appearance that night.

Despite Jim‚Äôs continued groveling at her feet during the interview, it very quickly became clear she was doing her very best to undermine him.  You could cut the tension with a knife ‚Äì and this was over the radio.  Anyway, after my jaw dropped, my heart also sank as I listened to this debacle ‚Äì I don‚Äôt think that I was ever more embarrassed for another person as I was for Jim on his national radio show that night.

Again, I admire Jim‚Äôs enthusiasm and some of his general philosophy, but that episode of his radio show was an absolute fail.  And I don‚Äôt blame him, other than perhaps for not vetting his wife and her demeanor toward him before he invited her on his radio show.",Tech1200MkIII,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nc8sj2/cnbcs_jim_cramer_is_so_full_of_shit/gy55k16/,0.063,0.782,0.154,0.9952

Every one is panicking about the ""sToRm"" and my stocks are increasing in value while everything else tanks.

‚ÄúIt is a pleasure [to be here]‚Ä¶ Your studio looks smaller in person.

Now it's true that many investors have fared poorly in the recent downturn, but there are also plenty of people out there who are managing to ride this thing out by using a thing called diversification: spreading out all of your investments. Let me show you what I mean here. *chart*

You see here that stocks are down 34 points over a two-year period. People who invested in commodities did slightly better and while Treasury notes are down, one group of investors is doing well: the super-rich. They're actually doing great!

Now we don't have the bar graph technology to show you how high their portfolios have risen but if you look out of the window of our offices you'll get some idea. [Their bar] is about six stories taller. 

You see, by starting with lots and lots and lots of money you can still fall back on your gigantic wad even if you lose some.

I recommend Old Money. Once it's been in the family a while it's just about impossible to lose it. Even if you are a complete Fuckup!

**JS**: What about the people who don't have huge fortunes though?

Well Jon, they should have planned ahead. Now is no time not to
be rich. You have to get creative. Think outside the box. Consider meme stocks. Yes there is a lot of junk out there but for those of you who do your homework, opportunities abound.

For example, take a look at this mint condition collection of AMC calls. Isn't that gorgeous? These calls print on some arbitrary day that has no relation to financial performance and allows AMC to continue using retail investors as a literal ATM! I mean, who knows what these calls could be worth in a couple of years?!

**JS**: But- but Steve I think people looking at more traditional investment instruments such as real estate... 

Okay well the housing market lags the economy so real estate could be in for a rough ride. But these calls- I mean just look at them! Each one bought on margin from the most ironically named brokerage ever!

Jon, what do you think these calls would go for retail?

**JS**: 20 bucks?

More like 9000! But for a limited time they can be yours for only $299! $299 . That's less than $300 for calls that you and your family will cherish as it goes up and up and up in value! Jon, I am rating these calls an official stonk and a strong Buy!

**JS**: Hey that- that's very nice. But we're trying to focus on sound investments here‚Ä¶

Okay! All right, I know who I am dealing with here. You are a savvy investor! Fine, I will throw in this collection of commemorative stonks including BB, NOK, & CLOV!

333,DD," To be frank, the continued downward movement of PLTR is a symptom of general market bearishness rather than an indictment of the company itself. The only true strike mark against them is with regards to stock based compensation maturing in this time frame, which means that they are in a period of dilution. That said, a multitude of government contracts which are growing in value and number, rapid expansion into the private sector, and one deep ass moat around their technology means that this company isnt going anywhere for the foreseeable future, and actually should be increasing in value far faster than the rate of dilution. Recent earnings were bullish as hell, with all goals met or beat, and 30% YoY guidance reaffirmed. 

In short, my estimation is that the bearish market right now is a blessing in disguise, as I expect this stock to slingshot upwards in value when market conditions permit. From there, I believe it will stabilize at a significantly higher price per share. At that point, long term high returns will most likely continue unless or until guidance is revised to a lower level.

The only true strike mark against them is with regards to stock based compensation maturing in this time frame, which means that they are in a period of dilution. That said, a multitude of government contracts which are growing in value and number, rapid expansion into the private sector, and one deep ass moat around their technology means that this company isnt going anywhere for the foreseeable future, and actually should be increasing in value far faster than the rate of dilution. Recent earnings were bullish as hell, with all goals met or beat, and 30% YoY guidance reaffirmed. 

In short, my estimation is that the bearish market right now is a blessing in disguise, as I expect this stock to slingshot upwards in value when market conditions permit. From there, I believe it will stabilize at a significantly higher price per share. At that point, long term high returns will most likely continue unless or until guidance is revised to a lower level.

Unlike RKT, UWM‚Äôs revenue does not heavily rely on refi sales and the interest rate. I am not saying rate increase will not impact. It will be minimal compared to other retailers. UWM is a mortgage wholesale company. Their revenue is growing not just because of the historically low interest rate. You are just looking the part of it, not the whole picture.

Biden‚Äôs proposal of long term capital gain increase will demotivate long term investment of non dividends paying companies like alphabet and amazon. Those money can move to real estate.

562,RKT," I refi'd last year and it took 4 months longer than normal because the system was so overwhelmed.  Rates went 1-3% lower than previous years.  That always leads to a boom in refi's (sites below).  In the initial RKT surge last summer, there were a lot of news stories about people refinancing and the high demand.  The issue is that rates can't go lower unless we go to a negative rate like some European countries are testing.  

Who knows what will happen but this industry is 100% dependent on interest rates.  I'd be worried about that risk as an investor, especially with inflation heating up.  One hint of higher rates and all mortgage stocks will selloff like crazy.  If inflation keeps going up, the FED will be forced to raise rates.

By now most of us are familiar with UWMC. The massive 5.75% dividend. Their insanely LOW P/E of about 3.9 and their insane income growth. 4,200% increase in net income! üöÄ (No that‚Äôs not a typo)

So why would any one want to buy this stock right now ?

The CEO is a beast. And not only did they reaffirm their dividend (ex date in June) and just make $860M in the first quarter, they announced the approval of a $300M stock buy back. That‚Äôs big money ! But let‚Äôs dive deeper. The $300M share buy back is of the class A shares that are in the float. $UWMC has a very small float.

104M shares. $300M / $6.70 = 45M. That means at current prices they can buy back nearly 44% of the entire F\*\*kin float. You have never heard of that before and you probably never will again. On earnings call yesterday CEO says ‚ÄúWe can start buying shares tomorrow and I am a buyer at this price !‚Äù

So that leaves 60M shares left in the float. Institutions own 23M of them (I bet it‚Äôs higher) short interest is close to 13M based on latest data.

This just caused the borrow rate to increase by 5X ! new data shows short borrow rates just hit 25%

Apes, there are less than 35M shares freely traded in this stock right now.

On top of all this we still have Russell Inclusion to be announced in June and another blow out 2Q is in the works.

This is NOT financial advice but I can't think of a reason I shouldn‚Äôt park a few dollars in a highly profitable stock, trading at all time lows, paying a 6% dividend with a current p/e under 4?

As an enterprise software company, it's really concerning that they can't turn a profit after all these years.

Software companies should generally have high profit margins because the marginal cost is near zero. Unless their services component is large, which is costly, or have other systemic problems. Their product is not magical and it requires a heavy handed sales component. That's why partnering with IBM makes sense for them.

They are a good, valuable, solid company in some ways, but they just aren't what they claim to be (or what people seem to think they are publicly).

&#x200B;

The reason for their ""extreme integration"" is that they pay teams of data scientists to spend a ton of human hours tearing apart all of the systems of a client and then integrating them. The bit of ""ai"" is just gloss at the end.  


That's fine. They're basically a digital construction company. They build awesome skyscrapers for clients who they bill a lot of money per project.

&#x200B;

BUT, publicly they have everyone believing that they has some magical ""AI software"" that they deploy that simply magically analyzes all of a client's systems and ""radically integrates"" them in a cheap, scalable manner.

If their claims were true, then indeed, Palantir would be a $10 trillion company, no problem.

&#x200B;

But  their REAL business is almost the COMPLETE OPPOSITE of scalable and cheap because they have to 1) draw on the most limited labor pool in the world i.e. data scientists, 2) only hire the best of the best of them, and 3) pay those teams way above market rates to work for them (and they tend to massage this with huge stock awards to the teams).

Reporters would ask: ""So you make money by buying leases and subdividing them?"" and then founder/CEO Neumann would publicly always say, ""No, we're a scalable tech company!!!! We are changing work culture and living culture via proprietary technology!!!!""

&#x200B;

And they ballooned up to a $47 billion valuation before people finally realized the truth: they actually were just leasing property and subdividing leases.

592,AI," That's just sounds like a lot of buzzwords, not trying to roast your explanation but even the airbus article is buzzwordy. I don't know what it means to have data talking together, maybe you can have an aggregated view of many data pipelines? Uses AI to determine the best decision? So the basis of most real world AI is supervised learning. How can the software know the best decision for a scenario without training for it and also can you even train on something so random, you can't generalize decision making for any situation. The hot AI  rn is Machine learning specifically deep learning and it works well for a specialized task or prediction when you have lots of data covering a lot of cases with labeled predictions.

624,MVIS," You clearly have zero understanding of the company and just pulled some talking points from other WSB threads.

MVIS was rising rapidly before WSB came along. It had a 40% day last month which lead to WSB getting involved afterward.

Their revenue for Q3 and Q4 is set to triple or more because their tech is used in microsoft's hololens, which just got a 10 year 20B contract with the Army.

Their lidar was literally just released like 2 weeks ago, and is likely being tested by OEMs right now. Ford owns a solid chunk of MVIS stock.

Institutional ownership is now over 20%. Those companies consist of financial people that are a lot smarter then an idiot such as yourself on reddit.

The stock is shorted just shy of 35 million shares, which is why the price gets hammered until they run out of shares to borrow. Them running out is why the price rocketed last month, without being beaten down the price was able to adjust to actual value.

Share count did not increase. In fact they did an 8x reverse split, meaning 8x less shares available.

Buyout hype began in like October simply because the CEO said the company was for sale. Now that the lidar sample is complete, they are likely in talks pending testing.

716,UWMC," I do agree that ""short squeeze"" is too often thrown about.

I am in UWMC for the value play long-term and saw the price to borrow over tripled in a single day; that had a short squeeze written all over it.

If there are only a few shares to borrow at exorbitant prices, it takes away a tool to push the price down (or at least makes it prohibitively expensive). I see that as a GREAT thing for my long position.

If WSB comes in and scares away the shorts, that's only a short-term bonus for me.

TBH, it is a runaway effect on short covers. Its not like one guy or group doing the shorting, its multiple funds and all in it for profit.

When stock price goes up, borrow costs go up, or there is no more available to short to play with the stock price; one of the funds will cover (profitably).

The other funds either think they can keep pushing it down or they know the cost to borrow will go down (because one fund is no longer borrowing them so they are available) so they stay.

A ""short squeeze"" as we on WBS know it is when all the funds are racing to get out at the same time. If they stagger getting out, we wont even notice the upward price pressure. Or if another fund sees the opportunity and dives in, wont notice.

It is when all the shorts are equally afraid and want to be the first to get out that triggers what WE call a short squeeze. Or something happens to make them afraid (like cost to borrow tripling in hours). 

The reality is that shorts cover EVERY SINGLE DAY it's just most times we don't notice because they do so strategically and in an orderly fashion.

The short squeezes we NOTICE are because those Hedge funds want to fuck each other JUST as bad as they want to fuck us and are racing to see who can get out faster :)",NotThatSpecialToo,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ncghyg/uwmc_short_squeeze_imminent/gy57ptr/,0.06,0.849,0.091,0.849

718,DD," There are two elements driving the case of the silver squeeze.  


1.) This charting explains why silver is massively undervalued relative to M1 and how much it's held down despite rising industrial demand and massive retail demand.  


2.) The other factor is banks have short positions at 92% of the annual global supply.  These banks can't unwind their position easily. They did this while M1 was blowing up and were not paying attention.  


Other DD over on WSS yesterday indicates that COMEX may have run out of silver in the last week. Record outflows from the exchanges abruptly shifted to a net of 19 contracts out of the vault. LBMA admitted overstating their holdings by 3,300 tonnes. Data shows deliveries are drying last week. You can't deliver silver you don't have. üî•üèõÔ∏èüî•

Easy low brainpower play is to buy physical and hold it. Or buy $PSLV.

I‚Äôm guessing for differently yields. 

They are very small and it seems they only stay in Canada unless someone here can prove me wrong. I‚Äôd say give them a lot more time, like opening a few more farms time.

I cheer for Boeing but the unpredictability and constant surprise hurdles make it too hard for me personally to dump money into.

983,SE," $bmbl complete garbage. I've been using this app in conjunction with tinder $mtch for like 5 years.

I've probably paid for like 300 superswipes totaling around a grand in that time frame and received 1/10 the matches I do on Tinder and I only pay tinder $10-20/month and I've been using them for a decade. Lol.  

The only accurate statement you made is that $bmbl incentivizes monetization through women as opposed to through men, which if you think about it, is logically stupid bc men will always be down to pay more for the chance at getting laid.  Bmbl is going against the tide and cultural norms. Women who pay on these types of apps are desperate or slutty.  Not to mention most women, will just swipe which is free. 


I made about $160 back from a class action I just filled out against $bmbl bc they suck so much.  Getting anything over $7 from a class action is like big time they fucked up.  

Their algo is completely backwards.

First, the company has recently announced earnings and proven to Wall Street that they can commercialize and that demand for their product is no issue. They have Pfizer‚Äôs sales team and their own pushing the drug. This is HUGE for uptake. If you check their ER presentation you will get a full hard on, guaranteed.

Second and possibly more important is that there are a lot of catalysts coming up still.

Next week: EMA meets to possibly approve sale of orgovyx in Europe 

June 1: Deadline for FDA approval for a second use case (this could come early and will result in another 100m cash payment from Pfizer)

Part d and Medicare coverage: also supposed to be obtained before July 1 for prostate cancer application 

Pfizer optionality: Pfizer can opt in to have the rights to sell this in some smaller markets, resulting in a 50m cash payment.
