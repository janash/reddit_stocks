15,GME," I normally get mass downvoted for suggesting them on other trading subs.

Sure, if a stock moons massively, you'll probably miss out on a lot of the growth.  But you'll also see far fewer trades closing red or expiring.

I will usually set a trailing stop for 50-90% of my shares position, then manage the remainder of it (+options) manually.  So the GME I bought at $14 mostly closed in the $30-40 range (still 200%+ profit!), but my calls and about 20% of my shares still got to ride the rocket (to >20000% profit).  In the meantime, my SNDL shares sold at around $2.7 without me having to watch them.  Compare to the people who bought GME at $200-300 with no stops, rode it to $500, then back down to $50 and are now staring at >75% losses.

Trailing stops remove that source of emotional error.

Some brokers (e.g. IBKR) allow you to set the trailing amount as a % relative to peak value instead of a fixed about of $.  That can be super useful for avoiding getting closed early by volatility if a stock moons rapidly.",suur-siil,2,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/li4fh8/its_like_magic/gn31jnf/,0.093,0.777,0.131,0.8313

Pump and dump? This is penny stocks. Pump and dumps is literally where we make our money, we're just trying to find them before the pump and dumpers spread too far. If you have a ticker you've done DD on and you see it suddenly getting pumped, you know. If you haven't done DD and you see one getting pumped then do your own DD at that point. If you shut them out completely you lose an advantage. Knowing who your enemy is not is just as important at knowing who your enemy is.

In the short term, SNDL has dipped, and that just means people who wanted to get rich quick are making a run for it. I expect SNDL to dip to around $1.7 per share at the low end of guesswork. If your goal was to cash out in the short term, the train is leaving the building.

If your goal is to hold in the long-term, SNDL is a very strong bet that has benefits that outweigh the risk, assuming you are running a varied portfolio of other pennystocks at any given moment that offset risk overall with benefits.

123,ZSAN," The investigation by a law firm for current long term investors in NASDAQ: ZSAN stocks follows a lawsuit filed against Zosano Pharma Corporation over alleged securities laws violations. The investigation on behalf of current long term investors in NASDAQ: ZSAN stocks, concerns whether certain Zosano Pharma Corporation directors are liable in connection with the allegations made in that lawsuit.

According to that complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California the plaintiff alleges that the Defendants failed to disclose to investorsthat the Company’s clinical results reflected differences in zolmitriptan exposures observed between subjects receiving different lots, that pharmocokinetic studies submitted in connection with the Company’s NDA included patients exhibiting unexpected high plasma concentrations of zolmitriptan, that, as a result of the foregoing differences among patient results, the FDA was reasonably likely to require further studies to support regulatory approval of Qtrypta, that, as a result, regulatory approval of Qtrypta was reasonably likely to be delayed, and that as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.

130,AGTC," Great write-up, this company has huge potential. But I want to summarize my comment from the [first AGTC dd](https://www.reddit.com/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/leusr1/agtc_what_i_havent_seen_anyone_mention/) (it's the top comment) because the hype behind this stock is real, but imo it all hinges on one thing. (For reference I'm a pharma chemist with 12+ years industry experience)

It always comes down to two things; risk and reward. The risk: biotech. Enough said. These go bust or bag-holding farrrr more often than they don't. 

The reward: The huge upside is largely driven by 3 analyst's 12 month projections. The highest ($30) is based  on the rumors of a buyout/merger with Sanofi. I can't remember her name but she's highly connected and qualified, she's absolutely a professional. But it's still speculative. 

My one warning is if the merger rumors fall through, so does the stock.

204,DD," Denison mines has found perhaps the best single uranium deposit in the world. Their Phoenix project at Wheeler River has showed a 19.1% grade uranium sample. For context, between 0,5 and 1 is decent, while anything above 4 is considered great. This means they have the best grade in the world. Adding to that, this uranium is relatively close to the ground, which makes their operating cost an insanely cheap 9 dollars per pound.

Denison mines also bought back $5m of their outstanding shares at 0.91¢.

Personally buying a little today and going to watch to see if we get a pullback or if we just keep climbing. No idea how to calculate a price target for this without completely pulling it out of my ass, but I came from WSB, so moon and rocket-emoji seem appropriate.

$TNXP is the real biomed value play in a sea of PnD

#Who Is $TNXP?

Tonix Pharmaceuticuals IPO’d in 2012 at $40,000. Through offerings and a huge hit in 2016 due to dropping a fibromyalgia treatment in Phase 3, the stock price for **$TNXP** had plummeted to ~$0.50/share by the time COVID lockdown hit the USA on March 14th. By July of 2020, the price had climbed back to $1.50 by July 16th, after a [July 13th common stock offering of $10.5 million](https://www.tonixpharma.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1213/tonix-pharmaceuticals-holding-corp-prices-10500000)

Since July of 2020, **$TNXP** has began trials, reached Phase 3, or put to market over a dozen different treatments, which you can read about in their [often posted Press Releases](https://www.tonixpharma.com/news-events/press-releases?page=4). 

#Who is buying $TNXP?

**$TNXP** has institutional backing from the likes of **Vanguard, Blackrock, Fidelity and** ***more***. They have gotten [27 new institutional owners, a 107.69% change from Q2 2020 - Q3 2020, totaling 69 (*nice*)](http://finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/CompanyInfo/detail.jsp?query=19:0P0000J56I). **Blackrock acquired 1.47 million shares on 09/30/20, GSA Capital acquired 1.06 million MORE shares on 12/31/20, with another 150k shares acquired between Fidelity, Azimut, and more on 01/31/20**. 

I’m no expert, but it sounds like institutions have been finding a lot of interest in this company, and for more than one good reason.

#Why do I see value in $TNXP?

Well, in addition to following well-performing institutions and ETF’s plays, **$TNXP** is making moves on a lot of really fucking promising treatments for a multitude of different ailments. On February 8th, 2021 they [announced that they will be developing the first COVID-19 skin detection test](https://www.tonixpharma.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1246/tonix-pharmaceuticals-to-develop-covid-19-skin-test). The test is aiming to detect COVID-19 as well as T-cell immunity, which other tests are not, by combining three different synthetic peptides, and is similar to Tuberculosis testing. 

They are also developing patents for treating organ rejection and auto-immune disease, has an exclusive licensing for the development of treatment for Prader-Willi syndrome, as well as fibromyalgia &amp;amp; PTSD treatments. 

**$TNXP** has a [total listed assets of $67,617, and only $5,049 of total liability as of Q3 Earnings](https://www.tonixpharma.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1246/tonix-pharmaceuticals-to-develop-covid-19-skin-test) which is an asset increase of +$53,059 from Q2. 

#In conclusion, 

##$TNXP is continuously developing new treatments and patents, including a potentially ground-breaking COVID-19 skin test, as well as vaccine research and more. They have increased assets, decreased liabilities, received huge interest from 5 star rated institutional investors, and has been trending upward all week after a public offering

If you need anymore DD, or have anything to add, or argue, I’m open to discussion. I see a lot of value here, and I think you should too.

I will admit I am new. Yes, GME introduced me to the market. I got in fairly early, recouped my initial investment and have used the profits to diversify my holdings. I actually still hold a couple shares, just for shits and giggles and to remind myself of a couple things. Secure YOUR profits. This isn't a team sport. Don't hold the bag. Just say no to FOMO.

I have a near-useless degree in journalism. The most important tool I got from earning said degree was a sense of doubt of things that I didn't research myself (see: mainstream media). This tool has translated well into personal DD, but the current nature of all of these stock subs has me worried.

We can all agree Reddit is on the internet, yes? So if you're using Reddit, you have internet access at your disposal. Which means, at your disposal, is basically the repository of pretty much all of humankind's knowledge, plus a shit ton of fun memes and porn. When I see folks on these subs asking for DD I get confused. The tool for you to look up exactly what you are asking for is at your immediate disposal. Why not take advantage of it and check things for yourself? The guy posting the DD is selling you the stock. It's been pumped already, he's just selling you a bag.

300,ALL," ATTENTION NOOBS and VETS- I recently jumped into the Penny Stock game and it's been a wild ride. I'm not a tin-hat conspiracy theory type but hear me out...

We've seen the power of Reddit in moving stocks well, WELL, up past their actual (logical) value points only to come crashing back down again. Then they start to climb back up, and crash back down again. This has been happening over and over again. You can look at the 1-6 month charts on hundreds of penny stocks and they look almost identical. Up until 2 months ago most of these stocks were nothing and trading in the .0001-.0010 range. Now suddenly a trial stage bio-pharm company with 2 employees in NJ is trading for $1.50 a share with zero income and zero product? Huh???

As a group, retail investors although large and growing daily, don't have anywhere near the buying power of large hedge funds and brokerage houses. While we may be collectively buying millions of shares in a stock, one trader at a large brokerage may be buying 10's of millions or more themselves. Now multiply that by ALL of the funds and brokerages and you can easily see why we're seeing Volume in the hundreds of millions of shares being traded on a Penny stock. I say again...PENNY STOCK.

Now you and I are hoping and praying our several hundred or several thousand dollar investment blossoms and makes us a lot of money. Sometimes we are vested in a stock but most often we just want to make some money and get out.

However, the fund managers are sharks and are in it for the profit. Period. They have analytical tools and real time monitoring software that we could only wish to use. Not too mention they have insider information (chatter) that we could only dream of hearing.

My point is this, when we're all rushing in to a stock...so are THEY. They are not hoping to see it go to ""To the Moon"" or Mars or anywhere else. They just want to make some money and get out before the dip. So if they buy 20 million shares of a stock and it goes up $1 or $1.50 or even .50...well you do the math. That's $10-30 million dollars and they dip out with their huge volume and sell which causes the price to crash leaving us little folks with often BIG losses.

The FACT of the matter is that there is NO WAY to time the market. There are players and forces in the market that drive it in ways we can never understand. If you're playing for quick profit instead of a long haul then have a strategy. Set a price to get out that you'll be happy with. If that's $100 or $10,000 it doesn't matter because PROFIT is PROFIT. Wouldn't you rather make a $1 a share profit that a $1 a share loss?

Listen I don't have all the answers as I've been burned a few times already playing this game. I don't like to lose money so am sharing my painful lessons with you. Buy in, set an exit strategy, and get out and enjoy the Profit no matter how small or big.

489,RH," Nak is almost completely dependent on the Pebble project, the flagship of the company. However Biden and Alaska senator Murkowski oppose the project. And the outcome of said mine isn't even that strong economically. They did recently appeal the permit denial, so that's something.

Might see some spikes due to the current nature of cheap RH pump and dumps, but like Bombardier, the current outlook is not encouraging.

Obligatory not financial advice, blah blah blah, but if you find some other info, hey, at least it's cheap. Just my personal opinion.

522,DFFN," Diffusion Pharmaceuticals(DFFN)

Diffusion Pharmaceuticals(DFFN) is a company that specializes in therapies to enhance the diffusion of oxygen to tissues with low oxygen levels, today they announced an agreement with H.C. Wainwright & Co. and sold $10 million worth of their common stock to them for $1.025. This caused the price of the stock to drop to around 1.15 from ~1.50. Furthermore because they raised this much money they probably will be using it to develop their oxygen therapies further or already have had a breakthrough in their therapies which caused them to get a large investment. This could lead the stock to go higher than it was previously. I see it as a good long term and short term play and some stock forecast even see the stock going up to 3.50 a potential upside of over 150%. 
Even if it doesn’t reach this 3.50 potential I see it going back to 1.30-1.50 soon

692,DNN," Hey, don't take my word for it, really. I'm just some guy on the Internet with his opinions. Please do check it out the information yourself and see if you agree. I \*do\* think DNN is a good investment, especially at this price, but as a very long-term play. With the first of these types of reactors I've described (keyword search: SMR) hopefully going into production by 2030, it's a loooooooong hold (barring any further government incubation and acceleration like the US Department of Energy has done with TerraPower). With that kind of investment, you have to vet the solvency of the company (not like the trial-phase pharma stocks usually discussed here that typically just do a quick and dirty stock offering to generate operating capital) and I haven't done any research on the basic financials of DNN... though I will! May not hurt to throw three or four hundred dollars at it and forget about it for the next decade.

Excellent point about the Biden administration and a likely acceleration in the reduction of our coal power plant footprint in the US. I don't, however, think the current administration will make much of a dent in the already dramatic reduction of coal consumption in the energy sector here. Not because they \*couldn't\*, but because the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAP) has already been so effective and they basically just need to let it continue to work and push clean energy energy technology, which they will predictably do. So I don't see an acceleration, just a continuation of the reduction, with a caveat. My angle is that it's a good bet against inflation and rising natural gas prices. From a macroeconomic perspective, we've set ourselves up for a what I believe will be significant and quickly realized inflation as life begins to return to normal after the pandemic (of which the acute phase seems to be in retreat). Yields will quickly begin to rise - which they already have done a small amount even this week on positive jobless claims data - a sign that the economy is moving in the right direction. All that to say, the reduction in decommissioning coal power plants per the CSAP is tied to low natural gas prices. Once those begin to rise, the rate at which coal consumption trends down will slow. What's working against this is that natural gas prices (adjusting for inflation) have largely trended sideways for some time regardless of inflation. However, we've put ourselves into a situation with inflation, from a macroeconomic perspective, that we've never been in before, and I believe we will see an increase in energy prices across the board.

The thing about endoxifen is that their phase 2 was like 7 people. Good news for sure, but again, lots more work to be done. 

Like you’re saying here, ATOS isn’t a rocket ship. It could be a good longterm hold. But it’s risky to hold long because all of their drugs are in the pipeline and none are on the market really.

782,AMC, Don’t be afraid to hold. You never lose money if you don’t sell. AMC could be getting bought out by Netflix or Amazon and could make it actually worth something. But as someone else mentioned if your playing with larger amounts of money it’s important to set a stop loss. But the stake are pretty low with the stocks we are talking about so I usually just hold and wait.,drgreenthumb802,3,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/lhznwj/im_super_new_here_i_got_some_great_tips_from_this/gn0copr/,0.084,0.754,0.162,0.6197

850,ACB," Canada at the time had just legalized recreation weed. October 16th, 2018 to be exact. Most companies were starting up around that time. A month later, the Dems took the house but lost 2 seats in the senate. But talks were rolling around about federally decriminalizing weed in America. Many States up to this point had legalized it medically and recreationally. Of course, that didn’t fucking happen and wasn’t expected to happen at the federal level but the momentum sure as fuck did. And then the Weed Companies ran IPO’s but then they realized a few things. Weed also needs to hit earnings. And they need an endless supply of it. Shortage is an issue. Look at ACB. Expected 700,000 kilos a week and only hit the 10% mark. But what did the institutions do? They ran that shit up. Because fuck it, why not? Every ticker was flying high and creating bag holders but the business knew the shortage was there. 

You see momentum in the street and you can run it up. Selling paper to the highest bidder. Holding the bid because Zero Cost Paper always finds a bid. And then you fucking dump it. 

Fast track to now. Momentum is back. And it’s back big and it should be back. Dems took control of DC. So what happens next? You guessed it. The big boys wanna play again. Start running it up and get people to jump. Chasing hanging paper. Bag holders from 2018 probably love it and some may get greedy again but we know one thing for fucking certain. The newbies are gonna buy that garbage up and they are gonna love doing it. And now we have a new generation of bag holders. 

Weed still has a long way to go in the states. There is a very big difference between legalization and decriminalization. This will take time. And will require both state and federal. Things will eventually get moving. Companies will figure out how to deal with things like shortages, licensing, policies and regulations. Shit like dealing with restrictive federal banking laws. Making sure firms won’t just offer up increasing numbers of shares in order to finance planned expansion and in turn creating share dilution, with the individual value of shares falling off a fucking cliff. 

Remember, this sector is still very young. And I have a lot of faith in a lot of companies but we have a lot of doors to break down before we get there. So for now, when Wall Street sees Momentum, it’s time to run it up again. Chase that useless paper and then watch it all flatten out. The support levels are getting higher because there is promise but as long as the retailer is buying, you know the institutions are selling. Because there is always a bid at the top for useless hanging paper.",ignatious__reilly,4,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/lhzp4l/was_tilray_a_pump_and_dump/gn0jkuk/,0.084,0.804,0.112,0.9324

964,GF," I live in DFW so L-MCOL depending on where in DFW with my GF and her kids. Probably popping the question soon. I'd say we're semi frugal. We don't actively penny pinch but neither of us are impulse buyers or anything like that. We see something we want, we save for it etc. I make 50k and 5k bonus at the moment and she makes 35k. Split a house with her parents and we save the extra money for future purchases like a house in the future. my company is expecting to be sold next year which will net me a decent amount  and we agreed already on putting most of that in to something stable in the market instead of blowing it. We both only do 401k match currently. I expect to change jobs post-sell and go to school at Georgia Tech for a 7k masters degree in Comp sci and take advantage of the fast salary jumps in that field to get six figure salaries and all those stock refreshes and bonuses etc. Each salary increase will basically go towards an IRA at this point and also any increase in biweekly transfers to the market

Edit: we plan on having one or two of our own too so I imagine we will need to chill out on aggressive saving and market contributions. We also want to be able to pay for whatever extracurriculars it is that interest them and in good areas known for said extracurriculars should they want to go further than secondary school with it etc so I imagine we will do much better once everyone is out the nest.

Which is a much higher return compared to federal loan interest.

With regards to a house, I may buy the one I'm in now. The owner (family friend) talked about offering it to us for the remaining mortgage amount (about $135k). Its not really a nice house and I don't want to stay here for more then the next 3-5 years, but like you said, it's a real asset. Thus I am heavily considering it.",ReapZZ20,2,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/lhxmgq/how_young_do_you_plan_on_retiring/gn0h80w/,0.093,0.835,0.071,0.01
