60,BIG," Man, looking at that chain is a reminder that ship stuff is big as FUCK!


I used to work at a company that built ginormous diesel engines for ships and also backup generators for nuclear power plants. Every time I walked around the shop floor I was amazed at how fucking huge they were, and some of them, just how *weird* they were.



The biggest engine I've ever seen was a mammoth V12, with pistons the size of trash cans. Maybe not full-on trash cans like you'd take to the dumpster, but roughly the size of the one in your kitchen. I don't want to give super specific details because I don't wanna dox myself or the company, but to give you an idea, the bore was nearly 20 inches in diameter and the stroke was about 2 feet. The engine was over 20 feet tall, and with the turbocharger attached it weighed about half a *million* pounds (not an exaggeration btw, this thing was literally too big to ship via 18-wheeler). The fucking head bolts were the size of my forearms, and I lift weights. Now if you've ever worked on a car's cylinder heads, you know that head bolts are little bitty bitches; you often need to use special wrenches that are shorter than normal to prevent you from overtightening them and breaking them. Those ""little bitty bitch bolts"" on this engine were solid steel over 4 inches in diameter!!! The turbocharger was 6 feet in diameter, and at only 500 RPM the engine made almost as much horsepower as 2 NHRA Top Fuel dragsters at peak power. But instead of doing that for 3.7 seconds, it could produce that power for *months* at a time.


Oh and did I mention that the ship this was going in had 2 of these engines? Ships are fucking BIG man. 



Bonus fact: I mentioned that some of the engines the company made were weird and whoo boy, they were. At first I thought the 9 cylinder engine was tops, (let's be honest, that's pretty fucking strange), but then I found one that was the undisputed heavyweight champion of the world when it came to never, ever getting laid. I'm talking weirder than the kid at your high school who unironically did the Naruto run everywhere he went. This engine was a straight-8, vertically-opposed, 16-piston (instead of one piston per cylinder doing the squishy squishy boom boom action, there were two per cylinder, going up and down towards each other. Yes, this means you need two crankshafts) turbocharged and supercharged, diesel 2-stroke hybrid. It was at least 4 times as tall as it was wide, and I have no idea how the fuck that thing ran but somehow it did.

Did you know they've been profiting as the stock goes up and been profiting as the stock goes down? Each and every time.

Did you know that retail investors don't have the capacity or analyse and trade the market as quickly as hedge funds? 

For example, a lot of retail investors can't trade in the after hours or pre-market. Many who can trade have restrictions on the hours they can trade (unlike hedge funds)?

That means they trade from 4AM to 8PM - 16hrs. Most retail investors trade 9:30AM to 4:30PM - 7 hrs. 

Who do you think has the advantage? 

Some retail traders have been doing well on GME. They are visible and post about it.

Most retail traders have either been losing money or missing profits which institutional traders are getting.

Look at the industry. Look at the trends. Look at what makes the company vulnerable, ask how are the leaders going to mitigate those vulnerabilities?

You have too much faith on a rebound, maybe the American people are immune to mental health issues?

You assume all theatres open immediately and AMC can prolong death until they do?

Even if just 5% of the population developed a 50% reduction in Amenities consumption based engagement with the economy... they're going to choose to not do things which require the most engagement with the sources of those anxieties.

Sitting. Next. To. Strangers.

AMC was **already** vulnerable *before* Pandemic. That's why it was a candidate for being shorted. That short position is now tiny. The float means that squeezing isn't possible.

So a 2.5% (that's conservative) hit to revenue for the next few years before we even consider the ripple effect of that, (kids inheriting behaviours... etc.)

More screens have been built year on year in the US... with revenue from tickets falling year on year. This identifies an emerging inefficiencies... or someone is understanding this and going to undermine the traditional theatres (AMC) by operating lower cost screens. AMC was slow to adapt to the pandemic, which they had months to prepare for. Imagine how they've not prepared for industry shift that has been occurring for years? Because I can't find anything they're doing.

And let's not mention the looming threat of home movie theatres... that's already a $7bn industry and growing. Traditional theatres are only a $20bn industry themselves... and stagnating.

AMC has no new tech. No acquisitions. No mergers. No strategy to deal with changing market demands. No new leadership. No way to mitigate rising costs of running theatres. No strategy to get NEW people watching movies.

They took a $400m line of credit because they have to. They diluted $500m of your shares because they had to. They took a $3.5m bonus for themselves because they wanted to.

You will make money with the dividend.
The contract is deep ITM and you think the price offered for the contracts are too low.

I have seen in this thread another reason that make sense for the current situation with GME, which is to exercice to help the squeeze.

329,GME," Depending on expiry date, if it comes and goes and never hit strike price you keep premium and you will will have your shares. The speculator that bought the contract (another person or simply MM) is out their premium fee they paid.

They could possibly sell it if it still has value. That doesn't release you out of the contract. Not until the expiry date is reached or you buy back the contract to close.

Let's say you wrote a 2 year calls on GME. You got it filled and a premium paid. You still own the shares but they can be called away at any time up to and including that date. Let's say the price shoots up to $150/sh. The value of that contract just rose tremendously. The paltry premium that was nice at the time ain't even a down-payment to buy back those contracts to close. If you're long on the stock anyways , you may not care. I still believe in GME so if no one exercises then I still have the shares. If the shares fall way back down, and they will, I can buy back my contract like I originally planned for a small profit. If they get called away, oh well im paid my strike price and realize a profit but way smaller than I could have by selling right now.

&#x200B;

I like the stock in the long term and GME has very real potential to be a heavy hitter in the gaming industry under the right direction of leadership that knows what it wants and can execute. GameStop is in a great position for it too.

&#x200B;

Again I say this, no matter what happens. GME will be in an organic bullcycle come late March with a new CEO, surprise news and good earnings. The price is going to be going up anyways, no matter what happens.

&#x200B;

As far as the price goes? We have held to get it where it is now and if we squeeze. We can hold to get 100k a share too. I will try and hold until it reaches that height. Remember, we have been through the worse on bad days, I'm not even phased anymore. Holding while it goes up should be easy for 100k. If they are indeed returning many massive amount of shares, just relax. The squeeze will last for a little bit with a lot of halts, I mean a hell of a lot.

&#x200B;

The same grit and grind that got us to where we are now with the price, along with the solid fundamentals from DFV has already been proven that it 100% works. It also really is something too. I can't really put into words and articulate the sentiment that is needed. What I can say though is that we retail, saved two companies from going under. No matter what happens, that is something to be proud about and something you can tell your loved ones down the road. You helped save companies and jobs that people not only needed, but some wanted to keep.

We can get to 100k by doing the same thing we have been doing all along, just holding beybei.

I recently read A Man For All Markets by Edward Thorpe and it's absolutely a great read.  He touches on a ton of information that's relevant right now with GME.  From the Efficient Market Hypothesis (which GME clearly proves isn't real), the wisdom of crowds, a proper way to hedge, the housing crisis and Bernie Madoff's ponzi scheme to Citadel and Ken Griffin.

405,AI," Well, at a glance I saw one post claiming that the GME squeeze will take days or weeks so people shouldn’t worry about missing it. There’s absolutely no evidence or way to predict how long a squeeze will last. Even the “days to cover” which is around 2 btw, is an estimate based on shorted shares and daily volume.

Another is claiming 500k is not a meme and that some bs DD or AI model proves it. Again, no such thing can be proven or predicted. I’m too lazy to do a full calculation, but 500k a share is probably more than the USA’s GDP. There is no way more money that exists in circulation is going to be paid out, no matter the price. At some point the SEC or government would step in, or everyone who owes money would simply go bankrupt and leave their debts unpaid. You can’t squeeze a stone.

That’s not to say that I don’t believe in GME. I’m holding as well, and I hope to get rich too. But the stuff they’re saying in that sub is out of tune with reality.

413,GDP," See, this is the kind of retardation that's dangerous. The government is not going to bail out plebs. They have no reason to. It's not even like you lost money, it's money you never had. The reason they bailed out the banks in '08 was to prevent the financial system from collapsing. If the system looks like it's going to collapse again, you can bet your ass that government intervention will not be in your favor. If anything, they will protect the market makers to prevent a collapse.

415,GME," I get your point for sure. Definitely better to take whatever you can and gtfo rather than baghold.

But all the memes aside, I think 1K is very low cause Melvin under oath has testified that shorts haven't even started covering. The first squeeze in January was solely gamma and I'm certain it would have touched 1K had Robinhood and other brokerages not come together to fuck us. 

With how high GME is, and keeps rising to (pre-short squeeze), how shorts keep doubling down, how massive whales and other institutions have smelled blood and joined in, 10K is my personal lowball.

I own just 6.5 and plan on selling the first 1.5 at 10K then riding the rest out.

534,GME," Options explained for retards, like myself just figuring them out:

An option is a contract where two people agree that you can buy or sell 100 shares at a particular price. In a *Call* option, Alice makes a deal with Bob that should X stock be at Y price before Z date, Alice may purchase shares from Bob at that price. Bob agrees to this by taking a premium from Alice - this is basically a wager. Alice thinks the price of the stock will go above the price they agree on, so that Alice can buy stock from Bob and then turn around and sell it on the open market for $$$. Bob is betting that the price doesn't rise above the price they agree upon and that Alice won't *Exercise* her contract - so Bob keeps his shares, Bob keeps the premium Alice paid.

(That agreed upon price? We call it the *Strike Price*.)

There is also the *Put* option. Entering this contract, Carl agrees with David that should X stock be at Y price before Z date, Carl may sell 100 shares to David at an agreed upon price. We're looking at the inverse of the situation. Carl thinks the price of the stock on the open market is going to fall below their Carl and David's strike price; David thinks it'll stay above that price. Should Carl be right, David must buy shares from Carl above the going market price -- this means Carl can just buy 100 stocks on the open market, and then sell them for a profit to David immediately. But should David be right, Carl would be better off selling any stock he does hold (if any! He may have entered this deal at 0 hoping to do what is in the previous sentence) to the open market rather than to David because David would give less money than the open market. In this case, David is the one collecting the premium payment.

Now, that's all fine and dandy. It's ~~better~~ betting in either direction that the strike price you agree upon will be less or more than the going market rate by some date in the future.

What I only just learned recently is that there is a ""secondary"" market for options where you can trade these options! That is, a deal where Alice and Bob have a contract, Alice can turn to Edward and ask Edward to take her place in the contract. Edward ""buys"" Alice out of the contract with a premium payment, and now Edward and Bob are in the contract together. If Alice paid a $300 premium to Bob to enter the contract, but Edward is willing to pay $500 to be in this contract with Bob, Alice can sell the contract to Edward for +$200 gains.

To breakdown OP's screenshot: OP has purchased a $65 Call option that is to be exercised on (or before*) March 19. How do I know it's a $65 call option? Because one contract = 100 shares; the average cost per share (""Avg Cost"" in right column) is $4.40, which means OP paid $4.40 in premium for each share. (Because a contract is 100 shares, it cost OP $440 total to enter this contract.) To make a profit, the going rate of the GME stock must exceed the Strike Price + Premium. So, Strike + Premium = Breakeven. Little Algebra, Strike + $4.40 = $69.40, so the Strike was $65.

^(*I mention the option to trade before. I can't tell how you know before hand, but there are two styles to a contract dubbed American and European style. American may exercise before the agreed upon date, while European can only exercise the contract on that date. So American has more leeway for profits because any day between now and the expiration date may have some spike or dip that goes in the favor of the person who paid the premium, and thus the premium is more expensive usually. I don't know if each trading platform uses one style for all options, or if the person who creates the contract to sell - and gets the first premium - can dictate what style of contract they'd like.)

Right now, should OP Exercise his option, he buys from someone we'll call Xavier for $65 and can immediately trade it on the open market for $138.30. Looking at $73.30 of profit (minus the premium, so really closer to $68.90 of profit in the big picture) per share. That $73.18 in OP's picture means that there are people willing to pay a premium to OP to have OP exit the contract and let them take OP's place with the contract to Xavier. That is, someone else on the market wants to pay $73.18/share in the contract to OP so that they can buy GME from Xavier for $65.

OP may sell this contract and make $7,318 in premium. And OP would wash his hands clean of this deal. OP paid $440 to get the contract in the first place, so he'd make $6878 of profit for buying the contract and then selling it. Never exercising it. That's what RH means by ""Total Return"" -- it's gains not yet realized on the secondary market. (Same as if I bought GME at $100 x 100 shares for $10,000, and my total return would be $3,830 with the current selling price of $138.30, that I have not yet realized because I have not sold my shares.) The ""Today's Return"" of $268.00 means on that trading day, the price people were willing to pay for his contract went up $268; the day previous it was $7,050, but now it's $7,318.

536,GME," All of these explanations are retardedly long.

You bought 1 call option, which has 100 shares, at $4.40 per share. So that $4.40 x 100 = $440 total you paid for the contract.

Your break-even price is the above amount (“limit price”) you paid plus the strike price. That’s the $4.40 + $65 = $69.40. Any stock price for GME above this and you’re in the money. At exactly $69.40 and you made/lost $0 net.

The strike price is the price where you’re entitled to buy the 100 shares, if you execute the  option.

If you execute, then you’d buy 100 shares x $65 per share = $6,500. You now have 100 GME shares that you paid $6,500 for at a discount.

But current share value of GME is $138.30. So your 100 shares are actually worth $13,830 in GME, which you bought for only $440 plus $6,500.

(This is assuming you exercise the contract and sell at the $138.30 stock price. Keep in mind your option contract expires on 3/19 and you’ll lose the ability to execute then.)",NotMSUPD,22,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lzp7n5/i_accidentally_bought_an_option_what_do_these/gq46req/,0.03,0.83,0.14,0.9485

You should stick to buy call or up options.  You're loss is only as large as the up front premium you paid for the options contracts.  You can sell your bought options contracts if they are ITM (In the money) for profit.  Or, you can watch your contracts expire out of the money and lose your premium.  Don't be greedy, have an exit plan to sell of options contracts ITM.  I made a mistake a couple weeks ago when GME jumped to just under 200 and held some huge gain options too long.

545,GME," Its not as complicated as it seems, but here is a simplified answer of why a call option has value (there are more complicated answers but this should hopefully give a simple idea.

One option is bundled as the same buying power as 100 shares.  A call option is the OPTION to buy shares in the future below the trading price.  

Say there is a $20 stock and it rises to $25.  100 shares going up $5 would be worth $500.  In a normal world using shares, you would have paid $2,000 for the shares, sold for $2,500 to make that $500.  So to get in the game, you’d need $2,000.
 
But say back at $20, you bought a call option for $25.  Depending on the stock, you could get in cheap for 1 call.  Say that call cost $75.  That call has no “real”value at that point, but say the stock jumps to $30.  That $75 call is now effectively access to buying 100 shares at $25.  So how much would someone being willing to pay for access to that opportunity?  Not more than the profit they’d make in the transaction (in this case, buy in $2500 and sell at $3000 for $500).  But someone might be willing to buy that option for $400 knowing it is already in the money.  So your $75 turned into $400 and got near 4x return.   

Where you see the crazy gains is that scenario (say $25 call) but actual stock went full retard to $100.  Now buying that call gives some access to $7500 of profit ($10,000 - $2500) and they’d pay you $7000 for that call.

Boom, you just turned $75 into $7000.  Stock went 4x in price, your option went up 100x.

But of course, situations like that are rare but when stocks like GME are gaining like mad, crazy gains can be had.",A_Rising_Wind,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lzp7n5/i_accidentally_bought_an_option_what_do_these/gq433p2/,0.058,0.772,0.17,0.9908
546,GME," Can you elaborate on what you mean? I assume by straddle, you mean try playing both a call and a put?

Really the premium is what holds you back, and just how far apart your options are. Imagine the price of GME is $100. You can buy a call option for $150, meaning if it trades above $150 you can exercise your contract to pay $15,000 to your contract buddy and then sell on the open market for profits. Because you can't predict the future, you also buy a put option for $50, meaning if it trades below $50 you can exercise your contract to sell 100 shares of GME for $5000, netting any profit from getting your 100 shares on the open market for less than that.

But you paid two premiums. And what happens if GME's volatility isn't enough to bring it above $150 or below $50? Both your options are worthless, and you're out the money. And really you need the market price of GME to be far enough above or below either strike price to make up for the money you paid on the premiums.

Edit: Hypothetically, if your expiration dates were right or you could exercise prior to expiration date, you could exercise both with enough volatility - high highs and low lows. But the problem is the closer the trading price is to your strike price when trading, the more likely it seems the price will get above or below your strike price (in the buyer's favor), such that the premium is much more, setting the breakeven price much further away from current trading price.

Edit 2: I'm learning some lingo! Straddle is actually not what I described an OP affirmed they meant. That is called a *Strangle* - buying a call and a put at different prices (where the call's strike price is higher than the put's). Instead, a straddle is actually when you buy both the call and put at the same strike price. The real straddle could be profitable for you, let's say GME is at $135 and we straddle at $135 for 2 weeks from now (3/19). If the price is $150 on 3/19, we can exercise our call to buy at $135 and sell at $150 for $15/share profit; if the price is $100, we can buy shares at $100 and exercise our put to sell at $135 for $35/share profit. The problem is going to be premiums on opening such a straddle position will be really big; if the combined premium is over $35/share, then neither of those price points will be enough for us to cover the premium in profits. You'd need to see GME even lower or much higher.",Exaskryz,35,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lzp7n5/i_accidentally_bought_an_option_what_do_these/gq3z2f7/,0.05,0.893,0.057,0.8091
547,GME," Maybe. The person who opens the contract usually has the shares on hand, a covered call as it were. So Bob in this hypothetical may have 1000 GME shares, and was willing to bet 100 of them in 1 contract with OP to try to collect OP's $440. Bob misses out on opportunity cost.

But a naked call exists where Bob doesn't have 100 shares. If OP exercises, Bob must buy the 100 shares to give to OP. I don't think Robinhood allows a retailer to open a naked call, because the going price to buy the shares for Bob to then give to Alice (or Edward) can be huge.",Exaskryz,7,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lzp7n5/i_accidentally_bought_an_option_what_do_these/gq45yit/,0.016,0.818,0.166,0.9371
548,GME," Right, this is an older contract, hence OP's profits. At the time of purchase, it didn't seem all that likely that GME would get back up to $65 by 3/19; but now, we know it is, and so the premium on it soared from $4.40/share ($440/contract) to over $73/share (over $7300/contract). The profit someone can make on buying this contract now and exercising it is like $12, but with how volatile the stock is, by the time they do get to sell the shares they just collected maybe the price drops and now they have to wait for the market price to come back up to turn a profit.",Exaskryz,8,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lzp7n5/i_accidentally_bought_an_option_what_do_these/gq404ln/,0.0,0.868,0.132,0.9403
549,GME," Just the premium. $440 is correct.

Everything else is unrealized. His gains are potentially unlimited if GME stock price went to ∞, but he has to exercise the contract and then sell the stock on the market to get that profit. Or he can just sell this option for whatever people will pay him.

If GME took a nose dive and value dropped 75%, OP wouldn't lose any more money. But OP would not exercise his $65 call when they can get it for $45. And the market for selling the contract to someone else will be much cheaper, the premium OP can collect would be far less than the $7300 now - probably much closer to the $440 he paid.",Exaskryz,9,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lzp7n5/i_accidentally_bought_an_option_what_do_these/gq454jy/,0.013,0.897,0.091,0.8731
550,GME," The question is, why exercise at a loss?

Let's take OP's GME price in the screenshot of $138.30. I have an option of my own called a $150 call (you'll see that around wsb as a 150c). This means I can pay someone $150 per share, x100 shares, or $15,000 to buy GME.

But the open market would let me have 100 shares at $13,800. Why would I pay my contract guy $1,200 more than a random person on the open market? It's better to just let the contract be worthless and be out the premium, instead of paying more!

Now, of course, the choice is there to do both. Buy $13,800 worth of GME, and if the price of GME gets to $200 before my options contract expires, I can then exercise that contract to pay $15,000 more of GME. And now I'd have 200 shares (100+100) to sell at $200 each, for $40,000. And the cost of it all was $13,800 from open market, $15,000 from exercised option = $28,800, plus whatever premium I paid to get the option in the first place. $40,000 - that cost is my profit.

Edit:

>In that case does the person who is selling the stock get paid the premium and the strike price?

Basically, yes. If I'm Alice who paid Bob a premium to open this hypothetical $150 call on GME, Bob got my premium and exercising the contract means Bob gets $15,000 selling me 100 GME shares. (It is possible that I'm Edward instead, and Bob collected Alice's premium, but collects my $15,000. Alice got my premium that I paid her to take her place in the contract.)",Exaskryz,21,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lzp7n5/i_accidentally_bought_an_option_what_do_these/gq3qt4f/,0.031,0.911,0.058,0.7637
551,GME," Kind of.

So the easiest to understand trading is you buy a share, you can sell a share. If the selling price of your share is higher than what you bought, you get that profit.

Usually when people talk about shorts, they mean short selling the stock. That is they borrow the stock from someone, promising to pay them back - and often pay interest in the meantime to who they borrow from - and they do as they please with the stock. Normally that is sell it ASAP on the open market, and then when the price falls, buy back the stock and return it to the original owner. So the shorter pockets the difference in prices, which they want to be a profit, of course.

But as in the comment above, we're talking about options, which are contracts to buy or sell at a predetermined price. I guess there are ways to short options, like shorting stocks, but I'm still too smooth brained to understand it all. And there's even further options trading beyond the call/put options. (Fidelity mentions something about 5 levels of options tradings in their app when you apply for options to be available on your brokerage account.)

To get to your question, at least how I understand it: A Call option is kind of the reverse short, because you as the purchaser of the call option want the trading price of the underlying stock to go up. While short sellers want it to go down. But there are also Put options which want the price to go down as well; because you agree with someone to sell at a certain price and you hope it trades below that. So you could look at it as a Put option reverses the order of buy/sale for the profiteer compared to a short seller. The short seller first sells stock (that they borrowed) and later buys stock (to replace what they borrowed). The Put exerciser buys stock on the market and then sells it at the agreed upon price.

(To further complicate things: I can already have my stock on hand, and open a put position. But why would I not just sell my stock on the open market? Well, because my stock is volatile. If I have 100 GME that I bought at $100 each, it is trading at $140, and someone is offering to guarantee buying it from me for for $110, I have a ""safety net"" of selling my GME for a $10 profit/share  - minus the premium I paid them to put in place this safety net. If GME tanks and falls back to $40, I can still sell the GME I have on hand for $110. From there, I can decide GME is not worth trying to ride to the moon, walking away. Or I can reload and buy up a new batch of 100 GME. But should GME shoot up, my put will expire worthless, but I have the stock anyway to sell at the market price and profit off it.)",Exaskryz,5,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lzp7n5/i_accidentally_bought_an_option_what_do_these/gq4atmu/,0.022,0.852,0.126,0.9928

Let's say you bought at $120. Would selling at $300+ been great? Sure.

553,GME," Options explained for retards, like myself just figuring them out: An option is a contract where two people agree that you can buy or sell 100 shares at a particular price. In a *Call* option, Alice makes a deal with Bob that should X stock be at Y price before Z date, Alice may purchase shares from Bob at that price. Bob agrees to this by taking a premium from Alice - this is basically a wager. Alice thinks the price of the stock will go above the price they agree on, so that Alice can buy stock from Bob and then turn around and sell it on the open market for $$$. Bob is betting that the price doesn't rise above the price they agree upon and that Alice won't *Exercise* her contract - so Bob keeps his shares, Bob keeps the premium Alice paid. (That agreed upon price? We call it the *Strike Price*.) There is also the *Put* option. Entering this contract, Carl agrees with David that should X stock be at Y price before Z date, Carl may sell 100 shares to David at an agreed upon price. We're looking at the inverse of the situation. Carl thinks the price of the stock on the open market is going to fall below their Carl and David's strike price; David thinks it'll stay above that price. Should Carl be right, David must buy shares from Carl above the going market price -- this means Carl can just buy 100 stocks on the open market, and then sell them for a profit to David immediately. But should David be right, Carl would be better off selling any stock he does hold (if any! He may have entered this deal at 0 hoping to do what is in the previous sentence) to the open market rather than to David because David would give less money than the open market. In this case, David is the one collecting the premium payment. Now, that's all fine and dandy. It's ~~better~~ betting in either direction that the strike price you agree upon will be less or more than the going market rate by some date in the future. What I only just learned recently is that there is a ""secondary"" market for options where you can trade these options! That is, a deal where Alice and Bob have a contract, Alice can turn to Edward and ask Edward to take her place in the contract. Edward ""buys"" Alice out of the contract with a premium payment, and now Edward and Bob are in the contract together. If Alice paid a $300 premium to Bob to enter the contract, but Edward is willing to pay $500 to be in this contract with Bob, Alice can sell the contract to Edward for +$200 gains. To breakdown OP's screenshot: OP has purchased a $65 Call option that is to be exercised on (or before\*) March 19. How do I know it's a $65 call option? Because one contract = 100 shares; the average cost per share (""Avg Cost"" in right column) is $4.40, which means OP paid $4.40 in premium for each share. (Because a contract is 100 shares, it cost OP $440 total to enter this contract.) To make a profit, the going rate of the GME stock must exceed the Strike Price + Premium. So, Strike + Premium = Breakeven. Little Algebra, Strike + $4.40 = $69.40, so the Strike was $65. ^(*I mention the option to trade before. I can't tell how you know before hand, but there are two styles to a contract dubbed American and European style. American may exercise before the agreed upon date, while European can only exercise the contract on that date. So American has more leeway for profits because any day between now and the expiration date may have some spike or dip that goes in the favor of the person who paid the premium, and thus the premium is more expensive usually. I don't know if each trading platform uses one style for all options, or if the person who creates the contract to sell - and gets the first premium - can dictate what style of contract they'd like.) Right now, should OP Exercise his option, he buys from someone we'll call Xavier for $65 and can immediately trade it on the open market for $138.30. Looking at $73.30 of profit (minus the premium, so really closer to $68.90 of profit in the big picture) per share. That $73.18 in OP's picture means that there are people willing to pay a premium to OP to have OP exit the contract and let them take OP's place with the contract to Xavier. That is, someone else on the market wants to pay $73.18/share in the contract to OP so that they can buy GME from Xavier for $65. OP may sell this contract and make $7,318 in premium. And OP would wash his hands clean of this deal. OP paid $440 to get the contract in the first place, so he'd make $6878 of profit for buying the contract and then selling it. Never exercising it. That's what RH means by ""Total Return"" -- it's gains not yet realized on the secondary market.

The ""Today's Return"" of $268.00 means on that trading day, the price people were willing to pay for his contract went up $268; the day previous it was $7,050, but now it's $7,318.

558,GME," That's a fine perspective to hold, at least to never be the one trying to write a contract. Usually what you're looking at is someone trying to rake in some premiums over time by going into these contracts. If I have 1000 GME, I could write out 10 contracts, gambling it on premiums. If all those premiums were more expensive than my cost in obtaining the GME, even if I lose, I still made profit. Yes, I could have made much more profit just selling the GME on the open market, but I'm taking the chance that these contracts are not exercised. By not being exercised, I just made practically free money, where I now have premiums and now GME. And if I did this enough times and high enough a price, my GME was essentially free. It may be a slower build of profit over time, but it can be nice.

A lot of people here treat the market as a get rich quick scheme. The professionals see it as a way to make fairly steady money. They don't really mind if they failed to realize $1,000,000 in selling 1000 GME, so long as they actually profited off the premiums that came from it (over possibly multiple contracts).",Exaskryz,7,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lzp7n5/i_accidentally_bought_an_option_what_do_these/gq48agt/,0.028,0.804,0.168,0.9837

561,GME," So options have a limited risk. There's a premium which is predetermined. Then all you are agreeing to is buying or selling at a certain price, no more, no less. The only ""loss"" someone sustains is the opportunity cost of buying cheaper or selling higher, or the premium.

But the unlimited risk is short selling. This is where Jack asks Kevin to borrow N number of shares from Kevin. Kevin agrees by charging an interest rate (and maybe a premium too?) to Jack, then Jack turns around and sells them on the market. Jack makes money. But he owes Kevin shares, and the longer he doesn't pay Kevin back, the more interest he owes Kevin. 

Here's where unlimited loss comes into play for Jack: If Kevin decides he wants to sell his shares now on the open market, Kevin can force Jack to give the shares back. Jack must buy the shares on the open market to give the shares to Kevin. Jack makes money if earlier he was able to sell the shares to open market for more than he purchases them for. Jack loses money if the price he must buy them for is more than what he sold, and that price he must buy them for is theoretically unlimited. Imagine Kevin sees the price of GME is $69,420 per share. If Jack had borrowed 1000 shares from Kevin, Jack must pony up $69,420,000 to buy the shares and give them to Kevin to then sell on the open market (or just shortcut it and pay Kevin the $69,420,000 that Kevin would get on the open market if Jack can't actually obtain the shares directly.)

Jack short sells in the hopes the price is going down. The best outcome is if the shares he borrowed become worthless, which means he owes Kevin nothing and their deal is ended. This happens when the company for those stocks goes bankrupt. Apparently the cherry on top is that Jack doesn't have to pay any taxes on the money he got when he first sold them to the open market. So it's really great if the company goes bankrupt for Jack.",Exaskryz,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lzp7n5/i_accidentally_bought_an_option_what_do_these/gq3y9v1/,0.063,0.783,0.154,0.9819

564,GME," It is $7318 as in his screenshot. That would be the +premium on his ledger. But his net outcome is the premium he earned minus the premium he paid in the first place of $440, so you get the $6878 gains.

>How does the premium for the contract alone rise in price enough so that it's worth it? Something to do with Theta? IV? 

No idea on Theta tbh. IV I thought was just a measure of volatility, so not necessarily related, but probably factored in (or volatility and the premiums are determined from things like delta and gamma). 

The premium on the contract rises with the price of the underlying stock. When GME went past $65 and beyond, the premiums for the contract went up a lot - otherwise it would be easy money for anyone to buy the contract off OP. It's to the point where selling the contract or attempting to exercise it + sell the stock is worth it to OP.

Note, OP does *not* have to sell his stock after exercising. If he thinks GME is going to hit $10000 by April, he can exercise his contract for 100 GME shares by 3/19 for $65 each and then hold on for the rest of the ride.",Exaskryz,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lzp7n5/i_accidentally_bought_an_option_what_do_these/gq4ms29/,0.014,0.897,0.089,0.9474

Text of the Advance Notice

(a)

The advance notice of National Securities Clearing Corporation (“NSCC”) is

annexed hereto as Exhibit 5 and consists of modifications to Rule 4(A) (Supplemental Liquidity

Deposits) of the NSCC’s Rules & Procedures (“Rules”) to (1) calculate and collect, when

applicable, supplemental liquidity deposits to NSCC’s Clearing Fund (“Supplemental Liquidity

Deposits,” or “SLD”) on a daily basis, rather than only in advance of the monthly expiration of

**stock options** (defined in Rule 4(A) as “Options Expiration Activity Period”); (2) establish an

intraday SLD obligation that would apply in advance of **Options Expiration Activity Periods** and

may also be applied on other days, as needed; (3) implement an alternative pro rata calculation of

Members’ SLD obligations that may apply in certain circumstances; and (4) simplify and

improve the transparency of the description of the calculation, collection and treatment of SLD

in Rule 4(A) of the Rules, as described in greater detail below. 1

**Edit:** as pointed out by u/CraigWesleySF in a comment below, I'm actually misinterpreting this based on lack of knowledge/context.  
SLD is calculated based on options, but IT DOES extend to all risk, whether it is the underlying or a derivative. So game fucking on.",Basting_Rootwalla,37,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lzllyx/dtcc_document_posing_new_rules/gq3l163/,0.031,0.92,0.049,0.3392

596,GME," Look man my position is 10.5 shares @ $48 and I've been holding for over 2 months now, I'm by no means a shill but 100k is absolutely a meme. Multiple brokers shut off buying before it could hit 500, all kind of illegal, shady shit has happened to quell this squeeze and more will continue to happen. Realistically I'm setting my expectations to top out somewhere between 600-1000 personally. I still believe it's a great long term play and this stock could be anywhere from 200-500 within a year or two. That said, if anyone's goal is some nice short term gains, do not hold till 100k. I'm sure a lot of us wish we had sold on jan 28th and got back in 2 weeks later when it was trading around 50 - I think the best play is to catch the squeeze that looks like it will happen this month, cash out with some big profit, and get back in when it drops to hold long term because we all like this stock. I think most of us are here to make money, but perpetuating ""100k is not a meme"" is going to leave a lot of people here waiting for that day and never seeing it. I'm not trying to introduce doubt to anyone or convince anyone to paper hands, but the spirit of this sub is to get gains and personally I believe the best way to get those gains is to cash out on this next big squeeze, even if it only goes to 500. The stock will drop considerably after it squeezes and that would be the time to re-enter and hold while daddy Cohen turns GME into the powerhouse we know he can. Hell, there may even be more squeezes after this next one, and cashing out at the top of each squeeze while reentering after it drops every time could be some serious gains and that's what the hell we are here for",ChanoMeetGW,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lzllyx/dtcc_document_posing_new_rules/gq4i0hc/,0.086,0.742,0.172,0.9857

With enough moves, ladder attacks, they can even regain their ITM, lowering the stock price.  But now, DTCC wants the shorters to cough up the shares/money on the day of.  No more fake numbers that influences the actual stock value.  This is a way to make sure these short squeezes don't happen by not allowing for severe short tactics to go out of hand.  A few billion loss doesn't hurt, but what the GME shorters are doing is going to cost trillions.  The more the shorters postpone settling their shorts, the more it costs the brokers and investors of these hedge funds.  Most being pension owners with 401k.

598,GME," There are multiple avenues through which the NSCC acquires its liquidity from. This type of liquidity deposit which this rule change addresses is specific to supplemental liquidity providers, which are typically market makers. This change also redefines how they designate members as SLP's. From what I can gather, any time a member whose daily balance of pending trade value is the highest among all other members, they receive that SLP designation. That designation sticks for 2 years and every time it happens the clock resets. They also limit the number of SLP designations at 30 (NSCC has over 3000 members). Now, did RH ever meet that definition over the last 2 years? Without looking at the NSCC's books, we can't say for sure. If they did, it probably would have been triggered at the peak of the GME/memestock rally. Considering how large citadel is, and that they were likely processing tons of GME related volume on those days, I find it unlikely that RH ever surpassed Citadel to take the daily SLP crown. This is pure speculation, but I think that what happened here is that citadel at one point had a default risk that exceeded the total value of the NSCC's entire liquid assets. If citadel defaulted, then NSCC and the entire market goes Kablooie. The NSCC came knocking at Citadel to ask for the difference, but citadel told them to go fuck themselves because the rules at the time said that they didn't have to.  Under old rules the monthly liquidity need for SLP's would have been last calculated on Jan 11th and the next date that SLP's were due to make further liquidity payments wasn't until February 17th.  So what is the NSCC to do?? They cant wait that long, their risk is too high right now. Well, the rules had a stipulation that they can collect special liquidity needs from other members on any given business day between those calculation dates, if they determine that that member's increased activity is the primary reason for the NSCC's increased liquidity need. Hence, they come to RH and the other brokers that are generating lots of memestonk volume and shake them down. Could Citadel have seen this coming and used it to their advantage to perfectly time initiating shorts at the top of the GME rally to coincide with when NSCC would be forced to perform liquidity calls on brokers which would then have to restrict buying? Considering the massive amount of volume that Citadel handles, their inside knowledge of how these rules worked, and their data crunching capability, I wouldn't put it past them. It definitely looks to me like the NSCC and it's members were listed that this happened though and that these changes are designed to put the onus on the largest members to be responsible in scenarios like this. Another takeaway I have is that it appears that the NSCC's risk management only covers the need to settle the default of any single member. Even with the new rules, if multiple small/medium members default in a single day, or if the largest member plus a couple smaller members default in a single day, then they will be scrambling to come up with the liquidity from smaller members and could collapse.

Im not sure how this really effects GME because one would assume citadel has enough money for the SLD, but it also shows that the NSCC thinks members firms are probably carrying liquidity risk and have “dun fucked up.” The founder of Interactive Brokers, which is huge in the retail professional world traders, has been in CNBC and Bloomberg saying how people don’t really know how close to a market collapse last month, just his opinion, and he was actually proposing just reporting short interest daily to fix the problem.

Depending on when this rule is implimented, GME either is going to rocket or just be on cruise control till then.  March 19 is the last day of many expiration of derivatives of stock index futures, stock index options, stock options, and single stock futures expire simultaneously.  This in theory could destroy the market if the shorters have push their delays since Feb. GME could go to $100k, but unlikely due to the rules allowing brokers to stop all sales.

I also agree that ""this is a good sign"" is merely conjecture. It is not a guarantee or signal of the whole MOASS, but just large organizations taking action to ensure market stability.

I think of it as this was probably something on their to-do list for awhile, especially since options started trading weekly. Sure, that may have happened in 2005, but if there is anything that can be said about massive organizations surrounding very large and complex systems, it takes a really, really long time to make adjustments.

Especially because the implications of the original underlying change take time to suss out further action required in other parts of the system based on the granular changes introduced.

In short, I find it inconclusive as evidence to support any particular idea surround GME. It's just as much speculation as it is probably them just doing some house cleaning.

DTCC is probably already talking/negotiating with the parties to fix this fuck up before it gets out of hand and crash the market.  The ball is in GME's court.  They can ask for billions and a large split ratio.  5-1, 10-1 if the shorters really really fucked up.  GME will be around $100 a share, GME gets around $50 billion in capitol from the shorters to keep the stock around $100-150.  So our pay out will depend on how big of a split, not how much the stock is worth, since the shorters will inject money to keep the stocks high enough so there isn't a class action lawsuit.

Unless Milennials suddenly start making enough money to move out to the suburbs with enough space and disposable income to build $150k home theater setups, nothing will replace the theater experience.

Things like the AMC A-List are great for getting consistent revenue and bodies in seats, and that had only just begun before COVID hit.

I was one of those people who hardly ever went to movies, and then the Moviepass craze hit.  That imploded obviously, but I signed us up for A-list memberships afterward for my family.  I have no self control so when we did go to the movies, you better believe I dropped $25 on $1.86 worth of popcorn and soda.  I went from spending maybe $100/year on movie related expenses to many times that, just because they gave me an effectively unlimited movie pass.  It doesn't cost the theater any more money to show a movie to 3 people than it does 300.

I will say though, I'd have gone with an AMC competitor option if available.  The AMC 3 mins from my house is still rocking the old seats and I'm a giant.  Marchs Theaters moved to those fancy loungers and we drove an extra 20 mins every time when I was still using Moviepass to sit in those instead.

689,GME," Another thing to keep in mind is that Wall Street loves to invent new ways of investing in the same product for the purposes of making more money.

One of the core reasons that the Housing Market Crash of 2008 became an international economic crisis was because Wall Street created Synthetic C.D.O’s.

Essentially, this allows a single investment to spawn a potentially infinite chain of investing as people invest on the outcomes of the investment.

Yet once the core investment failed, the chain of investments in that investment failed as well.

We see Wall Street do this now with GME. For example, they short ETF funds that have holdings in GME. 

This creates a roundabout method of shorting a stock that goes under the radar.

So no, I don’t believe that the short interest really changed that dramatically, especially since buying was halted and short ladder attacks were used to drive the prices back down again.

Besides, if all short interests were covered for GME, then shorters wouldn’t have lost nearly $1B from the Wednesday Spike for GME, and there would be millions more shares available to short.

On the plus side, I do see the share price going up slow burn style with the company turn around, and the amount of free press.  Also the fact of the inevitable squozitude of GME and the fact that shorts and MM will eventually be buying shares.  It makes it an easier buy. The narrative will change slowly Tesla style the longer the climb continues.  The snowball is definitely rolling.  If the price goes north of $1000 then a squoze will be more likely.

I don't ever seeing the price going to $40 again.  Even below $100 feels like a deal.  Soon $150 and $200 will have that same feeling. Will $300 and $500 feel like that?

Second, it is well documented that the original “squeeze” was only a gamma squeeze. Shorts didn’t truly cover and the volume didn’t exist for them to cover. They most likely closed their GME short position by disassembling ETF’s. The shares still need to be bought back. What is unclear to us is what price is needed for the shorts to begin getting margin called.

Given the actions of brokers/MM’s in late Jan, I have a feeling we know roughly where that threshold is.

720,GME," I think you might’ve misunderstood my statement but I get what you’re trying to say. Ultimately 1K is an actual possibility based on serious analysis and fundamentals of the stock market. Is it someone’s opinion to believe that it’ll hit 1K? Sure, because we can’t predict the future but we can make a serious educated assumption at that point. 100K? There’s no legitimate data in any way shape or form that point that that conclusion or outcome in the slightest. 

I find it ironic that me pointing this out ruffles some feathers and I get labelled a shill, but people promoting an unrealistic expectation that will likely put people in a potential harmful financial situation if they end up being bag holders because a delusional pipe dream are upvoted at a crazy rate and praised. 

Personally, I think a lot of the people who are pushing this narrative own a handful of shares at most and have nothing serious to lose if things spiral downwards and everyone else pushing it I believe are legitimately young investors (16-21 year olds) / new and naive investors. 

If people took the time to seriously analyze the situation and look at things rationally they’d likely conclude that yes 1K is possible and 100K is indeed a meme.

People will make their own decisions and shouldn’t take financial advice from strangers on the internet. If you have serious skin in the game it’s important to weigh your options and make a decision that is best for your life and circumstance. For me, the stock market is about making money, GME offers a super unique opportunity for me to generate life changing money and I won’t squander that on a theoretical long shot by waiting things out to see if they reach an astronomical number like 100K per share.

My understanding was the stock was pretty disastrous for employees with holdings the past ten years in regards to retirement planning.  It was a real solid stock.

Are you saying the SI isn't that low relative to other stocks?

Are you saying that the mental health impact of the pandemic (and subsequent knock on to public consumption of amenities)doesn't exist?

956,SI," This just is *not* true.

Everything I've said is literally available for anyone else to see or look at for themselves.

Are you saying AMC didn't dilute shares?

Are you saying ticket sales aren't in a double-decades long decline?

Are you saying home theatres aren't rising *rapidly*?

Are you saying the SI isn't that low relative to other stocks?

Are you saying that the mental health impact of the pandemic (and subsequent knock on to public consumption of amenities)doesn't exist?

Are you saying that AMC has good cash reserves after needing an emergency $900m cash injection?

Are you saying there's substantial evidence that AMC is:

- changing leadership  
- changing business strategies  
- encouraging new growth in cinema sector  
- innovating/incorporating technology

959,AMC," I told you before, I'm not doing the research for you.  You don't seem to realize that they continue to make moves to stay solvent, and moves to grow when they are.  You missed the fact that while their biggest competitor is still closed, they are opening.  You missed the streaming service they launched last year.  You fail to look at their actions following any major decline YoY, and see that they are doing things that will keep the company afloat or grow when needed.  People have been saying that the theater will die anytime a major change in format or new viewing options comes out, and the industry adapts.  The industry adapts, and AMC has shown in the past that it can adapt, and has taken steps to adapt to every situation thrown since they listed.  You haven't looked at the fact that they really only operate in the US and EU, so they have room for growth outside their normal customers once the pandemic eases worldwide.  You talk about psychological effect, yet have no idea what you're talking about.  People want a return to ""normal"" more than anything right now, and one of the largest drivers of summer ticket sales are teens, who are going to have freedom to hang out with friends in places they've been denied for months.  Do you have children?  Mine, and their friends, would see 2 to 3 movies a weekend.  The theater was always packed, so I'd have to assume I wasn't the only one.  Invest how you want, but you really need to dig deeper than looking at some charts and not the wider picture, they were trading twice what they are now precovid, recovering from a dip that was caused by and industry wide drop in ticket sales, the lowest in the US since 1995.  This was due to a massive drop in summer sales, so we'll know for sure if they are on the road to recovery after the summer box office counts.",bigsoftee84,22,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lzn0f0/what_is_really_behind_the_amc_meeting_on_may_4th/gq3w0sc/,0.059,0.893,0.048,-0.6705

963,TV," 25 dollars by the end of next year if they continue to have restrictions lifted and can back to operating normally.  They also have launched a new streaming service, which has been figuring into my valuations. They have streamlined the concession processes, meaning less wait and more sales at the counter, the big margin for profits.  Production companies have taken a hit from the loss of box office sales, and will probably want to get something out in theaters as soon as possible to increase their own revenue.  

I get it, the sub is fucking insane right now, and I always come off as an asshole regardless.  I'm not saying the shit is going to the moon, fuck no, and if it does I'll take my profits, and reinvest when it drops to a normal price.  I think that the stock should be at around the price it is, and wouldn't be surprised to see it drop before the end of summer, but it's not going to stay there.  They will either adapt or go bankrupt, my opinion is that they will adapt, because they've grown when needed and added technology and modernized as needed.  The industry will always take a hit during new formats, they said it was dead when VHS came out.  I'm sure they said it was dying when the TV showed up, but the industry adapts.

988,ATH," Bought ~2,100 ARKK on margin very close to the ATH (~$154 average). I considered the maintenance margin requirement at the time to be quite small - I figured ARKK would have to fall a whopping -25% for a margin call to get me, which seemed unlikely in this bull run - there are corrections, but what are the odds that a massive correction happens as soon as I buy? There's gotta be some unrealized gains that I can secure before the eventual correction, right? Plus, these are shares, not options, *and* it's a """"""diversified"""""" ETF across several industries - how bad can this play be? Even if it dips a little, I can sell weekly CCs to get back some losses, right?

As soon as I bought, the three-week correction began, which knocked down the whole market - but most of all the growth-oriented ARKK. Being on margin amplified my losses even more. I had to sell ~300 ARKK at the bottom to avoid a margin liquidation on Friday, left with 1800 now.

I know I should hold, lads, but it's getting scary at this point. Really hoping that ~$100 is the bottom. I can wait out for recovery to $150+ by selling CCs and HODLing, even if it takes a year. Another continuation of the back-to-back-to-back-to-back-to-back tech crash like last week, though, and I think I'm done for...

TSLA went down, but not to 550. So at first people were paying more for the put (the put price went up) so he made money up to 25k. He could have sold but he though TESLA was going to go even lower and would make even more money, like 40k, so he didn't sell. Then TSLA stopped going down and didn't go to 550.

Then his put ran out of time. Since tesla wasnt at 550 or below 550 it was worthless and he lost the 10k he paid for it.

""Sell DFV!!!  Sell damn you!!!"". Everyone else on Reddit was screaming for him to sell too.  I thought,  ""You made your money, stop being greedy!!!"".  There's a saying, ""Bulls Make Money, Bears Make Money, Pigs Get Slaughtered"".  I was like, ""DFV!!!! SELL!!!!!!!"".  But he never did...Ever...But why?!  Why didn't he sell?!  I thought, ""Okay, I'll read about why he thinks this stock was so undervalued"". So at first I peeked into the rabbit hole. Next thing I know, I dove headfirst in.  After reading hours of DD (Due Diligence) then finally watching DFV's aka Roaring Kitty's YouTube channel, it made sense.  I was a believer.  I drank the Kool-Aid.  All of it.  Then went back for more.  First of all, those snakey hedge funds were massively shorting Gamestop stock (GME).  Secondly, Ryan Cohen had just bought a HUGE amount of Gamestop shares and got on their board.  (Ryan Cohen was the guy who made online pet supplies profitable with Chewy unlike Pets dot com). This was a powder keg in the making.  The fuse being lit was WallStreetBets stating Gamestop's situation.  
More and more Redditors read the DD and came to the same conclusion on their own:  DFV was right.  Gamestop was undervalued and there was some behind the scenes stuff about short selling.  Buying the stock was the right move.  Remember when I told you my 401k allowed me to invest my money into investments of my choosing?  Well, I chose GME.  All of it into GME.  Was that wise?  At the time, Nope.  Would I recommend that move to a friend?  Nope.  But it was the best move for me.  Here was an actual, honest to goodness chance to stop having to clean pee and poop.  If I wanted to clean pee and poop from now on it was because I chose to.  Well, there were a lot of ups and downs with GME. Congressional hearings, class action lawsuits, and worst of all, unwarranted media shilling against Gamestop and retail buyers of the stock.  But in the end it worked out.  We won.  WE WON!!!!!  Gamestop is now trading at prices we would have thought unbelievable 5 years ago.  I still do clean pee and poop these days.  But it's because I have triplets and holy smokes it's more work than following GME in the early days...",Apollo_Thunderlipps,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lzciwt/gamestop_documentaries_5_years_from_now/gq2m5hj/,0.051,0.821,0.128,0.9922

1163,ASO," From an options chain perspective, it has a relatively high IV (though much lower than meme stocks) and not that much of a gamma ramp going for it. I like to see over 0.30% delta flux in my ramps... ASO is at 0.12% right now. This ramp extends out to $30 then starts to taper off pretty quickly.  On the downside, it goes to $21.  So, we're basically right at the hump and either direction will have a little bit of ""coast"" effect, but not much.

I might still dip my toes in.

The percentage goes above 100% due to shortselling.

When a share is shorted, it is duplicated into two shares. This makes it possible for a stock to have 200% ownership of its shares.

200% Ownership = 100% Short Interest.

1180,GME," Extra detail of how shorting duplicates shares:

When an investor buys GME using a margin loan, the brokerage can legally lend that share to another investor to shortsell.

When an investor shortsells GME, they sell the share to a third person that doesn’t know the share actually belongs to another investor.

This calculates as two shares, owned by two different people. But it is the same share that’s duplicated.

On top of this, a brokerage can shortsell a share twice. So, one share can have three owners that don’t know the share has been cloned twice. It is still one share, but three owners.

This results in 300% of Float Held. 🚀",ilikeyouforyou,16,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lzwgnn/bloomberg_financials_of_gme_share_of_float_at_130/gq4k43i/,0.0,0.836,0.164,0.8625

Edit it gets more confusing removing what insiders own, individuals own, brokers etc cause then the 135% of float is looking a little bit higher than 5x what individual owns.

1190,RH," A**round liquidity of settling options.** **The document very specifically talks about options settlement and not typical equity or stock.** 

Therefore, this does not just mean ""shorts have to cover."" It means the DTCC wants to hedge risk against the amount of options created, whether they're uncovered or not, and whether there is enough of the underlying equity and/or cash to be able to settle in the event of a Member defaulting.

I wouldn't be surprised if part of it is due to the RH fiasco prompting this, although it does still seem the urgency and language used could be pre-meditated.

I just look at the factual side of what this rules change means rather than speculate for confirmation bias. DTCC doesn't want the NSCC to get fucked, and in turn the DTCC, in the event of an institution not having enough stock or cash to settle options going ITM.

1251,WELL," Fisker has like 1-2 prototypes and ""experts"" upgraded their rating. They only recently found a manfacturing partner, which isn't even an automaker. Fisker Ocean is competing in the MOST COMPETITIVE SPACE there is in EV right now: the crossover SUV. Everyone is making one. Tesla, Volva, BMW, GM, Ford. Everyone has a crossover or are building one right now. 

Meanwhile, Canoo is WELL into road tests with their many completed prototypes. Their agreement with Hyundai has been signed for a while and they're well into setting up an assembly line for their product. 


I have a sneaking suspicion they will announce a partnership with Uber. Ridesharing + subscription car model fits so well together. Uber Green needs more cars on the road.

1258,RKT," So Utilization rate is 99.76 percent which is all the short shares that are available are basically checked out... This actually decreased from Wednesday to Thursday so some shorts did cover... I'll post fridays numbers when they are available on Monday, But the fact that the estimated short interest is 2 million shares higher than the shares on loan means that some naked shorting is probably going on...  My argument is not that this is only going to the moon because of a short squeeze but should there be an announcement on Saturday which fundamentally changes the valuation of the company ... 8 million shares will run for the door... In fact they might run for the door before then... Which is 10 percent of the free float... Should this get out of hand you can see some margin calls...like on RKT.. The DTC is also important that it would take shorts 1.5 days to fully cover if ever buy was just shorts covering... 8 million shares x sp is almost 100m dollars...",BrotherLuminous,0,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lzd9js/goev_the_bull_case_of_canoo_inc_aka_goev_aka/gq24emy/,0.01,0.863,0.128,0.9618
1259,IBKR," [https://ibkr.info/article/3044](https://ibkr.info/article/3044)

""Utilization is defined as loaned shares divided by available shares in the securities lending market, expressed as a percentage. The Utilization metric on TWS is not specific to IB. It is based on industrywide data provided by a securities finance data vendor. The metric is not conclusive however, as not every lender reports their Utilization to the vendor. In addition, although the source is believed to be reliable, IBKR does not warrant its accuracy.

Generally, Utilization is the ratio of demand to supply. For example, Apple Inc. (AAPL) may have utilization of less than 1% because the stock has vast availability relative to the demand to borrow shares for shorting. Roku Inc. (ROKU) may have utilization above 90% because of higher demand to short shares as compared to the number of available shares.""

Wait, so you're telling me 99.8% of available shares are shorted (assuming reporting is accurate, but we know they don't accurately report it)?

If people don't believe what you tell them, they have that right.

Calling other people idiots is the kind of echo chamber bullshit we genuinely do not need. Because then there is no ""level headed"" anywhere. Accept new information or you are a fool. Period.

It should be reflexive to you to present information is a well organized manner based on actual facts and not just things you believe to be facts. 

An example: Gamestop is extremely shorted and if the price rises high enough it will cause a short squeeze and force the hedge funds to buy our shares.

Palantir is a disruptive tech at this point. Disruptive techs can't be priced in with PE like coca cola, but with news and real word changing conditions . They have no direct competitors in a sector really young . We can all be pessimist but Tesla proved last year  what a change in situation can do to a leader in the sector.

&#x200B;

Palantir is it's own sector at this point unmatched due to over 10 years of working on their software through government and personal money invested in it at no profit.

You might see tomorrow : Palantir awarded 6b for the next 3 years for developping software bla bla, which is instant 2b revs yearly just from government alone (based on the DD made posted above as an example) which is more than what they have atm.

1385,SO," There are very clear rules on buybacks.  
From what I understand they can only be 25% of the average float per day.  
I think this would work out to a maximum of say 1,000,000 shares per day. Or $25,000,000 spend a day. This would exhaust their buy back in 40 days.  


There are MANY rules where the company can not buy back because it really is market manipulation on the price, so they have to be very careful they are not buying back because they are aware of any non-public information.

In my opinion they did not want to start the buyback while they were issuing the dividend. Now that this is done and they see their SP still on the low end they may decide to buy back over some fixed time frame. This would mean they are consistent in the SEC eyes and are not manipulating the price. Short squeezes are totally illegal from an orchestrated POV. So they don't want to be seen acting in accordance with that.   


SO if they were to say buy over 100 days then that is $10,000,000 per day or 500k shares. This would still drive the price up a bit, signal a new floor... And be overall great.

Why would I want to invest in a company that’s “fairly valued” but has failed to give a positive return to its investors in over 5 years? The fact that Ford sells millions of cars but its stock has slid 10% in 5 years is precisely why it’s a poor investment. “Fair valuation” is a term used by Wall Street boomers who actually studied the financials of a stock and worked for risk-averse funds and would refuse to invest in anything speculative. Now, retail investors have easy access to investments and are willing to risk their money at a chance for a better rate of return than an annual 5%x Nowadays a company’s stock is worth whatever the next buyer is willing to pay for it.

It's not to say that's the end of the bull market, it's that the market was sitting so high people took profit, and are taking profit.

So you're pretty spot on P/E almost doesn't matter anymore...or the idea of what's overvalued needs to be reconsidered because it will be higher so long as bonds are not a viable investment. Besides, first things to sell off are always the extremely overvalued. Honestly best bet are probably stocks that are cash cows with relatively low PE on the next run up.

1541,RE," The conspiracist in me likes to believe it’s a way of maintaining a sort of social fear, call it. Which ultimately helped to continue strong sentiment for porky stimulus borrowing at a local, national and international level. 

There are relatively unsustainable real estate bubbles in major cities across the world and nothing would initiate them popping faster than another mortgage crisis in the US. 

COVID definitely threw a wrench in the RE asset markets when it came to macro economic balancing, but I’ve watched my very large clients ($10b - $200b portfolios) reconfigure terms an shift borrowing facilities to protect them in the near future. Air money is cheap for AAA credit. 

When this is revisited in 5 and 10 years, we could be in a world of hurt, but such is life, and the posts will probably get moved again, stretching that elastic band even further.
