2,RH," Don't trade on margin. Just use a cash account and disable the margin trading option. RH auto enables margin for you and I think there's a way to disable it.

Pretty much margin is trading with money thats not yours. Say you buy 1k worth of stock, 500 cash and 500 margin because you didn't have the full 1k in cash. You now owe 500 to your broker and will receive a margin call to repay it, if you don't have the money it will put your account in the negative. I always disable margin but if you plan to use it make sure you pay attention to your available cash and margin so you know for sure when your trading on margin. Most brokers make you apply for it, RH just allows you to do it willy nilly.",IGfodder,95,/r/pennystocks/comments/m9mv1k/me_these_past_couple_of_weeks/gro1wv0/,0.028,0.905,0.067,0.6705

4,TDA," TDA allows you to trade immediately upon deposit with uncleared funds, (there are rules though and this shouldn't include penny stocks, you can't trade below $5) which most other brokers won't do. However, those funds are margin funds until the money clears. 3-5 days. If trading on margin, your maintenance requirement must stay in the green, otherwise you'll be called going into the next day. Normally you'd have a few days to clear it, but with covid-19 crashes they're forced to call margin instantly now.",Hypochlorite_Tank_2,6,/r/pennystocks/comments/m9mv1k/me_these_past_couple_of_weeks/grp2661/,0.045,0.921,0.034,-0.4678
5,TD," I use TD and upgraded to margin account so I could buy calls/puts because I couldn’t before. My account is for cash only and I didn’t want margin but did it to be able to get an option here and there. If I message them and ask to disable margin will it also stop me from buying options? I never plan on using margin or more cash than I have, also don’t want to open my portfolio and see stocks gone off a margin call (can they do that if I haven’t dipped into margin?)",osocinco,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/m9mv1k/me_these_past_couple_of_weeks/grp45iy/,0.036,0.935,0.029,-0.3736
6,TD," Options trading is something you specifically selected when you opened your TD account and shouldn’t require margin but having said that I find it weird that they made you get margin before you could start trading options, so they might disable it if you remove margin from your account. I would check with them.",ShrimpSandwich1,2,/r/pennystocks/comments/m9mv1k/me_these_past_couple_of_weeks/grp6ad6/,0.039,0.961,0.0,-0.2617
7,TD," Yeah TD charges $6.95 to buy and sell OTC. Just factor it into your buy and it’s a non issue. In regards to margin, having it attached to your account is nice because it gives you the ability to trade immediately and not have to wait for funds to settle. 

So let’s say you have $1000 in your account as cash, and you have margin. You want to buy an OTC stock at, say, $1.00/share. So you could buy 993 shares and you’re left with $0.05 as your cash balance. Now you sell at $2.00/share which gives you $1979.10 (993*2-6.95+0.05) cash balance *but* you normally have to wait 2 days for the funds to settle without margin but you have margin so now you can spend that money immediately instead of waiting the 2 days. 

All you have to do is look at your cash balance on ToS and hand calculate your trades before you set your orders. It’s an extra step but it saves you money (Option Calls) and you don’t have to worry about losing out on anything that might run while your funds are settling.",ShrimpSandwich1,2,/r/pennystocks/comments/m9mv1k/me_these_past_couple_of_weeks/grp603p/,0.045,0.893,0.062,0.1027

21,DD," ETFs are the way to go, the industry is still so young there's not a lot of telling what american companies will sink or swim. That said if you're looking at Canadian companies, do some serious DD into which have investments and contracts with weed farms in the states. Those are the companies that will benefit most in the short term from legalization in the US as comparitvely larger american growers could (hypothetically) catch them a better price, if cannabis as an agriculture product is regulated similar to other produce. Think Bolthouse Farms(grimway/caloranic) except for weed.

Everyone else, including high tide, would have to wait to build the infrastructure to expand into the US market. Could they be the Tim Horton's of weed paraphernalia? Who knows?

Then there's biotech companies like 22nd century (xxii) that have designed modified strains of cannabis with variable THC which could benefit from any possible pushback legislation regarding THC levels. Idk how much legalization would help them in the short term though. That said, approaching this market from a biotech angle makes most sense to me at this point since we have no idea what regulation would look like or even if interstate retail is going to be a serious thing yet. It's just too early.

So the final info. is known already.  It is naive to think it isn't.  What reason are they giving not having the final data to publish?  

Seems no insider buy/sells since 2018?  That was a 4 MILLION share sell by the CEO herself.    

Institutional ownership is basically zero.  

So you have a drug that may be the only good treatment for a fatal disease in GBM and no insider buy since around 2016 OR institutional client wants to partake in it?  Retail investors found a $20 bill on the sidewalk that no one else cares to pick up who are more in the know ?  

If their finances are so bad and they have other studies they are trying to get done why not do partnerships with big pharma companies?  So they would rather go broke then take on financial help?  Or is it that no pharma companies offered to do a JV with them?  Which is it?

Just some questions I would have if I was putting money into the play.  Not saying good or bad to invest in it just curious what answers management (CEO has a very shady past) is giving to answer some of these questions which I am SURE have been asked already.",10xwannabe,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/m9xfhn/dd_northwest_biotherapeutics_nwbo_go_big_or_go/grqsll0/,0.094,0.8,0.106,0.3205

112,III," Can you be more clear on what you mean by approval by FDA? 

I looked at the company and they have 1 study in their ENTIRE history of their pipeline that was logged through clinicaltrials.gov.  It was only a phase I for caverstem in 2019. 

From Yahoo finance they mentioned they are awaiting hearing for FDA to start a trial on spinestem STUDY which would be phase I as well.  Is that what you were referring to?

I am hoping you are not confusing any of this as them getting FDA approval.  They have to go through phase I, then II, then III, the apply for NDA then 1.-2 years later if your lucky get FDA approval.  

Their study for caverstem was done in 2019 and saw it was published in 2020 and no info of them going for phase II?  So looks like they are going to scrap that one?  

I know other stem cell companies tried to bypass FDA NDA by saying they are a device company instead and getting denied and having to go through the same process as any drug (ones mentioned above).

If I am missing something please correct me otherwise I am assuming you are are excited about a drug that may get a approved to start a phase I which may or may advance beyond that?  They have some study they did outside of FDA (think outside of the country) which was not even peer reviewed and published on SRN per the yahoo finance article discussing spinestem so who knows how valid that was.

122,TRCH," I'll keep this as short as possible, if you have a question, ask. TRCH is merging with a company called MMATF, it's an OTC and it's using TRCH as a shell to get onto the NASDAQ. After the merger, holders of MMATF shares are going to be given extra shares at a conversion rate of 1:3.706 give or take. That means if you hold 100 shares now, you hold 370 shares after the merger. Things worth mentioning:

1. The listing price of MMAT after the merger will be the same price of TRCH at closing the day before the merger.
2. If you are holding TRCH shares before the merger, you'll be eligible for the special one-time dividend, I personally think it's a gamble but to each their own.

What this means is, if the merger were tomorrow and TRCH is valued at $2.22 and you were holding 100 shares of MMATF, you would have 370 shares of MMAT after the merger with a value of $2.22 EACH.

What does this mean? Your MMATF that cost $2.78 right now, are worth $2.22 x 3.706 after the merger or $8.23. That's almost a 4x return and MMAT hasn't even done anything yet! But Baggy, is this a safe play? What if TRCH drops down to $2 a share?

If you buy MMATF for $2.80 each and TRCH went through the merger at a measly 70 cents, you would break even. That's right, TRCH would need to lose literally 75% of it's current value before MMATF even considered losing value.

I read that on some homepages. These companies seem to exist to exploit new traders. And these will loose money. The stockes seem to be worth only a small part of the amount of the chart and they give out new stocks for the half and than sell them more expensiv.

144,TBA," It's definitely a hen's tooth, but I'll just reiterate here what's going on, exactly:

I personally tweeted the founder of Metamaterials Inc about a week ago his name is     @ GeorgePalikaras

I asked specifically about the conversion rate and the eligibility cut off date. As far as the former, I've already stated it. As for the latter, the cut off date is the day before the merger which is still TBA.

As far as the dividend, TRCH has 6 months after the merger date to complete selling of their assets. If they do not sell them you will not get a dividend and instead be given shares of a stock into their holding company (I have no idea what it is and do not trust the play), but that's just my opinion and you could absolutely receive a decent dividend.

The only risk I can see with this play is the one I've already mentioned. Buying MMATF at the current price is a heck of a bargain, as long as TRCH goes through the merger @ at least 70 cents. If it drops below that, you're not going to see any immediate gains post merger, but anything above 70 cents is gravy.

About Metamaterials, they make cool, hi-tec things in all of the big sectors (Aerospace & Defense, Automotive, Medical, Tech & Energy). You can check them out here [https://metamaterial.com/solutions/](https://metamaterial.com/solutions/) but I'll list a few major ones:

The only risk I can see with this play is the one I've already mentioned. Buying MMATF at the current price is a heck of a bargain, as long as TRCH goes through the merger @ at least 70 cents. If it drops below that, you're not going to see any immediate gains post merger, but anything above 70 cents is gravy.

About Metamaterials, they make cool, hi-tec things in all of the big sectors (Aerospace & Defense, Automotive, Medical, Tech & Energy). You can check them out here [https://metamaterial.com/solutions/](https://metamaterial.com/solutions/) but I'll list a few major ones:

1. Transparent 5G Antennas for cars (Tesla interest Rumor)
2. Needless Sugar Test for patients with Diabetes
3. Laser Glare Protection eyewear for Pilots (MetaAir)

I'm long MMAT so immediate gains or not, I'm HODL. I can see this company going to $10 by EoY. Again, I'm not a financial advisor.",BagboyBrown,2,/r/pennystocks/comments/m9nagf/the_lounge_thoughts_noob_stuff_low_effort_brokers/gro678p/,0.048,0.859,0.092,0.9026
146,DD," That is incorrect.

1. TRCH to MMAT is 1:1 with Dividend Eligibility.
2. MMATF to MMAT is 1:3.706 with no Dividend.

TRCH is worth 25% of the company and MMATF is worth the other 75%. The conversion rate comes from TRCH having more outstanding shares than MMATF and since TRCH is the shell (this is a reverse merger), that's how many shares the company is going to have.

There is no dilution to the price of TRCH. If the merger is tomorrow and TRCH closes today @ $2, MMAT will open tomorrow @ $2. Like I said, I've personally tweeted the Founder / CEO of the company to clear up any misinformation out there.

As far as buying MMATF at today's price of $2.75, I've already explained that it is and why it is a bargain. If MMATF goes up to $4 before the merger or down to 50 cents, it doesn't matter. It's worth 3.7x whatever TRCH is worth at closing the day prior to the merger.

MMATF has been over $3.50 a couple times and I held it (being up 50% on a $7500 position) because I believe it's just the tip of what's to come. But I understand there's skeptics out there who can't do their own DD.",BagboyBrown,4,/r/pennystocks/comments/m9nagf/the_lounge_thoughts_noob_stuff_low_effort_brokers/grob594/,0.042,0.849,0.109,0.927

148,TRCH," MMATF is better, imo. It's OTC so you'll need  broker that allows trading of them. If you are in Canada then it's on the CSE as just MMAT.CN or whatever, it's the same thing (Metamaterials Inc).

The merger isn't for another 30-60 days (date TBA) so you have that long to get an account together that allows trading of OTC stocks. If you do not wish to go through the trouble (though I recommend you do for this stock and all future OTC stocks you may wish to trade), it is absolutely fine to pick up TRCH, but it's a bit trickier.

As far as MMATF, we don't really care what it costs as long as it's under $7 a share. But for TRCH, I personally wouldn't buy it over $2.10 and if dropped to $1.80 I would buy the dip. In the same the breath if it never hits $2.10 and it's the day before the merger, I will pick up TRCH shares just to be eligible for the dividend. It's going to cost the same price post merger anyway, but you will not be eligible for the dividend.

I'm not saying this is good advice or that you should do it, I can only legally tell you what I'm personally doing.",BagboyBrown,3,/r/pennystocks/comments/m9nagf/the_lounge_thoughts_noob_stuff_low_effort_brokers/gro9ucq/,0.049,0.877,0.074,0.6566
149,NIO," Here are my thoughts on your pics.  Since we agree on CWSFF and PONGF, I am not including these.  Just keep in mind that most of what I say can probably be said about my pics as well, so I'm not picking them apart.

INTV - bitcoin mining.  Crypto scares me since one piece of legislation can wipe it out tomorrow.  I generally stay away.  However, others have made a lot of money on crypto.

IQST - I owned this briefly a month or so ago.  It has gone from $0.30 to over $1 since early Feb.  I figure I missed the run on this one.  The big question is, does it have juice for a further run.

ADOM - EV play.  EV seems to be losing steam (e.g. NIO, NKLA) but could pick up.  I like this one and will be watching it.

KAVL - Vaping play which is cash flow positive...always a good sign.  I do not know enough about the market to know whether they can increase.  If their products can be extended for marijuana vaping, which I assume they could, this could be a good play and see a run once cannabis is legalized.

UISO - payment processing play.  The biggest red flag I see is that it has gone from $2 in Dec. to $6 today.  I feel I'm too late on this one.  Or maybe it's still early?  It's hard to judge, so my conservative self says to stay on the sidelines.

FCSMF - mining play which is pre-revenue.  Could be a very good speculative play, but seems like it could be longer term until they are able to see results.  I base this on the fact that it seems their mine is in N. Quebec, so they likely cannot start mining until May when the ground thaws.

ILUS - This one is up 12,000% since Jan. 1.  Did I miss the run on this?  Or does it keep running?

NLST - Data storage/computing play.  Decent revenue growth and could be cash flow positive in a year or two.  It is up 200% this year.  May still be early enough to get in, but I again question if I missed the run.",PoopSkipPotato,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/m9nagf/the_lounge_thoughts_noob_stuff_low_effort_brokers/grpiy97/,0.028,0.825,0.146,0.993

I'm pretty much going to avoid TD for buying this type of stock and stick to my Schwab or Fidelity since they are a little more clear about that fee.
