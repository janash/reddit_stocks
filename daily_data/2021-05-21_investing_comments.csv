Money supply is VERY important. Do you care about the slave trade? In west Africa, the currency was glass beads. Europeans realized they could manufacture glass beads cheaply and bring them over by the boatload to go shopping. This left Africa with a lot of glass beads and Europe with all of their goods and possessions. When they were so impoverished, the logical next step was to buy the people themselves. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade\_beads

Paypal is not useful in many countries, especially places with high unbanked populations. It is also censored many places where it is needed most - Venezuela and Palestine for example. I send Bitcoin to unbanked family overseas far cheaper than any bank or remittance service can (due to exchanges batching transactions, my network fee is usually \~$1), and they can exchange it for local currency faster and cheaper than any other method.

US Dollars have lost 99% of purchasing power over the past 100 years, and over that period of time, there have been numerous ""bank runs"" where customers try to withdraw their funds and the banks can't fulfill it. It's unlikely, but the time this would happen is when you need it most.

I don't use it as a currency, and wouldn't advise anyone to - other than for large international transactions. It's interesting to see the government refer to them as ""cryptoassets"" here. I think it's more likely that some central banks will need to prop up their fiat currencies by backing them with Bitcoin. Furthermore, Bitcoin is likely to replace the USD as the global reserve currency, because it doesn't give the economic advantage of ""reserve"" status to a single nation, and it also makes more sense for international trade rather than pricing in petrodollar.",Connect_Werewolf_754,8,/r/investing/comments/nhbpf8/us_seeks_to_have_cryptocurrency_transfers_above/gyw3l9d/,0.033,0.901,0.065,0.9551

I can't help but think it's ridiculous to assume that that cryptocurrencies *will* transform the global monetary system (or even has the capability of doing so). The most plausible scenarios I see are:

a) cryptocurrencies as we currently know them are entirely reinvented (and all the coins we use right now will be antiques and/or worthless). As much as crypto's have gained mainstream acceptance as a speculative investment, their use as a medium of exchange is going to stay niche unless some monumental hurdles are overcome.

b) the climate disaster in the coming century ends up being far worse than anticipated and crypto's are favorably situated to be the most convenient medium of exchange.

28,TBC," I'm not sure I agree about the unregulated point you're making, though I also am not sure Bitcoin/Ethereum will be the final state.

The issue is that monetary control has huge implications globally. Maybe it doesn't affect you much in your first-world life (unless you happen to be carrying nontrivial cash and [a cop pulls you over in the US and decides to take it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_forfeiture_in_the_United_States)) but if you take Venezuela going from relatively wealthy nation to destitute poverty due to monetary controls from its government, China's capital controls not only affecting its people but distorting markets worldwide like London and Vancouver as Chinese citizens try to get money out, Argentina (historically and seemingly again now) and countless others, I do think tools to decrease monetary power of such governments will become more useful. TBC, I don't think Bitcoin or Ethereum are those tools today. They are in use in Venezuela and such, but at least to the degree we can measure them, I'm not sure they're having meaningful impact yet.

Then there's the whole world of remittances: Western Union, Moneygram, and others like them charge obscene rates to send money worldwide, often to poor immigrants sending meager earnings back to their families. Again, not saying Bitcoin or Ethereum or anything else here is solving them, but I don't think the status quo is good, and I don't think a ""regulated cryptocurrency"" will solve it either, and I do think something _like_ Bitcoin _could_ help with problems like that.

Yes, the volatility is insane, the energy problems are real, and to an outsider it looks like a giant pyramid scheme. But at the same time, we've never actually bootstrapped a currency from nothing, with no government/force backing it, and I'm not really sure whether it's even possible. But if I play out hypothetical scenarios of what it might look like, it seems like it would look an awful lot like what we're seeing, with crazy volatility, accusations of pyramid scheme peddlers, and all the usual, and maybe someday stability if enough people believe in it.

tl;dr: I'm not necessarily sold on the current offerings, but I don't think ""regulated crpytocurrencies"" will be the future either, and I think there's a lot of shitty outcomes out there due to today's money that I'd like to believe can actually be improved upon",godofpumpkins,15,/r/investing/comments/nhbpf8/us_seeks_to_have_cryptocurrency_transfers_above/gyw0j7c/,0.113,0.739,0.149,0.9362

34,ETH," That situation is arguably changing for Ethereum, due to an upgrade happening this summer. They're switching to a system where instead of paying transaction fees entirely to miners, the fees are partially destroyed. (Fees are in ETH.)

If you agree that stock buybacks are equivalent to dividends, then the fee burn is equivalent to dividends paid to everyone who holds ETH.

That only really works out if the issuance of new ETH is less than the fee burn, but issuance is going to drop dramatically as well due to the transition to proof-of-stake.

Fees represent real-world value paid by users in accordance with the value they place on getting their transaction through, so imho all this actually does establish intrinsic value for ETH.

This part of the article is truly why I hope my steel thesis is accurate. If it's not, I don't want to know what our country looks like in a decade.

I believe Lourenco Goncalves truly wants to see the folks that work in his industry succeed as much or moreso than himself or CLF itself. That altruism will be key to the success of CLF over the next decade.

42,CLF," CLF, MT, and TX are my picks. All are very undervalued right now. Especially CLF today, but that also has a large short position right now. X’s share price looks like it’s doing well, but is more risky due to more questionable management. 

- CLF just bought MT’s North American assets, so is in debt now but should be able to pay it off quickly. Largest producer in NA, depending on how you count it.

- MT is the largest global steel producer. Outside of China of course. 

- TX is the largest Latin American producer and can sell to the US via NAFTA. Is also bringing production facilities online this summer.

Why are they there? Until the past few months, steel in the US was a dying industry and CLF had just took on quite a bit of debt. If CLF couldn't pay off the debt, they would be sunk.

Looked up lobby spending for steel and to me it looks like that has cooled off.  CLF last shows up in Oct 2020, and nothing from X after Jan 2021.

X also cancelled an investment not so long ago.  That could be local pressure maybe but my bet is that its really uncertainty of tariffs and future legislation.",sleeksleep,3,/r/investing/comments/nhwhxu/nyt_soaring_prices_herald_boom_time_for_steel/gyzchem/,0.069,0.802,0.129,0.7776

57,AMZN," I’m not particularly bullish on AMZN because I see the quality of their consumer service degrading with a big influx of 3rd party sellers and counterfeits.   I think this will hurt their retail front medium to long term.  Likewise, aws competitors are springing up like weeds with comparable or easier management interfaces and lower costs, so I feel that segment is at risk of stagnation due to competition.

The bull case is fairly obvious I think - huge market penetration for online retail, lots of new users who are likely to continue to value the convenience of easy online retail, and they’re basically the gold standard for outsourced server space with aws.   I certainly wouldn’t bet against them.   With reopening, businesses reliant on aws will likely pick up some of the sag from reduced home use of services.  Aws billing is complex and not based solely on bandwidth, and I’d imagine high users of bandwidth like Netflix have specific contracts out.

If I were forced to take a position, I’d go long on Amazon, but I wouldn’t be surprised if they trade flat for a while.",rgar132,22,/r/investing/comments/nhixq1/how_will_reopening_affect_amazon/gywlrhi/,0.052,0.846,0.102,0.6652

60,IT," Yeah agreed, I’ve had similar experiences in the past year or two with Amazon, but continue to use them due to convenience and a solid return policy for when I’m not satisfied with something.   I’ve found myself checking there and ordering somewhere else lately due to not wanting to deal with the hassle of a return though, and higher prices + sales tax on Amazon often making it less advantageous price wise.

As far as aws goes, they’re the gold standard.   In my day job I’m in a position where we require outsourced server capacity and aws was a contender, but not selected due to total ongoing cost and required management expertise.   The vendor ultimately selected was about 30-40% less expensive with full coverage of Europe, asia, us, and Canada in 4 regional centers, and has proven reliable.   The IT guys like the interface better and find it easier to manage as well.   It’s a relatively small business use case as compared to mega corporations, and I agree aws will continue to do just fine, but it doesn’t make me feel real bullish on them at the moment when I was in the market for their service and found it to be middle of the pack for cost and deployability.

66,IRS," Good morning contrarians!

Futures are moving higher this morning, with the Dow and S&P up about 0.4%. Nasdaq is 0.2% higher. This follows a rebound yesterday when tech booked major gains (Nasdaq rallied 1.8% and is now on track to break a four-week losing streak).

Another post-pandemic low in initial jobless claims yesterday does appear to have helped. Goes to show that just when you don’t see any catalysts for a rally, investors come in and bid things up. This tends to happen in bull markets. We’re still in a bull market. Probably will be for a little while.

96,PEB," > And to say this is from the pandemic doesnt seem reasonable either as the share price had already dropped into the 20's in ~mid 2019. So...

Could easily have been a not great business already that was further impacted by the pandemic. PEB - another hotel REIT that actually is well-managed (as hotel REITs go) has a similar price action pre-pandemic and then went down significantly during (and that REIT's properties were particularly effected given that they were high-end properties in major cities.) Ashford cut 95% of staff during the pandemic - https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ashford-hospitality-trust-hotel-executive-monty-bennett-layoff-furlough-95-percent-staff/

Given that this is a hotel REIT, hotel REITs were absolutely obliterated by the pandemic and are generally horrendously poor performers in any sort of economic downturn - many of them cut their dividend in 2008 entirely and many didn't bring back the div until years later. I'm not familiar with Ashford but I do see that they suggested in December that bankruptcy was a possibility. It's bounced recently with other hotel REITs as things have gotten somewhat better with travel. Personally, hotel REITs are not something that I really focus on - they do well coming out of a downturn, are generally so-so performers when things are great and then the moment there's the slightest hint of another downturn, they crater.

99,IP," The valuation is excessive, there's little/no moat and you can get exposure to various plant-based milks via Danone (which owns Silk via the Whitewave purchase) at a much more reasonable valuation with a decent dividend. That stock hasn't done great over the last 5 years, but it's some exposure to plant based that's more of a value/income play (and at least Silk isn't just oat milk - tastes can/do change.) 

I don't own it (and I really don't have interest in these sorts of things) but that's another option. I'm not denying that ""plant-based"" is a theme that's here to stay but something being ""plant based"" doesn't necessarily make it a great long-term investment; it's very easy for larger brands to compete. Shorter-term, hype can certainly do very well although this year there seems to be a lot less appetite for richly valued growth stories than last year.

Grocery broadly is tough - it's an industry with thin margins, not much in the way of moat and a lot of competition. Whole Foods was a hot growth stock for a long time until other grocers decided they wanted in on the category and that was that. Whole Foods got bought by Amazon way off the highs and one could argue that they haven't really improved things there since that purchase. ""While parent company Amazon reported strong fiscal first quarter sales overall last month, its brick-and-mortar grocery stores have performed less well. Sales at the Seattle-based company’s physical grocery stores—which is comprised mainly of some 500 Whole Foods Market locations but does not include sales originating online and fulfilled from them, like Prime delivery—decreased by 16% to $3.9 billion in the quarter. "" (https://www.winsightgrocerybusiness.com/retailers/what-do-whole-foods-operational-changes-mean-its-future)

Look at A2 Milk - that isn't plant-based but was a ""hot milk stock"" for a while until last year when it unraveled and lost something like 70% of its value since last Summer.

After dabbling myself, crypto takes too much of my energy away day-to-day.  It can get too stressful, especially during bull runs when you are seeing in everywhere.  I bought 10 ETH for $1,000 in January 2019.  It had been completely out of the news cycle, and I had $1,000 I was willing to let go to $0. 

I sold at $378 and made a couple thousand bucks.  Looking at prices from a couple weeks ago, I could have made about $35,000.

I have a lump sum which I want to invest roughly in a market ETF along with some overweight sectors. But I’m not starting from scratch. This is how it is right now:

Cash 52%

My goal is to reduce it to VT or VOO plus 3 or 4 thematic investments like dividends, health, tech and EM.

148,IMO," by shape, I assume you mean sharpe.

Its not that trivial as you might think, for there are many assumptions that goes into calculating the optimal asset allocation. Input are expectations of returns portfolios and risk modeling is not trivial. Asset Managers charge millions to do this for institutions.

IMO, you are better off hiring investment advisor if you are hni, then doing it yourself as optimizations are notorious to sensitivity of inputs. I will again tell you, its not trivial to do on app. Better off buy some etf/hire investment advisor.

But still if you insist, and as a purely for your knowledge - you can try [www.portfoliovisualizer.com](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com) or search for efficient frontier solvers. These do not have expected returns modeling, but rather past data.

Please do not use these to make investment allocations, you will mess up.",shuonya,3,/r/investing/comments/nhzs5m/how_to_calculate_optimal_asset_allocation_based/gyz5rzo/,0.056,0.818,0.126,0.7435
