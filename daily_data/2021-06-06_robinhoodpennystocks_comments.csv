13,DD," Ki-67 functions as a marker for cell proliferation. Atossa is artificially suppressing Ki-67 through the use oral endoxifen, which is ultimately detrimental to efficacious treatment of metastatic cancer. Considering Ki-67 functions as only a MARKER for aberrant growth of cells, it does not indicate whether proliferation continues to occur. To suppress the levels of Ki-67 though oral endoxifen becomes detrimental to successful treatment of cancer due to physicians not being able to adequately access the markers. Additionally, the trials are occurring in Australia to facilitate market access. Australia‚Äôs guidelines for approval depend on the premise of ‚Äúdo not harm‚Äù as opposed to efficacy of treatment protocols (FDA). Management is aware the majority of ‚Äúinvestors‚Äù do not understand the science as unfortunately it is exceptionally convoluted; however, they do not explicitly disclose that Ki-67 is intended to be used as a marker pre, intra, post administration of treatment protocol to determine success of treatment. Returning the the initial remark, oral endoxifen is articulacy suppressing an essential marker prior to treatment commencing which could present the possibility for considerably worse outcomes. Trials occurring in Australia are predominantly only concerned with a drug having adverse side effects, which oral endoxifen does not. For anybody interested in further DD, go to google scholar or pubmed to search how Ki-67 is intended to be used.",number531,3,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/ntdvo3/atosinterim_results_that_were_not_posted/h0sn15t/,0.081,0.864,0.055,-0.7312
