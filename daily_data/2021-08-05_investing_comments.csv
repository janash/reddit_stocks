On march 11th 2021, they warned us about equities in an article you can look up ""Goldman Sachs warns US markets will face further sharp fall"" I'm not sure if the websites articles I'm finding these are whitelisted. They said the crash would happen over 3 months but in the following weeks we smashed past it. [Here is the reddit thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/fh4h9g/goldman_sachs_warns_us_markets_will_face_further/)

  
9 Months ago they gave the S&P a price target of 4300 by the end of 2021, S&P at 3500 at the time. [Here is the reddit thread:](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/jssdj1/goldman_sachs_has_just_boosted_its_sp_target/) and top comment is.. Goldman Sachs has just boosted its S&P Target. Here's why: To offload their equities to you.

I'd argue that it's completely rational - the fundamentals of the business do not support the insane valuation. 

A $10B company is attempting to completely revamp their entire business model from 5,000+ brick and mortar stores to E-commerce.

58,UK," ""Anyone else worried about new variants?""

I'm concerned but (100,000+ or whatever the # was people at Lollapalooza) clearly a lot of people aren't. Someone replied to a comment that I made yesterday noting that the Delta variant seems to have peaked in the UK and former FDA head Scott Gottlieb suggested recently that it might peak in the US with a few weeks (https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/26/dr-scott-gottlieb-says-us-delta-driven-covid-spike-could-peak-in-3-weeks-following-uk-pattern.html.)

The question for me becomes 3 weeks gets us close to September and then it's Fall/Winter not long after that. At this point I think my concern is whether this is going to be a long while of (cases subside, everyone thinks things are getting better, see earlier this year), ""psyche!""

66,IT," You are picking the wrong enemy, but don't let facts get in the way of your nanny state narrative.  If you are not vax and get covid 4 out of 5 exhibit symptoms. 

Getting vax does not 100% prevent covid.  It does however make most people who get it asymptomatic or only mildly symptomatic.  If they do contract it, then they often carry a very high viral load. Guess what that means?  Vax people are more likely to be super spreaders than non vax people. 

There doesn't have to be an enemy. It certainly doesn't have to be your fellow citizens. Do what you can to protect you and yours and that is all you can do. You step out of place when you go after the easy targets the media would have you to blame for our woes. 

The primary risk to non vax people is Covid. Let Darwin's law rule. 

The primary risk to vax people is most likely to be a breakthrough variant post delta that evolves in asymptomatic vax people due to the already demonstrated proclivity to be somewhat vax resistant.  

Quit being a puppet and educate yourself a bit. The media lies, and tells half truth and the sheeple blindly follow and hate on the object of the medias derision at that point in time. 

From the beginning this thing was going to have to work its way through the whole of humanity. Those that remain will have some sort of immunity, either boosted by vax or just that is how their body rolls.  It will either mutate and kill us all or die off.

Shares of Magnachip Semiconductor Corp. (MX) shot up 15.8% in premarket trading Friday, after the South Korea-based chipmaker confirmed that it received an unsolicited buyout bid representing a premium of more than 50%. The company said Cornucopia Investment Partners, on behalf of itself and a group of investors, has offered to buy all of Magnachip's outstanding shares for $35 in cash, which is 51.8% above Thursday's closing price of $23.05 and would value the company at about $1.66 billion. That would top the terms of the buyout agreement with South Dearborn Ltd. announced in March, in which Magnachip agreed to be acquired for $29.00 a share in cash. Magnachip said it will ""carefully review and consider"" Cornucopia's bid.

Do people not know what a moat is?  Their product is free trading yes?  There’s literally dozens of large competitors here with better products.  They have almost no moat. 

>and were first to market with an app where almost anyone can buy stocks right from their phone.

No, they weren’t.  Schwab, vanguard, fidelity, etrade, td, blah blah blah all had apps with trading before robinhood existed. 


Robinhoods competitive advantage is twofold:

1) they have managed to market themselves quite well to young inexperienced investors, to the point where a lot of people on Reddit seem to think they’re an industry leader when the realities are quite different

2) they were the first, and really still only one, to remove a ton of normal brokerage features in favor of a simple clean UI, and use this to attract people who found brokers and investing confusing. 

Primary business risks include: Their public image being quite poor after repeated high profile blunders, an ongoing cultural issue with compliance which has caused increased SEC, FINRA, SIPC, and state regulatory scrutiny, reductions in order flow revenue streams due to regulatory pressures, almost no NIM revenues to speak of, no AM business as well resulting in a very narrow revenue stream.

Like, those two may be enough to ensure continued growth, and perhaps those risks are properly mitigated, but if you’re gonna invest in the stock at least understand what their actual business strategy is.",MasterCookSwag,5,/r/investing/comments/oybj6j/hood_robinhood_is_a_large_cap/h7t0cr9/,0.07,0.825,0.105,0.8497

No, they weren’t.  Schwab, vanguard, fidelity, etrade, td, blah blah blah all had apps with trading before robinhood existed. 


Robinhoods competitive advantage is twofold:

1) they have managed to market themselves quite well to young inexperienced investors, to the point where a lot of people on Reddit seem to think they’re an industry leader when the realities are quite different

2) they were the first, and really still only one, to remove a ton of normal brokerage features in favor of a simple clean UI, and use this to attract people who found brokers and investing confusing. 

Primary business risks include: Their public image being quite poor after repeated high profile blunders, an ongoing cultural issue with compliance which has caused increased SEC, FINRA, SIPC, and state regulatory scrutiny, reductions in order flow revenue streams due to regulatory pressures, almost no NIM revenues to speak of, no AM business as well resulting in a very narrow revenue stream.

Like, those two may be enough to ensure continued growth, and perhaps those risks are properly mitigated, but if you’re gonna invest in the stock at least understand what their actual business strategy is.",MasterCookSwag,5,/r/investing/comments/oybj6j/hood_robinhood_is_a_large_cap/h7t0cr9/,0.07,0.825,0.105,0.8497

102,UI," > Their product is free trading yes?

Free trading with a UI that doesn't look like it was designed by a basement dweller around the battle of Waterloo.

Other companies have introduced free trading but if they're trying to update their user experience they've been failing so far and for so long.

I've bought and sold it a few times in the last week, i'll happily buy and hold it at $50ish.",assuasivedamian,2,/r/investing/comments/oybj6j/hood_robinhood_is_a_large_cap/h7t9fqf/,0.096,0.727,0.177,0.6752
103,RH," I mean, that's just a fundamental difference in priorities between new investors and more experienced ones.  I don't think their UI is very good, in fact I find it to be incredibly lacking in both functionality and features where as both my schwab and fidelity apps are quite useful, even though I prefer using a desktop site.  Newer investors aren't really as familiar with all of the different order types, up to date quoting, cost basis accounting, lots, etc so missing all of that on the app in favor of a cute swipe seems functional to them.  

I don't think one is necessarily better or worse than the other.  But I do think it's amusing that so many RH users tend to take some sort of hard stance that their UI is somehow better than others - when in reality they're just different UIs targeting very different demographics.",MasterCookSwag,2,/r/investing/comments/oybj6j/hood_robinhood_is_a_large_cap/h7ta7mx/,0.04,0.846,0.114,0.8812

105,NIM," Depends on where you derive your revenue from.  A broker like Schwab fundamentally has a different set of income streams from Robinhood.  

RH primarily gains income through selling order flow - so lots of small odd lot trades made by people who don't expect or know about price improvements.

Someone like Schwab gets some revenue from order flow, but their primary revenues come from NIM, advisory services, and fees derived from asset management of underlying funds, platform fees for third party funds, etc.  So they would prefer a client with more in assets who will be using a more broad set of products and services.  

Like, the type of investor who would use Robinhood is fundamentally not a desirable customer for most larger brokerages.  Robinhood doesn't necessarily care how small a customer is, only how much they trade - where as someone with like less than 50k generally isn't profitable (or is barely profitable) for most full service brokers.",MasterCookSwag,1,/r/investing/comments/oybj6j/hood_robinhood_is_a_large_cap/h7tsusa/,0.062,0.806,0.132,0.8742
