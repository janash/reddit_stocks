0,TSLA," TSLA has mastered the art of making money from non core business.

He's not afraid to take risks and ultimately, Tesla is reaping the awards and so will SpaceX. Does he make me nervous as a shareholder? Sure. But he's also given me 1000% gain on my investment. I wouldn't buy at current pricing but a lot of you are simply missing the point and are entirely focused on Musk rather than how the company is actually doing which in this case, has been booming.

3,TSLA," So, $438M in net income (GAAP) with $518M of that from credits and $101M from Bitcoin. 

Doing the math... $438M - $518M - $101M = -$181M loss. If you do the same thing for Q4 '20, their net loss was --$131M. They're actually getting **less profitable.**

People should be sincerely concerned to see rising profits based solely on rising credits and BTC shenanigans. The credits *will* run out someday as other carmakers bring out their own EVs and no longer need to purchase credits from TSLA. The BTC nonsense is just that - nonsense.

VW just bought quite a few of Tesla's credits and again, their system is getting stricter and automakers will have to buy more.

Jan 2001: 133.0  
Jan 2021: 296.4  
  
Okay. So let’s work backwards. The median home price right now is apparently $1.755m. Meaning in 2001, that price is $787.5k. Well, we’ve got to adjust for inflation. So $527k home price.
  
Let’s say 20% down so no PMI and a mortgage of $422k. Mortgage rates were 7.0% per Freddie Mac. So we’ve got $2,805 in mortgage per month. Plus the down payment of $105k. So your costs of just the home alone thus far over 20 years have been $105k + $673k for a total of $778k. 0.5% of original property value per year for maintenance + fees and remodels along the way and such so another $53k. Typical effective property tax rate in SF is 0.64%. I’m going to be lazy and say 1% of initial home price (shouts out prop 13 for being pretty close to this anyways), so another $105k in taxes.  
   
So $778k in house payments. $53k in maintenance and remodels and shit, $105k in property taxes all over the course of 20 years of ownership. So you’ve paid $936k all in.  
  
Your house is now worth $1.76m. Selling costs are like 6% so that’ll knock off a solid $105,600. You’re looking at around $1.65m, for an all in investment of $1.4m. that’s a return of $464k.  
  
If you had put that initial $105k in the sp500 in Jan 2001, and then $3,463 every month from then til Jan 2021.... you would have had $1.33m. If you chose to cash that all you’d face a 20% tax rate. You’d come away with $1.07m on a total investment of $936k. That’s $134k.  
   
Return after cashing out house: $464k

42,REAL," note on your calculation :   
Rule of thumb (completely) I've always taken mortgage to be about double the rent.  
It just a way of taking a first look at a property off the cuff - what's the rent? ..  about double.. or *almost* double .. that is the mortgage.   
p.s. when you are working out the cost of the mortgage over X years.. to be REAL you should deduct the rent you WOULD have paid to live somewhere for those X years  .. it's a real-life useful calculation to make - if you want to pay off your mortgage, sell up & and move. You should add in the ""unpaid rent"" as a saving, to see at what point (or if) you break even on the decision.

"" If you had put that initial $105k in the sp500 in Jan 2001, and then $3,463 every month from then til Jan 2021""

If you're paying rent, you're unlikely to have 3463 to put into the S&P 500 every month. 

The S&P 500 option means you really need to have rent + 3463 + living expenses in take home every month to make this happen 

If you're an average joe in SF in the 90s, you are not likely to have that.

49,TX," I see this a lot. The numbers, on average, do not prove this out. 
Again - average, which can be dangerous in real estate. Certain properties in certain places can be huge winners, and also, certain periods of time have rapid increase in prices. (We’re in one of those now)
On average, however, when one takes into account the problems of inflation, repairs, taxes, etc etc - real estate has something like a 3 - 5% real return over the last 100 years or so. (I know - hard to believe, even for me) again - averages.
If you can beat the average, in time and place, and not get unlucky with a bad renter or an earthquake or something, you will do much better....of course.

57,IRS," Read section at link below titled ""Unrecaptured Section 1250 Gain"". 25%, as the other poster said, is the tax rate of the recaptured gain.

[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/depreciationrecapture.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/depreciationrecapture.asp)

Copy/paste of the section:

""For example, consider a rental property that was purchased for $275,000 and has an annual depreciation of $10,000 ($275,000 / 27.5 years allowed by IRS for rental property). After 11 years, the owner decides to sell the property for $430,000. The adjusted cost basis then is $275,000 - ($10,000 x 11) = $165,000. The realized gain on the sale will be $430,000 - $165,000 = $265,000. The unrecaptured section 1250 gain can be calculated as $10,000 x 11 = $110,000, and the capital gain on the property is $265,000 - ($10,000 x 11) = $155,000.

Let’s assume a 15% [capital gains tax](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital_gains_tax.asp) and that the owner falls in the 32% [income tax bracket](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxbracket.asp) for 2019. Unrecaptured section 1250 gains are limited to 25% for 2019. The total amount of tax that the taxpayer will owe on the sale of this rental property is (0.15 x $155,000) + (0.25 x $110,000) = $23,250 + $27,500 = $50,750.

63,JPM," For what it's worth, despite many on Reddit saying it would be a wild guess, the idea of forecasting returns within a rough degree of accuracy is pretty well accepted in mainstream finance.  After all, the math of stock returns are basically similar to bonds except there is variability in the cashflow expectations.  Aside from that it's a function of yield, cashflows, and what price one will pay for those cashflows in the future.  All of which can be reasonably known or estimated - with future PE being the most difficult.  

If anyone's interested, JPMorgan releases their long term capital market assumptions yearly.  

https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/institutional/insights/portfolio-insights/ltcma/

These assumptions are forecasted over a 15 year timeframe, but realistically 20 isn't that far either so it would be a good starting point.  Their model suggests the following: 

US Inflation: 2.0%

US large cap: 4.1%

US Small Cap: 4.6%

US Inv Grade Bonds: 2.5%

Euro large cap:  6.6%

EAFE Equity: 6.5%

There's a bunch more, obviously, but those are some highlights.  I would encourage anyone who genuinely wants to absorb some information to read the [full report](https://am.jpmorgan.com/content/dam/jpm-am-aem/global/en/insights/portfolio-insights/ltcma/ltcma-full-report.pdf).  It's a bit long, but it's full of fantastic insights.

E: it should be noted that JPM isn't the only institution doing this - most banks release similar reports, even the fan favorite Vanguard has long term market assumptions that largely reflect these, and so did Jack Bogle before his passing.  The reason I mention it is to note that the idea of return forecasting isn't some sort of crazy complex finance marketing - it's just an execution of some basic macroeconomics and math.",MasterCookSwag,29,/r/investing/comments/mzn9py/what_do_you_think_broad_market_returns_will/gw2hafy/,0.024,0.872,0.104,0.9683

1. In no other country is executive *and* employee compensation tied so heavily to the performance of the company's stock. Hats off to American companies, they have got incentives down to a science. I have full faith that the CEO all the way down to entry-level employees are working together when their goals are aligned with mine as an investor. The fact that software engineers straight out of college are getting paid partially in RSU's should be every investor's wet dream.

The rest is history. As long as the US can continue to attract these people with ease, growth and innovation will never cease.

3. North-American hyper-consumerism. This is just a no-brainer. In addition, American culture permeates through ""nouveau-riche"" countries like in the Middle East or South East Asia and that hyper-consumerism comes with it. At this point, I think companies like Apple could slap their logo on just about anything, make it *f a n c y* and people would still buy it. There truly seems to be no end to what people will rationalize they must have. It's mind-boggling but hey; buy, buy, buy means stock price goes up, up, up. 

4. Government spending. While consumption generates the majority of growth, government spending is a solid second place. I don't know about you guys but when I look at Biden's proposals all I see is dollar signs left, right and center, particularly because Biden is pushing to ""Buy American"". At the same time, take a look at what politicians hold in their own personal portfolios. Billions of dollars worth of American stock held collectively. Are we honestly going to believe that they are going to do what's ""right"" (like breaking up big US tech) when it could jeopardize their constituents' retirements and more importantly, their personal wealth? They will put on a show to pretend like they're doing something but ultimately I bet it will lead to a whole lot of nothing. 


5. The Federal Reserve and MMT. The biggest reason of them all to be bullish on the American stock market. At this point, it's almost as if the stock market is a baby born to helicopter parents. The *moment* it even thinks about crying, in swoops Powell with printer (baby bottle) in hand. Biden, Pelosi and Yellen sprint across the room ready to pass stimulus and government spending laws (plush toys and rattles). It is almost comical the lengths that they are willing to go to keep the stock market up. They have learned from the past: spend, spend, spend, spend and don't stop spending until growth comes back with a vengeance. As an investor, I feel like there have never been so many people in my corner, particulary when investing in the US. During the Great Depression if you lost your life savings in the stock market, well, too bad. It was risky. Now it almost feels like you can't lose.

6.

For example, CD PROJECT has hyped their Cyberpunk game into the skies. Large stock growth, people investing money by masses.

Now Cyberpunk comes out and it's a broken mess. Pre-orders are good and the game makes some sick money, but the controversy and complains are huge and the stock market value tanks.

Now the company purposefully stretches out the process of fixing the game and turns silent, almost never talking about progress. Stock holders slowly give up on holding and sell their units at a loss. The COVID pandemic crisis has probably scared even more stock holders into selling at a loss (CD Project has planned the pandemic all along! /s)

Once company is satisfied with the numbers, they start pushing out their work and maybe pump out a couple DLCs, the game becomes what it was advertised and people start buying the product, DLCs and the stock again.

The company has made money on pre-orders, DLCs, and also have cashed in the profit from the stocks that they sold for higher than they bought back.

Buy some shares in BX or KKR.  BX blew out their recent earnings with great numbers across the board and their fixed fees also benefit from the general inflow of cash.

127,IMO," It makes sense actually.

Illiquid assets have better value. Market crash will affect overvalued assets, that's OP thesis IMO and I agree. Because they are less speculative because illiquid.

For exemple if the FED raise rates anything with a high PER will crash, but low PER won't. I personally hold nothing with a PER above 10 at the moment for that reason.",Fruity_Pineapple,0,/r/investing/comments/mzjbfi/how_to_get_into_private_equity/gw39hsl/,0.098,0.76,0.142,-0.0507
