13,RH," “Dark pool” is a sinister name for something pretty ordinary. Institutional investors typically hide size by trading in a dark pool but not price. All the prices are derived from the “lit” exchanges so it’s not like a dark pool is the Wild West where traders are trading at whatever price they want. Secondly, all trades that occur in a dark pool are reported to a Trade Reporting Facility either at Nasdaq or NYSE which are then reported to the SIP, for all investors to view. A dark pool isn’t particularly scandalous and trades that occur there are fully transparent.

Also, I’m old enough to remember paying 10 bucks a trade on TD Ameritrade. Commission free trading for the retail investor is because of the much maligned payment for order flow. Payment for order flow isn’t particularly scandalous either and I’ve written another long explanation on the practice. Basically, because retail flow is uninformed regarding short term price movements and uncorrelated, a market maker like citadel securities can earn the spread on retail volume without the risk of adverse selection. They can also improve execution for their other strategies by buying/selling passively at the near price. Certainly there is a volume threshold at which 10 bucks is cheap relative to 1 or 2 tick slippage, but I doubt retail investors are trading at that size.

Other than that, I agree that because of retail internalization by citadel, virtu, etc., order flow that hits lit exchanges tends to be more toxic, but that affects precisely none of you trading here via RH or TD or whatever. 

I also agree that PhD’s are hired to game financial markets but there is a TON of money in it so I can’t really blame them. I got into this industry because I have technical skills and want to make a ton of money. All that providing liquidity and social good explanation is bullshit.

If you did not have location services and tracking enabled on Google, and you'd type ""indian food"" in Google Maps while looking at a map of Brooklyn NY, it would show you results in fucking New Zealand or South Africa and prompt you again to enable location tracking. 

Fucking shits thought they were being clever when all it did was make people (like me) resent them; even with location turned off, you can see that the request is coming in from a Brooklyn IP (and at least an NY one, and most definitely at least a US one). Still gets me fired up lol.

122,OCGN," I picked up OCGN at .25 on 6/1/20


Edit 

After thinking about this more. The main reason I bought it was pure speculation and the fact that the stock price dropped about 60-80% in one day. Got a warning for delisting so that right there is enough incentive to get the stock price above $1 (minimum price for regulatory listing approval) so possibly losing a few bucks on the chance it will  go from .25->1+ was a 65/35 in my book. Even if for a matter of 1 week, where the stock demand was pumped to get the price to close at 1+ for a week or more, was enough incentive for me to buy into a company that had a decent cash reserve and other orphan drug designations in its portfolio. Only risk was if it came April/May and the price was still sub $1.

190,GME," I got in at 10.22. Wasn’t expecting it to bounce like this though. Honestly was a long term hold for me. They aren’t even profitable right now. I just had them as a speculation hoping for an acquisition. Figured maybe they would get up to $20 a share and I’d sell. Spiked so fast I never even had a chance to look at why. Just saw today that WSB was main catalyst. Was hoping it was news of a buyout. Personally I have no interest in adding more at this price point. Sold half my shares at $24 so what I have left is free money. I’ll hold and hope for the moon. I have been moving my stop loss up though. I set it at $1.5 below value. I’m afraid that when it starts to tank, it will fall pretty quickly. It’s a 4 rating on tip ranks with 1 hold. No buys. No sells. Stock news gives it an F ranking and reports that their revenue is down 1065% since December 3rd 2020. It has just eclipsed its 52 week high though and money is money. Doesn’t matter what the catalyst is. In this case it seems mostly due to WSB but that’s not a bad thing. Fundamentals don’t matter if the price keeps going up. WSB is its own catalyst. Look what happened with GME. Terrible fundamentals yet it went up over 1000% and is still trading $100 higher than it was before WSB got hold of it.

The 5K cash stash and a desire (but procrastination) to open a Fidelity has been burning a seriously hole in my pocket!!! I’m busy enough at work to not die from fomo but DAMN. 

I do have a heavy E*TRADE portfolio.. but E*TRADE is for my long term investments since my smooth brain don’t know how to move anything around in that platform anyway. Lol.   Might wire the 5K there for MVIS 😂.        I don’t even know if E*TRADE even let you trade a stock twice in one day. Or if there’s a 5 trades per month “you don’t have a daytrader approval” limit.

There are plenty of companies with products that achieve the same purpose as what IVY is meant to achieve, and have been doing it for longer  Microsoft, Google, Otonomo - not to mention some OEMs like Tesla build their vehicle data platforms & analytics in house.

IVY won't ship in physical cars until 2023, whilst other players like Otonomo are already in cars - over 20mn, and that figure was from 2020.

518,GME," I agree there’s a correlation that can by analyzed with Elliot wave theory, but you should know well enough now to understand that GME is not a normal stock and doesn’t function within the bounds of widely accepted theories or analysis. 

That being said, this increase was carefully constrained by someone out there. Look at the 168.5 level and how many times it was hit and brought back down. There’s an Elliot there, and a ratio could probably be found after a few rough calculations. Also, if you watched it real-time you’d notice as SOON as it hit 168.5 it dropped IMMEDIATELY to 168.41 EVERY TIME until it finally broke through. 

So I agree you could possibly use Elliot theory to  predict the future because whoever is constraining the price to not move too high too fast is kinda forcing it that way (either because that’s the best they can use what they have or cause that’s the design they’re used to), but I wouldn’t hang too much on to it.

529,GME," TBH, im not literate enough to explain how margin calls play together, but I'll do my best from my knowledge. 
Margin call, in this case, is applied when your broker notices a deficient value in your holdings. Meaning you bit more than what you can chew. That was at the discretion of the player. What we should be doing is analyze the greeks in the calls (more here) and puts and see where the brokers are moving their money towards to. 
Elliot waves can help confirm movement from a random and chaotic manner (in which GME is a good example because its all over the place)
Yes, we need to close well above $350 to confirm Wave 3 and if not, the recount of waves needs to be done again. Looking back in Feb, it broke through 350 several times (which is  good!) however, more recently, it did find resistance as you stated which now is the target price.

You will need vision in any case so vision is a sunk cost, LIDAR is a variable that you can save money if you can skip it.

As to LIDAR in vehicles, well you are essentially betting that Elon Musk and Tesla are fundamentally wrong here, because if they are right, then everyone will drop LIDAR as quick as they can, because it is an extra unnecessary cost.

562,AR," Please explain how AR will make construction go quicker?? A person that is working in construction should know how to read drawings and do not need AR for them to conceptualize how something is to be built. They already have that technology and it is called BIM. BIM even has its problems and causes change orders all the time because of coordination issues. These goggles will only cause a safety hazard to the skilled workers that are building it. Can you imagine all of the OSHA fines and lawsuits that will come from this when the first accident happens. The root of the problem is bringing in young quality workers and keeping experienced workers that are good at their craft. That will make things go quicker. A good team of workers in the field make a job go quicker and under budget. This technology is only viable for a developer who wants to show potential clients what the space would look like before it is finished. But good luck selling that to a developer that is already trying to undercut every contractor for labor and materials.

I’ve Worked in construction for 10 years and own a small construction company. Small and medium size contractors couldn’t afford this. Large GC’s have only a few people testing this technology but it wouldn’t translate into the field (built) environment. It would only be in the office environment which doesn’t make the actual work go faster and more cost efficient. If they can perfect BIM it will make the jobs go smoother for the project managers, estimators, and Superintendents. Which would make for a smoother project without a lot of change orders. But there are always change orders because clients always want to make changes so it ends up being more work for the architects and more coordinating with subcontractors and vendors",Jgaston11,-5,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mykdxp/microvision_is_the_future/gvvkg05/,0.022,0.89,0.088,0.9682

If your thesis is based on MSFT you should be worried. MVIS earned a total of $3M revenue in 2020. If MSFT is indeed their only customer, MSFT thinks they’re worth $3M a year. 
 
From 10-K. Apes are positive that MSFT is the “April 2017 customer” welp 

The decrease in contract revenue during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 was attributed to decreased contract activity because the contract with our April 2017 customer was completed in 2019. **Our contract backlog, including orders for prototype units and evaluation kits, at December 31, 2020 and 2019 was zero.**


The decrease in product revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 was primarily due to reduced product shipments to a major technology company. Beginning in the third quarter of 2019 and through the end of February 2020, we were selling components to a high definition display system that we developed for a customer under a development agreement. **The volume and resulting revenue and gross profit from this business was fairly low.** Therefore, in March 2020 we transferred production of the components to the customer.

606,MVIS," You’re essentially gambling that on 5/28, the price will be $40 or higher. Usually people sell contracts before the expiration date, unless they have the cash to exercise the option (1 option is a contract for 100 shares). If the price is higher than your strike price (ie. $40), then the owner of the contract can exercise that option to buy 100 shares of the respective stock at the strike price. For example if MVIS is at $50 on 5/28 and he exercises the option, then he will buy 100 shares at the price of $40 each; immediately making roughly $1000 (minus the premium, the price you paid for the contract). Granted this could all change depending on what the stock does after acquiring.

So tell me, how many LIDAR sensors like this would you need in a car? If the cost of buying and installing such a system runs $1,000, if you have two of them that is going to cost you $2,000... Well don't forget, you also need cameras because vision and all that can't be avoided. So let's do some math... if you are planning on selling 10M cars a year and you can save $1,000 per car, that comes to... $10B in profit per year. If you need two sensors and you can save now $2,000 per car, that is $20B in profits.

Even if each car had one sensor at a cost of $750, if that is an unnecessary cost in 10M cars that is $7.5B in profits. It is really hard for me to conceive of any situation, where if this cost can be avoided, automakers do not do their best to exclude it.

I have no position in MVIS (traded some calls last week.. nothing significant) currently. Like I said short-term stocks can go all different ways. I was mainly offering that anyone considering investing long-term in this should consider the bear case here.

From my standpoint Tesla and MVIS are way different types of companies. Tesla makes a product whereas MVIS licenses it’s technologies. Their technology is behind the Microsoft Hololens. Even their A-Sample they’re working on now isn’t exactly a “product”. 

I’m not familiar with the company pre 2010’s but I’m also not sure that’s relevant to today’s company, but when have they received billions in funding?",randomfunnyword,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mykdxp/microvision_is_the_future/gvxvutg/,0.06,0.94,0.0,-0.546

645,DD, I guess you can say that if you want to ignore the revenue they are making for being inside the Microsoft Hololens and all of their job postings right now that clearly point towards a ramp up in production. To some extent you are right about the echo chamber phenomenon. At some point you have to take the facts of what is happening and draw your own conclusions. If you truly do your DD you will find there are too many moving parts to toss this up as coincidence. You can Google all you want and nobody will announce that a buyout is imminent. That’s simply not how this works. You won’t get those sorts of query results until the buyout is officially announced. The reason why the echo chamber exists is because people like me have to spell out common sense to people like you. Feel free to sit this one out while I continue to make thousands.

Traditional movie theater competition is shrinking while streaming competition is growing.  Some people believe that streaming will replace/exceed traditional competition.  I'm betting that long term streaming competition is not as bad as many think.  All AMC has to do to gain market share is survive.  

Why do I think this?  Not a very good reason but.... I rarely watch movies at home or the theater.  I much much much prefer the theater though.  If the kids wake up the babysitter can handle it.

1217,AMD," $AMD is pegged to 10x P/S, if they meet expectations and Lisa Su reiterates 37% growth, their fair value should be around $91.50 (with a Year end target of $113) so I expect there to be a run up to that amount before earnings.  Lisa Su tends to be conservative in her guidance, so you may want to sell before earnings, or hedge your bets here.  However, I believe she'll guide much higher, considering all the rumors of extra Wafer capacity at TSMC, to as high as 80% extra capacity at 7nm, due to Apple jumping to 5nm early \[[https://www.notebookcheck.net/AMD-overtakes-Apple-as-TSMC-s-main-7nm-customer.528532.0.html](https://www.notebookcheck.net/AMD-overtakes-Apple-as-TSMC-s-main-7nm-customer.528532.0.html)\]; so if you're a betting person, you'll hold onto your calls, especially if they're already ITM, because I'm expecting AMD to go stratospheric!

Vast majority of my 5/7 Calls are ITM, ranging from $75 to $82, but I also have a bunch of cheap $100 lotto Calls as well, I'm planning to keep all my Calls past earnings, since I'm expecting $91.50 to be the absolute floor.

1220,AMD, I think the big difference here compared to the past that many are missing is the indications in Intel's earning call that AMD was cutting into them hard.. The big thing that has been keeping AMD in check is that they were against two titans (Intel and Nvidia) in their primary markets (CPU & GPU). They have have knocked one of those titans out of the box and are quickly closing the gap on the other. The 11th generation Intel chips have been slammed hard by the press and customers simply aren't excited about their offerings anymore. When their main competitor can't even manage to outperform AMD's last gen offering that puts them in a great place. This stock is poised to rally hard. Not financial advice I just like the stock.

In the days of Opteron, it all felt very similar, only for Intel to come roaring back and crush all the inroads AMD was finally making in the datacenter/server space.

Although, this is very different now, and it's not going to turn out the same way.

As to the rest, I'm not sure I agree as your premise seems to be that if someone doesn't have an insider's amount of knowledge regarding the CMBS market, they don't have the ability to read and understand **research by people who do.** 

That's like saying ""you can't understand a newspaper article unless you're a journalist."" It's just not true, IMO. 

I read the Griffin study cover to cover. It's the exact type of research you're saying people should do to understand this. Well, why do I need to do the research myself if an expert has already done it and concluded this shit is shaddy?

1343,CLF," It all depends on how long you plan on holding it. Cemex isn't going away.  They're a top global distributor of cement and so America's infrastructure spending alone won't be as impactful on CX as it is on CLF.  CLF is a great domestic stock and so responds more favorably to domestic spending.  For day traders CX has enough volatility that getting in and out can be profitable, and for those holding long, it has enough sustained growth that I don't have to worry about it too much. However, it does have periods of sharp and quick decline followed by slow recovery. Depending on how you look at that, it could be a blessing or a curse. If your goal is to put this in your portfolio and come back in 25 years expecting a fortune, that might not be the case. Those periods of sharp decline followed by slow recovery are a blessing for those who can come up with decent capital but just need a few days to do it. The stock is very forgiving in that way. You don't need to be some dickhead with a ton of cash catching the dips. 

Overall I like CX a lot, it's one of the better performing and maintenance free stocks in my portfolio.  If you're trying to ride the infrastructure wave, it's good to have some $CLF, $CX, $CAT, and $CLMT.

1647,AA," Storytime

A few years ago I transferred to a new “automation” group that was building robots. It was 6 months in and they were using Blue Prism. After another 6 months in, I was the resident technical expert as I was one of the few that actually had a programming background.
