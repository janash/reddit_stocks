29,NAK," In September 2020, the Environment Investigation Agency (an international NGO that investigates and campaigns against environmental crime and abuse) released recordings in which NAK executives secretly revealed that the company intended the Pebble Project to be far bigger than publicly represented.

The people from the EIA posed as potential investors in the mine and conducted zoom calls in which NAK executives detailed how they sought to curry favor with Alaskan senators and the Trump's white house chief of staff.  

NAK currently has a class action lawsuit on their hands *FROM THEIR OWN INVESTORS* for making false/misleading statements about the Pebble Project vis a vis Clean Water Act guidelines and project size and duration. 

Northern Dynasty and it's former CEO, who resigned in September after being recorded on said zoom calls, have been served subpoenas in relation to a grand jury investigation apparently involving the recordings of the private conversations.
