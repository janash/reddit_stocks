0,IQ," As far as what she could've done differently, history suggests that there's little she could've done except endure the inevitable downturn that has been unfolding, or otherwise be a hypocrite and switch her fund strategies as things ran too hot. 

Here's an excerpt from *The Intelligent Investor*:

> So, if a fund beats the market, our intuition tells us to expect it to keep right on outperforming. Unfortunately, in the financial markets, luck is more important than skill. If a manager happens to be in the right corner of the market at just the right time, [they] will look brilliant---but all too often, what was hot suddenly goes cold and the manager's IQ seems to shrivel by 50 points. [...] The market's hottest market sector---in 1999, that was technology---often turns as cold as liquid nitrogen, with blinding speed and utterly no warning. [...] Financial scholars have been studying mutual-fund performance for at least a half century, and they are virtually unanimous on several points:

> [...] 3. the more frequently a fund trades its stocks, the less it tends to earn;

> [...] 5. funds with high past returns are unlikely to remain winners for long.

Open- and closed-end mutual funds are a bit different than the ARK actively-managed ETFs, but the principle is the same: When a fund or sector vastly outperforms, it is unlikely to keep outperforming; and the more it outperforms, the more likely it is to lose what it gained. Because our intuition tells us that past performance is indicative of future performance by implicit extrapolation of a trend, when the inevitable down turn happens, people are disappointed.",Peshhhh,18,/r/stocks/comments/ndbsx8/trying_to_understand_the_ark_fund_backlash/gya8hv9/,0.047,0.913,0.04,-0.4569

3,ATH," Some of the angers or hates are justified and some are not:

Justified hates are from investors who focus on fundamental and sensible valuations who have been ridiculed, made fun of last year when ARKK had a massive bull run. Everywhere I went on Reddit last year, it was all about ""growth"", and ""value investing is dead."" Lots of value investors basically kept their mouths shut last year and they only started opening their mouth this year with ""I told you so."" 

Some of the unjustified hates and angers are from new investors who bought ARKK near the peaks or at ATH, expecting the fund will keep generating 80% returns in the next 3 years and they ended up being bag holders for this fund with no prospect of recuperate the 30% losses. Sorry Jose, that's not how investing works. Anything outperforming will eventually revert to the mean.

Some people are also not a fan of Cathie Woods for some reasons we don't need to understand. It's like somebody hating Steve Jobs and Apple for apparently no good reasons.",VanguardSucks,5,/r/stocks/comments/ndbsx8/trying_to_understand_the_ark_fund_backlash/gyaymrg/,0.163,0.748,0.089,-0.9234
4,COIN," Active fund management is about taking profit when a stock is overvalued and rotating to less risky assets -- you're essentially paying the management fee for the manager to manage your money by timing the market better than you. She did well during 2020 by selling TSLA/SQ/ROKU for a lot of profit and generating new momentum in stocks like PACB for even more profit. She hasn't done well in 2021 however.

The first issue with ARK is that Cathie knew a correction was coming but did not act on it. She dumped the less bubbly stocks like GOOG for more bubbly ones early during the start of the crash and amplified the losses for her investors which is the opposite of what she should be doing. The second issue is that she then proceeds to sell those bubbly stocks for an even lower price (most prominent example is WKHS). It works if the stocks eventually meet her extremely high price targets, but if they don't, she will keep looking like an idiot.

Other issues I have with her is that she markets her fund as a 5-year hold but rotates in and then completely out of companies within weeks like a clueless chicken without profit — just holding would have generated lower trading fees. 

She is also fond of initiating long positions at the worst prices (eg COIN, PATH) and be stuck holding bags. Do I really need to pay the annual fee for somebody to buy high?

Her fund has performed well relative to SPY but considering the risk level and tech focus, you have to compare it with leveraged QQQ instead. Then she looks less impressive.

10,TSLA," Maybe a more behaviouralist take: 

The issue with a lot of her funds is that the growth in many of the companies they have positions in (which are large positions) has been caused by flows into the fund. Fund performs well, ARKK puts more money in ARKK holdings, ARKK holdings go up, other investors invest in those stocks, ARKK performs better - its cyclical. This is known as the momentum phenomenon, and most of growth tech has been seeing a lot of it this year. Unfortunately, in environments like this (inflation as a huge concern - I did a breakdown [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SmartChicksMakeBank/comments/ndqh5a/inflation_is_it_that_bad_why_it_matters_and_what/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)) growth tech tends to not perform so well, meaning people take money out of ARKK holdings, ARKK share price falls - **and then people start pulling money out of ARKK.** 

The issue is that a lot of ARKK holders were holders because the fund was doing well. When it stopped doing well, they took the money out. So that same cycle that brought the ETF up on the way up is now pushing it down on the way down... positive feedback loops are bad, kids. 

Oh, also there's [this](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ark-invest-cathie-wood-bill-hwang/ark-invest-ceo-wood-says-hwang-provided-seed-capital-for-first-four-etfs-idUSKBN2CO21I) \- Archegos guy (the one that blew up) provided seed funding for ARKK and three of the other flagship funds. So, that might explain something about the crazy price targets on TSLA and others, given Bill was holding deep OTM calls on those.

The amount of money that has been poured into stocks with barely any revenue or not even a proven products yet is insane. Look at DASH (one of ARK's picks) having barely 1B in revenue being valued at almost 50B... That's insane, even for a high-growth stock.

18,AI," I’ll counter by saying that their initial price target was absolutely moronic too, until they exceeded it. So I’d be hesitant to act like it’s “absolutely moronic.” It’s okay to disagree and think it’s unrealistic, but acting like it’s legitimately impossible is surreal considering they’ve literally met similarly superlative price targets literally within the past year. 

Overall, ARK publishes a lot of material regarding their projections with TSLA and autonomous driving/EV/AI. 

TSLA could literally be THE autonomous car company. They could make every single autonomous driving vehicle on the market and be the only legitimate player in the game since they get an order of magnitude more driving data than everybody else - and ARK has stated many times that autonomous driving is just AI and AI is based on the data that you have. That adds an immense amount to its valuation targets by 1) selling more cars 2) being able to charge subscriptions for autonomous driving 3) being able to run the taxi/food delivery/transportation game. Imagine the entire cost of the trucking industry, and TSLA replacing that. Imagine the entire cost of the mobile food delivery and taxi industries and TSLA replacing that.

More down to earth, ARK just forecasts that EVs will cost less than ICE vehicles within the next few years, resulting in a complete migration of buyers from ICE to EV, which will skyrocket TSLA sales rather than result in incremental increases. That’s part of the valuation too.

Then you get into TSLA’s solar panel aspects, and it’s ability to basically raise as much capital as it could ever want given it’s current valuation. Then add into the inability and lack of innovation of traditional manufacturers and TSLA’s valuation makes more sense. 

I personally disagree with ARK and agree that TSLA is probably overvalued and will not meet the price targets set over the next few years, but I’m not going to act like it’s impossible because 1) they’ve already accomplished similar things literally as recent as this year by meeting a price target literally nobody thought was possible for them a few years ago and 2) ARK has been pretty clear about what they expect to happen for TSLA to meet the price target and it’s not “landing on Mars” it’s more stuff that it already dominates in like the EV market, autonomous, solar, etc.",PersonalBrowser,2,/r/stocks/comments/ndbsx8/trying_to_understand_the_ark_fund_backlash/gybxe8e/,0.038,0.874,0.088,0.9639

61,USA," >Do you believe clean energy will experience more adoption in the future? How long will it take?

I'm not sure. As of now, it's mostly been a lip service around the world. Major countries like Russia, Brazil, USA etc. still keep pursuing fossil fuel sources, while countries like Germany don't seem to using fossil fuel and becoming carbon neutral any time soon, at least not until 2045, and that's a long ass time. The whole world seem quite pretentious about it and very little progress has been made.

>Can you wait that long? Is there something else you'd rather be invested in?

I would have waited 4-5 years if I could be convinced that it will produce results, but I can't wait 30 years and I doubt that's practical at all. I have other options like IHI where I could invest more.

For example, if you (like DeepFucking Value) bought GME at $4 a share. The stock going to $400+ was the squeeze of a lifetime. It was a x100 return on investment.

If you bought GME at $300+ however (as most late entrants did) then the squeeze **did not happen**, because you didn't get anything, or at least not the x10 you were told was possible. You were cheated, robbed, there was a conspiracy against you by the hedge funds, the media...whoever... so now you sit in r/gme or r/superstonk wrapping your brain in more and more tinfoil till you believe $10m a share is a realistic valuation...

99,IMO," I expect a correction by the end of the year, and if not, at least a short bear market that ends up being roughly equivalent to a correction. There are numerous red flags floating around, from hyped-up new retail investors overextending into speculative assets from *[coins of a digital nature]* (up to 100x leverage available which is terrifying) to companies (and even entire sectors) that have never turned a profit, overzealous promoting of the market by institutions that signals a feed off of FOMO from last year's massive 1-year return, record high margin debt, record high IPOs over the last 2 years, and the impression that no matter what you buy, it will work out in the long run (no price is too high, stonks only go up, HODL ad infinitum). All this in light of the fact that the global economy just took and continues to endure its most serious hit since 2008, which doesn't add up to me. It's playing to trends and euphoric expectations, and that has never, not once, ended well for the average joe in the relative short term (1-2 years).

120,GDP," That's a absolutely valid pick up, but I had problem to find a such thing like ""US companies’ percentage of world GDP"", or rather some factor which consists of US GDP plus foreign revenues. I take that into consideration so I mostly look at pace change.

So in 2020 total US market capitalization was over 50% of world GDP, when United States' share of global gross domestic product (GDP) was like 16%.
With projected world GDP for 2021 as 6% rise and US market evaluation on March 31st 2021 is stopped rising (55%), but that's pure guessing.

138,CD," I am not a tax expert, so this will be confusing for me to explain.

But I computed it both ways.  In this case under 65 with a 4% return is \~$40k a year income in the first year.  Money is kept in a managed savings account, like a wealth builder account at a Bank.  (good luck getting 4% in a CD or Savings product)

Over 65 that money can be in an IRA, and no taxes are paid on the interest, instead taxes are paid when money is drawn from the account.  In the example case of a 36k draw down, taxes would be paid on 36k

This is paid on the regular marginal tax rate.

Capital gains is paid on appreciation of assets, for example real estate, or stock trades lasting longer than a year.

A lot matters how and where you keep your money.  But on this example of a million dollars, I feel like, in real life we would have to look at the situation.  

For example dividends are taxed one way, and qualified dividends are taxed a different way.  

But again, I am probably splitting hairs for the purposes of this conversation.

Just know you pay regular people taxes with the income generated from a million dollars, and your tax rate increases significantly when living off the income from about $1,5 million dollars onward.

You have one million. Put it in VTSAX. Have vanguard take out 3400 a month (adjusted for inflation) and it goes directly into your bank account, spend it. 

This money will not be taxed if it’s your only income. You won’t have capital gains taxes on it, you won’t have SS taxes, you won’t have Medicare taxes, and in most states you won’t have any state income tax.

191,ANY," So first off: good job saving! In the long run, continuing to contribute to your portfolio is going to matter more than what you invest in.

That said, I think 75% in individual stocks - in ANY individual stocks! - is taking a huge amount of risk for little guaranteed return. It’s **absolutely appropriate** for a 19-year old to take more risk than someone near retirement, but you want to be **compensated** for that risk.

Consider [this portfolio](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=4&startYear=1985&firstMonth=1&endYear=2021&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=1&annualAdjustment=10000&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=1&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&reinvestDividends=true&showYield=true&showFactors=false&factorModel=3&portfolioNames=false&portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&symbol1=IVV&allocation1_1=100) which involved contributing $10k / year (not adjusted for inflation) and just yeeting it all into IVV, the S&P 500.  The returns between 2000-2021 were fantastic, and someone with this portfolio made huge amounts of money while taking much less risk than anyone invested in individual stocks.

I’m not saying “Don’t invest in individual stocks”, but you should **have a plan that limits your exposure**. The thought experiment is this: Assume you are the worst stock-picker in the world. Assume every individual pick you make is gonna go to zero. How much of your portfolio will you be OK with losing? If that amount is less than 75%, then **limit your individual stock picks to that percentage**. Put the rest in a broad-based market index, like VTI. Profit.

You should also plan to revisit your investment plan every few years. Let’s say (I’m making up a number) that as a 19 year old, you’re ok losing 50% of your portfolio on individual stock picks, on the off chance one of them hits pay dirt.  When you’re 25, it’s possible that your tolerance for losing on your individual picks may have dropped; adjust the percentage of your portfolio in any individual stock accordingly.",peterb12,0,/r/stocks/comments/ndq2ig/how_am_i_doing/gycl95u/,0.093,0.797,0.11,0.634

Two things to add: 

1. ***Diversification***: If you're all in on growth tech, you had a really bad time these last few months. If you had a reasonably built portfolio, not so much, a few of your holdings may have seen a bit of pain but that's about it, others would have done well to compensate. **If you're building a portfolio look at commodities, bonds, REITs, and diversify across geographies and sectors for christsake.** 
2. ***Volatility***: There's risk and there's volatility. They are not the same. If you hold a stock like PLTR which has a monthly standard deviation of about 10%, don't be surprised when it goes up or down 10% in a month. That's normal and expected. It's still something to consider, but you should be prepared for it because it happens all the time. That is a wildly different situation from the risk that eg., the Chinese government starts taking regulation seriously all of a sudden, cancels your subsidiary's IPO, forces you to reclassify them and pay fines out the nose, and so on, causing the stock to fall 40% (looking at BABA). This is neither normal nor expected mathematically speaking, but definitely something you should think about as a source of risk.

Originally they predicted Time Warner and NBC should merge, but either way this is a win win for $T holders. They GREATLY reduce their debt (which has held down the stock for years) allowing them to save an ass-ton on interest payments while creating a powerhouse streaming service that takes arguably THE best TV series (Game of Thrones, Sopranos, etc...) and combines it with the most watched reality TV series in the country and puts it under one roof. $T would obviously own the majority of the stake which only bodes well for $T's future.

Or, they could see HBO Max as their big growth engine, in which case this is a decision to focus more resources on that.

298,RH," Pro is that you use leverage and can increase your returns since you can buy more but it’s not all your money.

Con is that if things don’t go the way you think they will, you can get a margin call and either have to deposit more money into the account (which you may or may not be able to do at that time), and if you can’t they can sell some of yourself positions to raise the cash needed.

And just like it can magnify your gains, it can magnify your losses.

Part of the reason RH is offering it to you is because they’ll charge you interest on any portion of the margin that you’re using and can make money from you that way.

For someone who is new to investing (and frankly for the vast majority of retail investors), it’s probably best to stay away from trading on margin.",NativeTxn7,22,/r/stocks/comments/ndw3uz/trying_to_understand_the_pros_and_cons_of_buying/gycyavb/,0.021,0.872,0.107,0.9354
299,ANY," Margin will magnify your wins or losses. This can be good or bad obviously. 

Brokers charge interest for margin loans, roughly 10% per year, so dont be buying with the intention to hold long term. Check your broker for exact %.

301,AAPL," Sure, here is what I know.

1. In general, buy low and sell when you retire, or get insider knowledge and learn to avoid the SEC. 5% corrections happen four times a year, 5-10% corrections happen about once a year, and 10-20% corrections happen every 18months or so. The entire world will feel like it is falling apart and the end of capitalism is near; so don't sell, just smile and push all your chips in... unless you own small caps and meme stocks, in which case you deserve to panic sell and take your losses.
2. Your initial strategy should be buying sp500 large cap ETFs and whole market ETFs every month, and loading up on dips with your extra cash. This is most people's retirement strategy to be honest. As you get into it more and more, you might buy some calls or puts, or specific stocks you feel strongly about.
3. You will get a feel for how low is low enough once you watch a few dips. Many of the 3-5% corrections are just because the market over reacted and is cooling off, or Yellen said something about inflation. The 10-20% moves are usually coupled to fed rate hikes, over valuation fears, real inflation, or a couple quarters of less than desirable economic data and people start to fear a recession...or a combination of these factors. Most recessions don't get below -35%, so once we get close to these numbers all chips go in. 
4. Small caps usually do best coming out of recessions, so dump into small cap etfs once the selling slows, after six months of so of recovery, shift back to large caps and blue chips. Small caps also do worse during recessions, and worse after recoveries, so don't hold them for long. Look at the green energy bag holders on this sub (ICLN) - that should be enough proof. 
5. Tech grows fast, but is dependent on fed interest rates. If rates go up, tech panic sells off. More dip buying potential for nice rebound plays.
6. Dont fight the fed. Once the fed starts quantitative easing, the market goes up, so be invested. Once the printing stops, overvaluation and inflation fears correct the market, so be ready for a 10-20% move down. ""Be ready"" means move all your extra cash into the account, pick your stocks and ETFs, and be ready for the move up or down. ""Extra cash"" means everything other than money needed for your car payment, rent, and ramen - dump the girlfriend or boyfriend. 
7. ETFs are easiest unless you have intimate knowledge AND like to invest as a hobby. This doesn't mean only buy VOO, you can buy etfs for specific industries, but you will need to pay closer attention to the markets and move cash around as necessary.
8. Dividend stocks suck. Dividends get smaller and smaller as the years go on. Dont do it.
9. By the time you hear about ""it"" on CNBC, FOX, or CNN it is too late, don't jump on the band wagon. 
10. I had something about a rabbit and a turtle, and wise words to encourage mediocrity that somehow amounts to excellence over time, but clearly that is so stupid I forgot. Get as much money into the market as you can on dips when you are young. Full-on 100% everything in. The proof is in a compounding interest calculator, I recommend you play with one. Or look at the share price of MSFT and AAPL at the peak of 08, then the bottom of the recession, compared to now. Every month you set aside as much money as you possible can for investing, no matter what.
11. Only date people who have both a 401k and a roth IRA. Employers often pay for one account so someone might sound financially responsible because ""they have a retirement account"", but they are actually fuck-wits and posers who will expect fancy diners and ruin you financially. If they ever order avocado toast, exit immediately. This goes for friends and family as well as dates. Live frugally.
12. Money does not give you purpose. Money will not help you ""find purpose"". Purpose is something you create through hard work and dedication to something greater than yourself, and when the time comes having money will be really nice. If someone tells you ""what is the point of having money if you don't spend it?"", like the avocado toast scenario, ghost them and run away. These people will suck your account dry ""getting drinks"", or ""going out for coffee"", or ""why not get a nicer apartment, you deserve it""... blah blah blah - POISON! Live frugally. 
13. Start with a ROTH IRA. You can withdraw from this for home purchases, so it doubles as a tax advantaged investment account as well as a way to save for a home. Being a home owner will improve the quality of your mating options too. Once you clear 6k a year in contributions (max out the IRA), open a 401k next and dump everything extra you have into that. Once you max out your roth and the 401k, then get a brokerage account and keep going.
14. Use a real broker like Schwab, TD Ameritrade, or Fidelity. Stay away from the millennial and gen Z crap apps like Robinhood.

Get as much money into the market as you can on dips when you are young. Full-on 100% everything in. The proof is in a compounding interest calculator, I recommend you play with one. Or look at the share price of MSFT and AAPL at the peak of 08, then the bottom of the recession, compared to now. Every month you set aside as much money as you possible can for investing, no matter what.
11. Only date people who have both a 401k and a roth IRA. Employers often pay for one account so someone might sound financially responsible because ""they have a retirement account"", but they are actually fuck-wits and posers who will expect fancy diners and ruin you financially. If they ever order avocado toast, exit immediately. This goes for friends and family as well as dates. Live frugally.
12. Money does not give you purpose. Money will not help you ""find purpose"". Purpose is something you create through hard work and dedication to something greater than yourself, and when the time comes having money will be really nice. If someone tells you ""what is the point of having money if you don't spend it?"", like the avocado toast scenario, ghost them and run away. These people will suck your account dry ""getting drinks"", or ""going out for coffee"", or ""why not get a nicer apartment, you deserve it""... blah blah blah - POISON! Live frugally. 
13. Start with a ROTH IRA. You can withdraw from this for home purchases, so it doubles as a tax advantaged investment account as well as a way to save for a home. Being a home owner will improve the quality of your mating options too. Once you clear 6k a year in contributions (max out the IRA), open a 401k next and dump everything extra you have into that. Once you max out your roth and the 401k, then get a brokerage account and keep going.
14. Use a real broker like Schwab, TD Ameritrade, or Fidelity. Stay away from the millennial and gen Z crap apps like Robinhood.

306,USA," When do you get hit? In the year that you sell.

Does it matter if you take cash out? No.

If you held for over 1 year then you incur LONG TERM capital gains, and the tax rate is capped in the USA. If you sold within one year then you incur SHORT TERM capital gains and are taxed at your prevailing tax rate, which could be higher if you have a high income or lots of other gains.

Any losses you take that same year, whether short or long term, will offset your gains 1:1, so it may help to take losses in December if you have a lot of gains.",Mister_Titty,1,/r/stocks/comments/ndu9g3/capital_gains_question_when_do_i_get_hit_does_it/gyd2xwp/,0.062,0.805,0.134,0.7798
