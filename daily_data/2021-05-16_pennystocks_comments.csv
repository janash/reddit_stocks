32,LOVE," I love moody plays because while they take some time, they are done extremely smart because by doing 2 ticker changes they are handing the new company a fully cleaned shell with no debt or problems to carry over. So they tend to get higher quality companies moving in even if the process requires quite a bit of patience.

 I'm in 3 of the 4 listed here including CPSL and looking forward to seeing who moves into the shells although I would argue that both FTRK and BSPI have potentially higher price ceilings since they have better share structures. CHSO is almost too small and it's early still for it. This isn't to say I don't LOVE CPSL, cause I do.

Nothing wrong with Atossa as a SPECULATIVE investment.  It is nothing more then that.  They have no drugs on market thus no revenue.  They are banking on At-301 which JUST finished phase 1.  They haven't even started phase 2 (haven't even submitted anything to clinicaltrials.gov.  Then you have Phase 3.  Then EUA (unlikely by then since COVID vaccinations will be fully implemented thus no emergency need).  So that means NDA which is another 6m-1.5 years.  So that means this play is not going to do much of anything for 1+ year AT LEAST.  Even with great results of the different phases they will get a pump and then just drop back down again until the next phase.  If they get a negative result well that is a quick 80% loss since they don't have any other drugs on market.  People underestimate the imbalance in risk/ return when it comes to biotech plays ESPECIALLY in companies that does not have drugs already in market (consistent revenue).  

The siren song of 10x possibilities are in reality littered by THOUSANDS of biotech companies that come and go promising the same riches to the next set of hopeful investors.  Startup biotech is the ultimate penthouse/ outhouse sector.  The problem is there are MANY more outhouses then penthouses.",10xwannabe,3,/r/pennystocks/comments/ndx31x/quant_fund_renaissance_increases_atos_holdings_by/gyd9tu5/,0.104,0.801,0.095,-0.1212

60,AGTC," AGTC. Just pay closer attention around clinical results release time. Solid company with a strong, promising pipeline. Hovering around 52 week low now. Was was pumped and dumped like so many other pennies in Feb, but it's stabilized and found support (from what I can tell). I sold when it spiked in the Feb pump and bought back after/during dump. Holding 2k shares and happy to let it sit for a year and sell CC until big news. Clinical results released last week were positive and I'm bullish for the next 12-24 months. If you're looking for a long term hold, this is worth looking into. Analyst price predictions were reaffirmed, despite the beating pennies have taken over the past few months. Do note that biotech plays are inherently risky (what penny isn't honestly), if it succeeds it'll jump anywhere from 3x to 9x it's current price. I can see a steady rise in price over the next 6-12 months.
