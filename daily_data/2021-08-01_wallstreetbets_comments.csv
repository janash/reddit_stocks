59,TD," The thing you're forgetting is TD Ameritrade has $1.6 trillion in mostly boomer assets.

65,UI," Robinhood's advantage in scaling is that they get to the users first, and people tend to not want to switch financial institutions because it's inconvenient. Effectively the average user that started out with $100 will keep investing with them regardless of how big their account gets. I work in banking and I see people leave hundreds of thousands of dollars in accounts paying next to no interest, just because that's who they bank with and they can't be assed to move their money to get a better rate, I think Robinhood is relying on that same concept of ""sticky"" users (the best customers for a company btw, because you don't have to work as hard to keep them).  Selling their users shares of the company at IPO is also a very sly move as some media commentators have noted, because now they're even less likely to want to move their money somewhere else. 

I think as their customers age the ""quality"" will improve. The average user is going to start out with $5k or less in their portfolio, but their portfolio will grow over time along with their investment knowledge, and most people don't want to switch brokers because it's just enough of a pain to sort out transferring your shares and learning a new UI that people aren't going to want to bother, especially when the actual cost of not switching is hidden (execution quality/payment for order flow).

Anecdotally, I started out with an account size of a few hundred bucks not having a clue what I was doing, and now I've gotten up to $65k, with another $10k in margin. I imagine that is the kind of individual account growth Robinhood is hoping/planning for.",Affectionate_Law3788,6,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ovqjyz/people_who_shorted_hood_honey_you_got_a_big_storm/h7c0xaj/,0.063,0.869,0.068,0.5061

71,GDP," China will surpass us, it’s only a matter of time. The US gov is simply too focused on democratic political positions, ensuring the 1% stays the same, and ensuring no-ones feeling get hurt. The US has not been focused on building long term infrastructure, expanding GDP, or advancing the educational system so we can create a future of bright minded individuals to ensure that America stays #1. It’s just an ‘expectation’ that we will always be #1.

What’s becoming certain is the US is #1 as a laughing stock for every other country on the issues that currently become main-stream media everyday. While these topics may be somewhat of importance, China sure in the hell doesn’t make that the #1 focus, they are doing what is necessary to ensure it happens.


The key to democracy isn’t by fear, it’s by distraction. Doesn’t matter which side of the politic fence you stand on, you just have to step back and look at the bigger picture. 

Is America truly focused on long term growth and building? Capital hill’s primary objective is focuses on prior elections, culture issues, and social media. Mercia is too caught up on entertainment news! Keep kicking the can, it’s only a matter of time.

74,BABA," Looking at charts, the way i see it. Is this is only noise. Yes there is risk in China, this is exactly what been playing out for these past 10 or so months (longer but i am talking about BABA specifically). The trend was always down, it eventually broke out only to get back to a downward trend, because of noise. However it looks like it wants to break out again. Now i am not saying it will 100% go to the moon etc etc.

But if you just look at technicals you cant be bearish on BABA specifically at least not on say a 6-12 month horizon. Meaning that this looks like a good trade opportunity. Again there is risk, there is always risk. But if you follow the trend, going long on BABA in the 180-210 range is a good trade, which is exactly what i did and if you just stick to your method and don't let emotions control your strategy, there is nothing that tells you to sell yet (except emotion). We will see how this play out. But if you just follow the trend and never let emotions get the better of you, you should buy BABA and hold it until this whole thing plays out or it breaks below 160 or so.

The one thing I truly trust is that China will act in its own self interest, and it is not in their self interest to let American regulators access audit working papers from large Chinese companies.

There were literally publicly traded “dot.com” companies that had little more than a domain name and no successful business model ongoing. I know this because I was just beginning to invest and was watching it play out in real time. There were hundreds of companies being talked about and hyped up daily, and it was just too much to take it all in. So I stayed out. All of the technology companies, along with internet commerce, were in their infancy. The companies with an actual business model or products got dragged down with the garbage. The real legitimate companies eventually emerged as the winners they are today. As the dust began to settle I started slowly buying companies I believed in. I lost on some and won hugely on some. It is irrational to compare AMZN, APPL, and the rest of today’s “big tech” to the companies that collapsed in the dot.com bubble.",489yearoldman,9,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ovhjy7/delta_variant_isnt_the_event_that_will_crash_the/h7b20di/,0.057,0.871,0.072,0.7003

What you're saying doesn't make a lot of sense, it's all over the place. I'll stand by what i said. Everytime the SPY has hit an ATH, you wouldn't have been wrong with buying ATH -$1-2 puts and you'd be making bank every week.

Everytime we have red days, like May 11, June 18th, July 8th?, where it dips by 1% or more, that's sale. It's pretty safe to buy calls again.

However all of the other govt spending isn't going to be changing so said expansion should renew pretty quickly.

That's my thesis at least. True valuation is definitely overvalued right now, but the whole market looking forward concept is very real and 4.5 Trillion dollars goes a loooong fucking way.

153,TA," One of the biggest mistakes I see in these ""black swan"" posts is that people are generally making predictions on one or two indicators without considering any competing information. Market crashes require major systemic weaknesses to emerge and even then, you can't necessarily tell when or how the crash will occur because it's not the trend that causes the crash, it's the breaker failing to catch the systemic accumulating event. Most of the time, if they catch it in time they can push the monetary and credit levers to adjust for it (see: 2020).

If you and I can see the crash trend in a 5-minute TA or a general sentiment about something like inflation, then they can see it, too.

In hindsight, 2008 was visible about 3 years earlier.  I called that it was going to come but not when. I lost a relationship because I refused to buy a house then because I knew the market was going to crash because the fundamentals were continuously stacking prices relative to income and knew that the political economy to reverse the situation didn't exist. But on top of that, the Bush administration was a deregulatory regime engaged in a war and embroiled, at that time, in a scandal regarding slashing social security... the administration had repeatedly proven it wouldn't step in prior to foreseeable disaster, and it didn't... What you have there is a multivariate factor set, which I predicted would happen in 2007. Considering that's when the ARM mortgages began to default, I didn't do poorly, but I was still nearly a year and a half off as far as the crash is concerned.

In the end, for the crash to finally materialize you needed the mortgage securities crisis to create a systemic risk condition... it could have been picked up early, but deregulatory regimes don't usually intercede until after there's a crisis.",Moist_Lunch_5075,8,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ovitlk/stop_trying_to_predict_the_next_market_crash/h79ocjr/,0.164,0.785,0.05,-0.9911

Police have zero interest in enforcing COVID rules as well. Fact is, COVID is over unless a variant that seriously poses a risk to vaccinated people arises. Even China is not going to do any major shut-downs as they will destroy their economy if they do so. Last time, they understood everyone else in the world would have to shut-down after them, so their draconian shut-down enabled them to start-up industries while everyone was sitting on their hands. This time, if China shuts down, it will boost manufacturing around the world and hurt them for a long time.

186,UK," I'm not getting the panic stateside about Delta (and sure as heck wouldn't place puts on the basis of it) 

Take a look at our past few months in the UK - 

The percentage of hospitalisation /deaths in those that have been vaccinated is pretty low, and Delta is rife here (it has made up the vast percentage of infections for months, thanks to some seriously shit border decisions). 

We have seen huge peaks over the past few months, (possibly due to the increased transmission capability of Delta) , yet hospitalisation and death rates remained stubbornly low, and over the past week or so, infection numbers in general have dropped like a stone. 

Delta is not the black death being claimed (assuming of course your vaccination program is good?) by media/the Web. 

And yes I am aware that vaccinated people are still being hospitalised /dying, the general comment about low percentages still stands, despite these (certainly in the UK, at least) rare exceptions.",AngryApplesPH,19,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ovfnjc/will_the_delta_variant_cause_travel_restrictions/h7a4vod/,0.118,0.77,0.112,-0.2728

217,UK," WRT general inflation my monthly costs have not increased over the last year at all, but I'm in the UK so this might just be a US thing (second hand cars is definitely happening in the UK though).


I think used cars had been really depressed in price for a long time when they're actually quite valuable.

We've been used to cars deprecating 50% within a couple of years which is probably unjustified but cheap credit from manufacturers sustained it because people without much money can just hire something nice for a few years instead (completely retarded financial decision but this is not surprising people are financially illiterate).

Covid comes, noone wants new cars for a few months, manufacturers cancel all their supply orders and get put to the back of the queue for chips which limits supply but doesn't increase costs to build.

Manufacturers can't really increase their prices by 50% because of demand because they have a business and brand to think of for the next 50 yrs not to throw away for a year or so of price gouging.

So reduced supply of new cars with limited increase in price of them just made people realise actually there isn't much wrong with a 4yr old car that has done 40k miles, certainly not to only be worth 1/4 what it was, there's definitely room for that to surge up to 1/2 what it was because of demand.",avl0,7,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ovruu7/whats_really_going_on_with_inflation/h7bdfvb/,0.107,0.775,0.117,0.7666

447,TA," No, it’s 2 different things. 

It could be a good play but it’s not because “support” or “resistance” held. 

Support resistance happens where there is strong demand/supply areas and traders literally look at price level and determine that to be a good price to buy or sell. 

If you can understand why option pricing has no support or resistance you’ll understand why TA on GUSH is pure nonsense. 

The price on GUSH has nothing to do with demand and supply and everything to do with the underlying shares. 

TA is basically trying to decipher what’s the supply/demand relationship.",thisis4investing,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ovltja/gush_ta_where_we_go_from_here/h7bozmu/,0.084,0.727,0.189,0.9209
448,TA," Exactly. 

I.e price level of GUSH is based on whatever you’ve copied and paste here and has nothing to do with demand and supply. 

TA is a technique that helps to determine supply and demand. Hence “overbought” vs “oversold” levels, support is where many buyers previously bought and may be interested to buy again. Resistance is where sellers sold and may be interested to sell again.

GUSH price is not a result of demand supply relationship.",thisis4investing,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ovltja/gush_ta_where_we_go_from_here/h7bplff/,0.055,0.815,0.13,0.802

The only reason TLRY is even above $10 is that so many potheads are EMOTIONALLY invested in it. The reality is that unless you separate your emotions from your investing, you're gonna lose money.

Legalization is still a long way off, regardless of your optimism. Introducing legislation means nothing. Once a bill is on the President's desk and signed into law, THEN the pot stocks will explode, but that is most likely years down the road.
