0,GDP," OP, I think it could take 10 years, or more.  Use Japan as your guide.  Japan is about 10-15 years further along than the US, but we are following the Bank of Japan pathway.  

Since like 1999, the Bank of Japan has a negative interest rates, QE equal to 25% of the economy, and is now the largest holder of Japanese stocks, a top 10 shareholder of over half the large public companies, and owns 40% of the outstanding debt.  The Bank of Japan balance sheet is bigger than the Japanese GDP. That is where we are heading, and Japan has struggled to have interest rates over .5%.  

To put that into perspective, the Fed would have to own $11 trillion in US debt, print $2 trillion in new money, buy assets with that money, and eventually amass a balance sheet over $29 trillion dollars.  Those are insane numbers, but during Covid, the Fed grew its balance sheet by $3 trillion and it had minimal impact on the currency value or Treasury bond market, and the balance sheet is probably $8-9 trillion right now?

What Japan foreshadows for us is that once you go down this road of extraordinary monetary policy, it becomes too painful to (1) reduce the balance sheet and (2) meaningfully raise rates.  They might eventually get above 1%, but it will be incredibly painful to get back up to 3% or to get the balance sheet below $6 trillion.  

When Jerome Powell raised rates 4 times in 2018 and followed a path of Quantative Tightening (QT) and he nearly blew up the bond market and the stock market.  No Fed chair is going to be willing to go down that path in the next 10-20 years.  No one wants to be grilled by Senators, who have constituents (from school teachers to high end professionals) who have seen their retirement funds slaughtered.  Not when it is too easy to keep inflation rolling along with negative, zero, or near-zero interest rates. The political costs are too high.",YouOr2,65,/r/investing/comments/p3dbbw/why_did_it_take_the_fed_so_long_to_raise_rates_to/h8qij81/,0.095,0.816,0.089,-0.5267
1,UK," I find it funny. I was watching ""Queen of Versailles"" last night and at one point the guy's son says my dad would say ""they got as addicted to all this cheap money and they took it away. Now we are like addicts searching for it"" 

Fast forward to 2021. Instead of dodgy loans with low interest rates we have legit real loans with low-interest rates. Once again businesses and people are addicted to this cheap money.  Just because it's now legit doesn't make it any less troublesome than last time. Businesses are way indebted and so are individuals. 

It won't end well. As usual at these hyper bull times we hear time and time again ""it's different this time"" it's just never true. Somebody eventually has to pay these loans back. The fact is nobody has the money.

This end of cycle will be more global than before. Canada and Australia and New Zealand will be the worst hit. The US and UK will take a beating but not as bad as those countries. The EU is also in a weak place with countries like Spain, Greece, and Portugal all on the verge of bankruptcy if rates rise.",athetopofahill,2,/r/investing/comments/p3dbbw/why_did_it_take_the_fed_so_long_to_raise_rates_to/h8ss4df/,0.084,0.856,0.06,-0.2386
2,USA," >assuming they sneak in a rate increase at the end of the year and we do not experience another major COVID wave?

Americans really don't seem to clue into the fact that they and the globe are back into a major COVID wave. The USA is back to a 7 day rolling average of new 125,000 cases daily and deaths, which always lag behind the case spike, is back to a 7 day rolling average of 550 deaths per day. That's pretty comparable to when the world was in full panic mode but it seems like a lot of America has just decided that the pandemic is over

You're not on your way to full recovery until you convince the 45% of your population that is hesitant to get vaccinated, and global recovery won't be assured until vaccine distribution actually reaches beyond the G20. We will keep having covid aftershocks for a while, the market is just forward looking to beyond that",CaptainCanuck93,1,/r/investing/comments/p3dbbw/why_did_it_take_the_fed_so_long_to_raise_rates_to/h8ssry2/,0.055,0.88,0.066,0.1986
3,GDP," I'm removing this entire comment thread.  I am genuinely disappointed in the absolute garbage that gets voted to the top of this sub nowadays.  The Fed does not *need* inflation to gap up, they are not concerned with sovereign debt loads - the cost to service debt has literally never been lower as a percentage of GDP.

I've said this a number of times, but it's astonishing how even a simple googling will expose just how completely ignorant most people who make posts like yours are.

4,GDP, Isn't the big issue in Japan lack of population growth?    In the long run population growth is a key factor in GDP growth as well.   You can only squeeze so much more gains out of your labor force.,rainman_104,2,/r/investing/comments/p3dbbw/why_did_it_take_the_fed_so_long_to_raise_rates_to/h8segf6/,0.05,0.672,0.279,0.861
5,NOW," Woah there, is Japan the reserve currency? When you make the rules, you can do things that others can't. The entire country, or currency of Japan could default, and the world would go on, at a price. If the US economy, or currency/treasuries, defaulted and crashed there would be different consequences. So you can't say Japan went down this path and the US will experience the exact same effects. 

Also, in the US model (newbie here), it seems like all this debt and speculation (example fractional banking) actually creates a lot of wealth- borrowing from the next generations wealth to speculate NOW i creates a lot more returns, since today's dollar will be worth 30-50% more than a dollar 10 years from now. The sooner you can borrow and spend, the sooner you can gain more money that if you were responsible (the US ""can't"" loose money since they can always print more, or borrow from itself). 

**Think of it this way:** for every dollar in deficit that is spent now the US might gain back 2-3 dollars immediately (the dollar goes to a business who pays it as wages, where it is used to buy food, which pays the farmer, etc.), but they will owe 4 dollars, 20 years from now. Immediately that 2-3 dollars can be re-invested for growth, AND at the same time, the entire market/currency is being devalued by multiple mechanisms (like quantitative easing), which means that 2-3 dollars you borrowed is only worth 20 cents in yesterday's dollars, but 2-3 dollars in future devalued dollar. So the sooner you exchange your ""credit"" for cash today, the better value you get for that credit! SPEND SPEND SPEND! Which explains why this whole argument about debt, and trillions, is pointless (for now). 

IF there is a deleveraging, and IF there is some kind of crash, yes the game is up. But the game is then up for everyone, just like how the rest of the world paid a large portion of the lost value during the 2009 mortgage/loans bubble. Most of the loans and property were created/represented in north America, but a lot of the losses were spread around the the world, so the sooner you make some fake/risky loans and collect dollars today, the more you will come out ahead 10 years from now when the bubble crashes and everyone else has to pay for it. Even if you had to give back all the money spent on bad loans, since you took the cash and invested it, AND the future dollars are worth less, you come out ahead!",1011010110001010,8,/r/investing/comments/p3dbbw/why_did_it_take_the_fed_so_long_to_raise_rates_to/h8ru24g/,0.057,0.842,0.101,0.9362

12,DCF," While coming into a lot of cash on RSUs is a nice problem to have, figuring out how to deploy a pile of cash is always a challenge.  A lot of posts here say ""statistically, it's best to lump sum"" rather than DCAing, and they are right -- if you group together all of the outcomes ever, most of them would have turned out best if you just put your money in all at once.  My objection is that it's like saying, ""statistically, you're not going to get hit by lightning playing golf "" but not considering the fact that you might be at the top of a mountain in a thunderstorm this specific time.  

The issue right now is that the CAPE on the market is very, very high -- almost as high as it's ever been.  Yes, PE is not a perfect measure of value, and yes, interest rates are super low, reducing the discount rate people are using to value stocks.  But if you look at a plot of 10 year and 15 year forward returns vs CAPE (it's in the JPM quarterly investor reports), when we are in this territory it's like -10% to 2%.  It's not hard to imagine why; current prices are factoring in *every* good thing that could possibly happen: interest rates stay low, earnings continue to grow at a very fast clip, etc.  If any of these are wrong, prices will fall.  And if prices continue to rise quickly -- it just makes this situation worse.  If all the assumptions are right driving price, the discount rate suggests 4-5% or so is what's expected -- what an anemic return for such a risky investment.

This isn't advice, and I can't tell you what's going to happen in the next year.  Nobody can.  The DOW could go to 50k.  It could drop to 15k.

The fact you're asking reddit tells me, you're not 100% behind the lump sum method.

I was in your shoes 2.5 years ago, RSUs vested & sold, lots of cash to invest. And I knew that lump sum is superior to DCAing but I also hesitated. What I did was coming up with a plan that would remove most of the decisions for me:

DCA the sum over two years, invest 1/24 each month. Double the monthly investment for each 5% down from market ATH. I made a spreadsheet that would calculate this for me so each month it would tell me exactly how much I should be putting into the market.

I failed to follow the plan still, as I didn't increase my investments during the covid correction last year. But at least I did invest the regular monthly sum.

I'm done DCAing now and let me tell you, I'm glad I did what I did. I'd have much more money were I lump-sum it, but chances are I'd be much more anxious during those years and maybe pull out (partially) and regret it now.",OneOfDozDeservesGold,1,/r/investing/comments/p3glky/if_youre_60_cash_right_now_will_you_allocate_all/h8rm86b/,0.069,0.844,0.087,0.6627

22,AMC," Top Tickers - August 2021 (for people tired of AMC and GME and all that other stuff)

AZUL - Azul Airlines Brazil. Top ranked airline in the world by TripAdvisor. Balance sheet was so strong that they refused government aid during pandemic. Favorite to acquire LATAM airlines and become top South American carrier in near future.

BP - British Petroleum. Technical play with solid setup and 90% near term upside. Thank me in 5 weeks.

SIX - Six Flags. Attendance set summer records with ticket sales for 2021 summer exceeding 2019 numbers substantially. This will show up in Q3 and Q4 numbers in a big way. Domestic travel has been strong and six flags has been tearing it up from an attendance standpoint.

UGI - UGI Corporation is a large integrated natural gas supplier that most of you will know from the Amerigas brand. You know those bbqs that were firing up all summer now that we can see each other, yeah powered by UGI Corp. strong numbers coming in.

VVI - Viad Corporation is the largest convention company in the country. Any large convention from video game conventions to medical conventions to Vegas anything, chances are it was put on by Viad. They own great tourist properties in Banff Canada as well which were very popular pre covid and stand to benefit strongly from an bilateral open border coming very soon. As conventions continue to open back up this stock will boom.

GPMT - Granite Point Mortgage Trust is a wonderful technical play. It’s the gift that just keeps on giving. Real under the radar type stock that’s been steadily streaking higher day after day after day. They trade mortgages etc..

SPR - Spirit Aerosystems, not spirit airlines, produces all of the composite wing tips and bodies for Boeing airplanes. They have government contracts as well locked in through 2035. Terrific company with extremely high barriers to entry. Do plenty of airline repairs as well.

MCS - Marcus Corporation is the third largest cinema owner in the United States with a stellar presence in the Midwest. They own a series of high performing hotel properties as well and have a substantial fall coming up. Bond, Batman, Top Gun, Mission Impossible, Marvel etc… It’s the healthiest box office play by far. If you’re buying a theatre company for the business instead of the short squeeze, MCS is far and away the top choice over AMC and Edwards etc.

JWN - Nordstrom’s has actually transitioned beautifully from just a big box retailer to an incredibly strong online fulfillment company. They blew people away by posting a profit in the depths of the quarantine and have started seeing numbers as high as 65% of all business being sold online and on mobile. Back to school shopping is already off to a record breaking start per CEO comments and JWN stands to profit further from a return to work shopping spree with many people having slightly different bodies than pre covid. Nordstrom’s also attracts substantial clientele from overseas travelers once borders fully open back up. Numbers also crushed Macy’s. Wasn’t close in mid summer reporting.

NCLH - Norwegian Cruise Lines is the top cruise ship play with the strongest balance sheet as well as the most modern fleet of ships that require the least amount of updating for cruising in 2021. 2021 cruises have already sold out at higher prices than 2019. A lot of boomers are dying to get out there and travel and gamble their saving away on the open seas. Excited as recent bookings numbers that came in stronger than anticipated per CEO commentary.

UAL - United Airlines is expected to see a boost from back to school travel and from reopened international travel. UAL was able to restructure advantageous fuel futures contracts during 2020 and stand to benefit from fuel synergies going forward. Pent up demand will take this sweet technical base higher in the short term.

Back to school shopping is already off to a record breaking start per CEO comments and JWN stands to profit further from a return to work shopping spree with many people having slightly different bodies than pre covid. Nordstrom’s also attracts substantial clientele from overseas travelers once borders fully open back up. Numbers also crushed Macy’s. Wasn’t close in mid summer reporting.

NCLH - Norwegian Cruise Lines is the top cruise ship play with the strongest balance sheet as well as the most modern fleet of ships that require the least amount of updating for cruising in 2021. 2021 cruises have already sold out at higher prices than 2019. A lot of boomers are dying to get out there and travel and gamble their saving away on the open seas. Excited as recent bookings numbers that came in stronger than anticipated per CEO commentary.

UAL - United Airlines is expected to see a boost from back to school travel and from reopened international travel. UAL was able to restructure advantageous fuel futures contracts during 2020 and stand to benefit from fuel synergies going forward. Pent up demand will take this sweet technical base higher in the short term.

As conventions continue to open back up this stock will boom.

GPMT - Granite Point Mortgage Trust is a wonderful technical play. It’s the gift that just keeps on giving. Real under the radar type stock that’s been steadily streaking higher day after day after day. They trade mortgages etc..

MCS - Marcus Corporation is the third largest cinema owner in the United States with a stellar presence in the Midwest. They own a series of high performing hotel properties as well and have a substantial fall coming up. Bond, Batman, Top Gun, Mission Impossible, Marvel etc… It’s the healthiest box office play by far. If you’re buying a theatre company for the business instead of the short squeeze, MCS is far and away the top choice over AMC and Edwards etc.

32,UAL," Top Tickers - August 2021 (for people tired of AMC and GME and all that other stuff)

AZUL - Azul Airlines Brazil. Top ranked airline in the world by TripAdvisor. Balance sheet was so strong that they refused government aid during pandemic. Favorite to acquire LATAM airlines and become top South American carrier in near future.

BP - British Petroleum. Technical play with solid setup and 90% near term upside. Thank me in 5 weeks.

SIX - Six Flags. Attendance set summer records with ticket sales for 2021 summer exceeding 2019 numbers substantially. This will show up in Q3 and Q4 numbers in a big way. Domestic travel has been strong and six flags has been tearing it up from an attendance standpoint.

UGI - UGI Corporation is a large integrated natural gas supplier that most of you will know from the Amerigas brand. You know those bbqs that were firing up all summer now that we can see each other, yeah powered by UGI Corp. strong numbers coming in.

VVI - Viad Corporation is the largest convention company in the country. Any large convention from video game conventions to medical conventions to Vegas anything, chances are it was put on by Viad. They own great tourist properties in Banff Canada as well which were very popular pre covid and stand to benefit strongly from an bilateral open border coming very soon. As conventions continue to open back up this stock will boom.

GPMT - Granite Point Mortgage Trust is a wonderful technical play. It’s the gift that just keeps on giving. Real under the radar type stock that’s been steadily streaking higher day after day after day. They trade mortgages etc..

SPR - Spirit Aerosystems, not spirit airlines, produces all of the composite wing tips and bodies for Boeing airplanes. They have government contracts as well locked in through 2035. Terrific company with extremely high barriers to entry. Do plenty of airline repairs as well.

MCS - Marcus Corporation is the third largest cinema owner in the United States with a stellar presence in the Midwest. They own a series of high performing hotel properties as well and have a substantial fall coming up. Bond, Batman, Top Gun, Mission Impossible, Marvel etc… It’s the healthiest box office play by far. If you’re buying a theatre company for the business instead of the short squeeze, MCS is far and away the top choice over AMC and Edwards etc.

JWN - Nordstrom’s has actually transitioned beautifully from just a big box retailer to an incredibly strong online fulfillment company. They blew people away by posting a profit in the depths of the quarantine and have started seeing numbers as high as 65% of all business being sold online and on mobile. Back to school shopping is already off to a record breaking start per CEO comments and JWN stands to profit further from a return to work shopping spree with many people having slightly different bodies than pre covid. Nordstrom’s also attracts substantial clientele from overseas travelers once borders fully open back up. Numbers also crushed Macy’s. Wasn’t close in mid summer reporting.

NCLH - Norwegian Cruise Lines is the top cruise ship play with the strongest balance sheet as well as the most modern fleet of ships that require the least amount of updating for cruising in 2021. 2021 cruises have already sold out at higher prices than 2019. A lot of boomers are dying to get out there and travel and gamble their saving away on the open seas. Excited as recent bookings numbers that came in stronger than anticipated per CEO commentary.

UAL - United Airlines is expected to see a boost from back to school travel and from reopened international travel. UAL was able to restructure advantageous fuel futures contracts during 2020 and stand to benefit from fuel synergies going forward. Pent up demand will take this sweet technical base higher in the short term.

43,SBUX," Anyone who invests in a lucky company at the right time will beat the market over the course of their life span. Now, you would probably call that luck. You would say I just ""got lucky"". But I've done it more than once. Okay, I admit Starbucks was pure luck, I worked there and decided to dump all my savings into it even though I knew nothing about investing.

But I got into Alphabet back in 2007 because I was very interested in what they were doing and saw a lot of potential. I got into Apple after the huge ipod peak and soon after they released the iphone, so it looked like I was jumping in on a peak, but of course I made a killing there. Why did I invest so heavily? Because I saw the smart phone knew it would revolutionize the world.

So that's 3 times. Fine, SBUX was dumb luck, but the other two were not. You can claim it was luck all you want.

So yes, I have absolutely beat the market.  You would have too if you had gotten into one of these companies at the right time. Everyone will tell you this can't reliably be done, that no one can predict which companies will succeed wildly. I disagree. I think it can be done.

47,YOU," We have all done that at some point.  It’s a lesson in humility that every good investor takes to heart.  One of the most important things to learn early on in the investing journey is who YOU are; the degree of risk you’re truly willing to take and your life and money goals.  Using that knowledge as the basis of how you evaluate investment opportunities and make decisions is fundamental to success.  

For example, my spouse bemoaned the fact that we didn’t invest in cannabis and buy Bitcoin years ago.  The reality is, our risk tolerance is relatively low, always has been always will be in about every area of our lives.  I don’t look back at things like Bitcoin and kick myself, because I know the risk profile is beyond my acceptable parameters.  I’m a buy and hold, ETF, blue chip, sector investor through and through, so I stick to my strategy and don’t get distracted by the pointless what-ifs.

48,GDP," I expect a 5-10% correction once a year or so, but I doubt we see a 20%+ decline bear market so soon after the last one unless we have a significant slowdown in the real economy. 

Currently Real GDP growth is much higher than normal (over 6% in H1 2021, Fed projecting 6% for Q3 as well), earnings are stellar, and job growth is 600k+ per month (average so far this year). These are sufficient reasons for people to continue to be optimistic, even crazily optimistic, for a while.

Additionally, people talk about space mining - *mining on Earth isn't a great business.* Nothing against it, and I'm in the minority with this opinion clearly - but space travel is really one future theme that I am really not interested in at all.

**""Cannabis""** - Once the US makes it legal on federal level the market will explode""

Canadian cannabis companies still not profitable almost three years into legalization: https://www.marketwatch.com/story/canadian-cannabis-companies-are-still-not-profitable-almost-three-years-into-full-legalization-earnings-show-11628270640

The pure play growers are still not of interest to me. I have been gradually increasing allocation to MSOs but its gone from a very very small (smol) allocation to a very small allocation and I don't really see it getting past a small allocation at this point. That may change, but I still don't see ever having a huge position in weed stocks. I don't probably ever see having a position in the pure play growers.  Very (very) pro pot, but people just really are so of the belief that this is going to be the biggest thing ever that they're not looking at obstacles/issues.

I mean, look at CRON, TLRY, CGC, HEXO and other plays that still remain under or way under where they were 2-3 years ago. I guess the other issue I have is the MSOs and their ""house brands"" - I mean look at Cresco, GTI and others that have their dispensaries and they have their own assortment of brands. The pure play growers feel a little like Kraft or General Mills trying to get onto the shelves at Target and trying to fight for space for Target's increasing # of store brands. There's X amount of shelf space, limitations on # of licenses in most states. 

**""Lab Meat""** - I am long SRNG.

**""Psychedelics""** - I think the potential benefits of psychedelics are compelling, but I'm a little more skeptical on legalization beyond a therapeutic sense. I don't see it becoming legal recreationally across the country (although if it is perhaps MSOs get in on that business?) I owned CMPS when it IPO'd last year and sold it near the end of last year.

67,TER," I personally bet on nickel, as one of the biggest surge potential. Nickel is going to play the vital rolne in lithium-ion batteries, as it's one of the best ingredients for [cathode.It](https://cathode.It) is one of the biggest concerns of Elon Musk on his mission to have 1TWH battery production.[https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/09/heres-what-tesla-will-put-in-its-new-batteries/](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/09/heres-what-tesla-will-put-in-its-new-batteries/)

Another metal is cobalt, though there's only a few stocks mining it and it's quite volatile market. Most of the cobalt is mined in Congo. The mining situation is unstable, and there are some conflicts around it. That's why there's no good ETF for cobalt miners so far.

Copper had a surge recently and it's difficult for me to predict it. I think, I've missed this train.

About energy production: Developed countries declare to 0 CO2 emission within few decades. That means switching to renewable energy sources. I don't see wind and solar playing big role in it, unlkie atomic energy. Some experts say there's going to be another uranium boom in the market. The facts are encouraging:  
current uranium price: 31,70 USD/lb  
total uranium mining cost is around 60 USD/lb  
ammount of uranium to be used by utilities in 2021: 200 mln lbs  
ammount of uranium to be mined in 2021: 150 mln lbs  
Current gap is covered by stock and disarming nuclear weapons. It is estimated, that these stock will go down by 50% over next 10 years.

68,NE," Grids with even a large minority portion from green/renewables are inherently unreliable. If you add on EVs to that sub-grid, it would amplify that problem. The economics aren't there to support a fallback option in most cases. Nuclear facilities have a tough time as it is keeping their economics viable, at least in the NE, so if you pull from them the demand that would go to green/renewables, they cease to exist without heavy government subsidy. At that point, the tax base would be paying an insane amount for a marginal benefit to the environment.

Bingo. With how crazy the MSAs are that they are dealing in as their primary markets, clearly the demand won't be letting up anytime soon and they could very well become the big regional player.

I knew that the shares would crash, so I tried to capitalize on this by putting in an order to short-sell 1,500 shares for $5.89, which is one penny better than its last trade price. 

However, at 3:20 PM ET, the shares resumed trading again, and it quickly went all the way down to $0.86/share, and my order never executed. 

I knew that $0.86/share was an over-reaction, so I wanted to buy about 1,000 shares, but once again, the stock halted trading on the stock markets.  So I put in a Limit Order for $0.90/share to buy. 

When the markets resumed trading for $SESN, my order never filled. The share price bounced back up to at least $1.55/share.

Edit: https://www.forbes.com/sites/denizcam/2021/05/04/inside-jessica-albas-long-and-turbulent-road-to-taking-the-honest-company-public/

""At Honest, we prioritize transparency, trust and sustainability in all that we do,” declares the company’s IPO prospectus, which was filed in April with the Securities and Exchange Commission. What’s little mentioned: Honest’s road to public markets has been rocky—with class action lawsuits over false advertising and allegedly harmful products, executive turnover and a down funding round. The company’s filings point out that sales grew 28% last year, from $236 million to $300 million, but that’s about even with what they were five years ago. 

And while Honest’s potential valuation is sure to grab headlines, that predicted value is—at best—flat from 2015, when the company raised $100 million at a $1.7 billion valuation. Meanwhile the S&P 500 has doubled in that time and the stock prices of competitors such as Unilever and Estée Lauder have risen by 30% and 246%, respectively. What was once a high-growth unicorn—landing Alba a spot on Forbes’ list of America’s wealthiest self-made women in 2016—has essentially flatlined while its competitors are thriving.""

This dude did well if he acted on his opinion:

""“[Working there] was a really good lesson, kind of riding the rocket ship up,” says a former director at Honest who was at the company at its height. “Then, at some point, you run out of fuel. You're either in outer space, or you're coming back down. I would short the stock.”

There was going to be an IPO a while ago but it was delayed and Unilever bought someone else instead:

""Any plans the company had for an IPO were apparently tabled, and Unilever—which, like many major firms at the time, sought to move more into natural products—reportedly made a bid to acquire Honest in 2016. The bid valued the business at a more modest $1 billion, according to Pitchbook, down from the $1.7 billion valuation in 2015. The deal never materialized, and Unilever instead acquired Seventh Generation, a competing eco-friendly household products company. ""

Lastly:

“It sounds like they weren't able to get a buyer, because that would have been the natural exit for a company like this one,” Kodali says. “I guess the thinking is ‘Alright, well, let's go to the public markets and see if there's any traction there.’—**but it could be disastrous**.” (-55% since IPOing like, 3 months ago I think qualifies as ""disastrous"")

Could it bounce? Could Jessica Alba somehow give some meme power to this? Certainly oversold at this point so it could bounce, but the business itself just I don't think is interesting and I don't know what the thesis beyond ""maybe it could bounce short term"" would be.

CLOV was a meme stock, I have yet to see someone make a convincing case for it beyond ""muh meme stock."" Stuff like this and WISH (-20% today, -75% since the meme peak earlier this year) works as a meme until it doesn't and when it doesn't, rather than moving on people confuse it for something beyond what it is because it worked previously.  Maybe it becomes a meme again, but aside from that, what about this is compelling?

Additionally, all the conspiracy theory ""someone is artificially keeping the price down"" stuff is a great way for people to never admit that maybe they were wrong about an investment - ""I couldn't be wrong, it's someone else's fault."" Stuff like this is why https://twitter.com/BagholderQuotes will have enough material to last eons. This whole thing of a younger generation having the view that some conspiracy is behind every investment that doesn't go well is dismaying because if it's always some conspiracy theory (""evil short hedge funds were keeping the price down!""), people (especially all the people new to investing) are not going to learn from their mistakes because they won't think they make any. 

""Not wrong just early"" - can never be wrong because you can keep saying ""just early."" ""The price is being artificially suppressed"" - or maybe there's actually something wrong with the company? Sears was run by one of the most well-known hedge fund managers around but the problem was he was the worst fucking retailer on the planet and his neglect of the company caused it to erode far faster than he could disassemble the company. The shorts faced short squeezes at times for years, but ultimately as the company literally fell apart, the short squeezes were shorter and shorter. People keep saying things like, ""Eddie's a billionaire, he has a plan!"" It just look one look at a store to realize he didn't and eventually it went bankrupt. Seritage, the former Sears REIT is down 60% since it went public and if Buffett still owns it in his personal account he's lost a ton. 

Sometimes shorts are going to be very, very right. Sometimes they're not but I think people should be open to the idea that maybe someone with a negative opinion might have seen something you didn't. Maybe it's something substantial that causes you to sell, maybe it's minor but makes you think differently about an aspect of the company. Maybe you just disagree and if the price is down because of someone's short thesis, that's an opportunity. All the stuff about ""shorts are evil"" - people can have differing opinions on things and I think it's not a bad idea to be open to different opinions in investing. Everyone is going to be wrong at times but it's really important to have some sort of takeaway as to what didn't work.

Stuff like these sort of conspiracy theories and stock-specific sub-reddits that are basically cults/echo chambers is dismaying. With the stock-specific subreddits you're not likely to ever have any sort of balanced discussion because it's a bunch of longs looking for confirmation bias.

I feel bad for people who didn't do well, but when did investing become sort of centered around this sort of ""tribal"" culture of people turning individual stocks into cults? I mean, Tontards? wtf?

""Adam was one of Ackman’s biggest fans, helping start on Twitter what became known as the PSTH Support Group, **which became a self-acknowledged cult idolizing Ackman**. At one point, its members numbered close to 50 people. On Reddit, a forum dedicated to PSTH has more than 16,000 members.

The PSTH Support Group members admired Ackman’s social conscience, as evidenced by his philanthropic activities, and **obsessed over his handsome looks and silver hair**, while scanning his every word or tweet for clues about the eventual SPAC target.

These young investors were aware that there is a lot of froth — even fraud — in the SPAC market, which has become a hunting ground for short sellers.

But the **Tontards, or Tontinites, as they began to call themselves**, were convinced that Ackman’s SPAC was different. And it is. Ackman got rid of some of SPACs’ most egregious features, like free shares for sponsors (like himself), that have led to bad deals. Its warrant structure is also novel, incentivizing investors to hold the stock after a deal announcement. “It was clear to me that this was a new kind of vehicle.

103,CHPT," > Like mass scale adoption everywhere.

I guess my genuine question with the EV investing obsession is that (in the US at least) many people are struggling to pay rent, facing a horrendous healthcare system whose costs are skyrocketing and other issues. If things are broadly going to improve so much with society, the economy, etc that everyone and their cousin will be able to go out and buy a new EV in 5 years, great. I'm just not seeing it. I'd be curious if they surveyed every car owner today who didn't have an EV whether they could afford to buy an EV tomorrow if they had to what % could.

Nothing wrong with EVs at all, but I think the level of excitement over this sector would suggest the Reddit utopia of an EV in every driveway, a solar panel on every roof and a plant-based burger on every plate and just feels unrealistic.

 We also have to build out more of an infrastructure. I think that's going to be easy in some regards (commercial/retail) and I do own CHPT. However, it's not going to be easy everywhere: how many HOA discussions at condos around the country are going to be had about ""why am I paying added HOA fees to install chargers when I don't have an EV?""

Not even getting into the competitive, capital-intensive nature of the auto industry (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_defunct_automobile_manufacturers_of_the_United_States)

Infrastructure interests me (CHPT and a few other things), car tech in some cases interests me (I have a small position in CRNC), some broad manufacturing plays are interesting (MGA, which I don't currently own) but trying to pick specific brands still doesn't interest me.

What felt like dozens of EV SPACs last year because everyone wanted ""The Next Tesla"" and a number of them have already been revealed to be some variety of scam (RIDE, NKLA) or just crap (GOEV presenting its business model as one thing in the SPAC presentation and then going back on that by the time the first earnings rolled around, stuff with Faraday https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22380333/faraday-future-spac-psac-ipo-public-investigation-ffie) and others. It's a tough industry (how many times has Musk said that Tesla has been on the brink of failure over the years) and I think the ""buy at any price"" EV mania of last year really was an example of excessive hype around a theme",dvdmovie1,4,/r/investing/comments/p3jpee/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/h8sp2zw/,0.061,0.843,0.096,0.9083

112,JP," It was a meme, it stopped being a meme and lost 75% and I think the whole way down people confused it for something more than a meme because it worked for a time.  After earnings, JP Morgan took price tgt from $17 to $5 (https://seekingalpha.com/news/3730195-wish-parent-gets-double-downgrade-at-jpmorgan-after-earnings-disappoint)

Could it bounce? Sure. Might it become a meme again? Possible, but ""i hope it might become a meme again"" is not a thesis. I have no idea about the company, but looking at their home page, I see what looks to be a bunch of junk/low quality product scrolling up and down and people have to sign up to see more of it I guess.
