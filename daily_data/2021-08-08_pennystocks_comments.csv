2,API," Hey guys,

It's u/nobjos back again with this week's post. I post a similar list every week.

**I have launched a site where you can track this information in real-time. Please check it out if you are interested**

Some FAQ’s:

How does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about the stock is positive or negative).

Can I use the code/is it open source: [Yes](https://github.com/marketsentiment/mslive_public).

What is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here is the average across all the comments. Please note that if the number of mentions is lesser than 30, the sentiment value shown might not have statistical significance.",nobjos,10,/r/pennystocks/comments/p0eszv/most_discussed_stocks_in_pennystocks_last_week/h862cwh/,0.052,0.805,0.143,0.9516

Nothing wrong with that, just thought you might like to know that support.com ain't got shit to do with the stock. Unless the merger doesn't happen which doesn't seem likely.

Kaixin Auto Holdings announcing that they decided to establish a new energy vehicle (EV) business unit, which will quickly build up EV R&D, production, and marketing teams. 


The corporate strategic move was made in the context of the Chinese government’s steady support for the accelerated development of EVs and the rapid growth of the EV market in China. An with Chinese consumers’ ever-increasing recognition of EVs, new energy vehicles are expected to become the mainstream consumer model in the auto industry.

Kaixin has been engaged in negotiations of mergers and acquisitions with a number of EV manufacturers. And the company will announce the progress of major business transactions (if any) in a timely manner. And as a NASDAQ-listed company, Kaixin said it is committed to becoming another player in the EV business following Li Auto, Nio, and Xpeng.",Luciusslayer,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/p079pr/the_loungedaily_plays_august_08_2021/h86ukkw/,0.0,0.883,0.117,0.9607
