13,ATOS, I have a smaller position in CTXR - about $7k current equity - up 150% at the moment. Considering putting a bit more into it but also looking for other long buys.

18,TRCH," Oh, honey. You are in for a big surprise. 

I was up late as fuck last night creating a watchlist of all the RUSSELL additions I might throw money at. Heads up; $TRCH is one of them. 

I could never find an answer about what exactly happens when a ticker is added to the Russell 2000/3000. The reply I would always get is ‚ÄúThey will have to buy a lot of shares‚Äù 

Next Friday is about to be the biggest trading day of the year. TRCH is going  to be balls deep in all of this. 

TRCH is part of an upcoming merger, they have their ‚Äòspecial dividend‚Äô, and the Russell addition.  

$TRCH isn‚Äôt done yet.",MyThrowawayThyme,8,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/o3ex9g/thanks_for_tip_on_trch/h2buqdt/,0.031,0.931,0.038,-0.0516
19,TRCH, I‚Äôve gotten in and out a few times on TRCH (basically buy every time it hits near 5 again and sell in the 6s). I don‚Äôt mind getting caught holding because I suspect this will be a fine long term hold. However I ideally don‚Äôt want as much as I‚Äôve been buying for the dividend so I am planning on trying to get down to a small holding for META.,SpeculativeFantasm,7,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/o3ex9g/thanks_for_tip_on_trch/h2by4un/,0.033,0.877,0.089,0.4019
20,ATOS," Yeah you won't like it I think:
I will sell atleast half of my position next Friday, or open on Monday.

I think it will tank during the news release even though it will be positive news becuase it's going up a lot at the moment. ATOS did a similar move.

It really depends on how next week goes, the higher it rises by Friday the more likely it will drop during the news release",Mydral,7,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/o3ex9g/thanks_for_tip_on_trch/h2cey85/,0.055,0.868,0.076,0.3798
