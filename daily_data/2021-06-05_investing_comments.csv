I found it in my eTrade app inside the SPCE/'your holdings' news.

Furthermore, he brought up how many flights by how many ships were required to launch daily/weekly at what price simply to strike even. Path to profitability is rocky.

14,VG," * Company history shows it has shit execution over the last decade+ (wikipedia lays it out)
* Current system launches 6 people at a time with at least 3 pilots needed and ground crew with a solid rocket motor. Good luck getting margins high on that.
* Current mothership-launcher system is not scalable. Difficult to go into orbit with minimal payload. They plan on pivoting to point-to-point, but they need a bigger plane which means a ginormous mothership -- almost certainly bigger than stratolaunch's which is already the largest airplane.
* We can jerk around about the actual market size for 5 minute experiences costing 6 digit amounts. Just suffice to say it is a huge risk.
* Blue origin will compete with them now so available market will be smaller and margins will be compressed, and SpaceX's starship is likely going to demolish them when it comes out (years out, but VG has zero ability to compete)

>The third flight will demonstrate the experience of a private astronaut, with founder Sir Richard Branson expected to fly to space.

23,SPCE," Dude, look at how hard you're trying to find reasons to prop up SPCE and knock down other arguments and ask yourself if you're being a neutral observer.

It's obvious to me that you're not, and no matter what the answer to your question is, it won't matter because you'll dismiss it if you don't like it.

The reality is that SPCE is positioning itself in a hyper-niche market and hoping that basically everyone who can afford it will want to do this many times. Their entire market is only ultra high net worth individuals (you basically have to be to find the cost acceptable), and there's only like 250k of them on the planet. (Reference: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra_high-net-worth_individual)

If only 10% decide this is totally awesome and they would rather do this than the other things you could do for $200k (and getting 10% of people to do any particular commercial thing recreationally is quite high - Disneyworld can probably claim that and not much else), they'll only ever make $5B in *revenue*. That's less than their current market cap. And yes, I know there's some shitty assumptions in there (some of the most retardedly rich people may go a few times or bring some friends, other people occasionally become ridiculously rich, etc) but the point remains that it's very plausible they're incredibly overvalued, so asking ""why would someone write all this?"" seems like you're discounting the very real possibility that this company is never going to be able to justify is valuation. I'm not saying it won't - I'm just trying to encourage you not to outright discount arguments that it will. It's not like you have to be crazy to think that SPCE could significantly underperform its valuation.",C4Diesel,34,/r/investing/comments/nsi8er/virgin_galactic_spce_has_successful_test_flight/h0odc3y/,0.078,0.85,0.071,-0.0531
24,IBKR," I was with Scottrade which got bought out by TDA for about 10+ years. I recently called and tried to negotiate with them on the margin rates offered because I really wanted to start using margin and leverage but TDA rates are jokes compared to IBKR pro & lite, M1 finance, and even ""kiddy tier"" Robinhood.

I wouldn't say I had a huge account, but it was well over 600k. I called noting my long customer record, account value, and specifically listed competitors and competitor rates. I clearly defined that what rate I wanted too.

So their rates are ridiculously high and only suitable for trading. I'm 98% LT investments, my buys are intended to be 1yr+, and even my shortest sales (2020 market means some things move up too quick too fast) will be months rather than days.

When you're working with long term margin rates like these won't cut it in a normal business environment. https://www.tdameritrade.com/pricing/margin-and-interest-rates.html

I asked for a reduced or flat tiered rate of 2-4%. They did comply and reduced my rates. However it was not flat, but tiered like the link I showed. Only my tiered rates were 7.1%/6.85/6.6/5.60/...../4.50%. The lowest being 4.50% if I was borrowing amounts over +$1M. IKBR lite charging 2.56% from $0. IBKR pro starts at 1.56% and drops even more if you're working big boy numbers.

It's not what I wanted so I just transferred 95% of my portfolio over to IBKR.

I still keep my TDA account open for the record of past trades with a few securities in it, but at this point I'm checked out just leaving a bridge unburnt. I wouldn't go back if they offered me the same margin rates. Craziest part in all this is TDA basically ***BOUGHT*** my account from Scottrade via acquisition.

47,GME," That's why the money was in CTF while it was in trust for you. The trustee of the trust was required by law to invest only in acceptable holdings that meet its fiduciary obligations and the objectives of the trust. In other words, because the trustee is legally bound to manage the trust in your best interests, they have to pick only acceptable investments keeping in mind trust duration, your age, trust objectives (ie, is the trust required to pay you income, do you have access to the capital, etc). They can't just dump it all in GME and hope for the best. 

CTFs are are actively managed funds, held by trust companies which are regulated entities like banks and subject to trust laws. They pool holdings from other trust companies which themselves hold in securities and funds of funds.

The CTF is the simplest way for a trustee to all but ensure the funds are invested appropriately, without the expense, time and effort of picking individual securities. 

In all likelihood the CTF holds positions in thousands of holdings. The PM is not wrong to say they can't list every single one of them. But they should be able to give you performance analysis of the CTF.

You're invested in a specific subset of the CTF (that's the name you reference in your OP), much like you would pick a ""growth"" or ""balanced"" mutual fund depending on your investment horizon, goals and risk tolerance.

Whats odd to me is that while there are overlaps in their market, LOGI demand is much more related to home offices, which are very likely going to see a demand decline, while CRSR peripheral demand is much more tied to niche gamer markets, which im not 100% convinced is as likely to implode relative to the LOGI market.

TLDR: I feel like the post pandemic demand destruction in 2021 will hit LOGI much worse than CRSR, yet the market seems to have it in the other direction.

Logi had a better YoY growth compared to CRSR, even though its a more established company. 117% compared to 71.6%. If a more established company is growing faster than what many consider to be a growth company, I can see it as a big red flag.

Logi is a Swedish company, and their corporate tax rate is 14.93%. With Biden's corporate tax proposal of 28%, I can see taxes take a bigger toll on CRSR than on LOGI.

People are scared of inflation as well. When people have less buying power, they tend to avoid spending money on premium products; which is what CRSR is known for.

CRSR's CFO exercised some options and sold half the exercised shares (around 240K$)  close of business last thursday at 35$, which tanked the stock like 6%. 

I'm long on CRSR as well, 500 shares, an August $30 Call, and a 2023 35/40 Bullish Debit Spread, I think its extremely undervalued given the circumstances you mentioned.

For Royal Bank to fail, Canada as a country would have to fail. The banks are like it’s financial backbone. Canadian banks are VERY different than US banks in terms of having regulations to ensure they remain rock solid. I am Canadian, and my basic motto is when in doubt…buy more Royal Bank.

74,CRSR," Thanks for the perspective. Makes sense.  The inflation one in particular makes sense that it would clip a younger company much harder.

The one thats interesting to me is that delta on YoY.  If the logi growth was primarily around home office builds it actually makes sense to me that it would have spiked more than CRSR as I doubt many non-gamers were buying their products for home office.  But that extra YoY pop they gained makes me think they may take a bigger nut punch in 2021.

75,EDR," Crowdstrike is primarily known for endpoint protection which are software solutions to protect computers (workstations, laptops, servers) known as NGAV (next gen antivirus) and EDR (endpoint detect and response). They also offer a type of managed service known in the industry as MDR. Their customers will range across all industries and their solutions are appropriate for small to large enterprises. It's actually a pretty crowded market imo. There aren't a lot of comparables in the public market but you may be able to check out Sentinel 1 when they IPO. There are rumors of Cybereason IPO as well. 

Fireye has an EDR solution but I imagine it's a tiny part of their business. And no one really would bring up Fireeye when talking about endpoint protection. Fireeye/Mandiant is most known for their incident response and forensic products and services. They are usually on top of most people's list to call whenever there is a security breach. 

Both Palo Alto and Fortinet started off as security networking companies competing with traditional firewall companies like Netscreen and Cisco. In fact, the founders of both companies are former Netscreen execs iirc. Both companies have expanded their product and service offerings over the years to support security operations solutions. You tend to see Palo Alto and Fortinet used in larger enterprises who need holistic network security solutions. Normally, if a security team is looking at a Palo Alto solutions, they are probably also comparing it Fortinet and vice-versa. 

Generally speaking - cyber-security industry is very broad. You are not likely to find a single company that would cover the entire gamut of security needs for an enterprise.

So I’ve been dabbling around with the stock market and other assets for a while now, started off when I was 18 and I had a spare $1,000 to lose, so I did. 

I’ve learned a lot over the years, and I also have a business finance background, so fundamentally I have a good grasp of things and I’ve also really honed my technical analysis as well, which is what helped me score the come up I’m about to address. 

I’ve had a lot of misses, and losses, and some small wins here and there. Over the years and after taking so many Ls, I began to realise some of the bad habits I had that were crippling me.

I can’t count how many times I’ve bought a stock and it’s tanked, or I bought and sold for a small profit, then the stock runs another 300% or buying short term calls without paying close attention to the over all market trends and getting screwed. 

Anyways, I got on Robinhood last year, and I threw in about $43k total since then. I immediately was down between 2k-to 5k and then at one point I hit $70k account value and I was over the moon, but I didn’t sell the small cap EV play that erased my losses and nearly doubled my investment. Instead I rode it down 60% while I lost money on other stocks. 

Most recently, I was in a bunch of SPACs, enjoying a steady stream of losses day after day. My account was at $29K or so, down $13k over all. 

I then looked at amc when it was around $9-$10 and I liked what I was hearing, so I liquidated my entire portfolio, took that $29k and bought over 1k shares and a TON of options, all expiring 2022 or later, some ITM, most way OTM ($40)

I saw my account go from $29k to about 500k in the span of a couple weeks, and when AMC was at $68 after hitting $70+ for the first time, I had to cash out all my options, I couldn’t believe the numbers I was looking at. 

So then I had $430k and a little over 1K AMC shares. I immediately sold a covered call 6/4 $73 for a quick $11k 

I already set aside enough for the taxes and all but my problem is, I want to build a legit long term portfolio and I don’t know if it’s the right time (indices at ATH) and I don’t know if I should buy stocks and sell covered calls on them at safe prices or if I should buy leaps for 2023. Not to mention I’m not sure my list is any good at all... I bought a ton of CHPT CCIV NNDM SKLZ WKHS and AONE. I’m looking to pick up 2023 calls on PLTR and also buy stock or calls on XPEV. 

I’ve never had this much to put into a portfolio and I’m still kind of young, I don’t want to lose it all, I feel like I’ve made enough to do some legit investing that will grow over time and I no longer have to do options yolos because of being down thousands and nervous about it.

85,WKHS," Just got SUPER lucky, need advice please and thank you, reader.

So I’ve been dabbling around with the stock market and other assets for a while now, started off when I was 18 and I had a spare $1,000 to lose, so I did. 

I’ve learned a lot over the years, and I also have a business finance background, so fundamentally I have a good grasp of things and I’ve also really honed my technical analysis as well, which is what helped me score the come up I’m about to address. 

I’ve had a lot of misses, and losses, and some small wins here and there. Over the years and after taking so many Ls, I began to realise some of the bad habits I had that were crippling me.

I can’t count how many times I’ve bought a stock and it’s tanked, or I bought and sold for a small profit, then the stock runs another 300% or buying short term calls without paying close attention to the over all market trends and getting screwed. 

Anyways, I got on Robinhood last year, and I threw in about $43k total since then. I immediately was down between 2k-to 5k and then at one point I hit $70k account value and I was over the moon, but I didn’t sell the small cap EV play that erased my losses and nearly doubled my investment. Instead I rode it down 60% while I lost money on other stocks. 

Most recently, I was in a bunch of SPACs, enjoying a steady stream of losses day after day. My account was at $29K or so, down $13k over all. 

I then looked at amc when it was around $9-$10 and I liked what I was hearing, so I liquidated my entire portfolio, took that $29k and bought over 1k shares and a TON of options, all expiring 2022 or later, some ITM, most way OTM ($40)

I saw my account go from $29k to about 500k in the span of a couple weeks, and when AMC was at $68 after hitting $70+ for the first time, I had to cash out all my options, I couldn’t believe the numbers I was looking at. 

So then I had $430k and a little over 1K AMC shares. I immediately sold a covered call 6/4 $73 for a quick $11k 

I already set aside enough for the taxes and all but my problem is, I want to build a legit long term portfolio and I don’t know if it’s the right time (indices at ATH) and I don’t know if I should buy stocks and sell covered calls on them at safe prices or if I should buy leaps for 2023. Not to mention I’m not sure my list is any good at all... I bought a ton of CHPT CCIV NNDM SKLZ WKHS and AONE. I’m looking to pick up 2023 calls on PLTR and also buy stock or calls on XPEV. 

I’ve never had this much to put into a portfolio and I’m still kind of young, I don’t want to lose it all, I feel like I’ve made enough to do some legit investing that will grow over time and I no longer have to do options yolos because of being down thousands and nervous about it. 

Anyone with experience who would be kind enough to share what they would do if they were me, please don’t hesitate. I’m grateful for any time you take responding!

90,ASML," Like many posts here, I'm also fairly new to investing. I started in march of this year. I'm 27 year old and living in western Europe. I make around ~3000euro per month and can save around 1800 of this per month for the coming year, maybe year and a half. After that it is likely my cost of living will probably rise a bit so I can maybe save 1300 per month.
As of now I have around 30k in cash and 7.7k invested. I want to invest around 25k more than what I have now in the remainder of this year.
My portfolio is the following:


ETF 66% - stocks 34%


ETF

iShares core GBP 100 (4%)

iShares core World (12%)

iShares S&P 500 (12%)

van Eck vectors Real Estate (8%)

Vanguard All World High Div Yield (10%)

Vanguard All World (13%)

Vanguard Dev Europe (29%)

Vanguard S&P 500 (12%)


STOCKS

ABI (23%)

ASML (42%)

INGA (14%)

RDS (12%)

UNA (9%)

I have 2 questions for now.

1. Is there any advantage in keeping two different all world/S&P 500 ETF's? When I started out I thought it would be adding to the spreading of risk seeing as it's two different companies/funds.


2. Should I already start adding other effects like bonds, more real estate or things like gold/silver or just build my portfolio like this for now?",Frontdeal,1,/r/investing/comments/nsrjpg/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/h0q49ie/,0.009,0.902,0.088,0.9429

>The way a broker routes your order determines whether you are likely to receive the best possible price at the time your trade is placed. This is called price improvement. Price improvement is basically a sale above the bid price or a buy below the offer. Fidelity's trade execution engine, **Fidelity Dynamic Liquidity Management (FDLM)**, seeks the best available price and gives clients a high rate of price improvement.
