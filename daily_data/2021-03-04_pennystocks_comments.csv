30,CEO," Their website is shit. It is currently being redone.

That address is a PO box at a legal firm that took them public via a merger. The company is legally located in Canada, but practically they are located at facilities in Tennessee and Washington.

If you take a minute to understand the company, you won't be concerned. 

They don't need a fancy website. Mission Ready Services is essentially a holding company. Their two main wholly-owned subsidiaries are where the value is. That is Unifire and Protect the Force.

Unifire and Protect the Force's websites are also shit.

They are gov contractors. They make their business by winning contacts and fulfilling orders. They haven't yet had a need for a modern public face.

This company also has terrible investor relations, terrible branding, and terrible web presence. This is part of the reason why it is so undervalued.

Their leadership have been all military guys working on winning and fufilling contacts.

Their new CEO is a banker, who has been focusing on their internal processes, merging the systems across their subsidiaries, and getting the company finances in order for the uplisting.

His next task is investors relations and lobbying.

* He is currently meeting with institutional investors.
* Unifire has engaged Tremont Strategies Group for government relations work.
* MRS has engaged [govictory.agency](https://govictory.agency/) for updating brands, logos and websites.

Dan, one of the insiders who bought yesterday is President of Unifire. Buck is CEO of MRS. Both are bullish on their own company and working their asses off to get in order.

The superficial stuff is a mess. The actual work is ticking along smoothly, from what we can tell with the contracts being won and paid. We'll have more insight in the next few weeks when they release financials.

You can read up for yourself about the plan in the November shareholders letter and February update:

60,DD," Nah, if that's your strategy then it makes sense. I have that with my long term investments too. It depends on your mentality, I chose to sell my some of my long term pennies to secure any profits and also cut the losses in the ones I was red in. My thinking was simply 'this is going down. I don't need to go down with it.' It just allows me to be more flexible and require less gains in order to break even/make profit. And, while I don't need the money, having that much liquid means that I can reassess my portfolio. Everything is on sale atm so I don't want to be tied into certain stocks just because I'm bag holding. It might have made sense at the time to commit this much to certain stocks but now I can perhaps take money out of the pennies and buy some quality growth stocks that have dipped majorly.

67,DD," I'm seeing each one as a long-term that I'd ideally hope to see grow over the next 5-10 years. I'd rather just put money in over time/buy a significant amount of shares when a stock that I see future value in is worth very little and then keep up to date on the company/stock information but otherwise just let it grow.

I want to plant seeds. Although I might try to train myself to read charts just for my own satisfaction of learning, I can't see myself day trading or anything like that. I feel like I'm taking enough risk investing in (while favoring penny) stocks in general.. Otherwise I'm just doing my research and going with my gut on what I believe are companies that are providing products or services that I believe in.

My hopes would be that investing maybe several thousand dollars over the next year or so could plant seeds that could yield 50-100 grand within a decade. Ambitious, but hopefully not too crazy assuming I put that money in the right places and buy enough shares at a discount to ride 'em up.

I totally get ya, though. It's very easy to get swept up into any random ticker with a well written DD, regardless of how accurate the information actually is. Gotta do your fair share of research before really committing. Easy to get burnt out. lol",Withered_Sprout,2,/r/pennystocks/comments/lxsbpq/just_another_reminder_for_people_to_be_aware_of/gpoxdar/,0.01,0.73,0.26,0.996
68,PLTR," For sure man. Doesn't sound like you're doing much wrong and, definitely, you'll make the most money just by buying and holding instead of trying to time the market. I'm doing the exact same things with some of my biggest holdings. Eg I was 100% up on PLTR a month ago. Now I'm only up by like 20%. It doesn't bother me because I'm holding for the long term and not planning to sell. But I think pennies are less secure and much bigger risks. I'm long-term bullish on a lot of them but the volatility is way too heavy for me to want to ride it out. Some of these stocks took years to climb up to the levels they were and only days to fall back down. So when it goes back down heavily, it's important you're staying in because you believe in the stock and not because you're bag holding (which it sounds like you are so I wouldn't worry too much.) But it's just a reminder that some of these companies were riding unsustainable highs anyway. Like Microsoft's stock reached a high in 1999 that it didn't match again till 2015. imagine bag holding a stock for more than 15 years lol, even for a company like Microsoft. You can't predict the market but you can make sure you're taking the right level of risks and protecting your money/portfolio. 

On a side note, I really do recommend learning about charts just so you know what you're looking at and can really improve your gains.

They are now looking for CFO that can bring them to the NASDAQ.

Everything is fun when markets are green and you are getting to play a bit with constant buying and selling.  Doing DD is fun in a green market.  But it hurts when all you can do is watch and you don't even have any more to average down with.  Mental health is important.  Delete the app for a while.  Stop checking Finviz or CNN.

140,DD," Good morning!

Serious question, with the US market being an absolute massacre, do you think this’ll catch itself, or not? And if so, when? From my perspective, this looks pretty dope. I’m not American, but trading on the US markets means that right now, prices are juicy as heck. I don’t have a lot of money. I mean, I’m solvent and this won’t change. I’m not investing anything into any stock that I can’t afford to lose. However, at these prices, I’m seriously considering going towards the outer boundaries of what I’m comfortable with. Again, not over, but I’m considering maxing dipping deeper into my “fun”-funds to invest into MVIS. I believe in this company, I’ve done tons of DD and I’m already holding 5 shares, which, for me, is a considerable amount. I believe MVIS has a bright future.

However, I’m fairly new to trading. While I believe in the company, I’m not sure I trust the market. So before I double or triple my investment, I want to know from the more experienced folks: how big a chance is there that this will go down due to no fault of its own?

And also, if this keeps going down, wouldn’t it be smarter to wait another day or two to grab it at the lowest possible price?

Thanks guys, have a great day!

Edit: just to be clear, I won’t be selling my five shares, nor am I panicking. I’m just a newbie and I have general questions about the market, the answers to which I’ll take into consideration when making a decision on whether or not to go in further. I’m not considering selling any MVIS shares I already have, nor am I panicking.

In short, they are looking to leapfrog gas in developing nations and go straight to EV with infrastructure partners and grow and produce as much of the product locally to help locals rather just ship products in.

They spent [an entire ad campaign](https://www.tesla.com/blog/mythbusters-part-2-tesla-roadster-not-converted-lotus-elise) explaining the differences from the original Lotus design because of it.

> So you could say that the Tesla is similar to a Lotus Elise, except it has a totally different drivetrain , body panels, aluminum tub, rear sub-frame, brakes, ABS system, HVAC and rear suspension. The Tesla also neglects to carry over the gas tank, emissions equipment and exhaust.

We had to redesign everything,” said Musk

329,CEO," I raised my concerns in a previous thread. There seems to be a lot of noise about AABB but no substance to it.

"" A lot of things don't add up around AABB. Use of fake images is one of many things that doesn't add up. There is literally no reason for a company to use fake images.

A lot of people are shilling AABB massively but the only logical reason to even consider putting money into them is to short squeeze them, as they are massively shorted (which makes sense because they rocketed up in value and are literally a fake company, so why wouldn't you short them). Even their addresses are fake (try ringing them and see if you can get through to anyone from AABB or who is familiar with them). There is a real ""James Gilbert"" in the sector, but I am not satisfied that he has anything to do with AABB. In fact, I have seen multiple people argue that AABB is real by linking to James Gilbert's Linkedin, despite the fact that it says nothing about AABB at all. If James Gilbert had been CEO for years you'd have thought it would warrant a mention.

Another argument I see is that there is evidence they are developing some sort of crypto. There is a lot of open source crypto software and I am not satisfied that developing cryptocurrency is difficult or worthy of praise. If I was going to invest in companies developing cryptocurrencies I would choose one that is more transparent. Other arguments seem to lead back to AABB's press releases more often than not, often appealing to the fact that these press releases are automatically republished by Yahoo/Bloomberg (""This is published by Bloomberg! It must be reputable!"") despite neither attesting to the accuracy of the public information.

Even the domain name is suspicious. Why does ""AABBGoldToken"" feel the need to advertise the ticker in the website name, unless the focus of the company is convincing people to buy their shares after doing a shallow amount of research, instead of making an actual cryptocurrency likely to get adopted by the public. In my experience the more aggressively the company prioritises advertising its ticker, the more likely it is a scam.

Anyway, this was actually an effort to post. Do your own DD, put your money where you want to. A lot of people are aggressively defending AABB, and I'm sure some of them are doing it in good faith. I had a position at \~0.05 and closed it at \~.39. I am not going to touch it again, because I believe it to be a scam yet its also massively shorted, so in the short term it could go either way.

341,DD," I added 1500 shares of BTZI (BOTS) last year, knowing I'd be playing the long game. After the recent news, about 2 weeks or ago of their investment in multiple Bitcoin mines, the price shot up. I was tempted to sell at 3x, but I'm playing the long game of production results. I estimated the stock to hit a $4-5 price range long term in my DD, I particularly liked their security build of their crypto exchange as well as their investment in bitcoin mining. There was other news of a an upcoming partnership as well.  With the recent news, it wouldn't surprise me to see it achieve closer to $8 once production starts on the 1000+ rigs, so much so i have added another 5000 shares recently. I avoid the mining stocks in general if looking for a short term gain. That's the extent of the mining stocks for me. I encourage everyone to do their own DD as I'm just a regular guy with a regular job and not a professional investment expert of any kind.
