11,ES," No. The markets did not have that priced in. What they had was the possibility that all bank deposits would be insured. Yellen all but killed that, until the next banks fail, which WILL happen. 
If the Fed were to insure all deposits then two things would happen, imo. 
1. More money printed.  Unless they were just going to do some bs balance sheet transfer to assuage concerns inky to yank them later. Bullish short term but destructive long term. 
2. Risk is removed from the banking system further thereby creating a moral hazard that would result in even more inappropriate risk taking. 

Also the FDIC protects Member banks. Not all banks are members. Depending on their charter some banks are state regulated. Are those deposits going to be insured?  I digress. 

The markets are still believing that there will be a 25 bp CUT by end of 2023. As usual, the market will lag policy, until we get more bank failures. And there will be more. 

Finally, of course this was all synchronized. Yellen had what, +60 /ES to play with - room to blow shit up.  Can you imagine if it was just her statement alone today?  Bank stocks would have crashed as investors tried to figure out which banks were next in their whack a mole game. 

I have no idea directionally the market goes for the remainder of the week. But I’m not surprised that Jpowz statements did not cause a down swoop. The mkt is spinning it as dovish to neutral.

12,OP," Disclaimer :I'm highly regarded 

Puts are like an insurance policy on a companies stock, and calls are a bet on improvement at the company. A put is an option to sell at a specific price at a later date that you pay for the privilege of that locked time window. 

When you set up a put at a sale price that is high, and exercise that option when the prices drop, that's called a short position. 

Here, the comment OP had a put, or an insurance policy on a stock, and then before the meeting, that stock actually raised I price 68%. Meaning that the value of his insurance policy, his put, was less than the market rate of that stock by 68%.

At the end of the meeting, because Powell was like... That report is not our outlook, the stock market anticipated further rate increases. This caused the market to drop in general to such a degree, that the comment OPs insurance policy on his stock(put) was now a positive percentage to the extent that comment OP ""made a couple hundred dollars"" means that they were able to sale at a higher price than today's value. 

If comment OP would have sold their stock instead at the time they set up the put, then they would be in a similar position. 

Puts are a good idea if you think you should sell but aren't certain.",Bullylandlordhelp,4,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/11yyfey/this_is_the_guy_who_saved_your_puts_today_the/jdc7mox/,0.029,0.914,0.058,0.6837

14,FRC," Except that's not what Powell said. Powell is leaving open the door to the possibility that further chaos may impede their ability to raise the long term rate, forcing them to delay but not pause raising rates while they resolve the next crisis. He's essentially telegraphing a subject they just finished discussing in FOMC. 

If the FOMC were still focused on figuring out the scale of the damage from additional, post-SVB/Signature bank failures (i.e. if FRC or others had fallen), they might not have worried about a rate hike at this moment. As Powell said, additional bank failures in the short term were taking more money out than their interest rate hike could do. That's why they didn't do 50bps in this meeting.",Aarschotdachaubucha,12,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/11z2nag/4_trillion_dollar_corrective_response/jdca2x3/,0.15,0.75,0.101,-0.8469
15,VC," They're moving it from one bank to another in most cases. In the cases where its being spent down (i.e. a lot of the startups that are burning VC cash on payroll, OPEX/CAPEX, etc.) that money was going into the economy either way, regardless of which bank it sat at. 

What is happening though is a bunch of banks are getting defacto taxed to cover SVB and Signature's shortfalls on asset sales just to make sure those depositors can move banks, and that money that gets taxed will be replenishing the empty FDIC piggy bank for insurance. For the banks not affected by SVB, they're recapitalized with the funds they've borrowed, and then pay it back with minor interest to Treasury which gets to use it against the US budget anyways.",Aarschotdachaubucha,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/11z2nag/4_trillion_dollar_corrective_response/jddwgvr/,0.023,0.895,0.081,0.781

The result has been a proliferation of fake accounts that facilitated scams, resulting in Block benefitting from increased transaction-based revenue along with inflated user metrics.

**Multiple former customer service reps we interviewed** described how Cash App’s user data has been inflated by single individuals that have numerous associated accounts, sometimes numbering in the hundreds. Often these were associated with blacklisted accounts banned for fraud or other policy violations.

We studied it hard and low and behold…..people were actually putting in more time, less sick days, more productive. How do you dispute that?  
During a big push we used to rent space at a nearby hotel and travel people in.  It’s all done remote now.  Including our training!
Yes, we all check out during meetings when the camera isn’t on but that just tells you to have less meetings fuck face. People are off the roads, space is saved, more productivity.  Well…the managers like going in because they have nice offices and secretaries.  And we also have this stupid social contract that we have to artificially prop up all the businesses along the commute to work.  Wasteful.  Then covid came along and made it all that much better.

144,NYC," I used to examine banks like Signature when I was at the FDIC. Before the pandemic, I would have said it's kinda nonsense. But the pandemic has caused fundamental shifts in both policy and behavior. 

At my time at the FDIC, we generally did a full scope exam on banks at least once a year. Some get exceptions based on size and the previous exam findings. Because of the rapid rate hikes that's only just approaching a year, I can see some banks becoming distressed without it causing major ripples yet. So it's definitely possible these loans might be more distressed than initially thought. I can't recall a time where I've done an exam with the expectation of almost 500 bps increases in a year. That said, duration risk is definitely on everyone's minds now so I'm sure they're all secretly super happy about the new Fed funding and lessened standards for discount window. So I don't know. It's reasonable to assume though. 

But I do know for sure occupancy is down. At least in the NYC. I have plenty of anecdotal evidence as well regarding the work culture shift as I know a number of them now are perma-hybrid/remote work. They're all in different industries that simply need an internet connection. So yeah, I feel like there could be truth to it. 

I honestly don't follow CRE much and a lot of this research was done as I look at the broader economic activity while considering my plays. But it's been on my mind and I've been poking other people in the industry about it.",0x11C3P,11,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/11z98su/the_next_shoe_to_drop_20_trillion_in_commerical/jdbjhgu/,0.041,0.796,0.163,0.9883

271,COIN," Hey there, MIA3D! You might think this SEC vs. COIN lawsuit is gonna send the stock tumbling, but let me tell you why you should actually be bullish on $COIN, my fellow smooth-brained friend.

First off, we've got this whole global financial mess going on with the bond, bank, and security crisis, thanks to the Fed's rate hikes and money-printing shenanigans. People are losing faith in the traditional system, and guess what? Crypto is the fire exit everyone's gonna be rushing to.

And who's holding the keys to that exit? That's right, it's Coinbase. They're the only official fire exit to the fiat/bond/security banking collapse, and they're gonna be crucial when the chaos kicks in.

With China, Russia, and Saudi Arabia ditching the US currency for settling oil purchases, the traditional banking system is shaking in its boots. But guess who's already checked out? Yep, our crypto buddies.

Now, let's talk numbers. Coinbase holds over 2 million BTC, worth 50+ billion, and they've got 14,500 institutional clients like banks, hedge funds, and companies. Big dogs like Fidelity and BlackRock even use Coinbase as a counterparty risk to their at-risk bond/security/treasury holdings. That's some serious trust in COIN, folks.

Need more convincing? Cathie Wood, our favorite big-brain investor, is all in on $COIN, and she's been buying it up like there's no tomorrow. So, when the traditional system goes kaboom, people are gonna be flocking to Coinbase, and that's when we're gonna see some juicy 100x growth.

TL;DR: The SEC lawsuit might be a lil' bump in the road, but when the traditional banking system goes up in flames, Coinbase is gonna be our golden fire exit. So buckle up and hold on to your diamond hands, 'cause $COIN is ready for liftoff. 🚀

Remember, I ain't no financial advisor, but if you ask me, it's time to go long on $COIN. Good luck, fellow smooth-brain! 💎🙌",ventus83,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/11yyn64/sec_is_suing_coin/jdbo951/,0.12,0.721,0.159,0.958

[This process started last fall](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DPSACBW027SBOG)

IMO, this started the current crisis.  All banks had mark to market losses.  Those that don't have excess reserves saw the pressure first.  This will continue working it's way up the ladder swallowing the weakest reserves until treasuries recover.   

The backstops may stop ""contagion"".  And they may reduce fear and the sudden rush of a bank run.  But they will not stop the underlying problem.

Ironically, treasuries have gone up as a result of flight to safety response to the crisis.  But we do have a debt ceiling fight coming up.  This has historically caused spikes in yields.

385,GOOGL," Starting to close my long GOOGL trade that started 2/8 on the way down from the Bard presentation. Continued to add to the position on the way down. Buying as recently as 3/9. All 4/21 expiration calls with strikes ranging from $95 to $105. Market action was not what I expected during that time but overall rationale for the trade was that Bard presentation worries were overblown and with hopefully slowing inflation and fed pivot on the horizon large cap tech would rebound. 

Obviously the rational didn’t play out as expected but heavily profiting regardless. Currently sold 150 4/21 $105 calls for $4.40 that were averaged down and bought for $2.60. Also sold 45 4/21 $100 calls for 7.02 bought for $3.03. 

Currently holding 200 more contracts from $95 to $105. Will probably sell over the next two weeks. Don’t see any catalysts that will send us lower in the short term as long as the market doesn’t decide to overreact to the recent FOMC days after.
