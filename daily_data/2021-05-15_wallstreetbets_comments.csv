It has to be a legit charity. Not some gofund me account.

Here's my counter:

I'll take the theoretically unlimited risk but I want you to have some real risk too otherwise what's even the point of this. I'll wager the value of one share of GME at close of regular market at 4pm EDT Friday the 21st but I want you to put up $420.69.

Also you said above $200 so I want to see trades above $200.01 for full shares. A max of $200 would mean I win.

Finally, I want more than a single share traded above $200. Let's say a volume of at least 200 above $200 as determined by  [the nasdaq website](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/real-time) to try to make manipulation of this bet more difficult.

Other mortgage companies showed slightly more growth because of their slow closing times. UWMC’s quick closing time allowed for the rising rates to be reflected in the Q1 report while the other companies using worse tech were still closing mortgages from December and January. According to Mat the other companies will show these numbers in Q2 while UWMC is guiding higher. Of course the market doesn’t care, especially with such a newly public company and all the SPAC fear. UWMC just needs time should be in good shape by EoY.

123,UK," Do you ever go shopping? Do you buy food or gas? Has it gone up, down, or stayed the same in price?

It's gone up, so inflation is not down to used fecking cars you muppet.

I know someone here in the UK who runs a freight company, imports goods from China and sells to huge super stores.

In the last 12 months the price of a 40ft container imported from China has gone from $2500 all in, to $13,500 shipping cost plus $1500 import taxes.

That's an increase in shipping costs of 6x. A lot of the other companies he knows in the same game can't import shit, because the costs of shipping kill the profits to such an extent it isn't worth it.

So you have shortages caused by delays, with shipping running at 100%, shortages due to backlogs in manufacturing, mining, and everything else, and on top of all of this leading to price inflation you have the idiots in charge printing money like there's no tomorrow and inflating it even more.

Inflation is going to rise sharply for motnhs and probably years ahead, because the powers that be are doing nothing to help, they are making it worse.

132,CX," Good luck to you, however as a civil engineer I can tell you we don't use concrete to repair bridges and roads.

Building bridges from scratch yes a shit ton of concrete, but not for repair. Also repair is a pretty vague term - could range from anything to replacing bridge bearings, replacing expansion joints, correcting alignment or settlement issues, embankment grades etc.

Modernizing safety aspects of roads and bridges include upgrading/installing steel guardrail, crash barriers, cameras, message board signs, revising speed limits, visibility issues. etc

Don't confuse repair with construction.

*This includes funding to improve air quality, limit greenhouse gas emissions...*

Concrete is a huge producer of carbon dioxide emissions during manufacturing so that would be pretty ironic...

If you know any asphalt manufactures that may be a better play as repairing roads involves relaying sections of asphalt and filling in pot holes.

If you want to try to make money off this then look at companies who do contract work for Highway Departments i.e **civil engineering companies/contractors** and **companies engaged in the production and distribution of construction equipment and materials** like asphalt, gravel, stone, sand, cranes, trucks, etc.

I believe there is a high probability contract manufacturing will be announced at the call on Monday. I believe this because the company does not have any earnings to report, so it only makes sense they move the call up this early in Q2 to give good news. The CEO Tony Tequila is an ego maniac and surely wants a ""do over"" after the horrible call in Q1, thus why they choose to give news during the call. Also look for partnership news with ride sharing and/or medium-heavy OEMs. 

However, contract manufacturing will be on the small end and short term just to get their products to market. The company has $700M cash and their plan is build a factory to produce high volume units themselves. News about this may also be dropped on the call.

With respect to either contract manufacturing OR in-house factory plans, my crystal ball is vaguely whispering ""Kentucky"" in my ear, but I'm not sure what it means. Screenshot this, make a note, whatever. After the call come back to this comment and beg me to tell you how I knew.

On the short squeeze stuff, do I expect this to rocket up to $50 a share? No. But it's worth mentioning that the borrow fee is pretty high around 25-29% and has been for months. The past month has been one of the flattest months of trading in the stock's history, so I do suspect shorts will start getting bored and begin to unwind. There is no reason to believe this will cause a squeeze, but it will help get the stock back to a fair market price. 

Volume has been DEAD on this stock lately, and seeing that Vanguard picked up 9.5M shares last month literally blows my mind because that's an entire weeks worth of volume. 

There is so much more about this company that is missed because it's so fun and easy to shit all over EV SPACs right now. Short term catalysts aside, building a position here in the $7s is a great opportunity to get in on a long term growth company with great tech. 

So the TL;DR here is I'm expecting good news on Monday, shorts should start to fuck off and the price will recover to a more reasonable range and even if it doesn't, this long term play is worth a look.

I think this\^ comment summarizes all the BS surrounding the GOEV stock price... a lot of people who are clueless about design and consumer trends and art and stuff are apparently getting GOEV confused with Lordstown and other start-ups that look like they have about 1/10,000 of Canoo's potential. Canoo is, to me, obviously a 'top tier' EV startup... I can just take one look at their designs and employees and see them as a Tesla competitor (meaning that people like me will be choosing the Canoo over the model X, Y, or 3; and the pickup over the cyberdouchebagmobile; and Canoo's 2024 sports car over Tesla's next release potentially)... if I'm right, I guess that should pay handsomely. I've been watching every EV design for the last ten years...and I'm kind of an artist - I have very good visual taste (judgement) and I understand fashion and trends and culture...and I'm definitely planning on buying a Canoo over a Tesla folks! That tells me something, it should probably tell you something. If you don't see a Canoo and immediately think it has mass market global potential - then you and I are not alike...

Good thing about early earnings calls - companies rarely announce something like accounting errors or that they are closing the shop. Thats the only thing that could stop us apes from getting richer. But it is usually the opposite - some good news on time of good news. Future is with CLOV.

324,USA," Swiss banks have negative exchange rates currently and are offsetting that cost of having negative exchange rate by buying USA stocks that they hope will outpace the exchange rates which I think sit at -.73 

This way they increase liquidity of their own currency with inflation being able to be combated because they can buy that back with American money

325,CB," Ok putting aside the wrong terminology, this is not correct. The SNB is concerned with the valuation of the Franc given international demand for it as a safe haven currency (people stockpile it in bad times). This pushes Swiss exporters into selling at higher prices, making them less competitive. What the SNB, and any central bank, would do is sell SNB and buy up foreign currencies to stem the appreciation so it doesn't get out of hand. 

They can buy up whatever they want because of the low rates. Higher rates are more attractive to investors, hence why Turkey has been raising their interest rates to attract foreign currencies and stem the selloff of the Lira. This case with the SNB is the exact opposite. What this tells you the massive demand for the Franc, such that they can print massive amounts, buy up foreign stuff at will and still maintain negative rates to spur domestic lending.

Although it sounds nice for the Swiss and the Mises institute (which is a bit of a crank think tank, they're ideologues who hate central banks to the point of misrepresenting economic realities) thinks this should spell troubles for the SNB, the extremely low rates and inflation imply they have basically no inflation and can't get growth positive. They have been in this state for years and doesn't seem to be able to get out of it. Banks need positive rates to sustain healthy lending activities. At these slightly negative rates by the CB, we understand that lending constraints (opportunities, credit risk, general market sentiment, money demand etc.) are binding and until growth kicks up, they're gonna remain in this state of limbo.

I should add the Danes were in a similar situation with the Swiss a couple of years ago, they chose to sustain a constant devaluation of the krone and got out of the large-balance-sheet state. The SNB chose to let the franc float to very high valuations and their balance sheet ballooned trying to contain it, and they're still trying now. Should've done what the Danes with once and for all.",MinhNguyenPFL,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nclu00/the_swiss_national_banks_us_stocks_150_billion/gy6vwpz/,0.113,0.808,0.08,-0.896
