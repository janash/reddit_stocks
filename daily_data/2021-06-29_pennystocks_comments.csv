11,SPRT," **TL:DR**: The short interest % of free float *estimate* for SPRT is 73.84%, and the people calculating these estimates are pretty damn good.

/u/jacquesmioff is reporting short interest, not short volume, /u/sweljb, but I understand your reservations. The short interest is reported by the exchange (I think) every two weeks on a set schedule. In order to get the correct numbers, one can check for instance [here](https://www.nasdaqtrader.com/Trader.aspx?id=ShortInterest). That source tells you that per settlement date June 15th, there was a 5,135,884 short interest in SPRT.

Now we come to ORTEX. I was skeptical, at first, too, and yes, their numbers are *estimates* and not the actual numbers, but their system of getting to those estimates is very sophisticated.

Here's what ORTEX has to say about their estimate process: 

> ORTEX brings you the most timely and accurate Short interest data available. ORTEX short interest data is sourced from 
> the worlds largest combined pool of agent lenders, prime brokers, and broker-dealers who submit their inventory. ORTEX
> provides intra day and historical data for days to cover, shares on loan, utilisation rate, cost of borrow and freefloat on loan. 
> ORTEX also provide all relevant US exchange data and relevant institutional short holdings flags so users can access all the information available in one place.

Pretty cool, huh? And through that process, ORTEX reports a **current** (and not two weeks old) estimate of 73.84% current short interest % of freefloat for SPRT.

In case you are not quite convinced that ORTEX's way of estimating the short interest is working very well, take a look at [this screenshot comparing ORTEX's estimates (purple line) vs. the actual reported numbers (blue line) for SPRT](https://charts.stocktwits.com/production/original_349790009.png). Not perfect, but I would say pretty damn good. And in contrast to the official numbers which you get with a lag of about ten days, you get these numbers on a daily basis.

**Edit**: So ORTEX reports 6.1m shares as short interest as of now for SPRT. SPRT's float is 8.2m es per [yahoo finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SPRT/key-statistics?p=SPRT). That makes for a short interest % of float of 6.1m / 8.2m = 74.4% (the small difference to the 73.84% that ORTEX is showing is most probably due to slight differences in the calculation of the float number)",BeGoodToTheTime,36,/r/pennystocks/comments/o9z0wt/sprt_why_i_am_confident_pt_is_8_after_merger_with/h3f1kmf/,0.044,0.777,0.179,0.9956

69,ATOS," As I see some depression and panic I feel obliged to copy paste again the same for ATOS:

“ To all ATOSians, please let me mention something because I see some panic since last Friday.

When I bought ATOS at 0.91$ it jumped to 4$, from there it went to 1.50$, then it went back again to 4$ and 6$.

So we had the last drop to 4$ and then shooting to the current prices. Do you see the pattern (climbing higher with some corrections)? All that time I am holding…. I remember that when ATOS was at 4$ and dropped to 1.50$ there was discussion and panic…. So I just see the same again.

Last time that I checked nothing changed in order to affect our investment case! I will continue to HOLD and paper hands/day traders can do their part just don’t cry that you missed an opportunity!

Last thing to consider ATOS has a low float so can be volatile!

Know what you own and enjoy the ride!”",AllSeeingEye7,14,/r/pennystocks/comments/oa00cx/the_loungedaily_plays_june_29_2021/h3g975y/,0.117,0.837,0.046,-0.913

101,CBD," My actual investments remain $DTGI and $PQEFF. Both are holding steady, with DTGI getting a great 3rd party PR from a new analyst bullish coverage. 

But I'm a degenerate gambler, so today I put some small bets on INCC and EPWCF. These are both somewhat sketchy plays (INCC much more so). 
EPWCF has an interesting business, but they lost a director earlier this year, are delinquent in their filings, and subsequently have been placed on a management cease trade order. They have been communicating through the process though, and released a PR stating that financials will drop tomorrow, June 30th. Often delayed financials are not good, so I am bracing for it, but I think they MAY pull through it OK since the company has shored itself up and raised a lot of cash earlier this year. They have been expanding clinic locations this year, with three locations announced in Feb and a further six announced earlier this month. 

INCC is supposed to be partnered to roll out a bunch of CBD products... originally they were set to start on July 1st, but the company recently announced that supply/worker shortages are causing them to push this back indefinitely. The company has a bad track record with failed promises and under performance. However, they did just buy out another company earlier this year and the CBD products they will be selling look OK. If they fix their issues later this month and get the products rolled out I could see this taking off on a spike.",steveissuperman,3,/r/pennystocks/comments/oa00cx/the_loungedaily_plays_june_29_2021/h3fzxoo/,0.082,0.839,0.079,-0.2329

170,CTXR," Honestly, you won't like hearing this, but I'd consider selling all or at least scaling out so you don't end up with a loss. 

I did the same when AABB went up, I averaged up and averaged up and then when it crashed I got burned.  I went from up 7K to down 7K. 

I think CTXR had the 6/29 catalyst so the sell the news crowd sold despite not actually getting the news.  The big build up was in the weeks leading up to now, when it went from $3 to $4.5, there won't be a pop based on the news itself.  That was my 2 cents, I sold at $4.20 and have mentioned this to several people on here, but I don't want to get into a big debate with people who think I'm being pessimistic.  I love CTXR, I hate the ""sell the news"" crowd.  I'll be buying the dip eventually, but I don't see another catalyst for a bit.  

The $8+ price target is after FDA approval in early 2022, not based on this.  (That said, it could spike to $4 again in the next few days, so you may scale out 50% and then wait to see if it happens with the other 50%.

201,CTXR," Careful with this.  CTXR is on a downward trend, even though we haven't heard the news yet.  I sold at $4.2 because I've gotten burned by this in the past... even though logically it SHOULD go up based on good news, the good news kind of gets baked into the price (e.g., it went up from $3 to $4.5) and then people lock in profits or sell the news.

So I don't recommend buying this dip unless you're willing to sell when it goes up slightly ($3.6? $3.8?) and are not expecting it to go $4.5+ again.  If you're up now, or at breakeven, I'd sell anywhere between $3.4-3.8 if you think it'll go up.

So you gotta finance yourself in the market.

A bank won‘t give u shit. If the price of Bitcoin doesn‘t rise you can‘t pay the loan back anyways, and if it rises they would make more money from just buying Bitcoin themselves.

So you get liquidity from issuing shares. But why buy them? I just pay off debt of the company, personnel I don‘t need, and all other kinds of whatever the company needs to spend money for, like CEO compensation, marketing and what not, instead of just buying Bitcoin myself. For what do I need the middle man? It‘s useless, an unnecessary risk, and just costs money.

Even if (and that‘s a biiiig if, and completely fictional imo) they could mine sooo much more efficiently as every other miner on the planet (even though perfect setups are well-known all over the world - there are entire communities dedicated to finding the best price-energy consumption-hash rate GPUs and setups), the additional profits would still have to pay for any overheads you don‘t incur if you just have Bitcoin, and not a company, so:

-Salaries 
-Corporate Tax 
-Rent

245,PT," That was morgan stanleys recent PT. Will get varying opinions on that. Ultimately it boils down to- if they build driftwood- it will go up A LOT. If they dont, its almost a complete loss. The investment premise is entirley based on if you believe the project will happen or not. Personally, i think it will 80/20 chance. And i think upside is $35-40 at full capacity (5yrs). $15-20 when they issue notice to proceed to contractor (6-9 months)",E-garr,2,/r/pennystocks/comments/oa9nv9/tell_clears_an_important_hurdle_signs_long_term/h3hdj9q/,0.026,0.948,0.026,-0.0056
246,MMAT," I am definitely not selling shit. Since the price at XTB TRCH ticker is following MMAT ticker I am staying in with my investment. I don't care how ticker is named and what fuckery my broker is doing. They had to sell my shares before merger, they didn't. Now if they sell my shares I sue them. If I sell my shares with profit then I transfer all my crash out of them. 

What I am considering is requesting share transfer to fuck back with my broker.",brewlee,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/oa67vy/hello_i_was_said_people_here_might_help_me/h3hguik/,0.092,0.728,0.18,0.7576
247,MMAT," TRCH stop existing and was merged with MMATF becoming MMAT. 

For every 2 shares of TRCH, you get 1 share of MMAT. If you had 100 shares of TRCH at $5. 

Then you will end up with 50 shares at $10 but because there was a sell off on Monday of 20% and another of 10%. Share price is right now at $7. I couldnt sell on Monday because the ticker was not fixed on my broker platform and was only possible at noon.

Those with MMATF shares got fked even harder.

I was only able to sell off today at $7.00",zethras,2,/r/pennystocks/comments/oa67vy/hello_i_was_said_people_here_might_help_me/h3hj2e5/,0.015,0.869,0.116,0.8126
