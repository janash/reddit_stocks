27,REAL," I decided to use the last green day to do a bit of rebalancing to increase the cash position to about 10% (probably shoulda sold a tad more sooner but oh well). 

I am now being quite patient with that money. Between the earnings season farce and this multi-layer correction which likely isn't over, I am now more convinced than ever that many yolo into dips way too hard and soon.

Even if it means missing the absolute best prices. I spent 2 days trying to catch the falling with SHOP which I bought a touch too soon a few weeks ago and quickly stopped when I realized there was a good case to be made that this will probably get worse before it gets better.

Also, if the gunpowder in on my account runs out and things get REAL serious, I also can dip into my savings which i actively look to keep rather high at all times. Personally, I don't buy the 6 month rule and opt to save for 1 year's worth of overhead and potential expenses. Liquid cash may lose to inflation but it also won't get shredded by the market when it throws a fit. So I have that to fall on too if gets real bad.

29,DD," I think buying the dip and dollar cost averaging is two separate strategies. DCA as you are practicing it is blind purchasing which averages out the purchasing highs and lows. Buying the dip is aiming to purchase the lows and hoping that you were correct.  
My father in law is the buy the dip guy. The does DD on companies he is interested in, has the price he thinks is the low and set the limit buy on that price, and holds cash until that limit buy is triggered. I believe he updates the qty and the price once in a while to better reflect the changing circumstances and the increase in the cash available.  
You could also do a hybrid type of plan where you hold a certain percentage in cash to buy the dip and the rest of the amount gets blindly thrown in for the DCA. For example, if I plan on holding 30% in cash for the dip buying and I put $1000 into the account, I will spend 700 for DCA and hold 300 in the account for the dip buying later.",WatchandThings,3,/r/stocks/comments/nban9p/where_do_people_find_money_to_buy_the_dip_every/gxz6dsv/,0.044,0.889,0.067,0.6597

I feel like with my friends, we engage in heavy tech talk and the expansion and dependence of Semiconductors. Which is why I tend to gravitate towards tech stocks that's been working in my favor since I started my portfolio.

Basically, I go long. I'm budgeting myself based on my student loans, cost of living, and when I see to it that I have an extra grand here and there, that's when I plan ahead.

53,ROIC," Yeah I get what you're saying. I just meant value in equities should probably take into consideration macroeconomics.

I'm sure others here have a way better understanding of this and can explain it far better than me but as an example, lower interest rates keep present value of future cash flows higher. So a company's discounted cash flow is more likely to be higher than the current cost meaning an investment is more likely to give a higher ROI, *relatively speaking.

Maybe in simpler terms, you value a company, look at its ratios, ROIC, see it has a decent moat, etc. but don't invest since when you see its earnings, you believe treasuries or even money in the bank gives you better returns when factoring in risk. But if cash is less valuable because of lower interest rates or the fact the Fed is pumping trillions of it into the economy, you're more inclined to accept a higher P/E ratio since investing in the company is now more likely to give you better returns (factoring higher risk).

Not financial advice though, more so that smart people can correct me where I have gone astray.

If you're price-conscious in the US, you buy a used car.

That's why their projection is so jaw-dropping to me.  If they are selling only 15% fully electric in 2030, that means that the stock of 'affordable' cars is still going to be mostly ICE into 2035-2040, and likely much longer since they cannot instantly ramp up to 100% fully electric.

Also investing in DKNG is not a mistake.

342,TSLA," You are confusing Elon using that coin as a medium to scam rather than the coin itself being a scam. It's no different than pump and dump crypto scams, which obviously do exist. 

I've been investing in crypto pre 2015. There are great projects, but they usually get overshadowed by actual scams. I've made many comments on my thoughts on crypto, but you are just being defensive with no real commentary other than stating people who have more invested know better.

No one said it was a death note for crypto, but it might catalyze a trend reversal in overall sentiment and for TSLA and that sector. Elon has a lot of power, and honestly, he shouldn't. TSLA's initial buy was a signal of adoption, just like banks buying in. But I am sure you already know the phases to crypto adoption, so you should know how critical this is. 

In addition, that specific coin is supposed to be deflationary and a store of value. It should have absolutely ripped on all the news this week. To me that is a sign that people do not actually view it in the way they say they do, or they are overleveraged and it is indeed in a bubble. Even within the crypto community, most agree that we will hit winter again sometime soon. Personally, I believe it is when the Fed eases on QE relatively soon.

Either way, no one is debating that some crypto has some use. The issue is that most people do not care about that and are using it for its votality so it's being used as a ponzi scheme. It doesn't help when crypto is owned by a small majority of whales in each coin. This year people are really questioning banks and the fed, but at the same time, some regulation is great and needed for retail protection. That isn't happening in this sector. That's why we have so many scam coins and people will get burned, and then never invest in that sector again

Edit: wanted to add, I've posted this before. People get so touchy about their investments. I've been in pump and dump stocks before, and when I've been told they are a pump and dump, I'm not like nah, youre too stupid to understand.

346,FB," If you're asking why Alibaba earned 22bn in Net income and is trading at 26pe ratio with 30% growth and it's down the reason is below:

People aren't focusing on the PE ratio or the fine. It's because a lot of their profit comes from investment income.

We've gone from a bull to bear market, and China is watching Alibaba's investments like a hawk.

Another company that also has lots of income from investments is Softbank who reported their results too.

Softbank's Net income was a whopping 46bn for the year - which is higher than FB and GOOGL.

But why is it trading at just 135bn market cap? Because of that 46bn income, a lot of it comes from trading other companies. Their vision fund segment. It's not income that consistently repeats itself every year.

They made like 40bn alone from that segment. Their softbank business - the one with recurring income, made 7.7bn before tax and their ARM segment made a loss.

Alibaba made half of their income from recurring operations and half from investments. So their PE based on their consistent, recurring income is 51.

What multiple should the investment side be? 

For softbank, if we calculated based on their total net income their PE is just 3. But no one calculates based off investment returns repeating. If we base their PE on the recurring income, its closer to 20.

That's why you can't use straight PE for companies that make significant amounts of money from investments. Investment side of the business, PE can't be more than 20 IMO. Probably closer to 10x for an average return year. A killer quarter (like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley), investors don't push up the price as they don't expect super good years to repeat itself.

That's why you can't use straight PE for companies that make significant amounts of money from investments. Investment side of the business, PE can't be more than 20 IMO. Probably closer to 10x for an average return year. A killer quarter (like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley), investors don't push up the price as they don't expect super good years to repeat itself.

Just for reference, Alibaba non-operational income over the years: 51, 10, 27, 48, 79, 80. It can jump all over the place throwing out PE ratio.",wearahat03,12,/r/stocks/comments/nbeuca/alibaba_group_announces_march_quarter_and_full/gxz1icz/,0.071,0.885,0.044,-0.9191

351,AMZN," We can work in reverse.

AMZN had 37% growth in fiscal 2020 - PE is 60. 44% growth for the quarter.

FB has 21% growth in fiscal 2020 - PE is 30. 47% growth for the quarter.

BABA had 40% growth in fiscal 2020. 64% growth for the quarter.

10 PE for their investment business means their main business is 42 PE. But in any case, you would expect their PE to be a lot higher given their growth. (The more you value their investment business, the less you value their main business)

That's where margins come in.

AMZN's gross margins have improved over the years (5% vs 5 years ago)

FB gross margins have deteriorated. 

Which camp does BABA fall into?

Weakening margins.

They had 33% gross margin for the quarter, and 41% for the year.

5 years ago they had 66% gross margins. Last year they had 45% gross margins.

Nobody knows whether we're going to see a major correction in the short term, and we don't know what's going to happen when some of the stimulative/relief measures are reduced.  However, I'd say that it's likely that the *economy* is going to do quite well over the next couple of years -- pent up demand, high current savings rate, strong continued government support.  That doesn't mean the market will perform well -- at these prices, stocks seem to be pricing in all of this and more already.

But pulling out of the market -- what drove you to do it? Do you have a need for that $450k in the near term such that if it was priced downward, you would have a cash crunch? Or is it the psychological hit of seeing that $450k go to $300k on the brokerage screen?  If it's the latter, I'd ask: what was your basis and your expectations? If your basis was $200k 4 years ago and you wanted to do a 10% annual return, a drop to $300k is still in line with your goals! I like to think about the trend line I'm trying to achieve...sometimes the market will price above it and sometime below it, but if the long term is on or above the line, then I'm still doing what I set out to do.

371,NVAX," I'm bleeding on NVAX with @ 194 but I am pretty confident in the long term prospects. They just postponed a little bit their delivery of vaccines and approvals, nothing too serious. For those holding some cash, I would say they might use this as an opportunity to get in, because this is a brutal discount. There is definitely one catalyst - final approval coming next month. CEO stated that they will be very happy to share the results, which in my opinion suggests that their vaccine is performing exceptionally well.   


Apart from NVAX, I'm hurting with Palantir (but as a long term investor this will eventually rebound), semiconductors, real estate, oil, and also fukin Chewy (again, this is a long term play that will eventually increase massively).  


Not looking at my portfolio is the only thing that keeps me sane in those two last weeks. But why would I care about it now? Do I need cash? No!

Down $40 on it as I thankfully only got a partial share but I may consider lobbing it off just to further streamline my holdings and get that little bit more cash in hands.

609,OR," It's a terrible investment. The business strategy is predicated on giving women the advantage, when every dating site/app that's been around has already had a massive advantage/tilt in favor of women. The only thing they can run on is ""built by women, for women"".  
   
The issue is their UX is shitty for 50% of the population, and even worse considering that 50% can't even initiate conversation. I've had great dates from Bumble, BUT 70% of my matches lead to the girl not ever messaging me OR just saying ""hey!"" which is a non-starter.  
   
Men make up the vast majority of the online dating scene, and to handicap yourself by not letting them participate equally is bad business. Hinge is *far* superior here in NY. Bumble tried to copy them with prompts, but I expect it to fall flat.  
   
I've heard they also are sketchy about paying users. In that, Tinder and Hinge count a ""paid subscriber"" as someone who actually pays for a monthly subscription. Bumble counts a ""paid subscriber"" as anyone who has ever paid for a single thing on the app in the given time period, even if it was a $2.99 single use item, for example.",AnySimple4354,16,/r/stocks/comments/nbhru4/bumble_bmbl_non_hyped_value/gxzkns3/,0.054,0.884,0.062,0.126

Idk, I don't necessarily disagree with you, but I don't think the app is useless either. You also have to be subscribed before you can pretty much use any of the app, so they do have a decent and cost-effective pricing model for their users.

I work for a major aircraft manufacturer, and use their products daily. They've got the entire process of aircraft development locked down: design (Catia), analysis (Abaqus),  PLM (Enovia). They've even started a cloud service for technical document storage (Exalead).

They've been growing revenue at a 20% clip. And are continuously expanding. They've recently set their sites in Health & Life Sciences and the construction industry. Which may eat into Autodesk's Autocad, but that moat might be pretty wide.

CTXR- if you are on the fence you wait until 5/17 ER. Then jump off or stick around.

796,AAPL," Imo very bullish for the next few years especially with top of the market macs with new chips, increasing revenue from services/subscriptions, continued iPhone sales. Any apple car announce would also easily bolt on 10%+ on the stock. 

In 2018 when Apple was the first company to hit 1T market cap, a time when they were criticised for no innovation, no more growth, they doubled their market caps in just 2 years. Now there’s more catalysts and I 100% believe there is so much more growth. I’m at a 2% loss but already tempted to make AAPL closer to 50% of my portfolio.

Whether you like their products or not, they’re everywhere and their revenue growth it still insane. 90B buyback should also add ~4% to share value",theepicone111,9,/r/stocks/comments/nbho2z/is_anyone_else_losing_confidence_in_apple_stock/gxze9i7/,0.072,0.773,0.154,0.8915

798,IMO," My anecdotal evidence is I hate apple products but everyone around me seems to love them. I don't like how apple always seems to need to have specialized aspects on their products that make compatibility a nightmare. IMO wildly overpriced, over hyped products.

801,GM," Why would Tesla be the leader? GM and Volkswagen are both releasing dozen of EV models over the next few years. They already have the production plants to smoke Tesla's output, the relationships to produce cars cheaper, and dealerships to establish a global presence all the way down to the smallest towns. They have an army of certified mechanics who can work on them anywhere, and the branding to get their customers to switch. Tesla already only makes money thanks to government subsidies, and every competitor that comes out will only serve to make it that much harder.

If you want to argue that they, and they alone will crack autonomous driving, or will in some other way have a breakthrough that no one else can match, that's a different argument, and that's fine. I don't see that happening, and as such my valuation of fair market price for Tesla is so far off its current price that it's not worth even discussing. I can think of a large number of smarter investments than Tesla, but I get the hype.",JDinvestments,0,/r/stocks/comments/nbm8lq/investing_25k_in_tesla_stock/gy051uv/,0.044,0.904,0.052,0.1071

803,NET," 
 - Will Tesla be around in ten years? Likely, yes.    
 - Will they be worth *more* in ten years? Likely, yes.    
 - Is there a real risk they could move sideways for several years in-between due to being overbought?   
 - Will a 10-year Tesla investment *beat* benchmarks like VTI/VOO/etc?   

Everyone discussing this says yes to the first two questions then ignores the second two questions. That's the ""gotcha"" with Tesla, you can believe that they're an amazing company with a bright future and yet still avoid them at the current price.    

Same story with NET by the way. I think Cloudflare are incredible, but I'm not touching them at even close to $70. They'll either drop suddenly or move sideways until fairly priced.
