27,REAL," I decided to use the last green day to do a bit of rebalancing to increase the cash position to about 10% (probably shoulda sold a tad more sooner but oh well). 

I am now being quite patient with that money. Between the earnings season farce and this multi-layer correction which likely isn't over, I am now more convinced than ever that many yolo into dips way too hard and soon. Nailing the bottom is darn near impossible so I've been realizing it's probably not a bad idea to have a bit of discipline and wait to get enough data to feel more comfortable about averaging down. Even if it means missing the absolute best prices. I spent 2 days trying to catch the falling with SHOP which I bought a touch too soon a few weeks ago and quickly stopped when I realized there was a good case to be made that this will probably get worse before it gets better.

Also, if the gunpowder in on my account runs out and things get REAL serious, I also can dip into my savings which i actively look to keep rather high at all times. Personally, I don't buy the 6 month rule and opt to save for 1 year's worth of overhead and potential expenses. Liquid cash may lose to inflation but it also won't get shredded by the market when it throws a fit. So I have that to fall on too if gets real bad.

29,DD," I think buying the dip and dollar cost averaging is two separate strategies. DCA as you are practicing it is blind purchasing which averages out the purchasing highs and lows. Buying the dip is aiming to purchase the lows and hoping that you were correct.  
My father in law is the buy the dip guy. The does DD on companies he is interested in, has the price he thinks is the low and set the limit buy on that price, and holds cash until that limit buy is triggered. I believe he updates the qty and the price once in a while to better reflect the changing circumstances and the increase in the cash available.  
You could also do a hybrid type of plan where you hold a certain percentage in cash to buy the dip and the rest of the amount gets blindly thrown in for the DCA. For example, if I plan on holding 30% in cash for the dip buying and I put $1000 into the account, I will spend 700 for DCA and hold 300 in the account for the dip buying later.",WatchandThings,3,/r/stocks/comments/nban9p/where_do_people_find_money_to_buy_the_dip_every/gxz6dsv/,0.044,0.889,0.067,0.6597

I feel like with my friends, we engage in heavy tech talk and the expansion and dependence of Semiconductors. Which is why I tend to gravitate towards tech stocks that's been working in my favor since I started my portfolio.

Basically, I go long. I'm budgeting myself based on my student loans, cost of living, and when I see to it that I have an extra grand here and there, that's when I plan ahead.

53,ROIC," Yeah I get what you're saying. I just meant value in equities should probably take into consideration macroeconomics.

I'm sure others here have a way better understanding of this and can explain it far better than me but as an example, lower interest rates keep present value of future cash flows higher. So a company's discounted cash flow is more likely to be higher than the current cost meaning an investment is more likely to give a higher ROI, *relatively speaking.

Maybe in simpler terms, you value a company, look at its ratios, ROIC, see it has a decent moat, etc. but don't invest since when you see its earnings, you believe treasuries or even money in the bank gives you better returns when factoring in risk. But if cash is less valuable because of lower interest rates or the fact the Fed is pumping trillions of it into the economy, you're more inclined to accept a higher P/E ratio since investing in the company is now more likely to give you better returns (factoring higher risk).

Not financial advice though, more so that smart people can correct me where I have gone astray.

That's why their projection is so jaw-dropping to me.  If they are selling only 15% fully electric in 2030, that means that the stock of 'affordable' cars is still going to be mostly ICE into 2035-2040, and likely much longer since they cannot instantly ramp up to 100% fully electric.

The tradeoff is that these shares are on a timer for their value which is where you get into the Greeks, and other things like IV crush. If shits goes south or even flat the calls can go to zero even if AAPL is just fine, shares only hit zero of bankruptcy is declared. All risk vs reward.

342,TSLA," You are confusing Elon using that coin as a medium to scam rather than the coin itself being a scam. It's no different than pump and dump crypto scams, which obviously do exist. 

I've been investing in crypto pre 2015. There are great projects, but they usually get overshadowed by actual scams. I've made many comments on my thoughts on crypto, but you are just being defensive with no real commentary other than stating people who have more invested know better.

No one said it was a death note for crypto, but it might catalyze a trend reversal in overall sentiment and for TSLA and that sector. Elon has a lot of power, and honestly, he shouldn't. TSLA's initial buy was a signal of adoption, just like banks buying in. But I am sure you already know the phases to crypto adoption, so you should know how critical this is. 

In addition, that specific coin is supposed to be deflationary and a store of value. It should have absolutely ripped on all the news this week. To me that is a sign that people do not actually view it in the way they say they do, or they are overleveraged and it is indeed in a bubble. Even within the crypto community, most agree that we will hit winter again sometime soon. Personally, I believe it is when the Fed eases on QE relatively soon.

Either way, no one is debating that some crypto has some use. The issue is that most people do not care about that and are using it for its votality so it's being used as a ponzi scheme. It doesn't help when crypto is owned by a small majority of whales in each coin. This year people are really questioning banks and the fed, but at the same time, some regulation is great and needed for retail protection. That isn't happening in this sector. That's why we have so many scam coins and people will get burned, and then never invest in that sector again

Edit: wanted to add, I've posted this before. People get so touchy about their investments. I've been in pump and dump stocks before, and when I've been told they are a pump and dump, I'm not like nah, youre too stupid to understand.

346,FB," If you're asking why Alibaba earned 22bn in Net income and is trading at 26pe ratio with 30% growth and it's down the reason is below:

People aren't focusing on the PE ratio or the fine. It's because a lot of their profit comes from investment income.

We've gone from a bull to bear market, and China is watching Alibaba's investments like a hawk.

Another company that also has lots of income from investments is Softbank who reported their results too.

Softbank's Net income was a whopping 46bn for the year - which is higher than FB and GOOGL.

But why is it trading at just 135bn market cap? Because of that 46bn income, a lot of it comes from trading other companies. Their vision fund segment. It's not income that consistently repeats itself every year.

They made like 40bn alone from that segment. Their softbank business - the one with recurring income, made 7.7bn before tax and their ARM segment made a loss.

Alibaba made half of their income from recurring operations and half from investments. So their PE based on their consistent, recurring income is 51.

What multiple should the investment side be? 

For softbank, if we calculated based on their total net income their PE is just 3. But no one calculates based off investment returns repeating. If we base their PE on the recurring income, its closer to 20.

That's why you can't use straight PE for companies that make significant amounts of money from investments. Investment side of the business, PE can't be more than 20 IMO. Probably closer to 10x for an average return year. A killer quarter (like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley), investors don't push up the price as they don't expect super good years to repeat itself.

348,IMO," If you're asking why Alibaba earned 22bn in Net income and is trading at 26pe ratio with 30% growth and it's down the reason is below:

People aren't focusing on the PE ratio or the fine. It's because a lot of their profit comes from investment income.

We've gone from a bull to bear market, and China is watching Alibaba's investments like a hawk.

Another company that also has lots of income from investments is Softbank who reported their results too.

Softbank's Net income was a whopping 46bn for the year - which is higher than FB and GOOGL.

But why is it trading at just 135bn market cap? Because of that 46bn income, a lot of it comes from trading other companies. Their vision fund segment. It's not income that consistently repeats itself every year.

They made like 40bn alone from that segment. Their softbank business - the one with recurring income, made 7.7bn before tax and their ARM segment made a loss.

Alibaba made half of their income from recurring operations and half from investments. So their PE based on their consistent, recurring income is 51.

What multiple should the investment side be? 

For softbank, if we calculated based on their total net income their PE is just 3. But no one calculates based off investment returns repeating. If we base their PE on the recurring income, its closer to 20.

That's why you can't use straight PE for companies that make significant amounts of money from investments. Investment side of the business, PE can't be more than 20 IMO. Probably closer to 10x for an average return year. A killer quarter (like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley), investors don't push up the price as they don't expect super good years to repeat itself.

AMZN's gross margins have improved over the years (5% vs 5 years ago)

For those holding some cash, I would say they might use this as an opportunity to get in, because this is a brutal discount. There is definitely one catalyst - final approval coming next month. CEO stated that they will be very happy to share the results, which in my opinion suggests that their vaccine is performing exceptionally well.   


Apart from NVAX, I'm hurting with Palantir (but as a long term investor this will eventually rebound), semiconductors, real estate, oil, and also fukin Chewy (again, this is a long term play that will eventually increase massively).

571,DD," I understand what your saying. I should of included that in Saskatchewan, it is the only place in the world where helium is extracted as the primary product, NOT a by-product of natural gas. This means that will save a ton in costs. The helium can literally be sold directly from the well head. How they will separate the gases and transport it is in my original post.

There is no storing it and waiting for the price to go up. The price of helium has already gone up and will continue to go up... They literally extract it from the well head and ship it to the processing facility. A few years from now they will have built their own facility....

These Royal Helium wells are situated really close to the Canada/USA border. They can literally drive the helium to the processing plant in roughly 6 hrs in sealed cylinders. This will start generating the companies first revenue. It‚Äôs been years in the making and a long process.

This means that will save a ton in costs. The helium can literally be sold directly from the well head. How they will separate the gases and transport it is in my original post.

There is no storing it and waiting for the price to go up. The price of helium has already gone up and will continue to go up... They literally extract it from the well head and ship it to the processing facility. A few years from now they will have built their own facility....

These Royal Helium wells are situated really close to the Canada/USA border. They can literally drive the helium to the processing plant in roughly 6 hrs in sealed cylinders. This will start generating the companies first revenue. It‚Äôs been years in the making and a long process.

609,OR," It's a terrible investment. The business strategy is predicated on giving women the advantage, when every dating site/app that's been around has already had a massive advantage/tilt in favor of women. The only thing they can run on is ""built by women, for women"".  
   
The issue is their UX is shitty for 50% of the population, and even worse considering that 50% can't even initiate conversation. I've had great dates from Bumble, BUT 70% of my matches lead to the girl not ever messaging me OR just saying ""hey!"" which is a non-starter.  
   
Men make up the vast majority of the online dating scene, and to handicap yourself by not letting them participate equally is bad business. Hinge is *far* superior here in NY. Bumble tried to copy them with prompts, but I expect it to fall flat.  
   
I've heard they also are sketchy about paying users. In that, Tinder and Hinge count a ""paid subscriber"" as someone who actually pays for a monthly subscription. Bumble counts a ""paid subscriber"" as anyone who has ever paid for a single thing on the app in the given time period, even if it was a $2.99 single use item, for example.",AnySimple4354,16,/r/stocks/comments/nbhru4/bumble_bmbl_non_hyped_value/gxzkns3/,0.054,0.884,0.062,0.126

Idk, I don't necessarily disagree with you, but I don't think the app is useless either. You also have to be subscribed before you can pretty much use any of the app, so they do have a decent and cost-effective pricing model for their users.

I work for a major aircraft manufacturer, and use their products daily. They've got the entire process of aircraft development locked down: design (Catia), analysis (Abaqus),  PLM (Enovia). They've even started a cloud service for technical document storage (Exalead).

They've been growing revenue at a 20% clip. And are continuously expanding. They've recently set their sites in Health & Life Sciences and the construction industry. Which may eat into Autodesk's Autocad, but that moat might be pretty wide. But I will say, having used both software, Catia is a much better product (which I imagine will be similar to Dassault's civil engineering offering).

785,TDOC," TDOC is trading at 20x revenue - still high on valuation. Remember, pre pandemic it was $140. Many stocks are trading now at their 52 week lows, which means TDOC can easily go down to that too (and their valuation would still be 15x revenue which is quite high). So looks like more downside than upside in an upcoming choppy market. Price you bought it at doesnt matter - what matters is if you think there is more upside or downside from the current value.

796,AAPL," Imo very bullish for the next few years especially with top of the market macs with new chips, increasing revenue from services/subscriptions, continued iPhone sales. Any apple car announce would also easily bolt on 10%+ on the stock. 

In 2018 when Apple was the first company to hit 1T market cap, a time when they were criticised for no innovation, no more growth, they doubled their market caps in just 2 years. Now there‚Äôs more catalysts and I 100% believe there is so much more growth. I‚Äôm at a 2% loss but already tempted to make AAPL closer to 50% of my portfolio.

801,GM," Why would Tesla be the leader? GM and Volkswagen are both releasing dozen of EV models over the next few years. They already have the production plants to smoke Tesla's output, the relationships to produce cars cheaper, and dealerships to establish a global presence all the way down to the smallest towns. They have an army of certified mechanics who can work on them anywhere, and the branding to get their customers to switch. Tesla already only makes money thanks to government subsidies, and every competitor that comes out will only serve to make it that much harder.

If you want to argue that they, and they alone will crack autonomous driving, or will in some other way have a breakthrough that no one else can match, that's a different argument, and that's fine. I don't see that happening, and as such my valuation of fair market price for Tesla is so far off its current price that it's not worth even discussing. I can think of a large number of smarter investments than Tesla, but I get the hype.",JDinvestments,0,/r/stocks/comments/nbm8lq/investing_25k_in_tesla_stock/gy051uv/,0.044,0.904,0.052,0.1071

803,NET," 
 - Will Tesla be around in ten years? Likely, yes.    
 - Will they be worth *more* in ten years? Likely, yes.    
 - Is there a real risk they could move sideways for several years in-between due to being overbought?   
 - Will a 10-year Tesla investment *beat* benchmarks like VTI/VOO/etc?   

Everyone discussing this says yes to the first two questions then ignores the second two questions. That's the ""gotcha"" with Tesla, you can believe that they're an amazing company with a bright future and yet still avoid them at the current price.    

Same story with NET by the way. I think Cloudflare are incredible, but I'm not touching them at even close to $70. They'll either drop suddenly or move sideways until fairly priced.
