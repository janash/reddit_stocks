16,ALL," A lot of negative sentiment on TWTR in this thread. 10:1 ratio of negative comments? As expected since the stock is down +15% the last few weeks and down +25% from it's peak a few months ago. 

I'll be the contrarian side (as I am an investor and will be looking to add to my position):

* TWTR beat on basically ALL year-on-year metrics from 2019 Q1. mDAU, earnings, profits, and income. Most notably in net income from -$8B to $68M. That's a +$70B swing.

* TWTR beat analyst estimates on both Q1 top & bottom EPS and revenue. Most notably a +$10M beat on quarterly revenue. However it missed 1M in mDAU.

* So TWTR has double digit beats on all metrics YtY. Beat estimates. Beats 2019 Q1/Q2/Q3 (Q4 was a seasonal high). But the stock drops double digits. Not really rational. But why? Answer is **mDAU**

* For years TWTR has low revenue and profits because it was focused on maximum growth. Back then it would tell investors to look at their mDAU to judge their value. So mDAU didn't meet analyst expectations. But do look at the notes. mDAU **INCREASED  20%** to 199M vs 200M. It's not less than last quarter. It's not less than last year. It's MORE, but **0.5%** miss from analyst expectations.

* I think a lot of the ""pandemic winners"" are getting shot down because some will not be winning as much reopening. Sometimes it is right. Other times I think it's not. I never thought of TWTR as one of those companies that *needed* the pandemic. I never engaged with TWTR on my computer. It's always been on mobile, via notifications, when others tell me their handle, when tweets reverberate through media, or when things are HAPPENING (sports, elections, cancelling karens, news, etcetc). I don't think that will change once things reopen. People will still check their phones while mobile, traveling, or outside. Last I checked everyone media/celeb/politican still has a @whatever and trends still run on #.

Do I think TWTR had this downside coming? Yes. They talked up their huge game during investor day and everyone ate it up because they were coming off a huge 2020Q4 beat. That's also why analysts have set these high bars while investors ran up the stock. Also why I unwillingly SOLD some shares despite really liking the company and wanting to hold long. Another thing is that TWTR was the one that told wallstreet to judge them by mDAU in the past rather than using earnings. That is coming back to bite them now that they are shifting focus from maximum user growth to growth+earnings.

Some of the comments are solid on questioning the slowing growth rate, how well they will fare post-covid, their ability to roll out their suggested new features, continued monetization, and competition with FAAMG and newer platforms snap/tiktok for both users and more importantly investors(themselves). But others are straight up silly or wrong like they are talking about TWTR from 2015-16. No earnings? Losses? Decline? IBM? Text-based? It's like they know nothing of the company and didn't even bother to read the bullet points in OP.

TWTR will be fine. It's shifting from user growth to monetization. It's growing on all fronts (including users. *TWTR slowing in the growth rate of their user growth.*) and missed analyst projections on mDAU by 0.5%. mDAU was something TWTR invented for analysts/investors to judge them in the past. Do I think it's logical that there is a 25% decline on double digit growth on all fronts, but a 0.5% mDAU miss? No, but I didn't think it was rational either when it hit $80+ after investor day either. 

I'm not selling and looking to pick up more sub-$52.

29,FB," I take the exact opposite stance on Pinterest and most of their data does too.  Pinterest views and activity translates pretty cleanly into purchase intention for advertisers whereas Snapchat and FB have a much worse signal since looking at pictures of your friends and the crap they're doing doesn't really translate as well into a purchasing decision.  Really the biggest thing Pinterest needs to continue doing is refining the offerings it has for advertiser and moving purchasing capability onto the site as well as expanding the ability of its users/influencers to put together projects and offer curated projects/planning.  They've done extremely well when it comes to improving monetization, do not face nearly the same privacy headwinds as other social companies and are fairly early into the process too.  Now obviously they're more aggressively valued than something like Facebook too and that needs to be considered but it's got a lot of value as an advertising platform alone that's only going to increase as they improve their targeting capabilities and enable on platform purchases.",ObservationalHumor,0,/r/investing/comments/n1i2a5/twitter_q1_revenue_of_104b_288_yy/gwfe7zi/,0.043,0.815,0.141,0.9364

31,CC," I mean Pinterest tends to offer more options with the attribution window as I understand it and I think for a while their sponsored pins were a default of 90 days too so I'm not sure that's the best metric here.

Facebook definitely has better targeting capabilities for certain kinds of adds based primarily on demographics data or interests but Pinterest is great for targeting people looking for specific items or services to purchase.  If you're actually selling goods and targeting women in particular it's a great choice and the economics line up pretty favorably in a lot of cases.  Obviously if you're doing something public service messages or trying to build website traffic based on certain interests something like Facebook is going to be a lot stronger though.

At any rate pretty much all the statistics I've seen point to people using Pinterest specifically with the intention to purchase things and according to their last CC shopping related search volume was up 20 fold YoY in the last quarter.  There's definitely some design and maturity issues they still need to work through to really fully leverage the platform they've built but it's getting there.",ObservationalHumor,1,/r/investing/comments/n1i2a5/twitter_q1_revenue_of_104b_288_yy/gwgzv08/,0.007,0.775,0.218,0.993

Some people think running market neutral - like 100% long, 100% short - has lower risk.  I don't agree, and have seen countless funds that run in that range fail.  Bad companies tend to go up a lot faster than the general market (they have higher beta) and if the market roars up, a neutral portfolio won't seem so neutral.

For individual shorts without a catalyst, .5-3% sizing works well.  Smaller for the microcap junk, larger for stuff like AAL or CS.

Bad companies tend to go up a lot faster than the general market (they have higher beta) and if the market roars up, a neutral portfolio won't seem so neutral.

For individual shorts without a catalyst, .5-3% sizing works well.  Smaller for the microcap junk, larger for stuff like AAL or CS.  Bet bigger than this on shorts at your peril - even this size has plenty of risk.  Make sure individual shorts aren't too correlated.  What happened late January is shorts mostly became super correlated, and things get dangerous fast.",daveyorr,9,/r/investing/comments/n1mz3k/longshort_personal_portfolio_construction/gwefz00/,0.122,0.79,0.088,-0.7105
34,GME," >In bull markets, I find myself drawn to shorting highly volatile stocks because anything with decent fundamentals seems like a bad choice...but that accordingly increases the drawdowns in my portfolio

Volatile stocks in bull rallies ***tend*** to go up more than those with strong fundamentals. If you could effectively time the ending of a bear market, the best strategy would be to literally buy the shittiest companies possible as the transition from risk off shifts into incrementally higher risk-taking. So I would be careful of this.

Of course, the issue is generally that they also decline more in a shift into a bear market. Regardless, I would be careful with this since it just leaves you super vulnerable to getting squeezed. It also tends to be a bit of a crowded strategy - IE, it's too obvious and is vulnerable to unwinds from large players.

>percent mix,

Just my 2 cents, but as someone who does this, I would try to see if you can add some type of quantitative framework around things. IE, unless you're just going to stay static at 40% short, I would have a measurable and repeatable process that can define when you should shift to 40% short vs. 20% short.

It doesn't need to be complex - it can be something as simple as using a moving average cross (not saying that's the best strategy). But adding this in can help keep you honest with yourself and from making any overt errors.

>risk and sector exposure (e.g. only having long/short pairs of stocks in same sector)

For long short pairs trading, I think you would really need to have a **very** strong understanding of fundamentals of all the companies in the industries you're looking at trading. This takes a lot of time and information, and even then, it can still go very wrong as pairs often reverse on factors not related to the fundamentals. If you're using leverage like most long-short strategies do, this can quickly become a very levered drawdown in a portfolio that you would have assumed to be market neutral.

In other words, be careful of the assumptions you're making on how things ""should"" trade, and be highly vigilant of crowded positioning if you can. This is how Melvin got themselves so stuck into GME before getting squeezed into oblivion.

>ways to structure to work in both bull and bear markets

If you have a good process for measuring whether you're in a bear or bull market, you would short defensive sectors during bear markets and go long cyclicals + growth. During bear markets, you simply invert that and go long defensives.

Problem here is that it requires you to have a very good process for doing market timing since you wouldn't want to be long cyclicals and short defensives during a big drawdown. Vice versa applies in bull markets.

**My 2 Cents**

Stocks don't trade based on their fundamentals. **They trade and get repriced on the** ***change*** **in their fundamentals or fundamental expectations.** Because of this, if you're looking to short anything, I would be very careful about simply shorting stuff that's over-valued, or simply shorting shitty companies.

I would try to get an understanding around how to evaluate changes in both fundamental as well as sentiment expectations since that's where the alpha is in my opinion. Those changes are usually affected more by broad shifts in the macro environment in my opinion, but also are affected by sentiment shifts, and fundamental items on a much smaller scale.",cbus20122,5,/r/investing/comments/n1mz3k/longshort_personal_portfolio_construction/gwf6o1x/,0.06,0.847,0.093,0.9692

It is not clear to me whether it is this announcement is contributing to the decrease of the share value or not.

I might not completely understand the implications of the statement ""establishing a joint venture in which Cosun Beet Company will take a substantial share"".

75,FOR," I am trying to understand why the value of a stock (Avantium, AVTX.AS) has been going down.

On April 14, the company offered new shares so the price went down due to share dilution. That price decrease I understand.

However, since April 22 the price has decreased more rapidly, and this coincides with the following announcement:

76,AMC," Im new and researching most days about investing and how to do it as a beginner.

Of course, we all want to be millionaires+, my question is, in order to get there, would one need many many shares in multiple sectors?

For instance, I have 4 shares in AMC. Nothing much but it's something. I see the market fluctuates, sometimes I'm making a profit, other times I've lost. The market is moving every day. So I wonder when someone has been investing for years and has a diverse portfolio and many shares, how're they doing really well? Is it cause they own so many shares and despite the market fluctuating, even if not in their favor, that they're able to be making hundreds of thousands of dollars?

I hope this makes sense",leetee91,1,/r/investing/comments/n1pwdw/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gwg7w8r/,0.041,0.808,0.151,0.9252

79,USA," My father just passed away and left approximately 45k to me and I'm looking for advice on how best to invest it.

Created a new account so I could comfortably ask Investing questions. 

&#x200B;

* How old are you? What country do you live in? 
   * 33, USA
* Are you employed/making income? How much? 
   * Employed, Income Approx 85k/yr

* What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs? 
   * No particular time horizon in mind.
* What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know its 100% safe?) 
   * I'd generally like to do something relatively safe with good growth potential with this inherited money. This is a substantial amount of money for me to add relative to my current portfolio.
* What are you current holdings? (Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors? Any other assets?) 
   * Currently max out my 401k up to employer match, in a target date fund. Current value maybe 100k ?
   * Max out my yearly Roth IRA contribution already with a 3-fund portfolio model (around 70k current value). 
   * Have about 20k in a personal investment account that's about 50% total market ETFs and 50%  individual stock picks
   * About 20k in savings (rainy day fund) and checking

86,GM, Their reliance on Fx50 trucks for so long has put them in a disadvantage. Only the truck & Mustang are the two things comes to mind when Ford is mentioned.

87,IMO," It doesn’t make sense IMO to pour more money into Rivian or be reliant on them for EV development. Those concerns may have been what prompted Ford to back out of the Rivian-based Lincoln EV that was in development.

It’s difficult to argue that a car manufacturer should not be 100% focused on electrification given the regulatory environment and Tesla’s performance so far.

Ford will bring out a Lincoln EV, but I would argue against the strategy of starting with that brand. I personally love Lincoln, but I don’t think the brand would pull in a huge number of EV buyers right now. Going with a semi-premium crossover and an EV pickup is going to help Ford achieve the scale it needs for batteries. 70% of Mach-E buyers are new-to-Ford customers. Build off that momentum, bring in new customers, and now you’ve got a path to upgrade them to a Lincoln EV later on.",MrMeiko,1,/r/investing/comments/n1zsic/ford_needs_to_rethink_their_strategy/gwgtibr/,0.051,0.855,0.094,0.8342
88,ICE," >Also Michigan is a right-to-work state and union membership has been declining because of this in recent years 

A valid point, I was looking chiefly at pure union membership rather than larger trends. That said, United Auto workers is still very powerful and has a significant influence on Ford's ability to cut vehicles from their lineup.

And by Midwest I was thinking of states like Ohio, Indiana, etc.

>electrifying their truck line is a no-brainer when they were humiliated by Tesla's Cybertruck in a towing demonstration.

In spite of the better utility in towing, Ford's pickups have better overall utility, consumer trust, identity, etc. and much of the target audience of pickups are big fans of ICE, the whole masculine vibe, and so forth.

While eventual electrification of pickups are important, I don't believe they should be the first avenue in.",CorneredSponge,-1,/r/investing/comments/n1zsic/ford_needs_to_rethink_their_strategy/gwghin5/,0.052,0.786,0.162,0.9312
