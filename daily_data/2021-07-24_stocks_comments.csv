3,JPM," I use weekend rests to look at how I want to grow my portfolio. I’ve stopped selling to reposition, so that means planning how I want to allocate dollars going into my taxable account (this is my hobby account). 

I use Fidelity to look at financials, technicals, ETF holdings and past performance, etc. I’m mostly an index fund guy, so I use those to look at rare single stock additions, especially attractive entry points, ETF holdings and efficacy of curation against various market conditions, etc. Some of these are narrow applications. For example, past performance is more generally useful for evaluating ETF curation than it is for general stock picking, and I use technicals mostly to look for especially good entry points by watching support levels. This has helped with things like selecting JPM based on financials, and getting in on Monday as JPM was slightly above support levels and coming off a strong earnings report.",BetweenCoffeeNSleep,1,/r/stocks/comments/oqngvr/does_anyone_else_feel_incredibly_bored_on/h6cunfw/,0.012,0.846,0.142,0.961

7,DD," I see this everywhere on Reddit, and I'ma speak frankly for a second.

If this is you, you are doing it wrong!

If you want something market related to do over the weekend you should be using this time to read up on any news on the stocks you own. You should be doing your DD and writing out your plans for each stock long term and for the week ahead. Use the quiet weekends to prepare for the chaos of the week. 

If that doesn't sound like the way you want to spend your weekends then do LITERALLY ANYTHING ELSE! Don't obsess over the markets while they are closed or you'll burn yourself out. Pick up a different hobby or hang out with family. Recharge the batteries for the week ahead.",TrainquilOasis1423,1,/r/stocks/comments/oqngvr/does_anyone_else_feel_incredibly_bored_on/h6dodan/,0.069,0.899,0.032,-0.7994
8,DIDI," It's the opposite for me.  Every market day I journal extensively.  Prices, events, news, thoughts, emotions, theories, analyst projections, ideas, you name it.  

Weekends are when all the past journal entries can be assimilated and considered without much time pressure or confusion.  

I'll make certain trading plans for the coming weeks and days.  Last weekend, for example, I made plans to sell a lot and raise a lot of cash on Monday, assuming prices cooperated.  The plan was to redeploy that cash into any dips, as I had a sense a correction was coming.  I ranked things as to what I expected to sell into strength first to last.  I knew which earnings were coming and journaled my own expectations for those, making plans of which I might hold regardless, and which I might want to sell on a rise into earnings.

Turns out I was off by a day.  The morning dip only accelerated. The correction had come early.  Even as you're losing value, it can be heartening to know your instincts aren't bad.  

Since I'd freshly assessed my whole portfolio, I could pivot right away.  The vix instrument I'd expected to sell later become top priority, so I sold that at pretty much peak to raise the cash I'd wanted.  And instead of waiting, I saw the momentum equity I wanted had crashed below my shopping list price, so I snagged that and it's already up over 15%.  Net-net, I'd added the name I wanted, and used vix money to do it instead of selling a solid equity.  I don't like riding vix instruments for too long, so this ended up being a better outcome.

I had some aggressive prices on the week's shopping list, so if the sell off continued, there were a number I wanted to buy.  A second day sell off would have done the trick, but instead the bounce came immediately.  No loss, The powder can just stay dry.  Maybe opportunities were missed, but there will be others.

From the weekend strategizing, I reaffirmed my long term goal to hold financials at least until the rate climate gets more normalized.  So then it's easy to fully blank out any concerns as I see them rock and roll along with treasury blips.  Having a plan helps isolate some things from being a distraction.

The weekend also helps to ponder China stocks, and to be ready for inevitable news that always drops Sunday evening.  Was the previous fear mongering overblown?  Or getting worse?  It felt like worse, so I made a plan to stop loss out of DIDI, which was fortuitous.

Next was to wait on the bets I'd made on TWTR and SNAP back when they were being sold down as overvalued.  The weekend plan was to watch and see if they rose too much before earnings.  They didn't, so I followed through on the plan to hold.  One of them suddenly approached my long term PT of $80, so I floated a bid to see if an easy $79 fish was out there.  It was, so I took some profit, which is a key discipline.  Might I miss a straight leg up? Quite possibly.  But I'll take a guaranteed large gain over a non-guaranteed extra large.  Worst case scenario I have capital to buy something else that's attractive.  Better than beating myself up if $79 retreats to $72. It didn't.  It finished $78, so maybe it has more to run.  That's ok.

Anyway, the point of the story is that weekends don't have to be the boring time, especially if you approach them with intent.  There's infinite numbers and situations to study.  It's like visualizing for goals.  Long ago I used to just have limited positions and big, year long macro views.  "" I hope oil goes up this year"" or ""maybe this is gold's year"".  You get trapped, and there's nothing you can actually do.  This method is better, suits today's market pace and information landscapes, and gives you some control.  It takes work and dedication, but what worthwhile thing doesn't?",Summebride,1,/r/stocks/comments/oqngvr/does_anyone_else_feel_incredibly_bored_on/h6eak1k/,0.095,0.801,0.104,0.6737

I had been wanting a long in to the sports gambling boom that is starting, and decided to pay the high price for one of the market leaders. Expensive, you bet, but I ultimately think these numbers will end up being very conservative for the digital gambling market when factoring in I & E gaming as well. The companies themselves already significantly undershot what 2021 would bring in YTD with some of the highest volume activities yet to come.

The other part where I think going short would be “short” sighted is to see them as a gambling pure
play, and I think the NFT announcement highlights they have no intent of that being the case. Now I’m not an NFT guy, but I think it reaffirms my thinking that they will branch out their revenue streams. 

Which brings me to the obvious step, similar to anywhere else that drives a high traffic digital space, that in time they will create an ad revenue stream that will likely end up as or more lucrative than the gambling business itself.

54,DK," Let me give an alternative calculation based purely on the U.K., where gambling has been legal or tolerated for centuries. Someone in another comment said it’s been legal since the 1970s, which is not correct. betting at race courses and events has been explicitly  legal for a much longer time and betting off courses has been explicitly legal since 1960. My calculation gives numbers about double Op’s. 

Gross gambling yield (total stakes received less pay outs, basically this means revenue) in the U.K. was £14.3 billion for the 2018-2019 period, the latest one fully reported. 

But this contains casinos and lotteries etc so isn’t the relevant number for draft kings. 

Gross gambling yield for remote betting - which I think is the right one - was £2.1 billion. This equates to $2.9 billion. 

The US population in total is 5x higher than the U.K., flexing U.K. revenue up by this factor makes $14.5 billion. 

US incomes are on average higher than those in the U.K., correcting for that makes $19.9 billion, call it $20 billion as a round number. 

Now if we look at Flutter (PDYPY, one of the UK’s largest bookmakers, who also have some international and other gambling revenue) they’re priced at 4.5x forward sales.

Taking all the together, assuming US sports market grew to a maturity position just like the one in the U.K. and assuming draft kings made up 100% of the US online sports betting market, ceteris paribus, you’d expect it to have total revenues of $20bn giving a market cap of $90bn if it had the same multiple as Flutter. Or in OP’s 50% market share assumption, $45 billion. 

Given that sports gambling isn’t legal in most of the US, and DK is still a small company which has to grow the market and keep / make a high market share, subject to huge execution risk, potential for competitive pressure, regulatory risk, and given the market won’t be mature for many years, I also have a hard time with its current $20bn market cap.

Now you might take issue with these assumptions, obviously draft kings isn’t just sports betting it’s fantasy teams etc etc. All I’ve done is try to picture the US sports betting market if it were exactly equivalent to the U.K., just bigger. I’m not trying to say that’s what it will end up like because it most certainly won’t. It may be way smaller because it may not be legal in many states, or it may end up way bigger for whatever reason (I’d probably back the latter).

60,DKNG," There's a great deal of flaws in your assumptions and numbers.  

But even if we set that aside and give you the undeserved benefit of the doubt, all this would mean is that DKNG isn't a value play.  

Not every stock has to be a value play.  It could just as well be a growth or momentum stock.  

As for potential, here in America, we've seen first hand and up close the staggering potential when a generation suddenly decided to adopt something.  That example is found in ""gambling"" via commission-free mobile apps.  The parallels to online gambling via Draftkings are obvious.  In just a year or two, kids doing stock market gambling has been explosive, we're talking tens of billions.  We're talking market and economy moving impacts.  If the same basic mechanic and emotion transfers to sports betting, with the added and nearly insane devotion impulsive people have to their teams and players, maybe that same kind of earthquake is possible.  Maybe.

A lot of your case seems to assume DKNG is just one of hundreds of unknown juice makers, but here in America, Draftkings is something like Coca Cola.  It's by far the best known of a duopoly industry.  It's everywhere.  Everyone knows it.  It's growing.  It's not leaving.  

If you watch, it's executing constantly, inking deals, getting known, opening markets state by state, developing partnerships sport by sport.  

If you were here, you'd see that dominance.  Imagine if all your bookies and betting companies were vaporized overnight, and just 2 were left alive.  The only question then is what price should that number one status in a duopoly command?  Maybe lower, maybe higher.  But at least that's a more forthright description of the climate.

They're on the eve of a new and potentially more ""normal"" NFL season, which is their half year long Christmas.

You literally conjured some imaginary frat bros and made up imaginary numbers.  You erroneously assumed they're poor, but here in America, they'd be privileged, not poor.

So I pictured my own frat bro characters, with privilege and lack of impulse control, who watch all 4 major days of football (not the soccer kind) and who do what such guys do.

89,TSLA," Honestly solar may or may not be the future.  Wind is likely better, though in certain parts of the world solar is competitive.  What TSLA valuation is largely based on ATM is the self driving software.  I would call them the market leader in self driving tech, and also the leader in EV design.  They probably make the best cars of today, no joke or exaggeration.  Soon there will come a time when self driving becomes safer than humans.  Not exactly sure when.  Could be another 2 years, could be 5, could be 10.  But eventually you'll literally feel safer knowing your kids have a Tesla that drives them around than giving your 16 year old the keys and hoping he's safe and responsible and don't drive intoxicated.  The value is there.  Its just a matter of the timeframe and if they can keep their lead or lose it to perhaps Brian Selesky's company or Rivian.  Perhaps their stiffest competition and its such a weird thing to pursue.  It's just lines of code that can interpret what cameras see.  You need object orientation, detection, identification.

93,ATH," Honestly, I think it’s pretty simple: people don’t like to post their losses as much as they like to post gains (except maybe at wallstreetbets). Plus, a bunch of 2% gains or losses isn’t really worth posting. A single 400% gain could be though.

Also, it’s mathematically not possible for everybody to outperform the market by such a large margin. For a guy who bought a stock at a five-year low and sold it at the ATH, there’s someone out there who sold it to him at the five-year low for a loss, and a (hopefully different) person who bought it at the ATH.

97,LOW," Depends, how much profit is the goal? 100%? 200%? 10%? The more risk, the more you can make and the more you can lose.

1. If you don't want to lose any money or take risk, a treasury/bond get 1-2% (1 dollar).
2. An index fund, like others recommend (boggleheads) VOO, VTI, etc make 5-10% (4-8 dollars). Moderate risk.
3. Buying fractional shares of a single stock is much higher risk, with risk = reward. Buying apple will probably make 5-20% per year (4-16 dollars), while buying the more volatile PLTR might make -30% to 50% (lose 14 dollars up to gaining 40 dollars).
4. I am in on NLST, which is pretty much a penny stock. Penny stocks are super risky, and can go from -99% in minutes, up to +300% in minutes. Some of the best pennies I have seen include NLST (should go 2-3x by end of year- now 8 usd to maybe 20 USD is reasonable, with upper limit of 40-50 USD per share, which means 80 USD would become 200, maximum 400) and SPRT (5 USD now, looks like its shooting up soon). SPRT looks very volatile and could be a short term event (have to sell in a matter of minutes or hours otherwise it could drop from 300% increase back down to -50%). Theres good forums where you can find more information on the OTC and the penny stocks.
5. The most important thing I have learned is, it is way more important to really look at the chart for a stock, index, etc. and buy AT A LOW PRICE, than it is to pick the right stock. If you buy only when the stock is down, you can make money on any stock.

102,IMO," IMO you should start investing with a mutual fund or ETF that gives you broad exposure to the entire market. something like VOO, IWB, ITOT/VTI. these will give you hundreds or thousands of stocks from different industries, which minimizes your risk if a few of the companies blow up. 

for single stocks, I recommend you check out Peter Lynch's books; the Little Book that Beats the Market by Joel Greenblatt; and the Little Book of Value Investing by Christopher Browne. all these authors are 'value investors'. the stock price may or may not reflect the fair value of the company, so value investing looks for stocks that are on-sale or underpriced. like finding a used car in good condition that sells for $8000 when Kelly Blue Book says it's worth $11,000. long-term, value investing tends to give you the best bang for your buck.
