It's cheap but I wouldn't rank it in the same risk category as penny stocks - the company is much more solid behind the ticker and has a great history as a company. It's still only about 5% of my portfolio, though that's bound to change - $PLUG used to be the same. I balanced that one out after the CEO exercised his options, but still held a third of my position. I netted about a 600% profit, just like the CEO. I'm not a millionaire now, though. üòï

Most of these contracts won't reflect on the earnings report coming out. They increased the value of their stock by about 1% in Q4 -- not bad in a global pandemic, but not great either. The papers were signed in January, so the real catalysts will be the Q1 earnings report. Now is a good time to buy and hold. I suspect there'll be a bump in the price after Q1 earnings are released, then a steady climb\* for the next 4 years while the 5G projects make progress.

¬∑ Securitization brands have been the main reason for terrible results. DTR licenses - retailers ended those deals/didn‚Äôt renew when they expired

¬∑ Non-securitization brands are the iconic brands. Non-revenue producing trademarks of Umbro China and Lee Cooper China monetized in 2020/2021 for a significant sum of money - $78.5m

¬∑ Umbro alone is worth the EV today. Iconix bought Umbro from Nike for $225m. Since then, they have continued to build the brand - won England rugby in May 2020. Also represent several of the top soccer teams around the globe - such as West Ham, Burnley, FC Schalke. The company does not break out financials by brand, but it is estimated that Umbro does far north of $10m of EBITDA

¬∑ As the company owns the trademarks + outsources all manufacturing/selling, the company has incredibly high margins + strong cash flow characteristics (55% EBITDA margins in 2019). The company produced $75m of EBITDA and $65m of free cash flow in 2018, and $82m of EBITDA and $53m of free cash flow in 2019. The company generated cash in 2020 during the pandemic and is expected to generate cash again in '21.

**At $225 valuation (the price Iconix paid for Umbro), the stock would be $7.60**

This stock traded at 17$ before covid smashed q2 earnings in 2020. Currently trading under $4 it is in position for a short squeeze back into the $8-10 range with earnings in place to help find new higher levels of support along the way.

Here‚Äôs the information:

The last month IVR is up over 20%, last week IVR was up more than 6% after peaking at 4.50 mid week. they have earnings the third week of February.

Short % is 22, institutional ownership is 55% and Feb.19 Short interest is all between 4-4.5 SP

With increased earnings run up, possibility of recovery (even though this stayed green last week) and its new found support around $4 - 8% dividend as well.

This provides both short term squeeze opportunities and long term dividend opportunity. It‚Äôs possible that we see price activity comparable to last June. This would mean $8-$9 a share. By the end of February if we can break 4.5 and hold that. But it seems to have a large MM wall at 4.50.

268,USA," Honestly - take a look at LUFF Brands. $LUFF. I think this will 2-3x easily. Maybe 5-6.

So I bought about $5700 of this stock, with my average price of around 0.022, and the more I look at it the better it seems. Of course, do your own research but from what I'm reading online, and looking at their latest financials, I honestly think this is a 10 or even a 15c stock.

So this company used to be Ascent back in 2018, which was a cannabis company in Canada. They were worth ab out $300M at the time, but then had ""issues"" with Health Canada

[https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/ascent-pot-creditor-protection-1.5042155](https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/ascent-pot-creditor-protection-1.5042155)

So Health Canada cuts their license, shareholders are pissed and put it into CCAA. As part of that, they sell off all their Canadian assets and restructure the company in the USA. They have some major facilities in Vegas and Portland, and are going after the USA CBD market.

So when I look at the industry, there was a huge run in 2018/early 2019, then the cannabis market crashed in Canada. All the companies in the industry went down like 50-80% from their peak. Over the past couple years, the reason everyone says there was issues was because of over supply in the market. What it looks like is that the Canada weed market is a bad market, for a lot of different reasons.

Anyway, why I'm saying this is that these guys actually gave up/forced out of Canada into the USA, but that was actually a saving grace for them. USA market is where you would want to be, and they aren't bloated with massive greenhouses in Canada anymore.

In the past 4-5 months, a lot of the main players (Canopy, Aurora etc) have actually come back. Their stocks are not at highs, but they're getting very high again because of the USA market opportunity with Biden. None of that has been priced into LUFF at all yet. Plus they haven't even released any financials so nobody knows about these guys yet.

Here's what I'm seeing:

They launched their shop site. I signed up and got an email with a discount code, so they're already selling products (although haven't declared sales yet).

[https://webfiles.thecse.com/sedar\_filings/00045751/2101141236347390.pdf](https://webfiles.thecse.com/sedar_filings/00045751/2101141236347390.pdf)

They produce internally, so their margins are going to be good and capacity looks very strong:

[https://webfiles.thecse.com/sedar\_filings/00045751/2009291448307976.pdf](https://webfiles.thecse.com/sedar_filings/00045751/2009291448307976.pdf)

Here is the big one. Look at page 16 of their financial report:

[https://webfiles.thecse.com/sedar\_filings/00045751/2011231320244131.pdf](https://webfiles.thecse.com/sedar_filings/00045751/2011231320244131.pdf)

They have 88 MILLION warrants at an exercise price of 0.05 expiring on June 24. My bet is that this gets for sure to 0.05, and then there's a surge of new investors in this thing looking to build and run it up. Normally I'd be concerned about dilution, but there's already so many shares out its not really an issue for me. 

Then I look at the latest SEDI filings, and it seems all their insiders got shares at 0.015c and 2c, and options starting at 0.05c. This again tells me that everyone is incentivized to make this thing go at least above 8-10, likely 10-15c.

I put out a couple more bids at 0.02 and 0.025c. There's a few people on other forums saying similar things, but I think this is undervalued versus the industry, and think you should take a look.

Also represent several of the top soccer teams around the globe - such as West Ham, Burnley, FC Schalke.

CETY essentially turns wasted heat into renewable electricity and now gets tax credits for corporations under the Biden Administration. They create this renewable electricity at the source where it is being used. Not out in the desert which requires infrastructure to transport that electricity to Cities. 

CETY technology was originally developed by General Electric and sold off to avoid bankruptcy protection and to bet on oil. Well GE was wrong and it will be proven soon enough. 

CETY has waste heat recovery systems in several countries throughout Europe. They have partnerships in Russia and a presence in China..and CETY is based in Southern California with a legit website. 

CETY has short term catalysts coming our way and is poised for exponential growth. Waste heat recover market is in the Billions and expected to continue growing exponentially.

* Non-securitization brands are the iconic brands. Non-revenue producing trademarks of Umbro China and Lee Cooper China monetized in 2020/2021 for a significant sum of money - $78.5m
* Umbro alone is worth the EV today. Iconix bought Umbro from Nike for $225m. Since then, they have continued to build the brand - won England rugby in May 2020.

* As the company owns the trademarks + outsources all manufacturing/selling, the company has incredibly high margins + strong cash flow characteristics (55% EBITDA margins in 2019). The company produced $75m of EBITDA and $65m of free cash flow in 2018, and $82m of EBITDA and $53m of free cash flow in 2019. The company generated cash in 2020 during the pandemic and is expected to generate cash again in '21.

Start small, keep green and dont panic. Do you research. Only invest what you can afford to lose. Do not over chase. Do not close too early (or too late). Do not get emotional (mental health is a tricky one as the ups and downs can be hard on you).

Case studies are in hindsight and should normally involve significant DD and comprehension (and I am sure there are 20 negative tales from each positive one)

That really depends on how you trade, how much you trade, how serious you are and how dedicated you are (or just get lucky :)

¬∑ Securitization brands have been the main reason for terrible results. DTR licenses - retailers ended those deals/didn‚Äôt renew when they expired

¬∑ Non-securitization brands are the iconic brands. Non-revenue producing trademarks of Umbro China and Lee Cooper China monetized in 2020/2021 for a significant sum of money - $78.5m

¬∑ Umbro alone is worth the EV today. Iconix bought Umbro from Nike for $225m. Since then, they have continued to build the brand - won England rugby in May 2020. Also represent several of the top soccer teams around the globe - such as West Ham, Burnley, FC Schalke. The company does not break out financials by brand, but it is estimated that Umbro does far north of $10m of EBITDA

¬∑ As the company owns the trademarks + outsources all manufacturing/selling, the company has incredibly high margins + strong cash flow characteristics (55% EBITDA margins in 2019). The company produced $75m of EBITDA and $65m of free cash flow in 2018, and $82m of EBITDA and $53m of free cash flow in 2019. The company generated cash in 2020 during the pandemic and is expected to generate cash again in '21.

**At $225 valuation (the price Iconix paid for Umbro), the stock would be $7.60**

ICNAF as they are US based and focus on pre-roll with industry leading tech on the rolling process.

MCOA is US based and focused on CBD‚Äôs, and investment opportunities within the cannabis sector. New board members and more active in the growth of the business, especially expanding into central and South America. They recently stock swapped with Cannabis Global, CBGL, as these guys focus on secured cannabis transportation business, Comply.

MJ is a good one for diversification.  Basically a mutual fund for marijuana stocks.

HEMP is related to the craze.  More focused on hemp and CBD products.  Ultra cheap (pink sheet stock), but they don't have a crazy number of shares like a lot of other pink sheets.

¬∑ Securitization brands have been the main reason for terrible results. DTR licenses - retailers ended those deals/didn‚Äôt renew when they expired

¬∑ Non-securitization brands are the iconic brands. Non-revenue producing trademarks of Umbro China and Lee Cooper China monetized in 2020/2021 for a significant sum of money - $78.5m

¬∑ Umbro alone is worth the EV today. Iconix bought Umbro from Nike for $225m. Since then, they have continued to build the brand - won England rugby in May 2020. Also represent several of the top soccer teams around the globe - such as West Ham, Burnley, FC Schalke. The company does not break out financials by brand, but it is estimated that Umbro does far north of $10m of EBITDA

¬∑ As the company owns the trademarks + outsources all manufacturing/selling, the company has incredibly high margins + strong cash flow characteristics (55% EBITDA margins in 2019). The company produced $75m of EBITDA and $65m of free cash flow in 2018, and $82m of EBITDA and $53m of free cash flow in 2019. The company generated cash in 2020 during the pandemic and is expected to generate cash again in '21.

**At $225 valuation (the price Iconix paid for Umbro), the stock would be $7.60**

The rise of streaming content was something putting theaters at risk, but simply a reminder that theaters are still around might be enough to get people going again. You will always have some level of distractions at home that makes it harder to completely immerse yourself in a film. Watching a movie and *going* to a movie will always be separate experiences for me. I mean, if you like concerts, plays, or musicals, is it really ""good enough"" when watching one at home on your TV? It might feel that way until you actually go see one live again.

I say this as someone who used to go all the time, but fell off the bus for a couple years because there were enough options at home. I started going again a lot right before the pandemic (unfortunately) and can attest that there is just no comparing experiences. If AMC has a way to get someone in the theater again when Covid starts becoming less of a risk, I think it will be very easy to get interest going again, especially if they still have their movie pass for more expensive markets like NYC. Most people still like going to the movies, I think they just actually forgot how much they do and need a little reminder.",kingethjames,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/la7dtl/what_are_the_realities_of_amc/glneqc8/,0.04,0.857,0.104,0.954

Everywhere that the states don't have a lockdown that prevents it, which is most of the country except Cali and NY.

I'm a huge germaphobe and I feel completely safe watching a movie.

The fundamentals are awful and the cash infusion is going to general corporate expenses, which I'm sure are important internally, but I doubt will make a difference in their upcoming earnings report. Their operating lost from March 2019 to Sept. 2020 increased by 85 percent. Their Q3 revenue missed by $7 million and they could get de-listed on NASDAQ if they don't consistently stay over $1. There's a reason this is over-shorted.

663,CRBP," Since these are swings I'll just look at the charts and see how they look.  Presenting here for feedback and to share.

SNGX - looks like it could recover from here but doesn't give me a clear signal.  I'd be hesitant to jump in without some good fundamental reason.  Why did this dump so hard end of 2020?  A bunch vested shares get unlocked or something?  Bad company news?

&#x200B;

CRBP - Good eye here.  This looks like a good entry and that it wants to at least retest $2.20's.  If it breaks through there it has lots of room to run before hitting any resistance shown on the chart.

&#x200B;

CCIHY - no signal on my chart for me.  Not saying you're wrong, just that I don't see anything compelling.  I miss stuff all the time though.  Curious to know what you see.

&#x200B;

EPAZ - Chart looks good for an entry here with a tight stop.  Good r/R for a trade imo.  Don't see the clear signal to the upside but it's on support and might want to push higher.  The ability to put a tight stop on it makes it attractive. 

&#x200B;

PASO - Well, I guess this could be the bottom.  It's getting beaten down pretty hard and last drive down was very high volume but didn't sink price too much.  That can be a good sign.  It's not the kind of set up I look for though.  Power to those that are good at these kinds of set ups - I'm not (please teach me.)

773,SENS,"   

I am a father of a T1D son.  We‚Äôve dealt with Diabetes for the past 13 years.  it sucks, It‚Äôs expensive and is always in your face.  Diabetes is always there - you can‚Äôt just walk away from it.  Since 2007 we‚Äôve had two different types of insulin pumps with each companies pathetic Continues Glucose Monitoring (CGM).  They are expensive, only last up to 3 - 5 days and rarely last that long on the body for various reasons.  If by chance the CGM does go the distance to 5 or so days, many times there are connectivity issues, causing you to start all over again with a new $45 external sensor.  If the CGM is on the outside of the body, it will fail more times then not.  

In 2017 we were introduced to the Eversense CGM system.  It has worked 100% of the time with no issues.  Its accuracy is exceptional with calibration intervals increasing. Since 2018 Calibration has gone from 2x a day to 2x a week.  That will change.  Folks, this product has changed my son‚Äôs life for the better.  No more finger pokes, CGM variables programmed on the phone with on body vibration to a criteria the patient sets.  Most importantly , it accurately shows trends.  There is a big difference between a meter reading of 100 and falling fast vs 100 and slowly increasing.  This product answers that question every time you look at your phone.  I‚Äôve talked about the upside of Eversense, let‚Äôs talk about the down side.

There is a shortage of providers.  We live in NE Kansas and had to drive into Kansas City every 90 days for a new sensor.  My son went off to college, and now has to drive 50 miles to the closest provider.  The cost to insert the sensor, remove and replace the sensor is expensive. For those of us with high deductible  insurance plans, you need to budget for about $350+ for the removal and replacement appointment.  As for the sensor itself, it is covered at 100% so there is no cost there regardless of deductible.  

I‚Äôve been buying shares of SENS since 2018, lost money at first but continued to buy when priced at or around $0.40.  I will continue to purchase this stock as I believe it is the Keystone to a closed loop CGM system (AKA Artificial Pancreas).

804,UK," Agree. 

I believe there was some dilution, so it's is unlikely to reach previous highs. That being said, it was likely a smart move to have money on hand to get them through the pandemic. They have also laid off many workers. 

Not only do they make engines for planes that aren't running, but they make them for the biggest planes that are likely going to be the last ones back in the air. I believe Airbus cancelled a bunch of plane builds recently. So yes, long hold. 

England is in a bad way with the pandemic as well as economic uncertainty from brexit, things are going to be down over there in general. 

The good news is, RR is very important to the UK government, both for air travel and the military, they will likely be protected. The UK has been through hard times before, I'm sure they will come out strong eventually. Other good news would be that RR has been acquiring patents through this, likely expanding their capabilities and diversifying. I believe one of the patents was for mini nuklear reactors iirc, which I found interesting. 

I think it's a good investment long term, and I've been throwing extra money into it here and there, thinking it should eventually recover to at least $3. It's actually become my largest investment, as it feels like a safe bet, albeit long. I have it in the back of my mind that maybe it has potential to break out into other fields in the future, old company with a lot of government support looking to rebuild itself might have an advantage if it gets into new tech, this is speculation though.

814,TD," I am not sure. Currently, TD Ameritrade hasn't listed HCMC on their restrrictions page, but from what I know, is that when the price of a security rises too quickly or too much, a circuit breaker goes into effect, similar to what happened way back in March with the broad index. The halt should be for just a few minutes, and unlike for the whole market, a trading halt can occur when a stock increases too quickly, in addition to an excessive decline in price. The halt should be temporary, so if you still receive an error I am not so sure why that is.

Good Day folks,

Here‚Äôs one that deserves some research (I‚Äôve done mine and I‚Äôm in for just over 10,000 shares).

The ticker symbol is: (HYSR) Sunhydrogen Inc.

I saw an article on the Toyota Mirai (a hydrogen fueled car) now available in California & Hawaii. Coming to towns near you!!!

Here‚Äôs the SunHydrogen (HYSR) technology in plain english (or at least as I understand it)

1. This company has developed a somewhat solar panel like device that can make (green) hydrogen from water and sunlight (photosynthesis).

2. Hydrogen fuel can then be made at the point of distribution (gas stations, home residence)

3. The ability to create fuel at the point of distribution will alleviate the transport of volatile fuels over our highways and byways and railways and some pipeline networks.

4. The exhaust of hydrogen fueled cars and other vehicles‚Ä¶WAIT FOR IT‚Ä¶WATER!!!!

5. Go back to step 1. LOL!!!!",ThaiDula,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/la9qf3/so_whats_everyone_thinking_about_hysr/gln62n1/,0.014,0.916,0.07,0.8178
