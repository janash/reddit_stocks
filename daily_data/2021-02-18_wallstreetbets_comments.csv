1,ATH," I just want to say, to everyone in here who bought GME at or below 400 or even at the ATH, just remember that during that run up you were 100% correct in your thinking that the stock was going to continue to go up. 

After it crashed, I fought with myself for days thinking, ""what the hell is wrong with me, why wouldn't I sell when it was 480, why am I so greedy?"" 

But it wasn't greed, not entirely. It was calculated. We did the research, we had the DD, we knew the numbers and all the evidence told us that the squeeze hadn't squoze at 480 and it was about to absolutely fucking launch into andromeda. AND. WE. WERE. RIGHT. 

Then they turned the game off.

So if you ever feel down on yourself in this situation, try to find some comfort in the fact that we were indeed making the right play. This guy admits it himself.

4,GME," Holy fucking shit. I’m mildly retarded and thought I understood what was going on but I just realized I didn’t have a fucking clue. Now I actually understand what was going on and I’m goddamn furious. These hedge fund bitches knowingly put themselves in a crazy risky position to the point where if they lost they would quite literally lose everything....people realized that was the case and bought GME knowing that is what was going to happen...they made an actually not retarded decision when we were all playing by fair rules. Then little green bitching hood comes in and purposefully saves her grandma hedgie friends by undermining the whole rationale that many bought in the first place. The game was over and they had lost so they just flipped the whole table over. Now they have the fucking audacity to sit there rubbing their bitch tits and asking us why we did that. I swear to god this is why people murder. This is the most bullshit I’ve ever seen in my life and I’m not even joking my dad is an actual cattle rancher.

We have this guy, on air, outright stating that they would have had to deliver 270M shares. There are only 50M in existence to be traded. They would have had to buy **every share in existence** then do it again 4.2 more times. Every single time they purchased all of the shares to return to their rightful owners, they'd have to by their own rules, go back into the market and beg these same people they just returned shares to, to sell them back so they could return them to someone else. 

And they'd have lost everything to do it, and when they had nothing left, the Citadels would be on the hook, and then the big banks. And none of them were getting out of it because these were their own damn rules. They would have had to mass liquidate their other holdings absolutely tanking the rest of the market in order to fulfil their obligations on GME.

result, the gaming industry had its best year ever. But GameStop had significant losses.

261,GME," It feels like Thanos have snapped his fingers.

But I'm holding.

Even through all the pain, I'm holding.

Most of us know the hard truth the billionaires have always been running the world..

Even after 2008, they remain as arrogant than ever.

But the manner they have done it this time.

They have crossed it.

Blatant.

Utter contempt.

In our faces.

I can't walk away not giving my all.

I can't live with myself.

I'm angry. 

I'm pissed.

But I'm never giving up.

You can take away every last dollar I have in GME.

But you're not going to take away my fight.

You can laugh all you want.

You can mock all you want.

You can bot all you want.

But this isn't a joke to me.

This last effort will stay. 

It will never go away.

It will irritate you.

It will test you.

It will break you.

Wanna break me? 

Don't bother. I'm already broken. 

I've got nothing left except my fight.

And that's what I'm keeping with me for the rest of my life.

Even after 2008, they remain as arrogant than ever.

But the manner they have done it this time.

They have crossed it.

Blatant.

Utter contempt.

In our faces.

I can't walk away not giving my all.

I can't live with myself.

I'm angry. 

I'm pissed.

But I'm never giving up.

You can take away every last dollar I have in GME.

But you're not going to take away my fight.

You can laugh all you want.

You can mock all you want.

You can bot all you want.

But this isn't a joke to me.

This last effort will stay. 

It will never go away.

It will irritate you.

It will test you.

It will break you.

Wanna break me? 

Don't bother. I'm already broken.

 https://youtube.com/watch?v=_TPYuIRVfew&feature=share

Where the guy basically says the price could have actually hit a couple thousand makes me realize i shouldn't have been sad and hard on myself and that i actually wasn't fucking wrong. It makes me so fucking livid.

These past two weeks i thought I had missed out a potential 30k from when the stock price was $450 and have been kicking myself. I now fucking know that i was potentially FUCKING ROBBED out of maybe $100k. Any thought/doubt about selling or getting out is fucking out of my head. I am fucking holding. Food stamps or lambos from here on out.

He’s practically saying he was actively betting against the stock as the flaws were exposed,  and lost that bet. 

More importantly....  his timing is when it was the main stream media actually talking about how “these Reddit people made gamestock jump from $20 to $40 in a day”,   Which did a lot more than drive the general public into the stock than DFV ever did.

**SUBJECT**
GME - How to Address the Root - 2 Witnesses and Questions

**BODY**

I am highly interested in the hearing regarding GameStop by the Financial Services committee.

The witnesses today are a great start, however they only scratch the surface. They do not represent those at the root of the issue. In short, the DTCC and the Market Makers that are currently actively engaged in this ONGOING event with GME need to be questioned. PFOF is something that should be addressed, but it should not be the focus of these hearings. My opinion is that the focus should be the manipulation of the stock that has occured and is currently ONGOING.

Someone needs to ask DTCC what would have happened to the stock price had deposit requirements not been raised, and what the implications of that would be for the DTCC. (The answer is the price likely would have continued to rise and DTCC would have eventually been liable.)

Someone needs to ask Virtu Financial why they are engaging in dark pool trading far beyond what is typical for other stocks and how many disciplinary actions they've received related to cross trading and mismanaged shorting + failures to deliver (The answer is a bunch).

Furthermore, numerous egregious conflicts of interest exist with these firms which directly impact the ongoing $GME event. Information below. I can provide citations for all of this, just reply with a request for full citations.

----

Virtu Financial is the largest processor of off exchange trades (darkpool / cross trading) for GameStop. Off exchange trades for GME are an extreme outlier. Robinhood feeds customer data to the Market Maker Virtu Financial. Virtu financial specializes in providing ""deep liquidity"". Virtu Financial acquired KCG and is the parent company of ITG Canada, all of these firms have a history of market violations. Those violations include incorrectly processing short trades for clients resulting in the trades appearing to be long trades and subsequent failures to deliver. GameStop is an extreme outlier in Failure to Deliver Rate. Failures to deliver are a known sign of market manipulation by the SEC. Virtu acquired KCG, which sold their market making capability to Citadel. Citadel and KCG were part of an investigation for harming retail investors. Citadel was one of the firms to bail out Melvin Capital, which was one of the primary firms shorting GameStop.

Now I believe it's close to what it should be worth (so not undervalued anymore), but it's still a growth stock that could turn into a lot more in the future.

669,GME," I know the feeling man, I used to invest in stocks like 10 years ago but after putting in ""so much work/time"" (I know its relative, it was probably not enough) I got out with lessons learned and managed to average wins/losses as to get back my starting capital.  
I decided only to invest in ""stable"" and ""trustable"" things after that. So mostly fixed income stuffs (from small investment banks) and recently (3yrs ago) bonds/federal debs which have higher returns (2% month, here in Brazil).  
I've also invested around 10% in a certain coin which can't be mentioned here and it made me absurd profits, I trust it way more than stocks and everything else since the system is distributed and transparent.  


But my point is, after 10 years of vowing not to touch stocks I heard about the GME thing and went in (with money I didn't expect to see ever again).   
At 45, 50, and 300. And then they robbed us, imagine my frustation as well. Not 'cause TODAY I'm at a loss, but 'cause there's 0 transparency and it just proved the whole world runs on BS (which is something I already know, working for multinationals all my life).

And worse than that, they'll probably just a get a slap on wrist.

Still, all the people mad with how the world is moving will eventually grow large enough as to make a difference (eventually).

So I'll sell 250 credit spreads and then 50 and not get as much as I would have originally because the underlying has been collapsing. 

Then I go to close my 300 positions. Now, it's under 0.24 so I can only do 200 options (100 spreads) at a time. I should be able to quick close my entire position.

863,ARE," Shorting a stock is how bears make money, but to move this to an Options discussion, ""Put"" options are how bears make money.  A put is the opposite of a call.  A Put contract is basically an agreement that I, as the buyer, can sell you, as the seller, 100 shares of a stock at a given price (aka the Strike Price).  I can do this at anytime during the duration of the contract.  So if the price the stock is trading at plummets, I could exercise my put: meaning I would buy the shares cheap for their current value and then sell them to the person I bought the put option from at that original strike price.

Additional Note to those new to options: when buying options (calls and puts) you really aren't going to exercise the actual option ever.  It's very rare to do this, and it requires  unique circumstances to make it worth doing.  What you ARE going to be doing, is selling off these options when they become valuable, and it accomplishes the same thing.

You are living in a fantasy land and it's hilarious you think you have the slightest purchase on reality. Bernie is a decent dude and I supported him in '16, but the numbers don't lie she can't be a spoiler if half her support at that time were Biden leaning voters - the more leftist clump had already mostly gone to Bernie.

It's a non argument. Just a dumb excuse for why saint Bernie lost because no one was looking at the actual numbers in their reddit and twitter bubbles.

think about banks.  the reason banks are FDIC insured is to prevent collapse.  if RH had no credit then everyone on RH wouldn't have been able to do anything (buy, sell, withdrawal) until another brokerage came in to take over (another regulation in place to prevent collapse).

1036,NOK," I work in telecoms. I used to buy a lot of network equipment. Now I advise companies all over the world who buy network equipment.

Before 2008 Chinese vendors were basically not taken seriously at all around the world. Then they started winning contracts. A lot of contracts. They were making better shit than Nokia, Siemens, Ericsson, ALU et al and for way less money. They went from zero market share to about 40% of orders in radio, transport and core within 5 years. It kept going up after that but not as fast. We bought some radio from NOK in my country in 2014 but they were so desperate it was comical. 

One effect it had was driving a lot of consolidation and incredible retrenchment from other businesses, eg NOK handsets.

What you have to realize is the impact of this 'flight from China' you see all over North America, AUS/ NZ, and Europe. A lot of it was driven by the Trump administration but it has its own momentum now. Security forces sort of signed onto this agreeing it's a security risk. What this means is that Hua and ZTE are getting shut out of the 5G contracts and all the radio/ TX/ core upgrades happening. What that means is that the ""last men standing"" from the big 2008 - 2013 shakeout (NOK, Ericsson, ALU) stand to gain an incredible amount of share just by virtue of Hua/ ZTE being effectively banned. They will also gain a vast amount of pricing power without these competitors. 

I estimate the average mobile operator is going to have to increase network CAPEX by about 30 - 40% for 5G. A lot of this will be fiber optics, but a lot will be radio and core equipment.

1120,BB," Good news is just speculation. We need hard numbers and a direct path to revenue growth. We have no idea how much potential revenue any of these updates will translate into. $5m or $500m? When numbers are released and pricing structures/market penetration can be seen we will see movement. Short interest is currently 3% of float. very low for a highly volatile stock that doubled its market cap in a month.

I'm long on BB. I like the stock. I need to stop buying calls and just hold my shares lmao

edit: Market sees it as a cash cow that is currently burning cash. Its a slow burn but a burn nonetheless. Cash cow burning cash = bad. The consolidation around $11-13 from $6 includes the current speculation and good news. Most of this good news wont translate to actual revenue until 2023. We don't know the size of the market in 2023. We don't know how highly these systems will be valued then.

1147,CEO," Institutions break laws all the time. They are fine paying the fines. It’s what keeps this going. 

An article that came out recently is calls for more regulations over  clearings houses and blaming them for the restrictions but in trades recently. THIS IS FALSE. Please read and share. 

This is our one chance to force congress to fix the rigged markets...

The agencies that regulate the markets:

Brokers - the SEC
Market makers - the NASB
Cleaning houses - doesn’t matter 
Hedge Funds - FINRA

What I learned from Google. 

A Market makers role in the markets has changed over the years. But their main purpose is to provide liquify to the market. So they are there to buy what wants to be sold and sell what wants to be bought. They set the bit and ask prices and control the spread between them. This is how they make money and is justified by the amount of risk they take on. Therefore, they have ZERO fiduciary responsibility and not required to operate with the investor’s best interest (like brokers are). So they can definitely  manipulate the price of a stock.

Two other things MM do blew my fucking mind and set sirens and alarms off in head. This was the first... what the fucking fuck moment. MM also provide *some* liquify to the options market. And they are allowed to manage their inventory. I honestly don’t know which one is worse. If this isn’t perfect storm situation to guarantee fraud, I don’t know what is. I almost forgot and this part. They are allowed to buy and sell from their own inventory to make a profit also. Lol Smfh so they can easily tank a stocks price or make people think there is more activity than there really is. Probably no manipulation here though.. more likely to find people manipulating markets on Reddit. 

Clearing houses take on no risks. They will only accept trades that offset due to the time it takes settle. This would support the argument that market makers do have a purpose in our markets. They take on the risk to provide liquidity... and why they are allowed to make money from the spread in the buy and the ask price. 

When I googled hedge funds, I had another what the fucking fuck moment. Hedge funds invest in riskier investments (shorting stocks and derivatives). What blew my mind is they have no reporting obligation to anyone on how they make money. It could be a madoff Ponzi scheme and no disclosure. 

Remember vladfag making multiple comments when he wasn’t even asked saying no relationship between citadel and robinhood? Of course one doesn’t own the other. That would be illegal. They def had relationship.. maybe it’s not the hedge fund citadel, but the market maker citadel is routed a majority of robinhood’s trade. I heard him mention multiple times and was never asked once so it seemed sketch. 

So meeting with congress tomorrow:

-DFV
-Reddit CEO
-Robinhood douche 
-Citadel HF 
-Melvin Capital HF

Who’s not required to go talk to congress to answer questions:

-Market makers
-Cleaning houses 

1)  unless it’s to defend DFV, wtf information is Reddit ceo going to provide to congress to help them understand what happened in markets?!
2) if clearing houses are to blame or and need more regulations, why the fuck are they attending or asked to explain any details? Bc vlad explained it so clearly? 
3) DID EVERYONE FORGET ABOUT THE MARKET MAKER?!?!? 

If MM take on the risk and are there to sell what wants to be sold and buy what wants to be purchase, where the fuck were they for GameStop? Yes a clearing house has a reserve requirement... but robinhood also restricted instant deposit limits that week and max instant deposit you could use to trade was $1000. So the restrictions were should have nothing to do with trading activity, bc MM take on the risk. You can’t have margin on a $1k account. I know this bc I had two diff clients mention it. They weren’t trying to get in on the action after trades were restricted.

It doesn’t make sense reserve reserve req being raised. That’s what MM are for. So they can just abandon their position in making markets operate smoothly and no recourse? They don’t even take the blame for any of it?!?! And no one mentions them once?!??? Seems like they are trying to protect or shield the MMs. 

I learned the broker that dicked me last week (td - do not use - see recent lawsuit - same thing happened last week but they got sloppy as fuck and what started me looking into this bc I wanted to know who exactly was fuckingg me) works with a single MM. so I decided to Google who what MM robinhood uses. Apparently this is how they offer free trading. They route trades to whoever pays more. But the majority of them go through citadel market maker. Another what the fucking fuck moment. 

So there is a citadel hedge fund and a citadel market maker. They might be legally two separate entities but they def comMunicate. One invests in only derivatives and short stocks. And the other one makes the market and is allowed to accumulate inventory of stock. That doesn’t seem right or just doesn’t sit well. Who could make a killing off on options if you had a connection with someone who is legally allowed to manipulate stock price?! 

So to circle back to the beginning... and who regulates each:

Brokers - the SEC
Market makers - the NASB
Cleaning houses - doesn’t matter 
Hedge Funds - FINRA

-SEC is a government organization and has oversight on brokers.
-FINRA is a for profit corporation 

And NASB who has oversight on the real market manipulators... is a self-regulated oversight board. 

Who trusts this oversight?! My last what the fuxking fuck moment. Who the fuck would think this is an effective way to regulate “free” markets? How has this been allowed still and it’s 2021? 

The reason retail investors will always be fucked. It’s like the institutions at the forefront shield the people behind the scenes and manipulate the markets and tied to the hedge funds who don’t have to report how they make money to anyone. 

The reason nothing has ever been done about it.... money influences politics. One side more than the other. The SEC investigated this almost 30 years ago and issued a report on their finding which market makers sucks dick pretty much. The self reg oversight promised to do better. 🙄 this was before computer system like we have now. And why trades are directed to or should be directed to best available price on market. Lol td actually didn’t this recently and it threw me off so bad because price was a lot less than what I entered to pay. I was so confused.

Market makers serve no purpose in markets (except otc). They provide no benefit (not even 30 years ago). They can’t be relied on to do their job and provide liquify. They clearly work with both the hedge funds and brokers in abusive transactions to fuckk retail investors. They actually don’t even take on the risk bc they operate with almost no money. Their sole purpose is to rigged the markets. Something else has liquidity withoht need MM. 

The SEC is there to protect investors. But doesn’t have authority over who creates the unfair advantage in the markets.

The flip side is that random people using those brokers were at risk through no fault of their own, even if they were uninvolved in the GME thing, so I understand why they did what they did to some degree.

unwind the whole thing and 270m volume has to change hands on 70m outstanding (and even less float), that can run the price into the tens of thousands. at 69,000 or so (fine, fine, 69,420) it eats the entire 15-16 trillion in liquidity.

1616,DD," The Bear DD is far too easy for GameStop and no one wants to hear it. As far as the shorts are concerned the latest report we got shows it shorted at 73%(70 something) if he didn't commit perjury he could have transferred those stocks to another institution, bought them back, or some combination of the two. 

Regardless we all saw the squeeze happen, that 140% short was still there after Melvin allegedly got rid of their shorts. 

Thanks to a lack of transparency we really don't know how much it is currently shorted. Whomever had the shorts could have been slowly closing out the last month or they could be buying more, we just don't know.

1637,GME," I literally didn't have any position on Melvin until I read this crap.

He basically insinuates this whole thing with GME was an internet radical anti-semetic conspiracy against Melvin, and that he's very upset and concerned for all the little people who put money into GME.

His statement about being bailed out is basically ""Oh, total coincidence we got a new investor while we were hurting. They just liked our company"".

DFVs opening statement reads like a lucky young guy's play at Capitalism. Robinhood comes off as covering their ass through a very lengthy opening statement that boils down to ""we were just trying to do what was right and might have made a whoopsie or two but we had no choice between a rock and a hard place"".

This Melvin statement just reads as out of touch and quite honestly way too defensive. It was pretty gross that they combed reddit enough to find the 1 in 1,000,000 comment on this sub from some random idiot while we had 100k comment threads every couple hours during the run up.

You can make the they're lying argument for the 2/9 report, but then why didn't they lie for the 1/15 settlement date report on 1/27. Which rocketed GME. 

They don't benefit from not being able to back up that statement during testimony. They already lost a ton of money. 

For the record, they're idiots. They can complain all they want about people jumping on the stock with a failing business model, but it's their own fault they kept contributing to the >100% short interest that lasted for months.

1711,GME," Except he exited before the initial spike. Meaning that there were no significant losses to justify exiting his short position until the price rose enough to justify closing his positions. 

What I'm getting at is that he's implying short positions were closed before there was a real reason to.

1712,GME," you sir do not seem to fully understand what a short squeeze is and what causes it...

Citadel sells pfof (payment for order flow) info to hedge firms which then take short positions against the retail sector, so in reality they end up being short on a shit ton of meme stocks / small stocks, including that of the likes of GME.

It would not be surprising if Melvin was indeed one of the hedge funds that took pfof info from Citadel and in turn had a large short against GME due to this fact alone.

They claim they have been short on GME since 2014 bro, Robinhood app started around 2013.

I've seen posts of grandma, dad, and kids cashing out millions on GME.  Do you think citadel which had access to 40%+ of the retail sector didn't pass on that info to the likes of Melvin so they could short the retail sector or not?  c'mon, use your brain...

It's obvious what happened here, the large hedge funds were short fucking GME beyond what was normal or realistic and when everyone woke up to the 150% open short interest, new management, 2 new game consoles, record game sales due to the pandemic large firms bought in to GME as well.  Once there was enough rise in price there was clearly hedge fund blood in the water, and several other big firms went in for the kill (estimates said 11-20 large firms bought millions of shares as late as dec/jan; including the likes of BlackRock, the largest asset management operator in the US if not the world.)

1754,RH," I have a question about Robinhood, sorry I couldn’t post it separately as my submission kept getting deleted. Sold 329 deep itm call credit spreads on RIOT at $2/$3 expiring on 1/21/22 for $.99. Got notification that 25 contracts of the short $2 legs were assigned. I do not have the money in my account to purchase the 2500 shares directly. Also shows an account deficit of ~382k.

1.	⁠Is my only option without depositing additional funds to exercise my long $3 leg? I am wondering if RH would let me try to sell my (now naked) 25 calls, then try to buy 2500 shares on a dip to satisfy my short deficit. Do you think RH would allow this? I understand that this is ridiculously risky, there is not much in the account so I am ok with the risk/reward on this.

2.	⁠If only 25 contracts got assigned, does anyone know why the deficit shows at ~382k, when 2500 * $81.39 (market price right now) is only ~203k?

3. As the app now shows I’m in a margin call, how long do I have to cover the shorted shares (either by exercising long or selling long and buying back shares) before RH will start closing my positions?
