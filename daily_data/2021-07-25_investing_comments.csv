0,MIT," If you're looking for a model that isn't dependant on past performance, you'll almost certainly need a model that assumes a high degree of randomness.

MIT professor Andrew Lo posted an excellent course on finance, where he develops the theoretical underpinnings of market and project valuations, assuming am efficient market.

One of my big takeaways is the concept of covariances trumping variances. This is where diversification really shines: in a world where there's some sort of positive trend and a high degree of randomness, the best you can possibly do is start with some proportion of a risk-free asset (usually, treasurys) and as many assets as you can, in proportion to their market capitalization. Season to taste.

As Professor Lo points out, you'll have to adjust this CAPM model to fit the real world, since some markets are more efficient than others (this model doesn't work that great when considering international stocks due to transaction costs and other issues).",ChaseShiny,1,/r/investing/comments/or0fzs/this_subreddit_focuses_too_much_on_past/h6h30md/,0.019,0.832,0.149,0.9653
1,VC," The truth is that past performance does matter... stocks that have a history of growing dividends will often grow them in the future because that is a corporate priority.  Stocks with a good history of YoY growth will often continue to grow YoY because they are often in industries where there is an expanding pie. 

And on the flipside, companies who see their shares drop by 50% YoY will often see them drop YoY until they finally go bankrupt because they are structurally broken companies.

And to throw in an analogy, in the private equity or VC industry, past fund manager performance is often very indicative of future performance, because some fund managers just are worse a their jobs than others.",DrCam,1,/r/investing/comments/or0fzs/this_subreddit_focuses_too_much_on_past/h6h3ohv/,0.106,0.806,0.088,-0.5106

3,TD," All of those phrases have to be taken with a grain of salt.  For investing, which is a long term prospect with balanced risk versus return, you do want to stay ""in the market"" as the past has proven that normally will outperform timing the market.  It doesn't always outperform some timing of the market.  I believe in taking profit on stocks that are very high by having a trailing stop so in the case of a downturn I get out with most of my profits.  I then wait for an opportunity to get back in, or I select a new stock until that stock comes down enough for a re-entry.  So I do ""buy the dip"", but each person has to define these things!  For me 0.01 or your example of 0.001% is noise, not a dip.  I'll enter stocks that are down 2-3%, but for me a ""dip"" is closer to 5% plus.  Welcome to the world of social media where you will hear 10K comments on the market rather than pick up the financial page and reading 2 or 3 commenters opinions (remember newspapers?  LOL).

I think it is TD that has an ad about filtering the noise from the information... that is what you need to do when dealing with forums about markets.

Some people think day trading meme stocks is investing... maybe for them it is, but it isn't in my definition.  You are very correct with the part about learning and adapting.  This year should have been a great year, but it was one of my worst in over a decade (so far) due to me being too set in my ways and thinking I knew how things should be.  I had too much on autopilot and got hammered before I realized I was sauntering across the street in front of a steam roller!  (who knew they had turbos in them things!)

So no past performance doesn't guarantee anything, but the past itself is all we have to work with, so we try to make best decisions based on that and try to keep looking forward and learning and adapting to the new world of things.

13,BTI," People are sleeping on where the weed and green energy earnings will really be. Big Oil and Tobacco companies are likely to dominate both of these markets, simply due to their scale. 

It would be very easy for them to buy up any smaller competitors. The only reason we haven't seen this en masse yet is because those areas still aren't particularly profitable. The second weed is legalized in the US, you'll see the tobacco companies enter in a big way.


Similar for green energy. Exxon and others can easily crush any renewable competitors by either buying them or outspending them.

14,BTI," Nice post, thank you.

I would like to add some clarity on the US tobacco market that I was surprised you didn't mention in the barrier to entry.

PMTA make it illegal for new companies to compete with BTI. You cannot sell a new cigarette in the US, it is illegal. All “new” SKUs of cigarettes are just old rebranded SKUs. This is the number one moat big tobacco has 

Obama, in all his infinite wisdom, decided to regulate tobacco and vape under the regulatory guidelines set up by the FDA (which was an unbelievably stupid thing to do). This creates an artificial moat for vape too, where they basically are regulated like cigarettes. This is a newer development and only recently started to be enforced 

It's worth noting, and I won't say too much here. But non-tobacco plant derivatives are starting to hit the market. I think these won't threaten cigarettes, but they are a huge risk for big tobacco vape. The FDA is limited to tobacco-derived nicotine.

23,USA," **Right now situation in USA:**  
Stocks markets are very hot right now ([S&P 500 PE: 34)](https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-pe-ratio) which means earnings yield is around 2.91%. Bonds are giving yields less than that. In this situation stocks are still attractive investment in USA because of very low bond yields. Given this situation it is hard to get returns like 10 - 12 % in the next 5-10 years for the money invested in today. When I look at emerging markets like China, India there are some very good value stocks with very reasonable valuations. Given this I have the following two hypothesis.  
  
**Case 1: People who are already invested in USA equities:**  
I think for the people who are already fully invested in US equities, they have seen a very good bull run till now but it is very unlikely that markets will still give 10 -12 % returns in the next decade.  
  
**Case 2: People who are about to start investments in USA equites:**  
I think these people are with some disadvantage given the current markets. I think if they can find good value investments in emerging markets that can given 10-12 % yield, they should invest in them for the next 10 years.

41,GOOG," Forget the naysayers on Microsoft, as a user of their Azure and enterprise platforms, their products are all excellent and making huge strides compared to competitors.

As an example, PowerBI is rapidly outpacing Tableau in only a handful of years. I see Azure in job postings almost as much as AWS, and Microsoft does a much better job with integration and ease of use for their platforms. 

Other than Dynamics 365, Microsoft really is building top of the line enterprise dev tools and will continue to power enterprises into the new era of cloud, IoT, AI, and low code development. 

The current leadership team has also done a great job revamping their HR and in M&A.

I still think they can outperform the market and obviously will weather any downturn aside from a catastrophe, in which case you have other problems.

43,JPM," JPM should make a move toward 160. Maybe even a break out with a triple bottom formed...

It has had 3 higher lows in the past month and 2 higher highs. Usually up by $1 each time.

So next push would be 159 unless it breaks out or somehow reverses which is unlikely at this point.",DarthTrader357,-1,/r/investing/comments/or29ul/thoughts_on_the_following_stocks/h6fidaz/,0.035,0.965,0.0,-0.2023

50,TD," Most of the brokerages provide non delayed streaming data.   TD does a particularity good job of this with their thinkorswim platform and Schwab isn't bad either.   I haven't had an opportunity to play with the others.

I'd say that this data is plenty fast enough for any human in the loop type of trading.  I doubt that a human could respond fast enough for any slight delay (under 1 second or so) to matter.  

TD also has very rich conditional order types which allows the insertion of orders which automatically execute common strategies for day trading. 

If you're looking at algo trading, then you might want to look at interactive brokers.

Note that  you may want to ask over on r/daytrading as well.",Pass_Little,2,/r/investing/comments/orctrt/can_anybody_tell_me_where_how_i_can_get_data_that/h6hen4z/,0.068,0.798,0.134,0.779
