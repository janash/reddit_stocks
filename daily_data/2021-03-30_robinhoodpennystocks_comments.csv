Looks like it’s consolidating around $19-20 before it can cross the $20 put/call line once it hits $21.50 it can easily run up to $23-24 ranger again since 22.5 is the next strike and is more heavily call loaded it shouldn’t run into resistance until $25 again

23,PT," Despite watching $AGTC run up around $8 in February, I'm still holding 3,300 shares with an average cost @ 3.98 because a $10 PT for $AGTC is unbelievably more realistic than some volatile biotech ""virus play"" similar to $ATOS. Sure, I cautiously dabbled in Atossa, but it was done with the intent to buy more $AGTC. Luckily, I got out before $ATOS quickly spiked downward into the abyss; yet, $AGTC has been weathering this shitstorm of red better than a husband in 28 year marriage dealing with his wife during menopause. Applied Genetics Technology Corporation has had nothing but great press, amazing trial results, and even better price targets from highly respected firms possessing talented analysts. Right now, $AGTC is essentially Noah's Ark, and this ship is awaiting liftoff as soon as a singular piece of good press sends this stonk (and my life) into the promised land. Buy more, average down, and hold, see you in Monaco fellas.

49,CTXR," WSB, a sub with **BETS** literally in the name, doesnt touch penny stocks for a reason.

penny stocks are MM + pump dumper playtoys, they can swing the price with the click of a mouse and hang you dry. They have, and they will continue the practice.  The majority of gainers that post here are day traders who can scalp trade literally hundreds of times a day and often benefit from the volatility that penny stocks afford. See how CTXR dipped to 1.80, then flirted with 1.85 several times throughout the day-- less than a 10 cent swing? a day trader made *10-30% profit* off just that movement alone

stop buying penny stocks propped up by speculation and buy into stocks that have more solid fundamentals. There's Just as much money (if not more) to be made, while also providing you with better tools to handle and potentially profit off of volatility.

If any would be receptive to non penny stock dd's + strategies,  I would be happy to look into it-- I am learning as well.
