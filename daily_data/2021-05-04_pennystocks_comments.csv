22,DD," $BPSR today.

Organicell announced they have begun the uplisting process to NASDAQ. Recently, they are partnering up with CWI India with intent to file for an emergency use approval to use Zofin to treat severely ill COVID patients in India. India is seeing 2,500 deaths a day right now.

I like Organicell, it saw a pretty large climb this morning on this news and pulled back, still up from the start of the day. I am not a big player, I don't have the wealth for that, in 1,000 shares right now. Debating whether or not to move some other things around to invest in the stock. 

I like them, I hope they can do some good. My wife had been treating COVID patients almost exclusively for the past year. COVID has done a number on us, I left my job several months back so that someone could pull up the slack here at home for the family.

38,DD," I strongly recommend starting small. Don't put more than five or ten dollars in anything. A good one for the moment might be GVSI. It's expected to get good news today, so there's a chance you won't lose your money -- IF you sell while it's still high, instead of holding and hoping it goes higher later on.

If you search GVSI in this sub, you'll find several DD posts about it. Those posts should just be a starting point, though. You need to do your own research, and form your own opinions. None of us in here know the future. Please don't buy a stock just because you saw it mentioned here, and that includes the one I mentioned.

Expect to lose money in the beginning. It WILL happen. Penny stocks are a serious gamble.

Cant stand seeing people shorting a good cancer-research company and laughing about it.

But I hope a particular army of people who cant stand the shorting of good companies come in and make the shorts pay.  Because this just isnt right.

Just because a product is awaiting approval or launch doesn't mean it will be a success. I mean what even makes you think that the FlexFridge will somehow be innovative or competitive. There's just no way that the medical industry doesn't already have effective cooling devices or fridges for storing and transporting medicine or organs. I highly doubt that in today's age doctors haven't considered an alternative to using a box of ice ffs.

71,COCP," Penny stocks are more subject to volatility due to low market cap.  Although it looks like COCP climbed from last night's close of 1.20 all the way up to it's all time peak of 3.40 before coming down some.  That much gain in a day isn't likely to hold.

81,IMO," If that's actually the company that's reverse merging and their revenue is still 11M, at 3x revenue market cap and with this share structure it's already appropriately priced at .02 IMO unless float is actually much lower, but the math is pretty close. Might still pump but who knows. I've got a few thousand shares as a YOLO just in case.

That’s why they all clean the shopping carts after use etc. I also really like the option that they can put this stuff in airco’s.

85,DD," You think the news article is a paid for post or you think I'm paid to post the news article here? I can tell you that is not the case.   
I'm posting about Greenbank a lot because it's currently more than 40% of my total portfolio and I'm extremely bullish on this Company after I did about 25-30hrs of research (which paid off so far as I'm up $15K). If you read my DD and do a little bit of research yourself you'll find out that they have an almost perfect share structure, no debt, assets > $100M and sufficient cash. That while the total Mkt Cap of the Company was till two weeks ago below $35M. Even now that the price have gone up the Mkt Cap is still below the assets that they own. In my opinion this is a sign that this is a relative low risk penny stock even if the investments that they own don't work out. Of course if you have any evidence that this is a P&D, I would be very interested in it, however I haven't find any. For transparency I'm owing 15,000 shares at an average of $0.66.",Rensieo89,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/n4m3i0/greenbank_capital_acquires_significant_stake_in/gwyaa6k/,0.045,0.885,0.07,0.6151
