0,HRZN," As the others have said, HRZN is the higher payout because its yield is higher. But I'm a sucker for examples, so let's add another thought exercise like the one u/Unsightly_entity provided.

Say you had $1000 and wanted to decide which of the two paid more. At $17.51 (HRZN), you'd be able to purchase 57 shares. If you chose Reality (O) @ $67.68, you'd only be able to buy 14 shares. OK. time to bust out the calculator and do some simple math...

HRZN: 57 shares @ $0.10/mth ($1.20 per year) = $5.70 monthly ($68.40/yr)

O: 14 shares @ $0.2355/mth ($2.826 per year) = $3.30 monthly ($39.60/yr)

The bigger payer dividend-wise is Realty, but the higher yielding payer is HRZN. If you didn't care about share price or yield, then OK. Realty (O) would be an option and it's a very good REIT, but for the biggest bang for you bucks, HRZN would generate more money.

Now this doesn't even get into the whole discussion on which has a more sustainable dividend or which would be more sensitive to interest rates, etc. That right there is a completely different conversation and one, IMHO that should be considered. But if you're looking at raw numbers and ignoring all other factors then HRZN is the winner.",HiddenBlindspot,14,/r/RobinHood/comments/o5nrcq/monthly_dividend_investing/h2o6bnw/,0.067,0.784,0.149,0.9675
1,HRZN," $O is the higher paying one
The yield you are seeing is in a percentage for so 6% at 17 dollars (for HRZN) is about 1.7 dollars 
$O is about 2.8
So if you planned on buying 5 shares of either then O would give more money 
If you were to dump 100 dollars into one then 
(Assuming my mental math is right, which I doubt it is) then HRZN would yield more. I’ll actually check for you when I get home though!",Unsightly_entity,18,/r/RobinHood/comments/o5nrcq/monthly_dividend_investing/h2nqrae/,0.065,0.908,0.027,-0.4926
2,HRZN," As a guy who has both, O is a dividend aristocrat, so it will generally keep increasing it's dividend over the years. HRZN doesn't have that background, as far as I know. I still have it because it's cheaper and yield is high, but I make sure to listen for potential cuts. 

I think you should look at MAIN, also a monthly payer, price is about 42$, monthly dividend is 0.20$ (don't remember the yield %). This makes it a solid middle ground between the two and also has a solid track record.",the_stalking_walrus,4,/r/RobinHood/comments/o5nrcq/monthly_dividend_investing/h2o76mz/,0.032,0.892,0.076,0.4497

6,MAIN," Yes. Realty Income used to hover between 59.00 and 62.00. Lately it spiked to 70.00. Look at MAIN from the start of the pandemic to now. This growth over the long term sets it apart from higher yield dividend stocks. If you’re chasing yields and ignoring growth look into QYLD, despite the dividend cut to 0.19 it’s still a worthy pick for monthly income.",Workinprogress88,1,/r/RobinHood/comments/o5nrcq/monthly_dividend_investing/h2on50w/,0.037,0.788,0.174,0.8366
7,HRZN," It’s because if you wanted 5 shares of HRZN you pay less in a principle investment vs if you wanted 5 shares of O you’d be paying much more of a principle. If you’re hungry for dividends and don’t care about the stability of the stock, then you care about the dividend yield. So if that’s your case HRZN is your pick. You will overall get more for your money in their dividend payouts.",Tdech12,5,/r/RobinHood/comments/o5nrcq/monthly_dividend_investing/h2o9iou/,0.018,0.84,0.142,0.8555
