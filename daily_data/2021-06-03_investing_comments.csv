If they don't taper, rates will be negative by September and the whole system will implode. Too much cash/free debt floating around.

16,TIL," > it means society as we know it has collapsed

17,GDP," > civil society will cease to exist

My issue is with this claim. Not the likelihood of a long term crash/sideways happening, but that it can only happen together with this. It's total hyperbole to say that necessarily, ""civil society will cease to exist"" or ""that's the end of either humanity or capitalism"" in any scenario where markets trade flat for decades.

Japan is an illustration of how a stock market can do just that without society ceasing to exist. You lack imagination if you can't even conceive of the possibility of that happening in the US. That isn't to say it will happen, I don't expect it to. But I don't like this meme that the stock market not recovering for decades necessarily means the end of society or humanity. I think it's perfectly legitimate to imagine a scenario where things do flatten out in the markets but without the total collapse of society.

And yes, personally I am diversified globally partially for this reason, I *don't* want to be only in the US. But many people are.

Even globally, we have had a population boom for centuries, that is going to level off and stop, this century. Likely *globally,* not soon enough it's going to happen until the end of current people's lifetimes, but it's happening already right now in most developed countries and it's going to happen in places like China very soon. And developed countries have been the engine of stock market growth, if you go back 100 years, almost all the stock market growth over that period has been from these developed countries that are now levelling off. Is the US going to have this same level of growth going forward that it had while expanding out West, that it had after WW2? Maybe, maybe tech has the multiplier.

Then there's emerging. And I hold emerging. But there is no correlation between GDP growth in emerging countries and their stock market growth. So do you capture that by owning EM? Maybe not.

I'm not saying don't invest in equities, I do. I just object to this idea that markets are *bound* to keep rocketing up as they have done and the *only* possible scenario where stock markets stop their current trajectory necessarily involves the total and complete collapse of humanity. That's nonsense.",blorg,2,/r/investing/comments/nr6bp0/what_would_you_do_in_case_of_20_correction/h0gpnrn/,0.052,0.866,0.082,0.9435

Population dropping is...not relevant. Nothing suggests a dropping population necessarily equals a decline in markets, or consumption. Workers can be replaced by machines and AI, consumption can be shifted to sustainable and virtual goods and services. Flattening or declining populations and even resource scarcity don' mean markets can't operate and production & consumption of economic goods can't continue to increase. 

If you disagree, I'd love to see your reasoning and proof that ""A"" leads to ""B"" leads to ""C"".

>I'm not saying don't invest, I invest. I just object to this idea that the only possible scenario where stock markets stop their current trajectory necessarily involves the total and complete collapse of humanity. That's nonsense.

Object all you want but there's no reason markets can't and won't adjust to changes in *how* humanity progresses - it has historically done so plenty of times before. 

But the end of the markets themselves mean either we've given up on the system (moved on from capitalism) or the system has collapsed/failed (which, to be fair, doesn't mean the end of the species necessarily - but it does mean the end of the world and civil society *as we know it* as capitalism is more-or-less the lynchpin to the world.",kinnavenomer,0,/r/investing/comments/nr6bp0/what_would_you_do_in_case_of_20_correction/h0gs9wm/,0.065,0.871,0.063,0.0918

1. **Industry:** It is true that video gaming industry and gaming pc industry are thriving for the past couple of years, esp. pandemic-driven strength in 2020. However, how long could that last? Sustainable? I think it requires survey to capture the followings:
   1. Especially through the pandemic, many consumer purchased PCs in general. Wouldn't that pull forward the demand already, leading to a temporary pitfall on revenue?
   2. Have the current gamers already purchased a PC recently due to pandemic?
   3. What’s the replacement cycle for the gaming pc consumers?
2. **Competitions:** there are many more gaming pc companies popped out both listed or private players. Would that rising competition trim out Corsair’s opportunities? Worth to discuss.
   1. **Competitions against traditional PC players:** The traditional players have large economies of scales, distribution channel, and a designated Gaming PC series (e.g. ROG by Asus) to compete. What’s Corsair’s edge to compete them?
   2. **Competitions against Logitech:** How does Corsair compete against the good old PC peripheral market leader, Logitech?
3. **Product and Brand levels:** What are the key features unique enough for Corsair command premium and customer loyalty? Can its competitors replicate it or have a hard time to do so?

Stock futures are pointing to a lower open, with the Dow, S&P, and Nasdaq all off about 0.3%. That’s as of 0630.

This follows a second straight day of muted gains, with pockets of rallies (massive rallies in some instances. See AMC, Bed Bath & Beyond, Blackberry, and GameStop). Energy stocks and reopening names continue to do well.

Unclear what’s driving the inaction in major indexes. The market may be waiting for more data. We have initial jobless claims at 0830. That has moved things higher in weeks past. Expectations today are for 390k new claims, a slight drop from last week’s 406k. This would be a new post-pandemic low, I believe the third straight.

Lots of talk about tomorrow’s non farm payroll report, but as I’ve said before this isn’t the event it once was. Initial claims are more important nowadays.

All things being equal, it’s probably a good bet that risk assets take their next leg higher before too long, following the more speculative assets that are already trending upward.

Earnings will be in 4 weeks, and they already said they will beat their previous guidance, which was higher than the highest analyst estimate. Since their last ER, they are down almost 20%, even though there has been nothing but good news coming out about the company.

I'm very pro pot but I'm not that bullish on pot stocks - I own very small positions in a few MSOs (it is interesting to me that very few of the weed stock mentions I see on here are MSOs, they're all growers) and SSPK, but my allocation to weed will not likely go beyond a fairly minor one. I have no interest in pure play growers. There's still the illegal market, weed is still a commodity. People were overly excited about Canada's legalization, the companies there produced like every Canadian was going to get high 24/7/365 and then they massively overproduced - and there's *still* concerns about overproduction as of earlier this year (https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/cannabis-canada-weekly-a-billion-grams-of-unsold-legal-pot-may-spell-further-woes-for-the-industry-1.1552770) There have been very good/encouraging sales numbers in some legal states in the last year, but people are hyping legalization up as if everyone is going to be high af every day. Canada's legalization showed you that isn't likely to happen. 

There's also questions over the impact of interstate commerce if legalization happened and most legal states do allow some degree of home grow (although that isn't going to significantly impact people going to still go to dispensaries because they want it now.) Additionally, a lot of weed names haven't given much reason to be long-term confident in management.

I like keeping things that have high capital gains and dividends in the IRAs. Bonds in the traditional IRAs and stock in the Roth IRA.

Considering how much cash they were burning, assuming they don’t go bankrupt, a conservative estimate is another 100,000,000 shares to issue on top of today's announcement. 

*Nobody* with two thoughts to rub together would’ve closed out their short position in such an environment. It’s impossible to squeeze. Even if someone ran the price up, AMC has to sell to short sellers. AMC literally needs the cash.

Exactly, the price going up 1000% and then losing it all is basically useless for the company, the price going up 1000% and then staying there is actually helpful.

If you want the price of AMC to stay this high, you don't dilute the heck out of it in the middle of a mania, causing the mania to stall or reverse. You wait until the mania subsides and the price consolidates.

There's overvalue and undervalue assets. Then there's fairly valued assets.

with cyclical volatility, you have up and down in commodity.

To a bank, investing in Pepsico is a risky assets, but let's be honest, it won't go down.

I don't think anyone should invest in something which they aren't sure will go up.

I don't think pepsico is a risky assets and buying stock like Energy transfer at 6$ in october last year wasn't a risky investment, and now it's worth 10$. It's cyclical commodities.

In my book, buying ET at 10$ is a risky investment, buying them at 6$ is a low risk investment.

To your question, I would invest 0% in ''high risk assets.''

I don't understand the mentality of investing in a high risk assets. It's just gambling a small about of your portfolio at that point.

125,KMB," Thinking about switching to index funds

Hey everyone! I’m 26 and all my life my dad has been telling me I should diversify and buy good stocks in different sectors. I make about 60k a year and i just want to increase my net worth steadily over time. I have allocated about 90% to “safe” holdings and 10% to “risky” plays. (MP/PLTR). I have a 200k mortgage that’s my only debt. Anyways, looking at my YTD profits I’m sitting at only 2% gain. Looking at switching to index funds because a lot of them throw off an okay dividend as well as gaining a lot more than 2% for this year, wanted to know peoples thoughts on my portfolio and what I might be able to differently. I’ve been told owning a stock is like owning a company and if you cannot spend the time to research every company and keep up with it, index funds are the best choice.

131,AMC," Hi! I’m 25, relatively new to investing (thanks to WSB lol, I hold 5 AMC shares, and one Nokia share that I don’t remember buying) and I’m excited to try and make some money. 

I’m hoping to buy a house in the next 3-6 months. My goal is to invest about $1000 and see how much I can grow it to add to my down payment. I’m not feeling super risky, but I’m not against some riskier stocks.

I’m open to any and all advice in this situation. I figured just trying to grow a small pot of money is a great place to start and get my toes wet outside of meme stocks lol",vrose17,1,/r/investing/comments/nr8w0k/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/h0h23on/,0.027,0.79,0.183,0.9512
132,ATH," I don't know if I belong here or not. I got banned from Wall Street Bets because I mentioned a ticker. LOL

I just recently got into trading at the age of 38 via Robinhood and a small investment in Dogecoin. I saw that 2X itself and thought maybe I should diversify?

Bought a bunch of different stock with a $2.1k max to play around. Made some bad mistakes. Made some good choices but then they turn into bad mistakes. I feel like I've seen more red days than green, since April. 

My risk tolerance is pretty high but my instinct is to not go ""all in"" on things. I think I need more patience and would probably do well by just dumping money into higher quality companies and come back in 2 years to see where I am.  But after some of those mistakes mentioned, I'm in a recovery mode where I'm trying to get back to even. 

Stuff I have bought and sold:

EXPE - This was one of the first and most expensive stocks I bought. It fluctuates from $159-177. I'd buy low and sell high making $5 here and there. Looking back it was not the wisest move and it takes a while to recuperate from a dip. The original thought was Travel was going to come back in a big way in the Summer. It's an expensive play when you only have so much to invest.

CCL and NCL - Watched these two like a hawk again thinking it would skyrocket when they got cleared to sail. The rocket never really happened. Sold for a small gain, like $8?

I tried to play pump and dump with Ethereum and it would plummet anytime I purchased. I think I only made money once or twice doing this. I'm probably down about $50 total on this alone. 

I bought LTRPB by mistake thinking it was LTRPA. Who knew they had 2 tickers??? It is a sleepy stock and doesn't move hardly ever. When it does it's usually a massive drop downward. 

Then I learned about MEME stock.

MVIS at $18! SCORE right? WRONG. Immediately dropped to $12. I sold at a loss at $15. Had I held on a little longer I could have gotten back my investment. I'm learning!

Bought CRCT at the ATH (at the time) at $26. Sold when it dropped to $23.50. It is now in the $35+ range. AGAIN, I'm learning. 

After talking to a friend I decided to change my strategy a bit. I put a large sum into WY, UFPI, and BNGO. I liked the way they were trending upward over time and thought they would be a safer play. Lumber retail prices and lumber company stock seems to have little correlation. WY and UFPI immediately dropped. Sold WY at a minor loss. UFPI I am still holding. Maybe it will come back? Otherwise that's a $76 loss at the time of writing. BNGO is doing slightly better. They have a good product and are a profitable company. I believe this is a winner so I'm hanging on to that one. 

Along the way I sold all my Dogecoin for a profit to cover my losses. I moved that money back to my Bank account so I'd stop playing with it. 

At this point, I'm thinking of just selling everything and dumping it all into the next Meme Stock darling of the moment.

138,LTRPA," I don't know if I belong here or not. I got banned from Wall Street Bets because I mentioned a ticker. LOL

I just recently got into trading at the age of 38 via Robinhood and a small investment in Dogecoin. I saw that 2X itself and thought maybe I should diversify?

Bought a bunch of different stock with a $2.1k max to play around. Made some bad mistakes. Made some good choices but then they turn into bad mistakes. I feel like I've seen more red days than green, since April. 

My risk tolerance is pretty high but my instinct is to not go ""all in"" on things. I think I need more patience and would probably do well by just dumping money into higher quality companies and come back in 2 years to see where I am.  But after some of those mistakes mentioned, I'm in a recovery mode where I'm trying to get back to even. 

Stuff I have bought and sold:

EXPE - This was one of the first and most expensive stocks I bought. It fluctuates from $159-177. I'd buy low and sell high making $5 here and there. Looking back it was not the wisest move and it takes a while to recuperate from a dip. The original thought was Travel was going to come back in a big way in the Summer. It's an expensive play when you only have so much to invest.

CCL and NCL - Watched these two like a hawk again thinking it would skyrocket when they got cleared to sail. The rocket never really happened. Sold for a small gain, like $8?

I tried to play pump and dump with Ethereum and it would plummet anytime I purchased. I think I only made money once or twice doing this. I'm probably down about $50 total on this alone. 

I bought LTRPB by mistake thinking it was LTRPA. Who knew they had 2 tickers??? It is a sleepy stock and doesn't move hardly ever. When it does it's usually a massive drop downward. 

Then I learned about MEME stock.

MVIS at $18! SCORE right? WRONG. Immediately dropped to $12. I sold at a loss at $15. Had I held on a little longer I could have gotten back my investment. I'm learning!

Bought CRCT at the ATH (at the time) at $26. Sold when it dropped to $23.50. It is now in the $35+ range. AGAIN, I'm learning. 

After talking to a friend I decided to change my strategy a bit. I put a large sum into WY, UFPI, and BNGO. I liked the way they were trending upward over time and thought they would be a safer play. Lumber retail prices and lumber company stock seems to have little correlation. WY and UFPI immediately dropped. Sold WY at a minor loss. UFPI I am still holding. Maybe it will come back? Otherwise that's a $76 loss at the time of writing. BNGO is doing slightly better. They have a good product and are a profitable company. I believe this is a winner so I'm hanging on to that one. 

Along the way I sold all my Dogecoin for a profit to cover my losses. I moved that money back to my Bank account so I'd stop playing with it. 

At this point, I'm thinking of just selling everything and dumping it all into the next Meme Stock darling of the moment.

143,ID," I'm 16 years old and in need of advice on how to start investing in stocks and crypto. Any and all help is greatly appreciated :) 

I've been interested in the stock market / cryptocurrencies for a few years, and have watched as stocks I tried to get my parents to invest in skyrocket to double or triple it's worth, without them even batting an eye because they didn't take me seriously.

So I've come to Reddit to ask for advice on how to start investing on my own. I'm only 16, so I have no bank account, no money, and no steady job because I live too far from anywhere I could work.

So, how do I start investing when my monthly income is either non-existent, or less than like $200? Do I need a bank account? Should I get a credit/debit/other card? Do I need an ID/Driver's License to sign up for things? 

Basically just walk me through what I need to do to start turning the tiny amount of cash I carry in my wallet, into a tiny bit more cash I can carry in my digital wallet.",Aka_slacks,1,/r/investing/comments/nr8w0k/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/h0hp4v2/,0.039,0.862,0.099,0.8869

145,GME," Basically something that is valuable / popular via social media rather than being valuable by traditional means of measurement.

If it trends on Twitter, it's often something that is newsy and exciting. Something that is more traditionally valuable gets high ratings from investment professionals.

Typically the meme stocks have wild fluctuations based interesting stories not directly tied to the actions the company itself takes. If there's a good story to be had, like GME being oversold or Elon Musk tweeting Dogecoin, the market moves on the attention to the asset, not the value of the asset's performance.",ScenPath,3,/r/investing/comments/nr8w0k/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/h0fmbaw/,0.018,0.753,0.229,0.9715

Investing is not for quick flips, you have equities you intend to purchase for long term appreciation.  If you are just interested in trading, basically throwing the word ""invest"" around while also saying you need to make quick cash are essentially contradictory.

Regardless, yes its semantics, but worth considering.  I agree with the other person who said take that cash and pay down the CC.  You should not be tossing cash in the market that you sound like you need to pay off other liabilities, as you are just as likely to lose it.

150,NAV," Me personally, I only look at fees and portfolio structure. I place little emphasis on NAV because you end up chasing expensive funds (buying high). 

If investing for the long term taking fees into consideration is very important . A 1% fee will eat 30% of a portfolio over a 30 year stretch. Reminder - that fee is paid regardless of performance. 

The challenge is then finding a fund that can return at least greater than the fees being charged. If you look at the mutual fund industry as a whole only ~5% of funds will beat the index over a 30%. Note - I’m saying beat the index, not beat the index by a percentage greater than fees charged. 

Most of us are better just buying the low fee index fund and holding for a long time. It’ll guarantee average market returns and achieving average market returns is A LOT more difficult than it sounds, especially if investing long.",RexButs,2,/r/investing/comments/nrittc/should_i_really_look_at_the_expense_ratio_while/h0gtl6f/,0.054,0.862,0.084,0.5859

153,API," Fastly is a CDN (content delivery network). Any website, particularly those with static content (those that are article based, or even a site like reddit that has fairly permanent comments as their primary content) can offset costs for serving content by using a CDN to cache these static pages and resources rather than paying for the networking and server capacity to handle every request.

Fastly's advantage over its competitors (Akamai, AWS Cloudfront, numerous others) is its simple configuration interface using a version of the well known proxy, Varnish. It is exceptionally flexible, being text based, and Fastly provides an API which can be used to programmatically manage the configuration. Fastly also has an extensive worldwide network of POPs (point of presence, basically a data center hosting a connected instance of their service). They have the capability to bring up a new POP in a few weeks, which is fairly unique among their competitors, though for a customer to directly benefit (i.e. require a new POP) they would need to be exceedingly large and/or pay a lot.

As for customers, I transitioned Refinery29 (now merged into Vice Media) onto them some years ago, and will always advocate for them when their use would be beneficial at any company I work at, but otherwise can't speak to their overall strategy.",bschlueter,3,/r/investing/comments/nrloef/fastlys_fsly_ability_to_convert_and_retain/h0hfxw1/,0.006,0.945,0.049,0.7308
154,API," I have a cursory understanding of the offerings, and it's my read Fastly was a first mover (or close enough) to have an advantage and it's been slipping away ever since. CDN is competitive and can now be included with other products for cheaper by competition and do just a good or better job. Migration from one offering to the other isn't so cumbersome either (as it used to be years ago anyway) so I think conversion is a real issue they have. I haven't looked at pricing lately, but Akamai and Cloudflare seem to be chipping away at their customers. API integration is great, but lots of customers only need a simple GUI for their needs. Developer's generally will go with whatever is easier for them and personally I like cloudflare, though it's overkill for anything I work on right now.",EducationalGrass,1,/r/investing/comments/nrloef/fastlys_fsly_ability_to_convert_and_retain/h0hfqn4/,0.0,0.866,0.134,0.9542

158,INTC," Your picks don't look that bad. How can you be 2% YTD?

Also most people don't beat the S&P500. If you thinking about index funds then something like VOO would be good. Just think of VOO as keeping a ""cash/bond"" for buying a good stock you like when it goes on sale.

I will note that you don't have to go immediately into full VOO. DCA into it. Also if you feel overwhelmed by the homework for it then probably cut down on the number of stocks you own. Stick to ones you feel you know well, know their product, understand their business, have some edge over the average investor, and have ""high conviction"" on. 

That knowledge and high conviction will allow you to hold/add when the stock is just moving right, buy when others are fearful and selling on bad news, gain a natural feel on it's intrinsic value so you can trim when it's overpriced, and know when to leave when to get out when the core fundamentals change.

Take INTC for example. I have had that stock in my portfolio since 2013ish? I've been taking profit on INTC and buying back new positions when the stock drops. I have a general feeling of the price even as it progresses upward and have been right 5/5 times on when the sudden declines come AND the reason why each decline came. I would say it's tougher to call the bottoms, but you don't have to call the bottom if you're planning to hold long anyways.",zxc123zxc123,2,/r/investing/comments/nrk9v6/thinking_about_switching_to_index_funds/h0hb3yh/,0.018,0.878,0.104,0.9233
159,GE," > I’ve been told owning a stock is like owning a company and if you cannot spend the time to research every company and keep up with it, index funds are the best choice. 


I'd mostly agree with this. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems like you don't know much about the market and don't really plan to. 

If that's the case, I recommend being mostly in index funds. 

If you're interested in learning and monitoring, you could do single stocks. Investing for the long term doesn't require a ton of effort, catching up on your picks every quarter or so is sufficient. But it does require *some* attention.  Plenty of people bough a bunch of GE and Ford and let it sit there for ages cause they were the big companies then, and look how that worked out for them.",emc87,2,/r/investing/comments/nrk9v6/thinking_about_switching_to_index_funds/h0gzv12/,0.014,0.877,0.109,0.9201
