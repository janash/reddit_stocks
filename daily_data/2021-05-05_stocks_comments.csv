4,PTON, Here are my unprofessional thoughts. PTON has been dropping ever since the feds said they were dangerous.

I think there is a world where PTON can succeed long term (I think acquiring Strava and creating a fitness social media platform already based on cycling and running makes a ton of sense, as well as creating in person gyms and cycle bars similar in caliber to Equinox to maintain premium brand), but too much risk for my taste",newrunner29,1,/r/stocks/comments/n5ikkk/peloton_recalls_treadmills_after_safety_warnings/gx1vxxi/,0.061,0.796,0.143,0.8519

52,MRNA," Ok, some great answers here, some terrible, and some terribly funny. 

I split my money up a bit. First, I have cash in a regular bank account for monthly expenses. Then, I have my “grown-up portfolio”. That’s a mix of equities in all 11 sectors and a number of ETFs. Please note here... if you own Tesla directly and own an S&P and own a whole market & own ARKK, you’re basically buying a whole bunch of Tesla. So balance your ETFs out beyond just the top 5 or 6 companies that dominate the entire market. 

I have small, mid, and large cap ETFs. These are fire and forget. Put the money in and don’t look at it ever again until you retire. 

My horizon is 20-25 years so I have more in direct stocks than in safer, more boring broad market funds. Of those, some are value and some are growth. 

Then I started to play with my bonus income on my own, outside of the portfolio. I went into genomics, MRNA, stuff like that, I went into weed, I went into some Overweight international companies that I think can give me a 50% return in 2-5 years. I am looking to beat the grown-up portfolio here. I research to exhaustion, I buy dips, I almost never sell. If I buy it means I really believe it will grow to a certain target within 3-5 years or better. 

Then I tossed some into Dogecoin... and lo! Only my Tesla has outperformed this goofy crypto. I was super conservative so I won’t be a millionaire. That was the right decision. I’m too old and have too many dependents to YOLO on memes. But if you quit smoking, drinking, or buying lattes at Starbucks you really should use that “found money” in something crazy every once in a while. 

Also, NEVER fall victim to FOMO or Paper Hands. This is a business. Emotion has no place in sound investing. Set your rules, set your percentages, set your entry and exit strategies, then stick to the plan.

73,CD," A) set up an emergency fund and pay down debts:

 - 3 months of bare essentials spending in a CD/ pretty liquid fund
 - any debt with higher that 5% interest I would pay off

B) depends on how old you are for where to put it:
 
- 20's: growth plays. You have the time you can afford to be risky
 - 30-55: I would say all in equities, mix of growth and value stocks with at least 65% in ETFs
 - 55+: mix of growth and dividend plays, put it in things you could trim the profits/ use dividends for expenses in life (hopefully fun things!)

C) make sure to set aside 1-10% for yourself in the here and now. Check some things off your bucket list!

For long term stuff I rebalance annually. I pick stocks that I would want to hold for 3+ years and only let myself make trades on that account during 1 month of the year.

Diversification. With the kind of money your talking about, as long as you have exposure to at least 8 stocks in various sectors that all meet your personal criteria for a good investment then I wouldn't worry to much about it.

128,JNJ," Time and consistency. You are correct that you will need a significant amount of shares when you look at it today. But simply taking share price now and dividend now and calculating how many shares you'd need to buy to make a ""decent"" income is not taking into account many things.

Good dividend stocks tend to increase the dividend per share regularly. So in a couple of years, the yield for the shares you bought now should be much higher. At the same time, share prices should also increase. Somebody who got JNJ in 2013 would get 4x $0.66 at a price of around $50 per share. Today, share price is almost $170 and you get 4x $1.06 dividends. If you bought back then and get the dividend now, the yield for those shares is much higher.

You should also take into account compounding. If you reinvest your dividends every time, your dividends should slowly but surely increase. Over long periods of time, you get a bit of a snowball effect going on.

Last but not least, there are higher yield options but they tend to have some downsides. There are stocks that yield 7% reliably but they tend not to grow much anymore. There are stocks that pay around 7% and distribute monthly which makes compounding even better. And last but not least, there are special ETFs and strategies for increased cash flow.

When you say *any sort of passive income*, you need to be clear what your goal is. If you want to make a couple hundred every month on the side, you'll need six figures invested if you want it on the spot. If you're willing to wait, you can do it with less.

Here is probably the best way to think of dividends while you are still growing your portfolio: leave them to auto reinvest. If stock is high the dividend helps pump it and you have gains anyway, if it’s low you are buying on a dip so the percentage of share you are getting is better.

If you are really curious about dividends as pàssive income look at something that pays out monthly like PSEC. You’ll still need a considerable amount of money in it for the monthly payout to be something you could live off of.

138,AAPL," Dividend investing is a long term strategy to build wealth. Essentially a few key things to it are:

* Companies raise their dividends overtime, so you want to be in a company that consistently grows and raises their dividend each year.

* The longer you hold a stock the more your 'yield on cost' goes up due to said dividend raises. For example there's a lot of long time investors in stocks like MSFT, AAPL, MMM, JNJ, etc. that are getting 10% annual yields on shares they bought many years ago. These high quality companies dividends were never yielding at 10% at any point in their history, but they have been consistently raising their dividend overtime.

* Overtime the more dividends you have coming in the faster you can build your 'dividend snowball'. For example say you can only invest $25,000 a year. If you start bringing in $5,000 a year in just dividends you've increased your investment capital by 20%, which lets you build more dividend income faster.

I’m 32 and I just switched everything over to growth stocks.. super aggressive plays. My top 5 positions are EXRO.V, FCC.V, HUT.TO, PLTR. And I’m going to be patient with all of them for the next 1-2 years. I’m
Hoping to find good aggressive growth plays until I’m 50 then start averaging into good dividend stocks. Hopefully I’ll have a mill or two by then. 

Basically growth stocks should beat dividend stocks but they require a lot of attention and patience. You want growth stocks when you are young because you have time on your side. If you buy into something and it goes down you have time and income (hopefully you have a job) to average down and wait for it to make 100-500% gains Over the course of a few years. Then when you are older you gotta capture your growth stock gains and put them into solid dividend stocks so you can keep those gains and get consistent percentage returns/income from them

You’re using the word ‘yield’ to describe the dividend payment today relative to the money he invested in 1988, but the actual relevant comparison is what the yield is today compared to *what else he could be doing with the money today* or, if you really want to compare over time, how much he’s earned since 1988 compared to what he would have earned if he had put all his money in a growth stock that paid no dividend.

Here’s a chart showing what one would have if you invested 100% in AAPL vs KO in 1985 (stopping in 2012, when AAPL began paying dividends.). TLDR: the non-dividend paying investment was an order of magnitude more successful.

295,AMD," Hard to really say if there will be a collapse. There may be a correction in the near future, which would most likely occur in the event that the Fed hikes rates and/or tapers easing faster than expected. However there has been persistent talk of a crash really since we bottomed out on March 23 of last year, and we are up big time since then. So a lot of people that have been waiting for an eventual correction/crash have missed out on one of the best 12 month periods for stocks in decades.

If you're in for the longer term then your entry point does not really matter as much, although obviously no one wants to buy at the top. As the other commenter said, most of the expensive valuations are in tech (especially EV), so there's not a lot out there in that industry that is a great buy at the moment. Personally, the only thing in tech that I'm considering loading up on in tech atm is AMD, since they reported blowout earnings but the stock has traded down 10% since then. There's probably better buys in other industries at this point, but if you want to own tech and simultaneously worried about a crash, you're gonna have to pick and choose wisely.",KKrum41302,3,/r/stocks/comments/n5bwii/rstocks_daily_discussion_wednesday_may_05_2021/gx0zgyq/,0.07,0.855,0.075,0.4947

Take ETFs for example, half this subreddit has money in the ARK meme ETFs.

AMZN is a strong company that’s pretty safe to invest in almost regardless of when you buy but it won’t make you rich instantly. Something you gotta hold for a while to really see ROI. Especially if you bought in recently. 

Regarding current price, The market is in a funky spot right now and might need some time to sort itself out but as long as nothing horrible happens to the company itself there’s no reason to to panic sell it unless you think you’re overexposed and need to rebalance like I did with it several months ago.

## Analysis Methods and Assumptions

**Growth Rates**

Okay, down to the nitty gritty of the analysis. First, my estimates are based on the price of [REOs in Q4 last year and Q1 this year](https://www.kitco.com/strategic-metals/) - the calculations were baselined with the 2020 Q4 earnings as well.  I went with a YoY growth rate of 10% on the price of REOs and [that is conservative based on some models](https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/rare-earth-metals-market-121495310.html) but it’s a round number so went with it.  Given we have seen a spike in the price of REOs in Q4 2020 and Q1 2021, I’m assuming after Q2 2021, the price will return to the average of Q4 and Q1 and resume normal growth (yet again, conservative estimate).

Also, the YoY growth rate of production of 15% as MP has said in their 2020 earnings report they expect “modest growth,” and that is the reverse engineered growth rate from their Offtake Advances [estimates.are based on a 15% discount to Shenghe until they payback the advance of $71mln](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001801368/7c83b453-4580-4c19-935a-5d198af27e58.pdf).  This should disappear in 2022 as my analysis shows it being fully paid.

Fixed costs I have growing at a modest 3% since those should remain stable through the years.   They are a small portion regardless!  

Lastly, I have the cost of production remaining constant until Stage II is done - there was a 1% *reduction* in the cost of production from Q4 2019 to Q4 2020, so this should remain steady at worst aside from Stage II upgrades.

**Improvements of the Facilities**

The growth rate jumps to 33% for 2022 (also reverse engineered from their 10-K), when they expect to complete Stage II of revamping the old Molycorp site and is due to a much higher throughput of material.  The completion of Stage II also will make the process much cheaper, around 40% cheaper including the ramping up of their own local power generators which will reduce the price of power by an estimated 50%.  I am assuming this happens in the middle of 2022 for the calculations, again conservative.

Then Stage III will give them the ability to reduce the oxides into the usable metals.  Stage III is huge because it ends their reliance on China to do the refining and the company is suddenly completely independent and vertically integrated!  So as a result a few things happen: 

They can make a larger profit by selling the metals instead of the oxides.  The profit isn’t gigantic, [but the difference in price between metals and oxides it still gives MP some better revenue upsides of about 20% based on a 50% profit margin](https://en.institut-seltene-erden.de/unser-service-2/metall-preise/seltene-erden-preise/)
They also save big on shipping!  Based on the lower production numbers of 2020, it cost $9mln to ship the materials to China - and those costs are also likely passed on to the end consumers when the metals are shipped back.  This works out to be about 14% of the total cost to produce and sell the ore.  So when Stage III is complete, moar profit!

Continuing the conservative approach, I am assuming Stage III completes in 2024.

**Pricing Model**

To price MP and keep it relatively simple and grounded, since it’s a rapidly growing company still I’m using the 1 year forward P/E model for the pricing.  The pricing is also based off of the [Metals and Mining sector average forward P/E of 41](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/pedata.html).  

**Tariffs**

There are currently no tariffs for either the US or China on REOs, though there is a 10% Chinese tariff which could come back into effect in the middle of May.  Since it was suspended last year and there has been a huge increase in demand, I’m assuming it will continue to be suspended.",boneywankenobi,1,/r/stocks/comments/n4z2q7/mp_fundamental_analysis_and_why_i_think_they_will/gwyaj4l/,0.038,0.866,0.096,0.9881

Truly health-conscious people eat whole foods, not processed foods.  The fake meat products taste pretty darn good, but are still high in sodium and saturated fat, which defeats some of the purpose of consuming them.

While Beyond and Impossible appeal to vegetarians who miss an occasional hamburger, or someone at McDonalds - like you say - who feels guilty, I am not sure it's a real growth product.  It hasn't met its potential yet in any case.  Part of this is because someone who's at McD's in the first place is there for a guilty pleasure, not to compromise on some less-bad-for-you meal.

Finally, the partners are big enough players in the food industry that they may eventually create their own plant alternatives, leaving Beyond, er... behind - as it were.

The Tyson fake chicken is a good product. Bought a bag on accident and no one noticed a difference.

Tyson’s meatless burger has not been shipped to stores yet. It was announced a couple days ago. So not sure what taste you’re speaking to.

Tyson was the one on Beyond’s board. 

My comment was in addition to the parent comment. It’s not all about taste.

It’s also important that a manufacturer like Tyson can introduce hybrid low-meat options and market higher protein and lower sodium than plant based competitors. That reaches a wider audience. Beyond cannot do this as it completely contradicts their mission.

345,EMR," Sorry for the delay! I hope this helps!

1. Our EMR, and all others I've tried, has actionable notices/alerts on each patient that we can configure with our own settings. eg. Mrs. A's last mammogram was 5 years ago, they are due now. We also have query tools where we can find every patient that is currently due for a particular measure, as well, so we can address is individually or as a part of population management. Clover's appeal seemed to be ""full automation,"" but we are a part of several different reporting and quality programs that all have slightly different recommendations, so they ""human entry"" portion of the measure alerts is actually quite important to us. 
2. Depends on the type of update, really. We use eClinicalWorks and the software goes through complete version updates every year or two, minor bug updates every 2-3 months, and Rx/Coding/Measure database updates every month or so. I didn't get much info on the updates, but I'm guessing the 2-3 week thing is really only for the databases, but I don't know. Would seem unnecessary and difficult to train on if they made fundamental changes to the software that often. 
3. Our EMR has integrated TeleHealth visits for about two years now. Schedule appointments and patients just sign into their portal account on their phone or computer and we can video chat directly inside the EMR. Pretty cool, but they charge $2 every time we use it. Free for all other visits and no up front costs, so it isn't too big of an expense. 
4. I'd have to see the incentives! I tend to prioritize simple workflow for our staff and efficiency for our patients, so it'd have to be seamless to consider it, regardless of how much they pay us to use it.

What were you looking for when you tried the clover assistant? Or, what would have made you think it was a ‘truly innovative tech’?

I believe another portion of Clover’s incentive (beside doctor pay) was that while most EMR software has a monthly fee - the clover assistant is free because it is vertically integrated into a Medicare advantage insurer.

What were you looking for when you tried the clover assistant? Or, what would have made you think it was a ‘truly innovative tech’?

I believe another portion of Clover’s incentive (beside doctor pay) was that while most EMR software has a monthly fee - the clover assistant is free because it is vertically integrated into a Medicare advantage insurer.

1. They sent our practice a cold call email with the features and it seemed cool looking, so I tried it out. I tend to try lots of demos mostly just to see what is out there, but I never really have plans to make a full switch because we like ECW. It was more curiosity than a desire to switch, really. If it had been a platform that could have integrated directly into our EMR, that would have been better. 
2. We pay a quarterly licensing free for ECW and had/have some setup costs with new features. Overall, the expense is roughly $15k + $5k per provider, per year. I think the biggest hurdle is that it isn't using practice data, but insurance claim data. In theory, that should be the same, but it is definitely not in practice. We are also rather unique in that we don't participate with Medicare, so we have very few MA patients and wouldn't be able to use this for 95% of our patients. That point was probably my biggest reason for not adding one extra tool, even though it is free. At some point, there is just too much data and you can't expect employees to navigate it efficiently, so we stick with basic measures and just try to do really well on them. 
3. Nobody else has offered to pay us to use a service, so that is unique. Athena has a free EMR version, but it is ad-supported so our visit notes would look like they're sponsored by a drug company, which isn't a good look! The financial incentive selling points seem to be the ability to easily qualify for Medicare Meaningful Use, but we don't participate so that benefit doesn't help us. 
4. I have had more pitches for a direct contracting service in the last two months than I've had in 14 years, so I feel like a ton of companies are trying to jump on what they are as easy money. We are a part of an ACO, but are not subject to capitation. I think FFS is going away, but not until something like Medicare for All is passed. Not sure of the timeline there, but I'd expect 2023 to be the point where smaller primary cares actually start moving towards something like that. Our ACO has put December 2022 as their ""you must promise to at least consider a capitation model"" deadline, but we are not required to switch at that point. 

Lastly, because we don't take Medicare, I don't think we are exactly Clover's target market right now and may not be the best perspective on their sales pitch. All the commercial insurances are already doing their own similar thing, so they'll be competing with existing products from BCBS/Cigna/UHC/etc. if they ever mean to expand past Medicare.",tockstocks,2,/r/stocks/comments/n519uc/clov_investor_dd_what_is_direct_contracting/gx2h847/,0.051,0.8,0.149,0.9953

This is one example,  but it's representative of how long it takes to bring new supply of anything to market.   Cape wind started trying to get permission to build in 2009 and died in 2017.

Hedge funds count on naive new investors buying the momentum on earnings, so they tend to take short term profits and short it afterwards (directly and through options) in order to shake out those impatient people; after which they buy more at a lower price.

That's what you saw with AUPH after their FDA drug approval in January (and this kind of stuff was done to this and other biotechs also before that).

I've looked a lot into space plays that I can make now for the long-term (or even medium term in this case if you'd like), and rocketlab is the most solid space company around after SpaceX. They have actual products, having already launched 104 satellites (next launch is on the 15th!), plus they've also contracted with NASA to be part of the Artemis mission to the moon (sending the Capstone probe) and the Mars missions in the future.

VACQ is currently trading so close to NAV that the risk is relatively low IMO, especially because I do not expect this merger to fall through given the legitimacy and future potential of the company (compared to a lot of other lackluster space companies/spacs right now - cough cough Virgin Galactic). This play is pretty under the radar at the moment I think, once people hear about its potential and realized that if you want to invest in SpaceX, this might be the next best thing, people will jump all over it, so this might be an opportunity to jump in at the ground floor.

427,USA," I have a crazy amount of faith in RocketLab, which is becoming public in early Q3 though a SPAC, currently trading under the ticker VACQ. I've looked a lot into space plays that I can make now for the long-term (or even medium term in this case if you'd like), and rocketlab is the most solid space company around after SpaceX. They have actual products, having already launched 104 satellites (next launch is on the 15th!), plus they've also contracted with NASA to be part of the Artemis mission to the moon (sending the Capstone probe) and the Mars missions in the future. Their thing is 3D-Printed reusable rockets in the small-medium satellite space, which with the growing demand of constellations is going to be a big industry in my opinion. They are now based in the USA, but were founded and still heavily operate in New Zealand, having launch sites in both countries - with the New Zealand location actually having the highest available launch frequency in the world.
