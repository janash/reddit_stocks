6,ANY," If you enter employment with the motivation of taking and/or selling the companies internal or confidential information or operational knowledge then that is industrial/commercial espionage (yes it really is a crime).

However, if your intent is only for your own informational purposes: It is likely not a criminal matter.

However, there could be civil matters at play. They could civilly sue you for cost if your motivation was only to collect information and you take the job offer and sign an employment agreement in bad faith.

If you just do an interview and don't accept the job (or sign any NDA/waivers/employment agreements) you should be 100% fine.

If you accept the job, sign the employment agreement, and your only purpose was to collect information they could sue you for your approximate hiring and training costs (depending on the employment agreement and state laws) and the cost of any information ""leaked"" by you that may have harmed the company or its interests.

It seems HIGHLY unlikely they would waste time on any of that if you just took a job then quit after you have checked out their operations and such.

The stock is definitely carrying a premium and by no means cheap at all, but I'm not worried about holding shares of a company with great outlook.

They can’t scale enormously because their business model caters to individual companies needs.  I believe they only have 120 customers while being in business for 20 years.

If you have 100 shares of APHA, you will have 83 shares of TLRY plus some cash (for the partial share) after the merger.  The cash represents .81 x $22.34 (if it were to close at today's price)

So 100 APHA @ 18.12 = $1812.00

172,BGFV," I recommend RVRS over traditional S&P trackers. Long term payout tends to be higher.

NOBL is also good for outperforming S&P

Berkshire Hathaway Class B will most likely also outperform (although there could be concerns when both Munger and Buffett pass).

Smaller Individual targets I recommend:

KT

BGFV

VZ or T (maybe both?)


Full disclosure, I have stakes in all these except VZ and the first three are all position I plan to hold until retirement.

Addendum: yield and risk are incommensurable. If you can appreciate that, you will get smaller results than the aggressive 50%+ returns YoY people magically claim to make, but you can achieve above market results.

205,GME," I won’t bet on Amazon going anywhere. For it to keep growing it will need to hold what Walmart dose in the US, in the whole world but all online consumer markets within the next 20-30 years. In other words It’s extremely over valued, I’m not saying it won’t rise more since the market trust in that stock is insane but it isn’t good long term. 

Apple and Microsoft are tech giants. It you think they’ll not meet any competition in the next 30 years sure it might be good. But I also doubt that they have that large of a growth margin, compared to their turnover. Even if for example Xbox becomes the biggest consol and kills Sony. It won’t affect the company’s turnover all that much. 

A lot of the hype around these stocks are based the markets trust in them not actual growth prospects. Not that trust can’t increase a stocks value, but just as seen with GME it might not be all that stable. 

I’m not saying that they won’t grow but It might not be as good of an investment as advertised. They aren’t a easy sure way to make money.",Gorge_Cumsson,-3,/r/stocks/comments/mi84qf/where_should_i_put_10k/gt4vziy/,0.058,0.704,0.238,0.992

214,ICE," Deliveries up 109% and production up 76% YoY. And they even beat the previous record Q4. Beats analyst estimates from Factset of 168k (ranging from 145-188k) despite major headwinds. 

The major headwinds were Tesla produced 0 S/X in Q1 due to updated Model changeover in the Fremont factory, Q1 is typically seasonally weak for automakers, there were rumors (now confirmed in Biden infrastructure plan) about the expired US tax credit being renewed for Tesla which pulled demand out into the future, and Chinese New Year shutdown production and deliveries in China for 1-2 weeks. 

Given these facts, Tesla further ramping Model Y in China and starting Model S/X production again and fewer headwinds overall should allow Q2 to exceed 200k units production/delivery. Then Tesla has factories in Berlin and Austin starting production in Q3, which should allow overall production and deliveries for 2021 to exceed 900k and possibly reach Elon Musk’s stretch target of 1 million (Tesla’s official guidance was a vague >750k). This would mean Tesla could expand their BEV market share from 23% in 2020 to 23-30% in 2021 (based on projections for BEV market to grow 50-70% this year). All this despite increasing “competition”.

Judging by the future it is extremely overvalued as a car company and I know that argument goes its not a car company, but when it comes to energy their solar margins are at an all time low around 5% and the energy division is very unprofitable. As for self driving the thing people say is that they will lease it out to other companies. The issue with that assertion is that all of the other car companies are creating their own, the car industry is extremely competitive and competitors don't help each other. And the competitors especially GM have great self driveing systems. And as a final point many people assume tesla will have a car monopoly, but the one fall is that cars are a subjective market. People have diffrent tastes there are many who love tesla's cars and many who don't like them but this simple fact is why tesla and by extension any other car company will never have a monopoly.",ilai_reddead,5,/r/stocks/comments/mipbks/tesla_deliveries_smashed_expectations/gt5wckc/,0.069,0.811,0.12,0.9225

269,ESP," So you are talking about buying a rental property - not the property you live in? IMHO, One should own their own home before any major investment in equities or other rental real estates.

So let's just assume you own your own home( Maybe is not possible in some areas), then you want to deploy your capital to either stocks or rental properties. When I was young I bought rental properties instead of stocks - I liked having others pay down my mortgage. I did make money - but I could not handle the stress of managing rentals - so I sold and moved into stocks - much less maintenance.

I had a tenant who let her ex-boyfriend move in without my consent or knowledge. Turns out he was a crack head and threatened her and the other tenant I had. She left, but now the dude is using an ax on my walls for laughs, gets into a fight with my remaining tenant - police are called, find handguns, etc...I pay to have my ""good"" tenant moved out, but could not get the crazy dude out. Called the police but they said I would have to go thru the eviction process to remove him! So he leaves 1 day before eviction, but takes the ax to my furnace and destroys it as a parting gift!

270,FCF," Calling the stock market a Ponzi scheme is the silliest thing I ever heard. It’s literal and legal ownership in a company where there is something called the SEC to make sure fishy stuff isn’t going on. If a company continues to grow and increase earnings, stock price (ownership price) should go up because it means the company is more valuable right? Stock price going up is justified. Don’t forget about dividends either.

Also what do you mean by stocks being invisible? It is backed by income statement, balance sheets, and FCF statements. Real hard numbers. Educate yourself before saying things like this.

Reddit user comment about this topic:

“By that logic, any market in the world subject to the laws of supply and demand is a ponzi scheme.

You realise these tickers have companies behind them right? They are not random alphabet letters on a screen. And the value of the stock over the long term tracks the performance of said companies since you are literally buying a portion of that company.

A ponzi scheme has nothing backing it. It's a facade. There is no underlying asset. So sooner or later, it will come crashing down without recovery.

Look at a stock market chart for the last 100 years. There were times in history when it crashed by as much as 30%, 50%, even 90% (during great depression times) but it eventually recovered back and made newer gains. Why? Because it's not an empty vessel. There is an underlying asset.”",joeroganthumbhead,6,/r/stocks/comments/miaixy/stock_market_vs_real_estate/gt3vac7/,0.035,0.868,0.097,0.9162

TSLA changed their revenue standard so they could record leases in full at the time of signing. That was on them. This change was not forced on them as you are suggesting.

It looks like this enables them to have a lower Sales Return Reserve(a liability) as long as the ""customers economic incentive"" AKA Resale Value Guarantee(lol wtf is that and how is it determined?) is above Resale Market Value(again how does TSLA decide this which is in dispute)? Their Sales Return Reserve would be 0 until the car's value lost enough value the customer wanted to bring the car back.

Before this TSLA recorded leases as leases. This change 100% increased their earnings.

The space in a fulfillment center just doesn't cost much, the inventory that's kept in a pod in the middle of a massive floor that's only accessed by robots and people fixing the robots, and the stuff is stored so much more densely than it could be in a physical retail environment.

322,ATH," I'm focusing on all of tech, but primarily companies I know. Even if Powell raises federal interest rates early and we have another setback, which he has said over and over he won't so I believe him, interest rates are going to be very low for a few years. 

First let me summarized why I believed the cycle was already on the verge of turning back to tech, posted earlier in the week in an Ark thread.

Disclaimer, assume I have a position on every stock in this topic, even the retails.

Apple and Amazon started falling from their ATH quite awhile ago actually, before the rest of the tech correction. They bottomed out around 118 and 3000, both dipping below those marks even but not for long. Then they started to show resistance and basically trade sideways around 120 and 3050 while the rest of tech continued to sink, and finally early this week they were even rising and beating the market. This all showed a bottom out to me.

Disney was my reopening stock, crushing it and breaking ATH. The news and this sub was all about DIS and other reopenings/retail/cyclicals. But then they started to fall back on positive earnings. They got a one hour bump from positive park news, the next time they got zero bump from positive park news, and they fell a good 10% from their ATH.

By the time Roku hit 300, Etsy below 200, SQ at 200, it was time to put all money possible in. Even if they keep going down, at that point I don't believe they can go too much farther, as they were at their prices from last Fall, much like Apple and Amazon had bottomed out there. These stocks are going to fall to summer prices while TGT soars indefinitely past its ATH high?  Fine I'll keep buying down, but I don't think so. Now we have lulu being shorted as soon as they beat earnings and there's nothing but positive news, the same thing that was happening to the companies like Apple a couple months ago.

The bond yields should climb some more and stabilize closer to 2, maybe even in the near future, so there might be some more choppiness ahead. I wouldn't be surprised if it's not even that bad and we already got most of that priced in though.

FAANG of course is recommended, although I did think it was interesting Biden called out Amazon twice in the infrastructure speech and there may be bipartisan agreement against some of these companies. It's not like I see any major problems here, but I think their cash reserves will matter more in a year or so, so they're just buy as you can per usual.

My favorites are the household names or dependable tech stocks that are still way below their ATHs. I'm deep and long on Roku, just search the sub for the excellent DD about Roku if you don't really know what they're about. Their industry is mid-game, so room to grow, but also at a point where Roku has spent the money to secure their position, with an agreement with every major streaming service, pretty much every non-first or discount tier smart TV brand, and now their own advertisement company which is where their money flow will come, as they both help the streaming services make money while getting a cut. They crushed earnings and gave a better than expected outlook but fell $180, all I could post was to buy at point. They are not a gimmick, they are over 70% institutionally owned.

Square, PayPal, Zoom, Tesla, Etsy, Pinterest, pick your poison, there's more than I can think off the top of my head. I'm picking as many of these household tech stocks that have been around for years and will be around for years to come. I don't see a reason to get safer investments while these stocks are 50-75% from ATHs if you can ride it out long enough for them to climb again. I'll even throw out an Uber mention despite their bump in UK, because this is a household name product.  I hate apps, but I'm not deleting by Uber app anytime soon. Longevity and % of dip is what I'm focused on when it comes to taking on perceived risk.

Then you can look at stocks I don't even like such as LMND and FSLY. Fastly is still almost 50% from its ATH, sure I'll take a small position there. A short time of rising with the rest of the market and one positive news story and they'll be back to at least $85 or $90, surely.

People are over the semiconductor shortage by now after MU yesterday, right? Surely semiconductors, ev charging, clean energy, uranium, etc has room to climb even if they can't boom as fast as they did previously? 

Software companies? Sure. HPE was unaffected lately.check that chart. I guess it's because they pay dividends, all I know is they're working on every futuristic cloud and software idea. I won't even talk someone out of PLTR, we know it's going to continue being pumped daily on Reddit lol, but it's also by far the lowest Institutionally owned stock in this post I'm sure. MDB should be a good one again although it already got 8.5% since Thursday opening,it's 75% from its ATH and the company is going to be around for awhile.

I don't know your companies, and I like to focus on what I know, but I will look into them too. I don't think this tech storm lasts too much longer, and regardless of how long it lasts I'm riding it out if I believe the company will be a well known name five years down the road.

Happy day off everyone, hopefully the next quarter is good to you all. Just get SPY or something if you want to safely grow your money, I think that route will be very good to you this year and beyond as well.",suphater,17,/r/stocks/comments/migc3s/anybody_else_betting_large_on_midcap_tech/gt4un4w/,0.039,0.804,0.156,0.9992

First let me summarized why I believed the cycle was already on the verge of turning back to tech, posted earlier in the week in an Ark thread.

Disclaimer, assume I have a position on every stock in this topic, even the retails.

Apple and Amazon started falling from their ATH quite awhile ago actually, before the rest of the tech correction. They bottomed out around 118 and 3000, both dipping below those marks even but not for long. Then they started to show resistance and basically trade sideways around 120 and 3050 while the rest of tech continued to sink, and finally early this week they were even rising and beating the market. This all showed a bottom out to me.

Disney was my reopening stock, crushing it and breaking ATH. The news and this sub was all about DIS and other reopenings/retail/cyclicals. But then they started to fall back on positive earnings. They got a one hour bump from positive park news, the next time they got zero bump from positive park news, and they fell a good 10% from their ATH.

By the time Roku hit 300, Etsy below 200, SQ at 200, it was time to put all money possible in. Even if they keep going down, at that point I don't believe they can go too much farther, as they were at their prices from last Fall, much like Apple and Amazon had bottomed out there. These stocks are going to fall to summer prices while TGT soars indefinitely past its ATH high?  Fine I'll keep buying down, but I don't think so. Now we have lulu being shorted as soon as they beat earnings and there's nothing but positive news, the same thing that was happening to the companies like Apple a couple months ago.

The bond yields should climb some more and stabilize closer to 2, maybe even in the near future, so there might be some more choppiness ahead. I wouldn't be surprised if it's not even that bad and we already got most of that priced in though.

FAANG of course is recommended, although I did think it was interesting Biden called out Amazon twice in the infrastructure speech and there may be bipartisan agreement against some of these companies. It's not like I see any major problems here, but I think their cash reserves will matter more in a year or so, so they're just buy as you can per usual.

My favorites are the household names or dependable tech stocks that are still way below their ATHs. I'm deep and long on Roku, just search the sub for the excellent DD about Roku if you don't really know what they're about. Their industry is mid-game, so room to grow, but also at a point where Roku has spent the money to secure their position, with an agreement with every major streaming service, pretty much every non-first or discount tier smart TV brand, and now their own advertisement company which is where their money flow will come, as they both help the streaming services make money while getting a cut. They crushed earnings and gave a better than expected outlook but fell $180, all I could post was to buy at point. They are not a gimmick, they are over 70% institutionally owned.

Square, PayPal, Zoom, Tesla, Etsy, Pinterest, pick your poison, there's more than I can think off the top of my head. I'm picking as many of these household tech stocks that have been around for years and will be around for years to come. I don't see a reason to get safer investments while these stocks are 50-75% from ATHs if you can ride it out long enough for them to climb again. I'll even throw out an Uber mention despite their bump in UK, because this is a household name product.  I hate apps, but I'm not deleting by Uber app anytime soon. Longevity and % of dip is what I'm focused on when it comes to taking on perceived risk.

Then you can look at stocks I don't even like such as LMND and FSLY. Fastly is still almost 50% from its ATH, sure I'll take a small position there. A short time of rising with the rest of the market and one positive news story and they'll be back to at least $85 or $90, surely.

People are over the semiconductor shortage by now after MU yesterday, right? Surely semiconductors, ev charging, clean energy, uranium, etc has room to climb even if they can't boom as fast as they did previously? 

Software companies? Sure. HPE was unaffected lately.check that chart. I guess it's because they pay dividends, all I know is they're working on every futuristic cloud and software idea. I won't even talk someone out of PLTR, we know it's going to continue being pumped daily on Reddit lol, but it's also by far the lowest Institutionally owned stock in this post I'm sure. MDB should be a good one again although it already got 8.5% since Thursday opening,it's 75% from its ATH and the company is going to be around for awhile.

I don't know your companies, and I like to focus on what I know, but I will look into them too. I don't think this tech storm lasts too much longer, and regardless of how long it lasts I'm riding it out if I believe the company will be a well known name five years down the road.

Happy day off everyone, hopefully the next quarter is good to you all.

People are over the semiconductor shortage by now after MU yesterday, right? Surely semiconductors, ev charging, clean energy, uranium, etc has room to climb even if they can't boom as fast as they did previously? 

Software companies? Sure. HPE was unaffected lately.check that chart. I guess it's because they pay dividends, all I know is they're working on every futuristic cloud and software idea.

MDB should be a good one again although it already got 8.5% since Thursday opening,it's 75% from its ATH and the company is going to be around for awhile.

I don't know your companies, and I like to focus on what I know, but I will look into them too. I don't think this tech storm lasts too much longer, and regardless of how long it lasts I'm riding it out if I believe the company will be a well known name five years down the road.

Happy day off everyone, hopefully the next quarter is good to you all.

331,SQ," I'm focusing on all of tech, but primarily companies I know. Even if Powell raises federal interest rates early and we have another setback, which he has said over and over he won't so I believe him, interest rates are going to be very low for a few years. 

First let me summarized why I believed the cycle was already on the verge of turning back to tech, posted earlier in the week in an Ark thread.

Disclaimer, assume I have a position on every stock in this topic, even the retails.

Apple and Amazon started falling from their ATH quite awhile ago actually, before the rest of the tech correction. They bottomed out around 118 and 3000, both dipping below those marks even but not for long. Then they started to show resistance and basically trade sideways around 120 and 3050 while the rest of tech continued to sink, and finally early this week they were even rising and beating the market. This all showed a bottom out to me.

Disney was my reopening stock, crushing it and breaking ATH. The news and this sub was all about DIS and other reopenings/retail/cyclicals. But then they started to fall back on positive earnings. They got a one hour bump from positive park news, the next time they got zero bump from positive park news, and they fell a good 10% from their ATH.

By the time Roku hit 300, Etsy below 200, SQ at 200, it was time to put all money possible in. Even if they keep going down, at that point I don't believe they can go too much farther, as they were at their prices from last Fall, much like Apple and Amazon had bottomed out there. These stocks are going to fall to summer prices while TGT soars indefinitely past its ATH high?  Fine I'll keep buying down, but I don't think so. Now we have lulu being shorted as soon as they beat earnings and there's nothing but positive news, the same thing that was happening to the companies like Apple a couple months ago.

The bond yields should climb some more and stabilize closer to 2, maybe even in the near future, so there might be some more choppiness ahead. I wouldn't be surprised if it's not even that bad and we already got most of that priced in though.

FAANG of course is recommended, although I did think it was interesting Biden called out Amazon twice in the infrastructure speech and there may be bipartisan agreement against some of these companies. It's not like I see any major problems here, but I think their cash reserves will matter more in a year or so, so they're just buy as you can per usual.

My favorites are the household names or dependable tech stocks that are still way below their ATHs. I'm deep and long on Roku, just search the sub for the excellent DD about Roku if you don't really know what they're about. Their industry is mid-game, so room to grow, but also at a point where Roku has spent the money to secure their position, with an agreement with every major streaming service, pretty much every non-first or discount tier smart TV brand, and now their own advertisement company which is where their money flow will come, as they both help the streaming services make money while getting a cut. They crushed earnings and gave a better than expected outlook but fell $180, all I could post was to buy at point. They are not a gimmick, they are over 70% institutionally owned.

Square, PayPal, Zoom, Tesla, Etsy, Pinterest, pick your poison, there's more than I can think off the top of my head. I'm picking as many of these household tech stocks that have been around for years and will be around for years to come. I don't see a reason to get safer investments while these stocks are 50-75% from ATHs if you can ride it out long enough for them to climb again. I'll even throw out an Uber mention despite their bump in UK, because this is a household name product.  I hate apps, but I'm not deleting by Uber app anytime soon. Longevity and % of dip is what I'm focused on when it comes to taking on perceived risk.

346,ATOS," Hey guys, I'm new to all this like many others. Recently I've been putting my money into ""safe"" (REITs, blue chip, ETFs) stocks but when I first started I made some pretty dumb penny stock and small biotech purchases (industry I work in - thought it'd be fun) which are currently my worst performing. I bought in early-mid Feb on the way up before the market started turning red.

I'm wondering now if I should cut my losses on these stocks, hold them until they become profitable, or double down on some of the dips.

I am currently down over 25% on VKTX, FLGT, MBIO, ATOS, AZRX and GRCL. Anyone have any opinions on what I should do with these?

362,ATOS," I can't tell you what to do with your stocks, I'm pretty new as well. But I feel extremely lucky to have gotten out of ATOS for a 2% gain after FOMOing in on the back of a Reddit post and learned a bit in the process. Overall, it was a lesson in what Peter Lynch says - ""Invest in what you know"".

In general, what I've learned about the FDA approval process is that it means many hurdles and potentially many years before turning a profit. At any point in that process, if it fails one trial the product, the company's investment all go back to the drawing board. Even beyond the risk of failing the FDA approvals is the risk that, even if it gets approved, whatever product doesn't get used much or another product comes out at the same time that does the same job with fewer side effects or more cost effective or whatever. In other words, it's tons of risk that you have to stick with potentially for years before it might pay off.

It's an industry I know very little about to begin with (you may have a bigger edge there tbf), and with such high amounts of risk I am staying away from that world. If you have the ability to evaluate each company's products and the viability of each product, can keep an eye on other companies and what they are bringing to market, have a good knowledge of how the drug/product/whatever will work, and have a feel for how profitable that drug might be, can estimate how widely used/prescribed it could be, then you might stand a good chance at making a lot of money. You just have to sit and wait and be patient that eventually your confidence and faith will be rewarded. But I can't do any of that nor do I have interest in learning about any of that so I'm staying far away from that world.",Austinus_Prime,3,/r/stocks/comments/migse3/rstocks_daily_discussion_fundamentals_friday_apr/gt5jmdp/,0.052,0.817,0.131,0.9816

368,IMO," That's how I feel about ICLN.  I used to work in energy efficiency and so feel like I have a good grasp on market potential, etc. of some of these companies, and they all still seem so overvalued. 

I'm also very concerned that Hiden Biden and his handlers are going to screw up the utility pools' (Independent System Operator's) financial systems.  The TLDR is that they give regular payments to power plants to exist.  That is the main incentive to drive clean energy to come onto the grid.  They don't need more money on top of that.  They already have PHDs figuring out how much power plants need to get paid to spur more plants coming online.  What Biden is going to do is mess this up.  Imagine hiring an employee for $40K and then training them over time and giving them incremental raises, and then 5 years later they earn $70K.  Then all of a sudden Biden takes some money from your paycheck and some from a loan and hands the employee $20K for no reason.  That is what the Biden plan is to clean energy IMO.  It makes no sense and distorts incentives/existing systems.  Also, people are talking like green energy is new.  There have been solar panel rebate programs for 20 years though, and battery power is happening whether Biden prints money or not.",oyveyanyday,-4,/r/stocks/comments/migse3/rstocks_daily_discussion_fundamentals_friday_apr/gt5yy0z/,0.044,0.826,0.13,0.9585

403,TV, TV/Film insider here -- before investing I would look into the recent WGA agreement and WME's plans to phase out packaging and reduce production ownership before investing. This whole movement towards big growth for these companies was predicated on the fact that they would be able to act as producers (as well as recent expansions into sports as you note) and in my view they have been a bit crippled recently.

405,AMD," No. AMD is likely currently fairly valued at best, or possibly even overvalued a bit short and mid-term. 2+ years long term? probably fine but that might be murky too.   

The quick hitting points:

Higher than average PE paired with lower than average EPS

Lower than industry median margins paired with a chip shortage that impacting volume

Strategy flaw where they left a market void in the entry level and mid-range CPU market (price points under $200 and between $300 and $400) where Intel's new release is poised to land at and clean up. AMD still sits as king of the high performance chips, but that is a smaller percent of CPU sales. 

Did I mention chip shortage?

Intel releasing new GPUs and leaked info appears to indicate they will compete pretty well with higher end AMD and NVIDA cards. If the leaked specs are to be believed... Intel is putting out a pretty  insane GPU, easily on par with current 3080s at similar (MSRP, of course) $699 .  Of course that is leaked intel tease, but if reality is even in the zip code, this is a big problem for AMD and NVIDA.  They are also releasing  mid-range and entry level GPUs 

Because Intel makes their own chips, and can supply the market. anyone hesitant to try an intel chip might take the leap because they could actually get one. 

Long story short, AMD being a fabless chip makers is really putting them in a bind with the chip shortage, I can't feel good about the price in the short term and long term is murky because some inherent advantages AMD has built over the last couple years are being hampered by the inability to get products to market and unattractive margins. Intel, probably by pure luck, is getting it assed saved by this pandemic. Intel has a window to close the gap... they really do.",nevetando,1,/r/stocks/comments/min9jk/rstocks_discuss_overlooked_stocks_friday_apr_02/gt5sxxb/,0.13,0.767,0.103,-0.8257

Right now you have $19k on the line. Only you know what that’s worth to you. The danger is GME announces a secondary stock offering which, to be fair, completely makes sense for them to do. That will dilute the stock and depending on the size of the offering, the stock could be chopped by 2/3 in a heartbeat. 

I have some shares that I’m holding but I don’t have nearly as much on the line as you do.

It may be useful also for knowing the general sentiment: when there are a lot of bullish people and the stock is trending higher, you may consider  more DD before entering, viceversa when there are a lot of bagholders and bearish people it may be considerable to start a position.",setzer89,1,/r/stocks/comments/mir4v3/this_is_going_to_sound_dumb_how_do_i_use/gt65go7/,0.0,0.928,0.072,0.8271
480,MGNI," Perion is one of my largest holdings. I like that they are reasonably priced compared to others and that they have a tendency to be conservative and always raise and over deliver on expectations.

Saying that, TTD is the clear leader in the space. Magnite is interesting as a potential TTD on the opposite side but it’s a bit early to tell. Neither of these are cheaply priced though.

484,TSLA," Just be aware you’re going to be losing a good amount of money due to taxes and early withdrawal when you withdraw that money depending on what type of account you have. May be worth it to wait awhile to have enough capital to capitalize on a entry TSLA position, otherwise that 15k-3k (taxes) = 12k is a good amount however with TSLA being volatile like it is and spendy a larger amount may be warranted.

485,SPCE," Imo allocating most of your money to your top 2-3 companies is smart. Why invest in your 7,10 or 15th best company (in your opinion) when you can invest in your top 3. W this being said all in a single stock is much riskier. Maybe 2 or 3 could lower risk, or if you really dont want to take that money out for 10-15 years than I dont think it would be stupid to invest it all in Tesla. One of the best risk to reward opportunities in the market for sure. Especially when u see it as an energy company not just a car company. Also I’d like to say u shouldn’t go all in at once. Invest a good amount, and average down. This is called dollar cost averaging. Anyways I’m not a financial advisor so dont track me down if u lose all your money.

486,IMO," I agree with the others that it is unwise to put all your investable cash into one stock. I have some money in a mutual fund and some in TSLA. The mutual fund has way outperformed TSLA this year. Not that TSLA hasn't crushed the fund in the past, but my point is, by having investments in multiple things you can(hopefully) have a good return in one when returns in the other are weak. 

IMO, Tesla won't have another big run like the last 18 months or so in a long time.",cretinsrule,1,/r/stocks/comments/miq93w/tesla_advice/gt62h82/,0.04,0.851,0.109,0.6874

491,TSLA," Who knows.  Typical PE ratio for automotive industry is ~150 for Q4 2020, which equals TSLA $120, but how much of that industry average is due to Tesla?  Looking at the major established car companies investing in EV (F, VWAGY, GM), average PE ratio 20-30, which equals TSLA $16-$24.  I don’t think it’ll go that low though, because of momentum and also because TSLA isn’t just a car company.

So you might see pricing as a mix of tech and automotive.  However it’s currently priced at 1340 PE, which is something you’d see in a tech startup (which they no longer are).  I think they’ll have to drop below the 400s (where even Elon said it was overpriced), but you’ll probably see a new EV industry standard valuation based on where they land.

TLDR: probably somewhere between 120-400.  Who knows.",SoapHorse69,2,/r/stocks/comments/miq93w/tesla_advice/gt66s4m/,0.058,0.942,0.0,-0.7964
492,IMO," at a glance, the stock is decent. listed on the NYSE which has pretty strict requirements. the stock appears to be overvalued, but the company seems very profitable and has a large cash cushion. South Africa is considered an emerging market, but they have some good companies.
