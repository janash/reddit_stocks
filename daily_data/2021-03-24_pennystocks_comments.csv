6,TLRY," In what time frame? We should also not be talking about share price since that is only related to the amount of shares out there. So TLRY has a market cap of about 4 billion USD on 190 million revenue and a 20% yoy growth. HITI has a market cap of 420 million on a revenue of 83 million and a 166% yoy growth, with revenue forecasted to more than double this year. The former is not profitable, the latter is. You do the math. 

But also do note they're kinda in different business, TLRY is cultivator and producer HITI is a retailer. So the growth potential is imo higher for a producer but that sector has a stiff competition, the retail is a safer play and more easily made and kept profitable. Kinda like comparing apples to oranges.

If you ask me, most ""large"" cap cannabis stocks are already overvalued, HITI is undervalued.",Iskari,6,/r/pennystocks/comments/mc21zo/high_tide_completes_smoke_cartel_acquisition/gs2j665/,0.03,0.834,0.136,0.9317

Apple has a market cap of 2.0 trillion, that also is a lot of money, but I'd still be willing to buy more if I had cash in hand and wanted to invest in a giga cap tech stock, since it has a lot of upwards runway imo.

Go to High Tide subreddit and read the stickied analysis by ATB Capital.

The Company also announces that it will hold an online special investors meeting March 25th, 2021, (See details below).
 
Highlights
-          Exploits defined two high priority targets at the Jonathan’s Pond Gold Project JP Vein, and a 2-kilometre long demagnetized fault zone.
-          The JP Vein target contains high grade gold in quartz veining up to 28 g/t Au, low grade gold in wall rock returning 0.44 g/t Au over 5 meters, including 1 meter at 0.80 g/t Au in trenching, and a further 300 metres of anomalous unexplored strike length of gold indicated by Spatiotemporal Gas Hydrocarbon (SGH) soil samples.

With the craze of NFT stocks, including CIDM, WKEY, HOFV, MKGI, GRNQ, TKAT, OCG, YVR and others, I want you to all take a look at IZEA.

Izea has truly become a reputable company in the recent months. There is a reason the company is doing honest work with fortune 500c fortune 100 companies and are still being renewed every time the contract is done.

Their partnerships(including recent ones) give them a full range access to NBA players, NFL players, tik tok, twitch, youtuber influencers. For example, justmaiko is an extremely popular tik toker using their brandgraph platform.

However, aside from their amazing influencer/digital advertising side of the business, I want to take a look at their NFT side.

First of all, IZEA has all this access and partnerships with major influencers. With the hype of NFT, a lot of content or works created by these influencers should be interested in creating NFTs to sell. IZEA hosts a digital marketplace where over 3.9 million transactions have occurred. 

In addition, Ted Murphy has public stated his support for NFT and tweeted about selling NFT. Izea is always a company looking to hop on trends with digital media, and I have no doubt Ted Murphy is already looking into ways to implement NFT into their company.

They have already paved the way after involving IZEA with crypto, having celebrity identities and producing content through the top 25 cryptos including ETH which is what NFTs are trading on. 

IZEA owns this platform, along with their nearly 1m users + influencers + digital marketplace + crypto angle.

I really think IZEA will become associated with NFT very soon so I bought in for 5k shares during today’s dip. We’ve seen every company that comes out with NFT pr go up 50-200%+.

The MACD is showing an accelerated decline in the stock.  The chakin money flow shows cash exiting the stock.  The current price trend has broken the lower bollinger band.
