No. Lending standards were crazy loose in '08, and are pretty tight now. This will prevent a crash. Everyone who is able to buy a house in the current market can afford it (assuming their life situation does not take a dramatic turn for the worse after purchase).  At most, I'd expect a moderate easing of prices as supply catches up to demand, prices become too high for people to afford, and interest rates rise. Most likely is that prices will continue to go up, but slower.

49,APR," Short answer; no. 

Long answer: the increase in prices and perceived decrease in sales also corresponds with a decrease in new build houses being completed. Lack of labour, materials and funding caused by the covid lockdowns have hit the supply of new build houses entering the market. 

This has severely limited supply, resulting in the high prices. This means when the houses come to market, the prices will fall right, the supply increases again resulting on the price falling, simple economics. 

Except these new builds will be sold at an inflated price to cover the additional costs of labour and materials and account for the delays to construction.  If you take out $100 million loan to build 1000 new homes and your loan is 3% APR and each house costs 5% more because of the costs of materials and labour, but you were smart, so you budgeted for that. But the project has been delayed by 4 months as you struggle to find suppliers. It's not just the 5% cost of the houses, but also the interest on the additional 4 month where you can't pay off your loans because you haven't built the houses yet. 

So the new builds won't bring the prices down, but they will give more people the opportunity to buy. Its a sellers market, the developers can name their price. After all, people will always need somewhere to live. While speculative investors and people hedging against inflation will fill in the gaps. 

What it will do is increase the number of house sales back up to pre pandemic levels, which is the trigger that suggests a correction is incoming. 

And that ignores government intervention in the markets. If house prices start to fall over the medium to long term, banks stop offering mortgages, and start increasing interests rates. After all, they need to cover their own asses, and a depreciating house isn't going to work for them if the owner defaults on the mortgage. So what happens is the government moves in to prop up house prices. Offering help to buy schemes, offering loan guarantees. Offering straight up cash to help people buy homes. 

Why do they do this instead of just letting the crash happen? The majority of Americans own their own home, or has a mortgage. If the government let the housing market crash, that would be millions of people homeless and millions more losing the majority of their perceived wealth which is tied up in their home. No democratic government is going to let that happen. Until renters outnumber homeowners, you won't find a government willing to let the housing market crash. In the mean time they will try so hard to increase the number of homeowners through the aforementioned help to buy schemes in order to show on the surface at least that they care. While propping up the housing market for themselves, their wealthy friends and the millions of Americans that own their own homes.",Bendetto4,1,/r/investing/comments/oawyqu/is_there_a_correction_looming_in_housing_prices/h3lwnth/,0.07,0.827,0.103,0.9652

53,UK," I don't know how well that holds true these days tbh. Landlords use renters to pay off their mortgages so you almost always end up paying more out as a renter, at least in the UK. Additionally, house prices shot up another 14% last year which is the biggest increase we've seen since 2004.

For me though, the main problem with renting is when you come to retire. Our salaries are very low here compared to the US (and pensions are paltry compared to what they used to be) and the idea of that is that you have fewer expenses as a pensioner. The main expense you have as a human is rent/mortgage but if you have a mortgage, that's paid off by the time you retire, which significantly reduces your outgoings. If you're renting on the other hand you're going to have less money coming in because you're on a shitty pension, but ever inflating living costs because you've had to rent forever.",_DeanRiding,21,/r/investing/comments/oawyqu/is_there_a_correction_looming_in_housing_prices/h3kmxcm/,0.065,0.888,0.046,-0.2967

That's not true, at least not for the US anymore. In almost any major city (or even smaller towns) and surrounding areas, unless you live in an absolute dump of an area, rent is always more expensive than mortgage for an equivalent house. We just bought a house and our monthly mortgage payment (30 years at 3% fixed) is about $1,370, and yet to rent a house of the same size and backyard space, etc. would cost over $2,500 a month. Before buying this house, we were in a tiny little 2-bedroom apartment in a much worse area (not the absolute ghetto but significantly worse than where we live now) and the rent was almost $1,100 a month. And we don't even live in an expensive part of the country. Now I'm sure there are specific instances where buying may be too expensive, like SF or NYC, but for most of the continental US, I'd say buying is still probably cheaper in the long run.",perennialpurist,2,/r/investing/comments/oawyqu/is_there_a_correction_looming_in_housing_prices/h3le9pp/,0.058,0.909,0.033,-0.3952

We just bought a house and our monthly mortgage payment (30 years at 3% fixed) is about $1,370, and yet to rent a house of the same size and backyard space, etc. would cost over $2,500 a month. Before buying this house, we were in a tiny little 2-bedroom apartment in a much worse area (not the absolute ghetto but significantly worse than where we live now) and the rent was almost $1,100 a month. And we don't even live in an expensive part of the country. Now I'm sure there are specific instances where buying may be too expensive, like SF or NYC, but for most of the continental US, I'd say buying is still probably cheaper in the long run.",perennialpurist,2,/r/investing/comments/oawyqu/is_there_a_correction_looming_in_housing_prices/h3le9pp/,0.058,0.909,0.033,-0.3952

61,IMO," IMO institutional/investment buying has really been driving prices up since March 2020. Maybe biased as I work in tech in CA but everyone I know from work is trying to buy investment property thinking that it will at least go up for another 3-ish years due to inflation. Friends outside of work are lamenting not owning and have major FOMO.

Institutional investors (i.e. blackrock et al) are buying apartment blocks in CA. There has to be a good reason for that. It's going to take a while but renters and owners will be evicted from SFHs months after moratoriums expire. Even assuming typical rates prior to covid, there should be a big backlog waiting to get kicked out. As the displaced non-payment people start to seek new housing, rents will go up and many will end up downsizing. This is what happened in 2008 when people started losing their homes to foreclosure in CA. Maybe that is the play.

I suspect large/expensive single family homes in CA are going to start losing value eventually, followed by the the rest of the SFH market. Other than the boon from recent wealthy pandemic buyers looking to upsize, that segment has been soft since \~2016 compared to smaller less expensive homes. Living in a 3000 sq/ft house just doesn't make sense in inflationary times. Even people making $150k may not be able to afford a $4k/month house payment (on the home they bought in 2015 for $800k that is maybe worth $1.2million now) when utilities and food start to cost $2000/month. Throw in the typical $800/month car payment and suddenly monthly bills are not manageable. These types of finances are typical in our circle of friends with families.

Many have not factored inflation and tax increases into their budgets looking ahead the next 5 years. Both of those things are inevitable considering what the Federal reserve is doing and the sheer amount of debt the government is building up.

IMO, the real estate market in CA looks very spooky. Yes not 2008, but still scary for different reasons. I think upper middle class and families specifically may get crushed this time around vs 2008 which was largely young people and first time home buyers.

There is also going to be downward pressure on some higher priced communities due to the shift to more permanent remote workers next year.

If companies stat to downsize white collar jobs due to inflationary pressures it will accelerate the process.",sdguero,3,/r/investing/comments/oawyqu/is_there_a_correction_looming_in_housing_prices/h3l51fq/,0.081,0.856,0.063,-0.7455

73,TDOC," The actively managed ETF approach only works if you have a good active manager that you can trust. When I bought into ARKG (before March 2020), their top 10 holdings contained all the biggest CRISPR, sequencing, and sequencing-based liquid biopsy stocks. It was a great representation of the genomics field. Now the top holdings are all over the place. In the last few months their top holding was TDOC. Now TDOC is a fine company, I own it separately myself. But it is a teleconferencing company, NOT a genomics company. And Cathie Wood has been doing this sort of thing in her other ETFs as well. As an investor, it makes me concerned that I'm not actually investing in the ""genomics revolution"" by investing in ARKG.

Where does TDOC fit in there? I don't really know. It certainly doesn't develop, produce, or enable any of the listed items (does it?).

I like the company too, but there are a few things to consider before moving into Sofi: 

* We're in an expansion phase where everything is working and valuations can/are be out whack. That can include SoFi due to it's speculative growth nature AND being a popular name/stock.

* There's also the very heavy dilution associated with this IPO in particular. Early investors, employees, 2nd/3rd round investors, Chamath, SPAC investors, PIPE investors, etcetc. May of whom bought under $10. Heavy dilution will mean shares aren't worth as much and thing can be easily manipulated.

* I still believe Chamath is an investor at his core and I believe in his ability to get profitable businesses onto the market for himself/investors, but he's shown with SPCE that he's not unwilling to dump HARD if he feels something is overpriced or feels the tables turn. You'll have to have this memory in the back of your mind along with a contingency plan in case of a rug pull or dump causing shares to fall. You should have these thought out BEFORE committing into any of the Chamath stocks.

* While on Chamath, his SPAC methods have really helped the early investors, PIPE, and himself. The regular investor buying on the market or post-IPO have been mixed. SPCE swings wildly and doesn't seem to have settled yet, OPEN is still in growth phase and we haven't seen long enough profits, CLOV is something I wouldn't touch, and SOFI is a solid growth company but faces a lot of competition.

* WSB speculation. It's already hard to value the true value of a company in this market already. WSB makes it even harder. I would usually avoid or cut stuff that I see is getting the WSB pump because I know I can probably get back in at a lower cost when it drops when they get bored of it. Not saying it's a reason to NOT buy Sofi. More of an extra reason to just be careful when it's getting pumped.

* Lastly, on to SoFi itself. I think it's a good company. I main worries are about the dilution. Odds of a Chamath rugpull. WSB speculation. SPACs listing method leaving a lot of vetting on the table. And those things AREN'T about the company itself. That's a good sign as OP has mentioned. But there's also the sheer competition in the FinTech space. The trad banks and other businesses are adapting to tech disruptors cause they know they'll be dead if they don't. The easy days of AMZN/GOOG/UBER-LYFT killing retail/newspapers/taxis with little resistance are gone. All the streamers are fighting back against NFLX, the automakers are all throwing down the EV gauntlet on TSLA, every online brokers now offer RH style """"""free trades"""""" without the outage/customer support problems, the big hotels and booking sites now offer their own ""ABNB"" style rental system, and the big banks will do the same. Also there are a lot of SoFi alternatives or potential alternatives in the FinTech space: Cap1, Ally, M1, PPal, SQ, the FAAAMs, the Trad banks, and a ton more for each oversea country. EVERYONE is trying to be the big super app. SoFi has a small lead, but it's not TSLA. There is also the threat of newer ""FinTech"" start ups and companies going in. That's before facotring that ""FinTech"" apps themselves are already facing disruption from DeFi.

I don't own SoFi. But I have a small stake on OPEN. Much of the Chamath/SPAC concerns I listed here are my assessment of IPOE/SOFI before merger and my assessment of risk for Chamath/SPACs before I entered my OPEN position.

I like the company too, but there are a few things to consider before moving into Sofi: 

* We're in an expansion phase where everything is working and valuations can/are be out whack. That can include SoFi due to it's speculative growth nature AND being a popular name/stock.

* There's also the very heavy dilution associated with this IPO in particular. Early investors, employees, 2nd/3rd round investors, Chamath, SPAC investors, PIPE investors, etcetc. May of whom bought under $10. Heavy dilution will mean shares aren't worth as much and thing can be easily manipulated.

* I still believe Chamath is an investor at his core and I believe in his ability to get profitable businesses onto the market for himself/investors, but he's shown with SPCE that he's not unwilling to dump HARD if he feels something is overpriced or feels the tables turn. You'll have to have this memory in the back of your mind along with a contingency plan in case of a rug pull or dump causing shares to fall. You should have these thought out BEFORE committing into any of the Chamath stocks.

* While on Chamath, his SPAC methods have really helped the early investors, PIPE, and himself. The regular investor buying on the market or post-IPO have been mixed. SPCE swings wildly and doesn't seem to have settled yet, OPEN is still in growth phase and we haven't seen long enough profits, CLOV is something I wouldn't touch, and SOFI is a solid growth company but faces a lot of competition.

* WSB speculation. It's already hard to value the true value of a company in this market already. WSB makes it even harder. I would usually avoid or cut stuff that I see is getting the WSB pump because I know I can probably get back in at a lower cost when it drops when they get bored of it. Not saying it's a reason to NOT buy Sofi. More of an extra reason to just be careful when it's getting pumped.

* Lastly, on to SoFi itself. I think it's a good company. I main worries are about the dilution. Odds of a Chamath rugpull. WSB speculation. SPACs listing method leaving a lot of vetting on the table. And those things AREN'T about the company itself. That's a good sign as OP has mentioned.

EVERYONE is trying to be the big super app. SoFi has a small lead, but it's not TSLA. There is also the threat of newer ""FinTech"" start ups and companies going in. That's before facotring that ""FinTech"" apps themselves are already facing disruption from DeFi.

I don't own SoFi. But I have a small stake on OPEN. Much of the Chamath/SPAC concerns I listed here are my assessment of IPOE/SOFI before merger and my assessment of risk for Chamath/SPACs before I entered my OPEN position.

95,SOFI," [My SOFI contract](https://imgur.com/a/6Hel1V8)

You can laugh at me, I deserve it, but also I seek advice if you can offer it.. wtf should I do here to minimize my losses?

I actually didn't realize I was trading on a margin account.. it was just a normal investing acct before I applied to trade options.

I put in 2k cad and when I made the order for 20 contracts it quoted me roughly 1k CAD.. I was fine with possibly losing 1k as a learning experience.

I'm now seeing this is a potentially much bigger mistake 😂 I still don't fully understand what happened.. I made an order that cost more than the amount of cash I had in my margin account? Is that it?

How much $ could I lose here... Ruh roh.

98,USA," So, passive funds will track an index.  For example,

S&P 500 index:  500 USA stocks chosen to mirror the market.

ETF/funds that track the S&P500: VOO SPY FXAIX SWPPX

These track the entire USA stock market: VTI VTSAX SWTSX FSKAX/FZROX

Studies have shown that passive funds (with low fees) will beat actively managed funds (with typically higher fees) over time.  So, Bogleheads preach, pick an index fund and chill. 

&#x200B;

99,NCLH," Once again on cruise lines. Still not sure if I should sell my leap calls.

- Prices are trending down because of Delta worries.

- Probably Delta doesn't have an influence on actual cruises because the guests have to be vaccinated anyway and so far the vaccines seem to work almost as well for Delta. Unless they drop the ball on protocols and get their permissions revoked again.

- But stocks move more on sentiment than anything else.

So assuming we'll have another round of high case numbers from autumn to spring, which is likely due to the combination of a more infectious virus and governments worldwide letting go of almost all restrictions (when will we learn?) - Do you see cruise line shares drop further?

My gut feeling is that unless we get some good vaccination rate news to counteract the delta worries, it would be better to sell my NCLH calls now and maybe rebuy in winter. But you never know what happens and maybe I'm overlooking something.

PS: I bought the leaps before delta was a thing and probably should have sold when NCLH hit 33, or when Delta emerged in India, but hindsight is always 20/20.",don_cornichon,3,/r/investing/comments/oatbpi/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/h3kd439/,0.054,0.878,0.068,0.5775

105,AMC," Meme stocks drained me out….here is my advise to those who maybe planning to get into meme stocks

Hey there…I realised over 3.6k USD in losses from meme stock dabbling and FOMOing in general 

Just wanted to share about the mistakes I made to feel a little better about the hefty price I paid to learn.

I invested in AMC. 58 positions at 72….yeah the top. And I watched it all the while being desperate as it fell to 58. (This was the day they decided to add more stocks; they were warning about it prior apparently and I didn’t research properly aka ape analysis on WSB…so rip)

12*58 = -696 USD

I got desperate. Prior to that I had lost about 1.4K USD on stocks I did not understand at all…stocks which were soaring crazy for one day and crashed there after, like SLGG (-400USD) and ATOS/NEOS (-400USD estimated). I wanted to make it all back in one trade (MAJOR MISTAKE)

Threw it all into CLOV. Guess when…

@27 with around 30-40 positions 

The day opened, the stock crashed. Now I could have sold it but no, I hodl-ed 

It just kept crashing and I being the ape hodler I am bought the dip 

Averaged it down to 24 with 158 positions ….but the stock just tumbled and I bit the bullet when it was at 15


My lessons 
1) Investment should not be money that means a lot to you. I have come to terms with my losses now but honestly if I could go back; I rather not have lost that money. That feeling will be around forever 

2) Don’t invest in things you don’t get . Now I am no bio student and I didn’t even know what pharmaceuticals did until I threw my money in. Don’t get it; don’t put money in it.

3) Don’t blindly throw your money into soaring stocks. I think I can safely say that as a general rule of thumb don’t throw money into something that is surging a lot. SEARCH UP, find out why and only if you find it’s price is worth what it is, then buy.

4) Cut losses early. I watched my portfolio shrink rather than taking action to cut those losses. I gave into desperation and herd mentality. I hodled like an idiot. I sincerely regret it now but let’s face it, that ain’t gonna reverse what happened. Remember NO ONE cares more about your money more than you do so if you want to cut losses do so. You are obliged to no one in no manner for the financial decisions that you make.

5) Diversify. I was an idiot I to make it an all in decision in something as volatile as a meme stock. We all want to have some fun with all this lockdowns and pandemic related restrictions. So it’s still okay to invest in meme stocks but please put your fun money rather than actual money that means alot. Even if the stock is the next Amazon, you won’t know it till it happens so don’t all in on anything.

6) Don’t aim to recover. You will lose more. Aim to make money more on trades than you lose on trades. The idea of Recovering just brings unnecessary emotions that makes you make terrible decisions. 

It was painful. I couldn’t sleep for days and I felt really numb and paralysed on the day I bit those losses and told my loved ones about it . Thankfully, it’s money I could recover . Now I have started to joke about it with my friends, but that feeling at that point was hell and I sincerely  hope no one has to deal with that. I still do feel embarrassed sometimes to bring it up (haven’t told all my friends,too ashamed ) so some of those unpleasant feelings will last a lifetime.

So yea I hope my expensive lessons will act as a contrarian for your when your making highly risky decisions about investing in meme stocks (like that all in that I did )

Booster shots are a possibility if other variants  show up. That's why I haven't sold yet even though once a week I've entered all the info into the sell order and then backed out before hitting submit.

125,NTLA," ""they have a nobel prize winning product at hand""

Biotech is a very difficult sector to invest in and I don't have a background in healthcare. It's very much a sector where I invest in companies where I feel that - again, having no background - they have a compelling technology/platform where they can potentially go ""back to the well"" rather than requiring M & A to fill a pipeline. If a biotech with a cash cow starts to see that slow, hot can turn cold very quickly.

I did well with biotech last year but I realized that - while I felt strongly about some of the picks that I did make - I benefitted from massive inflows into the sector during a very risk on year and that those sorts of inflows weren't sustainable so a lot of those things were sold. When speculative growth tanked earlier this year, biotech - where many companies definitely aren't profitable - was certainly impacted.

And even in a risk on period like last year, I did keep some limit to biotech because while I may be fascinated with the innovations, again - I don't have a background in healthcare. With less devoted to more speculative growth this year, biotech still remains a % of my portfolio, but a very minor one where I'm comfortable with some speculation in situations where I want to participate but I'm not going to have huge positions without a healthcare background. The hope is that there is some degree of learn-through-investing about healthcare along the way.

""they have a nobel prize winning product at hand""

If you have a healthcare background and think that NTLA has a nobel-worthy product with what was just announced, great - would be great if the case but I'm not going to make those claims. I found it very interesting and it fits with the kind of biotech situations that I like and thought that I'd have an opportunity to add further at lower levels but (shrug.) 

"" If you look 5-10 years into the future""

Usually I'd say I don't like predicting 10 years into the future but lately even 5 seems a strain.

"" is it a good buy?""

Someone can have a long-term view on what they buy but where you buy still does definitely matter. I thought I was chasing a couple of days ago and was going to space out buys for what I thought would be a pullback and it kept going instead. Now up 100% or so and with a 91 RSI I have to think that it's certainly over-extended here.

127,AAPL," Equity means like stocks.  And right, all you have are equities, you might as well have only VTI pretty much as there are a lot of overlap between most of those funds if you look under the hood of them.

There are really only a few financial asset classes that are worthwhile and you can probably already think of them.  Stocks, bonds, gold, cryptocurrency.  You already got some equity exposure, maybe add VT (probably all you actually need for equity exposure) to get some international equity exposure.  Maybe add some TLT for some bond exposure, some IAU for gold exposure, and find some way to get some BTC exposure.  Also, in case the inflation thesis ends up bogus (which it probably is), keep some cash.

Though, Try to keep it simple still.  That said, I'm not a big fan of diversification myself (think of all the richest people you can think of, are they rich because of diversification?  More often than not, no), and I'm not a fan of the equity markets at these levels.  I am a fan of rebalancing (and having different assets to rebalance into), and if you have things that move with different correlations (or non correlation), it is much easier because markets are nearly impossible to time well which is I think the lesson of John C. Bogle, -just buy literally everything.

Currently I'm probably at .5% BTC (was shooting for 1%, it went against me for now), .1% gold, 5% treasuries, 10% equities, 84% cash (but I have an amount of cash I cannot afford to lose, and am in the camp that thinks risk assets will become increasingly as underpriced as they are overpriced now soon because of deflation caused by QE and low interest rates).

For the past 7 years I've been running something aggressive probably like  -1% cash, 50% equities, .5% gold, .5% treasuries, 50% BTC.  (basically borrowing against my gold and treasuries to load up on BTC and praying for inflation that has been unfortunately persistently lower than they hope \[but now the situation is why am I risking dollars at all ""to preserve purchasing power"" if inflation is like 1%?  that's only like -10k on 1million dollars /yr\]) and it's worked out well (though not everyone can get small tactical 0% interest loans to invest to keep a negative exposure to USD).  My best trade was a 2k investment in DOGE that went up 3,500% (not as much as I could have made by a lot but highlights the benefit of diversification, that one home run often will make up for whatever you could possibly have on the line), my best nominal trade was with BTC because of how much more exposure I had (though I would have probably done equally well had I kept my AAPL and ARKK positions, nice things if you like idiosyncratic risk which I am a fan of), so keep an open mind.

There also exists real estate, though I know nothing about that, because I always viewed it as basically a dividend play ultimately which I'm also not a fan of.  I think most people here go with O?

150,DTE," Where can I ask the following question? It's not allowed on the main r/investing forum, so I'd like to post it somewhere it is allowed. Thanks!

&#x200B;

I'm coming into a sum of money to invest and SPY is, effectively, my play as this is a longer term position. However, I am, personally, a little concerned about the current state of the market and, having ridden '00 and '08 to the bottom and back out, I would have been pretty pissed if I'd dropped a large sum right before the fall. I'm not looking to do a zero-cost collar, just insurance against a short term collapse from an external (\*delta variant\*) or internal (\*wsb moass\*) condition.  
  
I'm certain this isn't novel, but the terms I'm searching on are either coming up with generic options trading info or nothing. Certainly someone has written a paper or blog covering the various cost v risk v time for buying puts as a hedge - looking at strategies / optimizing DTE to minimize cost while avoiding a condition where you're staring at expiring options at the start of a downturn and you end up caught above your exp price but the IV is rising so quickly that rolling in more puts is cost prohibitive. I.e. - if you've got 10 lots of SPY, you buy 5 week expiration at (-risk%) on a 4 week rolling basis, or 4 week exp with 2 lots at a time so you always have 10 puts with expirations stepped out for 5 weeks, reducing IV costs at a slightly increased risk on 20% of your portfolio each week.

The thing is if you are going to invest in riskier bonds then you might as well invest in stocks. For me bonds should represent some form of safety in a portfolio. When stocks crash if bonds are to go up it will likely be safe havens like Treasures, Gilts, German Govt bonds etc that will benefit the most from any potential flight to safety.

If stocks are crashing then its likely due to some pretty bad economic outlook which in turn makes things like Corp bonds and Munis less appealing. 

The only bonds that look slightly appealing at the moment are short term govt bonds as they are most reactive to rising rates and inflation protected bonds like TIPS.

179,CLSK," Those types of stocks have super low premium though.  The best way to sell covered calls in my opinion is on the most volatile stocks, but only after they have had a big run up.  The premium on a volatile stock up big will easily outweigh weeklies, which you will either get nothing for or get exercised on when it pops and mute your ceiling.

I've sold hundreds if not a thousand covered calls in the last year alone, mostly on MVIS, SPCE, and CLSK, and have never yet been exercised.  At the same time, I would love for it to happen because that means the stock truly exploded and is almost certainly overvalued.  Some of my SPCE CCs were ITM recently, but have since fallen out.  I wait until the stock is up 100% or more in a short period of time and then sell them way OTM.

As an example, when MVIS ran up 300% to $24 in a couple weeks back in February, I was getting $1k premium for 2023 $35 calls, more than double my average cost.  I've gotten $800 for $42 strikes at the same date.  Got a few hundred for a month out.  On the recent run-up with SPCE, I got $400 for $55 July 30 strikes and then $300 for $80 strikes at the same date.  If the price of the option sinks below half of my premium, I will start buying them back in stages.

You need to have long-term conviction in a volatile and speculative stock though, and also be content with selling at your chosen strike price and date.  These two points are crucial.

182,LEAP," Ah, fair enough yes that's my fault.  I am not doing PMCC.  I just saw your comment about doing CCs on non-volatile stocks and sort of forgot what the OP was about.  I am very long in all the stocks I mentioned.

If you are buying a LEAP to sell them off of then it's definitely harder.  You can still get juicy premiums on week/month expirations when it jumps, but they may not be frequent enough for it to be worth it Idk.  With doing longer dates out, I don't have to worry about the frequency that the price pops, because it is likely to happen at some point and I can capitalize on that premium for months or years out in that one event.

I'm not a fan of swing trading, because that requires you are comfortable selling shares at the current price, which is usually difficult.  But with OTM CCs, you're comfortable at selling well above the current price in a situation where you likely won't have to sell at all and can just collect premium on top of a long position.",stippleworth,2,/r/investing/comments/ob2v3i/poor_mans_covered_call_question/h3lv4r5/,0.047,0.814,0.139,0.9532

186,ATH," >""Buy frequently and regularly as the market drops” is not quantitative enough to do a serious backtest.Nor is your example of buying 20% at 3.5% down from ATH, then all in ATH 3% down from ATH.

You're right. To be fair, the backtest should probably be as simple and quantitative as possible:

Buy using 10% of the cash each week for 10 weeks regardless of price. Buy using 100% of remaining cash if we hit 3% down from ATH.



>So you buy stock at 5% down from ATH, then some more at 10% down, then use up your last cash at 15% down. Does the stock have to get all the way back up to ATH before you will consider selling it. Or do you sell once it comes up a ""bit"" to a new ""high"". 

Great question. I invest almost exclusively in indexes, and I too am making the assumption that ""the market always recovers"". That means yes, I'd wait for a new ATH before implementing the strategy again. I'm assuming a serious correction or bear market is followed by months/years of rise.


>Let's say it recovers all the way to 5% down from the ATH and then starts dropping again. Do you execute any sells? Or are you still waiting for the stock to make a new all time high?

Yes, I'd wait for the index to reach new ATH again. Maybe even previous ATH+5% could act as a deadband.

Yes, exactly. That would leave you around 1% worse off than if you had done nothing. 


>Also you couldnt have more shares than the avg daily volume for a stock or you will have trouble getting orders filled at specific prices. 

I invest almost exclusively in ETFs with huge daily volumes. Unless you're a billionaire liquidating your entire portfolio, this shouldn't be an issue. I also specified:

""For this reason I would not recommend this strategy for individual stocks.""

That being said, if you try this with $MSFT, it shouldn't be a problem.

190,TDF," >Is this fund somewhat similar to Vanguards VTSAX for example?

Pretty much a much better version in terms of fee.

401(K) tends to have funds that aren't available for the average investor in the public fund market.

Companies like State Street, Fidelity, Vanguard, etc. know if they can make their funds show up in a company's 401(K) system, then they can make a lot of money pretty much risk free. Hence, 401(K) systems generally have 'institutional' versions of funds. These funds tend to have much lower expense ratios than the funds available in the public markets.

For instance, the target date index funds listed on the 401(K) at my company have fees of 0.025%. The lowest fee target date index funds you will find in the public market for most investors is Schwab's TDF at 0.08%.

You get the idea. Company 401(K) has much bigger money than your own brokerage account so company 401(K) systems can get much better deals.
