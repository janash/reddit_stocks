3,API," Hey guys,

It's u/nobjos back again with this week's post. I post a similar list every week.

Some FAQâ€™s:

How does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about the stock is positive or negative).  

Can I use the code/is it open source: [Yes](https://github.com/marketsentiment/mslive_public).

What is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here is the average across all the comments. Please note that if the number of mentions is lesser than 30, the sentiment value shown might not have statistical significance.

16,MRIN," It's been tough the last ~5 months or so. December through early Feb was an insane bull run, easy to feel invincible in those conditions if you don't have the experience or recognize the extreme detachment from fundamentals at the time. I sized down then eased back in as market dropped, mostly tread water for months by taking profits quicker on pops. Unfortunately that kept me on the sidelines for probably 99% of MRIN move after nailing the entry, but there had been barely any big runners previous to that (market wide, not just my watchlist,) so it's tough to immediately recognize when the cycle is changing. The odds have definitely been stacked against novice traders over this stretch. What worked in the winter definitely hasn't been working. In the same sense that my statistics from early last year stopped being applicable in December or so, and I had to adapt to take advantage.

Here's a very dense blog post on the subject - but it gives you a good idea of how much work it can take to be consistently successful through different cycles. This guy is a personal idol. Most furus don't give up much about their strategies; either they're trying to sell you something, or they figure it will reduce their edge. TradeTheMatrix1 goes the exact opposite way - he shares a ridiculous amount of information, knowing he needs to adapt dynamically with the market regardless of what he shares, and most people won't put in the work to follow in his footsteps anyway.

18,DD," I was actually thinking about this today.

I relatively new and not sure if itâ€™s beginners luck, but Iâ€™ve been doing a lot of YouTube research, DD on here and  Stocktwits, dd of the company itself.  This landed me to invest in DPLS, CYBL and FERN over the last 2 months or so. 

I mean these companyâ€™s literally tell you when and what they are going to do, like acquiring other companies, getting current, and etc.   and sure enough, it happens and these tickers have at least doubled, tripled, over the last 2 months if not more.

Because of the internet, social media and YouTube, I feel like the sharing, vetting, aggregation and flow of information is so much better than 10+ years ago.   So itâ€™s almost a no brainer for me to invest in companies where they or the CEO is outright telling you the playbook and following through with it?  

Maybe because I havenâ€™t been burned before and itâ€™s just a lucky streak.  One thing I have learned is that you need to be patient.",dxiao,9,/r/pennystocks/comments/oqykn6/i_may_not_have_the_best_choices/h6fqk8x/,0.036,0.854,0.11,0.9381
