""Low PE and PB multiples are not value investing.""  -- Buffett at 2019 Berkshire Hathaway Annual Meeting

For example, home builders and financials were all trading at single digit PEs in 2007. Lehman even had a 0.1 PB in Summer 2008. You think they were cheap? Lol.

On the other hand, Amazon had been bashed for years and years on this sub for being 'overvalued'. I vividly remember an 'expert' here giving me a lengthy lecture in late 2015 using all kinds of Ben Graham jargons, when it was trading at $600.

Buffett later bought about $1 billion AMZN in 2019 at around 1800.

16,NPV," The problem I have with this post and,similar ones is the author asserts that his thesis is to invest in undervalued companies by purchasing stock. There is no fundamental connection between the value of a company and the share price. The intrinsic value of a,company, in theory, is the net present value of the future cash flow of the company.

Obviously no one knows the future profits of a company or the appropriate interest rate to use to discount the cash flow to NPV. But even if you had a crystal ball and could arrive at a reasonable intrinsic value of the company, there is absolutely no reason to believe that the stock price will move in tandem with the intrinsic value of the company.

Stocks do not have intrinsic value, the price is totally driven by a minute by minute auction process. The price at any given time depends entirely on the bid environment, which varies with investor sentiment. Sentiment may be driven by news, a profit report, an opinion piece, social media, or a tweet. None of this has anything to do with the intrinsic value of the company.

Unless you are Warren Buffet and you are actually interested in buying the company, my position is that intrinsic value models provide no useful investment information.",MrFinnbo,1,/r/investing/comments/o93fz5/people_who_say_value_investing_is_dead_are_idiots/h38uehe/,0.045,0.798,0.157,0.977

37,NAV," Sorry if I'll go a little off topic here but... Expense ratios don't matter much as far as share/unit price of ETFs go. I suppose if the fee were really high, like say some silly number, 5%, the fund would have few buyers and that could theoretically drop the price well below NAV. But in reality funds will set up a reasonable expense ratio where the difference is hardly noticeable. Of all the things people can talk about when it comes to investing, expense ratios are one of the things that people wring their hands about, which actually matters the very least. It's like complaining that a company dares pay its utility bill. 

There really isn't NAV arbitrage with ETFs anyway. You see that much more with CEFs where people actually plan their trades around NAV premia or discounts. And CEFs have much higher expense ratios across the board, for different reasons.",ThemChecks,-2,/r/investing/comments/o8otkg/etf_expense_ratio_and_share_price/h37fx44/,0.049,0.884,0.067,0.4441
38,NAV," The short answer is that the fund deducts the fee from the assets under management. You never see this fee.

In theory, if an ETF's holdings never change in price, the NAV would go slowly down over time. Since the share price is effectively set to the NAV, that means the share price also goes down.

The mechanics don't matter to you as a retail investor. For you, the thing that matters is that the fee impacts your total return. If you have to funds A (expense ratio 0.1%) and B (expense ratio 1%) that both track the S&P 500 or whatever, then if the S&P's total return for the year is 8%, then fund A's return will be 7.1% and B's will be 7%.

Traditional brokerage account  
  
For simplicity, let's say I have a balance of $10K all in one index ETF for > 1 year that hasn't changed in value  
  
If I add $1,000 to that ETF this month, then pull $1,100 out 1 month later after the price goes up 10%, how does the IRS determine long vs short term capital gains on that $100 I made?   
  
It seems like they could go one of 2 ways: treat the $1,100 withdrawal as ""old"" money and tax the gain at long term rates, or the opposite.

53,IRS," You are talking about multiple scenarios, so I will answer your first question as best as possible...

If say you invested $10K in an ETF, held it for 1 year plus 1 day, and it had a gain of 10% at that time, you would have a ""LT Capital Gain"".

*For the Tax Year 2020*, the IRS says the following:

**Capital Gain Tax Rates**  
The tax rate on most net capital gain is no higher than 15% for most individuals. Some or all net capital gain may be taxed at 0% if your taxable income is less than $80,000.  
  
A capital gain rate of 15% applies if your taxable income is $80,000 or more but less than $441,450 for single; $496,600 for married filing jointly or qualifying widow(er); $469,050 for head of household, or $248,300 for married filing separately.  
  
However, a net capital gain tax rate of 20% applies to the extent that your taxable income exceeds the thresholds set for the 15% capital gain rate.  
  
There are a few other exceptions where capital gains may be taxed at rates greater than 20%:  
  
\>> The taxable part of a gain from selling section 1202 qualified small business stock is taxed at a maximum 28% rate.  
\>> Net capital gains from selling collectibles (such as coins or art) are taxed at a maximum 28% rate.  
\>> The portion of any unrecaptured section 1250 gain from selling section 1250 real property is taxed at a maximum 25% rate.  
Note: Net short-term capital gains are subject to taxation as ordinary income at graduated tax rates.

Link to [IRS.gov](https://IRS.gov) regarding LT Capital Gains:  *https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc409*

\*\*NOTE:  Joe Biden says he intends to INCREASE the LT Capital Gains rate for 2021 and beyond.  There is little concrete information on what the Democrats will propose here, so proceed with caution as they intend to make the tax date retroactive.",CheonsaGateun,3,/r/investing/comments/o8tgdv/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/h389v5l/,0.005,0.833,0.162,0.9946

My objective right now is to buy a home in about 5 years with my girlfriend, who just graduated and is now making about $100k.  She currently has none invested, with only about $10k in savings, while I have $8k invested (8 shares NVDA, 4 shares MSFT, 5 shares TSM, 4 shares AMD) and $5k in savings.  Neither of us have any debt.

A lot of people are telling me to start saving for retirement, and while I understand that, I have absolutely no intention of retiring ever.  This is the kind of job I'd do for free.  I'm a NASA employee, so I have the federal government's TSP for retirement savings, and they match up to 5%, so im maxing that out...  but after that, I FEEL as though I shouldn't put anything extra into a retirement account right now, when my main goal is in the short term (~5 years) of buying a home.

This is where hedge funds move large amounts of money between different stock sectors like recovery & tech over time (every 4-6 months or so) to beat inflation. A lot of tech penny stocks were inflated by hedge funds around February, some increased up to 300%+ to new ATHs.. Then they sold off for a few months as the hedge funds bought the DOW. Now the hedge fund money seems to be going back into NASDAQ tech penny stocks again... Is it true? Will the tech penny stocks rise again like Feb..?

Is it worth looking at this for short term perspective or long term play. Could there be an opportunity for stock Splits etc... Some pros and cons. 
I understand thats its pre revenue at the moment and hasn't committed to delivery timelines. Plus all the hassle of figuring out mfc logistics and projections can vary wildly. 
My readings on the subject says its got a solid management and talent pool and big money from middle east is invested so short-term money problems would be covered. 

Amazon and Tesla at one point were also pre-revenue but people believed in their vision and management. Big factors were both were first time to market and Lucid has major competition even from mainstream car makers.

You also say that you make 70-80k just working part time which means your income would probably be like 200-250k a year before taxes.  That means that you live in a vastly different world than the majority of humanity and can buy your way into most places and situations.

If I were you I would start a small Investment account at least.  If you don't have any money in the market then you won't be looking at or paying attention to the market at all.  Of course if the amount that you invest is so low that it doesn't matter to you then you won't look at it and it won't matter.  The purpose should be to gain knowledge over time so that by the time you are ready to invest seriously you don't have to rely on other people to tell you what to think.

I would probably pay attention to the price of housing wherever it is that you want to live and base when to purchase the home off of market conditions instead of some arbitrary amount of time.  The cost of houses has dramatically increased in the past year or so.  Who knows where it will be in 5 years  I don't think it is the best choice to force your way into a home unless you don't care about money at all.  Which if that is the case, then more power to you.

It might be worth buying a house once you get 20% down payment just to lock in a good mortgage.  If you don't overdo it you should be able to pay it off quickly anyways.

There is a chance you will get tired of your job at some point, or your GF gets pregnant and cant work so I would factor that in.  Also she could leave you.  Unless you are sure you are gonna end up with her (and have had that conversation) I wouldn't plan my life around her nor depend on her income.",DiamondHandsTendie,1,/r/investing/comments/o8tfrf/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/h38ouyx/,0.042,0.867,0.09,0.9606

75,MLM," I don't think this sub is kind to Beachbody because of the MLM segment of their business. That being said, I believe their nutritional products are available to buy directly from the company and you don't have to go through a ""coach"". 

I bought some frx because I know so many people who are loyal to Beachbody products and am told that everything else pales in comparison when it comes to the quality and production of the workouts they offer.

I think it will go up because of name recognition alone. Everyone I know in their 20s and 30s knows the brand Beachbody.",tbonecoco,3,/r/investing/comments/o8zplo/frxbody_on_monday_morning/h385u7z/,0.05,0.888,0.063,0.3328

77,MLM," MLM is reason enough for me to stay away, that ""leg"" of their business is shady and to me shows they don't believe in their products. As for their notoriety as a brand I've only ever heard about it here and I'm a gym rat since 2 years back...



Then again maybe their target audience isn't people actually going to the gym, rather the ones trying to get ""fit at home"" with dvds and apps. Either that or it's a regional thing...if so they could be undervalued if they manage to sell their concept to more people.",KyivComrade,1,/r/investing/comments/o8zplo/frxbody_on_monday_morning/h390pz4/,0.032,0.942,0.026,-0.1613
78,PM," Dividend stocks are great, but if you are young focus on growth instead.

The only time I buy dividend stocks is when there is a massive correction.  I lerned this as a young investor who thought divs were awesome, bought tons of PM, and underperformed the market for 5 years.  

Like I bought BASF last year at a 6% yield.  BASF grows their div yearly and the company is solid.  Other than that I try growth companies, but given the average index return is 7% a year, buying solid companies at >5% divs during corrections is low risk.",thorium43,1,/r/investing/comments/o8kdht/dividend_sotcks_vs_index_funds_what_are_in_your/h38bscv/,0.049,0.745,0.205,0.9497
