28,CC," Honestly that sounds like interests with extra steps. Sure there is no interest but what do those late payment fee annualize to? Do the same shark loaning regulations apply when you disguise interest as late payment fee? Given the lack of credit verification you brought up it sounds like it's going to be even easier for people to get stuck in an endless cycle of toxic debt and predatory fees. I'd have to read further in fairness, but that's how this looks to me and the fact SQ is paying 25% of its market cap for an acquisition speaks to the potential they see.

**Edit**: Yeah the fees are gross and go way fucking past shark loans when you annualize it (if they apply their max) :

>There are no fees when you pay on time. And late fees are capped at 25% of the purchase price.

25% over for being late on a 6 weeks payment plan. You apparently can't pile on more debt until its repaid but that ROI is absolute fire for the shark loaner. Especially if the target demographic is those with credit score so shit they can't use a CC.

**Re-edit**: It seems the fee is 10$ for a late payment, +7$ every subsequent 7 days on while late payments are not in. Not sure if the 7$ adds up per instalment (say you miss 2nd and 3d payment, are you getting charged 7 or 14?) and adds up to 25%. If I'm doing this math right and the 7$ don't stack, it seems this is this model of this ""interest-free"" & 0-benefit credit card wannabe (please correct me if I am wrong) :

Borrow ""$500"" and immediately pay the first quarter, so in effect you are borrowing $375 but they can charge up to 25% of the $500 (not gonna lie that seems pretty smart for the lender, they can even get on a high horse and pretend it's about instilling ""payment discipline""). In two weeks you are due $125 but start missing payments because you suck with money. There goes your first $10 fee and thereafter $7 every week. Within 18 weeks (rounded up) you have racked up your $125 of late fees, they can't add more fees but you of course still owe the money and have signed an agreement they will sue you for it if you try to dodge 'em. $125 of late fees over 18 weeks on $375 borrowed is 33.3% interest, annualizes to 96% with dumb math.

61,SQ," SQ was actually the first company that I ever purchased directly, back when it was $14. It definitely gave me an unrealistic view of investing, but I threw $450 at it because I loved the company so much and that was what I could afford at the time.

At the time, between my wife and I, we had 4 different active Square accounts for various projects and businesses, each with very different applications, and the service was amazingly easy to use and useful. 

I was running a retail grocery store, and we set Square up as a backup payment provider to our primary provider. When payment processing went down (which happened way to often), instead of panicking, our cashiers would grab an iPhone from the office and take care of customers quickly. I ran a small retail shop, and Square was our sole POS provider, and it was incredibly easy to set up. $500 worth of equipment and a couple of afternoons entering inventory, and we had a fully operable POS setup. I used it as a payment processor for fundraising events for a non-profit, and we did ticketing, bar, donations and everything with Square, and I could be running reports on how well the event went in real time, rather than running around counting cash at the end of the night like how it used to be.

I never had any dealings with their customer support because everything always just worked and I never had any trouble, and the costs were so reasonable for what they provided.

I have no experience with their consumer-facing products, but I love how easily their business-facing products work for small businesses.",barfplanet,5,/r/stocks/comments/owbabj/when_will_square_nyse_sq_be_added_to_the_sp_500/h7gtza8/,0.022,0.807,0.17,0.9929

2. Create 6 month to 1 year focused career training programs that heavily leverage technology to maximize the dispersion of on-the-job experience
3. Make these re-training programs free or tax advantaged, and make state and federal HR managers hire from these pools proportionally.

My prediction is that once the pilot plant is running and if results are good, then we'll start to see ABML performing confidently upwards; and maybe eventually it'll start running like SLI (Standard Lithium) is currently performing.

It all depends on their margins, at 10 percent profitability, its like 10 percent stock growth per year. 20 percent profit is 40 percent stock growth per year. i use a 50 pe ratio assuming they grow according to their projections/ goal of 50 percent per year production/deliveries. So 35,000 of revenue per vehicle x 6,000,000 production in 2026 equals 210 billion revenue for the year. multiply that number by your profit margin so say 15 percent is 31.5 billion profit. x50 earnings multiplier is around 1.5 trillion market cap 2026. so like 25 percent stock growth per year using those numbers.

172,DFS," I'll start with my thoughts. I think the market is too crowded and 100% legalization is not going to happen in the near future. 

Because of the crowded market they will continue to burn money marketing in an attempt to grow their userbase. I'd be curious to see the growth outside of the new legal markets, because I'd anticipate that it's lower than one would expect. Gamblers are not loyal to products they will bounce around based on promos and lines. 

On top of that their offering just isn't great, outside of the DFS business. The lines are not the best in the industry. They repeatedly get bad press from people in the industry who have their bets limited or out right refused. They have limited things (both games/events and props) that they offer lines on and the props they do offer are often gimmicky where the market has moved towards a more refined player/game prop market. The in-game wagering leaves much to be desired. 

Sportsbetting and DFS are small margin businesses with well established competition and almost no brand loyalty in my opinion. I just don't see a moat and once the novelty of the initial legalization wears off the growth will stagnate and you'll be stuck with small margins and a capped userbase. 

OTOH: DK does do things well, the actual experience is quite good relative to their competition. If they can develop brand loyalty I think there are potentials in things like in-game/at-game wagering. If they can refine the sports betting offering and avoid the negative press they are going to/already have been getting from established sports bettors about limits/wager acceptance etc I think there's higher margins to be had if they can innovate. 

While I don't believe 100% legalization will happen anytime soon (NV, and states like MN will be hold outs for sports betting), there are still big markets that are untapped as of yet. This includes states where the DFS offering is already legal which should ease marketing spending. 

Innovation and new offerings can increase revenue streams. The company has shown an eagerness and proven execution of continually growing the portfolio of revenue. I'm sure they have more ideas in the box, whether or not they're cost-effective to implement may be the question. 

The stock price is not tied to fundamentals and I doubt it ever will be. For DK this is probably a good thing as new regions begin to allow bookmaking it will trigger buying regardless of whether it's warranted and I think there's a real possibility it could outpace any sort of selling based on fundamentals.",RaisingQQ77preFlop,1,/r/stocks/comments/ow7dr6/the_bull_case_for_dkng_ahead_of_earnings_on/h7g6hlb/,0.07,0.808,0.123,0.9658

Innovation and new offerings can increase revenue streams. The company has shown an eagerness and proven execution of continually growing the portfolio of revenue. I'm sure they have more ideas in the box, whether or not they're cost-effective to implement may be the question. 

The stock price is not tied to fundamentals and I doubt it ever will be.

187,NYC," As someone who messes around in Sports Gambling and occasionally listens to podcast/ youtube shows, I dont think it is as big of a deal as you think.  If you participate in sports gambling, you know about Draftkings. 

When you decide what platform you want to use, youre going to care more about the lines, promos, and any boost. Draftkings also has a nice app and does a lot of free money boost which makes me check them daily even if I dont bet.

I am investing in Draftkings. I think it will go up as California, Texas, and NYC (1/3 of the population) will open up in the near future.  

A tip, if you can handle sports betting, many of these books give away free money around playoff time/ beginning of a season. For instance, bet $25 that LeBron will score 5 points. They do this pretty often and its usually an easy lock. Any money I make from sports betting I buy Draftkings with.

That said, if you would have asked me ten years which two companies were prime for devasting disruption, it would have been MA/V.

For decades their purpose was to provide a secure private network for transactions.  The critical mass global connectivity (internet) combined with adequate encryption security was achieved at least 10 years ago, making what MA/V does redundant.  Add to that the fact that their fees are insanely highly and that 100% of their customers (merchants) hate them.

Should have been a no brainer for someone like Google.  They should have been able to kill that old world almost overnight, the way Gmail slaughtered the whole concept of $20/month email accounts.

There was once a time where having a secure network with points of presence in every store, restaurant, airport, hotel on earth was a magical thing, and being able to send a data request on that network and get a guaranteed sub-second answer back was amazing, and crucial.  

But once the Internet was installed in all those places, and it became quick enough,  and the messages could be protected with encryption, The MasterCard/visa/Europay network was no longer the only game in town.  

There's a bit more to it of course, like the parallel financial accounts and settlement flows that go with it, and the way MA/V takes care of things like having a sort of a people's court for disputes and how they fund ongoing R&D for things like tap to pay and chip cards.

332,MA," > I think you’re also failing to mention one very big hurdle too. If someone steals my credit card, the bank will likely reverse the charge (sorry merchants) and I’ll be issued a new card number. 

No, actually those mechanisms are part of the network, and would not be funded by the merchant side but by the issuer/credit card company.  

It's because their private network solution promises security, a rapid way of determining if a card has been reported stolen or has other indicators of fraud.  

And they didn't do that out of the goodness of their hearts, they did it to avoid/placate regulation.  And it's a responsibility they're actively trying to shed right now.  They're trying to build the business and social case that if the cards and network are ""secure"" then any breaches must be someone else's fault.  Someone else meaning the store, for being dumb enough to accept it.  Or the consumer, for not being careful enough with their card.  It's a huge part of their justification for having a little microchip on the card.

> Similarly, if I lose my card, they just mail me a new one.

No, they don't.  Their customer, the issuing bank does.  And the choice whether or not to charge you for that is up to the issuing bank, not MA/V.  At the current moment, many do not, because of competition.  But for years prior, they did charge for that, and they certainly could again.

Ditch the first part. Screw the 24h chart, or the 5d. The 1y is where it starts to matter —and that’s in the context of you 1y from now thinking back to this thread.

“…seems to be a company to keep growing” says it all. Forget you own it, or at least forget the sell button even exists. Whatever it takes to hold for the long term.

If you want to know how to figure out when to sell, then look at their investor relations page and listen to earnings reports. When you lose faith in their leadership or future, then that’s when it’s time.

>	I keep seeing posts to take gains when you can so that is along the lines I’m thinking.

Fuck that.

If you want to make portfolio management a part-time job, then fine. Otherwise, you just said you have faith in the holdings, right? So let the companies prove themselves over the coming months and years.

You bought a small piece of ownership in the companies. If you have to take profits of 20 or 50 or 100 or whatever percent you’re up in order to benefit, that seems to suggest you don’t have faith in the holdings at all.

This may sound harsh, but I’m saying this because I can tell you have potential. It’s one thing to gamble or try to swing trade — but that should be a side gig that involves a small amount of spare time and some pocket change. You should focus instead on building your core portfolio.

Go to ETF.com and focus this energy on finding a couple funds that excite you. Ones that cover sectors that you have faith in, ones that you have selected out of the list because it strikes you as being the right choice. There’s a whole lot more out there than SPY and VOO, and you’ll be able to feel a sense of accomplishment in choosing your next investment.

415,DOCN," Think of DOCN as sort of a boutique cloud provider. It's very focused on being developer centric at a lower cost than the more enterprise offerings. They began as a service offering virtual machines (Droplets - is their name) as a service and have begun expanding into more of an overall cloud resourcing company. 

I personally have had nothing but good experiences with them from a service perspective. I haven't used all of their offerings but they are well documented and again very focused on getting developers exactly what they need to get a solution live and (i assume) scalable. 

I have no opinion on their financials. I bought in shortly after the initial IPO but liquidated after the last run up as I was more focused on freeing up cash and didn't have a strong long term conviction on them. 

I think they've got a bit of work ahead of them in terms of user growth but they've been one of my favorites that I've interacted with to just get little POCs and hobby projects live.

431,CAN," Technical analysis is far less important than fundamental analysis.

Instead of deciphering charts, study a company’s products/services, their competitors, the industry at large, their growth rate, balance sheet, trailing PE, forward PE (if you have the expertise to determine one), and their previous earnings call transcripts/investor presentations.

If the fundamental analysis determines that the stock is a good investment, you CAN use technical analysis to determine your entry points, although this isn’t necessary. The only time I do anything remotely resembling technical analysis is if a stock I want to buy is in the middle of a sharp decline. I will (sometimes) wait for it to stop dropping before buying more, as it can be hard to “catch a falling knife.”",thats_your_name_dude,4,/r/stocks/comments/owm3db/noobie_question/h7h0pcw/,0.044,0.887,0.07,0.4779
432,TA," Technical analysis does help in determining the short-medium term direction of a stock price point. Most trading on the market is conducted by algos so TA is becoming a self fulfilling prophecy. For example lets say a stock price double tops, algos will sell because they expect price to drop and in doing so cause the price to drop. Having a good understanding of supports, resistance and channels is best place to get started.

Also notice, that I mentioned that TA is good for short to medium term trades. You need not rely on TA as heavily as fundamentals when doing long term investments. And typically long term investment is the best way to go. Time in the market is more important than timing the market.",Nightrise19,1,/r/stocks/comments/owm3db/noobie_question/h7gt09g/,0.03,0.793,0.177,0.9665

434,NIO," I do this because of FOMO without honest belief in the stock.

I.e. there's a stock that's hyped, but I don't really think it will perform up to the hype. But there's some chance it could. I'm not willing to build too much exposure to that stock. But it drives me crazy that others may hit a jackpot leaving me behind. So I just put a small amount in it. It won't bring me millions if I'm wrong and it goes up. I won't lose anything significant if I'm right and it's unlikely to succeed. But this allows me to stop wondering about that stock and just leave it as is focusing on more promising plays. I feel good in any scenario, however it ends eventually.

So it's a psychological trick I play with myself.

One example is NIO. I discovered this stock after it made a big run up. I kind of think this company has bright future. But I also feel it is already expensively valued. So I kept trying to predict its next price move consuming my energy and distracting myself from more important plays until I opened a small position and forgot it.",GiedriusSm,5,/r/stocks/comments/owk3db/why_do_some_people_maintain_a_small_nominal/h7giuvl/,0.089,0.73,0.18,0.9715
