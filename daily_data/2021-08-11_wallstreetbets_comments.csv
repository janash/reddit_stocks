100,BB," BB literally has nothing that they own that support their stock rising in any significant way. People are putting their faith in old-ass technology that they never heard of before and saying that it gives the company value.

Last time, people were touting QNX.

QNX isn't new. It's an old real-time operating system that never got any significant market penetration. The biggest players in the RTOS game have small-ass companies that make just enough to pay their engineers.

The big run-up here is a cloud computing platform for machine learning models for autonomous vehicles? The needs of autonomous vehicles have not been standardized. There is no company that can certify that their model is what an autonomous vehicle needs because that has not been established. Companies are developing that in-house, and going to a 3rd party solution deploying an old model that wasn't good enough to drive a car for a different company isn't going to change that.

137,SDC," A very important aspect you left out is that they are creating partnerships with Dental Offices & Orthos. Invisalign had sole patents with most Dental Offices & Orthos but they are now expiring and are not being renewed with Invisalign being the sole provider. In Q2 SDC gained 1,800 offices that will oversee the SDC process (unlike before where there wasn’t any professional supervision). That was a huge step for them and logistically makes SDC a competitor. I think in 3-5 years SDC will be the staple for minor/moderate cosmetic fixes for people who failed to wear a retainer after braces, or people with gaps that are easier to fix. Of course this could totally not happen, but given the model of the company and the new implementations they finally have some legs to stand on. 
SDC is definitely not a great company now, but they are overly attacked and I have to assume it’s by competing investors. 
I think SDC is primarily shorted bc of market sentiment, not because it’s actually a terrible company. There is just a good easy reason to short the stock. But given this it provides a perfect scenario to be squeezed.",midnihyt,6,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p2i4zd/a_beaten_down_dog_that_will_make_you_smile_sdc_dd/h8kh7ho/,0.078,0.786,0.136,0.8874

153,SDC," It's not just gum disease. There have been people who develop crossbites and general misalignments. I mean, just think about what is being done. Your teeth are physically shifting, which is going to affect your entire jaw. There's a reason Orthodontists/Dentists require the level of schooling they go through. So to bypass that entire process to just slap some aligners over your teeth is just begging for issues to develop down the road. 

 
I remember hearing about SDC last year after a few people were posting about it. Even back then there was a lot of bad press coming out about them and there still seems to be.

154,SDC, My question is how much do dentists believe that  it is truly a horrible product and how much of it is they are upset by the innovation?  Or maybe they have been trained and truly believe they are the only ones who are capable of offering this type of treatment.  Often when disruption happens (particularly in a medical area) the professionals go crazy but in the end the innovation wins and they capitulate to it.  I’ll be interested to watch what happens with SDC here.

At one point my tongue swelled up to the point of touching the top of my mouth and all of my teeth at the same time.   Talked to my dentist and they said stop using it immediately.   I ended up sending everything back for a full refund.  Horrible cheap product that can seriously mess up your mouth.

For years I looked at that and wondered why someone wouldn't do a direct to consumer product because for the vast majority of cases both models will work.

Where things get sticky is the final 5% of your treatment.  This is where people with previously jacked smiles suddenly need every little thing perfect.  That's where you need someone who knows what they are doing to help you.  BUT, if you are cool with 95% then I think you are fine with SDC.

I thought the same about many issues you would go see a doc about but in 2020 almost all my families appointments were tele health appointments.  Issues that once needed to be person to person were now done by email (pictures) or conversation.  Would this not be similar?  Business and treatments are always evolving why not this?

462,OI," From a short term technical perspective, Sofi seems like a bad play to me, way too much OI on calls above its current price exp Fri, and a large amount of OI on Puts just below its current price, wallstreet has every intention on making those calls and puts exp worthless.  Id be surprised to see Sofi hold anything above $16 on friday regardless of earnings numbers, after earnings with IV crush and charm for Fridays expiration, these positions will probably take a big L, obviously that doesnt negate long term holders reasons for buying, i just dont think its a good short term play.

Edit:  just for details in regards to options OI
Current OI for options expiring friday between 16.50 and 22 strike is 54,632 contracts.  This represents 5.4 mm shares, .68% of shares outstanding, float currently is 56.45 mm, so options exp fri represent 9.67% of float.

506,USA," Oshkosh won the contract and the usps said that only 10% would be EV (not hybrid, that has not been mentioned at all).

However, the democrats were very upset about this so there is now legislation and funding that is partly approved in the infrastructure bill that will fund and demand 90% EV.  This has broad support because of Biden’s recent proclamation that all government vehicles should be EV, and significant climate change policy making momentum at the federal level (in addition to local levels being high for a long time now).

Some detail on background of this is here:  https://www.trucks.com/2021/03/08/congress-electric-mail-trucks/

As for the workhorse case vs USA, yes this is happening.  However, i have been following it closely and it is almost certainly about to be dismissed over the next few days.  The judge may make this decision between now and the next week.  The arguments made be Workhorse are not valid and the case will be disqualified.  Workhorse did not follow the process that was necessary to exhaust procedural remedies and therefore has no legs to stand on.  They also were not rated as even #2 or #3 in the decision making methodology which yes takes into account ability to produce and deliver this quantity of vehicles.

523,MFA," TLDR: You need to figure out if your dividends pay more each month on both your personal loan and margin. (Spoiler: It Wont)

Ultra Gay Dividend Value Investor Here:
Be warned, this advice may be boring for Wallstreetbets.
Well u/legaladvantage, I don’t want to tell you what to do. But do the math. How much money can you make doing this for a year?
Take month one:
You have:
Interest on a Peronal Loan
Interest on Margin
You have no dividends.
Why? Because dividends take a month or two to kick in.
Now, a dividends stock like MFA does it quarterly, so technically it may be best to have three dividends stocks (AT&T 🤮) and, uhhh, another REIT, or NVIDIA.
The key is to distribute the dividends so you get some every month, you need this to pay back monthly interest.
Fast forward to month 2, and you have:
2 Months Of Personal Loan Interest
2 Months Of Margin
Maybe your first $3,300 of Dividends, which honestly I can tell you outside of maybe REITs, you won’t get much safely.

You need to figure out if your dividends pay more each month on both your personal loan and margin.

I would argue, probably no.
Lenders are greedy, and probably will charge you more than you will make per month on dividends.

Dividends are boring but also mean the company is not taking their profits and investing in company (i.e. AT&T 🤮 is trending downwards for the past 5 years yet pays dividends). 

Tesla, Google, and Amazon, however, wager you will make more money from just investing than you will make with dividends. Perhaps that’s even the case. Outside of buying REIT shares pennies on the dollar like I did in March 2020, I would argue the blue chip ones will outperform REITS and other dividends in the long run.

In addition, dividend stonks can actually halt dividends whenever the feel like it.

I got lucky with a house that appreciated about $200K but other than that no inheritance or other big sources of income or gifts besides a few $10-$20K bonuses here and there over two decades.

700,ARDS," I like T S O I alot. 

Here is my write up on T S O I: 

The good, the bad, and the ugly. Let me get the ugly and bad out of the way so the rest can focus on the good. The company's financials are a mess with high debt, low cash on hand, and over 2B shares issued. However, the monthly burn rate appears to be low. 

The company has authority to print up to 3.5B shares so further and significant dilution may come. If the company does not recieve government funding or a partnership or some other interested parties involved in funding in some sort of non-dilutive manner, dilution may come.

Now that the bad and ugly are out of the way let's focus on the good. The CEO is highly engaged with shareholders and quite communicative. He recently bought shares at 5.9 cents indicating he believes the share price is undervalued. 

Jadicell is the primary reason why this company is a compelling investment. In phase 2 trial of Jadicell, 24 patients in the ICU on ventilators participated. 12 patients received the Jadicell treatment and 12 received the placebo treatment. 8 out of 12 of the patients, receiving the placebo treatment, died. Meaning only 33% of those patients survived. In the treatment group 100% of patients under the age of 85 lived. 91% of patients over the age of 85 lived. This is truly an impressive outcome. Jadicell Is a stem cell treatment that reduces inflammation and heal scarring of lung tissue which is huge since a primary cause of death and covid-19 patients is acute respiratory distress syndrome. ARDS occurs when fluid builds up in your lungs due to covid-19 and do scar damage impacting the function of the lung. As fluid builds up and scar tissue also restricts oxygen capacity patients do not receive a sufficient amount of oxygen requiring increasing amounts to be delivered to them. Eventually the untreated scar damage and continual buildup of the fluid results in such a reduced lung capacity that no amount of oxygen being delivered will result in a sufficient amount being delivered to the body to avoid organ failure. Again I point to the very tiny survival rate and the placebo group of only 33%. 

Jadicell will likely get a buyout offer since it may also restore lung function for covid-19 survivors with lung damage and it can possibly be used to heal long function from other diseases and lifestyle choices. Jadicell Is a moonshot worth the taking based on its extremely positive face to results the company is seeking EUA based on its face to results and maybe granted it outside of the US due to the impressiveness of its phase to results and the tremendous surge of covid-19 patients that threaten to overwhelm hospital capacity in many nations. Only 12 drugs out of 100 make it to phase 3 and of those that make it only 6 successfully pass phase 3 so Jadicell has a tremendously high probability of doing just that. 

Anyone who is currently shorting the stock will get the rug pulled out from them very soon. Government funding or other funding will very likely be secured and a stellar phase three will make the stock rocket. Moreover it has come to my attention that T S O I has connections to Gilead through a company that Gilead acquired in 2017 called kite pharma. Kite's head of Cell Therapy was hired in 2021 and his name is Dr. Francesco Marincola. He is also on T S O I's Scientific Advisory Board. Connections matter and he may information to Gilead to sour an acquisition or partnership with T S O I. 

I am extremely bullish on T S O I  even though I acknowledge it has some technical issues. It has huge potential to be a Covid play, but also a play to heal ling damage from all manner of lung diseases and life style choices; such as smoking or vaping. Vaping lung damage in particular represents a future potential for T S O I as it is increasingly being used by non-smokers who do not realize that even non-tobacco vapes can and will cause severe damage to lungs over time. 

T S O I represents an ignored gold mine that just hit a mother lode and truly has the potential to create generational wealth with shares costing mere pennies.

It is my opinion that Jadicell is the company's main opportunity to not only survive, but thrive into a very high multi billion market cap. I say Jadicell or bust.

These genetic mutations (i.e., copying errors) can, among other changes to the virus, lead to alterations in the virus’ surface proteins or antigens. They are random and not, in any remote sense of the word, planned, so the virus can live longer. Because viruses mutate frequently, mutations can provide enough viral advantages that it can take hold and spread throughout a community.  Influenza is a typical example.

891,SDC," I hope people don't believe OP's words just because he claims to be a dentist.

I'm a seasoned general dentist working in an ortho heavy practice and have closely worked with SDC cases as well as Invisalign (and a few competitors, Clear Correct, OrthoFX) and here's my professional take.

First of all, I don't care about the SDC stock. Not 1 bit. My point here is to simply state that OP's opinion of SDC should be taken with a grain of salt. I mean, all the dentists *I've* known and worked with STILL dislike SDC. See? Anyone can just claim things like this (although I'm being honest here).

By the way, OP, how can you call yourself a dentist and be fine with SDC doing mild to moderate cases? Do you even understand basic orthodontics?

The idea of SDC is to move teeth without understanding the relationship of said teeth with the bone underneath. Have you seen the impression system they have their (untrained) users make? It doesn't grab anything 1-2mm apical to the gingival margin. Seriously? How do they tell which direction the roots are going? How are they seeing any anatomy below tissue? Invisalign/OrthoFX/Clear Correct all have real orthodontists on staff who alter cases, who often even request ceph tracings (xrays used specifically with braces cases). The 2 SDC ""docs"" I worked with were both lab technicians...Seriously?! There's a reason ortho is a 2-3 year specialty after dental school. It's not easy to master the relationship of bone to teeth.

SDC has been and will be a subpar treatment for clear braces. Period. Everything from the scanning (or impressions), to the planning, to the bracket placement and IPR adjustments, to the delivery is all under the supervision of a dentist. It's impossible that a person with no dental training can learn to take impressions without error. There's just too much room for error with SDC and you can really mess your gums/bone/teeth in the long run (Look up ortho related recession/bone loss).

They were temporarily banned in ""practicing"" in California for a reason. The CDA filed a lawsuit against them for negligent practice.

This is NOT the future of braces. It's NOT a sound alternative. It is NOT a cheaper alternative in that you're causing long term problems and still throwing a pretty penny at SDC.

In my opinion, as far as planning goes, orthofx and invisalign have both presented thorough treatment plans and considered all the requirements we had within the cases.

Again, the stock can do what it wants, but this is a shitty company purporting themselves as a legitimate dental ortho business. It's BELOW STANDARD OF CARE and ask any dentist that's not OP and 99/100 will agree with me.",montybeta,20,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p25fmg/smile_direct_club_sdc_honest_dd_by_a_dentist/h8i9ro9/,0.044,0.889,0.067,0.848

Check out CF workers. They are dirt cheap and way easier to debug/log than lambda@edge.

Edge compute also let us eliminate a bunch of really annoying stuff from client-side: localization, removing/adding content based on device type, ""tidying"" responses for APIs we don't control.

1041,FSD," I think TSLA is great and have a lot invested in there, but you are just ranting and spouting crazy talk.

FSD (e.g. Level 4) - will arrive when it arrives. Might be this year, might be in five years. Trying to time that is a bit pointless.

New gigafactories - while they will be great, especially once 4680 and chip production is sorted out, production this year from them will not be much. They are working on lots of new production technologies which will inevitably cause various interruptions and delays until they are all working smoothly and allow for mass production. Then as production technologies are validated there, they will eventually stop production in Fremont to update production lines. Meaning that we might not see significant production increases until 1rst or 2nd quarter of 2022 the earliest.

Blade Batteries/LFP - this is a huge unknown as to what that means  going forward and how it intersects with 4680 plans. A better understanding of what Telsa envisions as its future path and where these fit in, might be critical to understanding how profitable the energy side of things can be (including cost of batteries for vehicles).

Warren Redlich while he has some interesting stuff has said some crazy stuff such as suggesting in 5 or 10 years that Tesla should be valued as a multiple of sales.

Lackluster innovation - ok... making a pickup truck with a unibody, 4680 cells, moving to larger castings and eventually a unicast, if they can, self-driving endeavors, and so on is lackluster... Show me who is close.

NIO - has massive challenges ahead of it if they want to scale up production. The battery swapping is not a good candidate for scaling up production and in terms of building EV's, NIO is far behind Tesla in cost and range. It is not even close.

1055,FSD," Stop trying to compare actual delays like semi and CT to FSD, they are not related in anyway. A poor attempt to make your point seem half decent. 

Just look at how much better the newest version of FSD is when all they did was switch to vision only... it was expected to perform worse with vision only yet it is still the best public autonomous vehicle. If you understood NN at all you’d know all that is needed now is data, which Tesla is the only company able to collect at large scale, and it’s all free.

Presales - considering they have said in the past something about starting production in Sep and given all the issues they have had, who do you think is giving them money before they actually produce something? The whole ""fleet"" thesis rests on some claims about fleets being careful with how much they spend. Doubt giving money to a company with a going concern before the trucks are produced aligns with the idea of a fleet that is cost conscious. So let's be honest here, chances of presales is zero.

Production - As you noted Rivian and Tesla have both announced delays. But forget the truck segment and look at Lucid and Workhorse as well and it is clear that delays are endemic to this industry. Especially for a company that has not yet mass produced a vehicle, putting in place all the elements to produce a vehicle is a daunting process that invites delays. No idea if they announce delays now or later, but I think it is safe to assume delays are coming.

Short Interest - at 7/15 it stood at 31.88M shares. RIDE is facing insolvency and is actively trying to figure out how to raise funds, such as with the share offering via YA. Unfortunately for RIDE that offering only caused the share price to plummet which means it will not be close to enough cash. Operations will not be cash flow positive for a long-time (assuming they ever successfully produce the vehicle, itself a far from certain proposition) meaning that RIDE will not stop with cash raised once the YA offering is complete. The YA offering is over 35M shares, which is enough to fully cover the 7/15 short interest. Further Workhorse just sold a whole bunch of shares and we know Stephen Burns still owns 46.4M shares. If I am reading the lockup correct Mr. Burns can sell 50% of those shares (so 23.2M) sometime by the end of Oct 2021. So between YA and Mr. Burns we can expect about 58M shares to come on the market in the near future. Going back to the YA offering, since it is clearly not enough money at current share prices, there will be additional share offerings. Shorts do not seem to be in much danger here. Of course, if you start a movement to buy shares stupidly to boost the stock price to squeeze shorts, well in that case that would be manipulation, but I guess you can say you like the stock.

Beyond the issues above, which are not positives here, there is the simple reality that this company has not demonstrated a vehicle near ready to be sold. The SF250 had a heavily modified vehicle that averaged extremely low speeds. On their recent demo day they limited speeds to 40 mph (I think it was that... maybe it was 45 mph) and it was claimed that this was due to a limitation from their brake supplier. Per their response to the short report they admitted they changed the body panels and they said they needed to add weight, strengthen the frame, and do some extra work on the suspension due to the unsprung weight issues. Nevermind adding weight to an EV sounds like a terrible idea, but the promise of a simplified production via using in-wheel motors is countered by their own statements. Maybe their vehicles are the best thing since sliced bread, but they have yet to demonstrate them properly. Also, one has to wonder, can you just get rid of your key person who has overseen this development for years (going back to Workhorse) and expect to have someone else come in and meet his already ambitious timeline? It really seems a stretch. Angela does not have a good track record (her resume is a list of companies that failed while she was there. Not saying it was her fault, but she clearly did not pull off magic anyplace), so exactly which clown here is their savior?

Basically, if they can't convince people that their technology is viable and they can produce this truck the stock should fall well under $2 a share making fund-raising an impossibility and triggering management to distribute the remaining cash and to close up operations (or get bought out for cheap to do the same). If you net out of such a deal $1 per share count yourself lucky. Myself, I don't think they will convince people that they are worthy of being invested in, and I think they will continue to fall which will just pile on the misery as it becomes increasingly clear to hold outs that fund-raising is a non-starter (meaning insolvency is looming and the company is essentially worthless).

I have Puts at $5 on this, so feel free to dismiss my rantings as that of a mean manipulator working for the Hedge Funds. I guess you owning shares makes you more worthy of DD. Myself, when I first read about what RIDE was doing with in-wheel motors, I thought it was a brilliant idea. Before investing I made some effort to research into them and started learning about unsprung mass and rotational inertia and my doubts only grew. I did not start as a bear on RIDE, but everything I have seen from them since my first initial admiration has led me to having a bear thesis here.",aka0007,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p2a8aj/ride_or_die_breakoutshort_squeeze/h8itqz8/,0.061,0.783,0.156,0.9983
