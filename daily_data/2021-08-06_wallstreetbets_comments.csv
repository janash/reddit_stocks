160,VIAC," Goldman's Sacks just reiterated a BUY rating with $75 price target:

""ViacomCBS (Buy) reported 2Q21 results that beat expectations, with revenue, Adj. OIBDA and streaming subscribers all coming in ahead. Our key takeaway from the quarter is that VIAC is showing much more durable momentum with its flagship streaming service (Paramount+) than we had expected. For example, VIAC not only generated more net adds in 2Q (6.5mn) than its launch quarter in 1Q (6.0mn), it did this during a period when most other streaming services showed material deceleration. Further, based on the company’s upcoming market launches, robust slate of content and new distribution agreement with Sky, we see upside potential to our streaming subscriber and revenue estimates, which we have increased. While supporting this momentum will likely drive higher near-term content investment (thereby limiting growth in EBITDA and FCF), we believe investors are increasingly likely to recognize the long-term growth potential of VIAC’s rapidly growing streaming business.  
We therefore reiterate our Buy rating on VIAC with an unchanged 12-month price target of $75. See below for our key takeaways from the Q and details on our revised estimates.""",Chilly-Cheez,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oyx6tx/viac_god_tier_way_too_long_dd_all_aboard_the_p/h7ylg7z/,0.0,0.904,0.096,0.9423

EDIT: This blew up more than I thought it would. I've never posted DD here before but the overwhelmingly positive reaction I've received from this has inspired me to contribute more to the community. Now, initially I was going to make a separate Part 2 post but I don't want to be seen as spamming so I'm just going to put it as a comment and add it as an edit. Besides, it's probably important to have the risk factors of the trade as part of the original post.   
8. RISK FACTORS  
Alright everyone. Some of you read the whole thing and YOLOed. Some of you didn't read any of it and still YOLOed. Most of you probably didn't do shit. And that's ok, because I want everyone to read this next part first before deciding.   
\- The entire market could crash like the gay bears have been promising for months. This would of course take out everything with it, and VIAC is no different. The 10% Correction gets thrown out regularly, I'm not an economist so I really don't know if or when this is going to happen - although most of us will have way bigger problems than just VIAC if that does occur.   
\- The decline of linear TV outpaces the growth of streaming. This is the worst case scenario for Viacom: advertisers pull their dollars out of linear which has been a cash cow and reallocate them elsewhere (i.e. NOT streaming), leaving Viacom underfunded for P+ growth. I must acknolwedge the potential risk of this even though I assign a very low probability to this in the short term since Viacom just completed the best ad buying upfront they've ever had. That article is a good read because it's not just Viacom tooting its own horn, it's the entire industry! If anything it paints a fairly rosy picture of where the money is flowing.   
\-  The P+ app fails to gain traction. Paramount plus has seen two straight quarters of new user growth while Disney and Netflix have actually declined. However, it's certainly easier to gain new users when you're app is new. We don't know if something will keep growing at the rate it has. Reddit and Twitter do have their fair share of people bitching about the P+ app as far as content availability (some seasons of some shows are still licensed out to competitors and the short term) and bugs (the Playstation app is apparently abysmal while the other apps work much better - I've never had an issue on my Samsung or Fire apps). The bottom line is that while P+ has the same growing pains of any new app, the devs do need to figure their shit out, do their fucking job, and keep complaints at a minimum.   
\- Competition - The competitors in this space have DEEP pockets. All 5 FAANG names have some sort of video platform, Netflix is of course the leader here, and Apple and Amazon have at least made half assed attempts to be players in this space. A strategic shift from either Apple or Amazon to suddenly start pumping cash into these efforts could prove to be a threat for the survival of Viacom as a viable independent player. The silver lining here however is that should they choose to do that (Apple especially has done basically jack shit) - the easiest way to suddenly increase their position would actually be to buy Viacom's vast IP.    
\- Merger. But wait, wouldn't a merger be a good thing like you said earlier before? Not always, and unfortunately Discovery already laid a very recent, very relevant blueprint for why not all deals are good deals are shareholders. I've seen a similar deal pitched in which Comcast unloads NBC Universal onto Viacom in a reverse morris trust merger; I would expect that to do to our share price what the Warner deal did to Discovery's. If we are going to get acquired, it better be all cash or all stock, and at a valuation that reflects our true value. I think Shari Redstone is actually our friend on this, she won't screw us the same way Zaslav fisted his shareholders. Conversely, if Viacom suddenly decides they want to be a buyer rather than a seller, history dictates that it's the acquiree's share price that moons while the acquirer's share price that takes a hit. There's no guarantee that the long-established 38 price floor will hold in the event of strategic M&A. Given the ludicrous valuation Hello Sunshine just got, I would much rather be a seller than a buyer in this market.   
\- Dividend. In my infinite retardation I somehow managed to forget to mention this stock pays a fucking healthy dividend too, which is probably a factor as to why we have so much institutional ownership. A dividend cut of course would hurt the share price. I see the probability of this as basically near zero, the balance sheet looks pretty good right now.   
\- The Options Pinning Theory. A lot of people are claiming this stock only exists to kill weekly options, but on most weeks I don't see enough open interest for that to actually be worth it for MM's. One thing is certain though, all calls bought after Archegos expecting a bounce to the 80-100 range got nuked. Thus far, call selling has been a more profitable trade than call buying MOST of the time. While personally I think shares and leaps look like the play here (my position currently reflects that also), any time this thing dips below 40 is when to go in with FD's as it very rarely spends too much time below there. For the more conservative investor, SELLING 38 puts is literally free money.   
\- Archegos - Some say there is an Archegos curse, that nothing in the Korean hedge fund is ever going to moon again. I mean this is some voodoo shit but I feel like it has to be included here. The Chinese stocks he held are obviously down for entirely different reasons right now, and it just hasn't been a hot time for the value / comm trade, something I expect to reverse H2.   
\- The Growth Trade Never Fucking Ends. As most of us know the tech trade was basically left for dead earlier in the year as shares of tech stocks tumbled as the ten year yield started to rise up steadily. This trade has reversed, and all the money has since gone back into tech, particularly the megacaps. The growth trade has been at the expense of the value trade, and make no mistake about it, VIAC IS A VALUE TRADE (LOOK AT THE P/E). It's listed on the NASDAQ, but don't call this a tech stock, it's a communications stock. While it does look like the ten year yield has stopped drilling with today's nice bounce, there's no guarantee it doesn't once again reverse. However, I have a really difficult time seeing it going below 1%, and I'd be the whole house on the fact it ends the year closer to 2% than 1%. As the yield goes back up, they will shift the money from the growth trade back into value, which benefits VIAC.   
\- SPEAKING OF ALGOS - What does it mean to be heavily institutionally owned? Share price movements are more algo-induced from the big boys. They'll trade many stocks together simultaneously in the same industry, which at times can be unfortunate if you're grouped together with subar competitors. Layer a VIAC chart over DISCA between May and yesterday and you'll see what I mean, when one goes down so does the other. Today's price movement has been encouraging though, I have never seen VIAC green while DISCA is red I think ever. A decoupling here would be fantastic.   
\- The 38 Price Floor I believe in might not hold - for all the reasons I included above, shit could go south, but this floor has stood the test of time and all sorts of wild shit this year. If it can survive the greatest margin call in history, and every retest after that, then this 38 floor is safer than any other investment I can think of since I don't know the floors of any other stock. But something only works until it doesn't right? So I'm including this as a risk factor since much of the thesis is based upon it.   
\- TL/DR: There are risks to this trade as there are with any trade, and from the above it's wiser to go with a longer term trade in LEAPS form as much of this stuff takes longer to develop. I'd only go FD's if it dips below 40 as it doesn't spend much time below it. But when factoring in the growth potential, the safety of the 38 floor, the dividend, and the acquisition potential, this play really does have it all for me. Trade safely apes.",biggestapple,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oyx6tx/viac_god_tier_way_too_long_dd_all_aboard_the_p/h7yysn8/,0.069,0.767,0.164,0.9995

171,IP," PART 2 AS PROMISED (SORRY NO TA, I HAVE SHIT TO DO TODAY) - You can also read this as the edit on the original post, that one has some links)  
EDIT: This blew up more than I thought it would. I've never posted DD here before but the overwhelmingly positive reaction I've received from this has inspired me to contribute more to the community. Now, initially I was going to make a separate Part 2 post but I don't want to be seen as spamming so I'm just going to put it as a comment and add it as an edit. Besides, it's probably important to have the risk factors of the trade as part of the original post.   
8. RISK FACTORS  
Alright everyone. Some of you read the whole thing and YOLOed. Some of you didn't read any of it and still YOLOed. Most of you probably didn't do shit. And that's ok, because I want everyone to read this next part first before deciding.   
\- The entire market could crash like the gay bears have been promising for months. This would of course take out everything with it, and VIAC is no different. The 10% Correction gets thrown out regularly, I'm not an economist so I really don't know if or when this is going to happen - although most of us will have way bigger problems than just VIAC if that does occur.   
\- The decline of linear TV outpaces the growth of streaming. This is the worst case scenario for Viacom: advertisers pull their dollars out of linear which has been a cash cow and reallocate them elsewhere (i.e. NOT streaming), leaving Viacom underfunded for P+ growth. I must acknolwedge the potential risk of this even though I assign a very low probability to this in the short term since Viacom just completed the best ad buying upfront they've ever had. That article is a good read because it's not just Viacom tooting its own horn, it's the entire industry! If anything it paints a fairly rosy picture of where the money is flowing.   
\-  The P+ app fails to gain traction. Paramount plus has seen two straight quarters of new user growth while Disney and Netflix have actually declined. However, it's certainly easier to gain new users when you're app is new. We don't know if something will keep growing at the rate it has. Reddit and Twitter do have their fair share of people bitching about the P+ app as far as content availability (some seasons of some shows are still licensed out to competitors and the short term) and bugs (the Playstation app is apparently abysmal while the other apps work much better - I've never had an issue on my Samsung or Fire apps). The bottom line is that while P+ has the same growing pains of any new app, the devs do need to figure their shit out, do their fucking job, and keep complaints at a minimum.   
\- Competition - The competitors in this space have DEEP pockets. All 5 FAANG names have some sort of video platform, Netflix is of course the leader here, and Apple and Amazon have at least made half assed attempts to be players in this space. A strategic shift from either Apple or Amazon to suddenly start pumping cash into these efforts could prove to be a threat for the survival of Viacom as a viable independent player. The silver lining here however is that should they choose to do that (Apple especially has done basically jack shit) - the easiest way to suddenly increase their position would actually be to buy Viacom's vast IP.    
\- Merger. But wait, wouldn't a merger be a good thing like you said earlier before? Not always, and unfortunately Discovery already laid a very recent, very relevant blueprint for why not all deals are good deals are shareholders. I've seen a similar deal pitched in which Comcast unloads NBC Universal onto Viacom in a reverse morris trust merger; I would expect that to do to our share price what the Warner deal did to Discovery's. If we are going to get acquired, it better be all cash or all stock, and at a valuation that reflects our true value. I think Shari Redstone is actually our friend on this, she won't screw us the same way Zaslav fisted his shareholders. Conversely, if Viacom suddenly decides they want to be a buyer rather than a seller, history dictates that it's the acquiree's share price that moons while the acquirer's share price that takes a hit. There's no guarantee that the long-established 38 price floor will hold in the event of strategic M&A. Given the ludicrous valuation Hello Sunshine just got, I would much rather be a seller than a buyer in this market.   
\- Dividend. In my infinite retardation I somehow managed to forget to mention this stock pays a fucking healthy dividend too, which is probably a factor as to why we have so much institutional ownership. A dividend cut of course would hurt the share price. I see the probability of this as basically near zero, the balance sheet looks pretty good right now.   
\- The Options Pinning Theory. A lot of people are claiming this stock only exists to kill weekly options, but on most weeks I don't see enough open interest for that to actually be worth it for MM's. One thing is certain though, all calls bought after Archegos expecting a bounce to the 80-100 range got nuked. Thus far, call selling has been a more profitable trade than call buying MOST of the time. While personally I think shares and leaps look like the play here (my position currently reflects that also), any time this thing dips below 40 is when to go in with FD's as it very rarely spends too much time below there. For the more conservative investor, SELLING 38 puts is literally free money.   
\- Archegos - Some say there is an Archegos curse, that nothing in the Korean hedge fund is ever going to moon again. I mean this is some voodoo shit but I feel like it has to be included here. The Chinese stocks he held are obviously down for entirely different reasons right now, and it just hasn't been a hot time for the value / comm trade, something I expect to reverse H2.   
\- The Growth Trade Never Fucking Ends. As most of us know the tech trade was basically left for dead earlier in the year as shares of tech stocks tumbled as the ten year yield started to rise up steadily. This trade has reversed, and all the money has since gone back into tech, particularly the megacaps. The growth trade has been at the expense of the value trade, and make no mistake about it, VIAC IS A VALUE TRADE (LOOK AT THE P/E). It's listed on the NASDAQ, but don't call this a tech stock, it's a communications stock. While it does look like the ten year yield has stopped drilling with today's nice bounce, there's no guarantee it doesn't once again reverse. However, I have a really difficult time seeing it going below 1%, and I'd be the whole house on the fact it ends the year closer to 2% than 1%. As the yield goes back up, they will shift the money from the growth trade back into value, which benefits VIAC.   
\- SPEAKING OF ALGOS - What does it mean to be heavily institutionally owned? Share price movements are more algo-induced from the big boys. They'll trade many stocks together simultaneously in the same industry, which at times can be unfortunate if you're grouped together with subar competitors. Layer a VIAC chart over DISCA between May and yesterday and you'll see what I mean, when one goes down so does the other. Today's price movement has been encouraging though, I have never seen VIAC green while DISCA is red I think ever. A decoupling here would be fantastic.

Thanks so much. I hope that you make a lot of money on this trade. You throughly deserve it.

I agree with the bull case and the risk factors. I am particularly concerned about these risks: 

1. Bad M & A (Shari Redstone please don't fuck us).

2. Algos fucking VIAC everytime there's positive movement. 

3. Is the large institutional ownership almost detrimental to upwards price action?

From a fundamental perspective, as grossly undervalued as this is right now at 9 P/E, if it sinks further buyers are going to come in looking for value. In addition, As the ten year yield rises H2 2021 I do think we see a transition from growth stocks to value - then again I don’t know shit about fuck.

413,MVST," MVST is now at almost 2 million trade volume premarket, when average daily is 1.1 million. That means bigger groups are picking up on this stock, which is extra exciting. It is up almost 15% premarket. The $10 strike got slapped around yesterday, and it popped right up to $12.5 -- there are approximately 20,000 open contracts at that strike. That is 2 million shares which need to be rehedged with this crazy popping -- the next strike is $15 which has around 30,000 open contracts. If it can hold above $12 this morning, it may get spicey this afternoon.",vixhound,30,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oz57p6/daily_popular_tickers_thread_for_august_06_2021/h7xiie1/,0.069,0.879,0.052,0.0387

416,AMC," I get it that the sentiment is against AMC guys.  Allow me a moment of your time to change your mind.

Can a case be made that it's a garbage company that's headed for bankruptcy?  Yes. 

Is the senior leadership team a bunch of carnies in suits that talk out of both sides of their mouths?  Most likely. 

Is the AMC-dedicated subreddit one of the most cringe-inducing corners of the internet?  Absolutely.

But here's the thing: I have quite a few shares and I want to sell them for significantly more than the current share price. So can we prop it up one more time for old Bilbo?

742,AMC," OP's TA looks solid. I've swung this one since January and I agree, it's going back to the teens, maybe higher if Ocugen begins manufacturing (They are setting up to right now in the Northwest US.)

I follow the global vaccine news (because of OCGN). This stock has moved big on news twice before. There are major catalysts coming this month.

A couple of qualities Covaxin has that mRNA vaccines do not:

* It does not need as much refrigeration so is cheaper to distrubute especially in warm climates.
* Proven safety for children under 12.
* Clinical trials in a controlled environment on Delta variant with proven efficacy.
* Inactivated virus vaccines have been used since polio vaccine. There's a certain segment of the Antivax crowd that feel these vaccine is more palpable than mRNA vaccine.

Like it or not, I believe a short squeeze is immanent. 190M float with 50M known shares sold short, and 30M owned by institutions. The stock has been hugely popular with retail outside of WSB. Top 5 on Webull and Stocktwits today. 17K in OCGN subreddit. Its average daily volume is around 40M but it has been trading around 10M during the two weeks before current run up. I believe this is the type of lemon like AMC or GME, except with this one speculative profits are not magic-internet video game's played in a movie theatre on the moon.

* WHO Approval likely after [Aug 15](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/videos/news/indias-covaxin-to-receive-who-approval-soon/videoshow/85077153.cms).
* Canadian EUA in the works.
* Trials on Children in US.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

A couple of qualities Covaxin has that mRNA vaccines do not:

* It does not need as much refrigeration so is cheaper to distrubute especially in warm climates.
* Proven safety for children under 12.
* Clinical trials in a controlled environment on Delta variant with proven efficacy.
* Inactivated virus vaccines have been used since polio vaccine. There's a certain segment of the Antivax crowd that feel these vaccine is more palpable than mRNA vaccine.

Like it or not, I believe a short squeeze is immanent. 190M float with 50M known shares sold short, and 30M owned by institutions. The stock has been hugely popular with retail outside of WSB. Top 5 on Webull and Stocktwits today. 17K in OCGN subreddit. Its average daily volume is around 40M but it has been trading around 10M during the two weeks before current run up. I believe this is the type of lemon like AMC or GME, except with this one speculative profits are not magic-internet video game's played in a movie theatre on the moon. It's a vaccine that has huge potential to save lives by inoculating children under 12 and all people in lower income areas or warmer climates. I'm buying all the calls i can afford.",RetardedHedgeFund,7,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oz1w1v/ocgn_has_a_lot_of_room_to_run/h7yng21/,0.01,0.859,0.132,0.9817
746,OCGN," I'm already onboard OCGN.

Strongly believe this is the vaccine everyone will need, even when you are fully vaccinated. Taking a booster shot of the same vaccine that is already proven to be ineffective to the highly contagious Delta variant is simply silly. Here we have a vaccine that's proven to be effective against the Delta variant but news and information about it is being suppressed by the big pharma players. These big pharma players are not concern about lives, they are just interested in lining their own pockets. How else do you explain them urging governments that a 3rd booster jab is needed while at the same time increasing the price of their vaccines?",too-busy-to-game,4,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oz1w1v/ocgn_has_a_lot_of_room_to_run/h7wzgfr/,0.026,0.904,0.07,0.6253

785,HOOD," just an fyi from my trading account news:

>The prospectus relates to the offer and sale from time to time of up to 97.9M Class A common shares by holders. HOOD is not selling any Class A common shares related to the resale and will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of shares of Class A common stock by the selling stockholders.  HOOD is offering 97.9M shares of Class A common stock issued to the selling stockholders upon the automatic conversion of Tranche I convertible notes held by the selling stockholders in connection with HOOD's initial public offering. The convertible notes were issued in a prior private placement transaction prior to HOOD's IPO.

the shares are already counted in full dilution already listed.  This is just conversion from debt to equity and sold from private stakeholders onto the market.   HOOD isn't getting any new funds.

Now, the share price took a huge hit today even before the conversion and sale.

I think, GME has a stronger fanbase and another 50% drop in the next 2-3 months is probably pushing it, but for AMC, I could see a 50% drop hitting.

The GME/AMC holders no longer have stimulus checks or  tax refund money, the last of  the federal employment is drying up for 7.5 million people in September, and evection moratoriums may still lie ahead.

I think a portion GME/AMC holders are college kids that will be returning to campus where bars and concerts will now be available or at full capacity, football games/bets/fantasy, and various other ways to spend money will be more attractive.

People will not be as bored this fall as they were in the winter and spring, GME and AMC will fade in to the mist.

I think they will become increasingly sick of watching the price drop week after week. I think some will be ready to explore other investments after having their first taste of the stock market.

I do believe a lot of these holders are young and GME was one of their first stock purchases.

Finally I do not see how they will continue to throw cash at this, at some point cults and movements die.

All this to say, October/November puts , weekly puts on  GME/AMC in general after August. I don't play puts and I am a bit nervous about the unpredictably of cult apes, but damn it does seem like the end is nigh. I do believe my speculation on the majority of the  GME/AMC demographic and the sentiment changes the fall will bring to them is spot on. Will be mulling this over this over more weekend.

979,GME," I think you're right. I believe GME's high price was sustained by a continuous influx of cash from the retail trading sector, because every smart, long-time GME holder (thinking mostly institutional money here, but also people who played the initial squeeze) has been unloading at these high prices. This being unlike other securities where a price is more likely to be sustained by the market simply agreeing that the price should be what it is. The apes think they keep it high by holding, but I think they keep it high by buying. And so I think it will continue to drop because that cash influx will taper off for all the reasons you said.

They're going to beat management expectations. 

But i've been screaming about the company ever since it hit the 8's, low 9's. The NAV of the SPAC was 10.70 and it actually makes money and has a excellent business model. The Feb ones were ultra cheap (still are), but if you'd bought in last week when it was roughly 9$, you'd have made bank and would have broken past your cost basis for the Feb ones ALREADY.

I've been accumulating more and more shares, and I have the intention to accumulate more next week before earnings. This is a 200% return company by end of year 2023. 

To add to that I have calls: [https://gyazo.com/9e77d5138bcfd304ca067e5233f5719b](https://gyazo.com/9e77d5138bcfd304ca067e5233f5719b)

They're going to beat management expectations. 

But i've been screaming about the company ever since it hit the 8's, low 9's. The NAV of the SPAC was 10.70 and it actually makes money and has a excellent business model. The Feb ones were ultra cheap (still are), but if you'd bought in last week when it was roughly 9$, you'd have made bank and would have broken past your cost basis for the Feb ones ALREADY.

I've been accumulating more and more shares, and I have the intention to accumulate more next week before earnings. This is a 200% return company by end of year 2023. 

To add to that I have calls: [https://gyazo.com/9e77d5138bcfd304ca067e5233f5719b](https://gyazo.com/9e77d5138bcfd304ca067e5233f5719b)

1002,EDU," I see comments like this a lot and I believe most people are misinformed as to the non-profit text of the new policies to be enacted. Basically, no company that offers tutoring for subjects that appear on the school curriculum will be allowed to make a profit and therefore will be obligated to register as a non-profit. 

There isn't some arbitrary risk that EDU or other organization could all of a sudden be labeled non-profit. So what will happen is EDU and other companies like TAL will make transitionary shifts to curriculum that is not included in the school curriculum. I won't go into more detail but there is a lot to be covered outside of those perimeters. 

Moreover, this new transition could be seen as favorable for the large companies like TAL and EDU which have the capital available to make these shifts. Furthermore, the smaller companies would suffer harsher affects/possible bankruptcy which could consolidate the industry even more for these larger companies. 

EDU will make a transition, the profits will suffer in the short term but the company will continue on. if you take the non-profit risk off the table which I have already explained is misunderstood than this company has a high chance of making it through providing investors with returns. Granted this is a long hold and who knows how things will play out. But, I suspect when the Chinese school year starts in Early Sept of this year there will be more clarification.

1004,EDU," Let me direct you to (ventureeducation.org ) you will find an in depth analysis of the "" Dual Alleviation "" process ( Aug 21 ). I didn't want to provide a link but you can easily find it. I also, have the Chinese publicly released regulations. They are in Chinese but you can translate them.

But I'll summarize. First thing is the ban on foreign curricula which hasn't been specified exactly. Basically, anything that does not align with national standards. Next, we have "" subject focused "" topics which are the ones that cannot be taught without registering as a "" non-profit "" which include Ethics, Rule of Law, Culture, History, Geography, Chinese, Mathematics, Foreign Language and Science ( Biology, Physics & Chemistry )

The subjects that are designated as non "" Subject Focused "" are Physical Education, Sports, Health, Art, Music, Fine Arts, Information Technology, Labour and Technology. Basically non-academic skills. Also, let me add that the restrictions stop at the High School level so College and Adult tutoring in any subject is not affected. Not to mention Vocation education which is a very large market in itself. Tutoring for personalized learning. Tutoring to prepare for overseas study: the IELTS and TOFEL exams.

There is also "" A space for schools to partner with non-subject focused institutions to provide after-school tutoring institutions to provide after-school courses to students "" direct quote.

The aim of the policy is to put the burden on the schools themselves to provide the tutoring to make it equal playing ground. This entire policy stems from the desire of the Chinese government to allow 3 children. But, the cost of raising a child hinders parents considering having more children. I'm sure you know this already, but thought I should include this in here.

Furthermore, in this report it is mentioned two times that their might be something known as pilot cities that would essentially test the implementation of these policies. Beijing, Shangai, Shenyang, Guangzhou, Changzhi, Weihai and Nantong are named as pilot cities for testing. Other provinces shall select at least one pilot city.

Another direct quote "" As schools operate longer and seek after school providers, there may be significant opportunities for commercial partnerships. Contracts with public school will likely be monopolies by bigger and more experienced players"".

More things to take into consideration, the announcements strongly prohibit the public marketing of private educations services. Which can be seen as a positive considering EDU doesn't need to do much marketing considering they are one of the largest players in the space.

"" While the policy has been issued by the central government, the detailed interpretation and approach ensuring effective implementation of the policy will need more time to be promulgated at the lock and district level. The implementation will likely involve some variance from region to region. ""

"" The purpose of the new guidelines is to make tutoring part of a healthy education system, restoring its role in providing, students with personalized choices, not to shut down the whole tutoring industry indiscriminately"".

The industry as a whole knew this was coming. TAL and EDU earlier this year have already closed down their under age 6 classrooms in May. The ban for teaching school curriculum to kindergartners came in June but these companies acted ahead. These classrooms were basically a way for parents to have their children learn curriculum from several years ahead. The reason for this is Chinas placement test take later on in life which would dictate their Childs prospect as far as higher education.

So we can expect that these companies have been preparing all this year already for a large policy shift. But honestly, who knows how things will be enacted. It could possibly start with pilot cities as I have mentioned above. The regulations could also be changed if the government decides the results of these pilot cities aren't what they had intended. Or they could enact the policies nationwide in one swipe. But understand these polices might be enacted and enforced differently by each province.

It's hard to say how things will play out. The thing for me as an investor ( I currently own around 4000 shares EDU) is, will the company stay alive and be able to survive in the current regulatory atmosphere. I see the risk of becoming non-profit basically non-existent and I see the probability of the company surviving really high. I certainly don't advise investing though considering the uncertainty of the situation. Also, I could be off on some of these facts as well.

These are just a few things I have pulled. That report is very new and probably one of the most detailed descriptions of the situation.

So, it CAN be a problem, because they have the RIGHT to double the float, but usually companies will do it in a safe and healthy manner (unless you are a penny-biotech stock) by doing it slowly over many years.

1032,MRNA, NVAX taking a beating right now. Even MRNA is down. Something seems to be brewing with Occugen as it's the only vaccine stock that's green. Maybe it has something to do with it's efficacy against the delta variant and impending WHO approval.

1035,DD," This is anecdotal DD. There is technical DD, financial DD, hell, there are tons of different kinds of DD. The financial valuation of a cloud vendor is measured by revenue multiplier, and revenue is determined by enterprise partnerships. Which I spoke directly to.

1038,TLRY, What about Swiss Bank buying 930K shares of TLRY. Isn’t that good news? Even tho it’s few months delayed? You can see percentage increase since last quarter. A whopping 230% higher?

1039,TLRY," 900K shares is not much for a bank. Idk much about TLRY and it could be a great company but the swiss bank buying 900k isn’t significant enough to reinforce that claim. Swiss Bank has over 174B in assets under management, they are heavily diversified, they have more positions than there are stocks on the NYSE. Swiss bank also fits into the Vanguard/Blackrock category. This does not mean TLRY is a bad stock, i’m just saying that the institutional ownership from Swiss Bank shouldn’t be used as a bull case here.",kokanuttt,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ozf9wg/psa_institutional_ownership_can_be_very_misleading/h7zccrn/,0.062,0.85,0.088,0.1154

1046,NKLA," If that really is your entire reason for starting a position, you might as well buy something else. NKLA still has a 4b market cap as a pre-rev company (this is a lot, if we take it's history into account).
