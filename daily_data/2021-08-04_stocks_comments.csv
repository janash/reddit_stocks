0,BABA," @OP: You are not completly correct and you need to do more research into this topic before you do a PSA like this.

Lets look at Alibaba as an example to explain. You can find all this information on their 20-F.

The BABA adr can be exchanged 1:8 for the HK stock for ALIBABA Holding. Alibaba Holding directly ownes all the non Chinese parts of ALIBABA. They are also directly owning some of the chinese parts of ALIBABA. The CCP only restricts foreign investments into certain sectors. In all other sectors foreigners can and do have direct ownership rights.

Only a small Part of Alibaba is not directly or indirectly owned by Alibaba Holdings. For this small part they have VIE contracts. These contracts say that Alibaba Holdings has control over the profits of these Companys and can replace the CEO.

2,RUN," You mention the standards for accounting are different. Technically you are right, but not by much. The thing with Luckin Coffee is that it wasn't due to the accounting standards being different, it was just outright fraud. Case in point: Nikola, Enron, you name it. It happens in the US too. The thing is that Luckin Coffee SETTLED with the SEC, so they BASICALLY got off scott-free. 

The problem is not with accounting standards, the problem is that the CCP doesn't just regulate their market, it has sovereignty over it and that their market is RUN by the CCP.

15,BABA," If you said “Yes, but would they ever really do that?”, ask yourself if YOUR government wouldn’t also maintain every cent of every dollar they could during a time of all out war, something that is very possible in this world with increasingly fewer resources available. And with China’s reputation you can already envision them withholding foreign stocks as a bargaining chip even during a mildly escalating trade war. Your money truly isn’t safe when it would be that  EASY to confiscate it during a time when the world cuts ties with each other, and each country has nothing to lose, everything to gain. 

When you also factor in the crimes against humanity in Hong Kong, the terrifying Uyghur concentration camps, South China Sea, Philippines and India aggressions it’s a  no-brainer. It’s not xenophobia when there is so much rationale- anyone besides a loyal Chinese citizen would be wise to divest IMMEDIATELY.

31,ALL," ADRs are where an American bank holds 1 foreign share and issues 1 share on an American exchange, denominated in American dollars, paying foreign taxes and making filings on your behalf, receiving foreign dividends in foreign currency and forwarding them to you in USD. 

The “normal” ADR shares are fully backed by fully owned ordinary shares. The ADR exists to make it convenient, because the ADR Sponsor will open a brokerage account in Japan, UK, Germany, France, Singapore, etc, fill out the paperwork in Japanese, buy shares in JPY, make appropriate regulatory filings on your behalf. However, the **actual foreign share** is held **in America** by an **American bank**. ADR holders can still vote as if they were shareholders. It’s almost like the old days where $1 was backed by $1 of gold in a bank. 

Chinese stocks are ADRs. But they aren’t backed by shares of the underlying security. They’re shares of a shell company called a VIE. VIE stands for variable interest entity. 

The VIE is an ostensibly independent company that has negotiated **a contract** with a Chinese company for a share of ALL future profits. The VIE then sells shares **of itself** and these become listed in the USA as ADRs. Someone who owns an ADR of a VIE does not own a share of a Alibaba. They own a slice of a company in the Bahamas contractually “guaranteed” payments by Chinese companies. It’s more like an annuities contract to future profits, but written to break Chinese law. 

It’s important to remember that the entire structure of VIEs was invented explicitly ~~break~~ *circumvent* Chinese laws prohibiting foreign ownership of Chinese companies. 

Finally… contracts are only as good as the legal systems that govern them. 

I have strong faith that neither American nor Japanese courts want to fuck up ADRs of Toyota. They may tinker at the margins, maybe with taxes or disclosure. But they won’t invalidate the structure leaving you with nothing.  

I have approximately 0 faith that China’s courts will respect the legal structure of VIE ADRs when it becomes inconvenient for them. The linchpin of a VIE is just a contract governed by Chinese law, circumventing Chinese law, between a Chinese company and a barely nonfictional “company” in the Cayman Islands.

The only different would be that in the USA, there would have been a lawsuit after the fact, and people would have recovered a small, insignificant, fraction of the money they lost, and maybe a few people would have gone to jail.

39,UK," The thing is, no one is lying about it. The companies that made the Cayman ADR's were up front that they are not conveying real shares. They operate in a grey area since they are outside of China and the USA. To me its almost like a black market. I have a feeling that at some point, China will reposes the shares issued by the ADR's for breaking Chinese law. Thats the risk.

What I dont get is why people are hung up on 1 country that doesnt respect them enough to give them legal ownership... If all you want is value, try some non-ADR (less recognized) UK stocks perhaps.

They operate in a grey area since they are outside of China and the USA. To me its almost like a black market.

Weird also how I see no state-run media coming from the White House. Doesn't matter how you place it, CNN and the Washington Post are not the People's Daily. ""Strictly controlling all domestic media"" is not the same as having ties. Nice attempt at comparison though. 

And lobbyism exists all across the world old chum. It exists in Europe, it exists in Japan, it especially exists in China. But do go on with how China is the same considering how they require companies to be basically state-controlled and will crackdown on them (private education, DIDI) or their CEOs (Jack Ma) whenever they like. Look at a basic chart of economic freedom between the two for once. But tell me more though how a modern day fusion of fascism and socialism is comparable to lobbying though. Go on. 

Since when have Americans believed their government? When? That ""telling you what they're telling you is the truth and they know what's best for you"" line falls more with China than anyone in the US because they actually believe it.

* [CFOps for 2019A and 2020A of $1.3bn and $1.9bn, respectively](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/162828021013318/1?cik=1783879&hl=1029792:1029853&hl_id=4y1ue2mjo) - hm for a company that is so shittily run, they sure have been generating a fuck ton of cash flow organically. Imagine that this has the added bonus of dividends to investors, despite being publicly traded for less than a month.
* [Modest capex spend in their S-1; immediate FCF generation](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/162828021013318/1?cik=1783879&hl=1029918:1029933&hl_id=4yjqwnqyi) - capital light business that is shitting free cash flow L2Y. Help me understand why RH is such a shit investment again?

* Cognitive dissonance, confirmation bias, and other logical fallacies that /r/investing and /r/stocks are ***ridiculously*** susceptible to (me speculating here) - most $HOOD bears arrive at their thesis from extrapolating personal experience over RH's entire user base
 * e.g. - reddit incorrectly assumes the RH the user base consists of day traders looking to profit off of short term price movements that are based off of what the billions of other public capital market participants are going to do in the immediate term.....rather than making buy/sell decisions based off of firm-specific and macro fundamentals. 
 * The fact of the matter is that the vast majority of investors see brokerages as offering a commoditized service where you're offering the same service at the lowest cost. **The smart money** sees RH for what it is: a brokerage that charges me $0 in fees and is awarding me free yield. Why tf would I trade away additional return in the form of lower fees relative to what another brokerage would charge me? 

So, again, I'm open to hearing a rational bear case on RH or any sort of pervasive, idiosyncratic risk associated with the ticker that isn't being properly reflect in the current share price.",trill_collins__,8,/r/stocks/comments/oxt5xo/robinhoods_stock_is_spiking_but_this_is_the_time/h7p3gb4/,0.077,0.844,0.079,0.4707

I started on Schwab, because it was recommended to me by a work associate whom I trust and after doing my own research and comparing the different brokers, I also came to trust Schwab because I understood that they were a established broker with a trustworthy reputation.

I can imagine that for someone who has no resources and doesn't know what they don't know about trading/investing, just having an influencer on-line to recommend the app was probably good enough to get them in.

I haven't actually looked at RH's app design, but I would have to assume that their app's design philosophy would have to reflect that.

I hate understaffing.  I hate it more than shitty pay and lack of benefits.  It’s so demoralizing for an employee that busts their ass to do their job well and is so busy but with customers due to understaffing that they can’t complete important tasks.  Tasks that only they are trained to do, and could accomplish if there were staff to do the other, general-employee tasks.

I haven’t run into my local CVS very often, but every time I do, no matter the day or time, I have to wait at an empty register for the poor employee who is also tasked with several other duties.  I know that struggle.

190,CVS," I second that. I worked for CVS for about three years and left over the summer. CVS may be a money maker but they really treat the employees like trash, at least on the retail/pharmacy end. Pharmacy and store were both always understaffed (the pharmacy often to a concerning degree).

191,CVS," Yeah and I get my story is anecdotal but a vast majority of the stores were just like mine. Hour cuts across the board were so bad I couldn’t do payroll or make the schedule like I should. I’d have a list of things to do everyday that I had no time for because I was stuck on a register with my only 16 year old cashier for 8 hours. Staffing was fine, we had the people to do it no problem, but every week I’d come in to find less and less hours to work with. Everyone wanted to work but I couldn’t schedule anyone. Made no sense to me. And then I’d have my district manager come in and wonder why xy&z isn’t done yet. CVS historically does better in a democratic office so the stock might go up but I’m sitting this one out.

254,AR," I’m kinda proud of myself. I’ve been doing a lot of DD the last few days and I’ve been able to throw out a lot of companies that after doing DD, I’m no longer interested in. There’s also a handful of companies I’m not necessarily interesting in buying at the moment, but I’m definitely keeping an eye out for.

Some of my favorites are VUZI and PTRA.

VUZI are involved in augmented reality has a ton of patents. I think AR will be huge in the future with things like smart glasses, video games, and transport.

PTRA I’m very much intrigued by because they currently have products in use in several cities, and they have a very integrated business model. That said, their elective busses that were used by SEPTA in Philadelphia have issues with chassis cracks and damage that has rendered most their Proterra fleet useless. I haven’t heard of any other issues with their busses from other cities, so it doesn’t appear to be a trend.

Also, I’m very interested in the battle for LIDAR technology between LAZR and VLDR. For those who don’t know, LIDAR stands for “light detection and ranging” and has use in autonomous vehicles, security, and even in monitoring traffic. LAZR has a deal with Airbus which is miles better than anything VLDR has. Interestingly, VLDR appears to offer more expensive products and LAZR offers cheaper products which may enable widespread use in civilian autonomous vehicles. That said, VLDR has recently partnered with NVIDIA metropolis, which will monitor traffic and perform traffic analytics. Also, VLDR has partnered with ThorDrive and currently has its LIDAR sensors being tested at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport on autonomous luggage vehicles. The downside of VLDR is that Ford has recently liquidated their partnership with the company at the end of last year. LAZR is markedly ahead of their competitor VLDR but it appears both may be worth the investment in the long run.

My only two remaining questions for y’all is this: how do you all feel about OPEN and SOFI?

I’m bullish on OPEN on nothing more than their business model, but I’m waiting for their next earnings to see if I’ll buy.

SOFI, I think it might be a steal at this price but I’m also hesitant to invest in any student loan stocks at this point in time due to the possibility of student loan forgiveness.",trentthesomalian,3,/r/stocks/comments/oxp0mg/rstocks_daily_discussion_wednesday_aug_04_2021/h7oh3x3/,0.055,0.852,0.092,0.942

That said, VLDR has recently partnered with NVIDIA metropolis, which will monitor traffic and perform traffic analytics. Also, VLDR has partnered with ThorDrive and currently has its LIDAR sensors being tested at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport on autonomous luggage vehicles. The downside of VLDR is that Ford has recently liquidated their partnership with the company at the end of last year. LAZR is markedly ahead of their competitor VLDR but it appears both may be worth the investment in the long run.

My only two remaining questions for y’all is this: how do you all feel about OPEN and SOFI?

I’m bullish on OPEN on nothing more than their business model, but I’m waiting for their next earnings to see if I’ll buy.

SOFI, I think it might be a steal at this price but I’m also hesitant to invest in any student loan stocks at this point in time due to the possibility of student loan forgiveness.",trentthesomalian,3,/r/stocks/comments/oxp0mg/rstocks_daily_discussion_wednesday_aug_04_2021/h7oh3x3/,0.055,0.852,0.092,0.942
256,LAZR," I’m kinda proud of myself. I’ve been doing a lot of DD the last few days and I’ve been able to throw out a lot of companies that after doing DD, I’m no longer interested in. There’s also a handful of companies I’m not necessarily interesting in buying at the moment, but I’m definitely keeping an eye out for.

Some of my favorites are VUZI and PTRA.

VUZI are involved in augmented reality has a ton of patents. I think AR will be huge in the future with things like smart glasses, video games, and transport.

PTRA I’m very much intrigued by because they currently have products in use in several cities, and they have a very integrated business model. That said, their elective busses that were used by SEPTA in Philadelphia have issues with chassis cracks and damage that has rendered most their Proterra fleet useless. I haven’t heard of any other issues with their busses from other cities, so it doesn’t appear to be a trend.

Also, I’m very interested in the battle for LIDAR technology between LAZR and VLDR. For those who don’t know, LIDAR stands for “light detection and ranging” and has use in autonomous vehicles, security, and even in monitoring traffic.

293,BNS," I get the honor and the pleasure of being the first with this video from Jim Cramer in August 2007 that I stumbled upon.  Worth a watch for anyone interested in the 2007/08 Global Financial Crisis:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOVXh4xM-Ww](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOVXh4xM-Ww)

Context: Two Bear Stearns hedge funds have collapsed and French bank BNS Paribas has frozen deposits and expressed doubt about the market for US asset-backed securities.  Fed chair Ben Bernanke is more worried about inflation than providing liquidity to the market and Cramer gives him a piece of his mind.

I looked this up while reading Bernanke's book *The Courage to Act* where he mentions the episode.  Apparently he didn't watch the clip.

Not using this to say ""omg a crash is coming"", just found it to be an interesting piece of financial history.  I don't really like Mr. Cramer but do feel his critique of Bernanke being out of touch with the real world was valid at the time.  I also feel that a similar critique could be made towards Jay Powell nowadays.  Politics and speculation aside, however, I think the video is worth a watch just to see how crazy things were back then.

([Cramer's comments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGwgKqTKMFQ) on the episode 10 years later are worth a watch, too)",shortyafter,2,/r/stocks/comments/oxp0mg/rstocks_daily_discussion_wednesday_aug_04_2021/h7nqqq5/,0.067,0.845,0.088,0.5155

416,AMD," Absolutely. AMD and XLNX have agreed to a merger in which 1 share of XLNX will equal 1.72 shares of AMD. The merger is currently being approved by regulators in Europe and China and my guess is that China fears have created this arbitrage situation. If the merger fell through - which is seems unlikely to do in my opinion - people generally think XLNX will fall from its current $140 to around $100. No idea what the AMD stock would do - I'm just parroting what I've read elsewhere.

So - as of right now AMD is around $120 and XLNX is around $140. If price according to the merger terms, XLNX should be trading at $206 to equal 1.72 shares of AMD ($120 x 1.72 = $206). I'm currently selling my AMD and buying XLNX under the belief that the merger will go through. As the merger date approaches (later 2021, early 2022) the arbitrage opportunity will disappear and the prices of the two stocks will follow that 1.72:1 ratio that I mentioned earlier. There is risk but I have not seen anything in the news to suggest the merger won't occur, so I am comfortable converting my shares now to take advantage of that \~30% differential ($140 vs $206). The downside is probably around a 30% loss ($140 to $100) if the merger fails, but again, I'm long AMD and would LOVE an opportunity for a discount on the share price via arbitrage.",chickenfriedsandwich,3,/r/stocks/comments/oxp0mg/rstocks_daily_discussion_wednesday_aug_04_2021/h7onjrs/,0.059,0.807,0.133,0.9616

I'm in a similar boat, my break even price is around $75.

519,GME," I would think the same thing you are. But after looking at their numbers and reliving their users held almost double what e-trade holds and it was the 3rd largest brokerage in terms of assets I see the opportunity. Especially when you consider they just started to tap into other ways to make money like Robinhood Gold. If you also look at their user base you will see it is made up of mostly young investors under 45. Long term if they can get into stuff like IRAs and other financial products they may really grow.  Just my opinion I get why people where mad about GME. To me it is growing pains of a market disruptor. 

As a disclosure: I was an early adopter of the app. I got on board early back. I read about it when it was a startup backed by Google. Prior to that I was very interested in investing but was getting eaten alive by Fees and turned off to account minimums I was just a broke college kid. 

To me they leveled the playing field I could care less they make money on PFOF. It is still a fraction of what I would pay. Most companies do this and also require other money to. Some people just got angry it wasn’t perfectly free to use. If someone wants to make an average of $0.04 per stock off of my order I am okay with that as long as I am not paying $5.00.",ThiftyMcVay,1,/r/stocks/comments/oxeg71/hood_stock_future/h7q808l/,0.065,0.783,0.153,0.9726
520,IMO," Yeah I think there's a good bear case to be made at this price. 

For one thing I think the payment for order flow model could one day face some regulatory scrutiny but that aside. There's almost no cost to switch for users. The payment for order flow doesn't make you much money from people who buy+hold so even if some users get older and have more money in the accounts if the strategies don't involve a lot of trading it doesn't make robinhood more profitable. And the AUM is just over 3x the market cap- that's a lot. 

Obviously it's apples and oranges (because no other company is profitable with payment for order flow model) but compare the AUM: Market cap ratio of 3 for Robinhood to Blackrock's AUM/Market cap of 73. One has shown they can turn assets into profit, the other has a long way to go. 

I'm not betting against Robinhood but to justify the market cap revenue is going to have to come from new offerings IMO.",Mad_Nekomancer,7,/r/stocks/comments/oxeg71/hood_stock_future/h7mlwuy/,0.026,0.873,0.1,0.9233
