3,AMC, Trailing stop loss the moment you enter a trade like this. I start with 3% then when it gets over a 10% gain I‚Äôll move it to 5% and then let it roll. Guarantee you get a profit of at least 5% and you will typically ride it to the top. Did this with AMC and all the meme stocks on their big up days and what I use when day trading. Worst case you get the 5% profit and you can always buy back in and set it at 3% again.,StockNCryptoGodfathr,3,/r/stocks/comments/nxtbig/nobody_ever_went_broke_taking_profits_a_personal/h1gs5u6/,0.084,0.764,0.152,0.7096
4,SP," Honestly think ""nobody ever went broke taking profit"" is terrible advice.

The entire concept of ""taking profit"" implies you don't understand how to valuate a company.  If you understand the company, then you would have a thesis and a price target for a future date.  As new information comes out, you'd adjust your expectations accordingly, and you'd sell when the SP hit your target.

""Taking profit"" suggests you have no idea whether the stock should continue to grow based on its fundamentals (i.e. you never really understood the fundamentals in the first place).",SourerDiesel,2,/r/stocks/comments/nxtbig/nobody_ever_went_broke_taking_profits_a_personal/h1gtiez/,0.08,0.806,0.115,0.5574

9,ALL," Set some trigger sells.

Let‚Äôs say you bought 600 shares and it jumped up 65%? Set some trigger sells for a portion of the shares, maybe 200? Maybe 400?, to go when it drops back down to +45%, you don‚Äôt lose ALL of your gains and if it still has traction to get back up? You have some shares in corner and maybe you already pulled out your initial investment.

If you feel it at that point? Set a trigger buy when/if it drops even lower, if you still believe in the fundamentals and it ‚Äúshould‚Äù go back up again. Understanding the fundamentals is key though, that takes you from gambling to being a day trader.

There‚Äôs nothing with doing that.",Strange-Scarcity,1,/r/stocks/comments/nxtbig/nobody_ever_went_broke_taking_profits_a_personal/h1ivvwy/,0.039,0.883,0.079,0.6199

I have no problems with Vanguard, the mobile app can use a bit of an update on Ui, but since i do most of my trading in a computer a primitive mobile app is not an issue for me. Been trading meme stocks with them too. They have not let me down so far.. i got tired of RH having technical difficulties and giving me a notifications every minute.. 

Vanguard said they are working on a more modern mobile app so i will look into that.

111,III," Mimedx is developing a micronized injectable amniotic therapeutic biologic treatment for musculoskeletal conditions such as knee osteoarthritis.  The Amniofix Injectable product has shown great promise in earlier studies and a Phase III study for the treatment of plantar fasciitis along with a Phase IIb study for the treatment of knee osteoarthritis just recently concluded. The company has announced that data from these studies will be released in late summer, prior to the expiration of the September calls. Also, Mimedx is being added to the Russell 2000, Russell 3000 and Russell Micro-cap Indexes by the end of the month which will creat demand for shares of the company. 

Exact Sciences is working on a blood based multi-cancer screening test and believes it has the ability to bring the best test to the market, which in the US is estimated to be at least $25 billion annually. They have an amazing team and unmatched resources in place to accomplish this goal. There will be many preliminary data readouts on this and other tests under development to serve as catalysts over the next six or seven months. 

Due your own diligence. It is fun and interesting to actually learn about the companies you are invested in. I am heavily invested in Exact Sciences because I believe in their science and products. I have already taken their Cologuard colorectal cancer screening test twice and am a big fan!  I have spoken with individuals who have used Minedx's Amniofix Injectable product on their knees and it has changed their lives for the better, enabling them to avoid having to have their knees replaced!

139,CLX," I wouldn‚Äôt say paying a dividend is giving up. Ultimately a company‚Äôs goal is to make money for shareholders. This is by growth of course, but also profitable operations that generate cash flow. A dividend means the company has balanced its cash flow such that it can grow and pay shareholders. Take CLX for example. They aren‚Äôt a growth company but their share price is still rising with a regular dividend paid (even before the pandemic slicked sales).

Personally I only invest where is growth potential. Waiting for dividends is similar to selling call options in my mind. You‚Äôre giving up time for a set payment in the future. In that time the underlying stock could fall and more than negate the value of the small payment you are waiting for. Balancing time and risk is key to making consistent profits.",RelativeStrengthPro,9,/r/stocks/comments/ny2m4w/the_catch22_with_dividends/h1i27hb/,0.028,0.796,0.176,0.9711
140,IMO," In some businesses, incremental growth comes at a lower rate of return that what is expected from shareholders and thus a divided is paid out to shareholders for them to redeploy in higher incremental return investments. It has no bearing on the business being good or bad. 

I will say that American companies tend to stick with a dividend and ALWAYS pay it out, regardless of availability of opportunity. US shareholders get used to the dividends and go up in arms when they get cut or reduced; however, IMO I would way rather have management cut my dividend if they see a golden opportunity and capitalize on it. Capital allocation is hugely important for the running of a business and I would think a long term holder would be okay with those cuts in the dividend for the sake of the security/growth of the business",Glittering_Ability94,2,/r/stocks/comments/ny2m4w/the_catch22_with_dividends/h1jf2fy/,0.102,0.8,0.098,0.101
