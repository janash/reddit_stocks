The offering price was, strangely enough, a premium to Friday's close of $26.12 and suggests that Mudrick is now also in on the joke, and is hoping to buy more stock at a higher price while squeezing shorts in the process boosting his existing holdings",jroche1987,159,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/npso9s/amc_sells_85_million_shares/h06tjj3/,0.013,0.918,0.069,0.8176

1. There’s the rent moratorium - once that ends sellers might be itching to sell.
2. The forbearance and the foreclosure halt. 
3. FOMO and some throttling from the whale investments in real estate

Edit: adding a few more factors

4. Easy money - which affords people to keep multiple houses

5. Reverse repo - which means that there’s more cash and not enough assets

6. Family funds going bust - this is indirect but affects banks and lending


These things seem to prop it up and the question is how long? I think there is a huge bubble about to pop. If you study 1900s history you will see similarities to now. Artificial real estate boom caused by the war and the veterans housing back then was creating a frothy market. The populist movement which is now what’s happening with GME / amc and other meme stocks. Then finally the boom in investing in the financial markets.

188,IMO," I was an REO listing specialist for nine different banks/ asset managers from 2006-2012. I sold foreclosed properties for all those years, at prices cheaper than cars. 
IMO we’re at the same point in housing now that we were in 2006 pre-housing shit bomb. Houses were flying off the shelves then, too, for top dollar; right up until they weren’t. The house of cards that was mortgage backed securities imploded and you saw what came after. Did anyone go to jail? Hell no! They paid off politicians via PACs and government agencies via ‘fines’ aka ‘the cost of doing business’ and kept on keeping on. They got bailed out and continued like nothing happened. 

Money managers and hedge funds have been busy during the pandemic, fucking with the stock market and naked short selling companies into bankruptcy, while they raked in 🤑$$$, just like they did back then. They’ve made trillions of dollars while the little guy has gotten screwed. As per usual. 
Well guess what? The whole shit show is on the verge of collapse again. Stock and housing markets are fucked. Greed driven chaos is right around the corner. Again. 

Do your own research, don’t take my word for it. Info is out there if you care to look. 
We all need a place to live, so get something affordable and strap in.

But housing prices can very well fall, and fall hard. There is a massive supply crunch right now, from a variety of factors, many temporary. It will move towards equilibrium, and this ridiculousness will end. People won’t be dropping 30% over asking for long.

I don’t think it will be a “crash”, but a massive correction is very much in the cards.

Of course there is hyper inflation risk, which IMO is valid, but at this point way overstated.

270,AMC," Let me tell you why BB is the play:

1.	⁠GME and AMC already has runs, not saying the runs are over but they’ve had some runs. BB has yet to run. This is surprising as its grouped with the meme stocks.
2.	⁠BB market cap is a third of GME and half of AMC, so it’s that much easier to double.
3.	⁠GME has a reason to run up, AMC I don’t really know the reason...no hate here. BB is a real stock with real implication. If it wasn’t called BB it would be 100+ by now.

https://investorplace.com/2021/05/blackberry-by-any-other-name-would-have-a-much-higher-valuation/

4. BB has been flat for months now. It has found its support. It should not go much lower from what it’s priced at now. So a bottom of 8$ and a high of 25+ that’s a no brainer. The risk is asymmetrical. I would buy shares because we don’t know when it will blow up, but when it dos there will be serious FOMO. 5. BB is the 2nd most mentioned ticker on this sub and it hasn’t even gone up yet (or gone down), it hasn’t even made its move!!!

492,AMD," So far, Intel shows no signs that it is willing to do what is necessary to catch up.  AMD still has a ton of market they're going to consume.  I don't know why you think demand will ever fall as part of people going back to offices.  Most of the high-margin growth is in cloud infrastructure and company resources aren't going to revert to on-prem datacenters that the companies have to deal with.  Third-party managed datacenters (cloud) will just continue to expand.  Investors should expect steady growth, as there's no real barriers in place and AMD are the ones doing all the innovation in the space while their main competitor is structured in a way that makes innovation as difficult as possible for them.",otakucode,4,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/npllt6/amd_adds_tesla_as_a_customer/h06yun9/,0.063,0.841,0.095,0.6486

978,AMC," So there are a couple of things to note I guess. It is not inherently bad for a firm to sell more shares, assuming that the expected value from the additional capital is greater than the dilutive effect. There are a few caveats with AMC, and other stocks which have had run-ups. 

First, is the optics issue. Mudrick pushed for no lockup period, and immediately sold the stock. That is basically egg on the face of management. If it was an institutional investor who took a legitimate long position and held, the sale would look much better. Instead, the sale is basically a huge advertisement for how big players think the stock is overvalued (it probably is, but you don't want to put out a press release saying that). What I bring up in my post also adds to how the optics are bad, even if the firm never technically ""lied""

Second, the fact that the shares made there way to the market so quickly also potentially draws SEC scrutiny. There was a lot of discussion earlier in the year with AMC and GME on how the SEC was paying attention, and something like this is going to make the SEC take a closer look. Basically, one could argue that the fact that Mudrick sold immediately and made a huge profit means that AMC didn't do their due diligence and sold at a price that was too low, basically screwing current shareholders out of the additional cash that could have otherwise been raised. It might also raise concerns that there was some sort of backroom deal. I mean, the fact that they were sold BEFORE the company announced the offering is suspicious to say the least.

Finally, there are two ways for companies to raise money (generally), debt and equity. AMC's debt rating has strengthened considerably, and so debt issuance was a potential way to get cash without any dilutive effect. They also state in their press release that they are looking to make acquisitions. In theory they could have done these acquisitions as stock deals too, and still gotten to make use of their increased equity prices.

Ultimately, I am not trying to make the point that selling additional shares is bad. Rather my point was that we may want to be a bit skeptical of the hype train where executives are involved.",illachrymable,7,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/npzfzx/a_reminder_that_ceos_are_not_wsbers/h08ixua/,0.067,0.835,0.098,0.9159

But from a business standpoint, this is exactly what he should have done.  The business has more debt than assets, it makes a lot of sense to raise capital through sale of equities, if people are willing to pay for them.  He's not concerned about your short squeeze or whatever, he's just happy to play the part, so that the business can survive.

I dont think people realize how much AMC is dancing on the razor's edge.  They are not just a meme stock, they're a business that is still in deep shit after the pandemic.",OlyBomaye,27,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/npzfzx/a_reminder_that_ceos_are_not_wsbers/h08cr6s/,0.108,0.799,0.093,-0.1886
991,AMC," Correct, but they do still make questionable business decisions with the $ they’ve recently made in hopes that retail investors will continue to rally for them & keep them afloat.  While this may have started to “save them”, lets be honest that most people jumped in because they thought they would get rich.  Technically, AMC should be bankrupt by now.  I don’t think a short squeeze is even possible if they continue dilution, which they’ve done several times since this started.  If it happens then great for everyone who believed in it but I just don’t see it ever getting there with this one🤷🏻‍♀️",SykeYouOut,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/npzfzx/a_reminder_that_ceos_are_not_wsbers/h08fbzt/,0.064,0.779,0.157,0.9186

993,AMC," It's appropriate for the business to pay down debt so they can operate in a stronger financial position going forward. If we are just hyping up the stock to profit and upset that AMC is taking necessary steps to survive, then we are no different from short sellers. Invest in AMC for the turnaround potential. 

Why would anyone think there could be a short squeeze on this stock with the amount of shares trading though? I'm in it for profit of course but for the long term.",subsetsum,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/npzfzx/a_reminder_that_ceos_are_not_wsbers/h08ioj4/,0.07,0.849,0.081,0.2382

1005,BB," Options are a little complicated.   

OP bought the right to buy BB at $12.50/share by June 11.  For this right, he paid $1.12 premium PER SHARE optioned.  Options are sold in 100 share blocks, and he bought 219 contracts.  So he bought the right to buy 21,900 shares by June 11 for $12.50 each,  and this play cost about $24,500.

The problem is, as that price target becomes less likely the closer we get, the VALUE of those options are dropping.  He could have bought those same Options now for 50 cents/share, or less than half what he paid.

The $10.04 you see is the current price.

The reason the break even price is higher than his strike price is, he would need the value of the shares optioned to rise enough to also cover the premium he paid to buy the option contracts, so that's where the $13.62 number comes from.   

But if BB starts moving up quickly,  the value of the Options could go up above $1.12/share, in which case he could sell the Options at a profit even if the stock price itself didn't hit the $13.62.

Options are priced on volatility,  so the bigger and faster a stock swings in price, the more Options cost.",Bigfoot_Cain,17,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/npfbmp/i_screwed_myself_right/h05euah/,0.021,0.885,0.094,0.9179

1068,DD," I got roped in by the convincing DD a few months ago and bought in at $18 like an idiot.

The schmucks actually rooting against the market broad market are only trying to/only ever going to benefit from overcorrection. How can a reopening (increasing volume) market experiencing major inflation overcorrect downward? Inflation means higher real prices for all commodities and that means stonks.

1499,SBUX," I have an EV and chargers are scattered.  There's no clear company that has any real type of market share besides Tesla and their super charging network.  I doubt Tesla builds those super chargers in house from start to finish.  Find out who they work with to install and maintain them and I'd bet you could find some money.

I remember when I thought I missed the boat on SBUX and they kept growing and growing.  Keep in mind that Tesla's super charging is not free.  In addition to generating revenue from selling vehicles (and service), they are going to have a continuous revenue from super charging fees.  The more vehicles they sell, the more people will be out there relying on super charging.

Of the places I've charged my vehicle, one was a chargepoint location that was free.  The rest are installed in private businesses or city parking lots, some company installs them and the business pays for the electricity ... and they have all been free to use.  The company installing them may make money doing so, but there's no ongoing revenue.  I have seen chargepoint chargers in my area that charge a fee, but there are so many free-to-use chargers around that I wouldn't use them.",richietee757,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/npr0yc/blink_charging_and_the_ev_market/h076lth/,0.068,0.846,0.085,0.5643

Discovery wasn't shorted to wheres its at now, the reason why it lost almost 50% of its value its because of what happened to that hedge fund that had a margin call and was force to liquidate its entire positional a few months ago (link included for full info)  
So unless another huge fund buys back that amount its just not going up, or i should say it may bot go up enough for you to profit of it. If you had just looked up the top shorted stocks list you would of noticed that DISCA isn't even on that list and that alone should of rang a bell.

1533,DD," Full transparency - I'm really not expecting a squeeze here; this was a move based on FA, TA and carefully watching the options market here.  I bought one trading session too early on this which is why I'm currently upside down and will ultimately limit my profits on this trade.
