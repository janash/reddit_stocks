55,UK," Did you mean Deveron instead of Devon? There's a whiskey called Dartmoor that comes out of Devon, UK, but as far as Scottish Highland whiskey there is no Devon...there's Deveron, distilled by MacDuff, which is relatively close to the Macallan distillery. 

That being said, when recommending whiskies I personally would shy away from basing a recommendation solely on region. To use your recommendation as an example....while both Macallan and Deveron bottle 12 year single malts, Macallan is aged in Spanish sherry casks/Sherry seasoned American oak (depending which expression of the 12 you get); and Deveron 12 is aged exclusively in ex-Bourbon casks, seeing zero sherry influence. So sure they might be just down the road from each other, but the flavor profile similarities end with the content of the malt.

If you're looking for another Highland single malt with heavy sherry influence reminiscent of Macallan, I would suggest giving Glendronach 12 a try. And if location is important, the Glendronach distillery is actually closer to Macallan than MacDuff is ;)

78,TD," Not financial advice, I literally poopoo and peepee onto my crayon drawings for the thrill of the sport. 

I will explain to you what I wish someone explained to me when I first started trading stocks. Don't throw your money into the market without going to a brokerage like TD Ameritrade or Fidelity, and download their trading software (Thinkorswim for TD, or Active Trader for Fidelity) and look up tutorials. These softwares usually have ""paper trading"", or the ability to make trades without real money for the sake of practice. The bottom line, is to learn your respective software (which one really doesn't matter), and read as much as you can about the different styles people have for interacting with the market. Using paper money for a few years is the best bet, as you'll get to know your own trading strategy and observe the market's behavior over a long period of time. You'll quickly find that a trading strategy might work in a certain market condition, but will completely fall flat in another condition. This is because no matter what you read on Reddit, or Motley Fool, or Seeking Alpha, or even Finviz, ZERO PEOPLE other than the market makers on Wall Street that have access to the real-time order flows have any idea whether or not a stock will go up or down. This is why it's so important to do what another user said and download a balance sheet for a random company, since these numbers are part of the ""fundamentals"" of a company and are pretty much all you're going to get in determining how well their stock price will do. Even then, it's flirting with divination. 

If you really want to help your family, consider investing in an index fund (look up tickers $VTI, $VOO, $QQQ). Index funds (and ETFs) are baskets of stocks that are bought by an investment bank that track a certain index. They allow you to invest in a highly diversified collection of stocks that track a certain part of the market or even a particular industry. $VTI, for example, is an index fund that tracks the total stock market, and moves up or down with the general trends of the market (the general trend historically, of which, is up). It even pays a dividend, which is basically a quarterly/monthly payment YOU receive for holding a stock. Index funds, since they are tracking a large, diversified basket of stocks, allow you to reap the benefits of diversification, without the need to learn how to be a star stock-picker or applied portfolio management. In fact, the returns you will get from investing in an index fund, over long periods of time, will almost always (by a large margin) beat stock-picking. Active managers simply do not make better returns over long periods of time than the overall index. That said, a few grand tossed into just $TSLA a few years ago would've made you a millionaire. It's a crap shoot, so if you don't have the money to lose, focus on saving and investing in safe bets as you build up your war chest. Being fiscally responsible and productive will help those around you more than picking the next $GME.",DoctorWalnut,9,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mihe0g/i_bought_on_the_way_down_and_on_the_way_up_does/gt5378c/,0.044,0.835,0.121,0.9884

85,DD," >how do you know? If the only people that know are the ""market makers on Wall Street"" when a stock will go up and down, why do you invest when you do?   

You don't is the simple answer. Market makers don't either. 

The first thing to understand is that a stock is only worth what people think it's worth; and what they think it is worth is what they're willing to pay for it.   

How do you determine that? Well like you've said you look into the fundamentals of a company. What do they offer? What is the demand of that service or product? Is there a place for it? What growth have they shown to improve our expand? Are they getting rid of dead weight in the company? Are they early in their market and in your opinion completely under valued based on what they're offering? Are they hiring known people with a history of massive returns. Etc etc for a million other reasons and possibilities.   

We call this doing your Due Diligence, or DD for short. It's making sure that before you decide to go long on a company that you have done as much research as possible and have a very high certainity that it is going to plan out as you see. It's a risk, it's always a risk, because going back to what I said although you may be ""right"" if the majority don't agree on your valuation then you're out of luck. But if you're early and it sky rockets then congratulations you've hit gold, enjoy your tendies.   

Selling is purely when you feel its the right time to do it. There's a saying on this sub if it's good enough to screen shot it's good enough to realise (sell). But people are greedy and usually hang on for more and more and lose out as the market corrects itself.   

Some companies are seen as ""safe"" due to their consistent year on year profits, like Coca-Cola, but because of this your investment is unlikely to make any substantial growth in the short term, because its expected to perform very high, so it has a slow trend up and tends to trade sideways.   

But it all boils down to doing your research, having a great understanding of the product and its application, and trying to spot future trends etc. Then making sure youre not blinded by your own research and challenge it to make sure you're right.   

There are things like ETFs that exist that are basically a group of companies all put into one ""stock"", and they're fairly reliable because even if only one company fails to perform the other companies in that ETF can make up for it.   

The most common one I expect you to know of is $SPY. Which is a group of the top performing companies in America. SPY 100 = Top 100. SPY 500 = Top 500 etc. But that's another topic.",StickDoctor,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mihe0g/i_bought_on_the_way_down_and_on_the_way_up_does/gt5dyzn/,0.033,0.85,0.117,0.9884

156,GF," My last GF said I constantly reach over to play with her in the middle of the night. 

I didn't believe her and asked why she never wakes me up. 
She said she has but I always just go straight back to sleep. 

So I told her to make sure I don't go back to sleep. Finally she got me to stay awake and not only did I remember that time I remembered a few seconds leading upto the moment she woke me up. I was wondering how my hands found her goodies if I was asleep. I could see in my mind where she was without looking. Like I was aware of her orientation in space. Almost like psychic but probably more like a memory. 

I've kicked and punched girlfriends in my sleep thinking that I was in a fight with someone as well as kicking and punching walls. I have had a few other girlfriends and even my ex wife said I grope them in my sleep and I have even had a couple one night stands accuse me of knowingly groping them in THIER sleep.

You can even do an aggressive CC strategy where you choose a closer strike near at the money for quick in and out plays more short term.

Possibly due to low pay, but I can survive for a year or two, and find something for much more money after that, providing our industry doesn't get nuked in the meantime.

 CNC programming is a lot more... conversational, you describe an area on a workpiece that you want the machine to cut and the program you're using will do all the calculations for the moves the machine needs to make. Usually off a model you're using. It's less about the programming and more about visualising how the machine will move, and knowledge of cutting speeds and feeds for different materials.

Its price factors in the likely hood to survive the death of ICE and who do you think is in the best position to do that? The company making EV with basically no debt and no legacy plants or the company making loads of legacy out of loads of legacy plants with a massive debt.

206,CCS," Won't be able to scale to compete at a meaningful level for a while. The Model S and 4680 cells ramping up next year is almost a death knell for Lucid's current technology. 

There are three aspects that buyers care about in electric car quality(looks, interior, fit and finish, driving capability), range(how far), and infrastructure. Right now lucid can compete on quality and range however when 4680s are starting mass production that range advantage goes away with structural battery and 15% boost in battery capacity. Combined with the supercharger network allowing a much better infrastructure that ""just works"" it becomes hard to compete. 

Lucid is aiming for a significantly higher end market. The profitability per car should be there but battery constraints and using CCS which is reliant on the electrify America network isn't exactly a good thing for the next 2 years. The problem with CCS is that there aren't as many stations and the stations don't have as many stalls as VW only builds the bare minimum. 

Tesla has the first mover advantage with charging, economies of scale with new factories/giga press/battery factory, and the kinks mostly figured out.

Lucid can compete however they'll need to ramp production quickly(difficult look at Ford delaying delivery of Mach-E) while simultaneously maintaining a technological edge and getting their cars out quickly to keep up.

225,GM," EVs from ICE-age car makers have generally failed to impress. Certainly failed to de-thrown Tesla as the technological leader. 

It would appear Tesla is the Apple of smartphones. Yes, there is Samsung, and many others. But there is only one Apple.

Most importantly, Tesla is way ahead of the pack in battery procurement and production. The number of EVs you can sell depends on the number of batteries you can source. Ford, GM and others are trying to scale-up, but they woke up late, and will trail Tesla in number of EVs sold for the foreseeable future, because they will trail Tesla in the number of batteries they can get their hands on. 

As EVs become more common place, the Osborne effect will likely hit ICE-age car makers very very hard. Given they already have significant debt, a sales network that stands to lose from the EV transition (far less maintenance), less-then-stellar software expertise (and I'm being very kind here) in a market that is more and more heavily impacted by software - all this doesn't bode well for the incumbents.

The car industry is in the early stages of a technological revolution. In such cases the new players often become dominant, and the few incumbents that survive lose their position of dominance.

And we haven't started talking about autonomous driving. Should this become a reality, we're talking about an even bigger revolution, hitting an already embattled industry.",shaim2,8,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mijpld/tesla_reports_180338_vehicles_produced_184800/gt54xnl/,0.075,0.839,0.086,-0.3382

Take energy, it’s just been found that Tesla is the source for the batteries at the apple energy project. It’s a massive project that’s been contracted for a year with no PR and even now its due to a member of the public finding out and making public. The markets and pros don’t factor in energy at all but there it is slowly growing on grid level projects, not exciting as its boring infrastructure but infrastructure is large in $$ the more it gets deployed.

FSD is another one, now it’s a cost but once its working it will be a saving. The majority are hoping mobileye works it out for them, they then hope mobileye don’t screw them by just upping the monthly charge.

Tesla can also just sell FSD to others for the same fee mobileye will be taking. The EV network is also a future revenue stream that looks like it’s moving in to commercial reality soon.

Nio is a real competitor as they have the backing of the Chinese government do debt is only a problem if they are politically an issue for the government. So no debt, rapid R&D and massive market.

Workhorse seems to deliver less than Tesla does Vs its hope. So they may be a risk in the future but they seem to be in the same value to risk/potential as tesla but with less deliveries

Anyone saying that ICE is finished doesn't understand what sports car enthusiasts will do for their passion.  nor do they understand that the infrastructure for ICE is *already there*.  ICE isn't going anywhere.  Will Gasoline rain from the sky?  Maybe not.  But haven't you heard about synthetic green fuels?  Porsche is working on one right now.  Gevo is making biofuel for airlines.  it's only a matter of time before we have a no-compromise green synthetic fuel alternative for ICE automobiles, that can be deployed via the pre-existing national gas station infrastructure.  I personally think that day will come much sooner than the day where all new vehicles sold in the US are EV.

344,UBER," Crazy that they don't count PUA/PEUC continuing claims when that is the real amount of continuing claims. only counting claims in the 1st 6 months (state benefit period) gives you an idea of the 6 month rolling # of new claims but not total outstanding. Total unemployment rate is well above 6% still. 

This will bump treasuries up but I still believe any inflation will be transient; I think the Fed is correct in this case and not necessarily just jawboning. Short term there are supply constraints increasing prices combined with an influx of 1 time fiscal stimulus. However, over the long term you cannot really have sustained inflation without an increase in wages and/or a decrease in taxes. Wages account for at least 70% of total inflation. There can be a number of factors leading to inflation in the short term as rates rise such as low margin unprofitable companies like UBER being forced to increase prices as it becomes more difficult to borrow. Companies increasing prices as adspend costs continue to rise. The problem is there needs to be an equilibrium and if these prices increase while there is only a constant pool of money available to be spent, there will be less total sales, putting pressure on those prices.

I also see no evidence that the economic outlook going forward is really any stronger than it was in 2019 despite that being the narrative. I see people talking about a reversal of the tech/globalism induced deflationary trend of the last 20 years but other than a potential decoupling from China (which I don't believe will happen) I don't have reason to believe this is the case.",PajeetScammer,6,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mijsbo/march_jobs_report_payrolls_rise_by_916000/gt5v2su/,0.127,0.821,0.052,-0.974

408,ASO," Bastard. My first 10 short term options were all fucking stupid plays. I guess that’s kind of the entry price for learning. However, I’ve started to get the hang of it. Made 4k (400%) on semiconductors last week and already up 100% on ASO.

This seems solid and I wish I had purchased more 10 - 30c and 10 - 35c both for 4/16. I think people really expected this to drop after shares unlocked on the 30th, but it didn’t budge. 

The 35c options were so cheap and OTM last week that they were at 0 delta - ie. MMs considered them free money and was no reason to hedge. Well, that changed fast and even those are up now. 

The earnings report wasn’t just good, it was monstrous. Record gains in sales, earnings, revenue, even an increase In e-commerce of 100%. 

The short ratio on this thing is 10 days. People keep parroting this “not everything is a short squeeze,” because they heard some smarter chucklefuck say it about another stock, but it absolutely plays a role in some situations. The last 3 days were massive, just look at the charts. Unless all those buyers were shorts covering (we can see that they aren’t) and none of the momentum was brought on buy the amazing earnings, there are going to be a lot of people trying to get out of this before the 4/16s print.

Academy has product offerings in wellness & fitness. So gym equipment, supplements, bandages, ropes, weights etc.

They have equipment for all sports, guys and girls. Tennis, Golf, baseball, basketball and football. So rackets, clubs, golf bags, bats, rims, helmets etc.

They carry all major sporting clothing for day wear and training. Nike, UA, Addidas, and cheaper versions like Champion and Rebock.

They have shoes for all sports, guys and girls, men and women. They have fratty and dad shoes like New Balance. They have running brands like Brooks and Oasics too. 

They carry work boots and boots would that would be needed on a ranch or hiking in Big Bend NP. They have shoes for wadding and fishing, if that’s your thing.

They sell a shit ton of guns and ammo, and they will also help you get your hunting and fishing permits too. Obviously they sell fishing rods and bait and tackle. They sell hunting camo and Magellan and Columbia fat person deep sea fishing shirts too.

They sell tents for camping and tents for tailgating. They sell bikes and tires.

515,CC," Risk on a covered call is that your 100 shares are called away if your option goes ITM. I always make sure to set my strike at a price I would be willing to sell my shares at for a profit. I generally only sell 2-3 weeks out expiry as I want the option to expire worthless. The only downside to this is if your stock moons you cap your upside by being forced to sell your shares at your lower strike price. So say I buy 100 shares of stock for $25 share. I then sell a covered call two weeks out at a strike of $30. If the stock doesn’t hit $30 in that two weeks I keep all my premium and the option expires worthless.

“Before Microsoft started using MEMS technology, some executives believed it would be many years before the company could improve the HoloLens field of view. ""It was a significant engineering problem,"" said Zulfi Alam, a general manager who worked on the displays and screens of the HoloLens

Kipman called the new approach a ""miracle.""”

568,PLTR," I’m going to assume you are either self employed or a low level associate. 

I’ve been blessed to have RSOs and a good amount.

when you execute the RSO you have to pay taxes immediately on them like your paycheck you get from your job. 

You also have a date you must execute the RSO so he can’t sit on them for ever.  The media didn’t report how many shares he got but all he did was this.

The issue is that it might not do that and you will quickly lose 90% of your investment. Once you lose 90%, you are better off gambling the remainder value to expiration. Well, that's what I would do given the situation. 

But if the stock jumps dramatically, you'll make some nice money and that's the risk/reward decision to be made. If you are OK vaporizing your investment for the possible reward, go for it. If not, you can get out of those calls asap and buy the shares instead. Another option is to exit the calls and sell short a GME put.

Monday EOD it will be -$7080, for your total investment return.

Tuesday -$7850

Wednesday -$8620

Thursday -$9390

Friday -$10,160 bare min..

Lastly, and don’t forget, MY FAVORITE way to lose $, factor In theta kill by the market makers churning the stock....and it expires worthless.**

One again this is all things staying equal and constant, and pending a godsend prayer from the stonk gods.

Also, if the stock stays constant, the contract theta will also increase causing bigger losses than just the $770 per day due to TVOM!

TLDR: Get Rekt

769,GLPI," Firstly thank you for your critical response, it allows me to consider cetain aspects and ultimately improve.

1. That's a solid point you bring up, because indeed, the client base is currently lower than what it used to be, and thus a potential threath to GLPI.
2. Once again, solid point, I personally didnt look into the geographical locations with regards to natural disasters. Ultimately though, most REITs have many properties spread around the US with almost always a few of them in locations prone to natural disasters. The company was founded i 2013 which means they are still quite young therefore, it makes sense they havent yet gotten to own a casino in the gambling hotspots.
3. I guess simply by making sure the casino is always a hotel at the same time. because otherwise i would not see how they hedge against this rising change in betting behavior. And yes, for long term this is a valid threat.
4. For sure, there are many other casinos that look way better, yet how are you going to invest in those? Because im quite certain there not many other REITs focussing on casinos out there.
5. None, i live in Europe lol
6. Unfortunately i do not have a favorite, but generally speaking i like the more modern looking casinos.",Bm-Master,-2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mi68wr/gaming_and_leisure_properties_glpi/gt4i022/,0.06,0.833,0.106,0.7396
770,IRS," ""Most stock dividends meet the IRS definition of “qualified dividends,” so they get lower long-term capital gains tax rates. Most REIT dividends don’t qualify.
So the majority of REIT distributions are classified as ordinary income, which is taxable at your marginal tax rate.
However, some of your REIT distributions could meet the definition of qualified dividends. This happens when a REIT distributes a long-term capital gain on the sale of an asset or if the REIT itself receives a qualified dividend payment.

776,GME," I’ll make this easy for you, no math. If it opens flat you’re down another $2000; you’ll be able to sell the contracts around $10.50 or so, bid will be around $10 and ask will be around $11.  

Note: it’s highly unlikely that it will open flat. More likely that it opens up or down some.  For your options to remain flat you’ll want to see an open around $195, and you’ll lose more than $2500 on the open if it opens around $190.

777,GME, Depends on where GME opens on Monday. I figured these are the 4/9 $200 Calls.

780,LEAP," When people say roll them, they are saying that if you’re ok with the gambling aspect, there isn’t much wrong with selling and then repurchasing the same strike with a bit more time on it. You might end up with less contracts by rolling but you’re still in the game for a pop.  And if it doesn’t pop then you’ve still lost the money but the arcade game quarter lasts a bit longer.

I personally only buy LEAPS options. I really want the long term capital gains advantage on my winners so I hold just about everything for a full year or more. And the only way to do that with options is to get expirations more than a year out. That’s all LEAP means, the L is for long - an option with more than a year to work with.
