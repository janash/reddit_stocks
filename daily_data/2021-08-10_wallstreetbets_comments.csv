A lot of people (I tried to warn 'em), didn't notice the MCFE divvy announcement actually happen 2 weeks ago initially - stock already ran its' price since, wsb got in late.

ECVT announcement earliest was Aug 2nd, went under the radar before earnings last week. Look at the price action of this stock, it offered $100m in shares back in March, tripling its' then-float of ~55m. Didn't drop a penny below $14. It means people are long the company.

Company earnings posted growth, beat revenue despite higher losses. Sell off a portion of the business for 1.1b then pay half debt, some divvies, some remaining growth. Financially company looks solid.

But y'all don't give a shit about that, so just know that the stock shorts have to pull out today or they pay $3.20 per shorted stock and nobody wants to pay that.

Literally can't go tits up, get in before 5pm EST today. stock sitting at ~16.20 currently means this is valued at $13.00 and I'd chop my balls off if this stock falls from a divvy announcement of $3.20 which is TWENTY PERCENT (20%) of $15.75.

I've been keeping an eye on lvl II/volume on this ticker for a few hours today and there are huge exits happening all afternoon.

568,AMC," The reason popcorn had a resurgence is because of a quant strategy called pair trading 


Tons of hedge funds were getting squeezed in 2020 with the GameStop rally from 2.85 to 22 in Dec 2020 so they had to act.

Due to the tiny float in gme and their naked shorts and rehypothecated overexposure they couldn't cover, so they did the next best thing to eliminate the short exposure:

They searched for statistically correlated assets to game and went long those instead. This eliminates the negative delta exposure.

This works if the assets actually are correlated like coke and pepsi, less so if they just happen to fall down at the same rate like AMC and GME.


Why am I telling you all this? Because what this means, is that tons of big institutions like Susquehanna, citadel, wolverine, and more, who are proven long AMC holders and known short GME holders, will, once the correlation breaks, or the market tanks, or gme offers their dividend,  be forced to buy back GME, and therefore force liquidated out of AMC and the entire rest of the meme stock trash, the basket they've build through pair trading to anchor GME down.

583,AMC," I disagree that the securities were purchased to go long. AMC and others have also been sold short and the melt-ups started well before the December GME run.   


Go back and look at the stock chart for NEGG. Flatlined until October 2020. Melt-up to $5. Again up in January, April, and July. Each having a bigger melt-up. There's a ton of these all doing the same thing. I believe they've managed to cover some, specifically some MedChem stocks (can't name tickers due to under 1B cap), but not many. The stocks that are seeing bigger and bigger melts, like AMC, GME and NEGG, are definitely not covered yet.   


It doesn't matter what security you pick. Buy them all when they're at a local minimum (like right now) and then sell calls when the stock inevitably rockets as shorts cover and gamma ramps send prices to the stratosphere. Buy back the call on the drop, rinse and repeat.

The inverse can't be true. That would require gme long and AMC short, which would mean that gamestop would lead AMC in movements, which was only true for the original January spike.

588,GME," what im saying is that those were not short squeezes but pair trades. newegg is actually the perfect example. 

GME started running in july 2020 but really the hedgefunds knew in late april, after the strong bounce of 2.85 that they were toast.

so anyway, to continue shorting gme, they went long newegg, since they are sort of an online competitor. selling pcs and gaming periphery d2c. 


the course moves exactly opposite to gme for nearly two years, until the meltdown in january, and then again, almost perfectly anticyclical. 

the spike in octover 2020 is the last big dip in gme before the run to 483. april for gme is the bottom of the cup and handle, a last hurray before it ran up back to 350 again. and then of course in july is the post earning crater of gme... and the spike in egg.


I mean, it is so obvious once you actually sit down and look at it.


newegg is also not shorted, and is not being squeezed. it's owners are chinese billionaires, who own it more or less outright. no point in shorting a company that cant go broke.",jessejerkoff,7,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p1rllr/amc_my_second_fomo_of_the_day/h8fpz1o/,0.011,0.879,0.109,0.9736

* Digital transformation with tons of spending money, no debt and high brand value

* Incredible team of execs from Amazon, chewy, Microsoft, Zulily, etc.

* short squeeze

The main issue is that short positions have unlimited risk, which is the reason why the funds who were caught  out needed to offset the risk.


Look mate, I understand that this clashes with your preconceptions, but I've worked in finance myself and I know how the game is played. Pair trading is very common and this is clearly what happened and why this basket moves so coherent.

The only end I can see, is to eventually cover the short exposure, and that will mean GME goes to the moon and only GME. The only stock ever to be shorted to this degree.

We can’t look at NEGG last year because they changed their ticker, so I’m not sure what FTDs were then. BB has just as many FTDs last year as GME and AMC, relative to normal FTD amounts. 

There are many different shorted stocks and this whole argument about going long on these other meme stocks that keep going on runs, mostly through gamma ramps, seems quite absurd. Every single one of these shorted meme stocks was something set to fail, or was an Amazon competitor.",ChemaKyle,-2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p1rllr/amc_my_second_fomo_of_the_day/h8geq25/,0.068,0.877,0.055,-0.5175
595,AMC," that they can do. but only for so long.

artificially inflating the price of AMC is at best a zero sum game unless tons of apes fall for it. but even then, once that ebbs off, what you are left with is a totally removed security and no way out. 

at that point you might even take a loss at selling back.

during the run up, you can indeed use it to short even more, but that doesn't solve the original problem: the short of GME cant be covered. 

so yes, they can use it to kick the can down the road a bit, but not to get out.",jessejerkoff,5,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p1rllr/amc_my_second_fomo_of_the_day/h8folgb/,0.109,0.778,0.113,0.5304

A few years pass and they decide ""hey, those indians are so much cheaper than these americans"", layoff the department, and outsource to india. This time they keep 1 american to help them...

641,FB," taking the average of offers in 2020 is a horrible metric lol, all of their stock prices changed *dramatically* throughout the year, and many people on levels account for growth when they enter it (judged by looking at a bunch of individual records for well known positions like fb E5)

ie if you had 3 data points, 2 from facebook spring 2020 hires, 1 from pinterest, and they all entered on levels a few months after joining, it would be drastically different than if it were 2 facebook fall 2020 hires

at low levels you can make marginally more money hopping companies each year and getting lucky with well-timed grants but like.. i mean if youre really about TC you should be wanting to be senior+1 or senior+2

i think everyone agrees that its not reliable to do that at other companies (a staff at linkedin will get downleveld AF if they move to facebook etc) but if you goto those levels at FAANG all other companies will value it or even give you a level boost to move

(not to mention FB is the top entry for ""Principal"" (senior staff) in this list you just linked, at $895,000.)

642,TC," taking the average of offers in 2020 is a horrible metric lol, all of their stock prices changed *dramatically* throughout the year, and many people on levels account for growth when they enter it (judged by looking at a bunch of individual records for well known positions like fb E5)

ie if you had 3 data points, 2 from facebook spring 2020 hires, 1 from pinterest, and they all entered on levels a few months after joining, it would be drastically different than if it were 2 facebook fall 2020 hires

Hell interstates and highways weren't there for quite some time, people still rode horse and the train. The government building highways all over the place really pushed ICE cars to the forefront. Now they're moving onto EVs. These national projects will always be time consuming and costly, but I can't argue against this decision- it's actually a good thing. Yes, we do not have the power grid now capable of a project like this...similarly to the big ICE push the infrastructure needs to be developed. Adversity breeds creativity.

987,RKT," Just about any of the MREIT's are still about 20% down from their pre-pandemic values, and most of them should return to that value in time, but it won't until the pandemic really starts to wane and the eviction ban is lifted allowing companies to start reclaiming the homes they sold that are currently in default and then resell them to people that will actually pay their loans.

RKT is in a weird place where we don't really know what their true value was pre-pandemic, but if similar companies are any indicator - they're also 20% lower than where they should be, which says fair value might be in the low to mid 20's at this point.

But until the pandemic ends, expect choppy waters and buy the dips as they come and you'll probably come out ahead.
