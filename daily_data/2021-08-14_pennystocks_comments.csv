16,TTCF," **TTCF**
Tattooed Chef is a leading plant-based food company offering a broad portfolio of innovative plant-based food products that taste great and are sustainably sourced. Tattooed Chef’s signature products include ready-to-cook bowls, zucchini spirals, riced cauliflower, acai and smoothie bowls, and cauliflower pizza crusts, which are available in the frozen food sections of leading national retail food stores across the United States. Understanding consumer lifestyle and food trends, and a commitment to innovation, allows Tattooed Chef to continuously introduce new products. Tattooed Chef provides great-tasting, approachable, and innovative products not only to the growing group of consumers who seek to adopt a plant-based lifestyle, but to any of the “People Who Give a Crop™”.

Why Buy?

- TTCF is one of the very few participants in the plant-based consume cyclical segment. This market is only set for growth as the convergence of a number of structural trends drive global diets away from meat. It's important for TTCF bulls to be cognizant of these trends to fully assess the direction of the market Tattooed Chef aims to capture.

- TTCF's management had previously guided for full-year gross margin of 20% to 25% and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) of $2 million to $4 million. But now, management lowered guidance for gross margin to 16%-22% and guided for an adjusted EBITDA loss of $14 million to $17 million.

- TTCF Revenue is expected to grow by 41.30% on average over the next 5 years. This is a very strong growth coupled with the fact that ""emissions from plant-based foods are 10 to 50 times smaller than those from animal products. Meat and dairy also account for around 14.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Essentially, if the world is to meet its target of limiting global warming to “well below” 2C, radical changes in the global diet will be critical."" This implies that demand will only continue to increase.

Prices to look for: $16.14 - $17.58
TTCF was recently hovering around the $30 price level and is an interesting stock as it has the lowest amount of competitors in it's niche segment of plant-based food providers. What is valuable about TTCF is the extremely low float it maintains and how the smallest catalyst can send this stock soaring for double digit gains. Definitely watch TTCF closely in the coming week.",OfficerTruth,12,/r/pennystocks/comments/p46t7q/you_provide_the_ticker_ill_provide_the_analysis/h8wona1/,0.05,0.821,0.129,0.9815
