I‚Äôm not saying it won‚Äôt be 1 share of TRCH = 1 share of META. I‚Äôm saying we don‚Äôt know and that many people are throwing money at TRCH with very little understanding of the merger. They just see the hype and jump in.

When you buy 0.001 share, or whatever is is, of AMZN, you lock yourself into earning pennies on a 15% move, which if it happened, would be significant for such a large stock. You‚Äôd be better being all in on it, and at a time like this, it‚Äôs not a risky stock to hold if you consistently do a little research.

Spreading yourself thin like this will be better in maybe 6 months‚Äô time after you have kept adding to your portfolio and can own a more significant portion of the fractional shares. For now it‚Äôs just a high opportunity cost is all I‚Äôm trying to say.

730,VALE,"EDIT: Only after I finished I realized that I made an essay. 

Having studied Maritime business, I'm don't really understand why people are hyped on this stock (keep in mind I've been out since 2017, rusty on my knowledge, and probably won't return to the industry). Here's a few things you should know:

Consumerism will NOT affect this stock at all. T[hese are bulk carriers](http://castormaritime.com/fleet), meaning they carry things such as grains, ores, and other raw materials. This would mean something like the increase in the [US's agricultural trade with China](https://www.agriculture.com/news/business/near-record-us-ag-exports-seen-with-china-back-as-top-customer), or [the steel shortage](https://www.metalbulletin.com/Article/3965772/RESEARCH-Strong-demand-rising-materials-prices-underpin-bullish-Chinese-steel-market.html) could have an impact, but...

How these companies normally make money are by chartering out their ships to agricultural, energy, or mining companies. There are three types of charters and all of them are negotiated through a ship broker:

* Bareboat, which is normally a long term charter where the ship owner basically gives  with the owner not providing anything other than the ship itself, imagine like renting an apartment for a year. If these guys do bareboat charters, they will not be affected directly by the business done directly (judging by their website I don't think they do bareboat charters).
* Time charters, this is for a specific time period but unlike the bareboat charters, these are shorter terms and
* Voyage, normally for one or two ""voyages"" for a one time need, this is normally infrequent but normally gives the owners good returns, even if they normally have to upfront other costs such as crewing.  Payment is normally done either as a lump sum (one large payment) or as a per-ton basis, basically how much volume of material they shipped.

There's also a fuckton more involved in these charters, such as Laytime (the amount of time a ship is allowed to load/unload cargo), Demurrage (basically imagine getting charged parking tickets, but in ports), in which the charter party (the agreement between ship owner and charterer), and insurance costs, basically shipping is expensive as shit and they negotiate with the broker the terms.

Normally these chartering agreements are only published on websites behind paywalls like [tradewinds.com](https://tradewinds.com) and thus it's hard to tell which kind of charter they do.  The only way you can make a guess is by where their ships are positioned and  their movements. Normally if they seems to go to random places, they're on voyage charters. if they're going to set places, they're probably on time charters. Based off their [Magic Rainbow](https://www.vesselfinder.com/vessels/MAGIC-RAINBOW-IMO-9318591-MMSI-538009026) and [Magic Horizon](https://www.vesselfinder.com/vessels/MAGIC-HORIZON-IMO-9553062-MMSI-538008110) ships, they're probably on time charters, hell the Magic Horizon being at Shanghai Anchorage to me makes me feel like they don't have a charter for that ship at this time.

Personally though, unless I knew which charters they were undertaking, I would not invest in a bulk shipping company. The big reason why bulk shipping companies offer stocks is to pay for new ships, which is definitely needed as new ships are not cheap by any stretch of the imagination but they're not necessarily trying to constantly gather capital from the stock market. If something's on a long time charter with say, $VALE, then they'll probably have steady income, but I don't know if the shareholders will ever get it in return. If the price does moon, it will be related to commodities.

Tl;DR: Consumerism will NOT be the play with this, this will be a commodities play, but how ship owners make money is complicated and they're not necessarily on the stock market for gains, rather to offer stocks to get enough capital to build ships.

Interesting rise on price on TRX today. 

New management supposed to help the company. 

I believe they are a mining company dealing with Gold and based in Canada.",0.0,0.828,0.172,0.6597

774,ATOS,"There was a lot of hype surrounding a presentation today - so much so many thought Fauci would be on the zoom to endorse the nasal spray product that ATOS is working on. This was not the case. Although there were some promising results, people who were holding ATOS were expecting something revolutionary to be announced. Even right when the zoom session started people began to get nervous and started selling. The price steeply dropped to around $3 before going back to $3.20s (because people bought on the dip). But once the session was a few minutes in, it became clear that although promising, ATOS wasn't announcing something revolutionary, so people panic sold (including me). Considering the high today was $3.77 and I got out at $3.08 it was disappointing. However, I still made a large profit since my average share price was $1.74 and I also had 75 call contracts. Most stocks listed here are a buy the rumor sell the news type deal. In this case, many people thought it would keep going up to hit price targets of $5, $7.5, and even $12. But in retrospect, it would have been much better to get out at the high of the day.

&#x200B;

TLDR: Massive hype and expectation caused the stock to surge over the past few days. Today, as the zoom presentation was starting, people panicked which initially caused a steep drop which was then recovered due to people buying the dip. Once it became clear that nothing truly revolutionary was being announced, people panic sold which tanked the stock.

Hope this helps. Markets - penny stocks especially are extremely treacherous. Sometimes it's better to exit a position with a smaller profit than to hold for a potentially larger profit - which might actually cause you to lose money. As the saying goes, no one ever lost money on a smaller profit.",0.08,0.808,0.112,0.8817
775,ATOS,"Getting into a stock before it booms is the easy part, and normally everyone is on the same side. Getting out of it is the hard part. Short term traders won‚Äôt tell you to sell because if they‚Äôre telling you it‚Äôs time to get out, it‚Äôs probably too late. Everyone else is going to tell you to hold or buy more. I‚Äôve noticed that I‚Äôve been able to minimize risk by leaning more towards short term trading and taking out respectable profits early. It‚Äôs important to realize that gains are gains, nobody really knows what‚Äôs going to happen, and there will always be another ATOS.",0.03,0.836,0.133,0.8957
776,CEO,"The news was... misinterpreted by the community. It was good, but the majority of Reddit was under some impression that Dr Fauci was speaking on behalf of Atossa. When all it turned out to be was the CEO talking for 3 minutes, most panic sold because of the sudden realization that the past several days‚Äô pump was somewhat under false pretenses.",0.098,0.838,0.064,-0.5006
777,OVID,"Yea it‚Äôll bump back, short sellers are just making profits right now but the hype on atos hasn‚Äôt settled down yet. Hold and be patient, don‚Äôt let your nerves get to you. A whole hell of a lot of us think with fear rather than logic and it‚Äôs pretty logical for atos to bounce, now if the conference is over and the nasal spray does not seem to be considered as a tool for fighting COVID, then yes possibly sell all shares or some for profit and wait for better days. Don‚Äôt go off anyone‚Äôs word without doing your own research.",0.126,0.711,0.164,0.5789
