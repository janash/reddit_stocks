81,BB,"Again I‚Äôm really not the best person to give advice but no you can‚Äôt lose more then your initial purchase of the option. To be safe don‚Äôt let the contract expire, sell it prior to that.

Safest bet to start in my opinion is buy a call option that expires at least a week out. Figure out what price you think the stock will go to and buy an option with a break even price below your guess. If a stock opens green, wait to buy. The more volatile the market the more expensive the option is, as it settles down options should become cheaper assuming the stock doesn‚Äôt gain all day. 

I‚Äôve made the majority of my gains in options I bought after 12 or so and sold the following day in the morning when it‚Äôs volatile and expensive. This avoids you day trading as well if you don‚Äôt have $25k in your account. 

For example: on Friday I purchased the 1/29 $25 BB option for $.17 ($17) towards the end of the day. This morning all within the first hour it went to $1.5, $2.25, up to around $3.5 and back down.

134,DD,"I caution myself on CV-related stocks going forward, not this stock specifically (any CV related stock or supporter of), but the testing going on and reported numbers and how those may affect things going forward. Maybe there's nothing to this in the end, but I want to say this now in case this merits discussion.. because DD is what we do, right? We are allowed conversations here, so here is my conversation.

90% of the CV tests were not indicative of an active illness (picking up viral debris incapable of causing infection or being transmitted because the cycle threshold (Ct) of the PCR testing amplified the sample too many times)

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/29/health/coronavirus-testing.html

Labs in the United States were using a Ct of 37-40, and as of Dec, they are going as high as 40. 
""The Times report noted that the CDC‚Äôs own data suggested the PCR did not detect live virus over a Ct of 33""

https://academic.oup.com/crawlprevention/governor?content=%2fcid%2fadvance-article%2fdoi%2f10.1093%2fcid%2fciaa1491%2f5912603

On September 28, 2020, a study published in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases from Jaafar et al. had asserted, based on patient labs and clinical data involving nearly 4,000 patients, that a Ct of 30 was appropriate for making public policy. An update to the CDC instructions for PCR testing from December 1, 2020, still uses a Ct of 40. 

Jan 20th, 2021: WHO guidance Diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 states that careful interpretation of weak positive results is needed (1). The cycle threshold (Ct) needed to detect virus is inversely proportional to the patient‚Äôs viral load.

a high Ct value means you are highly unlikely to become ill or get anyone else sick in the absence of very recent exposure to an infected person. Dr. Fauci knew this in July when he said that tests with a Ct above 35 were likely picking up viral debris or dead virus. Even at a Ct of 35, the incidence of virus samples that could replicate is very low, according to Jaafar et al.

Now we happen to see 2 states (Cali/Mich) and 2 major cities (NY and CHI) walking back their CV lockdown policies, maybe that's coincidence, or the curve has flatten enough or maybe because they know that confirmed cases number is about to go way, way down- From 24m to 2.4m (per NYT). If that is true, and in those articles I don't see anything pointing otherwise, then perhaps the lockdowns get walked back, the need for as many solutions gets walked back, the need for testing kits, testing centers, a plus up in the fields directly working against CV get drawn down. 

Just a thought, this is as much DD as I have for now, it may be worth discussing, it may not be.

edit: this post isnt saying CV19 isnt vicious as a virus, it's saying that maybe the numbers of infected are highly inflated (10x) and because of that, there could be a large drawdown of resources/stocks/companies/programs/testing etc as a domino effect",0.071,0.86,0.07,-0.7504

Also - notice how certain hotbed lockdown areas are now walking back restrictions? Weird timing huh? Cali/NYC/Mich/Chi. Maybe they are aware of this news or maybe they had other reasons they didnt list in the articles I read. 

Other than that, in the US I can possibly attribute any large drops to consumer confidence dropping because of current EO's and a low confidence in the White House. People could be smartening up to foreign energy dependence once again causing a rift, how advertisers aren't going hard at the Superbowl this year because of a nation divided? 

If you didnt know about the SB advertisers dropping out and lower cost commercials and you didnt know about the Ct threshold being highly in question for covid testing.. diversify your news sources.


EDITS: 

**CV DD:**
90% of the CV tests were not indicative of an active illness (picking up viral debris incapable of causing infection or being transmitted because the cycle threshold (Ct) of the PCR testing amplified the sample too many times)

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/29/health/coronavirus-testing.html

Labs in the United States were using a Ct of 37-40, and as of Dec, they are going as high as 40. ""The Times report noted that the CDC‚Äôs own data suggested the PCR did not detect live virus over a Ct of 33""

https://academic.oup.com/crawlprevention/governor?content=%2fcid%2fadvance-article%2fdoi%2f10.1093%2fcid%2fciaa1491%2f5912603

On September 28, 2020, a study published in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases from Jaafar et al. had asserted, based on patient labs and clinical data involving nearly 4,000 patients, that a Ct of 30 was appropriate for making public policy. An update to the CDC instructions for PCR testing from December 1, 2020, still uses a Ct of 40.

Jan 20th, 2021: WHO guidance Diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 states that careful interpretation of weak positive results is needed (1). The cycle threshold (Ct) needed to detect virus is inversely proportional to the patient‚Äôs viral load.

a high Ct value means you are highly unlikely to become ill or get anyone else sick in the absence of very recent exposure to an infected person. Dr. Fauci knew this in July when he said that tests with a Ct above 35 were likely picking up viral debris or dead virus. Even at a Ct of 35, the incidence of virus samples that could replicate is very low, according to Jaafar et al.

Now we happen to see 2 states (Cali/Mich) and 2 major cities (NY and CHI) walking back their CV lockdown policies, maybe that's coincidence, or the curve has flatten enough or maybe because they know that confirmed cases number is about to go way, way down- From 24m to 2.4m (per NYT).


**Advertiser DD:** 
https://nypost.com/2021/01/24/many-super-bowl-advertisers-wont-have-commercials-this-year/

We've all seen the pipeline shutdown news (and Canadas lawsuit plus the native Tribes official response), foreign oil again (since pipeline), and EO's with related twitter/news backlash against stimulus payments and the womens rights.

I posted this in another subreddit, but this my  case for AMC:

\-This stock was more than 7$ before covid (And before GIGANTIC amounts of quantitative easing inflated the dollar)

\-Box office sales hit record highs in 2019

\-Streaming TV/Movies did not replace ""going to the movies"", box office sales hit records high in 2019 and watching movies at home had been a thing for years

\-AMC not going bankrupt this year as of yesterday, 900m loan secured

\-Large amount of movies ready to be released in the cinemas

\-People have spent the past year inside, will be eager to do ""social"" things

\-Short interest at 60%+, potential short squeeze happening

\-7$ calls expiring friday, IF price increases above 7$, this will take of like a fucking ICBM

\-Smaller competetion wiped out due to COVID

Even without the short squeeze, this is a buy and hold opportunity. Could easily go back to 7$.  TV didn't kill the cinema. DVD didn't kill the cinema. Streaming didn't kill the cinema.",0.022,0.789,0.189,0.9922
