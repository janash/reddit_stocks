1) halts (was at a 15%ish gain when HPR was halted this week...for the rest of both open *and* extended, and the it unhalted...at 20% *below* where I was at. Like...what the heck?). So my now current way to deal with halts is to set standing market sells on them as soon as they hit.

2) amount of capital: there's a certain...threshold of $ where low floats become dangerous because your entry and exit amounts actually change the indicators on the charts because you're having too much of an effect on the price, so I'm working on rapid firing multiple orders in order to ""stealth"" in and out of entries now.

21,HALO," Hey guys, I found this trendy stock in Germany and starting to do some research about it. Fundamental Research initiating coverage on Halo, and here are some highlights of the report:

Halo is a vertically integrated cannabis company with operations in Oregon, California, and Nevada, and internationally in Lesotho and the U.K. It is closing an acquisition of retail operations in Canada, which is subject to regulatory approval.

According to management, Halo has produced over 8M grams of oils and concentrates since inception, serving over 350 dispensaries/stores. This has historically been Halo’s revenue driver.

Currently expanding presence in California through three retail stores (currently in buildout stages). Management announced plans to introduce a functional mushroom line this year.

Internationally, Halo has expanded its portfolio by acquiring a licensed importer and distributor in the U.K. to connect its production-base in Lesotho to the European market.Raised C$30M through multiple private placements between November 2020 and February 2021. In January 2021, Halo reported record monthly sales of $3.7M. As a result of the recent acquisitions, and organic growth, we are expecting revenues to grow from $26M in 2020, to $84M in 2021.In 2020, the Oregon and California markets recorded cannabis sales of $1.1B and $4.4B, respectively, up 38% and 57% YoY. Halo is expected to commence sales in Europe this year, which will add diversification.

U.S. based cannabis stocks are currently trading at a discount over their Canadian peers. We expect this trend to change with federal legalization in the U.S., and anticipate HALO to directly benefit.",Good_vibes311,2,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/me0cql/check_out_this_cannabis_stock_halo_collective_inc/gsckzmr/,0.0,0.956,0.044,0.8779

32,GNUS," This week was basically a painful reminder to me to absolutely never humor the thought of buying any ticker after it's run for 2-3 days.

At least GNUS has a catalyst for me to look to next week. However the annoucement pans out, I will for sure close that position next week and then start focusing on making super reserved plays with the goal of getting 5-10 dollar upside per each. This market is so volatile with the corrections and market swings that trying hold something without a rock solid time frame for more than 2 days feels like a colossal gamble now so you best cash out the second you see even a hint of profit.
