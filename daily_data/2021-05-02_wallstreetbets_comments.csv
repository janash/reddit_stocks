Transfer reversals

Early assignment on options spreads

No, look motherfucker, if the market keeps going up that means being short is the contrarian play. Not to mention, short interest is at all time lows.

108,UK," Inflation, a significant real estate bubble, ramifications of enduring job loss, overestimation of how big the bounce-back will be following the “re-opening”, the fact that a huge chunk of the population has been carrying on in their economic activity as if there were no pandemic, material shortages for a myriad of reasons, from the the Suez crisis to the silicon shortages, and then the enduring threat of more dangerous COVID variants spreading. Some of the new variants have had mutations in their spike protein which may be vaccine resistant. Based on more dangerous variants we have seen in the UK and Southern California, what is happening in India may be indicative of what is to come. For historical context, the Spanish Flu stacked the most bodies in the later stages of the 2-year-long pandemic.

114,GME," 1). Markets crash when money thrown into it is at or near all time highs. The more removed we are from fundamentals of valuation the greater the reversion to the mean.

2). IBs aren’t trying to crash the market and Retail isn’t doing dick, this belief is the final stage of retardation that this casino market will endure. Shit is being bought up by passive indexes that are structured to just buy the same stocks regardless of valuation for retirement funds. The rest I assume, is getting bought up by some desperate firms that are in an Archegos/bill Hwang scenario. Which leads to the next bullet.

3). Record levels of margin debt as a percentage to S&P 500 will solve this manipulation especially now with the SLR exemption gone, taxes due second week of may, reopening, yields crushing upwards and inflation destroying growth and speculative stocks.

4). The fed printer bro magic I believe is largely a con narrative started to get more money to the craps table of the stock market. It’s perfect cover to justify the conditions being seen since last year and make a little sense when you start considering the amount of options gaming, swaps and leverage used in this market.

JPow said ""inflation will be temporary"".  There is really no such thing as temporary inflation.  Only in the sense that inflation can be runaway or temporary period of increasing prices.

This means it trades at a premium to NAV in periods of high demand and at a discount when their shareholders are trying to exit. I think the premium is a good barometer for sentiment. Time will tell.

I also disagree that buying GLD is materially different than owning gold.

252,PLTR," A month out on the option chain. For example, today is May 1st. So Monday at open I would go look at PLTR price, Lets say its $24. So, if I wanted to take advantage of the premium while locking in a lower price, I would go look at the June 4th puts on PLTR. June 4 2021 $24 Puts are trading around $225/contract right now.

So if you sold a Cash Secured Put at $24 for June 4th, and it gets exercised by the holder, you would have effectively bought 100 shares for $21.75 (24-2.25). Then, you can do the exact same thing again, but with calls, because now you own the shares. 

The goal is not to constantly have your options get exercised, but to collect premium. Selling puts in general tho is a solid way to start a position in a stock, assuming they're cash secured.

264,RKT," Lots of desperate bag holders ready to drop their shares and cause a drop at earnings is what I'm hearing. As someone who is long $UWMC I'm not as worried at what it will do at earnings as compared to a year or two from now. Will it spike and remain higher at earnings? Probably not, but I sure as fuck hope so 🤷‍♂️. What I can say though is that UWM is the #2 residential mortgage loan lender behind $RKT, and as of December UWM held a 34% market share. UWM provides it's loans through third party brokers which can further increase their market share over time through increased exposure, as opposed to $RKT which has a direct to consumer approach. (Don't get me wrong, I'm also long $RKT and not hating on their business model). UWM and RKT have both implemented millions in recent years in technology to increase the ease of use to their services and streamline their processes. UWM holds an operating margin of 72% currently and a profit margin of 67% so they have plenty of free cash flow on hand. Median analyst price targets for the next year are at $11/share.

Will $UWMC be added to the Russell 2000 inclusion list this time around? Who knows? Most people seem to think this is the case, but they also thought the same thing last time.

Regardless, the single digit P/E boasted by UWM and RKT is very attractive to me currently and shows lots of room for upside in the future.",Gooch707,0,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n394cl/uwmc_earnings_play/gwoxzby/,0.041,0.775,0.184,0.9918

276,PSFE, I am relatively bullish on PSFE in the long run but am just accumulating a small (500) share position at these levels. I think they *should* post a good quarter. But their growth outlook for the next few years is just not that exciting so when people say “why are they undervalued vs SQ?” the answer is that the company is predicting 10% annual rev growth which is not anywhere near what other highly valued fintechs are putting up. The biggest overhang is that it’s a SPAC and Blackstone and CVC will almost certainly monetize some of their stakes through a secondary before year end. Before that happens and lockups expire institutional investors are going to stay wary thus any near term rally will likely sell off.,Verb0182,6,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n2vcjj/psfe_long_yolo_earnings_play/gwo80e6/,0.025,0.827,0.148,0.9513

402,DD," Completely agree. There are a few anti-obesity drugs going through trials right now that are showing huge potential. There’s a myriad of health problems, and costs associated with obesity. Obesity is a problem that’s not going away, and is growing (no pun intended). 

Cosmetics is a super interesting one. When we think about cosmetics in medicine we typically associate it with plastic surgery. What we often don’t think about though are things like Botox, and Kybella that are mainly outpatient. These are huge revenue generators, and typically less risky than the procedure it’s replacing. Kybella is a perfect example. It’s an injectable drug that eliminates double chin. The risks associated with it are lower since you essentially remove surgical complications compared to liposuction, and anesthesia. Plus, it’s cheaper for the patient. The industry as a whole is a behemoth that is frequently slept on, and there really isn’t a way to invest in a good plastic surgeon. There are a lot of really interesting studies being published that have huge commercial potential. Particularly in terms of skin care, and wrinkles. They’re very early on, but I keep a close eye on them.
