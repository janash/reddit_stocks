They all pretty much compete in the same space. AWS pretty much had first to market which is where they gained their foothold and their innovation has put them ahead of their competitors pretty regularly.

Azure.... is enterprises focused, but good lord their products are confusing as hell, the UI is a mess and was constantly changing, and their data storage costs were stupidly more expensive (at least 5 years ago, it could have changed) 

There are other niche cloud providers but those are the big three. IMO, Google feels more like a toy and isn’t robust enough. Azure still acts like their services are on-prem and aren’t innovative enough to keep up. AWS isn’t going to be toppled any time soon.

Edit: I did compare modern aws to azure, but I haven’t had a reason to use it and I’m sure as hell not doing it on my free time. Microsoft is doing good things in the open source space (which I use every day) but I’m not rushing to move my infrastructure over to them.

>Take a look at Goldman Sachs’ research from February 1st 2021 (yes, after the prospectus was published).

Dude, I work on the instituional sellside as an M&A advisor, and protip: if you're trying to see if a forward valuation assumption (e.g. EBITDA) is reflected in the current valuation, why would you look at research, rather than to see if CRSR is currently trading. 

Factset is showing enterprise value of ~$4.1bn, which if you're using management's guidance (***which should be taken with a grain of salt until you see audited financials/ER since they have a reason to be overly optimistic***) on EBITDA of $200, implying a 20x - 21x multiple. 

Granted, gaming isn't my coverage sector, but 20x seems about in line with what LOGH is trading at. Also, Factset is also showing consensus research EBITDA median estimates of around $200mm for 2020E. Looks like it's been sitting at that $200 mark since mid December - kind of tells me that the market is thinking the same thing that I am: ""You've increased your sharecount +30% YoY, increasing your cost of capital / creating volatility with how the market is choosing to value you on a bottoms-up approach, so you've got cause to be overly optimistic on FY EBITDA expectations to help your valuation as much as possible from a top-down approach. Ergo, I'm not sure if I'm going to grant you the valuation uplift from management's EBITDA guidance, especially when you consider that they've engaged in a lot of M&A recently and there's not much clarity on realizing those synergies in 2020E, relative to integration costs/cash outflows""

Now from the games I follow, not so many pros are using Corsair hardware, I think they sponsor 6 teams currently, and are taking sponsorship applications, FC Shulke (yes the over 100 year old German football or ""soccer"" team) is currently sponsored by them according to their site, but this also states they sponsor ROX Tigers, who disbanded in 2018 and have a rebranded roster who aren't sponsored by them.

171,CRSR," Ok, thanks. Going to walk myself through this just so I'm clear...

So today you bought 3000 shares at 41.66 for almost 125k.

You sold 30 contracts for $250 ($2.50/share) with a strike price of $55. That's the $7,500 in premiums.

Then, as you said:

> If CRSR expires in 16 days above $55 a share (the strike price for the options contracts I sold) I will sell them the shares I own for $55 a share

Meaning that you're possibly missing out on some profit. If the prices leaps to $75/share that's $60k of possible profit you miss out on by being able to sell them yourself.

>  If CRSR is below $55 a share in 16 days the contracts expire worthless and I make all the premium from the contracts I sold as profit

But, if somehow the stock falls more than $2.50/share (and you sell), you've lost the same amount you earned through the premiums.

I can see why *buying* calls are safer for your investment - less to lose, more to gain.

But I'm not seeing what the benefit is for selling calls. If things go well you're limiting profit to the premium only, and if things go bad you're stuck with 3k shares and could possibly lose a lot.

What's the upside?

EDIT: Thinking more, I guess you'd also be getting the difference, $55-$41.66 per share if they exercised. So about $40k in profit I didn't consider.",viveleroi,3,/r/investing/comments/lbnqg1/crsr_corsair_dd_the_q4_results_are_basically/glws2mo/,0.084,0.742,0.175,0.9727

182,CRSR," If you sell a call, you have sold the right to purchase shares from you to somebody else.

Let's say you and I agree to a day (the expiry, usually a Friday) and a price (the ""strike"").  You will sell me a call and I will buy your call.  I now hold the right to purchase.  That means you will sell me 100 shares of CRSR on (just for example purposes) Friday, February 19th for $50 if it's in the money.  It doesn't matter what the price is or how much higher it goes.  I hold the ""option"" to buy those off you for $50 at any time.

Of course, if CRSR is not at least $50, I'm not going to exercise my option.  I'm probably not going to exercise it early either for reasons we don't need to get into now.  I'm also not going to hold until expiry in most cases--I'll sell it to somebody else with deeper pockets to do that instead.  However, if it's $50 at market closing on the 19th, *somebody* will exercise that option.  Somebody will own that option and come collect the shares from you, giving you $5000 in the process.

Pull up this link: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CRSR/options?p=CRSR

That's the option chain for CRSR this Friday.  That's what these options are currently trading for on the open market.  You will sell me that $50 call option for the 19th for $3.60 per share.  That means you get paid $360 right off the bat.  That money is yours no matter what.  Go buy a beer and more stocks with it.

Now, I'm making a bet that the price will move in my direction and hopefully even clear $50.  If it does go to, say, $60 at expiry, the holder of that option gets cheap stocks, right?  They're coming to get $6000 worth of stocks from you for the low price of $5000.  That's the holder of the option's side of the deal.  If it's OTM at expiry, too bad, so sad.  They blew $360, but they tried making a bet.  You win some, you lose some.

Let's look at your side now as the person who sold the call.  You made $360, we know that.  If it finishes out-of-the-money, you like that.  You took that $360 and didn't have to provide any shares (because I wouldn't exercise my option below $50, obviously).

If it finishes ITM, you owe me shares.  This is why it is so important to ONLY SELL COVERED CALLS.  Worst case scenario with an ITM covered call is that somebody reaches into your account and takes your shares, leaving you the money: $strike X 100.

Worst case scenario with a naked call is infinite loss (or, more accurately for us, loss until bankrupt).  That's because there is no limit to how high a stock can go.  If you owe me 100 shares for $50 and the price moves to $150, you have a bit of a problem, don't you?  You have to go out and acquire 100 shares at $150 each and give them to me for the low price of $50.",PlayFree_Bird,15,/r/investing/comments/lbnqg1/crsr_corsair_dd_the_q4_results_are_basically/glwhned/,0.072,0.851,0.077,-0.5439
183,CRSR," I bought in this morning and sold for a small profit. The bid/ask spread and volatility is tremendous compared to similarly priced stock.

Given that CRSR is a recent IPO, it's likely they won't pay dividends for several years or even decades as they look to grow. So unless your timeline is a decade or more, you're basically gambling on investor sentiment in the near future.

CRSR could consistently beat earnings over the next 10 years, but still be trading for less than they are today if investors decide that their growth wasn't as high as they were expecting, or that future risks are high.

My biggest concern is buying in, and then the price tanks to $20 after their 2021 growth is less than expected, and stays there if they fail to see growth.  Then you're stuck with a 50% loss that's deadweight and not generating any income for a decade. This happened to a lot of people with tech growth stocks in 2000, even quality ones that were profitable.

I think we look at this different ways. You're looking at upside potential, I'm looking at downside potential. My portfolio is mostly positioned to be resistant to market volatility while still having substantial upside.

188,GME," I’ve enjoyed reading these posts.  I feel relatively safe in my index funds and ETFs, but did get FOMO on GME.  I was in for 90 average and out for 230 so managed to over double my money.

At one point in pre-trading I was up 6x.  I stared at the chart for a long time at just under 4x.  Had an awful feeling over the weekend after Thursday killed the momentum and decided to get out on Monday.  Getting out was one of the best investing decisions I’ve ever made, but $1000 memes had me sticking around too long.  I’ve learned a lot over the last 2 weeks, including that the system is stacked against me and, as sad as it is, I need to be happy with what I have. 

I can’t believe people are still in it tbh.  There is no ‘middle finger to the hedge funds’, if anything it’s the complete opposite.

211,GME," I for one appreciate continuing your breakdown, so thanks! I'm a relatively smart guy in most of my life except finance/investment and i know enough to recognize after Thursday/ Friday the situation had changed already and there were too many factors influencing the price way outside my knowledge base for me to make any kind of rational decisions.

I let FOMO take hold after setting up my brokerage account took too long and just wanted to get in before the squeeze as it was already happening. I recognized over the weekend I had bought into a position with just too much risk to tolerate and had to prioritize minimizing the loss. It's been a painful lesson exiting, but I won't lose the roof over my head or go hungry anytime soon. GME may never be replicated again, and I for one have have become a sliver more jaded when it comes to the mechanisms available for big money to manipulate, but what little I understand points to flaws in our financial system as a whole and some interesting effects of financial motivations of brokerages, clearing houses, etc. 

There's definitely going to be a lot of bagholders over emotions that aren't hitting the wealthy class like people think they are. I doubt I'll be a trader anytime soon, but I've learned a lot about trading and investing after putting it off all my life, I lost a gamble I walked into with eyes open but the only way to ever get better at this without putting my future family in the poor house is to learn the lessons you can from this.

222,SI," Is it possible what we were calling “short ladder attacks” was in actuality the hedge funds covering their positions and strategically making it look like “market manipulation?”

Would the duration of the “short ladder attacks” be consistent with the short ratio and thus meaning they’ve slowly unwinded and at this point mostly covered without anyone being able to pick up on it?

Also what are your thoughts on the market being down as a whole today (despite receiving good news on the stimulus bill, covid vaccine and somewhat good news in tech). Could it be hedge funds closing positions on other stocks to get the capital needed to cover their positions on GME? Did we see that at the end of day on the 28th and the 29th?

Last question, if hedge funds did cover on Friday, at a share price of roughly 250, wouldn’t that have been a serious problem for them? I think we’re all confused if the SI / S3 % of float numbers are accurate right now. But even if the majority has covered, wouldn’t they still have taken a huge hit at that price (possibly bankruptcy)?

237,GME," I'm not even going to be that disappointed over losing a couple hundred about this. I had gone into GME with the goal of being able to say that I was a part of it, and the objective of leaving with a nice wad of (digital) cash in my pocket was secondary. 

Internet history and archival is going to be so fascinating in the years to come, since it's so easy to see the public's reaction to major events on such a massive scale, whereas in the past you were always subject to the constraints of print media and later on more limited video recordings.

240,GME," I mean... they disabled the buy buttons. How is everyone here not utterly sickened by that? Its fucking unheard of. Etoro forced people to sell automatically after a 20% loss when they werent on margin, there was a coordinated media campaign to pump and dump silver and blame it on reddit... y'all are sitting here patting yourself on the backs for not buying into a company which realistically, will probably be a good long term hold once volatility calms down but isnt this all fucking absurd? How the fuck can anyone, as a retail buyer, have any faith in the market anymore? If you hit it big on something else, what's to stop them from just saying ""nope, were gonna short that and shut off the buy button again because risk or liquidity or something I dunno, fuck you. Thats our money now. Dont like it? Too fucking bad.""

Rigged doesnt even begin to describe it. I bought a very small amount of GME after they shut off the buy because I figured the free media attention and backlash and imminent arrests for market manipulation would force their hands... but nothing happened. At all. It's still limited buys only. Fuck me for having faith in the American people, I guess. Should've known better.

 I'm asking, seriously, how do any of you have any faith in the market right now? The media lies to push bullshit market moves which their bosses do the opposite of and profit massively, and a million paid bulls and bears for every stock are always on standby to pump and dump stocks at will. There is no information being put out there by people who actually want to help inform retail traders. Especially now that WSB is really just GMEStreetBots.

260,GME," I agree with this.  My thought is that the long-term fundamental value of GME is very arguably higher than even today's price, though it will take time to get there.

In addition to the shares I own, I actually created a potential position by selling cash-secured April 40 puts for $10 back when GME was around $37 if I remember correctly.  If they execute, great--I get GME shares at an effective price of $30.  If not, I made some cash on the trade.

I've found that for me, cash-secured puts is a way to manage an entry into a stock at what I think is not just fair value, but great value with asymmetrical upside potential.  I find that more often than not if it's a stock I like I get itchy trigger fingers and buy at current price even if I think it would be a better to try to wait for a pullback.  Writing a put basically forces me to stick to my planned entry price, and if it escapes without me then I don't feel too terrible because I at least made the cash from the put expiring OTM.

277,GME," In their defense, you can kind of see an evolution of sorts in investment thesis if you look at the sentiment of posts over time:

During the initial run-up, it was ""play the short squeeze because SI was like 140%!"", which is a perfectly reasonable gamble (note I'm not saying it's an investment) on the structure of the market. 

As the price spiked, it became ""stick it to the man and make some money thru wealth transfer because 140% SI!"".

Now, with price decreasing, the thesis is turning to ""GameStop turnaround value play makes it worth $300/share!""

283,DD," Sounds like we were in a similar position, I was up around £20k at one point too, I did think a lot about selling (annoyingly I had a sell limit at 500 for ages but it never quite hit that) as that's nearly a year's salary for me, but I decided ultimately a year's salary won't change my life, the potential for much much more would. So I was gambling really.

Sounds silly but another part of the reason I didn't sell was because I felt like I would letting everyone else down if I did. 

I really really hope people don't get too hurt by this, lots of wild stories in WSB and I hope a lot of them were exaggerating or joking. I do think there's still potential for \*something\* to happen, but even if it's another short squeeze it won't reach the heights we saw last week. That was another reason I got out. Potentially selling at 150 vs selling at 100 wasn't worth the extra hassle of constantly watching the ticker, trying to keep on top of any news that might cause it to wildly swing either way, etc.

I do agree with a lot of the DD that was done for GME, and I do agree it was initially undervalued.

296,SI," The recovery on Friday looked promising enough for many to not panic immediately. And also, until the explanations about liquidity problems came out it was very plausible for many that Robin Hood restricting trades was intentional market manipulation, which not only added to the narrative (if they covered, why would they need to do this?), but also made it personal for many, i.e. they kept buying and holding out of spite.

To me the hype curve looks plausible exactly as it is. Many naysayers already saw it coming on Friday, sure. Just as they saw a crash coming at 20 or 120. There are always smartasses who claim everything will fail until they're right. Just as there were people who had blind faith because they wanted to believe. And amidst these extremes there were many that had plausible explanations for what was going on and based their actions on those. Hence, only when it really continued to fall each day and the SI was reported to be lower, more people began to doubt a (second) squeeze is going to happen.

Some of the wiser people were around, but the dialogue changed so quickly that good advice was absolutely destroyed.

People exiting positions or taking in massive profit would have really been great. I am still making a profit myself, but I could have made much greater profit had I exited a few shares here and there.

The funny thing is, none of the veterans at WSB actually use Robinhood or any of the meme brokers. That was part of the joke. Experienced investors or traders will have more money than the federally insured limits and they would be concerned about the risk of the broker itself going bankrupt because they would potentially lose their money.

And honestly, up until Thursday GME was going to squeeze hard, it was only when retail trading apps started to buckle that we lost.

Mistakes were made with GME.  If you accurately identify where/why you went wrong, then it's an opportunity to learn and make better decisions in the future.

In this case, I think the mistakes/lessons are:

* RH limiting share purchasing significantly lowered demand.  That was a warning sign that the long side wouldn't be able to lock up enough float to force an infinity squeeze

* The whales on the long side were never going to squeeze Melvin/Citadel to the breaking point.  The systemic risk was too great.  The Hedges trading back and forth that everyone though were Short Ladders was probably the long whales cashing out.  The ortex and S3 numbers were correct.  The shorts covered by buying from the long whales.  The long whales didn't care about leaving retail holding the bag.

* Retail investors working together do have the power to move markets at the expense of hedge funds (GSE rose 4000% on a short squeeze that cost short HFs billions) - and that will present opportunities in the future.

320,AMC, If its in the news you lose. I bought AMC on January 11th using $100 that I had from direct deposit bonus deal in early 2020. I purchased AMC using SOFI app. I simply selected stocks that were under $10. I had no idea AMC would be a hit. I purchased 10 AMC stocks on January 11th and this was well before the stock got national attention. I sold the 10 stocks as soon as the price increased from $2.xx to $15.xx. So remember once a stock gets lots of media attention it becomes a laughing stock.

That's not really the question on a short squeeze.  The question is how many retail investors does it take to lock up a large enough percentage of float to trigger the squeeze?

When shares are cheap and the total number of shares are low, this can be achieved.  Both of these were true in the beginning with GME. Retail likely did play a major role by inflating the price of the stock and by convincing Melvin et al. that a squeeze wasn't a real threat.",SourerDiesel,2,/r/investing/comments/lb82we/lost_1500_investing_in_meme_stocks_in_a_6_days/glu4x4y/,0.056,0.793,0.151,0.8603

I’m not gonna say I’m clairvoyant here but market manipulation at the broker level to destroy but pressure *and* sentiment of a fast-rising stock doesn’t seem like something most people usually plan for when making decisions.

If these meme stock pump and dumps succeeded in destroying the stock market and dollar value (not good for the small guys, by the way), bitcoin could benefit.

382,AMC," About 10 years ago when I was a couple years out of college I was heavily invested in two biotech stocks.   I had about $4000 invested (which was a lot for me back then) and they were worth about $12,000 at their peak.  These were penny stocks I piled into under $1 and had thousands of shares.  Both had Phase III FDA trials approaching, and I was a member of a message board where I spent hours reading up on the science behind the cancer drugs that were being developed by these two companies.  I attended all the earnings calls and investor presentations.  Both companies were bleeding cash and had terrible balance sheets, but I didn't pay attention to boring things like that.  Dozens of posters were pumping the shares, and there were so many posts about ""back the truck up"" and ""to the moon!"" any time there was a dip in the share price.  The CEO's were upbeat during presentations.  I was pretty confident this was a sure thing and I was going to see at least $500K when the drugs were approved, if not more.  


One day I woke up to news the phase III trial had failed and the FDA did not grant approval to proceed.  $10K evaporated overnight.  I was sick to my stomach.  I was in the red about 50%.  I sold both stocks in the days that followed when I realized they were not going to recover, one at a huge loss and the other with about an $800 gain.  Even though it hurt like hell for a while, I learned a valuable lesson about never taking stock advice at face value and always doing my own DD.

394,GME," > I don’t think it’s fair to say that the efforts of those long GME were doomed to fail from the start; their thesis was pretty reasonable, imo. If it weren’t for Robinhood halting buys I’m pretty sure the last 4 days would be significantly different.

I'm of two minds about this: I think that trading halt black-swan-within-the-black-swan that is GME the last week is at least a defensible argument for why the short squeeze investment thesis broke down. That doesn't necessarily absolve them of trying to hold on to the thesis once trading halts and price dives gave the shorts a chance to quietly cover.

Significantly up compared to other investment opportunities, or even some market ETFs? I really don't think so. 

Between COVID and HBO Max streaming all of WB's blockbusters, I think movie theaters will have a HUGE uphill battle. Might take them a few years to transition to a boutique or premium experience to make the same amount of money from fewer customers.

BB and NOK are similar to Kodak in my eyes. They missed the boat, and have pivoted to fill a small tech niche. There's really not a lot of money to be made here for either company. Note with BB no tech, security, or auto investors were touching the stock prior to the run up. Even their CEO was scratching his head.

451,UK," It depends what you're after. I'm in a few stocks that I've held for around 9 years. I researched the shit out of them, liked the cut of their gib and bought in.

It's gone up, it's gone down, it's gone up, it's gone down. Right now, I'm down about 85%, but because it's a long hold, I don't care. The stock I'm in should increase two fold once their drilling ship god's operational and they manage to get one of their deep wells running. That might take another two years for that price to be realised.

Also, in the UK, a trading company releases something called an RNS on the London Stock Exchange which is legally required to give certain news updates. That's what I check up on to make sure things are going in the right direction.

453,DD," So, the most basic thing that I look for are any indicators of fraud or corporate malfeasance. Not generally a big deal with blue chips, but if I have a specific concern I stay away. 

From there you should familiarize with the basics of financial reporting. You don't need to go overboard with that to start, but you need to know enough to evaluate if a company's financials make sense for where they are in their lifecycle. If they've been around for 20 years but their P/E is 1000 or N/A, do I really think they'll ever be profitable enough to matter? Maybe, but I'll need to see something to explain that number. A new growth company that's not spending on R&D or PP&E could also be alarming. 

And then you should know a bit about the business. You don't need to know everything about every industry, and it's fine to make small plays all over the board, but don't sink big money into an industry you don't know anything about. You should learn a bit about their competitors, whether they're trying to break in or defend incumbency, if they have any strategic advantages or weaknesses, etc. 

But ultimately, you're trying to guess at the future. You don't know the future and you never will. Diversify (and you can do that through things like ETFs while making smaller trades of specific stocks), stay humble about your knowledge, and use your DD to make sure you're staying out of obvious bad ideas rather than to try to hit a home run on every at-bat.

458,DD," Will probably get crucified for saying this here - WSB was in fact a great sub if you wanted to make risky bets and learn.

WSB has now turned into a shitty meme sub; with it and reddit in general, seen as THE place for pump-n-dump.

464,GME," I caught the train on GME relatively early. My initial investment was at $20 with I think 5 shares. Quickly sold that cause I started getting worried and when I saw it rising still I bought back in at $60 so still relatively early. I felt invincible at this point, WSB was gaining traction on social media, literally millions flocking into it, celebrities, politicians, traders all cheering for us. I saw a peak at 900% and still held. 

I will absolutely admit I lost my original vision as to why I invested in this company and it was strictly because I felt the change of board was going to be big. I was planning on sitting on it for the year but it turned into a get rich quick with social media jumping in. Being a new investor I learned so much from this like you said. In the end I mad 200%. My dad and I regularly talk about investing and I wish I had listened when he said ""Anything after this point you're just getting greedy"". 

Live and learn I guess. Fun ride, I'm still in but hurts knowing I could have made more earlier. I guess my main point with all this is we saw how fast it turned from ""RC Ventures backing"" to ""Were gonna be rich"". A lot of people got too emotional and that was a massive part but also too many people like me that drank the Kool-Aid and just didn't see a downward trend anywhere in sight.

471,GME," GME is a gamble. 98% of my portfolio is quality long term investments. Some folks will say 10% should be on speculation and gut trades, but honestly just buying and holding good companies long term will pay off. 

But also, having a small allocation for Hail Mary and “but what if” is totally worth the risk, but you need a strategy to follow and consider it your gambling fund. Personally, my yolo investments are where I track the gains. When i can sell off half or even less to cover my initial gamble, I do it. Then I’ve recovered my 2% and what comes of stocks like GME are just gravy on top.

For GME I took half the gains from one other YOLO and pocketed the rest. I’m currently $1k on on GME because I do think they are worth more than what they were worth. I think $80 is a good price target, before the C levels were announced. It’s GameStop. They are global. The pandemic will not kill them and now they have solid C level to bring the company around.

\--

Let me start by saying I LOVE what Reddit accomplished by attacking greedy shorts and redistributing some wealth. Was happy to participate and it was beautiful to see.

With that said, there's so many new investors coming in without understanding the situation, and who are getting burned and turned off of investing quickly. The reality is GME was heavily shorted for a reason - it's a dying business as games go digital, and it will continue to lose money until they are potentially insolvent. Regardless, catching the shorts with two hands in the cookie jar was brilliant. And there might be another squeeze ahead for all we know. But at some point, GME will return to fair value which at most is around $15/s to $20/s, so SOMEONE has to be left holding the bags when those pop.

In other words, you've got a chance at some growth, but the downside is still about 80% from here, maybe more. So if you've got extra money to throw around, by all means keep at it. But if you don't have the luxury of playing with money you don't need, and wouldn't be ok with 80% downside, the question becomes ""now what?""

Well we have a super inflated market, so patience and cash are incredibly valuable commodities for when an inevitable correction arrives. But that doesn't mean there isn't great value out there. And it also doesn't mean there aren't stocks that have the upside of GME while also having the fundamental value to limit their downside. Here I'll list a few of my favorite beaten down stocks with massive potential growth. My previous picks for high growth in my portfolio were SunPower (+800%), Magnite (+694%), Enphase (+4,200%), Redfin (my biggest holding, up 600%), Fiverr (+946%), AMD (+629%) and Invitae (+524%). Another was Carvana, but I sold at about $18 once I doubled so I don't even want to look where it is now...

So what's next on the list? I'd love to hear what other people are thinking, but here's the high growth I'm buying into right now:

&#x200B;

1. **Glu Mobile (GLUU)** \- Mobile Gaming Company. Great value, good balance sheet, overshorted, rapidly growing industry, cheaply valued compared to peers, popular line of recurring revenue games plus new developments sparking growth (including Disney Partnership). Top line info:
   1. Market Cap = $1.56b
   2. Short Interest: 12.85%
   3. Healthy Balance Sheet: Net Cash Position of $365m
   4. Trading at 3x forward sales, compared to peers like Skillz trading at 30x forward sales
2. **Vivo Cannabis (VVCIF) -** We all know cannabis has been moving up in the U.S. after the election, but there's still some tantalizing value north of the border in a beaten down stock that is is closing in on turning on a profit, and has a fantastic product line that continues to sell of the shelves. They've been dominating the Ontario concentrate market and have a foothold in multiple avenues that would spark enormous growth including a beverage development deal and a pending EU-GMP certification that will expand them into Europe while many others fight over the U.S. space. Some additional helpful info:
   1. Market Cap = $54m
   2. Recently paid down debt at a discount and don't owe anything until 2023 now
   3. Had an expectedly down Q3, but in Q4 they completed their biggest harvest ever and the stock's volume is picking up quick as it leads up to earnings this month.
   4. Price target of $0.70 from Clarus Securities
   5. Last CEO stepped down, facing criticism for the SP being so much lower than fundamental value (something I target in great value buying opportunities)
   6. From a recent SA article (""Buy a Significantly Undervalued Stock Ready to Turn a Profit): ""it is the book value that jumped out at me the most. VIVO Cannabis is a company on the verge of profitability with a book value that is 4x the current stock price. Given these factors, I am very bullish on VIVO Cannabis. I expect the company’s next few quarters to report positive earnings. And, since there is not a lot of liquidity in a company such as VIVO Cannabis’ stock, there is likely to be a sharp increase upwards in the stock’s price. In the beginning of the year, the company’s stock was double what it is today, trading at \~$0.20 per share. However, I believe that eventually, possibly by the end of next year, the company’s stock will trade above its book value. I am targeting $0.60 per share by the end of next year.""
3. **Baozun (BZUN) -** The Shopify of China, at a massive discount. A company trading for less than it was a year ago despite enormous potential.
   1. Market Cap: $3.04b
   2. Short Interest: 19%
   3. ""Baozun has 260 brand partners including **Nike**, **Microsoft**, and Philips, and that figure is up from 223 the year before and 95 in 2015, showing the company is quickly growing its corporate customer base.""
   4. Revenue growth 20%+
   5. An investment into the rapidly growing Chinese e-commerce market. Trading at a solid discount even after today's gains due to uncertainty in the Chinese market. If you're wondering the true potential of this company, just take a look at Spotify's charts from the past few years.

&#x200B;

And that's it for now - 3 high growth overly-shorted stocks that I would confidently invest in for 2021, who's breakouts are imminent with massive potential looming. Of course, as always, **do your own due diligence**. I've been fortunate to have had great investing success in the recent years, but I've also missed the mark at times so please research, follow the stocks, buy dips as opposed to runs, and most importantly don't ever invest anything you can't afford to use.

Regardless, catching the shorts with two hands in the cookie jar was brilliant. And there might be another squeeze ahead for all we know. But at some point, GME will return to fair value which at most is around $15/s to $20/s, so SOMEONE has to be left holding the bags when those pop.

In other words, you've got a chance at some growth, but the downside is still about 80% from here, maybe more. So if you've got extra money to throw around, by all means keep at it. But if you don't have the luxury of playing with money you don't need, and wouldn't be ok with 80% downside, the question becomes ""now what?""

Well we have a super inflated market, so patience and cash are incredibly valuable commodities for when an inevitable correction arrives. But that doesn't mean there isn't great value out there. And it also doesn't mean there aren't stocks that have the upside of GME while also having the fundamental value to limit their downside. Here I'll list a few of my favorite beaten down stocks with massive potential growth. My previous picks for high growth in my portfolio were SunPower (+800%), Magnite (+694%), Enphase (+4,200%), Redfin (my biggest holding, up 600%), Fiverr (+946%), AMD (+629%) and Invitae (+524%). Another was Carvana, but I sold at about $18 once I doubled so I don't even want to look where it is now...

So what's next on the list? I'd love to hear what other people are thinking, but here's the high growth I'm buying into right now:

&#x200B;

1. **Glu Mobile (GLUU)** \- Mobile Gaming Company. Great value, good balance sheet, overshorted, rapidly growing industry, cheaply valued compared to peers, popular line of recurring revenue games plus new developments sparking growth (including Disney Partnership). Top line info:
   1. Market Cap = $1.56b
   2. Short Interest: 12.85%
   3. Healthy Balance Sheet: Net Cash Position of $365m
   4. Trading at 3x forward sales, compared to peers like Skillz trading at 30x forward sales
2. **Vivo Cannabis (VVCIF) -** We all know cannabis has been moving up in the U.S. after the election, but there's still some tantalizing value north of the border in a beaten down stock that is is closing in on turning on a profit, and has a fantastic product line that continues to sell of the shelves. They've been dominating the Ontario concentrate market and have a foothold in multiple avenues that would spark enormous growth including a beverage development deal and a pending EU-GMP certification that will expand them into Europe while many others fight over the U.S. space. Some additional helpful info:
   1. Market Cap = $54m
   2. Recently paid down debt at a discount and don't owe anything until 2023 now
   3. Had an expectedly down Q3, but in Q4 they completed their biggest harvest ever and the stock's volume is picking up quick as it leads up to earnings this month.
   4. Price target of $0.70 from Clarus Securities
   5. Last CEO stepped down, facing criticism for the SP being so much lower than fundamental value (something I target in great value buying opportunities)
   6. From a recent SA article (""Buy a Significantly Undervalued Stock Ready to Turn a Profit): ""it is the book value that jumped out at me the most. VIVO Cannabis is a company on the verge of profitability with a book value that is 4x the current stock price. Given these factors, I am very bullish on VIVO Cannabis. I expect the company’s next few quarters to report positive earnings. And, since there is not a lot of liquidity in a company such as VIVO Cannabis’ stock, there is likely to be a sharp increase upwards in the stock’s price. In the beginning of the year, the company’s stock was double what it is today, trading at \~$0.20 per share. However, I believe that eventually, possibly by the end of next year, the company’s stock will trade above its book value. I am targeting $0.60 per share by the end of next year.""
3. **Baozun (BZUN) -** The Shopify of China, at a massive discount. A company trading for less than it was a year ago despite enormous potential.
   1. Market Cap: $3.04b
   2. Short Interest: 19%
   3. ""Baozun has 260 brand partners including **Nike**, **Microsoft**, and Philips, and that figure is up from 223 the year before and 95 in 2015, showing the company is quickly growing its corporate customer base.""
   4. Revenue growth 20%+
   5. An investment into the rapidly growing Chinese e-commerce market. Trading at a solid discount even after today's gains due to uncertainty in the Chinese market. If you're wondering the true potential of this company, just take a look at Spotify's charts from the past few years.

&#x200B;

And that's it for now - 3 high growth overly-shorted stocks that I would confidently invest in for 2021, who's breakouts are imminent with massive potential looming. Of course, as always, **do your own due diligence**. I've been fortunate to have had great investing success in the recent years, but I've also missed the mark at times so please research, follow the stocks, buy dips as opposed to runs, and most importantly don't ever invest anything you can't afford to use.

Unless we have the same access to data, and transparency from the industry, the game is stacked against retailer investors. We don't truly know if short hedges were close to illiquidity or they were just losing manageable sizes. Hell, we don't even know who the players are. 

Sure, there is foul play. But maybe all they needed to do is to kill the buy side momentum for a few days and watch us shatter like we always do. 

I watched the posts deteriorate in quality until it is left with just a bunch of rally cries and we're not leavings. Nobody is doing any meaningful analysis anymore, its all blind faith. Furthermore, more and more sentiments of media narratives, conspiracies, are creeping up uncomfortably. I thought QAnon was stupid, but I can kinda understand how people fall into it now.

I am going to dumb this down for you.

Voice assistants are an extension of search.

People use voice assistants to search for things.

It was dumb of Microsoft to use a hard to say word like Cortana for their voice assistant instead of using their existing search brand, Bing.   Hi bing what's the weather like, hi Bing can you tell me how tall the Eiffel tower is...  Sure there are automation tasks for voice assistants but that is an added benefit (for now).  I see automation tasks being the most important part later on.

Also, I get that Cortana was the name for an AI in halo but no one outside of halo fan base cares.

They could have changed the perception of Bing with an addition of voice search assistant.  People would have been saying hi bing, instead of hi alexa and hi google.

google figured out people use search assistants to search for things and just named their thing google.  Sadly Microsoft still hasn't figured this out.   I presume it is because people that work there that can't understands this simple concept.  seems like alot of reddit doesn't either.

- Timothy E. Bixby (CFO) sold 18% of his shares (50,000 sold)

Reading the figures in their annual statement with those ""adjusted"" measures and then going over the actual balance sheet is like stepping into an alternate dimension.

To give a positive about the company, they have no debt so it will be a challenge for them to go bankrupt. But perhaps they are inventive enough to accomplish that somehow.

My Positions--

I'm short enough LMND shares to use 10% of my account's equity balance. (I have another 10% equity tied up to short DASH, so 20% of equity balance used total). My short proceeds are invested long in mostly blue-chips, so I'm 120/20 long/short. To be margin called, would have to see the short positions grow rapidly while my other equities got killed - pretty unlikely.

If some news comes out which changes the story to where I think they'll ever make serious profits, I'll cover... But I think LMND is future penny-stock material a few years down the road. I haven't decided exactly where to close the position out yet. Basically my intent is to short them all the way down, as long as it won't exceed 10% of account equity.

I considered buying a protective call to hedge upside on the short position, but after looking at the numbers that eats too much of the potential profit. So I'm monitoring closely.

Wat?  It was a great strategy.  GME rose over 4000% on this squeeze.  

People coming in at the end were just late to the party.  They bet on an infinite squeeze (which could have happened if more float had been locked up) and it didn't happen.  The fact that this wasn't an inifinite squeeze doesn't take away from the fact that the squeeze itself was an overwhelming success for anyone who got in on the ground floor.

At any rate, it's unlikely a short squeeze opportunity like GME will come again (or at least not for many years).  Melvin lost billions on this.

A little homework on the tech.

“The challenge is not simply lithium extraction. It’s a complex tangle of chemical, engineering, economics, and supply chain issues,” said Peter Fiske, director of Berkeley Lab’s [Water-Energy Resilience Research Institute](https://www.werri.lbl.gov/).

It's worth looking into the Salton Sea. Just google ""Lithium Valley."" The hopeful future of the area is geothermal and lithium. Berkshire Hathaway Energy teamed up with Lilac Solutions and Controlled Thermal Resources to help develop the tech. Berkshire already runs about 10 geothermal fields in the area. This technology will make those more profitable. The Rhine valley and Salton Sea are the geologically significant areas identified so far. So VUL seems to be working on the EU version.

600,GME," I’m currently planning for my bounce back...

Not going to lie guys, I’m absolutely disgusted with myself. I’ve been investing since I was 18. I’m 21 now, and 3 years is by no means enough time to consider myself to be as educated as many other members in this forum, but I did something I never thought I would do: I bit on the thing I would’ve laughed at people for buying a few months ago.

I started working in high school as soon as I could. Always put away half of my check on paydays, saved 75-80% of all birthday/holiday season gifts (in cash, my dad had me start doing this when I was pretty young), and worked on the side for random cash jobs when I could.

I’m a university student now, and I did lose my job at the start of the covid-19 pandemic, but I’d be lying if I said I entered 2021 on a bad note. I felt like a financially comfortable college student, and that was a luxury my friends didn’t have.

I’m sure many of you have guessed what happened to me by the tone of this post, but I bit on GME. I went against every logical instinct in my body, sold off numerous shares in companies continuing to grow through all of this, and have watched money I spent hours/days/weeks/months/years building. I’ve taken bad beats before, but never like this.

A lot of the older members of this sub have probably already been down this road, but for the younger guys out there.... please learn from me.

I know that Mark Cuban and Elon talked about it.

I know that low volumes are being sold off.

But I knew the stock was never going to bounce back. I knew the initial train was the only one departing, but I didn’t want to believe it. I missed out on every major Bitcoin dip because I was worried about this happening. I missed Tesla because I figured the consistent growth from my investments would outshine the hit-or-miss chance of Tesla taking off. I’ve missed plenty of others, but I was very comfortable for a kid my age up until yesterday. I lost thousands.

If you’re going to get lucky on a stock, make it just that... luck. Don’t become emotionally invested. Hell, becoming logically invested can be dangerous at times. The bottom line is that the market is the market. Things go up, things go down... if you’re knowledgeable, you’ll hopefully stay up more often than not. A sure-fire way to make sure you can’t consistently build your investment portfolio is to invest in stuff receiving a majority of its hype from guys that decided to major in economics because they saw “The Wolf of Wall Street”.

I have a few grand left in my investing account that I’ll use to trade with once I map out a plan. I have cash on hand, a good bit of money in Bitcoin, and a few investments in companies that still look good. Either way, this sucks and I’m extremely embarrassed. I’d be lying if I said this didn’t hurt my pride... I felt like I was really getting the hang of this stuff and I wasn’t. Now I’m going to start from virtually the beginning.

I probably lucked out by having this happen to me young. I didn’t lose a lot of money depending on your perspective, I just lost a large % of my money. As a student, this sucks, but I’m seeing people taking losses that could easily be life changing (in a bad way).

New people, young people whoever needs to see this... don’t be me.",saurn110,5,/r/investing/comments/lbkcln/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/glw4dgq/,0.124,0.747,0.129,0.4096

604,AAPL," 28 years old. \~30k/year income. 

Trying to build capital as quick as possible without ""gambling"". I learned that lesson with GME and AMC the hard way.

I recently opened up a Roth IRA but haven't been able to do anything with it yet. I'm planning on taking $500 cash and my tax return (\~500) and putting it into my Roth. I'm sold on ETFs and safer long term stocks. After that initial investment I plan to put an additional $50-100 every two weeks indefinitely. That makes it far below the max of 6k per year but it's all I can do at the moment.

My question is, since I'm younger and I plan to hold for the long term I am a little more risk tolerant with the hope of getting started quicker. Would you suggest splitting that between companies like Disney and AAPL or stick straight to the ETFs/index funds? My reasoning for leaning towards those companies are that Disney seems like a really good recovery stock in the next few years and AAPL is about as safe as a stock gets (from what I've read) and always has the potential of splitting down the road. These companies, while having more risk involved, also have much higher growth percentages than ETFs.

624,ACHV," Hi all

I'm in my mid-twenties and married in the US. My husband and I have been wanting to getting more into doing some personal investing (we have other investments handled through a broker TRowe). We took some savings $$ and gambled.

i've been reading up a lot on the companies and situations, but def bought into the GME mania.

We  have the following:

\- 7 shares @ $250 GME

\- 26 shares @$19 in BB

\- 15 shares @$12 in ACHV

\- 4 shares @ $15 in APHA

\- 5 shares @ $25 in in TLRY

\- 6 shares @ $9 in AMC

How are we looking?  Really just want a logical and realistic gut check. I know we bought in due to the hysteria for GME, but i feel like at least the others have potential from what i've read. Depending what happens with GME, we hopefully won't lose too much and be able to put that into other stocks...

&#x200B;

\*to clarify if we lose everything on GME we are ok with it - just not ideal... we do not need this money immediately - we figured we would sit for awhile. We just want to grow our money intelligently. We are both employed.

I've found tons of good resources on how to research and all of that, but what I'm struggling with is how to figure out what strategy I want to focus on, or even where to start experimenting to figure that out. All I know for sure is that I want the timing of my investments to be longer than day-trading (pretty sure this will be a side thing for me, don't want to be focusing on this all the time) but not quite as long as a decades-long approach (I've got a 401k I'm happy with so I'm satisfied with my set-and-forget type situation).

639,GME," This week, I lost $800 in the GME madness. I thought I could get in & out fast enough to make a few hundred dollars. Suffice to say I waited too long.


&nbsp; 

In 2017, I dropped $4,500 on crypto-- some moves have proven dumb (ICX, REQ), some not so dumb (ETH, VET). Overall, however, I was in the red as of last week. In the midst of GME despair, predicting that GME's collapse would tug down the crypto market, I sold all my crypto ""HODLings"" for $2,750. The very next day, most of those coins started skyrocketing, and all I can do is look on in despair.

 
&nbsp;

Total ""investing"" balance, between GME and crypto: -$2,550.

 
&nbsp;

Suffice to say I've learned some lessons: 1) I'm not as smart as I thought I was; 2) from now on, when I've got cash to invest, I'm sticking to ETFs, index funds, my IRA, and my 403(b).

 
 &nbsp;

Truth be told (and thank god), I can afford the loss-- while $2,550 is a lot of money, losing it won't have a significant impact on my day-to-day-life. Still, it feels so terrible. I feel like a clown.

 &nbsp;

My question is: How do you get over ""loss despair""? What have you done in the past to stop obsessing over market mistakes?

645,AMD," Wrote up a post today, but auto moderators seem to not want to allow it to post. So I guess I'll throw it in here and will hopefully be useful for whoever stumbles across it:

\--

Let me start by saying I LOVE what Reddit accomplished by attacking greedy shorts and redistributing some wealth. Was happy to participate and it was beautiful to see.

With that said, there's so many new investors coming in without understanding the situation, and who are getting burned and turned off of investing quickly. The reality is GME was heavily shorted for a reason - it's a dying business as games go digital, and it will continue to lose money until they are potentially insolvent. Regardless, catching the shorts with two hands in the cookie jar was brilliant. And there might be another squeeze ahead for all we know. But at some point, GME will return to fair value which at most is around $15/s to $20/s, so SOMEONE has to be left holding the bags when those pop.

In other words, you've got a chance at some growth, but the downside is still about 80% from here, maybe more. So if you've got extra money to throw around, by all means keep at it. But if you don't have the luxury of playing with money you don't need, and wouldn't be ok with 80% downside, the question becomes ""now what?""

Well we have a super inflated market, so patience and cash are incredibly valuable commodities for when an inevitable correction arrives. But that doesn't mean there isn't great value out there. And it also doesn't mean there aren't stocks that have the upside of GME while also having the fundamental value to limit their downside. Here I'll list a few of my favorite beaten down stocks with massive potential growth. My previous picks for high growth in my portfolio were SunPower (+800%), Magnite (+694%), Enphase (+4,200%), Redfin (my biggest holding, up 600%), Fiverr (+946%), AMD (+629%) and Invitae (+524%). Another was Carvana, but I sold at about $18 once I doubled so I don't even want to look where it is now...

So what's next on the list? I'd love to hear what other people are thinking, but here's the high growth I'm buying into right now:

&#x200B;

1. **Glu Mobile (GLUU)** \- Mobile Gaming Company. Great value, good balance sheet, overshorted, rapidly growing industry, cheaply valued compared to peers, popular line of recurring revenue games plus new developments sparking growth (including Disney Partnership). Top line info:
   1. Market Cap = $1.56b
   2. Short Interest: 12.85%
   3. Healthy Balance Sheet: Net Cash Position of $365m
   4. Trading at 3x forward sales, compared to peers like Skillz trading at 30x forward sales
2. **Vivo Cannabis (VVCIF) -** We all know cannabis has been moving up in the U.S. after the election, but there's still some tantalizing value north of the border in a beaten down stock that is is closing in on turning on a profit, and has a fantastic product line that continues to sell of the shelves. They've been dominating the Ontario concentrate market and have a foothold in multiple avenues that would spark enormous growth including a beverage development deal and a pending EU-GMP certification that will expand them into Europe while many others fight over the U.S. space. Some additional helpful info:
   1. Market Cap = $54m
   2. Recently paid down debt at a discount and don't owe anything until 2023 now
   3. Had an expectedly down Q3, but in Q4 they completed their biggest harvest ever and the stock's volume is picking up quick as it leads up to earnings this month.
   4. Price target of $0.70 from Clarus Securities
   5. Last CEO stepped down, facing criticism for the SP being so much lower than fundamental value (something I target in great value buying opportunities)
   6. From a recent SA article (""Buy a Significantly Undervalued Stock Ready to Turn a Profit): ""it is the book value that jumped out at me the most. VIVO Cannabis is a company on the verge of profitability with a book value that is 4x the current stock price. Given these factors, I am very bullish on VIVO Cannabis. I expect the company’s next few quarters to report positive earnings. And, since there is not a lot of liquidity in a company such as VIVO Cannabis’ stock, there is likely to be a sharp increase upwards in the stock’s price. In the beginning of the year, the company’s stock was double what it is today, trading at \~$0.20 per share. However, I believe that eventually, possibly by the end of next year, the company’s stock will trade above its book value. I am targeting $0.60 per share by the end of next year.""
3. **Baozun (BZUN) -** The Shopify of China, at a massive discount. A company trading for less than it was a year ago despite enormous potential.
   1. Market Cap: $3.04b
   2. Short Interest: 19%
   3. ""Baozun has 260 brand partners including **Nike**, **Microsoft**, and Philips, and that figure is up from 223 the year before and 95 in 2015, showing the company is quickly growing its corporate customer base.""
   4. Revenue growth 20%+
   5. An investment into the rapidly growing Chinese e-commerce market. Trading at a solid discount even after today's gains due to uncertainty in the Chinese market. If you're wondering the true potential of this company, just take a look at Spotify's charts from the past few years.

&#x200B;

And that's it for now - 3 high growth overly-shorted stocks that I would confidently invest in for 2021, who's breakouts are imminent with massive potential looming. Of course, as always, **do your own due diligence**. I've been fortunate to have had great investing success in the recent years, but I've also missed the mark at times so please research, follow the stocks, buy dips as opposed to runs, and most importantly don't ever invest anything you can't afford to use.

Hope you enjoyed the post, would love to hear other similar ideas as the GME hype fizzles, and best of luck to you all!",WaveyGraveyDavey,2,/r/investing/comments/lbkcln/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/glwrj5z/,0.057,0.729,0.214,0.9996

But at some point, GME will return to fair value which at most is around $15/s to $20/s, so SOMEONE has to be left holding the bags when those pop.

In other words, you've got a chance at some growth, but the downside is still about 80% from here, maybe more. So if you've got extra money to throw around, by all means keep at it. But if you don't have the luxury of playing with money you don't need, and wouldn't be ok with 80% downside, the question becomes ""now what?""

Well we have a super inflated market, so patience and cash are incredibly valuable commodities for when an inevitable correction arrives. But that doesn't mean there isn't great value out there. And it also doesn't mean there aren't stocks that have the upside of GME while also having the fundamental value to limit their downside. Here I'll list a few of my favorite beaten down stocks with massive potential growth. My previous picks for high growth in my portfolio were SunPower (+800%), Magnite (+694%), Enphase (+4,200%), Redfin (my biggest holding, up 600%), Fiverr (+946%), AMD (+629%) and Invitae (+524%). Another was Carvana, but I sold at about $18 once I doubled so I don't even want to look where it is now...

So what's next on the list? I'd love to hear what other people are thinking, but here's the high growth I'm buying into right now:

&#x200B;

1. **Glu Mobile (GLUU)** \- Mobile Gaming Company. Great value, good balance sheet, overshorted, rapidly growing industry, cheaply valued compared to peers, popular line of recurring revenue games plus new developments sparking growth (including Disney Partnership). Top line info:
   1. Market Cap = $1.56b
   2. Short Interest: 12.85%
   3. Healthy Balance Sheet: Net Cash Position of $365m
   4. Trading at 3x forward sales, compared to peers like Skillz trading at 30x forward sales
2. **Vivo Cannabis (VVCIF) -** We all know cannabis has been moving up in the U.S. after the election, but there's still some tantalizing value north of the border in a beaten down stock that is is closing in on turning on a profit, and has a fantastic product line that continues to sell of the shelves. They've been dominating the Ontario concentrate market and have a foothold in multiple avenues that would spark enormous growth including a beverage development deal and a pending EU-GMP certification that will expand them into Europe while many others fight over the U.S. space. Some additional helpful info:
   1. Market Cap = $54m
   2. Recently paid down debt at a discount and don't owe anything until 2023 now
   3. Had an expectedly down Q3, but in Q4 they completed their biggest harvest ever and the stock's volume is picking up quick as it leads up to earnings this month.
   4. Price target of $0.70 from Clarus Securities
   5. Last CEO stepped down, facing criticism for the SP being so much lower than fundamental value (something I target in great value buying opportunities)
   6. From a recent SA article (""Buy a Significantly Undervalued Stock Ready to Turn a Profit): ""it is the book value that jumped out at me the most. VIVO Cannabis is a company on the verge of profitability with a book value that is 4x the current stock price. Given these factors, I am very bullish on VIVO Cannabis. I expect the company’s next few quarters to report positive earnings. And, since there is not a lot of liquidity in a company such as VIVO Cannabis’ stock, there is likely to be a sharp increase upwards in the stock’s price. In the beginning of the year, the company’s stock was double what it is today, trading at \~$0.20 per share. However, I believe that eventually, possibly by the end of next year, the company’s stock will trade above its book value. I am targeting $0.60 per share by the end of next year.""
3. **Baozun (BZUN) -** The Shopify of China, at a massive discount. A company trading for less than it was a year ago despite enormous potential.
   1. Market Cap: $3.04b
   2. Short Interest: 19%
   3. ""Baozun has 260 brand partners including **Nike**, **Microsoft**, and Philips, and that figure is up from 223 the year before and 95 in 2015, showing the company is quickly growing its corporate customer base.""
   4. Revenue growth 20%+
   5. An investment into the rapidly growing Chinese e-commerce market. Trading at a solid discount even after today's gains due to uncertainty in the Chinese market. If you're wondering the true potential of this company, just take a look at Spotify's charts from the past few years.

&#x200B;

And that's it for now - 3 high growth overly-shorted stocks that I would confidently invest in for 2021, who's breakouts are imminent with massive potential looming. Of course, as always, **do your own due diligence**. I've been fortunate to have had great investing success in the recent years, but I've also missed the mark at times so please research, follow the stocks, buy dips as opposed to runs, and most importantly don't ever invest anything you can't afford to use.

But at some point, GME will return to fair value which at most is around $15/s to $20/s, so SOMEONE has to be left holding the bags when those pop.

In other words, you've got a chance at some growth, but the downside is still about 80% from here, maybe more. So if you've got extra money to throw around, by all means keep at it. But if you don't have the luxury of playing with money you don't need, and wouldn't be ok with 80% downside, the question becomes ""now what?""

Well we have a super inflated market, so patience and cash are incredibly valuable commodities for when an inevitable correction arrives. But that doesn't mean there isn't great value out there. And it also doesn't mean there aren't stocks that have the upside of GME while also having the fundamental value to limit their downside. Here I'll list a few of my favorite beaten down stocks with massive potential growth. My previous picks for high growth in my portfolio were SunPower (+800%), Magnite (+694%), Enphase (+4,200%), Redfin (my biggest holding, up 600%), Fiverr (+946%), AMD (+629%) and Invitae (+524%). Another was Carvana, but I sold at about $18 once I doubled so I don't even want to look where it is now...

So what's next on the list? I'd love to hear what other people are thinking, but here's the high growth I'm buying into right now:

&#x200B;

1. **Glu Mobile (GLUU)** \- Mobile Gaming Company. Great value, good balance sheet, overshorted, rapidly growing industry, cheaply valued compared to peers, popular line of recurring revenue games plus new developments sparking growth (including Disney Partnership). Top line info:
   1. Market Cap = $1.56b
   2. Short Interest: 12.85%
   3. Healthy Balance Sheet: Net Cash Position of $365m
   4. Trading at 3x forward sales, compared to peers like Skillz trading at 30x forward sales
2. **Vivo Cannabis (VVCIF) -** We all know cannabis has been moving up in the U.S. after the election, but there's still some tantalizing value north of the border in a beaten down stock that is is closing in on turning on a profit, and has a fantastic product line that continues to sell of the shelves. They've been dominating the Ontario concentrate market and have a foothold in multiple avenues that would spark enormous growth including a beverage development deal and a pending EU-GMP certification that will expand them into Europe while many others fight over the U.S. space. Some additional helpful info:
   1. Market Cap = $54m
   2. Recently paid down debt at a discount and don't owe anything until 2023 now
   3. Had an expectedly down Q3, but in Q4 they completed their biggest harvest ever and the stock's volume is picking up quick as it leads up to earnings this month.
   4. Price target of $0.70 from Clarus Securities
   5. Last CEO stepped down, facing criticism for the SP being so much lower than fundamental value (something I target in great value buying opportunities)
   6. From a recent SA article (""Buy a Significantly Undervalued Stock Ready to Turn a Profit): ""it is the book value that jumped out at me the most. VIVO Cannabis is a company on the verge of profitability with a book value that is 4x the current stock price. Given these factors, I am very bullish on VIVO Cannabis. I expect the company’s next few quarters to report positive earnings. And, since there is not a lot of liquidity in a company such as VIVO Cannabis’ stock, there is likely to be a sharp increase upwards in the stock’s price. In the beginning of the year, the company’s stock was double what it is today, trading at \~$0.20 per share. However, I believe that eventually, possibly by the end of next year, the company’s stock will trade above its book value. I am targeting $0.60 per share by the end of next year.""
3. **Baozun (BZUN) -** The Shopify of China, at a massive discount. A company trading for less than it was a year ago despite enormous potential.
   1. Market Cap: $3.04b
   2. Short Interest: 19%
   3. ""Baozun has 260 brand partners including **Nike**, **Microsoft**, and Philips, and that figure is up from 223 the year before and 95 in 2015, showing the company is quickly growing its corporate customer base.""
   4. Revenue growth 20%+
   5. An investment into the rapidly growing Chinese e-commerce market. Trading at a solid discount even after today's gains due to uncertainty in the Chinese market. If you're wondering the true potential of this company, just take a look at Spotify's charts from the past few years.

&#x200B;

And that's it for now - 3 high growth overly-shorted stocks that I would confidently invest in for 2021, who's breakouts are imminent with massive potential looming. Of course, as always, **do your own due diligence**. I've been fortunate to have had great investing success in the recent years, but I've also missed the mark at times so please research, follow the stocks, buy dips as opposed to runs, and most importantly don't ever invest anything you can't afford to use.

1. Rolls-Royce.   Seems really low and... From my research  looks like it's a company   invested in UK defence/military system. Beside, it's a major jet-engine   producer (4th in the martket from what I found out). Will wait for   another dip \~0.7 and I think I might try to buy in. Worst case   scenario... I don't think this is the kind of company, that will be   allowed by UK to evaporate.
2. Wanted   to buy Tilray, but... In recent days it went up a lot, so... For now,   I'll just wait. Maybe some dip will happen, maybe not.
3. Thought   about hyped NOKIA (but long-term). Seems there is some value in it,   but... First of all, their market cap is 20B... I don't really think   they can double that in short time. Second thing - it's a public   company, and the biggest competitor of this sector is private, which...   Doesn't predict a huge success in my opinion.
4. AMC   - I actually think, that long-term, it's not bad. They have a  difficult  time right now, but I think they might be much better, when  pandemic  will end (if it will... Don't know).

656,GME," Hi,

another stupid guy who into GME too late and stayed there for too long.

First I  around 7,34 shares at $307 (Trading212). It was mostly for educational reasons and it was something that I was willing to lose (some of it)

After I witnessed how the good people holding the line after the Robinhood restriction and surviving the drop I decided to get in more (stupid idea).

Got 5 more at $229 (eToro) from another broker.

Last I got 5 more at $319 (+ $20  for fees) from another broker where I can use premarket.

I really wanted to exit Monday morning premarket (with okayish profit for couple of days) and when the market opened but I ignored my reasoning and kept my position.

&#x200B;

So my total is 17@295

First time this week is GME sot super down (so far) during premarket. Every other day it was. 

I want to ask you for an advice, what is the play now. Sell it when the market and just swallow the huge loss? Or wait for a bit during the day and sell it a little bit higher?",b0mbic,2,/r/investing/comments/lbkcln/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gluqk1t/,0.067,0.828,0.104,0.8053

661,GME," For anyone asking about GME, I wanted to provide my thoughts.  I'm not a professional so you can take it with a grain of salt.

Last week CNBC reported that Citron and Melvin Capital had closed their short positions.  I don't want to get into a political fake news discussion, but I have not seen the same kind of gamma squeeze action since then.  Some analysts have indicated that the orders on the books during some of the violent price swings were hundreds of thousands of dollars and even millions of dollars at a time.  Their beliefs were that these may indicate other hedge funds squeezing with retail.  If true they probably got in and got out.

It's entirely possible that these narratives about the big corporation profiteering on struggling business, ""I like the stock"", and that CNBC was outright lying are designed to turn people into bag holders.  If you want out and can convince others to buy, you are better off selling into volume.  What if you're no longer rising up against the evil hedge fund?  It's easy to get caught up in the hype, and it's possible that there's more gains to be had, but you do need to seriously consider the alternative.",ParkerGuitarGuy,2,/r/investing/comments/lbkcln/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/glv3nuk/,0.132,0.78,0.088,-0.8521

I am 19yo from Poland.  


I am about to recieve about 15000USD of inheritance. I am currently in my 1st year of college, living with my parents and my monthly expenses are less than 100USD per month as I live a very frugal lifestyle.  


I would like to mostly protect this money from inflation. It is predicted that the inflation rate in my country will go above 10% in Q3 of the year (Thats 1500 USD down the drain if I just keep it in a bank)  


I have some experience with the stock market, althought mostly I was just doing algorithm based plays on penny stocks (low RSI, under $5 etc)  


I would like to be able to cash out in case of an emergency, but overall I dont mind holding long term.  


My idea is to place around 10 000 USD into 2-5 ETF's and use the remaining 5000 USD for my algorithm plays. (I have around 75-80% accuracy in these plays and I had made a 1000% profit since september 2020 but they are quite risky and you never know when you run out of luck)  


I am wondering if ETF's are the right thing to pick and if so - which ones should I go for? I researched some of them but I have never invested in ETF's and I would like to make an informed decision.

This money isn’t absolutely needed for me to survive, but it’s not money I can afford to lose either. As a student it was absolutely stupid for me me to put almost 1k into this. 

Now my main focus is to just cut my losses. 
I was gonna ask this in WSB, but I’m sick and tired of seeing emojis and to the moon bullshit. 
Genuine question, pls help me out. Should I hold my GME shares in hopes that it will pump (so I can sell then to cut losses) or should I sell now as soon as the market opens?

Any help would be much appreciated guys 🙏🏼",kathmandulegend,1,/r/investing/comments/lbkcln/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/glupzkf/,0.203,0.658,0.139,-0.9125

So I initiated a transfer from RH to Fidelity over the weekend. (*i know, should have done this during store hours and probably with a person on the phone, but I'm a lazy twat that thinks technology is still my friend*)

I get emails from Fidelity, all nice and ""We're starting to save you and your sanity, sit tight, we got you!""

I then see my RH cash management disabled on Monday morning. I can't add/remove cash. OK, things are moving here... so I pop some popcorn and grab the $rope to tie my hands from selling anything (I can't because I'm in the arc of the roller coaster where it is LITERALLY off the rails and I am not longer driving - I'm at the mercy of the systems for now)

Monday ends - no other changes to anything (as far as my control, the price did what it did) and I wake up Tuesday to an auto-email from RH:

""Hey, we got your transfer request, and we love you and don't want you to go! If you didn't request this, please reach out (link to customer service) and let us know. PS - we're going to sell ALL your fractional shares at current market price (or whatever we feel like doing it, so sit tight, the price is still dropping so we're going to see how that goes before we do anything)""

Ummm, WTF?!?! I guess I missed that fractional thing in the paperwork. Yes, I do actually skim terms and such when I check boxes online, but I honestly missed this one. So I say, hold up, let me cancel this transfer and just HOLD inside RH until I decide to either buy up to whole shares or cash it out on my own terms....

I reach out to RH. Only option is to sit on hold (I gave up after 2 hours) or reply to their email/online system. I reply directly from the above email and say ""Wait wait wait, you're right, I love you too. I made a mistake, please don't transfer my account. I am officially saying I didn't mean it! Nothing was supposed to actually transfer until I CONFIRMED the request anyway, you never formally asked me to confirm anything!""

Go to bed Tuesday... I can see my positions from RH showing in Fidelity (not the RIGHT numbers at all. Share counts are wrong, purchase price is wrong, cash is wrong) and my RH account is cancelled in the app so I can't buy, sell, add/remove cash, etc. I am completely locked into this relationship now.

Wake up today and find email from RH - ""Hey we got your customer service request (from like 18 hours ago) and we know we're late to reply, but hey, you didn't pick a good category for your request so we're going to ignore you for now. Feel free to click this link to fix your category (which takes me to opening a NEW request - nope not falling for that) or reply to this email.""

So I am now watching the dip go down and my control is still locked up. I had no problem with being locked out of buying/selling on RH as long as my current positions/cash just MOVED. I understand it would show up just as down and fucked as it was in RH, worse after the last two days - but I was ok with that! It's not a loss until I sell. 

Am i missing something here, was RH really allowed to cancel my account and sell my current positions WITHOUT giving me any opportunity to confirm the transfer? That seems wrong and dumb. ESPECIALLY, if something happened and I wasn't actually the person that REQUESTED the transfer?

692,CC," I'll soon be getting roughly $5,000 to spend from a settlement when I was a minor that was put into a CD by my parents. I'm turning 29 this month, live in an apartment outside New Orleans, and have consistent income, with $6000 in CC debt I accrued while unemployed for 6 months due to covid. Without using the $5k I should have that debt paid off in 6-10 months, assuming no more global pandemics. Even sooner if the job I'm interviewing for pans out. Also assuming I move in with my girlfriend sometime this year, I won't be needing a down payment for a home. If that doesn't happen, I'll be ready for a down payment by mid 2021 by my projections.

Back to this $5k, what would be my best option for investment for growth within a couple of years? I've been playing the stock market in low volumes(put in $300 months ago) through IBKR and have made some money, lost some money, the usual. I didn't hop on GME or any of the other volatile investments currently. What I'd like to do is spend a good portion of that money on a single Amazon stock. The earliest I'll have this money in hand is next week, after the volatility of Amazon from their recent fine and Bezos' resignation blows over.

It seems to be a solid investment to me, and I don't plan on flipping it for profit until I have a reason, like adding to the previously mentioned down payment, emergency expenses, etc. I wouldn't touch it for my usual trading, since I'd rather not piss that money away on what amounts to a gamble. I also acknowledge that *I'm completely fucking ignorant* when it comes to finance and investing as a whole, excepting stock trading where I'm only mostly ignorant. My parents have a lot of investing experience, but they've been pulled out of everything but their IRAs since roughly 2005 and the world has changed a lot since then, so I don't want to go solely off of their input. 

If there are better options, like a mutual fund or short term bonds, or if I'd be better served putting it straight towards that CC debt, I'd be interested in your input.

Yearly high is 152$ and its trading at $109.50 currently. I am hoping we can see a return to those levels but my DD ability is limited if im being honest.

Any advice on how much money (percentage) I should put towards individual stocks? I feel like I don’t want to miss out on greater gains since people seem to make more money investing in individual stocks like tech stocks over the S&P.

I won't be touching this for decades - Current holdings are at the bottom - No debts - I'm in my last year of Undergrad and trying to find jobs that I can do while in DC

I'm going to apologize in advance if this post is long/rambling. I'm just at a point of confusion and I'm not sure where to go with my investing and how to optimize it. I don't have enough money for a financial advisor to even notice me, so I figure that y'all are the best source of advice.

I'm a relatively young investor (19 and have been investing for a few months) that's currently working on building up a dividend portfolio with the goal of being able to have a good steady cashflow. I've been following Joseph Hogue's weekly dividend portfolio with the goal of emulating that for my brokerage account. My Roth follows David Swensen's model that he used to build Yale's endowment. I've been able to put $500/mo into my Brokerage and, once I hit at least 1 of each stock from that portfolio (will be able to by the end of February), I plan to split that more evenly across my Roth and my Brokerage.

I'm planning on shutting down my Robinhood once my cash settles and move the money that I was able to make from GameStop (please don't crucify me lol) into Fidelity.

My main question is how can I optimize my accounts? I like being able to get dividends frequently, but I think getting more dividend income is more important than the frequency. As for my Roth, is there any way that I can improve it? Additionally, what would be the best use of my profits from GameStop investment wise? (About $600). I'd appreciate any and all help/advice :)

I'm going to apologize in advance if this post is long/rambling. I'm just at a point of confusion and I'm not sure where to go with my investing and how to optimize it. I don't have enough money for a financial advisor to even notice me, so I figure that y'all are the best source of advice.

I'm a relatively young investor (19 and have been investing for a few months) that's currently working on building up a dividend portfolio with the goal of being able to have a good steady cashflow. I've been following Joseph Hogue's weekly dividend portfolio with the goal of emulating that for my brokerage account. My Roth follows David Swensen's model that he used to build Yale's endowment. I've been able to put $500/mo into my Brokerage and, once I hit at least 1 of each stock from that portfolio (will be able to by the end of February), I plan to split that more evenly across my Roth and my Brokerage.

I'm planning on shutting down my Robinhood once my cash settles and move the money that I was able to make from GameStop (please don't crucify me lol) into Fidelity.

Information - - 19 years old in the US - Part-Time working with my University, about $900/mo - Brokerage - Build a dividend portfolio to survive (moving to Washington DC in a year for Grad School) Roth - Have a good foundation to grow on - Brokerage - Around a years time with continued growth. Roth - Not for decades - Brokerage - Moderate. I'm not opposed to some risk if it helps with growth. Roth - Moderate-High. I won't be touching this for decades - Current holdings are at the bottom - No debts - I'm in my last year of Undergrad and trying to find jobs that I can do while in DC

I'm going to apologize in advance if this post is long/rambling. I'm just at a point of confusion and I'm not sure where to go with my investing and how to optimize it. I don't have enough money for a financial advisor to even notice me, so I figure that y'all are the best source of advice.

I'm a relatively young investor (19 and have been investing for a few months) that's currently working on building up a dividend portfolio with the goal of being able to have a good steady cashflow. I've been following Joseph Hogue's weekly dividend portfolio with the goal of emulating that for my brokerage account. My Roth follows David Swensen's model that he used to build Yale's endowment. I've been able to put $500/mo into my Brokerage and, once I hit at least 1 of each stock from that portfolio (will be able to by the end of February), I plan to split that more evenly across my Roth and my Brokerage.

I'm planning on shutting down my Robinhood once my cash settles and move the money that I was able to make from GameStop (please don't crucify me lol) into Fidelity.

My main question is how can I optimize my accounts? I like being able to get dividends frequently, but I think getting more dividend income is more important than the frequency. As for my Roth, is there any way that I can improve it? Additionally, what would be the best use of my profits from GameStop investment wise? (About $600). I'd appreciate any and all help/advice :)

I'm planning on shutting down my Robinhood once my cash settles and move the money that I was able to make from GameStop (please don't crucify me lol) into Fidelity.

My main question is how can I optimize my accounts? I like being able to get dividends frequently, but I think getting more dividend income is more important than the frequency. As for my Roth, is there any way that I can improve it? Additionally, what would be the best use of my profits from GameStop investment wise? (About $600). I'd appreciate any and all help/advice :)

Information - - 19 years old in the US - Part-Time working with my University, about $900/mo - Brokerage - Build a dividend portfolio to survive (moving to Washington DC in a year for Grad School) Roth - Have a good foundation to grow on - Brokerage - Around a years time with continued growth.

I won't be touching this for decades - Current holdings are at the bottom - No debts - I'm in my last year of Undergrad and trying to find jobs that I can do while in DC

I'm going to apologize in advance if this post is long/rambling. I'm just at a point of confusion and I'm not sure where to go with my investing and how to optimize it. I don't have enough money for a financial advisor to even notice me, so I figure that y'all are the best source of advice.

I'm a relatively young investor (19 and have been investing for a few months) that's currently working on building up a dividend portfolio with the goal of being able to have a good steady cashflow. I've been following Joseph Hogue's weekly dividend portfolio with the goal of emulating that for my brokerage account. My Roth follows David Swensen's model that he used to build Yale's endowment. I've been able to put $500/mo into my Brokerage and, once I hit at least 1 of each stock from that portfolio (will be able to by the end of February), I plan to split that more evenly across my Roth and my Brokerage.

I'm planning on shutting down my Robinhood once my cash settles and move the money that I was able to make from GameStop (please don't crucify me lol) into Fidelity.

My main question is how can I optimize my accounts? I like being able to get dividends frequently, but I think getting more dividend income is more important than the frequency. As for my Roth, is there any way that I can improve it? Additionally, what would be the best use of my profits from GameStop investment wise? (About $600). I'd appreciate any and all help/advice :)

I'm going to apologize in advance if this post is long/rambling. I'm just at a point of confusion and I'm not sure where to go with my investing and how to optimize it. I don't have enough money for a financial advisor to even notice me, so I figure that y'all are the best source of advice.

I'm a relatively young investor (19 and have been investing for a few months) that's currently working on building up a dividend portfolio with the goal of being able to have a good steady cashflow. I've been following Joseph Hogue's weekly dividend portfolio with the goal of emulating that for my brokerage account. My Roth follows David Swensen's model that he used to build Yale's endowment. I've been able to put $500/mo into my Brokerage and, once I hit at least 1 of each stock from that portfolio (will be able to by the end of February), I plan to split that more evenly across my Roth and my Brokerage.

I'm planning on shutting down my Robinhood once my cash settles and move the money that I was able to make from GameStop (please don't crucify me lol) into Fidelity.

My main question is how can I optimize my accounts? I like being able to get dividends frequently, but I think getting more dividend income is more important than the frequency. As for my Roth, is there any way that I can improve it? Additionally, what would be the best use of my profits from GameStop investment wise? (About $600). I'd appreciate any and all help/advice :)

I'm going to apologize in advance if this post is long/rambling. I'm just at a point of confusion and I'm not sure where to go with my investing and how to optimize it. I don't have enough money for a financial advisor to even notice me, so I figure that y'all are the best source of advice.

I'm a relatively young investor (19 and have been investing for a few months) that's currently working on building up a dividend portfolio with the goal of being able to have a good steady cashflow. I've been following Joseph Hogue's weekly dividend portfolio with the goal of emulating that for my brokerage account. My Roth follows David Swensen's model that he used to build Yale's endowment. I've been able to put $500/mo into my Brokerage and, once I hit at least 1 of each stock from that portfolio (will be able to by the end of February), I plan to split that more evenly across my Roth and my Brokerage.

I'm planning on shutting down my Robinhood once my cash settles and move the money that I was able to make from GameStop (please don't crucify me lol) into Fidelity.

My main question is how can I optimize my accounts? I like being able to get dividends frequently, but I think getting more dividend income is more important than the frequency.

I won't be touching this for decades - Current holdings are at the bottom - No debts - I'm in my last year of Undergrad and trying to find jobs that I can do while in DC

I'm going to apologize in advance if this post is long/rambling. I'm just at a point of confusion and I'm not sure where to go with my investing and how to optimize it. I don't have enough money for a financial advisor to even notice me, so I figure that y'all are the best source of advice.

I'm a relatively young investor (19 and have been investing for a few months) that's currently working on building up a dividend portfolio with the goal of being able to have a good steady cashflow. I've been following Joseph Hogue's weekly dividend portfolio with the goal of emulating that for my brokerage account. My Roth follows David Swensen's model that he used to build Yale's endowment. I've been able to put $500/mo into my Brokerage and, once I hit at least 1 of each stock from that portfolio (will be able to by the end of February), I plan to split that more evenly across my Roth and my Brokerage.

I'm planning on shutting down my Robinhood once my cash settles and move the money that I was able to make from GameStop (please don't crucify me lol) into Fidelity.

My main question is how can I optimize my accounts? I like being able to get dividends frequently, but I think getting more dividend income is more important than the frequency. As for my Roth, is there any way that I can improve it? Additionally, what would be the best use of my profits from GameStop investment wise? (About $600). I'd appreciate any and all help/advice :)

Retail traders usually get fucked thats why they're trying everything in their crooked book of tricks to cover themselves from losing to us... the poor people who aren't supposed to get rich from stocks, were just in it to play with paper and they think its their game.. well not anymore.... so make sure you take all of their money at the top..

HI Guys, I have been able to save up about 10-15k over the past year and now that I have a savings for the first time in my life I'm looking for advice on what moves to make to start off on the right foot

answers to the listed questions:

* **How old are you? What country do you live in?** 
   * I'm 29 living in the Bay Area in the US
* **Are you employed/making income? How much?** 
   * I'm newly employed full time with a big tech company and am making a little over 70k as my starting salary. Hoping to transition to Engineering in the near future which would be a huge pay bump but don't want to count on that
* **What are your objectives with this money? (Buy a house? Retirement savings?)** 
   * I have no specific objective but I guess the answer would be everything. For retirement, I have a 401k through work that I plan to max out and intent to set up a ROTH IRA with betterment that I plan to max out as well but am still open to other retirement advice. Outside of retirement, I just want to set up a solid foundation for whatever comes next (house, car, idk) and obviously whatever would lead to growth 
* **What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs?**
   * Short term growth would be nice as I would love a sense of financial stability but no big purchases on the horizon.  
* **What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know its 100% safe?)**
   * Technically high tolerance, I have close to no expenses outside of groceries/gas type expenses for myself+GF and would be able to recover fairly easily but I'm also not looking to be stupid with my money
* **What are you current holdings? (Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors? Any other assets?)**
   * I have \~1,700 in RH after pulling a small profit from GME and only have \~100 of that spread across a few random stocks. I have my eyes on some clean power and tech ETFs but have not pulled the trigger. No other real assets I can think of.
* **Any big debts (include interest rate) or expenses?**
   * No debts, only hard expenses ATM are car insurance and smaller bills like streaming services. Most money  per week seems to go towards groceries/food.
* **And any other relevant financial information will be useful to give you a proper answer.**

771,GME," Hey everyone, I'm new to this whole investing thing (not trading nor gambling, I know there's a difference), I've considered it some times in the past and, admittedly, I've eventually came around it thanks to the whole GME casino, and besides how it will eventually end there is something I've been reading around that's bugging me:

some people are saying ""this is a perfect time to buy and avg cost down"", but I don't quite get the advantage: it would cost a lot to bring avg spent down to current market price (depending on how much you already have invested ofc, but even if you have 50 @ 150 you'd need like 500 @ 100 to bring the total avg down to 104, and then hope it would fluctuate at least back up 4% to cover those very 50k you just had to put in, all of this to basically get back 2.5k you could have just had taken as a loss instead if you sold @ 100 (the price to invest those 50k to avg down).

In other words, whatever you'd invest into averaging down you would just get back, and to make up for it you have to hope that the stock goes up at least a little bit, other wise you're stuck with a huge investment at even/slight loss, with *still* the original invest in the red.

What is the standard daily/weekly growth rate, in your opinion, of a low to moderate risk portfolio?

My current growth rate, in relatively sensible stocks, (only two seem near term risky due to volatility surrounding them), is ~3%/day.

I don't know about ISAs, but that's a relatively balanced group of funds providing everything from very aggressive growth to more conservative (and even absolute return with Ruffer where the goal is to have some positive return - might be very little - in any given 12 mo period.)

I am not saying it's a sure thing :) But also, I am not saying that it doesn't look kind of interesting. It's more of a ""risky stuff"".

Lot of people getting press because they involved themselves. Chamath too - and with Chamath actually put money into it and he exited and did well. I'm sure he's happy and not fretting over the fact that he didn't ""hold the line!"" Chamath also kinda used it to pump Sofi as a RH alternative.

Cuban didn't buy. The Winkelvoss brother who was pumping this as ""the people vs hedge funds!"" wasn't buying. If it was so compelling, why didn't they? Portnoy lost $700K in meme stocks (Portnoy: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EtURZQ4XEAU-7yx?format=jpg&name=large)

 Meanwhile, a lot of people in this are going to encourage each other to ""hold!"" all the way until the squeeze is over. It's dismaying to me that more people didn't sell when this was well into the $300-400 range because of this ""us vs hedge funds!"" and ""hold!"" mentality.

Lumber prices are hilariously high, they will fall. This is a hangover of the clusterfuck that hit transportation during the worst of the virus.

The risk you have with holding this company is political risk from both US-Canada softwood lumber disputes and also NA-China disputes. WF sells a lot of stuff to China which exposes their order book to political risk there as well. 

WF has some headwinds ahead in particular - the PNW timber harvest is falling off due to a number of factors. Even if a sawmill is ~cheap to set up (150-500 MM) that's still a lot of work to replace capacity that is shutting down due to fiber issues, and the lead time on new mill projects is over 2 yrs right now.

Over 80 % of West Fraser sales are in the US.  I haven't got the figures in front of me, but 60-70+ of the production/manufacturing is in the US.  No tarifs and no issues with China.

Lumber tarrifs have been reduced from about 22% to 8% on average and I believe West Fraser may get more favourable treatment than that.

Annual immigration in Canada has been rest upwards from 225,000 to 400,000 beginning this year and is set to continue at this level for 10 yrs.  More people mean more housing in Canada.  Canadian market demand is taking all that is being produced.

Lumber prices are near or at all time highs depending of the product.  With demand in Canada so high, less product is being shipped to US constraining US supply and keeping demand high.  

You can build more mills but there isn't more supply of timber.  For 10 years Interfor, Canfor, and West Fraser have been buying up distressed mill assets in the US and modernizing them while some former US lumber giants were shedding mills and trying to diversify.  

The biggest trend that affects lumber demand is housing.  They don't get much credit because they have been invisible in the market place until now, but millennials are buying houses and will be for the next 5-10 years.  Interest rates are low and will below for at least 5 years to drive growth to pay off dept.  

Millennials are now the largest sector population wise in both the US and Canada - search out a population pyramid - and visually you will see that there are more millennials than boomers.

They have been making money investing in TSLA, APPL for years - they are the drivers of the economy now.

Now with regard to China, demand has driven up log prices.  Demand is Canada and the US is high.  Deliveries to China are constrained, but prices are higher.

This the situation today.  Covid, and remodel have just accelerated a growing trend.  Lumber, new home starts were increasing before covid hit.

There are a few other factors that make West Fraser, Interfor and Canfor look attractive, but I need another coffee, right now.

BUT, Crypto ""investments"" are NOT considered ""securities"". Crypto is classified as ""commodities"" instead by the SEC and hence are NOT insured for any amount by the SIPC.

So, yes, your fears of loosing your crypto amount is valid, especially so since it cannot be transferred over to another brokerage via the ACATS transfer system.

That said, RHF, has been able to raise $3.4B, just uptill yesterday, in just the past week, and that too in the backdrop of a heavily publicized credit crunch that befell them. Their entire capital raise over the past 7 years they've existed has been $1.97B.

921,IMO," The SIPC (Securities Investor Protection Corporation), a body mandated by US Congress to provide insurance for securities investments, if and when a brokerage goes bankrupt, insures **securities** upto $500,000, which includes upto $250,000 of cash that was present in the brokerage account specifically meant to purchase securities.

BUT, Crypto ""investments"" are NOT considered ""securities"". Crypto is classified as ""commodities"" instead by the SEC and hence are NOT insured for any amount by the SIPC.

So, yes, your fears of loosing your crypto amount is valid, especially so since it cannot be transferred over to another brokerage via the ACATS transfer system.

That said, RHF, has been able to raise $3.4B, just uptill yesterday, in just the past week, and that too in the backdrop of a heavily publicized credit crunch that befell them. Their entire capital raise over the past 7 years they've existed has been $1.97B.

927,UI," I don't think they'll be going under in 6 months or even a year. Long term, like couple years later, maybe. But short term they should at least still be around. That's unless they screw up something that they say in the hearing.

Their biggest issue by far is their loss of trust, because many people lost actual money from this. One of the main benefits Robinhood once had is that they got a lot of free advertising on social media platforms. But going forward, they won't be getting that, and will likely face headwinds on social media instead.

This gave a lot of other platforms users that they never would have gotten. Which gives them a huge incentive to modernize their UI (or launch another UI) for the younger generations. If any of the major brokerages do this, I find it very hard for Robinhood to regain it's users.

I think the only way Robinhood can regain it's users is if all major brokerages do no improvements to their android/iOS apps over like the next year, and Webull who already has a friendly mobile app screws something up big time (like robinhood just did).

949,GME," > I’ve been investing since March 2020 so I’m new blood and I haven’t see anything like this before

Are you talking GME specifically? This was a historical event. Consider all the research papers written on the Volkswagen/Porsche short squeeze - GME will be like that. An event people will be talking and writing about for decades. The overall market volatility hasn't been anything unusual. 

Like all big financial events, regulators and legislators will take the opportunity to push their policy goals. I would hope that regulators would focus on prevention of systemic risks. Their primary primary concern should be preventing individual institutions from taking on so much risk that their failure could lead to failures or severe losses in their counterparties - brokers, investment banks, pension funds, individual investors. Their primary goal should be to prevent a domino series of failures through the financial system. 

> Think they touch our options or institute a transaction tax?

Since 2009 some legislators have pushed for an increase in financial transaction tax. My understanding based on Wikipedia is that the current transaction tax is a very small flat round trip fee. The recent proposals are to impose a tax that is a percentage of the trade value. Such taxes in other countries caused nearly complete collapse of their investment banking activity. The politicians and supporters that are proposing such a tax in the US either ignore this possibility or see this as a positive outcome.",big_deal,3,/r/investing/comments/lbh3so/discussion_on_the_lasting_impacts_of_market/glv0j3k/,0.109,0.794,0.097,-0.4476

Everyone who has invested has lost money at different times, and sometimes big, and the reasons always come down to:

1. inadequate desire to learn
2. desire to get something for nothing
3. immense greed 
4. lack of understanding of mathematics

What can be done though is to do things like tax high frequency trading and the other shitheads that learned some lessons are shorts who have been taking huge risks that they didn't understand... like in 2008 in 2001 in 1997 in ... in 1938 ... in 1770 ... in ... going back forever.

965,FCF," I've been long on $LUMN since October last year. Had a cost basis of about $9.50 before  I sold  between $14-15 during the short squeeze runup last week, but got back in around $12.

Much of their price decline can be attributed to concerns over their debt. Their dividend was cut when interest rates peaked in early 2019, with the concern being interest rates would continue to grow, presenting a risk to the company, so the money was better spent addressing debt.

I think they're in a position to benefit tremendously from lower interest rates during the pandemic. For the past several months Lumen has been taking high interest callable notes from their acquired companies and either using earnings to call them, or refinancing them at much lower interest rates.

Given their progress in reducing debt and interest expense, I think their dividend is stable and can survive a decline in their copper-based revenues as they modernize the company. FCF and earnings exceeds their dividends, so the company itself continues to become more valuable as they pay a very nice dividend that can be either reinvested or put into other companies.",skilliard7,4,/r/investing/comments/lbtwev/lumn_lumen_technologies_value_buy_long_position/glw91kb/,0.099,0.699,0.202,0.9818

>I've read that the tax benefits of the HSA would be superior due the tax advantages.

It's only better if you use it for medical expenses, in which case you get double tax advantages.  If you end up treating it like a retirement fund and withdraw from it when you're 65, you'll pay income tax on it.  That said, since you live in the great USA, you'll definitely have significant medical expenses in your lifetime so I guess you could say that it's better than your Roth IRA.  

I personally avoid using my HSA when possible (since using it early = killing your double tax advantaged growth).  Save it for big medical expenses/emergencies if possible. In my HSA I like to keep enough cash to cover my out of pocket max for the year, and invest the rest in an index fund.",Celodurismo,3,/r/investing/comments/lb8qmy/how_should_i_roth_ira_and_hsa/glt2q3q/,0.048,0.733,0.219,0.9779
993,ALL," Here are some thoughts from a veteran investor:

* Max  out your 401k contribution as you are lucky to be even getting 4% FREE  money from your employer. GRAB ALL the free money FIRST.
* Do  NOT plough ANY more monies into ANY of those ETFs, be it S&P 500 or entire-world-ETFs, VT or VTI or entire-Univ-ETF as the entire stock market and  bond market, even globally, are over-valued bubbles. So just hold your NEW monies in the default cash fund. CASH is king and capital  preservation is paramount.
* You're  lucky to be in the income bracket to be able to contribute to a Roth  IRA, so try to max out that contribution as well. I think, its $7000 in  FY2021. Hold that also in the default cash/money-mkt fund.
* WRT  HSA, if you can maximize the contributions to it, its good. But I'd  suggest first max out the 401k and Roth contributions because you can  use the distributions from these for ANY purpose vis-a-vis the HSA which  MUST be used for medical expenses only at any time, else penalties.
* Also,  Do NOT withdraw money from your HSA forever even for medical expenses,  or atleast till you exhaust ALL other sources of already-taxed funds  (ie., keep paying from your pocket); And definitely never use that HSA  Debit card. Just keep securely filing away the expense receipts and  allow your investments in the account to grow forever; 10-20-30yrs later  you can take out a distribution as long as you have the receipts to  show IRS if they ever audit you for it. BTW, never give a receipt to  your HSA Provider as they have no business knowing what medical issues  you're having,
* Await  atleast a 15%-20% drop in the markets from their peaks, ie., sit-out  this nonsensical bubble in the markets, and try to time it. If you do  not time the markets, you're just another sucker for the Pros who advertise a constant drum-beat saying ""nobody can/should time the markets"", which  just serves the sole purpose of ensuring a constant supply of new monies into the markets and thence their pockets.
* Post bubble pop, while there is a LOT of REAL panic and consternation in the minds of the people, YOU GET IN as below:
   * Each  of your accounts MUST look identical in terms of percentage allocations  into the various sectors AND in the ETF-types; Dont exert yourself trying out different combos in different accounts and confuse the hell  out of yourself trying to manage the differences.
   * The  ONLY difference between your accounts should be THIS: Do NOT EVER put  any money into dividend-paying-ETFs in tax-deferred accounts (viz.,  401k, HSA, IRA) and select ONLY growth ETFs here; REASON: You do not get  any benefits from the lower dividends taxation and marginal tax rates  apply to the entire distribution. Roth IRA is NOT a tax-deferred account  as its taxed upfront, just like your post-taxed regular brokerage  account. AND in such non-tax-deferred accounts, ALWAYS select  dividend-paying-ETFs ONLY. So segregate the same sector-specific ETFs  into growth and dividend and you'll know what ETFs go into which one of  your accounts.
   * Do NOT EVER choose the composite flavor of an ETF. ie., taking your choice  (though a poor one) of the S&P-500 sector itself, do NOT choose the Vanguard VOO, which is a composite of the growth version, VOOG and the value (or  dividend-paying) version VOOV. Choose the more specific versions of  VOOG and VOOV and you'd immediately known which one goes into which  account as per the above rule. The more specific versions usually have  the same Net-ER (Net Expense Ratio). Different brokerages charge  different Net-ERs and you should choose your ETFs from the Fund-family  with the lowest Net-ER at your brokerage. THIS step should become your  most involved one as you research all the ETFs and tabulate and  segregate them.
   * Then,  move onto the next sector from S&P 500, to say the Russell-2000,  then Russell-3000, 4000, 1000, then the International ETFs and do the  same as above.
   * NEVER  re-invest dividends; Take the distribution and run - always. ""They""  goad you to re-invest only because it then becomes an assured stream of  pre-calculable incoming money for their fund(s).
   * Last  cardinal rule, do NOT try to dabble in individual stocks unless you  have ample time and effort to put into following news stories about it  day-in day-out, year-in year-out.
* THAT'S IT, you're a veteran investor now!",vwx99,0,/r/investing/comments/lb8qmy/how_should_i_roth_ira_and_hsa/gltujz2/,0.039,0.903,0.058,0.903

* Also,  Do NOT withdraw money from your HSA forever even for medical expenses,  or atleast till you exhaust ALL other sources of already-taxed funds  (ie., keep paying from your pocket); And definitely never use that HSA  Debit card. Just keep securely filing away the expense receipts and  allow your investments in the account to grow forever; 10-20-30yrs later  you can take out a distribution as long as you have the receipts to  show IRS if they ever audit you for it. BTW, never give a receipt to  your HSA Provider as they have no business knowing what medical issues  you're having,
* Await  atleast a 15%-20% drop in the markets from their peaks, ie., sit-out  this nonsensical bubble in the markets, and try to time it. If you do  not time the markets, you're just another sucker for the Pros who advertise a constant drum-beat saying ""nobody can/should time the markets"", which  just serves the sole purpose of ensuring a constant supply of new monies into the markets and thence their pockets.
* Post bubble pop, while there is a LOT of REAL panic and consternation in the minds of the people, YOU GET IN as below:
   * Each  of your accounts MUST look identical in terms of percentage allocations  into the various sectors AND in the ETF-types; Dont exert yourself trying out different combos in different accounts and confuse the hell  out of yourself trying to manage the differences.
   * The  ONLY difference between your accounts should be THIS: Do NOT EVER put  any money into dividend-paying-ETFs in tax-deferred accounts (viz.,  401k, HSA, IRA) and select ONLY growth ETFs here; REASON: You do not get  any benefits from the lower dividends taxation and marginal tax rates  apply to the entire distribution. Roth IRA is NOT a tax-deferred account  as its taxed upfront, just like your post-taxed regular brokerage  account. AND in such non-tax-deferred accounts, ALWAYS select  dividend-paying-ETFs ONLY. So segregate the same sector-specific ETFs  into growth and dividend and you'll know what ETFs go into which one of  your accounts.
   * Do NOT EVER choose the composite flavor of an ETF. ie., taking your choice  (though a poor one) of the S&P-500 sector itself, do NOT choose the Vanguard VOO, which is a composite of the growth version, VOOG and the value (or  dividend-paying) version VOOV. Choose the more specific versions of  VOOG and VOOV and you'd immediately known which one goes into which  account as per the above rule. The more specific versions usually have  the same Net-ER (Net Expense Ratio). Different brokerages charge  different Net-ERs and you should choose your ETFs from the Fund-family  with the lowest Net-ER at your brokerage. THIS step should become your  most involved one as you research all the ETFs and tabulate and  segregate them.
   * Then,  move onto the next sector from S&P 500, to say the Russell-2000,  then Russell-3000, 4000, 1000, then the International ETFs and do the  same as above.
   * NEVER  re-invest dividends; Take the distribution and run - always. ""They""  goad you to re-invest only because it then becomes an assured stream of  pre-calculable incoming money for their fund(s).
   * Last  cardinal rule, do NOT try to dabble in individual stocks unless you  have ample time and effort to put into following news stories about it  day-in day-out, year-in year-out.

1001,USA," Thank you! I see what you're saying and it makes a lot of sense to me. This matches what's in my head as far as how I think I'm comfortable investing.... ie specific funds... without actually picking stocks. I never liked the blend. It seemed too watered down to me. 

But I had issues investing like that due to overlap. 

What about the overlap, as some funds have the same companies in them like voog and voov? 

How do I weight this in my portfolio? 

Also moving down the list into small and mid cap and international funds... VTI covers all of USA but I see or can see how VTI has the stocks weighted differently vs specific funds. 

VTI weights them according to what their market cap is across the entire market vs the specific funds weight them on their market cap across the specific market. 

Is that what you're trying to say? 

You're still diversified but your investing based on weight in each specific index while able to focus on both the top companies fall into growth or value stock styles?

1002,IMO," Yep, VTI is very diversified.  Don’t bother with bonds or a “target retirement” fund if you’re still young.

If you want to just have a higher growth potential ETF in the Roth IRA that you just regularly contribute to and forget, I recommend looking into [ARKK or one of the ARK variants](https://ark-funds.com/innovation-etfs) These focus on disruptive innovation, and are pretty well liked among the investing subreddits.

There is a higher expense ratio compared to an index fund but it’s one of the few actively managed funds that are worth it IMO. I own a handful of them, especially heavy ARKG.

Side note: I think you meant VIGRX (Growth) instead of VIG (Dividend)... which is good, I definitely recommend VIGRX and have that in my Roth IRA as well.",alexunderwater,-1,/r/investing/comments/lb8qmy/how_should_i_roth_ira_and_hsa/glsqchx/,0.036,0.745,0.219,0.9653

What you do is open another personal-HSA with Fidelity (yes you can open multiple as long as you can tolerate the providers fleecing fees) as theirs is the BEST I've ever seen and has no fees and is most flexible. In your employer-HSA, you keep funds as cash. Then you do a trustee2trustee transfer of all your funds WITHOUT CLOSING OUT (IMPORTANT: do NOT close-out) your account at your employer-chosen HSA into your own Fidelity HSA.

Well, I started with the example of VOOG and VOOV since you seemed more interested in the S&P 500 AND you mentioned few Vangard's ETFs. If you've checked, Vanguard's VOO is just VOO = VOOG + VOOV.

Vanguard (VG), overall, is a strange place for MFs (and hence ETFs) - a huge conglomerate of eclectic fund families, which are historically, an assemblage of completely separate MF companies under one umbrella, called Vanguard. So the investment philosophies are different and even today, they've maintained those differences.

That means, some sets of funds follow the S&P series of indexes, others follow the Russell's and other follow the CRSP sector-specific and cap-specific indexes. This means the same underlying companies might figure up in multiple indexes and hence in multiple ETFs. But that is not the point you should be paying attention to, IOW, dont worry at the underlying companies level. You should just concentrate on getting a somewhat good idea of the various indexes VG ETFs are based on and decide if that pick of index suits your investment philosophy/idea.

For eg., the indexes go by S&P 500, 400, 600, etc and if that's the indexes-family what makes you comfortable, then make a split list of these ETFs into growth-ETFs (eg., VOOG) and value-ETFs (eg., VOOV) and go with putting the growth ones into tax-deferred Accounts and the value-ETFs (because the value ETFs pay higher dividends) into post-taxed Accounts.

Else, you if you feel more satisfied by the Russell's indexes-family, then even under that VG has the value and growth split of ETFs. For eg., for the Russell 1000 index, VONE = VONV + VONG; For the Russell 2000 index, VTWO = VTWV + VTWG, and so on. Then you'd put all the VONV, VTWV, etc into tax-deferred Accounts and the VONG, VTWG, etc. into post-taxed Accounts.

VG has funds in other index-families as well which go CAP-specific. For Eg., for the CRSP 300 index, which is an index of all US Mega-Cap, VG has MGC=MGV+MGK; Then for the CRSP Large Cap index, VG has VV=VTV+VUG. This could be an alternative choice of index-families;

Note that the VT, Total-US-Fund is again just an aggregate fund of all of the sub-ETFs under one such index-family (I forget exactly which ones). And to cover the non-S&P-500, VG has VXF;

So you get the idea - become comfortable with the indexes-families of the ETFs, choose the collection of indexes-family you like, split list the ETFs so as to maximize dividends-payouts on post-taxed accounts and for growth in tax-deferred accounts. You should stay away from looking at the underlying companies and just choose the indexes-families.

If your brokerage charges higher commissions for VG's ETFs, you should go with other companies' ETFs so as to minimize the commissions+fees because those add up to take a significant bite out of your returns.",vwx99,1,/r/investing/comments/lb8qmy/how_should_i_roth_ira_and_hsa/glua5pr/,0.014,0.879,0.108,0.996

1007,ET," >So if my employers HSA plan does not have any investment options I like I can roll over from that to a different HSA...

&#x200B;

Yes. But when you rollover, the HSA Provider will liquidate the needed amount of your investments into the cash-fund and then transfer the cash over as a rollover. Since you're doing a rollover and not taking out a distribution for yourself, its not taxable event. But, just to be precise, it will be characterized as a distribution initially which you will report to IRS as a rollover and hence not taxable.

>Are there any disadvantages to doing this?

&#x200B;

Your time and effort in doing this is what it mostly takes. Usually, there should not be a fee because you would not be fully closing the employers-HSA and only rolling over an amount.

Infact you do not even need to maintain any HSA with that employers' HSA provider. You can always open your HSA at your desired HSA provider and make the contributions to the annual max yourself, but this will then be with post-taxed funds, which you'd then claim back tax exemption for during tax filing. But, there is a loss, albeit small, you'd encounter here - the 6.25% Social-security-tax of your annual HSA contribution. If you have your employer deduct HSA contribution, this 6.25% of that contribution will become additionally available to you - THIS is the ONLY reason you'd maintain that employer-HSA-Account.

If your employers' payroll dept is flexible, you can ask them to directly contribute into your own HSA provider directly and still get that benefit of 6.25% (its your portion, viz., half of the 12.5% of social-sec tax deduction at source). Most employers HR-dept would receive commissions from HSA providers and so they'd not want to encourage direct-deposits into employees own HSA.

1010,IMO," I bought into Walmart back in August/September time frame (2020). Main intention was a stable stock - I think Walmart is one of the MOST stable IMO.

Anyway - I haven't seen too much upward movement from it - in fact, it did take a bit of a dip the past few days. You bring a good point. I think once COVID is behind us it will likely continue to rise (slowly).

I am not at all disappointed with my purchase I only have 6 shares (right when I made my account). It kind of is like a bank account with better interest and dividends in a way. I slightly consider selling it every once in a while if I have better opportunities come my way - but I still have not sold and will likely continue to hold!

1076,RH," You should start another account transfer with fidelity.  The reason it left stocks is because they weren't finalized at the time the fidelity transfer kicked in.

Same thing happened to me, I started another account tranfer... my RH account has been deactivated since last friday, i've been making trades on Fidelity in the meantime.

1079,GME," If one takes the time to read the annual report and do some basic financial analysis GME is a $10-12 stock. The shorts were correct, just got greedy.
If GME follows through and changes its business plan they have the ability to remain a ongoing business. If not, they are toast.
Looking at GME as an investor, I will past. I only do long position investing as shorting is way above my risk tolerence as writing options. Good luck to those who stay, as tuition at the school of hard knocks is quite steep.

1080,BEPC," Actually I think BEPC is the best positioned green play in the world. The issue is everyone’s gone crazy for small cap shit companies hoping to make 10 baggers and are rolling into a lot of garbage IMO (not saying you can’t make great gains there but it isn’t long term). Bepc has the largest assets of any pure renewable globally and it has excellent backers and management. It’s also up almost 100 percent in a year for a bigish company. Bepc is the business I think will be great still in 10 years whereas a lot of the other plays, likely not as much. But time will tell. I’m a millennial but this whole “boomer” stock as an insult is ridiculous btw. There’s a lot of “boomers” who are way richer than us millennials and also a lot of “boomer stocks” that are excellent long term plays. In addition, when you use insulting language towards a group of people just because they’re older than you, it makes all of us non boomers look like dicks. The “boomers” aren’t on here making fun of millennials or gen z.

1082,BEP," I’ve held BEP for about 2-3 years. It’s the largest single position in my normal brokerage account. My total return has been around 95%. 

So what are you comparing the “boomer stock” to? Meme stocks? SPACs? Experimental EV technology that may never actually materialize? Because by those metrics, maybe it’s a boring boomer stock. 

But for an average return of about 40-45% per year, crushing the S&P 500? Yeah I’ll take that. And I’ll DRIP those dividends for the next 20 years til I retire.

1085,KODK," I've traded KODK puts over a dozen times and never have had a loss.  I'm very careful.  Last time I traded I was selling the 7 short time (three or so days).  I let them expire, sometimes I'm assigned but it always works out.  I wouldn't touch KODK in the 9s.  Let it come back around 7 and work from there.  If you have the cash it would be a good move to tuck 1000 shares away and wait for a pop above 10 (unfortunately I have never done this even though I have the cash, hopefully next time).  It has popped from under 7 to over 10 on at least three occasions since the big run up last year then it settles back down.
