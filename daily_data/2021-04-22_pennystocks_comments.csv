3. Nutra Pharma is already generating revenue with their Nyloxin®, Pet Pain-Away, and Equine Pain-Away in the over-the-counter pain management market, selling on different platforms such as Amazon, Walmart, and etc. They are selling worldwide in India as well. 

4. Already granted Orphan Drug Status on their lead drug RPI-78M for treating Multiple Sclerosis in children. 

5. All drugs completed Phase I trial and are ready for next phases II/III. 

6. They have been working with private laboratories and governmental agencies to move forward their Nerve Agent Countermeasures and technology. Government grants and contracts are coming as stated in the shareholders letter by company. 

7. Research partnership/joint ventures and funding to be announced regarding their lead drug RPI-78M for Multiple Sclerosis, HIV, ALS/AMN

Throughout 2021, we expect to continue actively marketing Nyloxin®, Pet Pain-Away and Equine Pain-Away. We are currently working to begin a broad retail rollout that follows our acceptance at Walmart.com. These sales will bring in the revenue that will bring the company to profitability as well as provide the financing for the proposed clinical studies. 

In 2021, we plan to begin working with joint venture partners to begin clinical trials with our Multiple Sclerosis (MS) drug, RPI-78M under our Orphan designation for pediatric MS. The Orphan status of the drug will allow for faster, less expensive trials as we lay the groundwork for the eventual drug production and trial protocol development. It is our goal to complete the Phase I/II trials in pediatric MS over the next 18-24 months and then either move into Phase III trials or seek a licensing partner. 

We also plan to move forward with our work in nerve agent counter-measures and are filing for several grants with US governmental agencies to fund that work. 

We believe that we have set the path for a bright future starting with 2021. Sales growth and marketing expansion will allow for a better market for our products and services. Marketing partnerships will bring in strategic investors with a vested interest in the future of our Company.

55,DD," Nice summary:

“Custodial plays are when a “shell cleaner upper” of sorts comes in and takes over a defunct publicly trading company. A shell, a public company that has a share structure in place, but no real assets or company inside it. These shells, due to having no business in them, most likely will not trade, will not have filings and will not release news – thus falling dormant....When a custodian comes in and takes control of the shell company, they most likely clean it up with hopes of finding a private company looking to reverse merge into the shell. The excitement, anticipation and speculation of someone putting a new business and assets into the shell draws penny investors into these lottery style plays. OTC investors call these “lottos”, because the risk to reward potential is significant.”

http://psinvestor.com/shell-game-reverse-mergers-and-custodial-plays-making-penny-stock-investors-big-bucks/

At best, they result in a legitimate private company using a reverse merger to take over the cleaned up shell, resulting in $$$$$. At worst it’s a scam where the custodianship company/lawyers are basically just moving around shells to make money and fleece investors. What often happens is neither, and the custodianship cleans up the shell but it never really does much, so the risk/reward is trying to take advantage of the share price bump that usually occurs when the custodianship is approved, as there’s no guarantee for a future bump.

In the case of $SMAA, the rumor that a custodianship is in the works is what may lead to gains. With $FBCD, the custodianship is getting hyped with merger rumors. Fair warning, most of this speculation is trash so do your own DD and only invest what you can afford to lose completely!",Both_Ends_Burning,3,/r/pennystocks/comments/mvz68f/daily_plays_april_22_2021/gvfp0xg/,0.093,0.737,0.17,0.9679

Anyone knows if the new April 22 SEC rule applies to OTC?

So I'm sure I'm not the only one who has been hearing about this supposedly new SEC rule which basically doesn't allow you to short unless you got collateral on hand. I was pretty excited about this for OTC, fintwit is too and so is ihub and ST about this rule cos I know we get laughed at when we say ""mm manipulation"" but doesn't take a genius to see whats going on recently.

Apparently this April 22 sec rule doesn't apply to OTC? Cos OTC shares are not shorted by borrowing but synthetic shares are used to short aka naked shorting

The SEC article doesn't state that their new rule only applies to those who short by borrowing so I'm not too sure? You mean to tell me naked shorting is allowed?",mateyman,8,/r/pennystocks/comments/mvwaq4/the_lounge_thoughts_noob_stuff_low_effort_brokers/gvf466x/,0.019,0.855,0.126,0.9401
