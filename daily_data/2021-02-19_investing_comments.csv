6,JE," Just had a quick look on a market data platform I have access to and apparently Deliveroo now have a higher market share than Just Eat, at 29% vs 25%.  
  
Data is:  
2016 - Just Eat 43%, Deliveroo 4.5%  
2017 - Just Eat 40%, Deliveroo 11%  
2018 - Just Eat 38%, Deliveroo 16%  
2019 - Just Eat 35%, Deliveroo 20%  
2020 - Just Eat 29%, Deliveroo 24%  
  
So despite Just Eat growing at a very respectable level of roughly 25-30% a year in revenue terms, Deliveroo have been growing at something like an average of just under 100% per year. Although JE are apparently profitable, whereas Deliveroo obviously are not.

7,UK," I agree with your pount about the power of negotiation. Its a very important part of all levels of employment.

My counter would be that these negotiations should have a baseline in which the employee is guranteed a base level of care. In the UK for example they have a minimum wage. They also have a pay scheme for the unemployed. These give the most financially vulnerable people in society the ability to negotiate. Without the unemployment benefit and minimum wage employers could drive prices down to almost nothing.

28,ASC," So the most logical explanation I can think of—assuming the financial reporting standards did not change in a given year—would be that there was some sort of retroactive adjustment the company made to correct the cash balance.

People make mistakes so if it was discovered in 2020 that 2019’s cash balance was over/understated then an adjustment would’ve been recorded to fix it.

If that’s the case then the company would’ve probably disclosed the adjustment in their Financial Statement notes; or, if there was a change in accounting policy during 2020 (i.e. new ASC standards), and that affected cash then that should’ve been reported in the notes as well.

29,USA," The easiest question is why do lifestrategy funds include bonds.  The reason for that is federal regulation.  By law a lifestrategy fund offered in a 401k must be 10% bonds and be bond appropriate as people age.  

Now the more general point gets to why.  As you increase the draw from a portfolio in inflation adjusted fixed percentage terms the sequencing risk increases exponentially.  On a reasonable risk weighted basis bonds increase the safe draw rate from a portfolio. So you are wrong about dividends holding you over unless the draw is small (about 2.5%), at around 4-6% the won't be close to enough.  This gets even worse if you have sudden large expenses (like a health crisis) which in real life happens.   There are a lot of good studies on this and the discussion is complicated here is a sample article I did on controlling sequencing risk day 1 of retirement: https://www.reddit.com/r/IncomeInvesting/comments/dhb50v/glidepaths_to_control_sequencing_risk/ .  I also did a little lesson on increasing intuition about sequencing risk: https://www.reddit.com/r/IncomeInvesting/comments/e9d80z/testing_your_intuition_about_sequencing_risk/

Now we get to the middle years.  The best risk adjusted return is from a 25% stock / 75% bond portfolio.  The problem is that while risk adjusted returns are great absolute returns aren't.  So you can either increase returns by increasing leverage (something like: 75% stock / 225% bonds / -200% cash) or by just shifting from bonds into stocks.  Since mutual funds and most investors dislike leverage they do the later.  But note that as they do this and up the stock portion risk adjusted returns are getting **worse** not better.  Not going all the way to 100/0 but stopping at 80/20 ends up decreasing return by a little in exchange for increasing risk adjusted return by a lot.  Which is where the traditional ""growth investor 80/20"" comes from.  60/40 in or near retirement for someone with a large portfolio works well.  It also works well for people who can't stand portfolio volatility and are willing to sacrifice a moderate amount of return to reduce it. Lifestrategy funds have to balance out the ideal 80/20 with keeping clients from acting self destructively.   Stocks below 60% the return hit is too high except for near end of life.  Though 60/40 I'd mention still has too much stock to support a very high draw like 10% annually, which investors are often doing near end of life.  You'll often see strategy funds go very high bonds for people in their 80s and 90s for this reason.

As an aside annuities work even better than bonds (since humans die and then don't need the money) and the USA is developing the mechanics to allow lifestrategy funds to hold annuities.",JeffB1517,3,/r/investing/comments/lndh1s/necessity_of_bonds_in_a_portfolio/go07cai/,0.082,0.837,0.081,0.107

“HIGH PROFITS AT LOW RATES: THE BENEFITS OF BOND CONVEXITY”

https://portfoliocharts.com/2019/05/27/high-profits-at-low-rates-the-benefits-of-bond-convexity/

I’m not sure I’m qualified to TL;DR it but my take-away (perhaps wrong?) is that a bond fund behaves differently than an individual bond and is not as poor an investment as a low prevailing interest rate would suggest. Bond funds constantly sell underlying bonds before their maturity dates, and the value of the fund INCREASES as rates DECREASE.

Disclosure: I use a 60/40 stock/bond asset allocation. My rationale to date has been similar to yours - it reduces volatility and gives better outcomes than an all stock or all bond portfolio.

33,RH," I just ran the numbers assuming 7-10% growth. You can also use excel along with historic return data if you wanted to back test it. But I just wanted to get a general idea. 

And it's not likely to go tits up, but you'll see volatility increase. And downside moves are amplified just like the upside, so you're not gaining any alpha.

Then consider the hurdle rate of exceeding the interest on the margin amount, which is usually around 4% (unless you go to one of these smaller brokers like IB, but we've seen how smaller shops like RH have faired). When most analysts are predicting forward returns of 5-7%, you're not really gaining much. And if the market happens to trade sideways for a few years (instead of these quick hit bear markets), you're just losing that 4%.

You just finished uni and you're already investing? That's AWESOME. Whatever regular income you generate over the next year, put a chunk of it into an IRA or Roth IRA and invest in a low-fee index fund like Vanguard or Fidelity. Then do the same thing the next year, and the year after. That's the pot you'll come back to years from now, when you're really ready to make waves.

AFTER YOU'VE HIT YOUR SAVINGS TARGET FOR THE YEAR, you can use additional money to play specific stocks, if you really want. Put a hard cap on those investments and anticipate that you'll lose them all.

68,BA," The only thing I had was BA when that 2nd plane crashed I got out of there completely. I sold it in the 300's and the next month it had dropped to about $95 (with some help with the market drop in march). I probably would have gotten back in under $100 but they stopped the dividend. Usually big things like that gives some good buying opportunities. You just don't want to take that ride down with them. 

Sell 10 shares for 3000 and buy 30 shares for 3000 when it dips to 100. Sounds easier than it is. Sometimes you have to take that high risk high reward getting back into the stock where you think the bottom is. But you never really know if it's the true bottom and how long is it going to suspend dividends.

Options are $.65 per contract so depends on volume and price if you want to trade options.  

Robinhood has free options trading and I have a small account there I am working to grow strictly with options selling.  Some of them are low premium trades so if I am paying .65 on a $5 or $10 premium contract it can add up and take away from my gains.

If you want margin, also look at margin fees and rates, especially if you plan to continuously utilize it.

**How should I allocate the $15.5k?**  Should I split it 70/30 in VTSAX and VTIAX?  Should I get some bonds?  (I don’t want very much in bonds since I’m relatively young and bonds aren’t doing too hot AFAIK)

It seems the price changes follow pretty much the same pattern, but is there a big difference in volume for example? Are those threats of potential delistings still relevant?",Boelens,1,/r/investing/comments/lnca8g/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gnzuusp/,0.049,0.86,0.092,0.4503

155,UK," >So theoretically, if I have $5000 in cash ready to invest in a fund, etf, stock, etc. does it make more sense to invest it all at once lump-sum or to spread that amount into equal size investments once a month?

See [this post I made on this topic yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/llr1yi/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gns1b5g/):

>An [oft-cited Vanguard study](http://www.smartretirement.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/7.23.2012_Dollar-cost_Averaging.pdf) found that on average, across various countries (US, UK, and Australia) and time periods (1926-2011 in US, 1976-2011 in UK, 1985-2011 in AUS) lump-sum investing a block of cash saw better returns than dollar-cost averaging it in over the course of a year (in a particular portfolio: 60% local stocks, 40% local bonds) about 2/3rds of the time. Thus, on the assumption that we retail investors can't time the market (so any attempt to guess at ""But THIS time we're in the 33% bucket!"" is a fools' errand), I generally just play the numbers: lump-sum does better than DCA 2/3 times, so invest my investable dollars as soon as I get them. 

>On the other hand, that same study only saw lump-sum beating DCA by an average of around 2% (2.3% for US, 2.2% UK, 1.3% AUS) after 10 years. That particular 2% number is specific to all the variables of that study (the country, the time period, and the portfolio), but demonstrates a basic qualitative point: although lump-sum seems to historically beat DCA, it's not by a *huge* margin. So, if you think you'll see a psychological benefit from DCA'ing, that may be worth an anticipated couple percent underperformance.

As for the rest

>Any advice for making up this loss in my Roth IRA? I still want to stay in the higher risk tolerance group but am also afraid of screwing up again.

I get that it's a sucky feeling, but if you ""just graduated college"" (I suppose you could be an older grad, but I'm assuming this means you're young) this is a marathon, not a sprint. Take this as a learning experience and move on.

Having *anything* saved for retirement at such a young age means you're already pretty well ahead of the curve. I would say stick to broad index fund / target date fund type holdings for your retirement portfolio. If you save enough to have some ""play"" money, I guess you could do funkier things with that if you like, but you could also just plow it into the same type of portfolio (it's what I do).",throwawayinvestacct,1,/r/investing/comments/lnca8g/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/go0dw3r/,0.041,0.861,0.097,0.966

But business travel oriented stocks like British airways, United etc may still struggle until at least 2022, maybe later. Another option would be tencent, this is risky, as it has a low earnings per share, meaning investors are betting on its long term growth, which from my own research there potentially is, but you could also just ride the wave and cash out when you made enough. There is some stock analysis on tencent, as well as a video on the company as a whole by polymatter (not from an investing standpoint).
