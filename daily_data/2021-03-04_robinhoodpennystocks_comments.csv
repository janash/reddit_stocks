112,AEZS," While this doesn't follow or fit with our normal structure here I'm doing an experiment. Instead of buying into the new BUZZ ETF, I'm doing something slightly diff.

I'm taking $100 and structuring based only on the top 50% of their holdings, and taking another $100 and structuring on the bottom 50% of their holdings.

Fractional shares of course so in my opinion falls under my penny portfolio, but I'm going to have that ETF on a watchlist before actually jumping into the way they have it structured.

Pennies for today - as I'm finally expecting volatility to decrease and think next week we are going to start going more sideways all my penny plays are options contracts. Just because they are cheap and I'm not opening positions in shares this week. So I'm grabbing these at the morning dip when they seem cheapest and seeing how they look. My confidence is low on the below three, but I'm in the mood for risk.

Just outside of penny territory so this doesn't apply to the sub and don't expect a lot of anyone to be interested. My only position I'm entering today and all week, aside from averaging down, is a new position in Ammo (POWW).

There is a bunch of complicated equations to determining the value of a contract that someone more intelligent than me would have to explain. If you wish to use this right which is called “Excerise” you will have to have 200$ in your account to purchase the shares for a dollar. Or you can sell the contract to a buyer for profit. The break even price is what you need to make a profit. You paid for the option so any return you make you must subtract your original investment.

Look at 5 year histories for a bunch of different stocks. They go up and down. Some go down for a while then rebound. Some may not. Some might go to the moon. That's the risk of the stock market and all you can do is your best to minimize your risk of losing. The market is very volatile right now and you just have to be patient.

234,TXMD," Awesome, I'm playing TXMD too, so it's an easy example.  
Right now, you can sell March 19 calls at .13 for 1.50 or .08 for 2.  
So, if you sell the $1.50 call for 1 contract at .13, you are going to make $13 for contract.    
This makes your actual cost of the stock 1.62 per share.  
($1.75 - .13)  
So that's not a great move, if it hit's $1.50, you are going to sell your shares for $1.50, and come out at a loss.  
So, you do the $2, your actual cost becomes $1.75 - .08 $1.67.  If you get assigned, you earn $2.00 - $1.75 = .25 per share, times 100 shares, you make the $25 plus the $8 in premium, or $32 per contract.  
BUT, if the stock doesn't hit your strike or higher, you keep your shares, and pocket the premium.  
If the stock keeps dropping before 3/19, you can always Buy to Close the option and sell at a lower strike.  
For TXMD, I'm selling 4/16 $1 calls.  I got $56 per contract on the premium.  Right now, I can Buy to Close and net a $13 per contract gain, then sell a longer expiry call for more.    
Not that mine is an ITM call, which is not a great move, since I don't want to get assigned.  
The ONLY reason I did it is because I've been wheeling it so long that my actual cost is around $.80 so I'm coming out ahead no matter what, and I kind of want the stock off my board.

353,GME," What happened with SLGG, especially that 4.00 - 5.75 overnight jump seemed to be pretty specifically tied to a WSB post. 

It was posted around 4pm Wednesday, ""explaining"" that Ryan Cohen's ice cream and frog tweet was a reference to a possible takeover/partnership between GME and SLGG - all based on the fact that Ann Hand, SLGG CEO, previously held positions at Project Frog and McDonalds. 

I was browsing WSB New and saw it early, I honestly thought it was stupid, but so stupid that the theory could gain traction in WSB. In a complete gut feeling hype-play I bought in at 4.03 AH and sold at open at 5.6. The post garnered around 4k upvotes with pretty high visibility before being removed the next morning.

That being said, it's just a theory, and the stock was rising previously to that post - might have been primed to pop anyway, it just so happened to coincide with that post.
