I kept upping my bid to match the ask, even exceeded the ask price at one point, and still couldn't buy shares. Before you ask, yes I was using the correct order type (GTEM for my particular brokerage), it's how I bought my GME shares in the first place, pre-squeezy.

It is better to go with a better broker in the long run so minor inconvenience will be well worth the trouble.

134,GME," Look, I’m in no way a fan of how shitty some hedge funds can be, but I feel like it’s disingenuous to say that hedge funds only help the rich get richer. What about all the “day traders” in this sub? I see people dumping thousands of dollars into a single stock and when they lose thousands they are just like “oh well, on to the next”. There are tons of people who’s retirement depends on hedge funds. Now some of them were wealthy before, but some have put their life’s savings in hoping they can finally relax.

195,API," BlackBerry. 

In 2015 I had a BlackBerry Z10. I remember rocking my baby girl for her afternoon nap when I updated my Facebook app and suddenly it stopped working. The ""update"" redirected me to the browser.   

  At first, I was done with BlackBerry. Why would they let that happen?  What kind of business model would screw their customers out of one of the most popular apps out there

   It took some digging, and I learned that there was a feud between the decision makers at BB and FB, in which BlackBerry felt that Facebook was playing fast and loose with users' privacy data. BB didn't want to play ball, and so FB blocked access to their API.  
 
   Remember, this was well before the 2016 election.
 
   I followed the company closely since then. I figured that if they felt security and privacy were important enough to sever ties with the most powerful social media empire, that was a mentality I could get behind. Later on there was another incident where the Pakistani government demanded access to BB's servers. They denied, and ended up getting out out of Pakistan. Completely. Again, this little company valued the privacy of their customers so much that it was worth losing out on a huge market. Then there was that other time when the US government deemed BB to be the ONLY software system secure enough to earn some special contract. Even now, the relationship between BlackBerry and the Chinese government is... thorny.
 
   A pattern emerges. Point blank, while companies like Apple decided privacy was important only after it was good PR, BlackBerry under John Chen's leadership has been in this game since before it was cool.  
 
  I value that, not just because of the degree of commitment required to make those sacrifices, but because of the forethought that goes into seeing the market demand for privacy a decade in advance.  
 
   Wall Street goons can analyze out their bungholes and come up with a dozen reasons to short BB; they're still wrong.  They can talk some smack about their ""fundamentals.""  How's this: BlackBerry's business model treats privacy and security as basic fundamentals, and THAT has value.  Short squeeze or no, BlackBerry is not going anywhere but up. all the talk is QNX,  IVY, the NSA and the Amazon partnership, but they're missing the big picture.",MontaukMonster2,52,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lnum6u/started_with_1200_almost_2_years_ago_and_turned/go2xtng/,0.071,0.839,0.09,0.5907

209,BBBY," Yeah, you definitely need to have an out strategy along with only allocating whatever you feel “okay” with potentially losing on options. Just because the stock doesn’t hit the strike price doesn’t mean YOU can’t turn a profit, even big profits, and it still ends up worthless. 

Give you a real example of myself recently. 

BBBY was doing their quarterly earnings update and I read a DD on here that I liked and thought they’d have good earnings. So I bought 49 $30 2/05 calls on BBBY at $.20 price ($20 per contract, $980 total). I was okay with potentially losing that $980 because I saw a potential upside. Turns out earnings weren’t that great and the stock only moved a little bit. I eventually sold them for $.90 ($90 each) for a total of $4410. So I made a great profit. 

Wellllllll a week later BBBY was one of those stocks caught up in the GME frenzy and it shot up high. Those same options I sold at $.90 each? They got to a peak of like $22.50 (i can’t remember exact price) in late January. So I potentially could have made $110k on those 49 contracts. 

What happens over the course of the next week? Robinhood and other brokers halt buying if that stock, it goes back down to below $30 by the 2/05 expiry date. So whoever owned it at that time, it was worthless for them. But I sold two weeks prior and made 450% returns. And they could have been much much more.

211,GME," Yeah, you definitely need to have an out strategy along with only allocating whatever you feel “okay” with potentially losing on options. Just because the stock doesn’t hit the strike price doesn’t mean YOU can’t turn a profit, even big profits, and it still ends up worthless. 

Give you a real example of myself recently. 

BBBY was doing their quarterly earnings update and I read a DD on here that I liked and thought they’d have good earnings. So I bought 49 $30 2/05 calls on BBBY at $.20 price ($20 per contract, $980 total). I was okay with potentially losing that $980 because I saw a potential upside. Turns out earnings weren’t that great and the stock only moved a little bit. I eventually sold them for $.90 ($90 each) for a total of $4410. So I made a great profit.

212,PLTR," I usually go about 3 months to expiry (yes, more expensive, but its basically insurance and you can still get 200%+ gains within a week or 2 if it does rocket) and look at a chart to see where it will realistically get to. Be risky/optimistic but don't completely gamble. Like you wouldn't buy a March Tesla $2000 call, it wont happen. But something like a May $1000 call is pretty much guaranteed.

Also be in at least 4 or so well-thought-out positions, so if one swiftly drops 50%+ you've still possibly got a 100%+ gain amongst them to cancel it out.

I've gone from about $60k worth of deposits to a $175k account since November and 90% of that has been buying calls. I used to have a rule about maximum $1k per position and now I've raised it to $4k.

SOLO was my first options trade ever where I made like 400% in a week when the shares went from $7 to $14. You can be sitting on a lot of losing positions and still be far ahead when you get the cream of the crop trades like that.


Another consideration is if something has violently dropped or otherwise been volatile you don't want to be buying calls as you're paying too much and can lose money just from the volatility settling down (even if the share price doesn't fall). In that situation you would want to sell puts instead, a bit out of the money, as someone is paying you that premium based on their fear of it falling further. For example with PLTR on 18th Feb it was quite volatile but also exactly on the trendline at $25. I did buy calls on that and am up 120% in a day.

240,GME," Yes the market will collapse because the hedge funds keep manipulate it, drive the price down and try all the way to spread FUD, instead of admit that was their fault, accept loss. Their gamble habit, arrogant and greedy will bring the whole market to the ground, not us. 

If GME continue spike last time and short squeeze happened, it will be around thousand per share.

If GME squeze happen next week or later, the price will be multi thousand per share, at the Short rate and Short Interest now must be much higher, because they keep short ladder GME. They will soon have to sell all the other stocks they have to get money and cover loss, withdraw all the investment, and this will sure cause chain effect. If this happened 3 week ago, it would be a small one. If this happened now, it is a big one. If it happens next week or later, it would be a huge huge huge one, as the longer they stall, the bigger consequence.

Potentially “Unlimited loss”, wtf is that? Unlimited?? 

Can you just give me a ballpark number how much is unlimited? How does one calculate how much liquidity youd need to keep on hand for unlimited? Like how could you possibly know bc unlimited isn’t a number.. that shit doesn’t belong anywhere in the market. 

So what happens if the price gets driven through the roof again and nobody sells while the shorts bleed billions in premiums until Citadel and co go down? JP Morgan foots a potentially unlimited bill?? 

That’s something that could potentially topple the market. 

130k seems silly to me but I’m literally autistic so what the fuck do I know. But even if they had to buy 38million at 10k that’s $380 billion. Or maybe it’s 1k a share for $38billion. Or $unlimited? That’s insane 😂

271,GME," The market operates mostly with IOUs. When someone ""owns"" a share, 99% of the time it's just that they own the rights to said share and they only own it in principle. They are not really counting the total number of shares every time there is a transfer of shares and making sure the total amount is not exceeded.

The reason this works is because everybody is basically banking on the fact that there will never be a scenario where **every** shareholder is going to demand that their shares are handed over **at the same time**. This is the same phenomenon that allows Ponzi schemes to persist (before they get caught).

So the market will continue operating not caring that there are more shares being transferred than in existence because they are not really worried that they won't be able to produce the physical shares if there ever comes a time where they have to.

Think of how much money they spend on QE propping up the market. Why would they let a squeeze destroy the market?

I’ll post some bullet points for those whose ass cheeks tighten up on Reddit when someone mentions DM. 

. . . . 

*Chase Coleman III, 45, head of Tiger Global, topped Bloomberg's 2020 list of the top-earning hedge fund managers this week.*

*Coleman, descendant of New York's last Dutch governor in the 1600s, Peter Stuyvesant, landed at No. 1 on Bloomberg's annual list of the top-earning hedge fund managers this week after adding $3billion to his fortune last year.*

*Collectively, the 15 hedge fund managers on the list added $23.2billion to their personal fortunes in a year that saw the global economy battered by the coronavirus pandemic and accompanying lockdowns - more than the annual GDPs of Iceland or Zambia.*

*Some of his well-timed holdings? Pandemic darlings Zoom, which has gained 390 percent over the past year and Peloton, which is up more than 118 percent over the same time frame.*

*The number crunchers at Bloomberg called Coleman's holdings 'a portfolio almost perfectly positioned for the unprecedented experience of billions of people stuck at home'.*

*His fund as a whole returned 48 percent in 2020, far outstripping the broader US stock market, which gained around 16 percent.*

*Meanwhile, not all of the people on the 2020 list did so well: No. 15 last year, Gabe Plotkin, head of Melvin Capital, lost around $460million personally, Bloomberg reports, in his bet against GameStop as retail investors pushed into the retailer and led its stock sharply higher.*

*Coleman, on the other hand, already has an estimated fortune of $4.5billion, according to Forbes, which ranked him as the 458th richest person in the world in 2019.*

**He is the founder of Tiger Global Management (TGM), which he set up at just 24 years old after being given the $25million seed money by Julian Robertson, the founder of Tiger Management, when he closed his fund in 2000.**

*Coleman, who grew up in the affluent Glen Head community on Long Island, New York, connected with Robertson through the elder's son Spencer, who he was good friends with. 
While he has largely invested in new technologies, Coleman's wealth goes back generations.*

**He is a descendant of Peter Stuyvesant, the last Dutch governor of New York who ordered the construction of the wall after which Wall Street is named.**

*Stuyvesant surrendered New Amsterdam, now New York, to the English in 1664.*

**Coleman is a major donor to the Republican party and supported Mitt Romney's 2012 campaign. He has also donated to Democratic candidates including New York Governor Andrew Cuomo.** 

*Renaissance Technologies' Jim Simons came in second place having made $2.6billion, while Israel Englander of Millennium Management was ranked third with $2.2billion.*

*Other entrants included New York Mets owner Steve Cohen, who made $1.6billion at Point 72 and Pershing Square's Bill Ackman, who made billions for the fund betting that stock markets would collapse early in the pandemic. Ackman took home $1.3billion.*

*The rewards are 'unlike anything the hedge-fund industry has ever seen,' Bloomberg reported, with experts noting that the earnings illustrate the gulf between the super rich and the rest of the world more starkly than ever due to the pandemic, which has ravaged many businesses and drained personal savings.*

Also...

*He and his (socialite wife) purchased an entire floor of a building on Fifth Avenue from Veronica Hearst, daughter-in-law of William Randolph Hearst, for $36.5million in 2008, before buying another 15-room unit in the building for $52million in 2016.*

*They also have a $19million property in Southhampton, New York, from which Coleman has been known to take a helicopter to the city for work.*

My uneducated thoughts say that the only 3 things you can truly point to that is fact based is that RH was undercapitalized, the DTCC's methodology for determining capital requirements for stocks based on volatility, and short reporting rules.

I could see a reason why they would want to maybe increase capital requirements for brokerages/clearing houses. And they would want to start having shorts report their positions for more market transparency.

446,RH," DTCC amended the formula for the amount of collateral required from RobinHood from 1-2% collateral to nearly 100% collateral from my understanding. It went from $126 million to $3 billion in collateral required. 


DTCC basically told RH to give them $3 billion or else the RH portfolio and all customer accounts would be liquidated. Not a good look for RH, since their IPO was around the corner, eh?


Robinhood shoots back “what if we just restrict purchasing on these specific stocks,” and the DTCC agreed to reduce the $3B of collateral required to ~$1.6B, which is when RH allegedly began allowing **super limited** purchasing

469,GME," Now I can't tell if I'm being downvoted by the cult or by people who don't understand the difference between short and long term plays and why people make them.

Long term plays are made on fundamentals, with a bit of sentiment and a touch of technical analysis. 

Short term plays of companies are based mostly on technical analysis, with a small part focusing on derivatives, a bit of sentiment and a touch of fundamentals.

Mid term plays are based mostly on sentiment, bit on technicals and a little on fundamentals.

In January, it was a *very* good short, mid term play. The reason why is because again, for short term, fundamentals barely matter. When people looked at the option greeks, you'd see decent deltas, high gammas, high vegas. Implied Volatility (before fhe squeeze) was comparatively low, and this is mean reverting. Sentiment was also increasing to the positive, based on nothing but the technicals and the hate of Wall Street and stress by the pandemic. 

It was, and still *is* a good long term play. DFV's initial analysis was spot on. The company is a ""dying business"", but has the potential to change their position. To be a better version of Steam. Maybe even the new Gamefly (remember gamefly?). With Cohen on board, there was even more positive outlook. With this frenzy, it gets to the news. All publicity is good publicity. If you look at the implied volatility, it is *very* high. Assuming it stays constant, in one year, it can (with roughly 40% chance) hit $80-160. Yes, IV mean reverting, so it's more likely to hit $60-130. But it also means it *won't* go back to $4/share (probabalistically).

Short term (i.e. for all the bagholders), it is an absolutely horrible play. IV is high, mean reverting, and the only reason why I don't have credit spreads on GME is because the orders spread width is too high for the potential payout where I'm comfortable.

A new mean has been set, in my mind I'd say somewhere between $30-50 a share.

Now, it all depends on what the company does. It is do or die time for them. If they successfully switch their model into e-commerce, they will come bank from the brink of overdose on stupidity, Cohen being the naloxone injection straight to the heart. But if they dawdle, they will die. I imagine they are nof stupid enough to dawdle.

Ironically, the same reasoning (but changing of time-term) is why I'm thinking in the short term while the pandemic is ending (slowly) is a good time for $DASH, mid term and long term they are a failing business and I'm thinking of doing weekly credit spreads until I gain enough capital for LEAP puts.",13steinj,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lo1zr6/welcome_to_gme_park/go4w0lt/,0.095,0.788,0.117,0.7449

But I’ll try and give you some clues.

GME has members who play video games.
Netflix has members who watch movies thru platform.
They each charge for services. 
GME develops platform where users can play games, buy sell/sell/trade online without having to go buy games in stores, etc...possibly? Similar to how Netflix is where people dont have to go buy movies at a store. 

GME now becomes industry standard in gaming world like netflix is in movie world with more and more paid memberships and a stronghold on the gaming world like Netflix is to movies.

How many commodities are nearly half the price that they were over 40 years ago? And if there is another big run in the silver price, imagine what the top would be if the top from over 40 years ago was around \~$50 an ounce. There is huge upside potential if silver goes on a run. Of course there is downside, but I think the downside is fairly limited. Maybe it goes back to $20. Slim chance it would go to $15. Anything lower than this would probably require a huge stock market crash. So realistically, silver at $27 is quite attractive. It's almost certainly going to be higher than that in the long run. Downside seems fairly limited. Upside is massive. 

Physical precious metals like gold and silver in your possession hidden in your house is kind of like financial insurance. All your other financial assets are basically digital and can be taken from you with the click of a mouse. With physical metals, someone actually has to take it from you. If you do buy physical, invest in a fireproof safe or box. Hide it somewhere clever where no one would think to look. And DON'T TELL ANYONE! I repeat, DON'T TELL ANYONE.

PSLV physically buys silver to keep up with their demand but you need to take possession of 10000oz which is ridiculous for retailers. Plus no options of PSLV. A positive feedback loop could be exploited in SLV but many don't like it because they changed their prospectus earlier this month saying that they may not be able to source the physical silver. If silver prices move up SLV with have hard time since it will decouple from the actual silver price 

Now this isn't to say SLV will go down, I think it will spike up with the price of silver and will add a lot of premium to the contracts since backwardation is currently being seen on futures where they want people to delay taking physical delivery. 

Jeff Curry is a piece of shit and openly lied on CNBC the other day where he said a squeeze could not happen due to them buying physical and selling/shorting on the COMEX but if you look at their website it explicitly States they do not do this and are not allowed. 

My plays are AG and SLV a few months out, i saw what happened to the physical premium earlier this month and how much it affected the option chains with loads of premiums.

Keep in mind precious metals can take some time to develop price action and I don't play these often but this upcoming week I'm very excited to see price action. They tried dumping silver earlier this week in afterhours and my heart sank. The price rejected all lower levels and came back up to where it was before and even higher.

I think they're running out of steam and silver is going to $40-50 very soon and I will be selling my options when that happens as I don't know how long it can stay up there will all the nonsense Jp Morgan does

very good fundamentals for silver to go MUCH higher next few weeks.

I think they're running out of steam and silver is going to $40-50 very soon and I will be selling my options when that happens as I don't know how long it can stay up there will all the nonsense Jp Morgan does

Tl;Dr 
very good fundamentals for silver to go MUCH higher next few weeks. 
Huge shortage and lending rate has spiked the past week
PAAS 25% revenue from silver is okay but not the best exposure, I'm in AG and SLV even though I know SLV options means you are lending others to short silver, but I think squeeze happens bigly on SLV

So if I am understanding you correctly this “squeeze” happens this coming week around the 24th OR the May delivery dates? So basically any option trades should be a few months out and any shares should be held at least until after the May delivery dates?

I purchased my SLV before doing DD on PSLV, but my new purchases will go towards PSLV. Also worth mentioning, silver is decoupling from gold right now because of its industrial use and inflation whereas gold is a mostly a monetary metal only and is showing temporarily showing signs of weakness due to rising real interest rates. Interest rates will reverse and go in gold favors soon because CB’s will start purchasing long dated treasuries (aka yield curve control) otherwise credit markets will get fucked and stock markets will get obliterated.",3ptmikan,37,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lnzeho/the_silver_short_squeeze_is_glaringly_obvious_to/go4jetj/,0.081,0.77,0.148,0.8176

580,DD," The narrativ was wrong from the start. The silver dd came at a time the whole media was checking WSB.
Again the media loved this and spun a boomer wet dream story out of the one silver DD.
“Reckless Millennials rally Silver”
This creates clicks and it’s a perfect content for advertisers that sell precious metals. 
Lots of media outlets copy the story for the clicks and being in the search to generate clicks for the advertiser for month. Lots of financial sites are sponsored by precious metal seller.
There was no conspiracy behind this just self interest of the media outlets to make money.

Something strange happened suddenly lots of people were talking it’s a citadel operation because of their 0.51% holding in $SLV. That’s laughable... even when I check random small caps citadel hold a chunk they are a fucking hedge fund... they invest in everything. It’s just their inflation hedge. 

I guess that was the moment they knew they will win and how retarded WSB is. Sorry 💎🙌🏼 😂 

Lots of people became anti silver.

607,DD," It's way bigger than that. Preppers make up a tiny part of the silver market, and honestly seem more into canned food and ammo anyway.

The unique thing about silver is that it is both a much sought after commodity (used in tech, solar panels, EV etc) AND a store of value / monetary metal.

With the amount of money printing going on all over the world, the silver price should be EXPLODING higher on both accounts. One because of inflation, which is causing all commodities to rise, and two, because FIAT currency like the USD is basically turning into dust by the minute.

Only reason silver (and gold) hasn't exploded yet, like the other commodities have, is because of their status as a monetary metal, which make them a direct competitor to the USD as a store of value, which is why bullion banks are shorting paper silver into oblivion with the blessings of the FED.

C\*\*\*to is also a competitor to FIAT, and I hold some for that reason, but it has already seen a significant run, which the metals haven't. While I recommend holding both, if you are worried about the dollar holding its value, I feel safer allocating a larger size of my portfolio to silver at current prices.

Wow! This could not be further from the truth.   


Melvin... Here's a guy who has been involved in insider trading before and other nefarious practices to manipulate markets. Here's guy who has been aggressive shorting Gamestop for years, and years, and refused to admit there might be a turn-around possible. Here's a guy that even while the price surged to $40, to $60, to $120, refused to cover. Who instead ran to his friends for a $3B bailout. And you bet your ass that he took that $3B, got 10X leverage, and SHORTED GME again at $100, at $200, at $400. And when everything was about the blow up he called up Citidel and said ""Hey, can you kill the demand on this stock please?"" and Citidel called up Robinhood and said ""I will destroy your company unless you take a huge PR hit to the balls. But don't worry 'cause I'll invest a few more billion in you and you'll still be rich"". THAT is all the definition of greedy. That is the definition of the worst aspect of the financial markets and the massive influence they wield.   


DFV on the other hand...... Here is a man who invested $60k or so- which was A LOT, in fact everything he had, on a belief of being right on an under-valued company. Here's a man who watched his thesis come true in December 2020, making him a millionaire. That wasn't greed, that was good research, some guts, and some luck (Cohen joining was a godsend). And when DFV had calls worth millions as the stock surged to $100, to $200, to $400... He did not sell. That wasn't greed. That was integrity. He realized he was an inspiration to everyone and his actions spoke volumes. He could have offloaded his calls at any of these peaks and he did not. And the most amazing thing... At $40 something... He buys 50,000 more shares, because again... It's under-valued!

Also mathematically if you look at the volume you would know that they can’t have covered. Because I’m pretty sure 1+1 doesn’t equal 10

Also ORTEX and Finra published multiple times conflicting Short Interest and the low short interest is a result from another formula.

I have probably spent over 60 hours worth of DD on this stock and even if you are not a believer in the short squeeze, GME at this price is just underpriced.",akvarista11,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lo0ihf/18k_of_savings_from_minimum_wage_jobs_into_gme/go5djn5/,0.039,0.79,0.172,0.9382

752,GME," Let’s unpack this, shall we? 
1. You’re asking if it would be smarter to actually invest... on r/wsb? Congratulations Sherlock, go hang with Warren Buffet because you’ve figured out that being a trader 99% of the time means you’re going to lose money. Go join the other grooved brains in r/investing since you’re a real “investor”.
2. You pulled out of GME, mind you at a loss, when what should’ve happened is your dad pulling out of your mom and preventing us from having this interaction. GG
3. While I may be coming off harsh, I hope you know it’s all in good spirit. At the end of the day we’re all here to make money. Glad to hear you’re on your way back up the hill, but I am disappointed in your pride at 2.5% on WSB. Brag about it on some other subs and I’m sure you’ll be treated as a king there. But here, unfortunately you must be recognized as nothing more than a nephew. 
4. Finally, fuck you for insulting GME hodlers. This isn’t a miracle we’re awaiting. We like the stock. Fundamentally, yes it’s overvalued. But so’s Tesla. It’s much more about future expectations of growth and improved revenues and market share of an ever growing $200B gaming industry. The only time I sit on my hands is to give myself a nice Stranger, and even that’s only when your wife’s too busy reading you a bedtime story and tucking you in Mr. Proactive “I sold my GME for a loss and am going to cry when it hits $500 in the future” Investor.",wafflebrainCPA,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lo0ihf/18k_of_savings_from_minimum_wage_jobs_into_gme/go3zstg/,0.096,0.731,0.172,0.9665

He built something called Chewy.com and made everyone involved a pretty penny. Let's be honest, he's probably not going to ask for your help. In fact I think he and his team are going to do so well I bought quite a few shares. 

You and your friends were probably surprised when TSLA didn't go down but I bet GME has y'all a little worried. You can't just go around spreading your lies and coordinating you're games at will and without repercussions.

821,IBKR," > Did Gill not see that any plan that the now invincible, magical Ryan  Cohen could come up with would never get the stock to $300 and that  shorts to go bust alleviating the pressure upward? Did he really think  that GameStop had the money on hand to expand to adjacencies? Did he  honestly know retail at all? Or was it all from the percentage short  which meant there was a price to declare victory at? 

Yo Cramer, you're either misleading people or stupid as fuck. I know you're not stupid as fuck so you're purposefully misleading people. In the middle of a gamma squeeze who the fuck is selling? The main man at IBKR said himself it was going in to the thousands if someone didn't halt the trading on the buy side. DFV cashed out many times more than his initial cost before the squeeze. When it's likely to go higher than 300, and it's house money, who isn't letting that run? DFV isn't playing a war game like you sly hedgefund fucks. He's investing money smartly in companies he thinks are undervalued. Then he's playing the game and adjusting as it plays out. You're a fucking idiot. Fuck Cramer. Fuck all your friends and fuck your employers too. You're a hypocrite that should keep his mouth shut.

As a side note, I worked for a big electronics company that transformed itself over the course of 5 years. It realized that it had become mostly a showroom instead of a primaey place to make purchases. They refocused to better perform online and have become successful. Stock price went from low teens to hundreds. I see the potential for GME to do the same in its space.

823,GME," Read the room, Jim. Nobody is going to walk away from this one and it won't just magically go away.

The congressional hearing was a pro-retail win where institutional investors floundered for answers and DFV was a bronze victory statue by comparison, and the congressional hearing had more than half a million views so it's going to be a household conversation piece.

The only shorts exiting their positions are the ones that shorted at a high. Otherwise, it's totally possible that shorts are still underwater. Plus, with the initial negative perception you can count on people shorting more on the way up. This thing is going to get very buoyant very fast and rocket out of the water.

If someone is still long for GME then odds are good they're in the red. They'll average down during this fire sale and hold for the long term.

FUD about Ryan Cohen is silly. He built a pet supply business from the ground up and sourced an absolutely killer team composed of professionals that know what they're doing. So not only is he going to implement a proven business model, but this time he's got a head-start in an industry which in most regards is still in its infancy. As they say, smart money makes money, and Cohen is in it for the long term so you should be too, Mr. Cramer.

824,GME," I have no negative feelings towards Cramer and I'm skeptical of GameStop's value as a company, and I highly doubt GameStop will ever get anywhere near to its highs during the brouhaha, but he clearly doesn't understand DFV's thesis, most notably that GME could enhance its online presence like a Chewy for gaming.  I highly doubt GME's leadership will turn the company around, but come on, at least address what DFV thinks.   Clearly if GME is to turn itself around it will be a drastic change in business model (just like BlackBerry) and that's what DFV is banking on.

While I am a complete bear to GME, I hope I'm wrong and it would be one hell of a story for DFV to end up far, far wealthier in this gambit.  

I'm also hoping from all this that Congress reigns in things like shortselling and pre/postmarket purchasing where institutions have a clear and marked advantage.  Everyone knows the institutions play games with the stock price, such as shortselling to drive down the stock price to repurchase a significant holding at a bargain, it's clear as day when you look at stock activity, but the financial world just pretends none of it ever goes on and it's just wholly organic buying/selling.",ExtremeNihilism,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lnwdoq/fuck_jim_cramer/go3h8rt/,0.095,0.712,0.193,0.9746

I did make one round trip trade on GME on one of the most vilolent days in the 300’s without a problem.  On margin, Schwab went to 100% for longs and shorts before the huge run, then 200% for SHORT positions.

914,GME," Been trying to figure out if the following is true:

Inspite of reports, Fidelity did not leave GME.

https://fintel.io/so/us/gme

> GameStop Corp. (US:GME) has 490 institutional owners and shareholders that have filed 13D/G or 13F forms with the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC). These institutions hold a total of 109,434,643 shares. Largest shareholders include Fmr Llc, BlackRock Inc., FDMLX - Fidelity Series Intrinsic Opportunities Fund, Melvin Capital Management LP, Vanguard Group Inc, Senvest Management, LLC, Susquehanna International Group, Llp, Maverick Capital Ltd, Morgan Stanley, and Dimensional Fund Advisors Lp.

My understanding per above quote is that Fidelity has the holding now in their FDMLX - Fidelity Series Intrinsic Opportunities Fund. It used to be In their management and research LLC.

1028,GME," down 60k but after what i heard and saw during hearing going to buy more shares on Monday. can definitely put another 10k. 

This makes sense to me, since i will be reducing averages and i like the stock. 

I am with Fidelity. after phone discussion with them, they told me once my stocks in margin account, they are allowed to lent it.

So i immediately opened additional cash account (took me exactly 2 minutes) and transferred GME stocks i own there, so they cannot touch it. I know it was painful for them, as i had to call them to do so, as online option didnt allow me to. If we want the squeeze to happen, this is what everybody has to do.

From this ape brain, it seems like they are responding to RH's claim that trading was halted due to additional requirements set by DTCC, and that a fair amount of that additional requirement was waived due to negotiation between RH and DTCC, with the implication that RH's decision to halt trading resulted in DTCC's decision to waive the capital premium charges. 


Now DTCC has hit back to say that they actually waived this capital premium charges for all its members, and *did so right before the stock market opened*, which means that RH, by market open, was already aware that the $3billion requirement had dropped very substantially to a number they could conceivably manage. They are also categorically denying that they asked RH to impose trading restrictions, so now essentially RH and DTCC are accusing each other of lying.

1049,GME," I knew it would be there somewhere, had to search this document carefully for it:

‘Additionally, the real-time reconciliation and real-time stock records required for either T+0 or RTGS would be difficult for the industry to implement. There would be negative impacts to processing for short sales, the use of securities lending as a financing tool, and institutional trade processing operations’.

There it is in black and white: why they will not implement anything beyond T+2 anytime soon.

Here is what I wrote in response to the thread theorising that the GME squeeze has not yet been squozed:

‘Most of you missed one of the most telling exchanges during the Congressional hearing.

DFV was asked a question and responded ‘I don’t understand the settlement system’. we mostly agree he was the sharpest mind present - by a wide margin.

He was really saying it stinks.

It is not capable of rational analysis. Which is what this thread is all about. We can only GUESS what is really going on. One word: dark pools.

Then look again at Ken Griffin’s testimony when asked about real time settlement. Not just what he SAID, but his body language. ‘Not likely possible for another 2 or 3 years’.

Griffin, Plotkin & Co are utterly terrified of real time settlement. Scared witless. In an instant, it removes the asymmetric advantage they have. Forever.

Be very, very careful with this.’

Edit: in retrospect, it was all very carefully staged. Griffin knew exactly what to say when asked about T+2, and he knew Vlad would use it as an ‘excuse’ for what happened with the bonus of looking virtuous for suggesting ‘improvement’.

1052,GME," I took some time and ~~read through~~ pretended I understood the words used in NSCC's rules and policies. I have a few unanswered thoughts. 

**Capital Premium Charge**

I was curious what that massive ""capital premium charge"" was when I read the RH statement originally so I did a bit of reading into the NSCC's calculation. The RH written statement links to the NSCC's disclosure framework, which is a bit odd. The framework only mentions ""premium charge"" twice and only explains how it is triggered, not how the premium is calculated. So I went into the NSCC rules and procedures document (linked below) and found it. Roughly, it takes the difference between the requested clearing amount and the excess net capital and multiplies that difference by their ratio (premium only triggers when ratio is over 1). The greater the difference, the higher the ratio, and the heavier the premium. It reads that NSCC can waive some or all of the premium at their discretion. 

RH written statement, page 9, mentions capital premium: https://financialservices.house.gov/uploadedfiles/hhrg-117-ba00-wstate-tenevv-20210218.pdf

NSCC Disclosure Framework was found here: https://www.dtcc.com/legal

NSCC Rules and Procedures, page 300, describes the capital premium charge and NSCC's right to waive: https://www.dtcc.com/legal/rules-and-procedures.aspx

The NSCC rules document is obscenely dense but it does give some insight into the mechanics. Regarding the Clearing Fund calculation (capital cushion), the rules leave room for discretion. For example, from page 291 of the rules: 

>(d)  An additional payment (“special charge”) from Members in view of price fluctuations in or volatility or lack of liquidity of any security.  The Corporation shall make any such determination based on such factors as the Corporation determines to be appropriate from time to time

**Warning of Core**

The other part that confused me in this DTCC statement was this warning to clearing members comment. 

>NSCC provides a warning to clearing members in their daily clearing fund statements on any day that their core requirement exceeds 50% of their capital cushion, to remind them that this charge will be applied if their core requirement grows to exceed their capital cushion.

The way they describe the core requirement warning here suggests it is completely useless to actually warn the clearing member in a situation like GME. Such a warning is fine if day to day capital cushions aren't volatile, because it gives the clearing member actual notice with proper lead time before violation. But since NSCC VaR is calculated exponentially, when the clearing member has positions that suddenly become extremely volatile, the required capital cushion multiplies day to day. If it grows big enough, fast enough, it can trigger the warning and trigger the actual premium charge in the same daily fund statement. I'm surprised RH hasn't tried shifting the blame to the discretion used in calculating VaR or argued NSCC has a duty to disclose the the exact values used in their calcs on the week of the buy halt. I suppose don't bite the hand that feeds.

The weirder part is that I couldn't find anything in the rules about a 50% warning threshold relating to core. There is a DTCC Limit Monitoring risk management tool that NSCC Members are required to set up where they define data sets and assign parameters to those sets. At 75% and 90% parameter breach, the tool sends an early warning. I guess parameters can be set up for that 50% core/cushion trigger but it isn't mentioned.",OhwowTaux,6,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lnz6gt/dtcc_uploaded_the_letter_they_submitted_to/go41u1c/,0.097,0.867,0.036,-0.9891

It's likely based on something like ∑ (portfolio value)\*(% of portfolio)\*(volatility over the last 2 days), summed across all stocks. So for RH, GME likely was already pretty high in GME % of portfolio compared to other brokers, and the volatility shot up because it went up from $100 to $500 from 1/25-1/27 (with the $500 at exactly when NSCC sent the letter to RH)

Question

So if Robinhood had to block buyers of GME and other stocks because of increased NSCC deposit requirements, what's the other brokerages' excuse? Because it sounds to me like Robinhood had the largest increase due to largest proportion of meme stocks in its portfolio and had the lowest funds (because they're relatively small). These other brokerages like TD Ameritrade had much deeper pockets, yet they still blocked GME. Why?",WeeklysOnly,36,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lnz6gt/dtcc_uploaded_the_letter_they_submitted_to/go3bnfi/,0.048,0.846,0.106,0.7998
1061,RH," > Editing a second time to add: This is all aligned with Vlad's written statement, which now makes sense now that I have context on what these words mean. His written statement can be found here: https://financialservices.house.gov/uploadedfiles/hhrg-117-ba00-wstate-tenevv-20210218.pdf. The VaR was 1.3 billion; the excess capital charge started at 2.2 billion, was reduced, then removed entirely. I'll stop editing my post now; I realize it's bad form.

I was just drafting a reply to you to point this out. I was curious what ""capital premium charge"" was when I read the RH statement originally so I did a bit of reading into the NSCC's calculation. The RH written statement links to the NSCC's disclosure framework, which is a bit odd. The framework only mentions ""premium charge"" twice and only explains how it is triggered, not how the premium is calculated. So I went into the NSCC rules and procedures and found it. Roughly, it takes the difference between the requested clearing amount and the excess net capital and multiplies that difference by their ratio (premium only triggers when ratio is over 1). The greater the difference, the higher the ratio, and the heavier the premium. It reads that NSCC can waive the charge at their discretion. 


NSCC Disclosure Framework was found here: https://www.dtcc.com/legal

NSCC Rules and Procedures, page 300, describes the capital premium charge and NSCC's right to waive:

The DTCC facilitates the “buyers” and “sellers”. The risk of the seller producing a **real** share of GME was infinitely risky as we approached the infinity squeeze.

I imagine that RH was benefitting from the volatility.

So I believe they had very little real risk. The only problem is that the law requires brokers to provide collateral with their own funds, and not the funds of their users. So when the DTCC increased the collateral requirements to 100% from like 1 or 2% or whatever the regular amount is, they had a liquidity issue. The DTCC were the ones that were really fucked on the issue because the people on the other side of the trade,  ie the hedgefunds, didn't have the liquidity to cover and the DTCC would've had to foot the bill if they went bankrupt. so they decided to fuck all the brokers to cover their ass.

1107,GME," >Robinhood got margin called because most of the ""troublemakers"" bidding up GME and making its price volatile were its customers? 








Robinhood didn't get margin called. And, yes, if a brokerage has customers that make risky trades then their colleterial requirements will be higher. This isn't rocket science. 










>What about the muckers at Melvin who had to bid up the price to cover their shitty shorts? How come the NSCC didn't make them pony up collateral to cover their diamond shorts turned into total garbage?







Mevlin is a hedge fund and not a brokerage. So, they have no colleterial requirements with the DTCC and don't interact with the DTCC. The use a prime broker whose clients didn't trade outside their norms so they're prime broker was able to meet their colleterial requirements. The whole point of the DTCC is so that clients of brokerages can trade without worrying about the default risk of the counterparty (including you).
















 











>What they should have done is liquidate Melvin's long portfolio, not make RH put up more collateral. 









Why would they do that? These two things aren't related at all. 



















>They should have gone after the real bad actor, Melvin and other big shorts who went too far and their trade went south, not deny the profit taking of people who put technical pressure on their bad bet. 








How is Melvin a bad actor? How did the shorts go to far? The people who put pressure on the bad bet were mostly other hedge funds. 
















>People were not buying and bidding up the stock over valuations and fundamentals, it was a technical squeeze to extract a payout from one side of a trade position to another. Volatility? It was a rational if-then game theory with a known outcome, that they squashed mercilessly.

1129,LIVE," But even then 1200 is not life changing. Even if you’re paycheck to paycheck and that’s rent money, by definition it’s not life changing. It’s “month” changing but not life changing. Yolo obviously is “you only LIVE once” so imo it should be about a value amount that can change your life. In America is say there definitely is an absolute threshold about money that can be life changing. I’d say 10k should be the amount to post about but really it’s like 20k+ that’s like okay that could be enabling someone to go college who’s afraid about taking loans. That could be the ability to get out of a bad neighborhood, it could be a nice chunk of a down payment for a house depending where you live, or it could be a new car or a nice wedding. All those things I’d say are in the category of “life changing” so throwing that type of money at one trade would count for a yolo even if you’re so rich it doesn’t mean anything to you. 

Basically it’s not that hard, if it’s not enough money than just don’t post it. If it’s a lot to you that’s great, hope it works out just don’t post it cuz others like me don’t care.

1180,GME," *Thank you for giving me the opportunity to be here today and answer your question.*

Maybe this is wallstreetsbets fault for using a term like ""YOLO"" that is becoming a popular slang term for all types of activity, not just investing or gambling;  Now that the community has grown so much it doesn't belong to the OG's anymore.  A YOLO trade was supposed to be an options trade with an entry cost greater than $2500 or a stock trade worth over $10,000.  It was supposed to be risky, there were always going to be more losers than winners.  The new users are missing that point and ""yoloing"" $500 by diversification of stock.  The term doesn't apply like we defined it in the past.  Over half of the community (my rough estimate) here doesn't even know how to trade options.  A lot of people are losing money and will likely hang up their yolo hats and forget about this place.  They got swept up in a fad, invaded the community and left their mark on it. 

So lets just redefine it to mean investing in general, because lets face it, you really do only live once; and investing is inherently risky.  

And the advice was always to never invest more than you can afford to lose.  If you need your money for rent, food, shelter, transportation, etc. shouldn't be in a brokerage account.  If you need it for a down payment on a house, it shouldn't go into fucking GME during a period of extreme volatility.   I can relate and sympathize with new traders losing money, any trader that says they've never lost money is most likely lying.  You have to learn from your mistakes to be successful and you have to humble yourself to understand that there will always be curveballs.",patrickzr1,4,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lns70t/yolo_the_amount_you_can_afford_to_lose_avoid/go30xzg/,0.086,0.812,0.102,0.6354

1259,DD," I 100% believe this market is going to explode in the next 5-10 years. I have personally benefitted from clinical psychedelic therapy. If anyone is interested I've written about it extensively in my comment history dating back a few years. Basically, it cured me of lifelong anxiety as well as severe depression and PTSD from an incident a couple years ago. I was legitimately suicidal and it brought me back from the edge and turned my life around. I no longer have anxiety attacks and am happier than I've ever been in my life. 

I spent months researching the science and the methods before I did my therapy. I was on the fence about investing in the sector, not because I didn't believe in it and its potential, but because I was ethically unsure of whether I should benefit from it financially. Psychedelics are sacred to me and saved my life. I felt like that was probably enough and making money off of it was probably pushing it. Nonetheless, I've since decided that I will invest in it since it's going to make a lot of people a lot of money so why not be one of those people. 

I did some DD over time and steadily bought into several different companies, all mentioned in this post. I also recently sunk a bunch into the Horizons Psychedelic ETF $PSYK. If you're unsure of individual stocks to buy that's probably as safe a bet as there is. 

Lastly, since I bought in I've 5x my investment in the sector overall, but this is a long term play. Yes, there have been some crazy multipliers over the last year+ but I believe in this for the long haul and will continue to invest over time. 

Buckle up because it's gonna be a crazy trip ;)",amicantbelieve,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lo1imb/psychedelics_huge_value_for_an_emerging_and/go5jjhq/,0.078,0.822,0.1,0.872

1263,DD," Right play, wrong fucking DD. MMED is great, but #2(and maybe soon #1) in this space is TRYP. If you follow psychedelic research, you need to follow where the most reputable researchers join advisory boards. Right now those are TRYP and MMED. Everyone looking at the space has talked MMED for the last few months, but TRYP just added the preeminent mind of psychedelics over the last decade to its advisory board with the specific purpose of overseeing design and function of a psychedelic used to treat eating disorders. They added Robin Carhart-Harris from Imperial College in London. He has been published on over 90 papers, 5 of the top 10 most cited papers in the field annually are his including both of the top 2. 

Their executive team is highly qualified from initial investigation(in depth DD being worked on). The big advantage here is they have all the right players to be highly successful, but are currently trading at a $40mil ish mkt cap.

1264,THC," Guys... Psychedelics have been discussed since the sixties and many people advocated for their medical use ever since. Sure, there might be some benefit for certain syndromes or diseases but to believe that psychedelics will become a new giant legit medical market in the near future ist just naive. Mostly for two reasons: Psychedelics have massive misuse potential. That means their benefit has to be overwhelming to be used as a drug (like in opioids, which are just the only available drug class in their indication) or they will just not get approved for security reasons. Psychoactive drugs, even if they are not psychedelic drugs already have a giant black market, even if their trip-potential is not that great and their adverse effects can be ugly. So the hurdle to getting a psychedelic drug fda/ema approved is just incredibly big. I mean look at cannabis. All the years of advocating for THC and its medical uses and it still got only approved for some fringe indications. Therefore it will be regulated so tightly that it will never become a giant market.
And the second reason is: Just as cannabis, it will maybe instead slowly become available as a recreational drug. And as soon as that happens, it will become even harder to get it approved as a drug. Which is because of the way the pharmaceutical industry and the nutrient scam industry works. The companies working on psychedelics (if they are crazy) might try to go for an approval as a medicinal drug. With all the shitload of money that they have to put into trials etc. At some point they will realize that it costs so much, that they will likely never make the revenue to cover for these costs because psychedelics, even if they get approved, have a bad rep and will just not be prescribed as often. Also because of the regulatory hurdles that must be expected. Then they will decide to get it as a supplement on the market (just like all that cannabis stuff) and that will be the end of the road.

That said, psychedelic might be still a recreational market worth investing in but don't expect any real medical use of  psychedelics in the next 10 years.",Fischmesser,-1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lo1imb/psychedelics_huge_value_for_an_emerging_and/go43d77/,0.098,0.848,0.054,-0.9663

Really the market makers in flesh are not the problem.

The problem are the computers. They find news faster, they execute trades in a nano second, they hunt for limit orders and drive the price down to steal your shares.

What does Palantir do? Takes that unstructured data and organizes it so it can be relevant, searchable and actionable for the employees.

Does that sound like any other company that organizes the world's information so it's usable?

PLTR is for business intelligence what Google was for the internet. Sure, the internet was usable before Google. Sure, you could find things. But after PageRank, things just fundamentally changed.

But the best part about PLTR is that while they are a company that absolutely relies on data... they own none of it. So they'll never face the issues with privacy that Google and other Web 2.0 companies faced.

1399,CEO,"  Palantir Technologies Inc. has amassed a long list of shareholders in the nearly two decades since it was founded. On Thursday, almost all of them got the option to sell as much of their stock as they’d like for the first time.

However, most of the insiders said that they are planning to hold the stock, source:

1400,PLTR,"  Palantir Technologies Inc. has amassed a long list of shareholders in the nearly two decades since it was founded. On Thursday, almost all of them got the option to sell as much of their stock as they’d like for the first time.

1433,AMC," At 38, absolutely. I don’t see any issues with DFV going in there; he always said from the beginning he thought it was a ten bagger from $5, and getting more at $38 after cashing out millions in house money seems totally appropriate and safe.  I think he knows as well as you and me it’s not going to $420 anytime soon again (kinda like AMC hitting $26 by the end of January - not in this lifetime!) But as an investment that could make you 30%, give or take some, over a year I can absolutely agree with.  Yes, you look at who’s going in, and if DFV is buying at $38 you can take that as a vote of confidence from someone very knowledgeable with the fundamentals of the stock.

People often treat HFT like a boogie man, but the reality is 99.9% of retail players buy/sell so infrequently their activity truly isn't noticed on an individual basis

But, when you click 'sell' at whatever price you desire at any moment and get filled for a 5 share lot, typically that's an off the exchange transaction being filled by a HFT MM

There is a legitimate purpose for HFT in markets. FTT will be another layer of tax oriented to your 401ks, pension funds, and community endowments (university, foundations, charities) as they're more active in markets than most individual / retail investors.

A 'speed bump' like IEX has implemented is something that is more desirable than an arbitrary tax which will be bore by investment participants in a larger proportion than the select few entities it's allegedly intended to disenfranchise.",ze_end_ist_neigh,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lo706j/what_would_that_01_financial_transaction_tax_mean/go5oq0s/,0.014,0.837,0.149,0.9713

1482,SLM," Calm Down, Charlie.  This is bullshit and you're speaking out your pee hole.

POSITIONS OR BAN!!  Seriously, what are your positions?  Take a stake.  Don't just post bovine excrement.  I'm only addressing SLM and NAVI.  No clue why you have JPM and GS on this.  Again this DD is already dreck.

To your points:

1. What's your point about 1.6T in student loans?  Yeah, it's a large number.  So what?
2. I have no clue what point you're trying to make here.  WTF is 128 billion in private debt coming from?  WTF is your point about their (who's) market cap?  These companies are essentially a loan servicing entity for the Department of Education.  Not sure why you think there's substantial risk here.
3. You brushed against the analogy between mortgages and student loans, but failed to make the link.  Unlike home loans, these liabilities (or assets to the lenders) may not be discharged by bankruptcy, except in rare circumstances.  So what if these people take out the loans.    (3b.)  You obviously have not looked at the filings to see how the tranches were updated during Q2-2020 to address the expected changes in inflow of due to the national forbearance.
4. So what if the SLABs were underwritten by those banks.  They underwrite a majority of these types of offerings.  What's your point?
5. Biden's already said the 50k relief ain't happening.  $10k may be there, but even then that amount will be paid to the servicers.  Unless you can identify the impact of that $10k on every tranch within the SLABs, any speculation about the impact is a SWAG.
6. What kind of fucking point is this?  Why is no one talking about it?  Because it's a big fat nothing burger.  NAVI has channeled between $10-$14 for years, and has served only as a yield machine to pay off a monthly payment of mine once a quarter.

I would happily sell you LEAPs on this. Preferably covered calls, so I'll get that sweet sweet 6% yield or whatever (closer to 9% at my cost basis).

1542,AMC," Hollywood Ticket Revenue drives the initial bump in profits to filmmakers.  A portion of the ticket sales goes to the theater owner, the rest goes to the film producer.

Theaters make their $$$ on the Popcorn/Candy during opening weekend, at this time the studio is raking in about 60% of the take, as the weeks progress they take less and the theater takes more.

The blockbuster weekend can set the price expectation when the show syndicates on the steaming services. The amount of money paid back to producers in searchable on the internet.

Merchandising is the key to revenue, this is kind of theater neutral, but streaming exposure with well placed ads could be the part of the new model.

I believe when Lucas sold his rights to SW he kept the rights to the merchandising of the original characters
