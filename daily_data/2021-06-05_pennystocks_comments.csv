This is becoming a game of mind and time by now, however, Iâ€™m a Believer/Man of Faith!

All our DD since 12/2020 can not be all wrong;

ATOS managed to have 3 direct offering within 3/4 months, which is unheard of;

ATOS halted a critical P2 of Endoxifen for Breast Cancer about a year earlier, which is also very exceptional;

ATOS asked for extra 325 Mil AS (vs existing 123 Mil) which showed how good they felt about P2 Data of Endoxifen, and this was also kind confirmed by the way Dr. Quay talked about ""having a nice P2 package to talk to big Pharm ..."" in the Presentation at the Investor Summit Conference on 05/18/2021;

All the smart money behind 06/21 and 07/16 calls and the 10 HFs (each invested $5 Mil for off PPS at $2.88 in late 03/2021) are controlled by some very smart and greedy pro in investment, I would not believe that they could be fooled by anyone!

On 05/19, all 6 ATOS employees exercised all their available options at $2.90, Dr Quay - 1.90 Mil SH, Kyle - 0.85 Mil SH, others - 50,000 SH;

The fact that Dr Quay brought back Dr Chen (10% owner of ATOS in 2009) recently as a Dir of ATOS is definitely a good sign too. They might even be married by now. A smart scientist like Dr Quay would never bring someone that important to him into a embarrassment in case P2 of Endoxifen is not good!

Also, since ATOS is not going to present the P2 Data at ASCO this year (06/04 - 06/08, the only reason could be under quiet period for a BO/Partnership), this led me to believe that the probability of a BO/Partnership is 95%+.",AllSeeingEye7,3,/r/pennystocks/comments/nslk5y/atos_included_in_russell_3000_full_list_in_post/h0olgj3/,0.047,0.83,0.123,0.9681

63,ATOS," For ATOS (from Yahoo, credits to RuLaiFu)

This is becoming a game of mind and time by now, however, Iâ€™m a Believer/Man of Faith!

All our DD since 12/2020 can not be all wrong;

ATOS managed to have 3 direct offering within 3/4 months, which is unheard of;

ATOS halted a critical P2 of Endoxifen for Breast Cancer about a year earlier, which is also very exceptional;

ATOS asked for extra 325 Mil AS (vs existing 123 Mil) which showed how good they felt about P2 Data of Endoxifen, and this was also kind confirmed by the way Dr. Quay talked about ""having a nice P2 package to talk to big Pharm ..."" in the Presentation at the Investor Summit Conference on 05/18/2021;

All the smart money behind 06/21 and 07/16 calls and the 10 HFs (each invested $5 Mil for off PPS at $2.88 in late 03/2021) are controlled by some very smart and greedy pro in investment, I would not believe that they could be fooled by anyone!

On 05/19, all 6 ATOS employees exercised all their available options at $2.90, Dr Quay - 1.90 Mil SH, Kyle - 0.85 Mil SH, others - 50,000 SH;

The fact that Dr Quay brought back Dr Chen (10% owner of ATOS in 2009) recently as a Dir of ATOS is definitely a good sign too. They might even be married by now. A smart scientist like Dr Quay would never bring someone that important to him into a embarrassment in case P2 of Endoxifen is not good!

Also, since ATOS is not going to present the P2 Data at ASCO this year (06/04 - 06/08, the only reason could be under quiet period for a BO/Partnership), this led me to believe that the probability of a BO/Partnership is 95%+.",AllSeeingEye7,7,/r/pennystocks/comments/nsmk95/the_loungedaily_plays_june_05_2021/h0oktd6/,0.047,0.83,0.123,0.9681

72,CE," Check out the swedish company Chordate Medical whoâ€™s strategy is to perform an Exit of their treatment for chronic migrane and rhinitis, the treatment has already gotten a CE mark based on interim data since the treatment works perfectly with no side effects. The exit value as of right now is estimated to 120 million dollars if the company succeds to reach only 0,25% of the botox market for treating migranes. 0,25% is a super low estimate and since the treatment works great with no side effects they will probably reach several percent of the whole market. Many triggers in the nearest future and listening to the CEO of Chordate, exit is very near. Exit value of 30-50 swedish kronor is very possible and probably in the lowest range of what the exit will be worth. When the exit happens the shareholders will still keep their shares in Chordate and get the value of the exit in dividend.",Potential-Mango-518,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/nsmk95/the_loungedaily_plays_june_05_2021/h0p2ehn/,0.051,0.803,0.145,0.9393
