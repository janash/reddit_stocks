California is artificially crushing demand, not supply.  This is a recipe for the price of bacon and pork bellies  to decrease, not increase.

This doesn't signal anything. ""Going Public"" usually entails creating a plan to gradually convert your non-liquid assets (stocks), over whatever your perceived time at the public company is going to be.

It'd be really weird for insiders to make no sales at all after a lockup period. Even if you think the stock is going to go up, you don't want to create the perception of insider trading, so you build out a really boring stock sale plan that just sells a certain percentage of your stock on a regular schedule.

The only thing that really stands out is the CMO completely liquidating post-IPO. Could be a sign that she's planning to leave the company *soon*. Nothing suspicious about that though.

It goes to $50/share, you have $50,000 or 86% exposure.

197,GM," Thank you. I looked into them after your comment. 

Looking into it, the problem is with their agreement to partnerships without substance. In the [Q1 2021](https://nikolamotor.com/press_releases/nikola-corporation-reports-first-quarter-2021-results-121) it shows that they have entered into 4 agreements. But they are at the end of the day just agreements. With the GM ordeal, we know that agreement means squat.

If the FED turns off the tap imagine what life would be like across the world if there wasn't covid protections put in place. US government cheques, wages subsidies in Europe etc etc.  You'll be looking at crashes everywhere. 
Raw materials and commodities will be priced as low as they have been in the medium term, house prices will decrease by about 60 per cent what they are at the moment (open to debate on this point: I just feel US property is SO inflated at the moment), deflation will kick in.

359,SQ," >stratospheric p/e of over 1,000 in 2020...

You're using trailing p/e to value a company with revenues growing more than 50% per year? What is this? Value investing for retards?

All growth companies look ""stratospheric"" by trailing p/e, because investors are buying future performance, not past or present. These companies deliver slim-to-zero earnings today because they reinvest their cash flows so they can deliver exponentially greater earnings tomorrow.

394,SAVA," I don't think that article had much to do with SAVA drop. You're giving them a bit too much credit.

Market fluctuations, overall market fears and profit taking was the cause. SAVA was guaranteed to go up from a couple months ago. The rise up to 110 earlier last month already reflected that results were going to be positive. This biotech has now entered the ""buy the rumor, sell the news stage"" instead of the whole ""positive data causes xxx% gain"". That's how great the data is.

I'm also a scientist so I can see where they are coming from... A bit too harsh though, I agree. One thing about all clinical trial data reporting one needs to consider is that there are alot of different ""objective"" variables to measure or can be measured. Which ones you choose to measure and present is ""subjective"". Not measuring some of those variables can send 'warning signs', even to me.

For me personally... the data was good but I was hoping for better. BUT that's mainly due to hype and unrealistic expectations that I had. Bought in 55, avgd down at 38, sold 130. Anyhow, I expect this to drop a bit more as volume drops but will rise up again to 120s prior to November 12 months. Looking to re-establish a position.

Over the past week, I‚Äôve been rolling these to Dec 2022 $8 calls. The team that has come on board this company is too impressive to be ignored, and I‚Äôm making a large bet that they can streamline their costs (via logistics and new status as a payment processor). I also anticipate that they‚Äôll reduce their costs to acquire new customers by making inroads with Gen Z via ‚Äúinfluencers‚Äù. In the nearer term, I anticipate a significant beat on the upcoming Aug 12 earnings.

As we approach $14 (which I expect to see before end of August), I‚Äôll start to use diagonal spreads to write 5 delta calls 2 weeks to expiry. Collecting this principle on deep OTM calls should help me get a fair amount of my money back before having to liquidate.

The other potential outcome is that the stock continues to dump and eventually delists, but it‚Äôs hard to imagine the new executive would come on and select payment in stock options if the books were as bad as they seem to be priced for.

There are emerging markets world wide such as in China and India that the old automakers never penetrated successfully, and where Tesla is expected to do very well. China is going to be almost entirely EV by 2030.

Even a bear case will give Tsla 50-70 EPS by 2030 on the automobile sales and energy alone (not taking into consideration FSD and Robotaxi, which is a bigger question mark).

Opening up their charging network to other automobiles has the potential of another $5-10 EPS (based on Goldman's analysis of the revenue and margin of that).

Using a P/E of 9-10 like other megacap companies, which is what you should use instead of antiquated auto companies, and you have a share price over 1200.

715,FSD," So tesla was looking at $200 a month for their FSD subscription. To hit a $1 trillion/year revenue, they would need 416.7 Million yearly subscriptions at $2400/year. That would according to your world car total of 1.42 billion cars be about 29.4% of the cars on the planet.

Thats a pretty massive undertaking. I don't really see how they could capture that large of the entire global market. Unless it was truly very advanced and impressive FSD, I just don't see it. And that's assuming that $200 a month is the price that they settle upon, as well as assuming people would actually pay it for the entire year. I would guess most people probably would only use it as they desire for months where they are expecting to travel quite a lot.

**SpotGamma Daily Note for: 08/02/2021 AM**

*""Futures have popped back near last weeks highs of 4415.  As noted last week we held 440SPY/4400SPX as the ‚ÄúCall Wall‚Äù top, and the market was unable to push through that level. The Call Wall has now jumped to the 4500 strike, which ‚Äúvalidates‚Äù the market trading over 4400.""*

*""With that we see 4400 as major support for today, with resistance at 4445. There is a very large Combo bar at 4417 which may serve as a ‚Äúpivot‚Äù. Our models forecast a tight trading range, with a max move of 37pts. This is emphasized by today‚Äôs vanna model, which shows building resistance into 4450 due to dealers have increased long delta exposure (and offsetting with short futures).""*

Chart 1:  https://imgur.com/gallery/Sk4Yt5b

*""The gamma flip lines have now slid up under 4400, which we regard as a healthy signal. We like to see the entire ‚Äúrange‚Äù of key SG levels move high in unison as it suggests a healthy structure to markets. By this we mean that traders are adding calls at slightly higher prices, and put hedges are filling in beneath.""*
