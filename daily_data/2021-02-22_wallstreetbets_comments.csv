edit: i’d like to add that watching DFV mostly hold as GME dropped from $500 to $50 was the real-life equivalent of watching the joker burn his half of the mob’s money. of course, it’s a little different, because the market is zero-sum and no value was lost, but it’s the same energy. everything burns.",hiplobonoxa,27,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lpdvdf/deepfuckingvalue_position_update_gme/goc01p4/,0.078,0.835,0.087,0.0498

The clause states that members of both Houses of [Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress)

This doesn't protect them from perjury which is a felony. "" In the United States, for example, the general *perjury* statute under federal law classifies *perjury* as a *felony* and provides for a prison sentence of up to five years ...""

What the insurrectionists in Congress did was also a felony. My dear mother has said time and time again; ""If we throw some of the bastards in jail for their offenses, others will begin to understand that they are not above the law."" I am in full agreement with her on this.

I also think that just as we have a disclosure policy on TV for **real** news networks having to disclose their connections to topics they cover (including their guests).

Looking through the testimonies I'm not sure what else RH could have done (not lying would be a good start) besides have more money.

129,GME," I don’t think it’s just a matter of “liquidity issues”. Brokers would’ve been on the hook for any and all deliveries to their customers that exceeded the capital of short sellers covering on the other side of trade. I’m not sure what their insurance coverage looks like, but brokers would’ve been responsible for HUGE sums of money if this truly became an infinite squeeze and chose screwing some of their customers instead of going under and potentially liquidating all their customer’s assets.

In theory, if a broker only had GME holders and 0 short sellers they still would be responsible for delivering shares to their GME holders that couldn’t be covered by short sellers using another broker. They essentially have full liability for the actions of short sellers that they may have no direct control over. This creates an agency problem where the brokers allowing the naked shorting aren’t responsible for the fallout of infinite losses that get pushed to the broker with all the shareholders.

Edit: I don’t fully understand the liability between multiple brokers, clearing houses, retail traders and hedge funds, though it seems possible that those making the risky (potentially illegal) decisions aren’t always the ones taking responsibility for it. Either we need to have those making risky trades take full responsibility for them and eliminate/greatly mitigate the ability to create ultra risky situations (I.e. naked and excessive shorting).",DevinCauley-Towns,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lpnpn2/a_few_good_apes_this_is_how_the_congressional/god98f1/,0.094,0.779,0.127,0.8635

147,GME," 2030AD. The short ladders attack are still shorting GME, until no more shares are available, this creates a huge short float of synthetic shares. This causes and endless feedback loop and the price sky rockets. The now long dead APES finally cause the promised short squeeze. See, they still held. Yes, throughout all these years, through falling bombs and looting cannibals, through thick unbreathable air and cyanide treated water - they still held. Most not by choice. Society's collapse got them by surprise. When the nuclear winter ended their human hands had crystalized into actual real diamonds, for fate loves irony...

Deep in the bowels of the dead desolate earth, a tiny LCD screen covered in radioactive dust, suddenly lights up. It barely manages to cast some light but the message is still clear.

It reads ""GME $69,420,000,000,000.000"" (adjusted for usd inflation) and then it goes silent. Forever. Check mate Melvin.

153,FAST," Depends how fast it is and how it plays out.

If it happens slow enough that bond rates climb, there's some magical Maginot line where the risk/reward profile of stocks vs bonds shifts, and stocks will dump first. It'll probably turn out to be a mistake to sell/buying opportunity. Then if inflation gets away from bond yields, you'll see the prices of bonds dump and a wild swing the other way. 

As I understand it:

When inflation runs hot, bond prices drop to compensate. When it's running lower than expected, prices rise.

If we look back to Volker's era, inflation ran very hot and the top performers were gold and silver. 

.

If it's FAST, you'll wake up one morning, look at xe.com and see that the USD has plunged. There would have to be a catalyst for that. Either the President/Fed say something absolutely mind blowingly shocking like ""$5tn stimulus bill signed, direct payment of <5tn/300m? to go to every American's bank account tomorrow."", Or conceivably, but an edge case, some major deal like ""China signs 20 year deal with OPEC to pay for oil in <currency>"" (Yuan, Euros, Gold, SDRs, Batcoin, whatever.)

.

What companies do well in an inflationary environment? 

* Ones with a fuckload of debt that gets devalued. Imagine owing 100bn in a 20% inflation environment for 3 years. You start out owing 100bn, but in 3 years, 100bn is just over *half* the purchasing power. 

* Exporters who can charge global prices and bank devalued dollars.

Who gets fucked?

* Companies with great balance sheets. Same story as above. 100bn is worth about half what it was. eg last I checked Apple had ~100bn in cash. That'd be worth ~50bn to spend.

* Importers who have to pay global prices with the money in their bank.

.

Of course, the Fed and the rest of the CBs have been trying to stimulate inflation for over a decade. Japan... close to 3 decades. So far, despite a few panic attacks it hasn't happened.

158,USA," Dalio has also been quoted saying that ""we are going to kill each other"" as in go to war, either international or civil. He has been making the comparison between 2008-Now and 1929-1945 and the similarities are... apparent. A period of economic expansion following a major deflationary crisis, a period of rising nationalism and populism, and a major country undergoing massive hyperinflation. Now the comparison is not 1:1 considering the USA didn't have hyperinflation, but the USA was not printing like Germany did back then or we are doing now. The conditions in Germany back then were strikingly similar to what we see now, and Burry chronicles it in his Twitter thread. 

Now, don't kill me for that breakdown guys, I just want to let people know what he said and the comparisons he's drawn. 

Stonks only go up, and if all this happens, stonks will go up (see Germany, and Venezuela). The question is whether stonks will outpace the devaluing in currency.

165,GDP," He is dumb because you can't compare a country that lost a major war and was forced to pay huge fines it couldn't afford. It printed all that money hoping they would secure resources from winning the war, instead they lost.

The US has the largest GDP in the world. Yes we have been borrowing over our yearly GDP past few years. No different than a person buying a house that is 4-5x your yearly salary and then paying it off later. 

The fed is buying time until covid is mostly subdue and GDP picks up again. What the fed failed to realize is that they are creating hysteria with bubble talks which is causing people to be cautious which is the opposite of what the fed wants. The more positive covid news they can gather and see/show growing employment, the more the bubble pop will subside.

Then the fed will try to slowly raise interest rates in a growing economy which will cause a stock market pull back.

But true, he's making money almost no matter what since he bought most his shares last year, so it's not that big of an issue for him. But there's no world where GME ever gets to >$300 ever again. Until last month it never even hit $100 in it's entire existence.

if i understand it correctly : if nobody sells EVER  and also buys then the price will rise infinitely because the shorts cant cover. but of course everyone has their limits.. seeing the gains..

in theory though - correct me if iam wrong :

i get wet thinking of humanity united as one - not  selling a single share -  then make one big account and let dfv sell his shares and cash out. that money then will sit there and generate interest and we we just have invented infinity money (just make sure it has enough zeros :D )  and made it meaningless. noice. time for change. its about time.

285,GME," Just a recap of today so far. 100,000 shorts were covered in pre market which drove the price up by 13%. They were then immediately loaned out again shortly after open which lowered the price back to $43. Now it's back up to $45. The move to $45 was all retail. Whichever hedge fund tried flipping those 100,000 shorts is currently losing money AND retail traders now own that stock. Retail is gaining control over more and more of the float. 75% of them are losing interest and paper handing as soon as they realize we aren't going hyperbolic yet, but the 25% of 💎🖐 who intend to hold are gaining ground. The more we own, the more we control the price we're willing to sell it for. We have gained a ton of ground today even if it doesn't look like it on the price. We'd gain ground a lot faster if people quit lying and saying ""it's about to moon! Here we go!"" 

We don't know how long it'll be before it moons. The longer it takes the higher it'll go, as long as we maintain upward pressure, and buy hedge fund shares at a discount when they're lent into the market. 💎🖐 You need to understand this and help all the 🧻🖐 retards FUDing about understand it too. 

Watch this chart like a hawk. When borrowed shares are sold, Buy them. That's how we win.

370,GME," my personal analysis on why I'm STILL bullish on GME:  

1. contrary to the media narrative, it's not a """"frenzied retail investor rebellion"".... its actually hedge fund vs hedge fund now. Blackrock and Vanguard are heavily bullish on GME and have purchased a bazillion shares each. Oh and Roaring Kitty doubled down from 50k to 100k shares just the other day. He predicted GME a year before everyone else, he's an intelligent individual, he must have good reason for his decision.  

2. the hedge funds which are bearish on GME has kept their shorts open... either directly in GME or through ETFs which are highly weighted with GME. 

3. the hedge funds which has kept their shorts open are losing alot of money each day simply due to the interest rate alone. 

4. A number of catalyst events may kick off another rally. 

5. If the stock does rally, hedge funds may be greedy enough to open another short at the top, creating a game theory scenario where the cycle of rallying and shorting happens again and again, leading to the potential for huge profits. 

6. The price is so low now at \~$40 that the risk-profit ratio is heavily tilted towards profit. eg. If you put in $100, yes you risk losing it all, but if GME explodes and say 10x, you'll profit $1000. Sounds like a fun and worthwhile gamble to me. 

7. GME beat the market last friday & volume has been so low recently indicating the majority are currently holding. 

8. Even if the short-squeeze-rally doesn't happen, there has been change of management to capitalise on this recent publicity. Ryan Cohen is urging the board to pivot GME from a brick-motar company to an E-commerce platform. They've already hired an ex-Amazon vet as the chief technology officer. Even if the squeeze doesn't happen, GME might happen to be a good long term hold anyways. I want to give this company a chance. I remember in recent times how the whole world was screaming TSLA would fail... 

9. The political and historical context of GME is unprecedented. For the first time, we're seeing the influx of ""Kamikaze"" investors into GME. The type that doesn't care if they lose their profits. They want to make a statement against the financial system & how the HFs profited in 2008 to the detriment of millions of honest folk such as pensioners losing their retirement funds.",boogie-time123,39,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lpl1je/gme_megathread_for_monday_february_22nd_2021/godc4sa/,0.063,0.812,0.125,0.9693

During covid I've really missed going out to movies with my friends and I imagine a lot of people are feeling the same. Once people get vaccinated I wouldn't be surprised to see a pretty big surge in theatre attendance even beyond pre covid levels. Some of this is probably priced in but we really don't know when the regulations are going to end nor when everyone will be vaccinated so I think there's a lot that's not priced in yet.

It's usually in the form of:

CEO needs to own minimum 5x of their annual salary in stock

COO needs to own miinimum 3x of their annual salary in stock

559,IP," Meanwhile, I have seen people complain about getting a free game with no DRM on PC. The problem? DRM free means they need to own the game's install file instead of adding it to steam.

 The gaming industry is drooling over the digital distribution channels that lock consumers into their purchases. Even with last gen MS tried to lock people to their games with their crazy ""license locks to the console and needs to be validated shit.""

 Ya, Sony took a popshot and made that commercial about sharing games by handing them over, but both companies are pushing against physical game ownership, and it seems that there is a large part of the gaming community that can't seem to spread their assholes open fast enough.

 There is a huge chance that 5g will entirely kill physical game delivery, right now slow internet and dark areas are keeping it on life support, but every company is pushing digital hard, and it is dumb for them not to: they can pocket more profit at retail price, they can discount to the wholesale and break even from physical, and no matter what price digital sells at there is a smaller logistics cost and it completely takes out the resale market.

 Physical gaming is dying, and I am saying this as someone who avoids digital at every opportunity and hates to see it die. I hated to see the arcades die out 25 years back, and I hate to see physical go now. 

 Digital does ensure the games will stick around long term as long as they can avoid licensing music that causes the game to be pulled in a few years. Since all systems essentially come down to underpowered gaming PCs, it does seem like it also causes stagnation in new IP, See Nintendo for an example of stagnation of IP.

In response to the naysayer:

> ""Unlike your car being stolen, stocks are still owned by you and still have value. That value can go up and down. If you sell when it is down instead of when it is up, then that is on you.""

Likewise, if you buy when it is up instead of buying when it is down then that's also on you. Timing and knowing some sort of reasoning behind stock pricing and valuation is important. For those who bought at $400, it was a very risk time to buy GME, accept it. Yes the markets were manipulated, they claim due to government regulation, which I think is an excuse. I believe they conspired to stop the buying of shares of stocks that were viewed as at-risk to their own interests and portfolios. But that has to be proven in court and who knows if it will even be an accusation or charge brought up in court.

648,EV," Your talk is all nice, but when you pick an individual stock (e.g. Tesla) you risk being completely wrong. The market can be in a bubble, without Tesla and its excessive PE ratio being overvalued. The EV stocks can be a bubble if you argue the sum of the value of them exceeds the value based on the total addressable market for them, but that tells you nothing about any specific individual company. For the record, I disagree with Michael Burry's valuation of Tesla. He is comparing it to traditional automakers and I think EV's (especially if you factor in self-driving) is something else. Imagine suggesting (now) valuing the smartphone market like the flip phone market. The way I look at Tesla is it might fall with the market but if you hold ten years when its profits will be outstanding you will be amply rewarded (fyi, Apple, well it was before their smartphone days, traded at $1 a share during the dotcom boom and later went as low as $0.25 a share and is currently at $130 per share with a 35X PE ratio... so even if you suggest Apple should be valued at half or less, still way, way up).

Bottom line, if you are concerned about the market being overvalued, consider value investing.

&#x200B;

1. Massive Retail Investment Worlwide?  People have been quarantined for a year with nothing to do but save or invest, now vaccines are coming out with lowering hospitalization rates.  This is hardly a bad thing.
2. SPACS are overpriced?  This is true but $15 billion isn't even a drop in the market in the terms of total world wealth.  Even if all the SPACS available in the market blew up the only people would who would get hurt would be the investors.  There's no bond market for SPAC shares.
3. Options exploding?  This is true.  I'm not smart enough to know why but I think it has a lot to do with Wall Street trying to use quant magic in the derivative market to flip 0's into 1's to make fractional pennies from each trade.  To me this means the stock market  has become a derivative of the options market, in other words Wall Street has (literally) been buying their own bullshit for so long they don't know what anything is worth.  In my opinion we are in a value investor's wet dream scenario currently.  Just look at DFV.
4. Greater Fool Logic?  This is a comment about society, not fundamental market research.
5. Buffet Indicator Through the Roof?  This assumes that GDP is the correct measure for value.  Do you think GDP expresses true value given negative externalities such as carbon produced are not factored on corporate balance sheets?  This formula is boomer tech and will not apply in the century we are entering right now.
6. Valuations divorced from reality?  This is true.  It's a great opportunity for bears and bulls alike, just don't be a pig or you'll get slaughtered.  My hunch is that trillions of dollars of CAPEX projects from the world's largest companies (many of which are oil companies) will be written off when clean energy takes off.  When this happens the bond market is going tits up.  If there's a bubble, in my opinion, it's in the bond market tied to industries from the last century that innovation this century will disrupt.
7. Fed manipulation?  Hardly manipulation when you compare what they wrote down on their balance sheet to total world wealth to get us through COVID.  We weren't the only ones in the world doing this so it's not like we fell behind in an economic race where everyone got told to stay home until this crisis ended.  Every country was using weird monetary policies to get us through the pandemic.  In our case, the inflation created was a few drops in the bucket at most but nothing to be alarmed about.  Luckily we have vaccines coming out and decreasing hospitalization rates.  The Fed did its job and will continue to do its job when we enter economic recovery where it can begin paying down its self-created debt/asset on its magical balance sheet so the market will be like it was pre-covid and it will be like they never did anything. The fact that they raised 10-year US govt bond interest rates to near 2% from 0% recently says it all.

653,IT," Look, you are RIGHT! Absolutely, 100% right about us being in a monster, stupid bubble.

Thing is, we know we are in a bubble, and we KNOW the federal reserve will do whatever it takes to keep it going. Say it with me, WHATEVER IT TAKES TO KEEP STOCKS GOING UP! 

Remember when the yield curve inverted, and we had a mini meltdown in 2018 (or was it 2019, lockdown has messed with my sense of time). Like full bore supporting the banks.

The federal reserve and the US government will not allow the US equity market to correct. 

It took a fucking pandemic to have a correction in the longest bull market in history. 

There should have been one in 2013, and again in 2018/2019. But they wouldn't let it happen.

While we can debate the why (socialism for billionaires, underfunded pension plans, mistaken belief that higher prices = more economic activity = higher monetary velocity). 

The fact is they will not let the market drop. Full stop. 

Whatever it takes, no matter the cost. 

And look, I am a perma bear. 

When that bullshit speculative play (computer mining, cause you can't say it here) is worth almost as much as all gold in private possession, backed by completely nothing?

If that computer mining Ponzi scheme is worth a trillion dollars, why the hell can't GME be worth a trillion dollars? 


And yes, options are 100% driving market action. It is bizarre to see shares trade between the option bands (look at FUTU trading from plateau to plateau). And yes, they are going to cause serious problems at some point in the future.

660,TDA," I agree the point on SPACs. They are just absurd. 

I don’t see how retail interest is somehow a bearish indicator. If anything, an entire generation is taught that you are a fool to put your money in safe things. Like just graduate from college, start your job and put your extra cash in the stock market. If it goes down, don’t sell. Keeping it in a savings account feels stupid. When savings accounts interest rates were like 3-5%, that was actually masking how stupid it was not to put it into stocks.

Anyone can google the SPY chart and zoom out to see the obvious. Even if you bought at the absolute top of the chart in 2008, you are still in the green a decade later. 

Way back when TDA had $4 stock trade fees, it was sort of intimidating. Robinhood did democratize stock trades. Free stock trading + ease of use means everyone’s money is going into SPY.

669,GDP," On the Buffet indicator, GDP is growing much more slowly than the stock market for two reasons. 

First is increasing consolidation across pretty much every industry. The large, generally publicly traded firms are eating up small businesses, and so the stock market is becoming a larger portion of the economy. In the short term, that means that the stock market still has runway. 

Second, we have globalization. Many multinational corporations are based in the US but sell products world wide. Brain drain and lack of institutions mean many countries can't come up with their own large companies to produce things like water filtration, and so will buy products from an established Western firm, let's say Ecolab.",bcuap10,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lpdni5/the_greatest_market_bubble_of_all_time_a_full/goc8qey/,0.024,0.92,0.056,0.4118

672,AR," I agree and I prefer my AR to my Benelli m4. Though I do love my Benelli. 

This is how I structure my portfolio.

 

I would then assign a certain percentage of profit to each different category.

1. Trading
2. Cash
3. Long Term hold
4. interest rate/dividend products

If you do it this way you are always moving forward with acquiring more assets while maintaining an allocation for trading. You get exposure to compounding effect as well as short term opportunistic gains. You then use your opportunistic gains to acquire more long term things.

I have always though of my portfolio as a picture: You have foreground, mid ground and background.

Foreground is trading, mid ground is growth and swing type trades, background is your market ETFs and dividend type stuff. Cash is their so when you have a major crash, you can snap up good deals in the market. In the pandemic crash you could have acquired quite a few nice things, like solid companies that were yielding 15% dividends or other companies that have very solid fundamentals that are trading at discounts to their real price.

722,SA," # Roblox Shares to Begin Trading March 10

Sarah E. Needleman  
After delaying plans to go public, videogame company Roblox Corp. now  says it will hold a direct listing of its shares on March 10, a move  that comes at a time of heightened demand for at-home entertainment and  online social experiences.

San Mateo, Calif.-based Roblox originally planned an initial  public offering last year but held off after company officials decided  that the strong trading debuts of                       [Airbnb](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/ABNB) Inc.         and                       [DoorDash](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/DASH) Inc.         made it too difficult to determine the right price for its shares.

In January, Roblox [announced a change of course](https://www.wsj.com/articles/roblox-plans-to-go-public-through-direct-listing-11609978483?mod=article_inline),  saying it had opted for a direct listing. It also said it had raised  more than a half-billion dollars at a valuation of $29.5 billion for the  company, a sevenfold increase from a funding round less than a year  earlier.

However, Roblox’s listing plans hit another snag earlier this  month when the Securities and Exchange Commission requested changes to  how it accounted for the sale of virtual currency called Robux. The  company said those issues have since been addressed.

Roblox, founded in 2004, makes a free online platform with tens  of millions of games. The company’s user base soared through the  pandemic as stay-at-home orders meant more people spending time online.  It counted nearly 33 million daily active users last year, up from about  18 million the year prior.

One of Roblox’s defining features is that it outsources game  development to its players. Those players, mainly teens and preteens, in  turn produce their own hits and earn a majority cut of the revenue  their works generate.

Roblox is among a small number of companies such as Spotify Technology SA and                       [Slack Technologies](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/WORK) Inc.         that have pursued direct listings to enter public markets. [Direct listings allow](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-ipo-shortcut-a-direct-listing-11560976972?mod=article_inline)  companies to save a large chunk of money paid to investment banks in a  traditional IPO, but they don’t raise any cash in the process. Roblox’s  shares will trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol RBLX.

With the listing Roblox is slated to become the latest  videogame company to make its market debut within the past few months.  Others include game-hardware maker                       [Corsair Gaming](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/CRSR) Inc.,         game-software tool provider Unity Software Inc. and mobile-game developer Playtika Holding Corp.

Roblox on Monday also disclosed its fourth-quarter and  full-year earnings. The company said revenue grew 82% last year to  $923.9 million, while bookings more than doubled to about $1.9 billion.

Still, Roblox isn’t profitable and said it posted a net loss of  $253.3 million in 2020, up from $71 million in 2019, due to increased  expenses in connection with its information-technology infrastructure,  safety, sales and marketing and research and development.

**Corrections & Amplifications**   
Roblox said its bookings more than doubled in 2020 to about $1.9  billion. An earlier version of this article incorrectly said net  bookings, a metric that excludes deferrals, rose to this amount.

Cover 100k existing short positions

Open 100k new shorts at new higher price
Manipulate price back down, new shorts are now profitable

I suppose they could do this over and over, grinding out small profits with each turnover of positions, but it seems like bailing water out of the Titanic when they have tens of millions of shorts to cover. Not to mention this doesn't help the SI number or FTDs, and I'm guessing most of the shares that anyone is buying at this point have come from shorts borrowing. So what's the end game here?

821,RH," So let me ask you this though...  are you planning on making unrealized loss realized by selling before it hits above your basis?

If so, by all means, discontinue.

However, if you just factor your premiums into your cost basis, over time it will bring it down (if you’re using RH, I don’t think it shows this)

Take your cost basis x amount of shares then subtract your premiums from it...  then divide the new number by amount of shares held and you have your new cost basis.

Just saying, if you’re planning on holding until like 2025, why not make the extra return?  By then, you can scale down your strike price with what you are at for your cost basis and see an increase in premiums there too.  It may take 5-7 months but what else are you going to do?  Look at the dips and cringe still?

1159,IRS,"  Here ya go cheesedick:

If the IRS determines that your transaction was a wash sale, what happens?

You can't use the loss on the sale to offset gains or reduce taxable income. But, your loss is added to the cost basis of the new investment. The holding period of the investment you sold is also added to the holding period of the new investment. In the long run, there may be an upside to a higher cost basis—you may be able to realize a bigger loss when you sell your new investment or, if it goes up and you sell, you may owe less on the gain. The longer holding period may help you qualify for the long-term capital gains tax rate rather than the higher short-term rate.

That can be the silver lining—but in the short term you won't be able to use the loss to offset a realized gain or reduce your taxable income. Getting a letter from the IRS saying a loss is disallowed is never good so it's best to err on the side of caution. If you're concerned about a buying a potential replacement investment, consider **waiting until 30 days** have passed since the sale date. Or work with a financial professional who should be able to confidently navigate the ins and outs of taxes and your investments.

Edit: since you're not even from here lemme tell you about Frank so you know just how much these people give to their dogs. Frank (rest in peace old man) was an elderly black lab that animal control brought in. They found him in the woods, near starvation, with a bad respiratory infection, bad arthritis in his back legs, a pink baseball sized tumor for a hat, and completely blind and mostly deaf. APA took him in, gave him what musta been thousands in medical treatment and fostered him out for recovery. He lived with his first foster for 6 weeks dealing with the tumor removal recovery and got to have a dog sister who he liked to follow around and two cat siblings. When that family couldn't take care of him anymore I took him in. He got to enjoy living in a small first floor condo lots of soft places, carpets to help him navigate, and plenty of good smells and shnacks from the kitchen, and the occasional foster brother or sister coming in and out. We went for multiple short walks a day where he got to snoof all the neighbors and make friends with their dogs. He was a happy dude. His tail had some of the arthritis so he would wag it slowly but he still wagged it every morning and mealtime. In my care APA provided all of his meds for his chronic aches and ailments, his special prescription diet food for his bad kidneys, and an additional double enucleation (eye removal) surgery so he didn't have to live with two painful non functioning eyes. After 8 months with him and me convinced he was a fospice he finally found a forever home that could handle all his medical needs and expenses and wound up living out the rest of his days in the care of two very loving humans.

1222,AMC," ER doesn't matter, in the sense that any past earnings are irrelevant. AMC is all about forward looking.

The only things that matter in the coming ER call are:
1. What is their forward looking forecast - if the exec team is even moderately upbeat the stock will start going up
2. What else is in the works in terms of partnerships, promotions, better ways to utilize capacity, you know, just any kind of innovation they better be working at, because bums on seats may be OK for a slow lift off, but any mention of deals or new ways to exploit their assets are gonna be a green sign to growth.

1224,IMO, They'll crush on earnings compared to their lowest earnings of 2020. That's all that matters.

The 777 has one of the best safety records of any airliner in use today,  one of the best off all time in terms of its production numbers, and is  commonly lauded for its incredible reputation.

The 737 is one of the most highly produced passenger planes ever, so forget even saying ""at this moment"". Even with the ***TWO***  very unfortunate crashes of the MAX (which also holds blame on the  airlines for not properly training their 737 pilots coming from the  legacy 737s built over 40 years ago and then assuming this new version  would be the same, despite the glass cockpit and lack of steam gauges),  the 737 has a remarkable track record for reliability and safety. Only a  genuine moron would actually think to equate the two on any level. But  by all means, please feel free to skip all flights you're on which are  flown with a Boeing. Not only will you not be able to get anywhere, but  there's one less asshole to deal with at the airport and on the plane.

Here's what I replied to someone else who said something similar to you. \^  


If you ***really*** know what you're doing, taking on highly volatile speculative risk like this can be extremely beneficial (for example Michael Burry's housing market short). But very few people truly understand the mechanics of the market to that degree, and even fewer perform balls-deep due-diligence, so most overestimate their own confidence in their knowledge/abilities.   


Burry read through thousands upon thousands of mortgage bonds. The movie didn't do him justice in that regard. He spent literal weeks reading through those documents, looking at each individual loan. Then he made his decision to enter into that massive short position once he knew that the math was on his side.   


Most of us don't go that deep. So most of us shouldn't adopt diamond balls that big. Understanding your own risk appetite is a good first step though.",that_bermudian,4,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lpp05w/thoughts_on_the_recent_crash_hysteria/gocpo51/,0.141,0.769,0.09,-0.8927

1397,UK," Definitely don't listen to any government agencies or central banks figures,

If the truth got out it would be an instant crash we have 800,000 extra unemployed a week in the US now for almost 1 year,

Around 41 million unemployed total, their figures, the US has 331 million so around 12 to 14% of the population,

But that is the whole population, you need to know the amount of people able to work, not kids or old people,

These unemployment numbers have been like this for at least a year, their figures, so either they are limiting people from signing on or they are lying, they would never tell the truth assume they will only tell you what makes them look good,

So how bad is it if those are the good numbers,

All retail shops shut for 1 year, 60% of them never coming back, industrial warehousing empty, not to be needed for a very long time, if ever again, most people work from home so no need for a central place of work anymore,

Most jobs will not be returning at all businesses will restructure to do more with less, they are already doing it,

Someone owns all these empty businesses, and a mortgage is outstanding on all of it,

Home mortgages are not being paid, for at least a year, no forced evictions, until at least December,

So at some point banks can't survive on zero income, yes the print new currency by typing zeros in a computer, but if no one want loans and mortgages they aren't created new debt how does the banking system survive ?,

And why are the banks not saying anything ?,

I also want to know why the CDC is now the biggest homeowner in the US ?,

When it goes, it will go fast, if you thought a $30 Trillion dump of assets to cash last March was big try $300 Trillion dump,

The central banks keep telling us they can fix / catch it, they didn't last March,

When there is panic and everyone is all in they will dump it all and run for the exit in everything,

Gold, Silver, Stocks, Bonds, Cypto, all to cash and as the banks only have 3% of physical paper money on hand of all accounts balances then the banks will all fail,

The answer hold 6 months to 1 years in cash now, just in case, somewhere where you can get to it, not in a bank,

If the whole system goes down, card transactions, internet access, limits on physical paper money, definitely limited opening hours of banks and limiting withdrawal amounts per person, they did this in 2008, they did this in March in the UK by severely limiting bank opening hours, so huge queues would build up with one teller,

At about 9% all of the nations taxes will go to servicing our debt.  Our nation is caught in a debt trap. It must print and inflate and hope that that tax receipts in a few years allow it to manage the debt. Inflation is the only way out for the US.

If the currency devalues, the value of stocks will go up when measured in that devalued currency. This is good for options traders. Stonks go up real fast, your fiat looses value real fast, you end up with stonks for cheap. What else are you going to do?

1404,ABC," I have been hearing this same inflation-is-coming argument since literally the tech crash of 1999-2000.  There has been no inflation.  Inflation is a solved problem; the Fed has solved it.

Even if there were to be significant inflation, it would be good for stocks.  If a share of ABC corporation has a certain value on Monday - say one share is worth $350 - and then on Tuesday the purchasing power of dollars is cut in half by inflation, that share is now worth $700.  Your pitch is not about inflation, it is about economic stagnation, and there is no reason to foresee that right now with a massive stimulus coming, a year and a half of pent up consumer demand, and a consumer populace who are driven to work by their economic circumstances.",sockalicious,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lpg9z8/burrys_tweets_deciphered_for_retards/goctxlf/,0.109,0.728,0.163,0.7096

1534,GME," 1. Do you have many examples of that happening? Generally shareholders would simply sell the shares, not look to liquidate. There's a bunch of Bankruptcy arbitrage firms that will play games like that, but usually only if there's some strategic resource or something to plunder. 

2. I know, that's my point, they've got nothing that has strong liquidation value.

3. It would stop from issuing stock, that is true, but they haven't pursued any mechanism to do that. GME is on the verge of bankruptcy because their business model is losing money, shorting the stock isn't going to make that more or less true. 

4. Right, so then...you know the mechanism of why the situation you're talking about with liquidation isn't something that really happens much. If you know low value companies buy themselves back already then what are you talking about?

5. GME is shit because GME is shit. Someone shorting the stock more isn't going to do much, they're going to go bankrupt one way or another. People shorting it can push a price down, but they can't make the company go bankrupt. When it goes bankrupt it'll be because it's a shitty business model.

\- The peripheral gaming market is too competitive. Corsair offers no significant technical advantage over Razer, Logitech, or even the pure white labelled Rosewill components (Newegg's inhouse). Arguably, their ergonomics pale in comparison to Logitech's flagship mice (LOGI 510), and their keyboards are minor players in the mechanical keyboard world (think Ducky, Das). 

That being said, I genuinely like the design and aesthetics of Corsair desktop components. I built my miniITX build desktop using the Corsair Carbide 250 and their H100i cooler. But they're not Apple, they aren't going to lead the industry by design standards when you have literal retards here buying glowing lights because ""oohhhh pretty"".

1749,CRSR," CRSR is definitely a high quality participant in video gaming and eSport growth with strong brand position and diverse product line and those are Goldman Sachs words.
But there are some concerns in regards to Corsair not meeting it’s demands and losing revenue. They recently reported supply constraints in almost every product category in 4th quarter. Semiconductor lead time has increased from 10-20 weeks to 40-50 weeks.

1751,ATH," I love how all of the $CRSR talk lately has been met with \*extreme\* skepticism - especially on this sub. Like, are you fucking kidding me guys? 

The company has good fundamentals and is clearly in a position where they are interested in expansion and gobbling up some market share. The company has been around for decades and only recently decided to IPO - there's a reason for that. 

I think their exposure to the streaming market is an underestimated facet of their business model; their Elgato brand is solid & last week's announcement of the VBI acquisition is huge in terms of potential re-occuring revenue. This is going to give them an advantage over their competitors in the years to come. 

The technicals speak for themselves, the stock has been consolidating for months now between $34 and a high of $48, consistently setting higher lows along the way. The dump-off after the earnings report two weeks ago coupled with the broader market selloff we have seen has provided a great opportunity to enter a position under $40 off the heels of the company's strongest ER to date. 

Anyone who has had their eye on this stock should be pleased with the level that it is at right now - it's gonna breakout to ATH any day now.",gentlemaninthecap,4,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lpp29b/corsair_gaming_inc_crsr/godjlt3/,0.025,0.814,0.161,0.9828
