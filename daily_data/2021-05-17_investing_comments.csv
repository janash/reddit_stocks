This was because the dictator Augusto Pinochet's & company constitution, reforms and laws. Don't get me wrong , he was a dictator and a relatively brutal one, Im not going to defend him in that way.

But inequality!!! They scream here, what they refuse to acknowledge is the fact that people die from poverty not inequality, see Argentina, their poverty rate is stupidly high and more people die from hunger than covid.


The other side of the coin is that, yes Chiles land was sold to foreign investors and natural resources have been over exploited, the superrich do ilegal shit and get scott free, plenty of people (although not being ""poor"") have shitty lives surviving with the bare minimum, and inequality is very high (but I don't think the Gini coefficient is a good indicator).

56,DD," I haven't commented in a very long time, but this needs to be said. I used to work at a large defence contractor and while it wasn't Lockheed, it doesn't really matter because all the big ones operate exactly the same. 

They will always have business rolling in because they have offices in almost every Congressional district, so everyone in Congress has an incentive to make sure they have large and never-ending contracts for jobs in their districts. Cost over runs don't really matter and accountability doesn't either as long as you keep employing people. So investing in any defense contractor is like investing in the US government and is extremely safe. Honestly a DD like this is basically saying water is wet.

If all you are looking for is a safe Investment then this might be it, but the business model has no incentive to innovate because the money won't stop flowing in. The attitude of the company is to give the government exactly what they ask for and R&D should only happen if they are willing to pay extra. There is no competition from Boeing or Northrop because they are all guaranteed to get enough contracts to sustain themselves. Even if one of those companies starts to fall behind the government will save them with a contract tailor-made for them, because it's in the interest of national security.

It’s little known fact that defense spending in 2020 was around 12% of the total federal budget.  You could completely zero out the defense budget and barely make a dent in the deficit.  People still go with LBJ era 60’s talking points on defense spending because they don’t understand how the government spends its money, which is overwhelmingly lopsided toward mandatory items like welfare/Medicare/social security.

And the word “record profits” is a pointless phrase.  In an inflationary environment every company should be posting “record profits” every year.

This is not true - again an LBJ era talking point.  Mandatory social expenditures have exceeded taxes collected since approximately the late 90’s/early 2000’s.  If you lump all payroll taxes together they only covered about 25% of mandatory spending in 2020.

However if inflation rises much above what is expected and continues to stay high then I would expect the markets to have a strong reaction. As for what is priced in today, I think the market is pricing itself for a small risk of inflation having more sticking power, it seems so far the market is believing the FED for better or worse. I think what we’ve seen over the last 2 weeks as more inflation related data has come out is the market pricing the risk of sustained inflation, which doesn’t seem to be the current base case.

69,GME," I'm going to copy/paste an article Matt Levine wrote when the whole GME mess was in full bloom.  The TLDR is that ""hyping up a stock"" is not market manipulation, and never really has been.  Those fines you are alluding to were likely tied to false statements or something similar - basically just getting together and saying ""let's all buy this stock, so it goes up and we make money"" isn't really illegal. 

Here's the copy/paste:


If a lot of people on Reddit band together to drive the price of a stock higher, is that illegal? I have been asked that question a lot recently, and I want to be clear that:

1.	I don’t know, and

2.	If I did know, I wouldn’t tell you, because I do not give legal advice in this newsletter, and I particularly do not give legal advice that people on Reddit might read while pumping up stocks.



That said I suppose we should talk about the question in general and extremely not-legal-advice terms. I guess my answer would be that it might be illegal in all sorts of ways, but it is not obviously illegal, and if the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission were to go after WallStreetBets for this stuff they will be breaking new ground and going beyond their previous cases. I do not want to say “this stuff is all fine,” but I will say I am not all that bothered by it.

There are two main things that are illegal. One is “securities fraud.” This basically means lying about a stock. The other is “market manipulation.” Nobody knows what this means. Legally, it means something like:

>To effect, alone or with 1 or more other persons, a series of transactions in any security … creating actual or apparent active trading in such security, or raising or depressing the price of such security, for the purpose of inducing the purchase or sale of such security by others.

So if you buy stock with the purpose of pushing the price up so that other people will buy it, that’s market manipulation. If you buy stock hoping that the price will go up because other people buy it, that’s not market manipulation; that’s just normal. Those things are not so different. There is a “traditional four-part test for manipulation that has developed in case law”: 

>(1) That the accused had the ability to influence market prices; (2) that the accused specifically intended to create or effect a price or price trend that does not reflect legitimate forces of supply and demand; (3) that artificial prices existed; and (4) that the accused caused the artificial prices.


So consider the general concept of a “pump-and-dump” scheme. The most classic pump-and-dump goes like this:

  1) I buy some GameStop stock.


  2) I put out rumors—in my subscription newsletter, on Reddit, in fake press releases, whatever—about some catalyst for the stock to go up. “Hey I hear from an inside source that GameStop just got an exclusive contract to supply downloadable video games in Tesla cars,” etc.


  3) People see these rumors, believe them and buy GameStop stock, pushing the price up.


  4) I sell the stock to them at the higher prices.

This is very straightforwardly illegal and the SEC goes after this stuff all the time, alleging securities fraud. Lying about stocks. Here is the SEC’s “Investor Alert: Social Media and Investing -- Stock Rumors,” which pretty much defines a pump-and-dump this way:

>For example, in a “pump-and-dump” scheme, promoters “pump” up the stock price by spreading positive rumors that incite a buying frenzy and they quickly “dump” their own shares before the hype ends. Typically, after the promoters profit from their sales, the stock price drops and the remaining investors lose money.

There are variations. The SEC has gone after forms of dishonesty that aren’t quite lying about the stock. For instance, if you are a widely followed stock promoter with a subscription tip newsletter, and you email tips to your subscribers and then sell your stock to them while saying that you’re buying, that seems dishonest, and the SEC will go after you. Or if you are a promoter or research firm and you put out positive research about a company, but you don’t disclose that the company paid you to put out the research, that is also bad. 

Now, I think you could do a pump-and-dump without any actual lying. For instance:


1.	I email subscribers to my expensive private newsletter saying “hey let’s pump GameStop.”

2.	We all buy GameStop, knowing that we’re just doing it for the pump, with no real or fake catalyst for the stock to go up.

3.	It goes up, because we bought a lot of it. 

4.	Other people, innocents and high-frequency trading algorithms, see it go up on heavy volume and think “hey this is a good stock, we should buy it.” They buy it, pushing the price up.

5.	We sell the stock to them at the higher prices.


In this version, I have not lied about a stock. On the other hand, I have effected transactions in the stock to create trading activity and raise the price, for the purpose of inducing people to buy it. Seems like market manipulation, “painting the tape” or something. The SEC goes after stuff like this occasionally.

I think that in modern markets you could even do a bit better than that and have a completely honest pump-and-dump:

1.	I show up on Reddit and say “hey let’s pump GameStop.”

2.	We all buy GameStop, knowing that we’re just doing it for the pump, with no real or fake catalyst for the stock to go up.

3.	It goes up, because we bought a lot of it. 

4.	Other people see us doing this, read my Reddit post, know we are pumping the stock, and also buy it, because we seem to be having fun, and they like fun too.

5.	Eventually some of us get bored and start selling and the price collapses.",MasterCookSwag,20,/r/investing/comments/nebp01/what_will_happen_to_reddit_traders_pumping_stocks/gyfyild/,0.075,0.794,0.132,0.9955

Isn't that largely because the government very significantly incentivizes EVs? I was under the impression that they had much lower tax rates? If so, then I might argue that isn't necessarily a sign of market shift but rather a simple adaptation to government policy.",Not_FinancialAdvice,3,/r/investing/comments/neb5lg/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/gyg6s93/,0.057,0.921,0.022,-0.3274
104,TD," Hi, I'm 17 years old and live in Lithuania. I am currently not employed. I don't have a specific objective, I just want to save up for the future. I would like to start with low-risk investments and move to higher risk if I succeed. I only have a bit of crypto (around 70 eur) and some cash. I would probably like to start with up to 1000 eur. I don't have any debts. I'll probably choose Revolut as my platform since there aren't many available in my country and I'll use TD Ameritrade to look at graphs and more detailed information. I'm currently reading ""How to make money in stocks: a winning system in good times and bad, fourth edition"" and I hope to finish it before becoming 18 and starting investing. I'm not sure where to start. I tried trading crypto, but that was pure luck.

107,MSCI," **Three-fund portfolio in Europe, Czechia?**. Recently I decided to do something with my savings, my short-term saving will end and I will be able to invest a decent amount. I am looking for a long-term investment (talking about 20-30 years). I am 24 and I have just started making money.I narrowed the the wide pallet of options into two- roboadvisors and the mentioned lazy portfolio. Since the variety of roboadvisors over our continent is quite limited with high fees (+ some available only for certain countries), the best option I found for myself was with 1% p.a. fee, which I find ridiculously high. For this part, I'd like to know if I missed something and if there actually is a decent option for people living in my country.  


Regarding my no.1 option at the moment I have a few unanswered questions. The lazy portfolio consists of US, international stocks and bonds. I am having a really hard time choosing some parts of the portfolio, since until now I thought we are not able here to buy the ETFs tracking indexes of US stocks and bonds such as vanguard, spdr etc., but an alternative ETF that tracks same indexes (from major part). Now I set up a demo account at xtb broker and I actually am able to find some of the typical US ETFs with which I could potentially construct the portfolio. For example:  
VTI.US - Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund ETF  
BND.US - Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund ETF  
ISAC.UK - iShares MSCI ACWI UCITS ETF  


Now I must admit I am a bit confused about this. Where's the catch?  


And the third, last one question- wouldn't it be more profitable (not easier, that's without question) for a beginner to use the roboadvisor with high fees anyway than constructing and choosing one of these by themselves? I must admit that I've been digging into this for days, almost weeks now and the head keeps on spinning.",CuriousCrepe,1,/r/investing/comments/neb4xj/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gyh820a/,0.04,0.9,0.06,0.8602

111,IMO," Highly over valued IMO.  That said, it was over 4 years from Allen Greenspan's ""irrational exuberance"" speech to the dot-com bubble bursting.  But burst it did; with blood, divorces and ruined retirements in it wake.

It is always about risk, and risk is hard to measure.  But the real money in the long term is not made with great returns in the bull markets, it is made with not bleeding as badly in the bear markets.

But there is no historical precedent for these high market valuations and low interest rates.  The reddit hive mind seems to think that this is OK, but it scares the shit out of me.  Thus I keep my overall bond exposure to short duration.  

In the 1970's short term bonds seemed to be really stupid -- except in hindsight they were the smart path.   40% of my allocation is investment grade, short duration.  At the same time my advice to my 30ish aged kids is 100% broad based indexes.

115,IBM," Simple my guy
●Retail investors In 2020 have increased by a fuck ton compared to 1900
● Coca cola is a consumer product. People need drinks and they are dominant in that market. People have always needed the demand for drinks for 100 of years. If you notice most food and beverage  companies have been around for 100 years but it's not the same for tech. Many tech companies have fallen off after a few years of growth( IBM, Motorola and many other companies)
● If the demand for the products of a company simply reduces then the growth of thay company also reduces. This is a cycle we cannot measure and it is purely based off what the company  and its competitors can please its customers  for.
● I agree companies will have growth for 20 years too but it's not all companies. It's only a fraction of the companies that will have growth in the next 20 years and they will get exhausted too once the company has no new products to offer which will meet the demands of its customer.
