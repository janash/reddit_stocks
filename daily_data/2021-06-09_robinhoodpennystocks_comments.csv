37,SNDL," 82% return is, imo too good to turn away. Especially from a volatile stock like SNDL. That's a 10/15 $1 call, correct? Theta is pretty low so you won't lose too much until about 21 days to expiration, when gamma can start ramping hard and the option becomes more susceptible to volatility.

Could it go higher and you miss gains? Sure. It could also tank and you'd wish you sold. I think of it this way - I could hold the option and think/hope it goes up. Or I could take my gains and redeploy the profit into my next play.",Itsboomhomie,5,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/nw1ikw/thoughts_on_penny_long_calls_do_you_guys_hdol/h16ieej/,0.045,0.721,0.234,0.966

21 days isn't a hard and fast rule, it's more a strategy from tastytrade, who focus mainly on options trading and farming premium from theta strategies. Their strategy is enter at \~45 DTE and exit \~21 DTE.  The curve is extra pronounced for OTM options strategies, but again, they focus mainly on theta strategies, which I've found are difficult to apply to pennies. Exiting at 21 DTE is how they manage risk from gamma.

u/Belvador is correct about penny option volatility. There's not much math for the greeks in regard to theta - it's the amount of value per share the option loses PER DAY the closer you get to expiration. An option is for 100 shares, so just move the decimal point over two places.",Itsboomhomie,2,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/nw1ikw/thoughts_on_penny_long_calls_do_you_guys_hdol/h16xyh1/,0.063,0.867,0.07,-0.0005
