I saw your post about the stimulus payments. I just wanted to let you know that I had the exact same issue. My first stimulus payment took forever to arrive by mail and then the second one for $600 never arrived. I checked to get my payment info on February 28th regarding the second payment and it actually said that they were sending me a check on July 6th. just struck me as very odd because it was nearly 6 to 7 months after the stimulus was issued.

Now that the third payment has been created when I check the get my payment info on the IRS website it says the same thing regarding not enough information. It also states that all of the first and second payments were issued already and that if you did not receive one you have to file for a rebate on this year's taxes. I guess the July 6th date was a fib?

You may worry about selling when the squoze finally squeezles, but this ""violation"" is literally just a warning, you're not charged a fee nor will they ever disable the sell button.. it acts as a demerit on your account and you can find a counter in your settings that shows how many GFVs in your account history.

222,DD," In case you hadn't figured it out, let me reveal the hedge funds plan to you:

Their goal is to sew enough fear, uncertainty, and doubt among the lot of you that you give up on GME ever squeezing, write the whole thing off as a conspiracy or LARP like Q-anon, and shift your focus away from the stock completely. Once something like 95% of you have done this, they will finally let off the pressure and let the squeeze happen on their own terms. They believe they have such vast unfathomable wealth that they can delay the squeeze indefinitely until this becomes a reality by shorting over and over again, moving their positions. They are so confident in this that they borrowed another $60B in bonds to shore up their defenses.

You are going to question if the squeeze will ever happen as DD after DD doesn't come to fruition because they are able to actively suppress them time and time again.

Everyday that paper hands sell out to realize 5% here or 10% there, they are making it that much easier for the hedge funds to realize their end goal. The hedge funds are hedging on the idea that you can't keep your attention on GME long enough to realize the squeeze.

There is literally only one path to victory for us. **BUY AND HOLD**. You may have to hold for a month. You may have to hold for a year. You may have to hold even longer.

Eventually, the hedge funds investors will come knocking, asking to see some realized gains, and the hedge funds will be unable to deliver because right now all they have are projected gains that will only be realized if everything unfolds according to their plans.

*Don't let things unfold according to their plans.* How? **Buy and hold.**

Ignore the price. Set your sell limits, or a notification to inform you when its a price you are interested in selling if your broker won't let you set a decent limit. And go about your life. When you have more funds available, buy more GME. That's it.

1. Do nothing. **Risks**: you don't actually have GME shares, and who knows if Vlad will let you cash in the IOUs you do have before RH folds and he goes off to jail. **Advantages**: you get to be lazy and also not worry about shares getting stuck in limbo during a squeeze.

2. Transfer all of your GME shares out of Robinhood to a real brokerage. **Risks**: transfers could take 1-2 weeks to complete especially if you bought within the last couple of days, so you'd be out of luck if the squeeze happens and then fizzles while they're in transit, and you also lose $75 to Robinhood. **Advantages**: you don't have to worry about Robinhood losing your shares, refusing to let you sell them, or whatever else Vlad is planning to do to screw over RH users, and some transfers reportedly go very fast (couple of days). Also as someone points out below, if many users transfer out of RH in coming days/weeks, it could prolong the squeeze, and it also forces RH to transfer *actual shares* meaning they have to buy GME if they really don't have your shares.

3. Transfer *some* of your GME shares. Same risks/advantages as above, but now you're hedging by keeping something in RH for now just in case. Additional downside is that you'd have to pay another $75 to get the rest out later if you decide to do that, and if you do half now and half later, you're more likely to have some shares in limbo during a squeeze.

4. Leave your existing shares in RH, but buy more with a better brokerage. **Risks**: same as 2 for everything you leave in RH, higher cost basis. **Advantages**: considerably less risk with your new shares, plus you have more GME!

5. Sell your RH shares and try to buy them with another brokerage. **Risks**: impossible to time market, so you will probably incur a loss.

# IMPORTANT NOTE TO ALL THOSE CONSIDERING SELLING TO BUY BACK AT CHEAPER PRICE. !!!

..

This is exactly what the HF's wants you to do. They want you to paper hand so they can ride this thing to the ground. If you keep holding you will bleed the hedge funds dry and they will continue to grow their hole so fucking deep that the moon is to short for the rocket ride.

Secondly, if you decide to sell and you miss the rocket you'll get fucking depressed. You could lose out on millions. Is it worth saving a couple of thousands bucks to miss the chance of being financially secured for the rest of your life? Give that some thought.

The last thing you need to understand is that a big share of this community has holding this stock from 40 to 450 to 40 to 350 to 200. It takes time to adjust to the dips, and it might be scary, but the upside of holding is so big. Selling will only delay the inevitable squeeze

They can buy your real shares and sell you back some of their naked shorts, prolonging the amount of time they have to deliver real shares, easing the pressure on them.

They need all the real shares they can get so they love it when day traders hand them out on a plate.""

ROBINHOOD DOES NOT SELL YOU SHARES...THEY SELL YOU IOU‚Äôs

They wait for the price to drop & make their profit off the spread

They also delay your orders, send the order info to the big Hedgefunds, who then use their algorithms to determine which way the market will move based on the info & beat everyone to the punch

Citadel pays Robinhood for order flow, allowing Citadel to make moves before the rest of us.  So, if we all went balls deep on $CUNT, Citadel sees those orders first, and can buy, then sell them to us and make a few cents on each order.

358,GME," I might be blind, but I don‚Äôt see the dtcc or sec in this lineup. I want someone from the DTCC to talk about how they gave Robinhood timely notice to NOT have to meet capital requirements on the day Robinhood halted shares and didn‚Äôt tell anyone why until after market close.

Robbinhood was either too lazy or inadequate, or for some other reason, chose not to care. Take a look at the DTCC‚Äôs statement, which seems to directly conflict, ie like two trains colliding on a train track, with Vlad‚Äôs statements to congress about having to meet DTCC capital requirements. I might be missing something there but I don‚Äôt think so. The DTCC submitted their statement for the first hearing, and note the NSCC is under control of the DTCC:

‚ÄúNSCC examined the market activity and clearing member margin requirements to consider whether it would be appropriate to adjust or waive the capital premium charge, as permitted under the applicable rule. NSCC determined that the spike in market volatility, particularly in the so-called meme stocks, was a material contributor to elevated VaR charges for several clearing members, including most of those subject to capital premium charges. NSCC determined that it would be appropriate to waive the capital premium charge for all clearing members, using the discretion provided in the rule to reduce or waive this charge. (Footnote 4)Just after 9 a.m., prior to the market opening at 9:30 a.m., updated daily margin statements reflecting the waiver were released in NSCC‚Äôs portal and revised excess/deficiency notices were emailed to clearing members. All clearing members timely satisfied their clearing fund requirements.

4: Consistent with this conclusion, NSCC also decided to waive the capital premium charge for all clearing members through Monday, February 1, by when the unusual market activity from Wednesday and Thursday would have settled.‚Äù

https://www.dtcc.com/dtcc-connection/articles/2021/february/18/dtcc-statement-to-house-financial-services-cmte

At 9:56 am, around an hour after the DTCC sent notice of their waiver to robinhood, robinhood published this blog post, saying they were halting the memestocks ‚Äúdue to recent volatility.‚Äù

https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/1/28/keeping-customers-informed-through-market-volatility

I‚Äôm still wondering why it took a full market day for robinhood to come up with the ‚Äúneed to meet capital requirements‚Äù argument, after citing volatility in the morning and then citing liquidity issues that night to CNBC. 

The players in this hearing seem like a wash.. some professors and think tankers.. trading partner at a different hedgie, an nyse guy.. the nyse is barely relevant now as they don‚Äôt make much decisions beyond listing and unlisting stocks. Tomorrow‚Äôs hearing will probably be used to throw politics around hard about whether to regulate or deregulate. I hope they have the sec and especially the DTCC there for the third hearing.

About the DTCC‚Äôs waiver, It could be robinhood didn‚Äôt have enough time to react to it, or that robinhood didnt think that feb 1 was a long enough time if the GME volatility trend continued from Jan 28.. or it could be that the waiver only reduced the charges for not meeting the capital requirements and that charge was still too high for robinhood.. idk and I don‚Äôt think we will know, at least we won‚Äôt find out during tomorrow‚Äôs hearing. It could also be that robinhood has already answered this question and I missed that answer like I missed my crayons rolling off the table.

395,AMC," I have been thinking a lot on what DFV and Ryan Cohen (BTW, who edited his Wiki?) have been suggesting.  I live in a place with seven GameStop locations serving a population of about 500K.  I am not convinced they need many smaller locations, but fewer larger destination stores.  Think IKEA (but clearly not with the square footage).  Part of how they can diversify is by starting an esports league where you compete at your local GameStop to qualify for larger regional events.  These locations would need LAN center-esque facilities.  In addition to the video game events, they can expand to tabletop gaming, and general nerd retail, with a bit of social gathering.  I have seen a number of comic book coffee/beer bars pop up around town.  I think there is enough overlap in those demographics to make this a thing.  This is what I have been thinking about.  


Now, with your idea of AMC somehow getting involved, AMC real estate is going to already have a lot of the provisions that could make a solid GameStop like ticket booths, underperforming square footage, and concessions.  And they also have massive screens, projectors, and seating that could hold audiences.  Maybe they don't merge locations like what Yum! Brands does with their restaurant holdings, but there has got to be a synergistic opportunity here.",Drew707,4,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m6k3fb/338k_raised_alreadymonke_strong_together/gr6pkqu/,0.02,0.889,0.091,0.9424

490,TA," TA is basically BS. If you know anything about mathematics and you see how they do TA you would see how they base information off peaks... but the peaks are not meaningful! A peak happens because of a coincidence of buyers or sellers trading simultaneously which causes a data peak but in no way really effects the market(it could trigger movement due to the options side of things but then that would change the entire chart). So they base their analysis off peaks and if you change the peaks then it changes the analysis. You will even find them selectively choosing which peaks they use to suit their bias.

&#x200B;

"" Those are always waves that move the market and consist of five  sub-waves because five is the smallest number of waves that can  accomplish an overall movement. ""

Why five? Because it is the smallest number of waves that can accomplish an overall movement. Why? Because clearly five is the number that does that!

&#x200B;

Prove that these people are morons:

&#x200B;

Suppose they predict X is going to happen using their voodoo. Does that mean that a HF has to abide by their prediction and the cosmos will make sure a HF won't do the very opposite of what the prediction is?

TA is equivalent to numerology/astrology. It's just more bullshit to try to convince morons that there is a way to predict the future(there isn't except in the obvious correlative or factual shit that anyone can predict).

In fact, one day TA will become so advanced it will incorporate astrology and numerology. They already use the Fibonacci sequence as some indicator, which again, is complete BS. 

&#x200B;

The sheer number of TA books pretty much proves TA is BS. If TA worked at all it would make those that knew it a ton of money and they wouldn't have to write books. In fact, they could make as much money as they wanted. If you can win more than 0% of the time in the market then you can turn that in to any amount of money(with enough time) as you wanted.

&#x200B;

If those people who wrote the books really wanted to help you make money: They would just use their TA knowledge and make trillions and then give you that money. They sell books because TA doesn't work.

This goes for anything that someone is trying to sell you for you to make money. If they wanted you to make money and they themselves had a method that worked they would simply give you money, no need for all the games.

498,TA," It's worth learning the basics of TA just to have some idea. It's somewhat simple though: They look for common patterns in stock and then say they predict the future stock price. It should be extremely easy to verify. Just go find some stock then apply TA to it and see how often it predicts the future value of the stock(which you know since you went back in time).

&#x200B;

That is, suppose you have S(t), the stock price, go to S(t-100) and match the pattern to TA and see what it says up to say S(t-50). If it says the stock will go up look at S(t-25) and did the stock go up or down compared to, say, S(t-75). (of course it's more vague than this but just giving an idea.

What happens in this BS, like all such things is that when the predictions fail they are blamed on compounding factors rather than the failure of the theory itself. It's just another religion.

&#x200B;

E.g., How some Christian says ""Jesus is coming next week""... then Jesus doesn't show up... and rather than people(or the person saying it) saying they were wrong and their analysis/prediction was a failure and to learn from their mistake they double down and come up with some further BS to cover up the BS they stated. This is basically insanity. It's believing in BS that isn't real.

BUT this does not mean one can't use such info. If you know some guy thinks Jesus is coming next week you can ask him if he will give you all his money. He might if he really believes it(in fact, you can test his ""faith""(or insanity) using such a method).

&#x200B;

TA does measure some things int he market because 1. Many people use TA so they use those patterns to make decisions and that does modify the market(it is a self-fulfilling prophecy). 2. Certain patterns do occur and if one can recognize those from the noise one can use them. This is sorta like, say, playing black jack and a certain player having a ""tell"" or ""twitch"" or ""give away"" or whatever. The market also has such things as it is a sort of organism in and of itself. 

&#x200B;

I think if you don't take TA too serious and think of it more as general principles then it might be more useful. Every stock and every instant is different so you need to develop a sort of ""feel"" for the underlying patterns and couple that with everything else. It's really no different than anything else in life.",EternalDissonance,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m6okds/gme_is_just_getting_started/gra0xf3/,0.077,0.867,0.056,-0.9312

Con to RH: Literal market manipulation and the way they make money consists of selling your trade info to other funds and such and by tacking on extra cost to the share/option price. 

You can put in a limit buy for an options contract at 0.15 premium. All of a sudden the price will go to 0.16. Cancel the sale and the price goes back to 0.15. I tested this one multiple contracts multiple times. The same happens for selling. The price will go down slightly once you put the limit sell in at the current price.

725,GME," ***INTERPRETING DAILY FINRA SHORT SALE REPORTS***

I‚Äôve seen a lot of posts about FINRA daily short sale reports and what it means. Importantly it doesn‚Äôt mean what you think. This isn‚Äôt FUD it‚Äôs just how market making works.

TL;DR a lot of the short volume is market makers shorting to facilitate *buy* orders and they immediately cover with the next trade. 

-High short volume in the FINRA report actually often reflects net BUYING. This is why trying to interpret these reports is pretty much useless. 

-That sounds crazy but that‚Äôs how market making works. 
-FINRA report is only for off exchange trades (dark pools). It‚Äôs a myth that dark pools are all institutional, your retail broker is sending trades to dark pools like Citadel, Virtu, etc. 

-A MM makes money on the spread between buying and selling (obviously). 
What happens is - your order to buy 100 shares of GME at market gets sent to a dark pool. The MM (a computer) SHORTS you those shares at $108.793 and then BUYS those shares back at $108.791. A short of 100 shares is recorded. This also explains how you see ridiculous volumes and ridiculous # of shorts every day for a stock that has a 50M float. The MM isn‚Äôt ‚Äúgoing short‚Äù GME. They short it for a millisecond then buy a fraction of a penny lower a millisecond later.

-So high short volume in the FINRA report (which is ONLY reflecting off exchange trades (dark pools) does NOT necessarily reflect high levels of actual shorting. It often reflects high levels of buying! Um. Like we just saw this week. Repeat that It does also does NOT reflect exchange trades. 

Short volume is also reflective of HFT, algos, MM delta hedging etc. Bottom line is it can‚Äôt be used to infer changes in total short interest. 

You don‚Äôt have to believe me you can read this super interesting piece here. Generally speaking, the idea that large short volume in the report is good news for holders seems true! It‚Äôs just not for the reasons you think.

We came for the tendies, THEY made us a movement.

They couldn't stand to lose to what they viewed as an army of retards and expendables, so they broke the rules. They couldn't take the loss and they just assumed if they punched us in the face we would take that L and move on. They didn't expect it to galvanize this movement and expand it. They thought they could erode the resolve with relentless attacks and media lies but they were fighting against veterans of meme wars. 

Since these frat boys all love to read sun tzu and pretend they are great generals of finance and business I'll put it in those terms. You ALWAYS give the enemy an avenue of escape, because otherwise they'll be forced to fight tooth and nail for survival. The thing is there is a point at which is transcends and becomes something deeply rooted in a cause you just can't say no to. They did that to this movement, we didn't do it on our own.

They could have accepted the loss and we would have made our tendies and that would have been it, but it wasn't enough and now they stand to actually lose and they're running lower on tricks. This wasn't personal for me but now it is. They wanted to disparage us in the media but look at all the good this subreddit has done with the money made from GME.

758,SI," Problem is that criminal penalties for business mistakes are hard to push when it comes to this sort of stuff. What if, for example, a genuine mistake was made that led to underreporting of SI (e.g. the intern messed up, idk)? Does this mean the CEO goes to jail? If it does, that would incriminate honest mistakes (yeah I know, saying ""honest mistakes"" in the context of hedge funds feels weird to me too), which is wrong from any perspective. But if it doesn't mean the CEO goes to jail, well, there's your way out for the Hedge Funds: just let the intern do the reporting and no one goes to jail whatever you report. 

All of the above also only applies if the wrong reporting of SI is discovered, which means that you would have to check the books of the hedges, which would take a lot of time and effort, so it would only be done half-assed.

What I'm trying to say is they'll do whatever fuckery they can to still get away with it, and they would likely succeed.

I absolutely agree that this sort of business should be entangled, but I don't believe that forcing the correct reporting of SI's by incriminating individuals would change anything. Maybe shorting as a whole should be illegal (if you think about it, how is it legal to sell a stock that you don't own?), at least until stuff gets regulated.

1120,DD," U/Leaglese did a good amount of DD to summarize the DTCC ruling that came out earlier this month so I refer to his synopsis which holds the March 19, 2021 effective date.

NSCC / DTC GME rule change DD

Please note this is my first attempt at DD and it may be full of errors. Where I mess up, please let me know and I will amend as necessary.

Below I will attempt to make the content of the filing clear and understandable for a layperson and any assumptions you draw from it are your own. I am not a financial advisor nor is this intended to be financial advice. Do your own research before making any financial decisions.

With that out of the way, from what I understand the rule change this document provides is in relation to the handling of Supplemental Liquidity Deposits (""SLD"").

What is SLD? Well from what I can work out, it's the fourth part to a rule the NSCC has to ensure they can settle the securities of it's members should they default. 

This is a rule for all members and that list is very long and features the fan favourite, Citadel. It also includes those affiliated with it's members, charmingly dubbed 'families'. 

Put simply, it's the NSCC and friends' way of ensuring they can complete settlements on behalf of it's members should their member default on their obligation for a security. It's kind of a way of ensuring the member can't just scream bankruptcy and pass the book to them for free, like a bank deposit on a mortgage for a house, except it's on their trading portfolio.

It's important to note this is not the only way the NSCC ensures settlement of securities. They have four ways they manage liquidity risk, namely the NSCC will:

I. Put in a cash deposit to their settlement fund to ensure no default;

II. Use what are essentially, short term I.O.Us in their other paper program as an alternative for payment;

III. Draw credit from a line of banks; and

IV. Use SLD. 

All to ensure a trade settles. The SLD sum is usually equal to an estimate of what the NSCC couldn't cover using I.-III. above.

It's quite telling the beginning of this document sets out a comprehensive overview of liquidity risk management. Although it's relevant to the rule change, given the current context we find ourselves in, it's obviously possible this will be needed to protect them, or else why update the rule?

I digress - so what is the change? To understand the change it's best to know what the rules are currently. 

At present, those members and affiliated parties of the members (Melvin anyone?) who grossed the largest debits would be required to pay SLD. I mention Melvin as they lost billions, and are certainly on the 'watchlist' of the NSCC at this point, or at least via Citadel are on the hook given Citadel's investment.

The NSCC previously calculated the requirements for SLD from members no later than 5 days prior to the options expiry activity periods - i.e on the whole the third Friday of each month, somewhere between 15th and 21st day of each month or every Friday. The next nearest and biggest, as we all know, is the quadruple witching day on 19 March.

To do this, they would review the trades of it's members over 24 months, calculate the 30 or fewer member's whose trades presented the largest liquidity risk over this time, and make them pay SLD proportionate to their calculated risk by no later than 2 days prior to the expiry of the options - i.e. the 17th March in this case. 

Provided all goes well, the SLD sum would be returned 7 days later. If it doesn't, the SLD sum is used to ensure that member's obligation is fulfilled by the NSCC. They reserve the right to increase this sum at any point if that member's risky behaviour requires it and they can hold it for 90 days. Further, the member is also allowed to make a special deposit into the cash fund (i.e. rule I. above) if they expect their exposure to be greater than what the NSCC has determined (as if they would).

Instead, the NSCC now wants to calculate the requirements for SLD from members EVERY DAY and to make this calculation much simpler. Rather than attempting to guesstimate the sum they would require in excess of the NSCC's capital, based on 24 months history around only the options date, they will instead just take the sum of their risk each day, minus their available capital and what's left over the member has to pay as a deposit. Whilst it sounds simple, this could account for billions of dollars being unavailable to those members who say, I don't know, are billions in the hole on a short position.

This is made in direct response to an acknowledgement that their member's day trades can cause just as much fuckery to them as options expiring. Again, how many billions have been lost outside the options dates? I can't be bothered to look, but it's a lot.

The change therefore would put those same 30 or less members on the watchlist, except this time the NSCC would calculate their members (and thereafter the NSCC's) exposure to the risk of their trades on a daily basis.

The proposed change would also allow them to send the SLD back the next day, instead of holding it for 90 days, which may assist liquidity in the market. But we don't care about that.

As a theoretical example, the NSCC would be able to turn to someone like Melvin and say hey buddy, you're on the hook for what we calculate is a price spike up to $100 today whilst you're short at $4 x 500k shares. Please therefore pay us $96 x 500k as insurance, thx. Oh and you have to make this payment within 1 hour of notice too, but don't worry we'll notify you an hour before the market opens (this part is actually in the document).

If this exposure to liquidity was in the region of $2 billion for 2 or more members, the sum required would increase proportionate to the risk and could be sought collectively from those members who are determined to be fucked. This seems to be deliberate in that it definitely could leave those identified as fucked with literally no free cash for that day. Whilst it's never happened before, I wonder why they have decided to create a special provision for such a risk?

Further, if a member decides to retire the NSCC reserves the right to hold the demanded SLD of the day for 30 days. No easy outs here.

The above changes, provided there are no rebuttals, will be effective in 10 business days, or, you guessed it, the 19 March 2021.

AMENDMENT: credit to u/thilianii who spotted at page 58 this rule may come into effect as late as 60 days post expiration or even a further 60 days following that, should a request for further information raise novel or complex issues. This change may yet be a while off, but it relies on the SEC kicking up a stink. If they don't, this could happen before the quadruple witching date.

What this seems to me is the NSCC wants an immediate heads up in advance of a member shitting the bed and going bankrupt (or almost, hi Melvin); so they can take a fair slice of their money to protect themselves, rather than only finding out on a random Friday once a month.

The NSCC is essentially checking it's garden for dog shit every day instead of guessing when to based on a history of 24 months shitting. To continue the metaphor, the statistical amount of checks may be right most of the time, but doesn't account for diarrhea, does it?

But how does this affect GME? This change feels like a reaction. Hedges got caught with their pants down and the NSCC knows damn well it's next in line if they go bust and this change serves to protect them. The very fact this change has been proposed tells me some shit is about to go down and the NSCC doesn't want to give those responsible a way out without taking a chunk from them first.

The other impact is that 1 hour before open a member who has designs on short attacking the stock for that day whilst they eat their caviar may suddenly have a majority of their liquid funds stripped from them and held by the NSCC. Less money to play games with may tip the scales on the supply and demand, and could well provide a catalyst for a price surge.

Edit 1: Unfortunately because I lurk I don't have sufficient karma to comment so I'll put some responses here.

To the person who said Melvin can't have SLD drawn from it, check page 7 of the filing which states anyone associated with a member are considered an affiliate family and are therefore liable for potential SLD. This is very open for interpretation legally and I'd say a company investing $2bn in your company for a stake is affiliated. If I'm wrong I will change.

To the person who asked why 19 March, page 19 of the filing specifically states that without rebuttal it'll go ahead  in 10 Business Days which is legal jargon for 14 days not counting weekends. I'm interested you state 60 days for approval, US law is outside my jurisdiction - is there a minimum approval period of this amount? The document states the later of these two days so if this is in place I'll amend the post, please direct me.

Finally to the person asking who would make the objection, the filing is made to the SEC. As this is outside my expertise I'm unsure who could rebut the change but it's likely those who would be affected - i.e. the members such as Citadel Securities so this has a high chance of being delayed.

Edit 2: credit to u/Rellicus who sums my post up nicely and provides a TLDR as follows: 

 TLDR: Market is regulating itself because the big fish know the gov isn't going to be able to bail them out if GME goes light speed.

Shorter TLDR: Market is butt clenched

1121,GME," U/Leaglese did a good amount of DD to summarize the DTCC ruling that came out earlier this month so I refer to his synopsis which holds the March 19, 2021 effective date.

NSCC / DTC GME rule change DD

Please note this is my first attempt at DD and it may be full of errors. Where I mess up, please let me know and I will amend as necessary.

Below I will attempt to make the content of the filing clear and understandable for a layperson and any assumptions you draw from it are your own. I am not a financial advisor nor is this intended to be financial advice. Do your own research before making any financial decisions.

With that out of the way, from what I understand the rule change this document provides is in relation to the handling of Supplemental Liquidity Deposits (""SLD"").

What is SLD? Well from what I can work out, it's the fourth part to a rule the NSCC has to ensure they can settle the securities of it's members should they default. 

This is a rule for all members and that list is very long and features the fan favourite, Citadel. It also includes those affiliated with it's members, charmingly dubbed 'families'. 

Put simply, it's the NSCC and friends' way of ensuring they can complete settlements on behalf of it's members should their member default on their obligation for a security. It's kind of a way of ensuring the member can't just scream bankruptcy and pass the book to them for free, like a bank deposit on a mortgage for a house, except it's on their trading portfolio.

It's important to note this is not the only way the NSCC ensures settlement of securities. They have four ways they manage liquidity risk, namely the NSCC will:

I. Put in a cash deposit to their settlement fund to ensure no default;

II. Use what are essentially, short term I.O.Us in their other paper program as an alternative for payment;

III. Draw credit from a line of banks; and

IV. Use SLD. 

All to ensure a trade settles. The SLD sum is usually equal to an estimate of what the NSCC couldn't cover using I.-III. above.

It's quite telling the beginning of this document sets out a comprehensive overview of liquidity risk management. Although it's relevant to the rule change, given the current context we find ourselves in, it's obviously possible this will be needed to protect them, or else why update the rule?

I digress - so what is the change? To understand the change it's best to know what the rules are currently. 

At present, those members and affiliated parties of the members (Melvin anyone?) who grossed the largest debits would be required to pay SLD. I mention Melvin as they lost billions, and are certainly on the 'watchlist' of the NSCC at this point, or at least via Citadel are on the hook given Citadel's investment.

The NSCC previously calculated the requirements for SLD from members no later than 5 days prior to the options expiry activity periods - i.e on the whole the third Friday of each month, somewhere between 15th and 21st day of each month or every Friday. The next nearest and biggest, as we all know, is the quadruple witching day on 19 March.

To do this, they would review the trades of it's members over 24 months, calculate the 30 or fewer member's whose trades presented the largest liquidity risk over this time, and make them pay SLD proportionate to their calculated risk by no later than 2 days prior to the expiry of the options - i.e. the 17th March in this case. 

Provided all goes well, the SLD sum would be returned 7 days later. If it doesn't, the SLD sum is used to ensure that member's obligation is fulfilled by the NSCC. They reserve the right to increase this sum at any point if that member's risky behaviour requires it and they can hold it for 90 days. Further, the member is also allowed to make a special deposit into the cash fund (i.e. rule I. above) if they expect their exposure to be greater than what the NSCC has determined (as if they would).

Instead, the NSCC now wants to calculate the requirements for SLD from members EVERY DAY and to make this calculation much simpler. Rather than attempting to guesstimate the sum they would require in excess of the NSCC's capital, based on 24 months history around only the options date, they will instead just take the sum of their risk each day, minus their available capital and what's left over the member has to pay as a deposit. Whilst it sounds simple, this could account for billions of dollars being unavailable to those members who say, I don't know, are billions in the hole on a short position.

This is made in direct response to an acknowledgement that their member's day trades can cause just as much fuckery to them as options expiring. Again, how many billions have been lost outside the options dates? I can't be bothered to look, but it's a lot.

The change therefore would put those same 30 or less members on the watchlist, except this time the NSCC would calculate their members (and thereafter the NSCC's) exposure to the risk of their trades on a daily basis.

The proposed change would also allow them to send the SLD back the next day, instead of holding it for 90 days, which may assist liquidity in the market. But we don't care about that.

As a theoretical example, the NSCC would be able to turn to someone like Melvin and say hey buddy, you're on the hook for what we calculate is a price spike up to $100 today whilst you're short at $4 x 500k shares. Please therefore pay us $96 x 500k as insurance, thx. Oh and you have to make this payment within 1 hour of notice too, but don't worry we'll notify you an hour before the market opens (this part is actually in the document).

If this exposure to liquidity was in the region of $2 billion for 2 or more members, the sum required would increase proportionate to the risk and could be sought collectively from those members who are determined to be fucked. This seems to be deliberate in that it definitely could leave those identified as fucked with literally no free cash for that day. Whilst it's never happened before, I wonder why they have decided to create a special provision for such a risk?

Further, if a member decides to retire the NSCC reserves the right to hold the demanded SLD of the day for 30 days. No easy outs here.

The above changes, provided there are no rebuttals, will be effective in 10 business days, or, you guessed it, the 19 March 2021.

AMENDMENT: credit to u/thilianii who spotted at page 58 this rule may come into effect as late as 60 days post expiration or even a further 60 days following that, should a request for further information raise novel or complex issues. This change may yet be a while off, but it relies on the SEC kicking up a stink. If they don't, this could happen before the quadruple witching date.

What this seems to me is the NSCC wants an immediate heads up in advance of a member shitting the bed and going bankrupt (or almost, hi Melvin); so they can take a fair slice of their money to protect themselves, rather than only finding out on a random Friday once a month.

You're also saying that even though there may be more OI at a higher strike, the amount of money it would take to get there is unrealistic and therefore not worth the long's time?

What about these options that are going from ITM to OTM as the stock price lowers?

1141,OI," My thesis is based on the assumption that MMs hedge and de-hedge constantly. Just as they want to lock in shares they may have to deliver, they don't want to bleed money holding shares as the probability of needing to deliver drops. Their goal is to make $0 on their holdings, and profit from arbitrage on bid/ask spreads. Thus a zero risk model of profiting.

I think a gamma squeeze, unless sparked by a major catalyst that brings natural volume, must be done on expiration day. And it must be a large enough, quick enough increase in price that it can't be stopped once it starts.

Bringing the starting price for Friday down does all the things Ii said and you understood correctly. But it does depend on MMs following their zero risk model. If they're holding onto shares and bleeding money ""just in case"" then it throws a wrench in the plan. I don't understand MMs enough to say for sure whether or not there are circumstances that they voluntarily take on risk like that.

So lower starting price means less capital is needed to spark it, more OI available to suddenly flip to ITM, and by the time it reaches 200-250+, the momentum from forced buying could be at a point that is unstoppable.

Something I forgot to mention, and don't have full understanding of is the DTCC rules going into place. I'm unsure if this will lead to more aggressive margin calls on large short positions, which obviously sparks the actual short squeeze.",AJDillonsMiddleLeg,8,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m76vks/why_im_very_bullish_on_gme_this_week_strange/gr9yes7/,0.064,0.829,0.107,0.8215

1145,GME," Hedge funds can still borrow shares to short, for starters.

The price can be attacked by short players because nobody is buying either. There's hardly any natural volume on GME at this point, just players on both sides holding their ground.

Long whales can dump shares to lower the price. They'll likely do this slowly so that IV doesn't spike and option premiums stay lower.

Everything that's happening, in my opinion, seems to be long whales letting the price drop gradually. I expect that to continue through the end of day tomorrow; and then for them to unleash hell on Friday.

1164,GME," It's impossible for them to cover more than 100% of the shares. If they fabricated shares then they have to figure out how to unfabricate them.

There is no way to buy and sell shares to cover more than 100%.

The math is simple #buyers = #sellers.

&#x200B;

If buyers own more than 100% of the shares it means there are more buyers than there are real shares. So any buying and selling that is taking place under the fabricated amount is fraudulent.

&#x200B;

Now, if a shorter shorts a share and share isn't covered then that short is fabricated because there is no guarantee it can ever be bought back(which is what buyers are trying to make happen with GME. It supposedly only takes 50M people to buy 1 share to make that happen if everything were on the up and up).

The system relies on the fact that shorters who fabricate shares can unfabricate them by eventually buying the share(so it is like a delayed transaction that balances after some time). What happens though when buyers don't sell? If there are shorters and the buyers are not selling the shorters get royally screwed.

&#x200B;

The question is, are the buyers in GME going to hold and is there enough of them that will buy all the stock to allow the supply to shrink to near zero or will they sell out once they see the numbers go up?

&#x200B;

At some point the shorters will be able to buy the stock the buyers are selling and cover their position even if at a loss, but if the loss is not too great then they will survive and probably be able to recover because retail still won't understand how the stock market works. Hedge and mutual funds own most of GME so eventually they will sell to rake in the profits and shorters can always short no matter what the price is to drive it down and take profits.

Ultimately it requires everyone to buy GME and to hold for anything to work. The more people that hold the less supply the more demand. It's that simple. Basic mathematics that only a rigged system can break.

Hypothetically if no one sold the stock could go rise to any price but at some point people will sell, greed will take over. If they see that one stock is worth 50k and they have 100 and they say ""I'M A MULTI-MILLIONAIRE!!"" most people are going to sell, regardless if the stock could go to 150k or 500k if they and everyone else held. Distrust and greed becomes a larger and larger issue the higher the stock goes which limits what it can do.

This is why the first squeeze failed, it wasn't because of robinhood but because buyers sold because they got greedy and wanted to profit before other greedy buyers sold.

It's really that simple. What makes GME different is that there might be a lot of retail with just a few stock that don't really care about losing a few hundred and are willing to hold until the stock gets in the thousands. If they are convinced that it can go higher they might still hold and this then becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Unfortunately the larger investors will take advantage of that and rip off the retail investors,  unless the large investors realize the retail isn't going to sell and then then the large investors might hold too trying to maximize profits(specially if they bought in early).  If stock skyrockets and some sell but there are rich investors trying to jump in on the game then the rocket can continue to go up. Ultimately the bag holders are those who sell last. In a perfect world these would be the people who bought in at the least amount and would be helping the retail who bought in at higher amounts... then everyone shares in the wealth(it's distributed across more people). But greed doesn't let this happen.

&#x200B;

No one knows how GME will play out. If good news comes down the line from the company the price will increase, but ultimately it is tremendously overpriced and someone has to lose for someone to win.... but the entire market is this way(and why a crash will eventually happen that will be far worse than 1929 causing a collapse of the economy to a degree no one can imagine unless the bubble is slowly popped(unlikely because the government is clueless).",EternalDissonance,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m6r7wy/thank_you_citadel/gr7uiao/,0.104,0.817,0.079,-0.9793

They are only social to increase their powers, but most people will destroy other humans if they benefit... and in fact that is exactly what we see, specially in capitalists countries. E.g., MBA's fucking over health care to profit, basically murdering people but it is ok because they do it through gouging the sick and the sick just die from lack of care. Or how the elites buy off government to empower themselves then fuck over society with their insane schemes(e.g., wasting 100's of billions to colonize mars rather than use it to actually help people here on earth first such as eliminating poverty and increasing education which actually then makes going to the mars more likely).

The rich elites will not fix the problems of humanity, they will only make things worse. History proves this to be the case. The only way things will get better if basically 6B people get their fucking heads out of their asses and learn they are being manipulated to hate each other so the other 1B can benefit off it. I think this is slowly happening and GME is just a stepping stone. The problem is what will the elites do to retain their power? Some are willing to destroy humanity rather than become a commoner.

If everyone worked a little at things that mattered(yes, cleaning toilets matter, far more than reporting the news), farming(yes, eating matters more than being a pro athlete), etc then humanity would be balanced and far more prosperous.

First off, what a wonderful username! ;) Second, I am probably one of the most hated but misunderstood individuals in WSB land. My 6 Green Bar Method for GME, was just seen as a shil move or something to take away from the mission but that is furthest from the truth. I intended to help give Apes more bananas, but some apes got mad, and well, we had a banana throwing fight, and I took my green and red bananas elsewhere.

With that being said, I 'can' in factor predict a GME parabolic event and define how it reacts in real-time. I have precise ways through quantitative analysis and data extracted from GME since the rise above $400. Many have witnessed the call precision, and many have benefitted from it.

If data is what you're looking for, I have a place where it's all posted and free for all. It has all the charts and data to back it all up on how it works. I also have a discord if you're interested.

Will it be exactly Citadel that margin calls Melvin? Idk

The stock has been spiking due to huge hedge fund call purchases, retail buying, and illiquidity due to a large portion of the holders being passive funds, as well as some short covering (S3 estimates that another 4M shares were covered in last 2 weeks).

1485,GME," I do know that. I've made that disclaimer at the end of my posts since I started posting in this sub as well as the other sub where I acknowledge the limitations and weaknesses. Maybe I should call this something other than Technical Analysis and I'd be happy to change it. 

To save you the trouble, this all started as a thought experiment where I imagined what it would be like if a single actor was responsible for the short interest on all open option contracts. I know that this isn't realistic. An individual market maker on an options transaction immediately hedges in some way in any of a variety of delta-neutral strategies that I will not bore you with. I do that on my own in my other trading account and its a decent side gig to sell spreads and the like. 

But the one thing that has me like a dog with a bone with GMNE is that there is imbalance with GME on what I call ""the minimum exposure point"" which is basically the strike where ITM puts would be about the same as ITM calls.  

For most stocks this minimum exposure point is the next strike away from the closing price. When I've seen a deviation in other stocks in my career, this usually is immediately corrected and is an opportunity for profit. For GME, there is, and has been since I've been looking at this, a huge divergence here that, for some reason, never has been corrected. 

In my opinion, the fact that this hasn't been corrected indicates to me that someone on the short side of these options is going to get royally fucked at certain price points--most particularly $800. **Someone is uncovered.** What we don't know are the numbers. I'll give that. Just because my analysis shows 3.2 million shares coming due next Wednesday doesn't mean that all 3.2 million shares have to come from the market. But given the disparity in the minimum exposure point, you can't say that it's not an insignificant amount of shares.",Unlucky_Falcon1754,7,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m70mqw/3172021_gme_open_interest_report_at_yesterdays/gr8paup/,0.035,0.847,0.118,0.9776

1488,GME," That‚Äôs fine.

I guess the problem I am seeing is (across the sub) is there is no acknowledgement of incorrect analysis.

In fact I feel like it‚Äôs been quite the opposite, where people double down on flawed analysis. Many of the tools being used by folks here don‚Äôt stand up to scrutiny, not when utilizing said tools against other stocks, and tools that don‚Äôt even work for GME on a day to day or week to week basis.

1489,GME," For instance, in addition to buying puts, which have to be reported, you could take a bearish position by affirmatively selling naked calls. **You don't have to report short positions in naked calls.** We know that in the last disclosure that at the end of Q4 2020, several HFs (including Melvin) had long put positions in GME. It isn't a stretch to imagine that they **also** have short call positions that they could have used to help subsidize their long put positions.

Indeed, a trader can recreate the returns of a short sale by selling a call and buying a put for the same expiration and same strike price. This won't be recorded as a ""short position"" to FINRA. At best, the only thing that gets reported is the long put position if the trader is a 13F filer **and we only get that quarterly**. Plus, the big advantage of this strategy is that you don't have to pay to borrow shares to do this and you don't have to worry about whether there are even shares to borrow.

Here is a quick and dirty example:

A. Gabe can short 100 shares of GME right now $215 a share. He will have to pay a fee for borrowing the shares, but he gets $21,500. He will also report this as a short position in his next report.

B. Ken simultaneously sells a 3/19 $210 call option and buys a 3/19 $210 put option. If Ken is able to get a net credit of $5.00 per spread, his returns will be identical to Gabe's short position. If Ken gets a higher credit, he does better than Gabe. If Ken gets a lower credit, he does worse than Gabe.

But, while Gabe reports his short position as ""100 shares short GME"" to FINRA. Ken does not because he didn't short shares. Rather, the only thing that will show up is Ken (if he's a 13F filer) will report his long put position in GME. He doesn't disclose the short call position.

Now, where the brown stain really shows up in Ken's tighty-whities is if he actually gets called on the short call. Ken doesn't have a long position because his whole thesis is to short GME. Because he is uncovered, he needs to find shares and even if he does other things to delay the inevitable, those shares will, eventually, have to come from the market.",Unlucky_Falcon1754,7,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m70mqw/3172021_gme_open_interest_report_at_yesterdays/gr8skq5/,0.032,0.868,0.1,0.9661

1. If this is true that would be hilarious!  I propose you call their Investor Dept and demand his resignation and just see what they say.
2. I am guessing as an executive he receives stock as part of compensation so perhaps he simply sells what he gets to increase his cash-in-hand comp on a quarterly/annual basis?
3. I believe he could own in other ways not seen on his individual SEC documents?

You remember the 2020 primaries? Bernie was absolutely everywhere. If you got your news exclusively from Reddit it looked like he was a sure thing for winning the primary. Biden ended up winning a majority of Super Tuesday, and the campaign went downhill from there.

Point I'm trying to make is that the Reddit hivemind is certainly not as smart as people assume it is. Short interest is lower, cost to borrow is lower, and most shorts were covered in January.  

Go to any GME thread, and sort by controversial.  The amount of people I'm seeing spending their life savings at $200/share is insane. These people are going to be absolutely destroyed.

-	Most shorts were covered in January
-	Short interest has been dropping steadily since the squeeze 
-	Cost to borrow GME shares has been dropping too and is currently at an all time low (0.6%)

I also think there could be an element of the wizards holding off at 40 as it looked like it would drop lower as the focus around GME declined, they can't really cover much without causing the price to spike and bring focus back. It was a sudden 2nd spike to over 100 in about 2 hrs of open trading.

***Oh the Money You'll Make!***

Congratulations!  
Today is your day,  
You're on the subreddit  
and you've found a new play!

You've got brains in your head,  
You have feet in your shoes,  
Palantir does computer,  
How could they lose?

You know what you know,  
so you make the deposit  
You've read your DD,  
You step out of the closet

You say you'd like options,  
do you want puts or calls?  
Come on Vlad you say,  
Look at the size of my balls.

Palantir 40s,  
for the end of the week,  
""Load me up Tenev""  
You mightily speak.

Sure, says the Vlad,  
as you press market order,  
You'll make so much money  
and please reddit awarders.

Your email it dings,  
it says execution,  
but your calls suddenly drop,  
It must be institutions!

This must be the fault  
of the hedge funds you say!  
But your hands they are diamond,  
and you've still got 3 days.

The markets are slumping,  
even Cathie is dying,  
You go back to the sub,  
and the OP is crying.

You're starting to panic,  
you're down over ten stacks,  
It must have been hedgies  
short ladder attacks!

So you take out your money,  
as all stocks are in red,  
You know TQQQ calls,  
will make you some bread.

So you buy TQQQ  
and it starts to go down  
Dollar cost averaging,  
you tell all the town,

And now it's Saturday.  
The end of the week.  
You're broke behind Wendy's  
two cocks in your cheeks.

Next week is the one,  
You feel in your heart,  
As you grab a napkin  
for your cumfart.

And that's how it goes  
down at Wallstreetbets,

1761,LEAP," #Once in the land of Terra in the City of MemeStonkia did the venerable James Cramer, level 5 wizard / level 1 warlock, perfect his spell of casting his visage upon the clouds above. Nightly would he prophesy about his visions of the future. 

One day he spoke of the fair weather to come, but instead Vikings from the West raided. Disappointed, the survivors put away their Beach gear and decided not every person with the power to cast their face upon the clouds was particularly worth listening to necessarily.

Years passed and the city was rebuilt. One afternoon a guild of magic using, upper-middle class mercenaries, devoid of any moral alignment, discovered the secret to James's spell and proceeded to have their own visions of the future and discuss them in the tavern sector of main Street, projecting their visages upon the buildings and discussing what they thought.

""Let's all Buy gamestop stocks"" they decided together, some of them being sober enough to notice GameStop stock price would rise with every console release. 

And so they did, but then they had a problem.

The stock was suddenly going to go to 50,000 gold pieces according to some visions. In others it only went to 100. Still others insisted just one share of the stock would grant the owner immortal Life, like a reverse lich or something I don't know. 

And in all the arguing over when to sell it became more and more clear that most would sell at a low price and only a few would wait for a higher one.

Now a certain gnome studying for his PhD in counting things said, ""how about we play a game to determine when we sell our stock? That way we all get maximum profits?""

And this was the game that they made up:

#Everyday you want to sell, flip a coin. On heads sell 10% of your GameStop stock, on tails sell 5%. You must wait 24 hours minimum to flip again.

This game ensured that no one got left with a bag of holding, which was a perfectly reasonable thing to discuss given the circumstances that all these investors found themselves in. 

This didn't mean one witlessely sold every day! It just meant at any time one wanted to sell you would have to flip a coin and wait 24 hours and then flip a coin and then wait 24 hours and then flip a coin and then wait 24 hours. They did the 5 or 10% thing to further maximize profits, using stochastic measured divestment strategies to further flatten volatility and prevent emotional human bias. So at most you would have to flip a coin 20 times in order to sell 100% of your shares, having sold 5% each time you sold, and the fastest you could possibly sell off would be 10 days before you would have zero stock left to sell.

This is part 5. Part one got taken down due to a Clerical error on my part. I'm really Paladin my karma anyway. Fighter flight isn't in my vocabulary, I was bound to LEAP in, given all my options, and if this is finally enough I'll cleave it alone. Whirlwind strike took out parts two, three and IV. Volatile!
