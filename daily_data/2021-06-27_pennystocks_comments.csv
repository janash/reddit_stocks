59,TRCH," > Ladder attack from shorts

or... TRCH was overvalued going into the merger. It's an important fact that TRCH shareholders only get 1 metamaterial share vs. 3 meta shares for existing meta shareholders. If it weren't for the dividend from the sale of assets, TRCH wouldn't be trading any more than $2 (and even that's a stretch considering these companies abysmal financials).

It makes no senses to me that people actually held on rather than selling at $10+. Hate to say it but there is a very low chance that the dividend is going to cover the loss of unrealized profits from holding onto TRCH for the divi later this year (so long as things go to plan) but I sincerely hope for anyone holding on that won't be the case.",WorshipTheSunGods,2,/r/pennystocks/comments/o8x7a3/most_discussed_stocks_in_pennystocks_last_week/h38m1w4/,0.083,0.774,0.143,0.8261

65,CTXR," I'm often wrong, so whatever I say only do it with 50% of your shares to hedge ðŸ˜‚

But my gut says that CTXR is the hot stock of the month but it's almost over. The price has steadily gone up until last week, when it hit $4.5 (I sold at $4.2) and dumped to $3.5, climbed to $4.2 and dipped to $3.6, climbed to $4.xx and dipped to $3.8 (current price). It's clearly unstable and while it's a great channel to trade in for 10% gains, I don't see it getting much higher than $4.5.

I can see two different outcomes...
1- my expectation: It continues the up and down cycle, with dips to buy and highs above $4, until whatever the ""sell the news"" crowd deems is news is dropped and then the price falls to <$3.5 or even below $3. Since 6/29 is the date used for the catalyst, I think it may hit a local maximum Monday or Tuesday of this week (but they may wait until the actual news drops). 

2- Optimistic possibility: It continues the up and down cycle but builds over the next week, with higher lows until favorable news drops (between 6/29-7/9, whenever it drops) and it briefly spikes up to $5+. Then it will fade down to current levels or below.


Personally, I'm counting on option #1 and sold because I hit 100% profits. My plan was to buy back in at $3.5 but I missed that dip, so I'm holding off for now. I'd highly recommend locking in profit with 1/3 or 1/2 your shares, since you're up 100%, because I've gotten burned repeatedly by not locking in profits and watching them turn to losses.

I think $8+ is a realistic possibility within 12 months, when the FDA approval happens, but I don't think it is a reasonable price target in the next two weeks. I'd sell some or all at a peak and then wait a few months to buy back in.",PsycheRevived,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/o8x7a3/most_discussed_stocks_in_pennystocks_last_week/h392miz/,0.048,0.832,0.12,0.9814

121,ZOM," I wouldn't put a lot into ZOM right now. I worked at a vet hospital over the last 10 months and their product seems more like an accessory to a standard practice rather than a necessary feature.  $IDXX is the lab company we work with who would provide a similar service (we ship them samples, they digitally provide results, takes \~ a day or two.   with the difference being results are available in about an hour vs. in \~ two days. 

From what I understand the competitive advantage to this technology is the rapid pace of test result delivery, the detail and accuracy provided by the results, and the ability to test thyroid in-house. 

Their competitors are at an advantage because they provide external laboratory services at low-prices, with results in a few days. Those companies are equipped with more up-to-date testing equipment that is replaced quickly, and most likely will provide services to a vet hospital whether that office has a Zomedica machine or not. Then the question becomes whether the opportunity cost is there to own a machine in the first place.

I think this would be a purchase to consider for a new clinic or a place updating their machines, and I think COVID thinned out the industry, increasing demand for practices that survived and ending practices that were on their way out. It could also be considered for a practice that has seen an increased flow of traffic, but generally this test is not one that requires just-in-time results.

That being said, not only is this not financial advice, this is my personal opinion formed as a customer service rep of a vet hospital who is not involved in the administration of medical care. In terms of pennystocks, I think this would be a good company to hold long-term, as they expand their offerings and gain some traction as veterinarians upgrade their equipment in time, but I don't see the shift in the industry to send this stock to the moon",Radiant-Bandicoot-65,3,/r/pennystocks/comments/o8t9ul/eyes_or_zom_which_is_worth_for_investment/h386drb/,0.004,0.907,0.089,0.9749
