25,AI," 1. Delta will not be a repeat of the OG Covid Crash. Completely different circumstances. Covid in 2020 blindsided the market and the world; we had no defense against this strange and unknown virus, except to shut down the world basically. Delta? First, we have vaccines that work against it. Perhaps slightly less effective at preventing transmission, but still enormously effective at preventing death and severe disease. Second, everybody knows everything there is to know about it. We know it will cause infections to tick up, like in the UK. Yet, the UK case surge appears to have slowed, without the need for extremely draconian measures like with OG Covid. It would take a black swan to blindside the market again; a new variant that completely evades the vaccine and sets us back to square one. Delta isn't that.
2. This one I can agree on. Valuations are extreme, and will eventually come down. We just don't know when though. Could be next week, next month, or next year. You can sit on the sidelines in cash and miss out on the blow off top, or define your risk and invest what you are comfortable with losing a portion of.
3. I don't believe the inflation narrative for a second. The 5.4% YoY increase is due to temporary issues. Supply chain havoc? Not a long term problem. Stimulus money? Saved, used to pay debt, or invested. Either way, banks end up with that money and they don't spend it in an inflationary manner, i.e. by buying groceries and cars. Another round of stimulus will not happen unless we get another black swan event. Most of that inflation is probably just prices recovering from when they tanked in 2020. Remember oil? Prices collapsed in March 2020, I hadn't seen gas so cheap in decades. Now it's back to its normal price and everyone's losing their minds over inflation. It's easy to set a growth figure so high when your base level is zero. We're still in the same economic paradigm as we have been for the past few decades; namely, defined by a stagnating and aging population and labor force. Interest rates have been on the decline for decades, any increase would be temporary. In order to create economic growth in this economy without structural growth, we just print more and more debt, and kick the can down the road. We're not about to stop doing that now. I am very confident that YoY inflation in 2022 will be much lower than what we've seen this year.
4. New industries will spring up to support continued economic growth, but indeed, not in time for this bull market. AI, biotech, spaceflight--these will revolutionize our world and create billions of dollars of growth, but probably not this decade.",JustinianIV,36,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/optda9/bear_case_top_economies_have_covid_cases/h687zw6/,0.082,0.77,0.148,0.9876

198,DD," I buy eastern DRC tin miners for peace of mind

There is a massive expansion of chip manufacturing happening and all those chips need solder. Over 50% of the world's tin is used for solder. It's been in a short squeeze since January and is still insanely squeezed. Tin is the best performing commodity out there YTD and YoY.

My miner is $AFMJF 

My futures are from $JJT

Now she is overweight on TSLA and underweight on AAPL and NVDA, so she would sell TSLA shares and use the proceeds to buy AAPL and NVDA shares in order to maintain her original 50/30/20 allocation.

With the push in congress to fund Medicare to a whole new level they‚Äôre bound to be selected for a major deal in the coming years.

I'm not telling you to buy the stock but the company is a money printer right now. 5B cash expected annually and that's not even considering the prices of HRC steel right now which is considered to be above 1600/ton. Their contracts have them selling it at around 900/ton and are being renewed late into this year - most likely upwards. The company trades at a ~10B valuation and prints half of it's value in the coming year...

538,HRC," A little more than a year ago CLF was ""just an iron mining company"", now they are a steelmaking company that is capable of being self-sufficient in resource production. The company takes ore from the ground and turns it into chad metal. It is operating some of the best facilities in the world for it.

I'm not telling you to buy the stock but the company is a money printer right now. 5B cash expected annually and that's not even considering the prices of HRC steel right now which is considered to be above 1600/ton. Their contracts have them selling it at around 900/ton and are being renewed late into this year - most likely upwards. The company trades at a ~10B valuation and prints half of it's value in the coming year...

The biggest bear case I see is some further environmental regulations putting it in the industry ass but steel is forever great and the process of making it will keep printing cash for the company for years",paskaak,13,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/opwu2w/clf_a_highly_interesting_play/h686p9c/,0.027,0.898,0.075,0.8126

Mostly I stick to SPY, end of month expiries (tho 1-2 weeks out sometimes too). I don't go all in on stuff, and will scale up on red days or down on green days. if there's a 100% gain I'll usually cut the position and wait for a re-entry. I don't play too far otm either.

I don't think any of this is news to anyone, I just kinda found some rules/framework that worked for me.

805,BAM," I learned a valuable lesson once trying to get an orchid to reflower. 
Lots of sunlight and drip irrigation by means of a daily ice cube had zero effect on coaxing the little bastard to bloom.
As I generally have a brown thumb I thought, let me do the complete opposite.
I put the orchid in the middle of my apartment away from the window, and watered sparingly once in a week and BAM , out she comes.

I admire your attempt to go against the grain but I think your trying to grow an orange tree in Vermont.

808,CMG," I've used Motley Fool for years, as one part of my balanced informational diet.

I hate their marketing with a passion. That said, their picks on the whole have been very profitable for me, but ONLY WHEN I pick and choose the ones that make sense rather than just following all of them blindly.

Example: I wouldn't touch LMND with a ten-foot pole except maybe to short them when they hit all time highs. As I recall they recommended them at about $65. So actually not a bad call, but not one I'd follow. 

Quite a few of their previous recs have been very good - OKTA for example, which I bought around $27 at their suggestion. Or ISRG and CMG.

I personally don't see much to like about FVRR - I think it's an easily replicable model, and I find the whole idea of ""race to the bottom"" marketplaces as gross anyway (though that wouldn't stop me from investing if I liked the biz model).",1coin3lives,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oq3hh6/fool_recs/h6ao17o/,0.048,0.796,0.155,0.9564
