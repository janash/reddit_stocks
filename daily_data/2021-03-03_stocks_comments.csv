I'm not saying PLTR won't go up, but it's already gone up a lot because of social media - this companys stock has probably benefitted more from social media buzz than any other stock. This effect due to social media will slow down. As that happens I'm predicting many other companies that has far more impact on Americans daily lives will go up faster than PLTR.

Here is some of the DD from u/charzhar

**Price Target: $0.5 by May 1, 2021; $1.25 - $3.00 (\~10x) within 2 years with credible potential to be listed on NASDAQ.**

This company is absolutely solid on all sides: healthy financials, an experienced & reliable management team, favorable market conditions with a reasonable business model, a solid lineup of products in its pipeline, and many large announcements anticipated within the next 3 months. Simply put, there is extreme asymmetric upside.

$CTYX or Connectyx was taken over by its current team led by CEO Paul Michaels around Feb 2020. Within a year, this CEO has kept every promise he's made and established the infrastructure for growth. The company specializes in bringing orphan drugs (more on this below) through clinical trials and then to market. Paul and his team have decades of experience in big pharma, biotech research, finance, and drug licensing/development (in-depth description in the Management Team section below). They've vetted 3 promising drug candidates in under a year and promised to start clinical trials by mid-2022. If any one of these pass phase 1/2 trials, the market cap grows by hundreds of millions. They also have a reasonable chance to obtain a Priority Review Voucher (PRV) from the FDA that is worth $100-$300M from their strategic picks. They have a clean balance sheet, acquired non-dilute bridge financing while putting these drugs through trials, and have plans of additional deals in the near future.

Why orphan drugs? Orphan drugs are therapeutics that treat rare diseases (defined as illnesses affecting less than 200k Americans per year). From the [Orphan Drug Act](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Orphan_Drug_Act_of_1983#:~:text=The%20Orphan%20Drug%20Act%20of,residing%20in%20the%20United%20States), there are multiple incentives given by the government to develop orphan drugs: (1) significant tax credits (2) longer market exclusivity after approval (3) waiver of certain FDA fees (4) easier & faster approval process. In 2019, the global orphan drug market is estimated to be valued at $151B. By 2027, this is projected to reach [$340.84B](https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/industry-reports/orphan-drugs-market-100088) (10% compounded annual growth). This the cornerstone of their [business model](https://connectyx.com/about-us/). By gathering a group of experts, they can cheaply vet high potential candidates to add to their development pipeline and then commercialize them from reduced fees as well as fast-track benefits from the FDA.

So why the hell is it call Connectyx? It is just the old name of a software services company which the team acquired. The company has filed for a name change that will be granted within the next 2 weeks to Curative Biotechnology Inc. with a new ticker $CURB. In addition, the CEO himself has hinted at an uplisting to $OTCQB (a certification upgrade from current pink sheet status), merger/acquisition announcements, and $100M in non-dilutive funding. The official FINRA announcement of the name change will be the catalyst for the additional news.

Some quick notes about the charts. The 15x jump in the past couple of months is only the beginning. There is a clear trend of resistance breakthroughs and medium-term consolidation after each announcement. Volatility is low, the number of outstanding shares is small, and there is limited dilutive potential for an OTC.",EducationalYak4527,3,/r/stocks/comments/lwt9oz/what_stocks_do_you_believe_are_currently/gpjcuy5/,0.022,0.854,0.124,0.9927

249,ATNF," ATNF - 180 Life Sciences Corp. Min. 1 year investment.

I‚Äôve been doing a lot of research on this biotech company the last few weeks and believe it is far undervalued and is flying under the radar. Currently $4.43/share. Company was founded by the best of the best, including co-founder Prof. Raphael Mechoulam ""The Godfather of Cannabis Research"". Vanguard recently took an institutional stake in the company (12.5%) in both their Group and Index funds. Their Early Dupuytren‚Äôs therapy is in its final phase (Phase 3) and results are expected Q4 2021, which will tap into a conservative $4.5B US/UK market once FDA approved.

250,IMO," PepsiCo. Someone else mentioned Coca Cola, also not a bad play, but I much prefer Pepsi due to their more diversified portfolio and more innovative/growth-oriented approach. They are also much better prepared to capitalize on recent health/sustainability trends with subsidiaries such as Naked juice, Quaker Oats, and Sodastream. Defensive stocks like Pepsi have been out of favor, but won't be for long with inflation/interest rate hikes looming. Pepsi currently has a 3%+ dividend with strong growth prospects and IMO the best bet for consistent 12-15% annualized returns for the next 10 years.",Gillioni,3,/r/stocks/comments/lwt9oz/what_stocks_do_you_believe_are_currently/gpjknj3/,0.029,0.683,0.288,0.9838

280,HUGE," Gap , that is $GPS, the clothing brand, I think could be a grower. 

They have a huge number of store locations, so through the pandemic took a hit with those being closed, the stock price has now recovered to just above pre-pandemic prices so perhaps a bargain has been missed, however...   
They own a few brands, notably 'Athleta', a sport clothing brand that is growing in popularity and may do well as gyms reopen and summer approaches, and of course GAP, which is starting to be 'cool' again with a trend toward Y2K looks and 90s/2000s styles being bolstered on tiktok etc- this might not last, but could be the next 'champion'. Over the pandemic they have continued to sell online and with good brands in their repotoire, what is to stop them from becoming another ASOS, but with a better reputation regarding sustainability which is something they have been focusing on. They have also recently re-located their headquarters, to reduce overheads. 

and the big one: They have still got a deal in the works with Kanye West's Yeezy brand. This could be HUGE, hype clothing communities will go wild for anything with the kanye name on it, and leaks/rumours have already gone viral showing there is a lot of hype for the collection. The deal is allegedly a 10 year deal, and could see GAP grow like adidas did after releasing Yeezy shoes. Rumours from october suggested that the Yeezy Gap collection was going well and expected to release in the spring, possibly not long from now. of course, it might never arrive as is often the case with Kanye projects, but i feel like the risk with GAP is fairly low, they should continue to do okay on their other strengths for a while, with the possibility of a larger gain if the Yeezy collection comes to fruition",NorthWal,2,/r/stocks/comments/lwt9oz/what_stocks_do_you_believe_are_currently/gpjk293/,0.03,0.846,0.125,0.9817

There has been tons of positive catalyst news since then (like for instance the news that Tesla switched from Nvidia to AMD in their cars, also that AMD tech is powering the next gen of Samsung phones) but the stock is not budging. I think we will see it rip in the later part of the year.

AMD at the moment has leading tech in CPUs, GPUs and FPGAs. AMD and Xilinx are at the forefront of chiplet research. Which opens up a whole new world of possibilities.

Also once the merger goes through later this year or begging of 2022, because Xilinx is such a solid company AMD balance sheet will improve even more. This joint company is a cash cow in the making.

‚Ä¢ ‚Äò18 US Gov. placed natural graphite on Critical Minerals List of materials critical to the national economy and national security of the US

‚Ä¢ The US currently has NO domestic natural graphite production (US: 100% reliant on imports \~ China: produces 70% of the world‚Äôs supply)

‚Ä¢ Gov. admin. prioritizes ‚ÄúMade in America‚Äù (include ‚Äúmined in America‚Äù) 

‚Ä¢ GM intends to stop producing combustion-engine cars by 2035

‚Ä¢ Ceylon hired 2 world leading researchers/innovators in graphite prod development

‚Ä¢ Ceylon Graphite Commences Expanded 2021 Drill Program 

Ceylon Graphite is one of the few producing graphite companies in the world, outside of China and one of a very few with access to high grade vein graphite with average purity >90% Cg, a grade level which eliminates the need for an expensive primary upgrading plant commonly required for flake graphite found in most parts of the world.

The Company has completed the planned upgrades to the shaft at the K1 mine. These include the installation of new structural supports in the development drifts (tunnels) to 160 feet, a new compressor and improvement to the ventilation systems within the K1 mine. The mine is now capable of achieving 5,000 tons of production per annum.

‚ÄúProduction will scale over 2021 and beyond,‚Äù said Bharat Parashar, Chief Executive Officer and Board Chair of Ceylon Graphite. ‚ÄúThe company expects, and has previously announced, it will reach a sustainable run rate of 5,000 tons per mine, with K1 being the first to hit that target.‚Äù

The company also continues to develop its M1 and H1 mine sites, with both having already secured an exploration license. As previously announced the Company expects the M1 mine will achieve a full production license from the Geological Survey and Mines Bureau by Q3 of 2021. Drilling at the H1 site is in full swing with both drilling rigs in operation.

The updated 2021 drilling program has been designed to:

* Follow up the successful 2019 drill campaign at the H1 site
* Assess VLF data (conductivity) to understand vein direction
* Develop additional drill targets along known veins to help identify quantity and depth as well as identify offshoot veins, vein intersections and caverns.
* Confirmation and formalization of resource estimate for H1 over the following 6 months
* Start geological work and drilling in the rest of the 10 prioritized grids with the second Sarcon drill.
* Provide sufficient date to file 43-101 compliant resource reports for each site.
* Oversight of the drilling program by Senior Consultant Geologist Dr. Ranjith¬†Premasiri. Dr.¬†Premasiri has a PhD In Geophysics from the United Kingdom and is a Chartered Geologist. He is a Professor in the Department of Earth Resources at Moratuwa University in Sri Lanka (Department Head 2016-2019). He has also worked at the Geological Society and Mines Bureau of Sri Lanka. He is currently the President of the Geological Society of Sri Lanka and was General Secretary of the Institute of Geology, Sri Lanka 2009 ‚Äì 2016.

405,LEAP," Round numbers: Apple is trading today at $125/share. 1 Option March 2023 @ 125 strike is $25/share. You can buy 5 Leaps for $125, and if the price of Apple goes above $150 before March 2023 you break even. Between $125-150 you lose some money. Less than $125 you lose all of it.

Every dollar above $150 Apple is at you get 5x more gain than you would if you bought stock. So if you think 2 years from now Apple will be trading at $300, and think it is very unlikely that it will trade below $150 you can buy LEAPS and leverage your money.

Dumbed down to exclude dividends, exercising early, and the math between a breakeven of buying stock or LEAPS.

For an example of expensive LEAPS, look at $BB. Stock is trading at $10, LEAP is $5 at $12 strike. It's gotta go to like $20 or something in order to be better than just buying stock.

406,MA," > Valuation: The CAPE smoothed P/E multiple has expanded for six straight months. It bottomed at 24.8 in March at the price index trough, closed December at 33.7, then to 34.5 in January, and now to 34.8 in February. By way of comparison, the multiple was 32.3 in March 2001, as the tech wreck bear market really got going; and 32.6 in September 1929. Investors always think they can get out before the peak is in. History rhymes.

P/E is backward looking, and earnings have been depressed by the pandemic.  Earnings are expected to grow by 23% in 2021, which will drive P/E back down if stocks go up less than that.  CAPE measures a decade worth of earnings, so it's possible it could simply deflate back to historical norms over a long period of time without any crash.

> Leverage: Margin debt has soared 42% from a year ago (+115% at an annual rate over the past three months alone). This is exactly what the trend was in August 2007 and September 2000. Right near the market peaks.

Stocks have soared 28%, and interest rates are still lower than a year ago.  It seems entirely plausible to me that the ratio of cost of borrowing relative to equity is unchanged with these numbers, in which case investors would not be over-borrowing.

> Positioning: The put-call volume ratio has been below 0.60 with near consistency since the middle of November. It‚Äôs a stretch we haven‚Äôt seen in over eight years. The BofA survey shows that global portfolio managers are running with the lowest cash levels in eight years, and have the highest exposures to equities and commodities in a decade.

Does that signal a bubble, or just investors recognizing we are poised for a roaring economy, and that people are going to be fleeing fixed income assets as rates rise?

> Technicals: The fact that the S&P 500 is now 13% above its 200-day moving average is an extreme gap worth noting and monitoring ‚Äî it was 11% back in February 2000, just ahead of the tech mania bust and 7% in October 2018, ahead of the near-20% drawdown heading into the end of that year.

It was also 13% above its 200-day moving average in 2011, and 11% in 2010, 2013, 2014.

Here's what I think, people who post things like this didn't buy in during the March crash and are STILL sitting in cash because they thought the market was going lower. Now not only has it gone back to ATH, it's gone much further. 

Being triggered by this, they then research and seek out bearish information and stats that help them cope and reinforce their belief that they are correct and the market will crash and they'll get to buy in at the bottom.

It's useful to think about what ""emotion"" means... For example, some people will do what they perceive to be due diligence but they're working backwards, picking the facts that rationalize their emotionally-driven buy, rather than pressure testing their hypothesis.

To me, what (lack of) emotion really means is: You have to be willing to walk away, knowing that there is always going to be another opportunity that meets your strict criteria.  Quick story:

I was shopping for a new car as our old Honda was approaching 170,000 miles.  We got a good ten years out of it.  So I found the exact car I wanted, which was a newer Honda.  I had determined my price and my terms in advance.  I talked to the dealer, and they came in high.  So I said I'm not interested but let me know when you can meet my price.

Every month for about 3-4 months I'd get a call from the sales rep close to the end of the month, like clockwork‚Äîthey've got to hit their quota numbers for the month.  They'd ask, ""Are you ready to buy the car?"" and I'd reply, ""Are you ready to give me my price?  No.  Ok, talk to you next month!""

Finally, I get an email from the Sales Director, and she says she can meet my price.  So my wife and I go in, we go through the paperwork and we get to the financing, and these guys tell me they can give me the $6k discount off sticker -OR- the 0.9% APR.  I wanted both.  So I said thanks but no, and started to close my binder... they back up and do the old, ""Let me talk to my financing guy and see what we can do.""

There is *always* wiggle room in these deals... they just have to have a manager sign off on it.  I also know that the particular car I'm looking at is one they find very hard to sell because most people seem to think going up to the Acura ILX is a better deal... it isn't.  So I throw in there: *Look, I've been your customer for ten years.  You can close this deal today and hit your numbers AND secure ten more years of scheduled maintenance, or you can leave that money on the table and every day it sits in the lot from here on out you're going to have to start dropping the price anyway.*

The difference between this deal and an emotional deal is that when you make an emotional purchase you keep looking in the garage wondering, ""Did I do the right thing?""

It also means that perhaps there is enough demand on the dips to provide upward resistance.

I take this as a bullish sign. The company itself is so top-of-mind it's obscene. I wouldn't bet against something that is so engrained in the modern zeitgeist.

I also wouldn't bet against something that basically provides income for a large number of people, in a world where traditional employment is becoming harder and harder to come by. This is why I'm also so bullish on Shopify.

In today's employment environment, there's really nothing more powerful than an income-providing platform (Youtube, EBay, TikTok, Uber, Shopify, AirBnB etc.) because people will fight for it like they fight for their own livelihoods. ABNB recognized it, and basically cemented these peoples' loyalty by offering them special stock options at an attractive price.

474,ABNB," It is less to do with the ""product"" and more to do with ""what creates more jobs and taxable income"".

 Governments and apartment buildings have been putting AirBnBs a hard time in terms of restrictions for a while now. In the past there have been restrictions on how many can be run out of the same buildings and the same neighborhoods, as well as HOA fighting to limit them. With these factors already at play, I could see a few more hurdles put in the way by municipal and possibly federal governments to try and divert some of the flow back towards the hotel industry. 

I don't think they would substantially limit growth of ABNB, but it would slow it down a little. I may be wrong, I just wanted to taper expectations. I have seen a lot of posts saying that when restrictions are lifted theaters, restaurants, concerts and short term rental options are going to explode in a good way, but restrictions being lifted entirely is still about 6 months away. That's plenty of time for new policies and procedures to be proposed and implemented.

TLDR: Always be screening new information in your area about how things will be handled and be cautious when investing based purely on speculation.

What would you define as buying or selling too soon? What time horizons are you looking at? You might be buying into a company as a great opportunity, but have to wait 6-12+ months for the price to go up significantly. In the meantime the price can tank, even though the fundamentals are solid (and suggest the price should go up).

I mean, I understand it has to do with your money being tied up while it could be growing somewhere else, but one of the things out of your control is WHEN the stock goes up (assuming your DD is correct).

That said I'm not going to full stop occasionally going so the roulette wheel on my brokerage app but recognizing the difference and what you're doing is important. That's more difficult when there's some mob mentality. 

I got burned on a couple hyped up SPACs because I was thinking I was investing when I was actually speculating and gambling. 

FOMO is tough... My first experience was right before TSLA really took off (before split) and I set a limit that it never dipped below so instead of buying at 750, I missed and I tried again at 900 and ended up not buying till 1100. Still a good investment based off the past several months but it told me to be less patient about a stock and buy if I think it'll go up rather than be a litte more patient. 

So this past month I picked up a couple SPACs with the lesson learned from TSLA. That was also incorrect. There's nothing to do but learn and learning the hard way is how most learning happens.",Skyagunsta21,1,/r/stocks/comments/lwg1pw/taking_a_break_from_investing/gpi2dif/,0.049,0.898,0.054,0.0414

493,USA," Generally a three-fund portfolio consists of:

* A total USA stock market fund such as VTI (ETF)/VTSAX(Mutual fund)
* A total international stock index fund such as VXUS/VTIAX
* A total bond fund such as BND/VBTLX

The above are the vanguard ETF's which are generally considered some of the best in the industry - low cost and high quality.   There are other options as well in these categories.

Occasionally a 4th fund of international bonds are added.  See [https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund\_portfolio](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund_portfolio) and r/Bogleheads for more details and how to figure out how much to hold of each.",Pass_Little,3,/r/stocks/comments/lwg1pw/taking_a_break_from_investing/gpi5imo/,0.023,0.908,0.069,0.6369

___

In general I stick only with sectors and industries that I am familiar with.  That way, I know pretty quickly what to look for in terms what their product or service is, and if its of any quality.

Then I'll look at their ""fundamentals.""  Their revenue, assets, profit, and debt.  I like to see a history of these numbers for the past 5 years, if the company has been around at least that long.  There are more fundamentals, but those are the four I look for.  As you read more and more of these about more and more companies, you'll learn more and more about which details there matter.

Try to find moves the company has made to get better position.  Sourcing deals, partnerships, spinoffs, mergers, anything.  Seeing jumps or drops in stock price history can hint about what time frame in which those events occurred.

Then I take a gander at the competition.

After that, I look at leadership.  You need to know about the people calling the shots, because they determine whether the company is successful, stagnant, or failing.  They determine the vision, direction, and path to their goals.  A company with a great product, lots of profit, tons of assets, and little debt doesn't mean shit to me if their *new* CEO is SuckBob FuckPants.  Bad leaders can tank good companies.

Conversely, good leadership can save failing companies. 

So find out who's calling the shots, who the CEO is, CTO or whatever, head of research, anyone.  Their career history, the track records of previous companies they've worked for (did they save something or tank it, or just meh?), where they went to school, etc.  It doesn't have to be FBI-class dossiers, but you should be able to name names and say ""They did such and such at X company before, and now they're at Y and building/doing an even better version!""

Fight your own confirmation bias.  Look for potential obstacles for that company, and give them real consideration.  This is why I stick to things that I know - I'll already be familiar with industry trends and common obstacles.  By doing this, I can skip writing many pages about obstacles.

The reason to do any DD is to inform yourself, but it helps me to pretend like I'm writing for a group of serious investors.  Once you've read, summarized, sorted and collated all of the relevant info and have a nice 5-pager, you can take a day off, then read the whole thing over again with a clear head.

And have fun.  I'm weird, but DD is hella fun for me.  I have no idea why.",runningAndJumping22,37,/r/stocks/comments/lwj84t/how_to_dd_what_do_i_look_for_what_should_i_focus/gpi2k18/,0.082,0.762,0.157,0.9908

497,AAPL," DD is good, but there's much more to it. If you learn nothing else from this long post, it's this: test your gut feelings against cold, hard facts to see how right or wrong you are. 

Devote yourself to learning and reading. Start with some basic metrics, like topline revenue, profit margin, ROE. Pick stocks, or industries, or sectors you think you understand. Commit to a certain number of hours per day or per week diving into numbers. 

Start making concrete predictions and holding yourself accountable. (ie: I think stock X will be at price Y on date Z.) Keep track of these predictions and review your work. A good one to start with is: ""Do you think the S&P 500 will be higher or lower 3 months from today?"" What about 6 months? End of year? Evaluate your gut feelings against cold, hard facts. Do this for individual stocks too. Do it for AMZN, TSLA, NIO, RKT, CAT, JNJ, and MMM. Keep a spreadsheet. Document your accuracies and inaccuracies. 

While you're starting down your path, keep your real money relatively low risk. Either have your funds in low-risk plays, or only put a small amount of your funds into the high risk plays you're interested in. 

On that note, one of the most important things to be honest with yourself about is, how well do you understand risk? How risky is it to put all your money into AAPL, vs MSFT, vs VOO, vs QQQ, vs (insert penny stock of choice here)? How do you tweak your portfolio so it matches your risk tolerance?

508,CRSP," I think the part about understanding the industry really is true, I've found there have been many times I've been recommended a stock, but very hesitant to invest in it, more from not fully understanding what they do, it's especially true in my case with industries like biotech and pharmaceutical. For instance I was recommended CRSP recently, but couldn't understand it, so ended up moving elsewhere. 

On another note, there are many companies I personally really enjoy using in real life, like Peloton, Etsy, Shopify, Roku. They were all companies many actually criticized in the beginning, people telling me it's just a bike company, or Amazon is better with eCommerce, or Apple is coming with their own TV service. It's actually because I use all of them, I can invest in them with much more confidence. My biggest regret to this day is starring at Roku at IPO and not buying them, because someone on Reddit told me it was a basic TV company, which has gone up over 20-folds since. All of those 4 stocks, since IPO have flourished and gone up multiple folds. Thankfully I stood my ground and bought the other 3 as an early comer, largely since I've actually used a Peloton, have worked in eCommerce, and enjoy watching TV and streaming services. 

The beauty of the stock market is compared to almost any area of life, the number and bank accounts never lie, unlike school or corporate America, where it's easy to sometimes just gain favoritism from popularity or bias reasons, the stock market is as real as can be, with some exceptions, like wall street manipulating prices.",LifeInAction,2,/r/stocks/comments/lwj84t/how_to_dd_what_do_i_look_for_what_should_i_focus/gpi9mdf/,0.047,0.749,0.205,0.9943

This 1000%.  The less familiar I am with a company, the less likely I am to invest unless something super, super intriguing has happened (re: GME)

You've mentioned biotech and pharmaceutical.  I'm watching biotech like a hawk, and wishing I got in on CRSP when it was $15, especially after Cathie Wood name-dropped them several weeks ago and they rocketed to $200.

I've had good luck sniping tech IPOs and some solar when at value.  The market is drunk on tech and revved up on IPOs, so I hate to say it, but it's kinda been easy money.  No way do I think I'm ""good"" at this though.  I just keep getting lucky.

535,UK," I'd be wary of how much these companies can rely on F35.

The significant delays the fighter has suffered means that it is launching too late and its operational life will be shorter than perhaps initially hoped. This is part of the reason why the UK is very cautious about buying the full 135 fighters it initially had on order.

Instead, the UK is working to develop a new fighter, Tempest, for service in the 2030s onwards and several countries are joining in the endeavour. It may also be why the US Air Force has been looking at the F16X (I think that is what it is called) because this 5th generation of fighters has come too late and the 6th generation will be needed.

**TESLA SHOULD BUY FORD**

I have changed my opinion on TSLA. I expected them to go bankrupt.  So far, Tesla has been unable to make a profit solely manufacturing cars.   Tesla has been perpetually selling shares to raise cash.   New competition seems to come online every day.  Tesla is no longer the number one EV in China.

TSLA‚Äôs global market share has been shrinking as Volkswagen along with numerous new Chinese EV makers come onto to the scene.  TSLA sold the most electric cars last year, but market share in Europe and China has been falling. Toyota, Ford, GM, BMW, Mercedes are not small players and will continue to grab more and more sales from TSLA as they bring their EV models online. JD Power ranked Tesla 30 out of 33 for reliability. And just recently an independent test showed TSLA failed to meet its EPA range numbers. Only one other company did that, Polestar. All of the others managed to meet or exceed their EPA numbers.

With serious quality issues, inability to make a profit solely from manufacturing, EPA standards misses, I expected TSLA to be out of business in five years.

I have changed my opinion on TSLA simply due to their market cap as investors have bid the stock to ridiculous values.

**Market Caps of Automakers**

TSLA $821 billion

Ford $45 billion  GM $80 billion  Toyota $212 billion Volkswagen $110 billion

**2020 Vehicle Production**

TSLA 500,000

Ford 2 million  GM 2.5 million  Toyota 8.8 million  Volkswagen 10 million

What do you do when you see your market share falling and companies that make many multiples of your output start crowding your markets? You buy them if you can. TSLA could make an offer to any of these companies with TSLA stock at significant premiums anytime Elon Musk wants to. 

Of these, Ford still has $1 billion in Federal tax credits as they haven‚Äôt produced any EV cars to speak of. The rest have already received theirs. Elon loves to get new cash in. He simply could offer one tenth of his market cap or $82 billion in TSLA stock for Ford‚Äôs $45 billion. 

Ford also just reported they have $38 billion in cash with total liquidity of $45 Billion. I‚Äôll repeat, Elon loves cash. For this cash, he could swap TSLA stock and receive $1 billion in future tax credits along with $45 Billion in liquidity. And get the rest of Ford for FREE including the well-reviewed E-Mustang. I want one and I bet Elon does too.

Ford generates four to five times the free cash flow that TSLA does. Ford has hundreds of manufacturing plants around the world. Ford has proven they can profitably build cars AT SCALE. TSLA is nowhere near building cars in quantities close to what Ford builds.

Ford suspended the dividend last year due to the Covid pandemic as did GM. Neither has reinstated it but expect both to do so this year. Ford would be eligible for institutional portfolios that require investments to pay dividends.

Tesla has certainly changed the automotive world from the outside looking in. To change it from the inside looking out, he needs Ford‚Äôs manufacturing abilities.

This is not my original idea as it has been floated more than once in the media. Elon Musk said he was open to the idea back in early December. Motley Fool did a video suggesting TSLA buy Ford in late December. Yahoo Finance did a piece at the end of last month.",DowGoldRatio,10,/r/stocks/comments/lwt43o/teslas_competitive_advantage_in_the_next_decade/gpjb2sd/,0.054,0.854,0.093,0.9791

And just recently an independent test showed TSLA failed to meet its EPA range numbers. Only one other company did that, Polestar. All of the others managed to meet or exceed their EPA numbers.

With serious quality issues, inability to make a profit solely from manufacturing, EPA standards misses, I expected TSLA to be out of business in five years.

I have changed my opinion on TSLA simply due to their market cap as investors have bid the stock to ridiculous values.

**Market Caps of Automakers**

Ford $45 billion  GM $80 billion  Toyota $212 billion Volkswagen $110 billion

What do you do when you see your market share falling and companies that make many multiples of your output start crowding your markets? You buy them if you can. TSLA could make an offer to any of these companies with TSLA stock at significant premiums anytime Elon Musk wants to. 

Of these, Ford still has $1 billion in Federal tax credits as they haven‚Äôt produced any EV cars to speak of. The rest have already received theirs. Elon loves to get new cash in. He simply could offer one tenth of his market cap or $82 billion in TSLA stock for Ford‚Äôs $45 billion. 

Ford also just reported they have $38 billion in cash with total liquidity of $45 Billion. I‚Äôll repeat, Elon loves cash. For this cash, he could swap TSLA stock and receive $1 billion in future tax credits along with $45 Billion in liquidity. And get the rest of Ford for FREE including the well-reviewed E-Mustang. I want one and I bet Elon does too.

Ford generates four to five times the free cash flow that TSLA does. Ford has hundreds of manufacturing plants around the world. Ford has proven they can profitably build cars AT SCALE. TSLA is nowhere near building cars in quantities close to what Ford builds.

Ford suspended the dividend last year due to the Covid pandemic as did GM. Neither has reinstated it but expect both to do so this year. Ford would be eligible for institutional portfolios that require investments to pay dividends.

Tesla has certainly changed the automotive world from the outside looking in. To change it from the inside looking out, he needs Ford‚Äôs manufacturing abilities.

697,TSLA," > My gut tells me that TSLA is not more valuable than all the world‚Äôs other car companies combined. 

Tesla and legacy automakers are completely different businesses. Legacy automakers have a ton of debt, are held back by unions, and are being forced to transition their sales from gasoline to electric. The transition to EVs will lower their margins in the short run, and they are stuck with tons of legacy costs that have solidified in their business. 

Tesla, on the other hand, has very little debt, tons of cash, is the undisputed leader in EV technology, and is growing >50% annually while building out multiple new factories. Tesla also built their business from zero recently and does not have much in the way of solidified legacy costs. For Tesla, EV adoption is a growth opportunity rather than a forced transition. Moreover, Tesla‚Äôs software capabilities are in a different league than other automakers, hence the games, video streaming, and tons more monetizable capabilities. Tesla is also making their own innovations in manufacturing such as their super integrated wiring system, their innovative heat pump, single piece casting, and of course their battery innovations. Tesla is also a leader in the nascent and fast growing energy storage market with the highest market share in both residential and utility scale storage. They are also starting to ramp solar deployment back up after they cut out all the marketing costs and are now trying to takeover the market with the most competitive prices instead. Finally, Tesla is a leader in autonomy. They have successfully monetized autonomy with their full self driving package priced at $10k per car with around 15-20% uptake. This is 100% pure margin for them. All of their cars are taking in real world data and training their autonomous neural net, and no other autonomous company has even 1/100th of the data Tesla has. 

In sum, Tesla is tech giant with much, much higher margin and growth potential than traditional auto, which is simply playing catch-up with Tesla.",32no,2,/r/stocks/comments/lwt43o/teslas_competitive_advantage_in_the_next_decade/gpk7it3/,0.061,0.849,0.09,0.8563

699,GM," Most bears will talk about car quality or scalability when comparing Tesla to traditional car makers.

What people need to talk about is software. Cars are becoming software boxes. This will only become more true as time goes on and autonomous vehicles start becoming reality.

Nobody is anywhere near Tesla when it comes to software. Making cars and hardware is hard, but so is making software. The best software engineers aren‚Äôt going to work for GM or Ford or VW. They‚Äôre going to work for Tesla and SpaceX and Apple and Google and the other FAANGs.

Tesla is far and away the leader on autonomous driving data as well.

Once the hardware side of cars is commoditized (I‚Äôd argue we‚Äôre almost there), the differentiator becomes about design and user experience. What car you choose will be the one that resonates with you most and gives you the best experience.

Software and user experience is going to be the great divider when it comes to cars of the future, and I‚Äôll bet on Tesla‚Äôs massive lead and and their software engineering and software design talent over any other car maker.

Tesla probably will survive on name recognition and Elons hype but if you look at what the company is actually doing, you realize how crazy that valuation is. Tesla fanboys have two arguments ‚ÄûIt‚Äôs more than a car company‚Äú and ‚ÄûFuture products‚Äú . Yeah in addition to loosing money selling cars they are also loosing money in other categories. The only thing that makes them money is ev sale credits, which will be gone soon . Many of Elon‚Äòs promises never come to fruition and people are catching on.

**Overview**

Rocket Mortgage is the largest mortgage lender in the US.  Many companies such as Quicken Loans, forsalebyowner.com and lowermybills.com operate under the Rocket umbrella. Rocket is a fintech out of Detroit that offers conventional and government backed mortgages like FHA, VA, and USDA for purchase and refinancing with fixed or adjustable rates. It caters to self-service users who want to apply for a home loan without talking to a human unless it is necessary. Rocket mortgage‚Äôs document and asset retrieval capabilities save users a bunch of time and hassle. Rocket provides great tools, a casual experience, and intuitive interface that tries to anticipate user questions and have answers readily available for them. 

At their core Rocket operates as a mortgage origination business. Using their online website or more commonly, their mobile app people apply for loans or refinancing. Rocket will either approve or deny the loan and rate then do a title insurance check. For this they collect a 0.5% fee. 

Rocket services less than 10% of the loans they originate. Instead the sell them for securitization to sponsored government-backed companies like Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae while retaining the servicing contract and responsibility of collecting payments and acting as liaison with the borrower. In 2019 Rocket made $4.9 billion in this operation.

Rocket also generates revenue by offering additional services such as marketing, real estate services, and title insurance, which in 2019 generated an additional $839 million in revenue.

**What Makes Rocket Different?**

First, they are best at what they do. Their online only model allows them to close loans on average 25% faster than their competitors at a lower cost. They have a 75% retention rate for refinancing (industry avg. 22%) and a JD Power Net Promoter Score of 74. 

They are unencumbered by capital requirements like traditional banks which is the main reason they can close loans so much faster and why their traditional bank counterparts have not followed suit. They can‚Äôt.

 **Risks**

¬∑ When interest rates stop falling and the refinancing market dries up, like so many others they might be tempted to hold more mortgages on their balance sheet to generate income.

¬∑ Mortgage companies tend to have low revenue visibility and limited revenue sustainability

¬∑ Margins highly correlated to industry volumes

¬∑ Leveraged capital structure brings with it, inherent risk

 **Forward Looking**

Rocket Companies have huge upside potential. They use their existing relationships to cross-sell their other financial products and the auto/personal loan markets remain largely untapped. Using an estimated growth rate of 16% I find that the fair-value of the stock around $35.",rbmrph,1,/r/stocks/comments/lwf73q/will_rkt_drop_tomorrow_thoughts/gpidhog/,0.032,0.887,0.081,0.9674

772,GME," Hi there. Will help with what I know, although I‚Äôm new to this as well. 

1) Investing should rarely, if ever, be tied to an emotional attachment. If you want to own a piece of a company you love, buy shares in the Green Bay Packers. A lot of people have fond memories of taking pictures with Santa at Macy‚Äôs or renting VHS tapes from Blockbuster. Invest based on the future, not the past. 

2) There are a number of hardcore financial measurements that can sort of give you an indicator about a company‚Äôs relative fair value. It‚Äôs not exact by any means. Conventional financial analysis doesn‚Äôt apply to a company like Tesla for example, or meme stocks like GME. But you basically want to look for a solid, growing company that hasn‚Äôt reached its potential yet and isn‚Äôt about to get crushed by a competitor. 

3) Use broker resources. I have Fidelity and Morgan Stanley in addition to my RobinHood cheat sheet. RH is basically worthless. Other resources though will give you a rough assessment, to the best of their ability. For example, I may look at Morningstar and Morgan Stanley to see where they think Moderna should be (fair) or where it could be (target). If I see a stock that a lot of different places think could be higher than where it is, that‚Äôs one I‚Äôd look closer at .

4) DO NOT put 100% of your money into any 1 stock. If you want to fire and forget just take your cash and stick it into a nice ETF that covers a bunch of companies. VOO is a popular one. A bunch of S&P indexes exist, which basically just buy a lot of the whole market in the assumption that no one can outthink the market average (mostly true). Or, you can pick someone you really like and go with them - a lot of folks are hot on the ARK ETFs right now.

5) None of this is financial advice. I just lost a ton when it was announced that Johnson and Johnson and Merk would collaborate on vaccine manufacturing. I thought I was smart. Maybe I‚Äôm not. 

6) Buy low, sell high. Don‚Äôt bend to peer pressure. Don‚Äôt buy because everyone else is (you‚Äôre probably late) or hold because everyone says you‚Äôll be paper handed if you sell (you‚Äôll probably be late). Make some  rules based on research and stick with them. I‚Äôm gonna buy if it hits $20, sell 25% if it hits $40, and sell the other 75% if it hits $80.‚Äù If that‚Äôs your plan, and you don‚Äôt get any new information other than what you read in WSB, stick to the plan.

Hope that helps. Open to other people eviscerating my crappy advice.",Strongest-There-Is,-1,/r/stocks/comments/lwdb53/cost_is_costco_currently_a_good_buy/gpgqjex/,0.048,0.817,0.135,0.9869

In the electric vehicle / automation space, there are clear plays that are often discussed here like Tesla and NIO.  What are the transformative plays in existing automakers (e.g. Ford, Honda)?

Question 2:

Plug-in electric vehicles seem to require a place to plug them in.  This would imply an advantage to home ownership vs renting (a non-single family home).  It seems that despite a prolonged period of historically low interest rates, home ownership rates have dropped compared to prior generations (i.e. rate of 38 year olds Millennials owning a home vs. Boomers at 38).  This can potentially be exacerbated with potentially rising interest rates.  So to what extent will reduced home ownership rates be a drag on plug-in electric vehicle adoption?",Optimistic-Cranberry,2,/r/stocks/comments/lwqqa2/rstocks_daily_thread_on_meme_stocks_wednesday_mar/gpkh5hx/,0.031,0.836,0.134,0.9092

851,NIO," I want to raise a small point about the Chinese culture. So many DDs here talk about how China's expanding middle class will have more disposable income to buy luxury EVs. If you talked to some people in the Chinese circle, you'll quickly find out that the main hype is for Tesla and European luxury cars like Mercedes, and BMW. Yes, there is a subset of the Chinese population who are into NIO and XPeng but the overall tone is that foreign luxury vehicles are viewed at a higher status. Not to mention the EV industry has a small profit margin and there is nothing stopping automakers from competing against each other when Mercedes, BMW, Toyota, etc. start unveiling their own electric vehicles. I am long on NIO and I do thing they have a great future but a market cap of $90 billion at their peak puts them as the 3rd largest automaker in the world. They are just not there yet.",StarryNight321,5,/r/stocks/comments/lx0j6b/what_is_going_on_with_chinese_ev_sector/gpkn4xh/,0.0,0.903,0.097,0.9315
852,IMO," All the auto stocks are suffering from the chip shortage and it's impacted the Chinese auto companies as well. The chip shortage has especially impacted the stocks of quickly-growing Chinese EV companies. How are they going to double/triple/quadruple their production when well-established companies like Ford have to cut output because of chips? Investors are pulling out until this chip situation is resolved (including myself).

By trying to use semiconductor chips in the trade war against China, the US has created a great rift in the global supply chain for chips. There have to be 2 supply chains now, US-oriented and China-oriented and right now neither supply chain is able to survive and maintain production without the other. So there's a crash in chip supplies for both the US (we're already been hearing a lot about that) and probably for Chinese companies (we haven't been hearing from them yet). 

The uncertainty in the chip supply chain has been enough to kill Chinese EV stocks in the near term. If you're going to wait for a bounce, a sense of direction as to where the semiconductor chip trade war will go, may be what puts a floor under the bottom. In the meantime, any small, fast-growing car company has to compete with the likes of Ford for new auto chips, and they may or may not have the resources to last out this trade war disruption in chip supply chains. The uncertainty is crushing their outlook with institutional investors, tho.

We see the far-reaching effects of the trade war's disruption of chip supply chains in the market selloffs of the past 2 weeks, as they are led not only by overvalued tech companies like Zoom, but, for the first time, chip maker stocks. This trade war is the biggest thing behind the tanking of tech stocks (other than the rotation out of 2020 pandemic stocks to industrials and commodities). 

At first there was a huge relief rally based on Trump being out of office because his trade war was disrupting businesses on all continents, especially the last 6 months of his term where he started this trade war embargo on Chinese semiconductor companies. But now it looks as if Biden will go in the same direction as Trump, and so part of the Biden relief rally that depends on chips (which includes a lot of tech stocks and the ETFs/indexes they are part of) is going away. So IMO tech will continue to shit the bed along with fast-growing auto startups and anyone else dependent on a reliable semiconductor supply chain.

900,ICE," For the price of clean energy stuff to go up, you just need a greater fool, and those are in abundance. I like to gauge sentiment of the ""apes"" by looking at the top stocks traded on fidelity. 

  [Top Fidelity](https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/gotoBL/fidelityTopOrders.jhtml)  

You see all kinds of trash companies on there, and at the moment there are at least 5 EV or clean energy plays in this list. Many are junk companies that will go away.

If you look at Tesla, the hardest part has been manufacturing, and they still really aren't profitable on the actual cars. And if you look at the new mail truck, they talk about it being electric or not about ""a choice of propulsion"" and it's really not something that defines the vehicle. 

So much of the clean energy space is problematic because the problems they are trying to solve are hard problems and the laws of science aren't that generous sometimes. Look at the history and challenges of Hydrogen, it was not practical a decade ago and I'm pretty sure it's not practical now, it's too inefficient at scale. 

I've heard people say that people will buy EV's because it's the right thing to do. Yes, some people will, but they will only succeed in a big way if they are better at what they do an ICE vehicles.

908,AI," You said it yourself: Their real value is based on long term prospects. Short term value is much harder to predict, and therefore the answer to your question ""what can I expect for the short term future"", can ultimately only be an attempt at predicting the market, which you probably know is infamously difficult. 

I'm not awfully experienced myself, but I suggest reading some general market analysis by financial institutions, and use that to try and generally predict the market over the coming period (couple of months/years). Then combine that with your own perspective on what the companies are actually worth, and the general investment populations ability to see the same that you see. 

Personally, primarily inspired by an financial prospects report by my bank, I believe the market is a bit inflated from a ton of stimulus over the past year. I think it's going to inflate a bit more, over the coming months, and I also don't believe a bubble burst is imminent. I think there is a chance that growth continues at a moderate pace post-corona. Possibly there is going to be a shift in the distribution of the economy, but it's hard to predict exactly how. I think a lot of high-profile companies, especially in the technology/innovation sector, have been significantly overvalued, and we can see adjustments have been happening. For example TSLA and CRSP. I personally think TSLA might go a bit lower (25% max) and CRSP slightly less so (15% max), but with very low confidence in both guesses. 

I think there is a great opportunity to look for competitors to hyped companies pushing exciting new technologies. I'm very eager to invest into the space sector, (2-10 years for great gains I think), electricity storage/transportation, and novel medical areas (like CRSP). I also think there is great potential for tech startups focusing on AI, but it's hard to find something good that has offered an IPO before they are aquired. 

Other than that, I think an emerging market, is 'human use' robotics (aka. robots that work closely with humans), and looking for larger companies that seem willing to integrate this into their business structure (like Huyndai aquiring Boston Dynamics), could be a good indicator for moderate long term growth. 

I would say there is a small risk that the technology sector as a whole is a bit overvalued during corona, but it's not something that I'm so sure of that it would make me stop investing into companies in that sector.

I hope that can give you some inspiration :) I really don't have any expertise in investing per se tho, so take it with a grain of salt. Warren Buffet (and a lot of other investment 'gurus') point out that the best way to invest (aside from passive investing), is to focus on the areas that you know something about.

I'm passive about tech, especially the things I mentioned above, so that's the type of companies I focus on, even if the market might favor growth in other sectors a bit higher in the coming future.

I believe the key here is mostly to know yourself, make a plan when you are clear minded amd stick to it when your head is clouded.

Another thing you might want to consider as part of this discussion, is that the timeframe for the individual is 30-70 years while for a fund manager, CEO or politician its typically much shorter.

917,CSV," When I was shopping around for ETFs, I compared all the major ones, and SPY is probably the one that had the highest 10 year return. This was just comparing different index ETFs.

You can try this yourself, it's super easy. Yahoo Finance charts let you easily compare multiple tickers on the same chart and then you can zoom out to 10 years and see which one had the highest return. Of course that doesnt guarantee it will continue like that in the future.

If I had to guess, although I'm not 100% sure, the reason SPY rose the most is because of its general popularity and it's low expense ratio which lets it track the S&P 500 more accurately. Although don't take my word for it I'm just guessing.

You can also look at low-beta/low-volatility ETFs such as SPLV or USMV. Those fluctuate less and over time make less return than others but they are ""safer"" due to less fluctuations. One way of comparing performance of ETFs is the Sharpe Ratio which is the ratio of the ETFs return to its standard deviation in price. Standard deviation in price is used as a proxy for risk in this case so the ratio acts as the ratio of return to risk. Obviously youd want to maximize return for the lowest amount of risk. Low beta/low volatility ETFs such as USMV and SPLV have some of the highest Sharpe Ratios that I've calculated when shopping around. You can perform the calculation in an Excel spreadsheet as well. Just get the historical price data from yahoo finance for an ETF, download as a CSV file, then calculate the return and use the standard deviation function over the historical prices. Then calculate the Sharpe Ratio and compare them.

Ultimately, what you pick depends on your own risk tolerance and investing timeframe.",er2z,2,/r/stocks/comments/lwncx9/advice_for_new_traders_on_what_to_expect_from/gpjdc8f/,0.064,0.872,0.064,-0.0647
918,DD," That's fair to say, over 30 or 50 years.

But if its hyper profitable for 5-10 and I *THEN* invest into high yeild dividend stocks and continue to make gains on my passive money, I'm way better off then I was on my low salary to begin with.

Furthermore, there is a difference between what I'm saying and your getting at.

Let's say I trade $200 and make $100, which is what I've done so far. I then take $75 of that and reinvest and slowly bring it up to $150 (completely doable) and then I trade on the $75 profit. What I've done is made $100 off my initial cash I used and it's never being used again, and I'm still trading on $75. It doesn't matter if I take losses on that $75 because I'm already up $100. (Make those numbers smaller or larger given your budget, round numbers are just easier.)

Of course I don't want to take any losses, but inevitably will at times, but I also haven't taken huge losses (cash wise) and most stocks rebound over a month to 3 months or so if you check their graphs.

So even if you only make and extra $7.50, you just play with that and the $67.50 prior.

You constantly do this and you slowly and vigilantly stack cash until you can afford to buy high yeild dividend stocks on companies with good to reasonable fundamentals.

I don't have the time to wait 30 years man. The vast majority of the population doesn't.

If you're tenacious, dedicated and vigilant enough with your math and follow trends, you can make some good plays.

For example, I've been averaging down almost daily, but the second I decide that I'd rather have more cash, I just sell what I'm overleveraged in. I honestly am down to like 1% cash (insanity), but there's no doubt in my mind that will be at least 10% by Friday, even if stocks continue to go down-- I need some capital to maneuver with and can hopefully sell things that went sideways instead of down.

TBH I think it's WAY worse to be overleveraged than to just sell 10-20% at a loss. If you're wrong and it crashes you lost WAY more than that, and you knew that you had more risk than you wanted. The only thing that's stopping you from going back to your original strategy and risk tolerance is what exactly, the fact that selling for a loss is counterproductive to averaging down?

I guess in your specific scenario, if I think there's a good chance AAPL/the market hasn't hit the bottom yet, I'd trim my AAPL position and expect to have more cash to avg down with starting tomorrow. Worst case scenario, I was wrong, that was the bottom, and you lost some gains... but remember I was actively trying to decrease risk, so I think that's 100% worth it imo.

Can someone tell me why I'm wrong? Thanks guys and good luck all",trawlinimnottrawlin,3,/r/stocks/comments/lx2oew/anyone_realize_they_effed_up_buying_too_many/gpkweu2/,0.154,0.685,0.161,-0.2126

/r/markmywords Fair value for TSLA is in the $200-300 range, and it will settle somewhere near there eventually. 

T Rowe Price dumped most of their Tesla stock a few years ago; people said they were nuts at the time but they've been around since the 1930s and have some very good fund managers ... with hindsight it looks as if they've dodged a bullet. 

Tesla make less than 1% of all vehicles globally but are somehow supposedly worth more than all other carmakers combined. Tata Motors from India has more gross revenue than Tesla. Last year, Berkshire Hathaway had enough cash to buy Tesla outright, but now Tesla is supposedly more valuable than Berkshire even though Berkshire has 10x the revenue. 

This is all insanity. Elon has said several times that Tesla's stock is overvalued.

 Investing Guidance: A Gate to walk through before making a trade. 

* What is the investment thesis?    The why.  Write it down. 
* Is the original thesis still true? 
* Are we a period of irrational exuberance or fear? 
* Are you speculating or investing?   Either is okay, just be clear what you're doing. 
* What is time scale of this investment?   Write this down so you remember when you want to sell/buy. 
* How much should you expose to this?   All at once or ease in over several trading days, weeks, months. 
* What are the best players in this investment class.  Eg, what competitors, other parties exist in this trade?  Who is the best?  Second best?   Why? 
* Is there a dividend or potential for one? What is the outlook for dividend growth? 
* What are potential big events that could influence the share price? Write them down. 
* Is this a REALLY good idea or just kind of ""meh, i need to put this money to work somewhere""
* Is this something stupid? 
* Are other large investors, family office, Buffet-like firms making a similar move?   
* Could you make this trade later after new information comes to light, the market digests what is going on, etc. 
* Will future events that generate more certainty buoy or depress the market?  Remember, the market LOVES certainty as much as positive or negative news. 
* What are insiders doing?  Buying, selling, holding, etc?",Grand_Routine_6532,7,/r/stocks/comments/lwuymw/is_there_a_checklist_you_follow_before_choosing/gpjbtge/,0.071,0.723,0.206,0.9933
958,FCF," I actually started using a checklist not too long ago and I've found it very helpful.  I update/revise it periodically as I learn new things.

First step is to differentiate between value and growth stocks because you'll look for slightly different things in each case.  For example, a decent dividend yield is important for value stocks but not for growth stocks.  Another example is that revenue growth is far more important for growth stocks, while EPS growth is more important for value stocks.

Here are some other things I look for when I invest:

* Low debt, or at least sufficient cash to cover their debt.  The current ratio is a good one for this.
* Positive and preferably growing operational cash flow
* High gross profit margins
* Growth in operating income
* If not profitable, heading in that direction
* Good valuation (I'll compare it to some of its competitors on metrics like P/S or P/E and P/FCF, and also on the basis of market cap)",SirGasleak,2,/r/stocks/comments/lwuymw/is_there_a_checklist_you_follow_before_choosing/gpjjj8u/,0.082,0.647,0.271,0.9872

In fact AMZN didn't again hit a $100/sh until 2010, so they lost money for 11 years if they were foolish enough to hold that long but 99% sold in the single digits or teens.

If this amount of options didn't matter then the price movement in the last few days/weeks wouldn't have been as sever as it has been. $12 and $12.5 call options were the main driving force of price movement upwards IMO.

1021,TSLA," Let me see if I can help you understand what is going on here.  I think there might be some misunderstanding.   If you understand this already and I misunderstood, I apologize in advance.

When you buy a stock, unless it pays dividends, there really won't be anything to reinvest.   All you can do is buy and sell the stock which will go up and down in value (hopefully more up than down).    

If you had bought 1 share of a company a couple of years ago, and it went up in value by 20%, you'd still have 1 share of the company, and that one share would be worth 20% more.    If you want to reinvest that money you have to sell that share which would turn it into cash, you'd get to pay taxes on the profit at a rate depending on how long you held it and how much money you have, so you'd actually have a bit less cash than you could then purchase something else with.  But at that point, you'd have zero shares of the company.

A few companies pay dividends - which basically takes some of the value of the stock and returns it to the shareholders.   For example, if you have a $100 stock and it pays a 1% dividend, then you would get $1 back (which you get to pay taxes on), and your stock will likely end up only being worth $99 afterward.   But you only have $1 to buy something else.

There are some exceptions to the above such as stock splits and if you have a lot of shares of something (which means you could sell \*part\* of your shares), but this description is good enough for basic information.

What is missing from your question is your goals.   If this is savings for retirement in your 60's then the recommendation I might suggest would be to just stash it in a Roth, most likely opened at Vanguard, and fund it with good-quality low-cost index or target-date funds, and keep adding to it until retirement age.   If this is your goal, you probably should hang out over at r/Bogleheads and read the sidebar material over there.   This sub has a lot of other good statistics-based strategy information.

If this is ""I want to learn about the stock market"" funds, then that's a whole different thing altogether, and I'm probably not the right person to ask since I'm more of a long-term investor.

I personally have a few individual stocks.  For instance, I bought the equivalent of 10 shares of TSLA a couple of years back for $711 total.  Those are now up over $7K and were much higher.  I'm holding them long-term.    I also have a couple of companies that I trust and respect and use their products.   But all of these are 'buy a handful of shares and keep them forever' type of purchases.   I'm not tied to them in any way so I can sell them if I become disillusioned with them for some reason but I'm generally not going to sell them to take profits to buy something else.   Note that I try to confine this to less than 1% of my portfolio but TSLA is making this difficult.

I should probably finish with some expectations setting:   On average the total stock market has only returned around 8.3% per year over the past 30 years.   It's been higher the last 10 years, more like 12%, but there is no guarantee that this will continue.   Just for simplicity let's say 10% is typical.   If you're keeping even with the market, your $4000 should end up being $4400 after a year.   Some years would be more, and some would be less as the 10% is an average, not a guarantee - so if you have a 15% year followed by a 5% year it's still 10% average.   

There are strategies people employ to try to beat the market but very few people succeed long-term.  Studies have shown that only 1 in 20 investors succeed in beating the market long-term.   The method to get around this is to buy something like VTI which follows the entire domestic market - which basically means that by definition, anything you put in VTI will earn exactly what the whole stockmarket does.   If you want some international VT has that in addition to the domestic.",Pass_Little,1,/r/stocks/comments/lwhvue/what_is_a_good_way_to_go_about_growing_your/gphnp0g/,0.033,0.867,0.1,0.9921

Imagine you were ""worth"" $10 billion and had $100 million in ""disposable"" cash you didn't want sitting in your savings account (b/c interest rates are near 0%), or didn't want it in bonds b/c yields are still pretty crappy.

Why not put 1% of your ""disposable"" cash into 100 different speculative educated guesses?  If a few of your educated guesses (in this case finding undervalued stocks and/or finding catalysts for options plays) pay out large at a 1000%+ magnitude?  You're easily net positive.  MAKE YOUR MONEY WORK FOR YOU.

Now in our cases...that $100 million ""disposable"" is a lot less.  Let's say, as in your post, $4k is the equivalent of the $100 million in this case.  Put $1k into ""blue chips"" and $2k cash to buy ""dips"" on them.  Spend the remaining $1k into things you believe that will grow, through your own DD, on a few speculative educated guesses.

In this scenario, let's say you put $1k into ""FANG"" stocks.  You have $2k in cash to buy dips, or make other plays when the opportunity presents itself.  Now, you have $1k remaining to split into a few educated guesses on stocks that are hyped and/or undervalued.

Imagine if you had put 30% of that $1k into an ""educated guess"" that RKT would blow up even YESTERDAY.

Imagine you were ""worth"" $10 billion and had $100 million in ""disposable"" cash you didn't want sitting in your savings account (b/c interest rates are near 0%), or didn't want it in bonds b/c yields are still pretty crappy.

Why not put 1% of your ""disposable"" cash into 100 different speculative educated guesses?  If a few of your educated guesses (in this case finding undervalued stocks and/or finding catalysts for options plays) pay out large at a 1000%+ magnitude?  You're easily net positive.  MAKE YOUR MONEY WORK FOR YOU.

Now in our cases...that $100 million ""disposable"" is a lot less.  Let's say, as in your post, $4k is the equivalent of the $100 million in this case.  Put $1k into ""blue chips"" and $2k cash to buy ""dips"" on them.  Spend the remaining $1k into things you believe that will grow, through your own DD, on a few speculative educated guesses.

In this scenario, let's say you put $1k into ""FANG"" stocks.  You have $2k in cash to buy dips, or make other plays when the opportunity presents itself.  Now, you have $1k remaining to split into a few educated guesses on stocks that are hyped and/or undervalued.

Imagine if you had put 30% of that $1k into an ""educated guess"" that RKT would blow up even YESTERDAY.  Let's say you bought a $25 call option for \~$300 YESTERDAY when it was trading at \~$24 when you found out about their special dividend and its ex-date.  That $300 would have been WAY MORE than your entire ""gambling"" pot.  Same difference...let's say you bought into DFV's DD and bought GME at even $20 for 10 shares.  If you meme'd it and sold them at $420.69, that play alone would be worth your entire starting stash.

Be safe, of course.  But...also gamble.  ""Scared money don't make no money"".

1033,GDP," I feel your frustration.  But I can't agree with your premise.  The day I became a stockbroker (now retired), the Dow closed at 1005.  That was a long time ago, almost 40 years.  I can't tell you how many times I heard the market is too high as it went through 2000,4000, 8000, 14,000, 25000, and recently 30,000.

The market is a forward looking animal.  It sees what we can't.  It isn't trading on what the trailing PE has been.  It's trading on what it sees earning of great companies WILL be in the future.

Thinking short term bonds will carry you any where is a mistake.  The TIPS bonds are at negative yields.  If rates go up, you will  lose not only principal but buying power.  There is not a pension plan in the whole country that would do what you are suggesting.  I would put it in cash before I bought any bonds.

Bonds have been in a bull market since 1982.  That 40 year downtrend may not be over, but the  bulk of any gains are behind us.

I see tons of QE in place, a $1.9 Trillion Covid package in the next couple of weeks.  That may be followed by a $3 Trillion infrastructure bill this year.

Covid is coming to an end.  People will be going back to work.  Some folks are calling for a 10% increase in GDP versus last year.

Cost of capital  is the lowest we have ever seen, at least in the last 100 years.  Companies will be able to grow with the lowest rates in multiple  lifetimes.

I have no dog in your hunt.  But I can't help myself.   Just buy SPY or the Vanguard version.  You won't have to agonize over individual stocks anymore.  You will own the 500 largest companies in the US.   Yeah, you could diversify with some QQQ , EFA, or EEM.  But the SPY will be enough. (I wish they would let Social Security do that.)

I don't usually recommend this, but you may be a good candidate for Betterment or even a managed account at Merrill or some other firm.  Yeah, it will cost more, but you will get hand holding and at least some expertise from the firm's asset allocation models. You could use a cheerleader about now.

Tesla is production constrained. Due to COVID and Model Y transition, they ended up shipping less inventory to Europe in 2020. They won't be launching the Model Y in Europe until the new factory comes online in Germany.

Again, Tesla is production constrained. The inventory left over from Q4 is mostly sold or is demo or used vehicles, especially in places like Europe.

So a first month of a quarter makes no sense to look at unit sales... pretty much everyone knows this but the idiot writing that article.

Trying to tease out a specific region for a specific point in time is the kind of cherry picking that got TSLAQ all screwed up.

DeFi - contingent on mainstream uptake from both businesses and consumers

telehealth - contingent on continual high growth after COVID

autonomous driving/delivery - contingent on favorable results and governmental regulations

5G/WiFi6/AR/IOT/Drones - contingent on infrastructure and hardware designs to support mid-band (1 GHZ - 6 GHZ) frequency spectrum--particularly, rf filters.

1060,AI," Tesla might be done but the EV market is thriving.  There's other options out there along with battery cell, autonomous driving, commercial EV solutions, and lithium stocks.  AI data analysis is becoming more and more crucial in most fields (even the NFL is using it on a play to play basis).  Aerospace and Defense as the dems begin racking up those invade for pay foreign policy contracts (DFEN is a good one that covers all).  Robotics, robotic surgery.  Implantable continuous data devices for medical purposes.  Chip manufacturing is way, way behind - there's a manufacturer out there that will grab that open market share and run with it, if you can find it.  If someone finds a new battery tech, expect big things.  We need more and more power and we need it mobile.  We just don't have enough right now.  And, data analysis is capped due to nano chip tech, it's found its limits with our current technology and we need a way to make transistors smaller and cheaper.  Whoever finds that will make a lot of money.

10X stocks come from new tech and you have to get in early.  It's high risk and you usually lose a few.  And, typically the older people are the more disconnected from new technologies they are (and thus how important they perceive new technology).  So you'll notice young investors hit those weird ones first (I like to track newer hedge funds for that).

I ended up getting back into NIO after NIO Day because their news of autonomous driving partnernship with NVIDIA, battery tech commitments and expansion appealed to me.

After NIO popped 7% after NIO day I chased in out of emotional action which was very reckless. I'm well aware, I should have sold CSPs instead of just buying stock outright. But here I am.

I wasn't a believer in NIO when I sold in December, but since then I really like what they're doing. Firstly, they're a non-US play which helps diversify my portfolio. Secondly, I like their holistic strategy, and expansion into Europe. I think their battery swap stations are well designed for European population and road density.

But and I think you're right, averaging down is the best course of action. Maybe I'll do a combination of selling CC's and then using the gains to average down.

1104,GME," If you got flagged during the first GME runup, you're fine. It's 5 day-trades in 5 days that are the max you can do. After those 5 days, it resets and you can do 5 more.


Also, 1 call = 100 shares, NOT 100 contracts. Just want to make sure that's clear since buying 100 shares is a lot different than buy 100 contracts (10,000 shares).


You are buying a call. You can do something called selling a covered call, but you need to own 100 shares to sell 1 call, since if the person chooses to exercise the contract, which means buy 100 shares at the strike price, you lose your shares, but keep the contract premium. Selling calls/puts can be a worthwhile strategy but I recommend waiting until you understand buying calls and puts before you start getting into selling them. Dont overwhelm yourself.


I think you have the basic idea but remember, that $11 call contract premium is going to be more than $0.58 when market opens since this stock did go up during AH. Just a guess but I bet the contract will be $1.00, which also increases your break even price.


If you do buy a call tomorrow and it's goes up in value, I'd consider selling it for a profit. I've gotten greedy and waited days to sell a contract that was worth $$$ only to watch it expire worthless and I lost 100% of my initial investment aka the contract premium.


Finally, you are obviously new to options, which is fine, I am relatively new as well. They are actually pretty simple to understand but I strongly recommend NOT doing your first options play with a high violate stock tomorrow. You might make some money, and the risk isn't outrageous but I'd recommend looking into a different stock and trying a few call options there.

1)Trading can be stress free and fun, even when losses occur. If you are scalping or day trading I might suggest you look at swing trading. Time is your friend in this form of trading; time to research the stock, analyze indicators, see what your partners in crime (not a literal statement LOL) here on reddit are thinking about that stock. Still no guarantees but work on the stress first, then you'll be able to focus your energy on learning and improving. In short, your method of trading should a.) be easy to understand b.) easy to execute both mentally and on your current trading platform c.) fits your lifestyle in such a way that your not hyper focused at the expense of other things that are important to you d.) You do not trade beyond what you are willing to lose, with no stress when it happens (and it will).

2) Everyone goes down for the count at one time or another. 50%?  yes, it is possible due to a mix of trader choices, actions or lack of, and external factors. More than one reddit poster has opened up about losses over the last month. Your not unique, is the moral of the story.

3) Even great stocks are mutted or decline due to overall market movements. I have a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/50YrPlusInvestors/comments/lwzfmy/two_index_charts_essential_to_successful_trading/) on a community I created, the subject of index charts all traders should look at before entering a trade. It might keep you out of future trading trouble.

4) I would avoid the dog and pony Youtube traders who flash their daily gains. Find a person or persons who focus on the hows and whys and don't flout their gains. Ask a ton of questions here on reddit, there are a lot who are willing to help you on your learning path. Me included.

5) In addition to looking at and possibly changing up your trading method, step away for a couple days with the intent of doing a mental reset, and return not with disappointment or frustration but resolve to conquer trading. I am about the dullest shovel in the garden shed and I am generating income from swing trading. Started slow and low ($), reverse engineered every bad trade, reduced my emotional trading (will never eliminate it), and stayed away from the huge plays until I felt I had the skills to play at that table.

...1000) Never trade on another persons choice suggestion of stock. You can consider what they are saying but make certain YOU like it and feel good about the setup.

Feel free to stop by the [community](https://www.reddit.com/r/50YrPlusInvestors/) I started and MOD, and ask questions at any time.

1143,GE," > it's clear that I would have more than doubled my money if I had stayed in $GE. My question is: what lesson can I take from this?

Learn to stop worrying and love trend going in right direction, honestly looking at GE chart I don't see anything that should make you wanting to leave a ship, growth was nice and it wasn't crazy 50% in a day but stable, solid growth starting in October, nothing to worry for person with bullish approach to this stock.",Szudar,2,/r/stocks/comments/lx1zpt/what_to_do_if_my_thesis_is_wrong_but_direction_is/gpkkl79/,0.048,0.72,0.232,0.9304
1144,GE," Unless you strongly felt GE was experiencing a pump and dump, which no chart indicates is the case, and it is a company with about eleventy-bazillion shares and a $120 billion market cap so it is basically impossible... I am some what flabbergasted as to why you would run away from stronger than expected gains?

What were you scared of? if it was a pump and dump type drop off a cliff you were scared off, that is what stop losses are for... but again, the trend in no way indicates this and you can't really do that sort of thing with a company that has trading volumes up around 75 million... 

I think your take way is a deep breath and recognizing stock signals. GE is up \~28% YTD. good growth. maybe even fast growth. Explosive? unsustainable? volatile? None of those words could apply here. GE has experienced nice steady growth over the past couple month, one that SHOULD of been a happy surprise to watch. 

\+20% in a month is not a shocking development, even for an old school, sideways trading company like GE.

1152,ABC," jesus christ dont buy an option yet

ITM- lower upside, higher premium due to higher chance of it being successful

OTM- higher upside, lower premium due to high chance of expiring worthless

theta is absolutely not the same. let's take ABC at 100. The 100 option will decay at a lower rate relative to its premium vs the 110 call if both are expiring on friday. Why? With each day, the 110 has a dramatically lower chance to expire ITM.

IV- yes preferably you would want a call with low iv but that's more along the lines of picking a ticker

OTM reacts dramatically to large price actions. Let's take ABC again at 100. If for the week, ABC trades at +1/-1% but then on friday, it magically skyrockets to 120, that OTM which was probably 0.01 will skyrocket like crazy and much higher relative to that 100 call due to delta movement and an injection of IV.",thelastsubject123,2,/r/stocks/comments/lwxtv1/options_calls_itm_vs_otm/gpjttyc/,0.089,0.832,0.079,-0.1779

**ETFS that I like (Outside of the tech sector)**

**IBUY -**  **AMPLIFY ONLINE RETAIL ETF -**  This is a ""sector fund"" that seeks investment results that generally correspond (before fees and expenses) to the price and yield of the EQM Online Retail Index. The fund will invest at least 80% of its total assets in global equity securities that comprise the index, which will primarily include common stocks and/or depositary receipts, such as ADRs and GDRs. The index seeks to measure the performance of global equity securities of publicly traded companies with significant revenue from the online retail business. The index methodology is designed to result in a portfolio that has the potential for capital appreciation.  It has a phenomenal 168% 52-week return. The fund invests in mostly small-cap and mid-cap companies, so little-to-no overlap with VOO. It specifically targets companies with growth potential.

**IWM -**   The investment seeks to track the investment results of the Russell 2000 Index, which measures the performance of the small-capitalization sector of the U.S. equity market. The fund generally invests at least 90% of its assets in securities of the underlying index and in depositary receipts representing securities of the underlying index. It may invest the remainder of its assets in certain futures, options and swap contracts, cash and cash equivalents, as well as in securities not included in the underlying index, but which the advisor believes will help the fund track the underlying index. The fund has a 46.8% 52 week return on investment.  No overlap with VOO. It does have some Renewable Energy companies, but it is a fairly broad market ETF (in that it covers many sectors).

**QQQM** \- This is a NASDAQ 100 ETF and will overlap quite a bit with VOO. However, the NASDAQ 100 index outperforms the S&P 500 index most quarter, and has a 10 year return that is more than double that of the S&P 500 index.  However, QQQM is tech-heavy. It is considered a ""broad market"" fund in that it doesn't target a specific sector. However, the stocks in the NASDAQ 100 are mostly tech or tech-related stocks. 

**EFA** \- If you want global exposure, EFA is a great ETF to own. The ETF tracks the investment results of the MSCI EAFE Index composed of large- and mid-capitalization developed market equities, excluding the U.S. and Canada. You'll find a lot of established companies from Europe and Japan in this ETF. It includes companies like Nestle, Roche, Toyota, Unilever, AstraZeneca, and other companies that you have heard of.  Think of this ETF as sort of a ""S&P 500 ETF for companies outside of the US and Canada.""  Its 52 week return isn't particularly impressive at 19.5%, but it should provide a solid return and will give your portfolio quite a lot of diversity.  There will be no overlap between this one and VOO, and very little tech in this one.

**XAR:  SPDR S&P AEROSPACE & DEFENSE ETF** \- This ETF seeks to provide investment results that, before fees and expenses, correspond generally to the total return performance of the S&P Aerospace & Defense Select Industry Index. Top holdings include Virgin Galactic (5.32%), General Dynamics, Northrop, Textron and others. The 52 week return for this one is 18.6%. 

**VDC: Vanguard's Consumer Staples Index Fund** \-  This ETF will track the performance of the MSCI US Investable Market Index/Consumer Staples 25/50, an index made up of stocks of large, mid-size, and small U.S. companies within the consumer staples sector, as classified under the Global Industry Classification Standard. The Advisor attempts to replicate the target index by seeking to invest all, or substantially all, of its assets in the stocks that make up the index, in order to hold each stock in approximately the same proportion as its weighting in the index. Top holdings include: Proctor & Gamble, Walmart, Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Phillip-Morris, Costco, Mondelez and Colgate-Palmolive. The 52 week return is 7.9%. You will see some overlap between this one and VOO. This is a fund that won't provide much growth in your portfolio, but should reduce volatility and will also provide a 2.6% dividend yield. 

**VDE - Vanguard Energy Index** \- If you want to invest in oil, this might be the way to go.  This ETF has all of the major oil companies. Top holdings include: Exxon-Mobile (21.8%), Chevron (18.97%), Conoco-Phillips (5.38%), Phillips 66 (3.44%), EOG Resources (3.41%), Schlumberger (3.4%), Kinder Morgan (3.3%), Marathon Petroleum (3.27%), and Williams Companies (2.97%). The 52-week performance is only 8.38%, but will oil prices on the rise, this one is likely to have a much better return in 2021.

You'll find a lot of established companies from Europe and Japan in this ETF. It includes companies like Nestle, Roche, Toyota, Unilever, AstraZeneca, and other companies that you have heard of.  Think of this ETF as sort of a ""S&P 500 ETF for companies outside of the US and Canada.""  Its 52 week return isn't particularly impressive at 19.5%, but it should provide a solid return and will give your portfolio quite a lot of diversity.  There will be no overlap between this one and VOO, and very little tech in this one.

**XAR:  SPDR S&P AEROSPACE & DEFENSE ETF** \- This ETF seeks to provide investment results that, before fees and expenses, correspond generally to the total return performance of the S&P Aerospace & Defense Select Industry Index. Top holdings include Virgin Galactic (5.32%), General Dynamics, Northrop, Textron and others. The 52 week return for this one is 18.6%. 

**VDC: Vanguard's Consumer Staples Index Fund** \-  This ETF will track the performance of the MSCI US Investable Market Index/Consumer Staples 25/50, an index made up of stocks of large, mid-size, and small U.S. companies within the consumer staples sector, as classified under the Global Industry Classification Standard. The Advisor attempts to replicate the target index by seeking to invest all, or substantially all, of its assets in the stocks that make up the index, in order to hold each stock in approximately the same proportion as its weighting in the index. Top holdings include: Proctor & Gamble, Walmart, Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Phillip-Morris, Costco, Mondelez and Colgate-Palmolive. The 52 week return is 7.9%. You will see some overlap between this one and VOO. This is a fund that won't provide much growth in your portfolio, but should reduce volatility and will also provide a 2.6% dividend yield. 

**VDE - Vanguard Energy Index** \- If you want to invest in oil, this might be the way to go.  This ETF has all of the major oil companies. Top holdings include: Exxon-Mobile (21.8%), Chevron (18.97%), Conoco-Phillips (5.38%), Phillips 66 (3.44%), EOG Resources (3.41%), Schlumberger (3.4%), Kinder Morgan (3.3%), Marathon Petroleum (3.27%), and Williams Companies (2.97%).

**IBUY -**  **AMPLIFY ONLINE RETAIL ETF -**  This is a ""sector fund"" that seeks investment results that generally correspond (before fees and expenses) to the price and yield of the EQM Online Retail Index. The fund will invest at least 80% of its total assets in global equity securities that comprise the index, which will primarily include common stocks and/or depositary receipts, such as ADRs and GDRs. The index seeks to measure the performance of global equity securities of publicly traded companies with significant revenue from the online retail business. The index methodology is designed to result in a portfolio that has the potential for capital appreciation.  It has a phenomenal 168% 52-week return. The fund invests in mostly small-cap and mid-cap companies, so little-to-no overlap with VOO. It specifically targets companies with growth potential.

**IWM -**   The investment seeks to track the investment results of the Russell 2000 Index, which measures the performance of the small-capitalization sector of the U.S. equity market. The fund generally invests at least 90% of its assets in securities of the underlying index and in depositary receipts representing securities of the underlying index. It may invest the remainder of its assets in certain futures, options and swap contracts, cash and cash equivalents, as well as in securities not included in the underlying index, but which the advisor believes will help the fund track the underlying index.

However, the NASDAQ 100 index outperforms the S&P 500 index most quarter, and has a 10 year return that is more than double that of the S&P 500 index.  However, QQQM is tech-heavy. It is considered a ""broad market"" fund in that it doesn't target a specific sector. However, the stocks in the NASDAQ 100 are mostly tech or tech-related stocks.

**ETFS that I like (Outside of the tech sector)**

**IBUY -**  **AMPLIFY ONLINE RETAIL ETF -**  This is a ""sector fund"" that seeks investment results that generally correspond (before fees and expenses) to the price and yield of the EQM Online Retail Index. The fund will invest at least 80% of its total assets in global equity securities that comprise the index, which will primarily include common stocks and/or depositary receipts, such as ADRs and GDRs. The index seeks to measure the performance of global equity securities of publicly traded companies with significant revenue from the online retail business. The index methodology is designed to result in a portfolio that has the potential for capital appreciation.  It has a phenomenal 168% 52-week return. The fund invests in mostly small-cap and mid-cap companies, so little-to-no overlap with VOO. It specifically targets companies with growth potential.

**IWM -**   The investment seeks to track the investment results of the Russell 2000 Index, which measures the performance of the small-capitalization sector of the U.S. equity market. The fund generally invests at least 90% of its assets in securities of the underlying index and in depositary receipts representing securities of the underlying index. It may invest the remainder of its assets in certain futures, options and swap contracts, cash and cash equivalents, as well as in securities not included in the underlying index, but which the advisor believes will help the fund track the underlying index. The fund has a 46.8% 52 week return on investment.  No overlap with VOO. It does have some Renewable Energy companies, but it is a fairly broad market ETF (in that it covers many sectors).

**QQQM** \- This is a NASDAQ 100 ETF and will overlap quite a bit with VOO. However, the NASDAQ 100 index outperforms the S&P 500 index most quarter, and has a 10 year return that is more than double that of the S&P 500 index.  However, QQQM is tech-heavy. It is considered a ""broad market"" fund in that it doesn't target a specific sector. However, the stocks in the NASDAQ 100 are mostly tech or tech-related stocks. 

**EFA** \- If you want global exposure, EFA is a great ETF to own. The ETF tracks the investment results of the MSCI EAFE Index composed of large- and mid-capitalization developed market equities, excluding the U.S. and Canada. You'll find a lot of established companies from Europe and Japan in this ETF. It includes companies like Nestle, Roche, Toyota, Unilever, AstraZeneca, and other companies that you have heard of.  Think of this ETF as sort of a ""S&P 500 ETF for companies outside of the US and Canada.""  Its 52 week return isn't particularly impressive at 19.5%, but it should provide a solid return and will give your portfolio quite a lot of diversity.  There will be no overlap between this one and VOO, and very little tech in this one.

**XAR:  SPDR S&P AEROSPACE & DEFENSE ETF** \- This ETF seeks to provide investment results that, before fees and expenses, correspond generally to the total return performance of the S&P Aerospace & Defense Select Industry Index. Top holdings include Virgin Galactic (5.32%), General Dynamics, Northrop, Textron and others. The 52 week return for this one is 18.6%. 

**VDC: Vanguard's Consumer Staples Index Fund** \-  This ETF will track the performance of the MSCI US Investable Market Index/Consumer Staples 25/50, an index made up of stocks of large, mid-size, and small U.S. companies within the consumer staples sector, as classified under the Global Industry Classification Standard. The Advisor attempts to replicate the target index by seeking to invest all, or substantially all, of its assets in the stocks that make up the index, in order to hold each stock in approximately the same proportion as its weighting in the index. Top holdings include: Proctor & Gamble, Walmart, Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Phillip-Morris, Costco, Mondelez and Colgate-Palmolive. The 52 week return is 7.9%. You will see some overlap between this one and VOO. This is a fund that won't provide much growth in your portfolio, but should reduce volatility and will also provide a 2.6% dividend yield. 

**VDE - Vanguard Energy Index** \- If you want to invest in oil, this might be the way to go.  This ETF has all of the major oil companies. Top holdings include: Exxon-Mobile (21.8%), Chevron (18.97%), Conoco-Phillips (5.38%), Phillips 66 (3.44%), EOG Resources (3.41%), Schlumberger (3.4%), Kinder Morgan (3.3%), Marathon Petroleum (3.27%), and Williams Companies (2.97%).

It may invest the remainder of its assets in certain futures, options and swap contracts, cash and cash equivalents, as well as in securities not included in the underlying index, but which the advisor believes will help the fund track the underlying index. The fund has a 46.8% 52 week return on investment.  No overlap with VOO. It does have some Renewable Energy companies, but it is a fairly broad market ETF (in that it covers many sectors).

**QQQM** \- This is a NASDAQ 100 ETF and will overlap quite a bit with VOO. However, the NASDAQ 100 index outperforms the S&P 500 index most quarter, and has a 10 year return that is more than double that of the S&P 500 index.  However, QQQM is tech-heavy. It is considered a ""broad market"" fund in that it doesn't target a specific sector. However, the stocks in the NASDAQ 100 are mostly tech or tech-related stocks. 

**EFA** \- If you want global exposure, EFA is a great ETF to own. The ETF tracks the investment results of the MSCI EAFE Index composed of large- and mid-capitalization developed market equities, excluding the U.S. and Canada. You'll find a lot of established companies from Europe and Japan in this ETF. It includes companies like Nestle, Roche, Toyota, Unilever, AstraZeneca, and other companies that you have heard of.  Think of this ETF as sort of a ""S&P 500 ETF for companies outside of the US and Canada.""  Its 52 week return isn't particularly impressive at 19.5%, but it should provide a solid return and will give your portfolio quite a lot of diversity.  There will be no overlap between this one and VOO, and very little tech in this one.

**XAR:  SPDR S&P AEROSPACE & DEFENSE ETF** \- This ETF seeks to provide investment results that, before fees and expenses, correspond generally to the total return performance of the S&P Aerospace & Defense Select Industry Index. Top holdings include Virgin Galactic (5.32%), General Dynamics, Northrop, Textron and others. The 52 week return for this one is 18.6%. 

**VDC: Vanguard's Consumer Staples Index Fund** \-  This ETF will track the performance of the MSCI US Investable Market Index/Consumer Staples 25/50, an index made up of stocks of large, mid-size, and small U.S. companies within the consumer staples sector, as classified under the Global Industry Classification Standard. The Advisor attempts to replicate the target index by seeking to invest all, or substantially all, of its assets in the stocks that make up the index, in order to hold each stock in approximately the same proportion as its weighting in the index. Top holdings include: Proctor & Gamble, Walmart, Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Phillip-Morris, Costco, Mondelez and Colgate-Palmolive. The 52 week return is 7.9%. You will see some overlap between this one and VOO. This is a fund that won't provide much growth in your portfolio, but should reduce volatility and will also provide a 2.6% dividend yield. 

**VDE - Vanguard Energy Index** \- If you want to invest in oil, this might be the way to go.  This ETF has all of the major oil companies. Top holdings include: Exxon-Mobile (21.8%), Chevron (18.97%), Conoco-Phillips (5.38%), Phillips 66 (3.44%), EOG Resources (3.41%), Schlumberger (3.4%), Kinder Morgan (3.3%), Marathon Petroleum (3.27%), and Williams Companies (2.97%). The 52-week performance is only 8.38%, but will oil prices on the rise, this one is likely to have a much better return in 2021.

**IBUY -**  **AMPLIFY ONLINE RETAIL ETF -**  This is a ""sector fund"" that seeks investment results that generally correspond (before fees and expenses) to the price and yield of the EQM Online Retail Index. The fund will invest at least 80% of its total assets in global equity securities that comprise the index, which will primarily include common stocks and/or depositary receipts, such as ADRs and GDRs. The index seeks to measure the performance of global equity securities of publicly traded companies with significant revenue from the online retail business. The index methodology is designed to result in a portfolio that has the potential for capital appreciation.  It has a phenomenal 168% 52-week return. The fund invests in mostly small-cap and mid-cap companies, so little-to-no overlap with VOO. It specifically targets companies with growth potential.
