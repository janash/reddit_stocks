Not that I really recommended RH for ages anyways, but apparently going forward it's Fidelity and Etrade when people ask I guess.

You're talking about the head of the Nasdaq saying that trading in situations like GME should be paused so that pros can ""recalibrate?"" When my investments toilet, can I get a trade halt? 

As others have noted, this basically confirms a lot of what WSB have been saying. 

Is this some attempt for firms to try to ""protect"" people? Some people will end up losing big in this whole thing and that's unfortunate, but even if so, can't start stopping trading (what's the rules-based exact reason why RH is not allowing trading in these names?) because once you do it it's a slippery slope - what becomes, ""too much, gotta stop trading""?

I tell people on here that you're going to make mistakes and you have to learn from your errors and over time you hopefully evolve into a better investor. Apparently, when major funds make real mistakes, they don't have to learn from their mistakes, they yell for the ref to halt the game. When this GME squeeze is over (and it will be at some point - it isn't going to infinity), some people are going to be the bagholders and that's unfortunate but my question is, when GME reverses and there's volatility to the downside, will the same brokerages halt trading in these names again or no?

Whether you are for what WSB did or not, I think everyone can agree that this ""rules for me but not for thee.""  And maybe that's the way things are going to be and people have to adapt, but it's still pretty dismaying.

If this somehow shows how broken the system is (i don't think it's going to cause some sort of market crash, it will stop sooner than later), then that was going to happen eventually anyways.

This morning I, and millions of other retail investors, were blocked from purchasing (entering new buy orders) on the Robinhood platform, without notice. This clear example of market manipulation has forced the stock down from over $500 in after-hours to less than $300 as of this writing. Meanwhile, hedge fund interests are NOT blocked from buying the shares being traded and the lower price obviously benefits them. 

We retail investors have followed all the rules and finally stood to gain a LITTLE bit from Wall St and they suddenly change the rules ""to protect"" us.

So today is all about psychological warfare. First they restricted people on RH and IB and others from trading then they orchestrated what seemed like a huge sell off.

If you look at the volume, this actually didn't happen though and was all just fake. To understand you need to know how they come up with the price in the chart. Basically if somebody sells a stock for $150 dollar, that's your new value in the chart. So basically what they do is, they sell at 300, then at 299, then 298, and so on. They take on a huge risk by doing this because of course they increase their short positions. They did this a lot in the last couple of days, but today they did it three times in a row pushing the price as low as $120. They were hoping that enough people on Reddit and IB would panic sell (because they're unexperienced) and then are unable to buy back once they realize it was all just for show.

Now the thing that saved the day is that at this point this is not just retail investors. At this point there is other institutional investors involved and of course they immediately saw through tnis, waited it out and now pushed the price right back above 200.

Why 200 you might ask. The highest call that was sold is 200. They're all in the money and some of them expire Friday. What will happen is that whoever sold them needs to buy 100 shares and give them to the call holder. So basically this will lead to very high demand at very limited supply. In fact higher demand than could ever possibly be supplied.

The real short squeeze hasn't happened. It happened today right before the big drop. I know now what it looks like. Straight up, no dips at all. It went up to 420.69, stayed there for a while (because many people set that as a sell price), then went straight to 444.44 (because people like this number too) and so on. They realized how screwed they are and pulled off their last strategy.

All day I said why isn't SEC stepping in, this is clear market manipulation, but I realize now why. This is even bigger than I thought. The broker is responsible for making sure their clients don't lose too much money, i.e. by margin calling them. Now Melvin capitals broker (who by the way owns 40% of robin hood, sees all their transactions and orders and of course was expected to influence them in this way) knows, that if they margin call melvin, they will not be able to cover the cost. So who will pay the rest? If I understand correctly it is the broker who has to pay the rest. I don't know who that broker is and how they're set up, but they will basically go bankrupt immediately and they might have a huge amount of funds in them suddenly being unable to pay out to their other clients. If this will happen, then a global market crash is almost guaranteed.

So the SEC isn't stepping in, because they don't want this short squeeze to happen. For decades, hedge funds pushed for very loose regulation. Now they've maneuvered themselves into a position of truly infinite loss. I mean at one point I'm very proud of reddit they figured out the loophole, but it's also scary.

I really don't know at this point, what will happen if the squeeze truly happens.

Given how this battle was fought so far, there's probably more dirty tactics coming.",0.106,0.807,0.087,-0.9124

Robinhood and several other brokerages have taken coordinated action to manipulate the volume on multiple stocks on the morning of January 28. They have specifically targeted stocks of the companies GameStop (GME), BlackBerry (BB), and AMC (AMC). They have removed the ability for their users to buy the stock and are only allowing their users to perform sell actions with regard to the security. Removing the ability to buy a stock while retaining only the ability to sell it with no explanation is not only manipulation of the stock on a technical level (if nobody can buy the price by definition cannot go up) but also on a psychological level as investors begin to panic sell as they see such strange actions being taken by their trusted brokers with no explanation aside from vague warnings of increased risk from market volatility.",0.116,0.796,0.088,-0.7009

The big institutional investors use specific language the average guy can’t understand, boiling it down to “buy” “hold” “to the moon” makes it understandable. It is my view that the stock market is a reflection, in normal conditions, of general confidence in a given company. What we have here, in my opinion, is people fighting back.

These are mostly kids who grew up seeing the 2008 collapse, seeing what the desperation and destitution that the speculative markets bring and fighting back. The institutional investors have had the run of things, people saw an opportunity to fight back, and fight back on nostalgia. I’m 28 myself, I remember lining up at GameStop for releases, trading in games for pennies on the dollar, talking about what games were coming out. So it’s sentimental to me.

People started buying the stock because GME was making progress forward, the hedge funds were disregarding that. We’re the hedge funds right to do so? Not my place to say, I’m a machinist by trade and at most a hobbyist investor. People took that nostalgia for their childhood, saw people betting against it, saw that company, perhaps, coming back to life, and had sufficient disposable income to fight back against rich suits.

Is it class war? I’d venture yes. The little guy is fighting back and the big guy is getting worn down. Make no mistake, hedge funds will continue to do similar things as what they’re doing with GME.",0.122,0.81,0.068,-0.9229

edit: and in terms of the implications of blocking options... i'm guessing they're more looking at the perspective of being able to close them out as the broker... sorta feels like they're gonna let the existing options and shares work themselves out, but new options was only going to make it messier to let everything work out so that was the stop... at least that's how I perceive their actions.

My entry into GME was fundamentals-based with the Chewy gang joining the board, the surprisingly resilient physical game market, console supercycle, and short-term bankruptcy off the table, etc. (gmedd.com is a good source of information some people have put together on this, though that was not the basis of my original trade).

VIX is rising because all this trading (look at the volumes today) and also because other hedge funds are buying puts to protect their investments so puts are more expensive and the VIX is directly related to how expensive are the options on the SPX.

So, this is really funny, but this crash has been trigerred by the brokers raising margin requirements and WSB and the GME squeeze that forced retail traders to close their positions to free capital to be able to to buy this heavily shorted stocks.

Anyone who has worked with machine learning before knows 99% of the time the algorithms work great. But on the odd occasion you'll find your classification model will do something weird like decide to label a human as an ape. That's because they all work on fairly shallow approximations of the world and if we struggle to build an image classification model which is complex enough to work 99% of the time, I don't know how Elon expects to have a FSD solution that can accurately recognize and understand how to respond to the huge array of different road signs, traffic junction, weather conditions, etc. What happens when the traffic lights are broken and the stop light stays red? What happens when the police try to pull over the car? What happens when a road is flooded? What happens when there are protestors in the road?

It's not going to happen. At best they will launch an advanced driver automation system which Elon will incorrectly label ""FSD"", but won't be ready for robotaxis.

420,AI,">car being a battery only workd if your car is at home in the day

I think this is one of my least speculative predictions here. The car as battery for house doesn't have to work in every situation, but it just need to work in enough situations to be adopted. For example:

* People who work from home.
* People who have second or third cars (think soccer moms/dads).
* Offices can also use this technology. So you park your car for 8 hours at work, it can send electricity back into the grid.

I think one issue I don't understand is how this will affect the life of the battery. If you are constantly charging and discharging, how long can your battery last? But I know this charging back into system technology is actively being worked on. In NIO's case it is a technology that's being worked on with support from local government. So I'm guessing they have a solution to this problem.

>I think home computing is quickly moving to the cloud. 

This is one of my most speculative guesses. I just think with some cars that's using Lidar (not Tesla, but like NIO) they are going to be using some super powerful chips with AI.

Can those chips also do double duty as home computers? I don't know. This is just pure (uneducated) guessing on my part.

>Folks already have home security with stuff like ring. It doesnt doo much besides give piece of mind

This one I'm pretty confident about. If you park your car on the curb, it gives you wider view of the whole neighborhood. I'm not saying you buy it JUST for this, but it's a nice additional active alarm that raises your POV from your house.

The big issue here is how much does this affect our privacy? If our cars are constantly collecting information, how secure is that information? Metromile wants to use that info to decrease our insurance. But what if the FBI wants to use it to do warrantless searches?

>Kids to activities, gramps to errands, me to wirk, all can be distributed on demand ownership

Most retail investors will lose money in this so these kind of trades are unlikely to continue unless there is a clear financial incentive for retail investors to pile into crappy companies. What's happening with GME is as lucrative to the average investor as a penny stock pump and dump scheme. 

The only people that will win are the companies which can issue new shares and the original investors who got in early enough that they're not risking the potential 90%+ downside when the inevitable correction comes.

This narrative that hedgefunds never get punished for being over-levered is also just incorrect, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LI395YShGRQ

This event might cause some hedgefund managers to assess and reconsider their short positions – if you have short exposure to a stock like AMC it might make sense for the time being to reduce or close that position, but I strongly suspect this will be a short-term trend without a strong financial incentive for it to continue.

I'm not even sure if it makes sense to put an artificial limit the level of short-interest a stock can have. I keep hearing people talking it being ""fraudulent"" or immoral that a stock can have more than 100% short-interest, but I don't see any reason to think that. If investors are stupid enough to short a stock with that much short interest this is what can happen. The market is responding in an extreme, but fairly rational way to shorts being too greedy. This isn't a problem the regulators need to address given the market is literally addressing it as we speak.

And for those complaining about the stock being pumped to excessively high levels, it's worth remembering that a stock which is trading at an excessively high valuation can also crash to unreasonably low levels as investors begin to short so this can and does happen in reverse. People don't always invest in a stock for rational reasons either. Some people just really like TSLA and don't care about the valuation. That's fine. The strength of the market is that it will work itself out on its own and people making stupid bets will lose out when the eventually market returns to rationality.

Really the only thing new about this is that it's being sold as retail vs wallstreet so there is a bunch of media hype around it. Hedge funds go bankrupt from being over-levered all the time, short-squeezes happen all the time, markets price stocks irrationally all the time.

The US gave TSM a nice deal in order to build a plant in Arizona. From a security standpoint, the US don't want to be reliant on high tech when it produces outside of its territory. This is a good compromise for the US govt as the plant may be foreign owns but production is in US. Hell, even Gayna tried to steal TSM's IPs.

1 very important thing though. It's generally is a slow mover. People who buy FDs on this tend to get fuck. This is why I have shares and long dated OTM (leap).

Right now, TSM somewhat is holding a monopoly on fab production as their product is the best.

The iOS 14 privacy changes should only affect ad-tracking within the [Facebook Audience Network](https://www.facebook.com/audiencenetwork/) (which is a slight fraction of total ad revenue), not in-app ad service. Just look his July 2018 ER comments as how much he overstates future headwinds (his comments about increasing expenditures wiped $100B off FB's market cap the following day). This is a ""CYA condiment"" on a giant nothing-burger.

In the meantime, politicians still have no idea as to how to breakup (anti-trust), nor regulate (content moderate) the company. The anti-trust suit's claims are flimsy at best, when social media outlets like TikTok, Snap, Discord, Clubhouse, et al. exist and thrive. One simply cannot make a substantial argument that FB's dominance is hurting the consumer (which is the bar to which other companies are held during anti-trust investigations).

When it comes to content moderation, neither Republicans, nor Democrats have put forward a single, tangible policy recommendation as to how to regulate what should or shouldn't be allowed on the platform. And no, inflammatory and emotional commentary on Twitter from members in Congress doesn't count. The GOP couldn't agree on anything when they controlled both the White House and Congress, and neither will the Democrats now.

Go ahead and make the bear case for the company. Because, as I currently see it, FB now has $61B in its war chest and continues to prints money by growing revenue (20%+ YoY), expanding its userbase (14% YoY) and adding to its product line (e.g. Instagram Reels).

546,AM,"Question:

I have always thought of the stock market as an auction house, wherein, shares are offered at the selling price and then bought for either a lower or a higher price. But here's my quandary: In a regular auction, the item being auctioned is offered at a certain price and then that price fluctates in specific increments until it reaches its final price. What I can't seem to find an answer to, is by what increments does share price change from offer to offer.

For example: in this first case, a share of AMC was worth 11.6$ at 10:00 AM yesterday. Five minutes later at 10:05 it was worth 13.02$. While in the second case, that same share was worth 14.07$ at 12:15 and at 12:20 was worth 14.06$.

In the first case, the share had jumped 142 cents per 5 minutes (28.4 cents per minute). And in the second case, the share had dropped 1 cent per 5 minutes.

At what increment could the share's price have been changing for it to only have shifted 1 cent in those 5 minutes. And yes I understand that trading is happening every millisecond and that it went up and down during those 5 minutes and only landed on a 1 cent difference after exactly 5 minutes, but my questions remain:

By what increment do stocks go up/down when somebody wants to buy them?
If I buy multiple shares of a stock at the same time how could I be getting them at the same price?
If I bought all of the shares left of a stock trading at 100$ a share, could I get buy them all that instant at the same price?
In a a regular auction, I couldn't just buy an item for 0.00000001% above/below asking price, there would be a minimal increment as I assume there must be for the stock market.

I am simply perplexed by how a share price could go up or down when there are millions of transactions happening ever second determining and redetermining the price of the share. How could I know I am buying a share for 100$ while as I am submitting my order to buy, thousands of other people have just sold and bought it at different prices, how could my price from one second ago still be available.

I would greatly appreciate any and all answers to these questions and links to any materials online that could help educate me on the matter. I haven't been able to find any myself.

Hello, guys

I  have a couple of question about trading platforms. I am reading and  reading reviews and I do not know what to choose. 2 months ago, I made  an eToro account, mainly because it has good reviews and it is highly  advertised. I didn t deposit anything yet, my plan being to learn  something about investing first (Udemy, YouTube, etc.).

Today,  I found out about Trading 212 and I saw some YouTube channels praising  it and saying it s way better than eToro (something to do with overnight  fees \[?\], pips \[?\] and some other stuff I do not understand yet).

1. I am from Europe. What should I choose? Is there any other platform that you recommend?

2.1.  I am worried about taxes. I understand that if play taxes ONLY for the  selling of stocks and it doesn t matter if I reinvest the money or if I  withdraw it. Is that correct?

2.2. I understand that you need to declare the wins and loses (?) every year until march. Is that correct?

2.2.1. For example, if I buy a stock in 2019 and I sell it in 2020, I have to declare in 2021. Is this correct as well?

2.2.2.  Also, I heard that on Trading 212 you don t have to play taxes if you  are from the UK because of some ISA thingy I don t know the meaning of.  Fortunately, I am not from the UK, lol.

I don t know if this is the right place to ask this. Should I make a post or seek advice somewhere else?

Generally, selling on a dip I think depends how much you put in, how much you gained, and how much you need the money. If you don't need the money, I think it's generally a bad idea to pull out because then you tend to miss out on recoveries. But you always have to calculate if you think you hit the floor or if it will KEEP going down. And where, if you pull out, where you are going to put your money next or when you'll jump back in. That's the key question I think you need to answer for yourself. I'd do your own research after listening to people and come to your own conclusions. Think about the potential upside and downside for each decision.

Now, as for me, I wasn't in on BB to begin with. But I bought in recently, on the dip. I still see it as a big gamble. Because I don't know how to answer that key question.

From there, with extra money, you can either contribute more into your 401k or open up a Roth or Traditional IRA. Personally, I first ensure that I contribute to my 401k to get my employer's match (as you already do). Next, I max out my Roth IRA (annual limit is $6k currently). From there, I add more to my 401k.  

You can skip the Roth IRA if you wish, but I prefer it since it allows more freedom with investing versus an employer's 401k plan. The taxes also work differently (pre-tax vs. post-tax basically), so that's something you should look into if you're considering it.

Honestly, for some time we have been struggling to prevent people form just completely ignoring the rules and I've been tossing around various ideas to hopefully act as a bit of a standing hurdle to posting in this sub.  

Some background: /r/investing was not initially, and never really intended to be, a ""help me invest"" subreddit.  It was always a place for investors to get together and discuss news items or various happenings in the investment world.  As this place grew it gained more and more subscribers and a substantial percentage of them were new and wanted help - nothing wrong with that but it leads to repetitive questions, regulars don't like repetitive questions, and frankly regulars are what makes a quality subreddit.  So we made the daily advice thread, and that worked well enough for years(I mean, we started with the daily thread in like 2013 or something).

Basically, nowadays Reddit has completely changed.  The site is entirely different, it's algorithms drive people to new subreddits and encourage posting, and the culture of new redditors is not the same - so very few people read the rules or search content before posting.  A ton of the recent posts, GME related or not, should have been google searches.  

I've tossed around a few proposals in my head, but frankly I really don't know what to do.  I'm increasingly busy at work and often go days without logging in, and honestly while I do a lot of the posts like this I don't actually do much mod stuff for weeks on end due to work , the rest of the mod team is fantastic but we still need more and nobody seems to be volunteering(by that I mean we're not taking random people as mods, we're looking for actual contributors to the sub to also act as mods).

Ideas I'd like to put up for debate:

1) Removing the top sticky, and making the two stickies a daily advice thread and a daily general discussion thread.

2) preventing self posts, and requiring all posts be link posts with OP adding a comment of, idk, 250 characters before approval (Automod can do this).

3) Literally just going to /r/needamod and adding randoms - I hate this idea because I generally think people who want to mod communities they don't have a long history of participating in are super suspect.

As such, they don't need an oil explo team any more other than to extract maximum value out of existing finds. I believe they have kept on 100 people for that purpose, to scout around the edges of existing fields.

I would assume they know how many people they need to exploit existing fields maximally and how long those fields will last to give a solid runway into renewables.

I have a feeling that BP's plan to exploit government green energy subsidies and carbon capture subsidies is going to pay off a lot better than having 600 extra people look for fields that will never be exploited.

677,IPOE,"Ignore the lawyer thing.  Those law firms file lawsuits against pretty much all SPACs.  It's annoying.  

As far as the drop, I think a few things are happening: 

(1) **Risk Off Today:** Most stocks were down today, but even more so for risk-on stocks.  SPACs tend to be on the riskier side of the spectrum for investors.  When there's an overall market pull back, the riskier assets will tend to see a higher drop as people flee to safer assets.  

(2) **SPAC Pattern:** A lot of the shine has worn off of IPOE.  SPACs will often run a bit immediately after the target announcement, then pullback as the newness wears off, then run again into the merger/listing, then drop again after the listing.  There's a pretty well documented pattern with these, likely due to investor psychology.   As always, there are notably exceptions to this.  

(3) **Valuation:** With IPOE at $18.00/share, SoFi is being valued at over $15 billion.  That's a pretty hefty sum for a company that is still up and coming in the FinTech space.  Plus, it's 80% higher than what the sponsors paid for it.  So you're basically buying a company that has already run 80% post-IPO.  You're bound to see some selling after that and some people re-evaluating the valuation.  

All that said, I'm also an owner of IPOE/SOFI, average cost basis \~$20.00.  I'm using this as an opportunity to buy more.   If it keeps falling, I'll keep buying and averaging down.  I believe in Noto (CEO), Chamath (Sponser), the product (SoFi app), and the enterprise business (Galileo).

Yes, they can’t get bikes to people who ordered them fast enough. Enough so that their own website has links to FB local market place where you can pick up a used bike. 

Back to precor, they manufacture commercial gym equipment. Which gives them an inroad to commercial workout spaces at some point when the pandemic is over. So think hotel gyms etc. The company has not officially said anything about this. They are trying to solve their first headache which is fixing the supply chain 

I can also see a potential for tying up with Gym chains, like lifetime or 24 hour fitness to provide steaming rides that people take together. So, go to your fav big box gym, do a bike/tread whatever workout in a group setting with a big screen. After that enjoy the amenities the big gym has to offer: sauna, maybe swim or weights etc. 

Also, they have not released a rowing machine yet but I bet it’s coming soon. 

Finally, they are yet to expand to new markets. Currently it’s only in US, Canada, U.K. and Germany. Presumably, they will switch expand to more countries.  

Full disclosure: I’m long peloton. I use their app service. Didn’t buy the bike, bought a “cheap one” because I wasn’t sure. But now I kinda regret it.

Bike sales might be loss leader, but they also have accessories AND they are buying an equipment mfg (which I'm not sure I like the idea of but should cut costs of bike/tread mfg). This will put them into equipment sales as a core function.

Expansion to other exercises - already do running/treadmill and biking. The PreCor acquisition will put them in others.

Global expansion - they are already at least in Europe in their original business. I expect PreCor immediately elevates that global push (but don't know PreCor's foreign sales).
