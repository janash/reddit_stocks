72,WISH," In for $420k for ITM LEAPS on WISH. I got in at $14, then averaged down at $11.95, and then again at $10.40. Thesis remains the same. Even though these guys sell garbage products, they are becoming the dollar store of e-commerce, and consumers know what they‚Äôre getting. The product is mainly the ""experience"" of shopping and seeking a deal, similar to spinning a roulette wheel. The gamification of their app and development of additional revenue streams make me bullish over the longer term. It's basically crystallized consumerism.

Those 7/16 $10c are going to expire worthless. I bought them with premium obtained from a diagonal spread, though, so it‚Äôs a wash.

It‚Äôs called a declining cost curve, batteries get cheaper as ICE vehicles do not. Mass market EVs will be available within the next 3 years and have far better performance than ICE at a comparable price. 

Comparing current EV sales to current ICE sale is like comparing the model T sales to horse sales. It‚Äôs incredibly stupid but understandable how you think it matters, the EV will kill ICE.

You‚Äôd be retarded not to buy an EV at this point if you are in the price range of $50k, you claim to own a Tesla so why‚Äôd you buy it? Is it one of the point I just brought up?

It's not about bandwidth and delivering video. You need a brand new architecture streaming games. Being able to pause, change device, ""install"" new games instantly, and lets not forget really expensive hardware to actually render the games before streaming them.

All this whilst being in many datacenters around all regions to get decent latency.

Then they need streaming devices and gamepads. Would people buy a new streaming box for Netflix gaming? :S TV? Many don't support gamepads and are super slow to get going with inefficient UI. Comparing this to how every little Bluray box to the latest third party stick can do Netflix.

Lastly, if they want to license games that's an uphill battle. Make their own games? Same thing there...

I remember trying desperately to get that guy who Yolo'd his deceased father's inheritance into Wish at 11.50 to close his positions. That just hurts so much imagining his father worked ass off his whole life to provide for his family after he passes and then his kid turns around and literally gives his life savings to Citadel.

What a shame, if he is sticking to that retarded ""diamond hands"" BS then he is in for much more red in the future.

Most notably, its focused on free/highly subsidized community college along with investments in health care and early childhood education.

The 1 trillion dollar infrastructure bill is a separate bill that is still on the table. this bill is slated to be the ""bipartisan bill"" that they believe will be passed. I am incredibly doubtful about this passing. Especially since it seems like some GOP senators have taken to sounding the ""Budget Deficit"" arguments over and over again. Crucially it would need at least 60+ votes in the Senate to pass. Even with the 5 + GOP stooges they got on board isnt enough to get the bill passed.

The larger 3.5 trillion dollar bill however, is far more likely to pass as it will be proposed under reconciliation, as a spending bill. This means that Democrats could pass it with a simple majority vote, the tie being broken by VP Kamala. There hasn't been too many details released about this bill, mostly stating the expansion of the Social Safety Net. Bill will likely include plenty of spending on renewable/green energy.

Both bills are up in the air, GOP members have shown resentment for having both bills being proposed at once. Joe Manchin will probably talk about the need for bipartisanship and stall both bills for all eternity.

1162,CS," I want to preface this by making it absolutely clear I fucking hate eBay and the way it‚Äôs run with a passion. I also don‚Äôt like engaging in the well known ‚Äúconspiracy‚Äù that is eBay is hiding sales. 

However,
 I own a company that sells European automotive parts and for years consistently did ~90k a month. Last September after the crazy covid boom it felt like what was the most intense light switch being turned off I‚Äôve ever seen. Over night every month was going lower and lower fast. Different timeframe than you but same thing. 

We still to this day have never been able to get it back above 35k which compared to previously is just pathetic. It‚Äôs been over a year for fucks sake lol. No drastic changes in inventory (actually just increasing) 99.7% feedback / 0% late scan or delivery / 0 seller defects / 1 day handling / free shipping. I mean what more do these cucks want?

I don‚Äôt ever call CS for these kind of issues specifically but if I‚Äôm already on the phone I will bring it up and they always make you feel like you‚Äôre looney. 

No clue what the actual cause is but you can find patents for their algos online and one part that has always stuck with me talks about a tactic they like is to keep as many sellers on the site to primarily benefit the market (aka eBay) by ‚Äúsharing the wealth‚Äù among sellers. They need you to just sell enough to stay on the site, the rest gets fed to others for the same purpose. Streaming services such as nflx and Hulu can make they primary income with subscriptions so my personal theory is eBay just wants as many sellers on the site paying for the store subscription. 

I don‚Äôt need them to survive so I say once again fuck eBay and part of me hopes they go under.

The stimulus and unemployment savings won‚Äôt even last a year for most people. It won‚Äôt have a long term effect. In the Short term it has already made the market volatile, but as more people run out of money to invest from losses it will get soaked up by the hedge funds and the people who win will end up with enough money to use traditional investment strategies and have a passive income. Those who don‚Äôt will struggle to get enough saved to invest in anything.

Your ignorance is showing. Not all pre-revenue SPACs are the same.

1260,CHPT," Devils advocate here. Using napkin math and assumptions let‚Äôs assume 85% of EV charging will occur at home. This is the cheapest and most logical place and time to charge. Another 10% are done by long distance drivers. This would be done on highways where fast 150+kw charging will be the necessity. So that leaves the remaining 5% of charging done by people who forgot to charge at home for some reason or could not get to 150kw+ fast charger. These people would seek a 50kw charger like EVGO as you rightly point out. 

So to me EVGO sits in the never-never land of charging. In my vision of the future non-home charging will be ruled by slow cheap chargers at work and super fast chargers by highways. There will be a small market for 50kw chargers but people will be so well trained to charge at home that they will rarely need to 50kw chargers that EVGO offers. 

Add to that the low profits per charging station. I estimate at most these stations generate $35k in gross profit. And probably $5k in net profit after you include all operating expenses. EVGO has only 800 charging stations. Let‚Äôs assume they grow to 50,000 stations in the next 10-20 years. That‚Äôs $250M in net income. With a market cap of $2.5B that‚Äôs richly valued. 

So hype may drive up the stock price. But given the small size of the target market I just don‚Äôt see it‚Äôs business model being very successful. 

Think about it. People won‚Äôt plug in their car for a charge while they are shipping unless they have to. Why spend $6 to ‚Äútop up‚Äù you battery when you still have 150 miles of range on your car just because you are shopping?  And these charging stations are usually at the far end of the parking lot!  Most people will just wait to plug in at home. 

So to me the future will have very few charging stations. Charging will he done at home or along highways. Moreover, I personally think hydrogen will eventually be a big part of the transportation energy infrastructure. Batteries are just so heavy and inefficient and expensive.

1262,CHPT," I would not say CHPT is a ""scam"" - I just think their business model is less favorable to the end-user than EVGO's, and their value proposition doesn't allow for as much *growth*.

As an end-user of these stations, I only use a Chargepoint when it's a last resort, and would much rather seek out an Electrify America or an EVGO station.

Why is that? Because the experience of Chargepoint stations is less consistent (and frequently, less good).

Why is that?

CHPT sells the charge unit to businesses and installers, but they don't have an equivalently robust support network to fix broken chargers. Additionally CHPT's network footprint has a very small percentage of fast chargers. (Because you need a lot more capital to install a fast charger than a slow one).

CHPT is in the business of selling you the actual charger and the monthly subscription service for it more than they are in the business of owning the network. There's certainly opportunity in making and selling high-quality chargers to installers. CHPT also has a highly-regarded home unit that is sold direct to consumers on Amazon and such.

But, CHPT doesn't really get any of the markup on electricity from most of their sites. The individual ""station owner"" or franchisee determines the price to park and price for electricity.

Investing in EVGO is like investing in cell phone tower networks in the 80's, versus investing in the companies that make the cell tower equipment.

Investing in CHPT is like investing in a company that makes power strips. Sure, as more people need to plug in more stuff, they'll have to make more power strips. And if you're buying a power strip, it's worth buying a good one (Think of CHPT like an APC or a Belkin); so it doesn't zap you or burn down your building. There are valid places to install Level 2 chargers, such as hotels and offices where people will be spending \~8 hours, and CHPT is probably the most effective network and product for it.

CHPT's product is about making and selling an inexpensive product and selling directly to businesses and franchisees. EVGO's product is about bringing electricity to strategic locations, such that the electricity can be significantly marked up due to convenience. There's a lot more long term potential to make money off the top of electricity forever, compared to making money off of $10k-$50k charge unit sales.",andy-broker,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/okiliv/andy_on_ev_charge_stocks_i_like_evgo_a_lot_and/h58etcb/,0.013,0.879,0.108,0.9896

Your assumptions are not logical (e.g. gas cars being more expensive that EV). You assume there will be this huge infrastructure built to support charging stations yet you don‚Äôt think that same infrastructure will be built in apartment buildings?  Go check out some apartment buildings and how they have installed chargers for their residents. Go check out office buildings and how they have installed chargers. The infrastructure will be built where it is needed. I‚Äôd like to love EVGO but they logic and the math just don‚Äôt support it.

1275,WKHS," What the heck is this crap. Here are some responses to your crap solutions.

\#2 - Until the hub motors are out in the wild, any performance claims or longevity claims should be taken with a grain of salt. They performed terribly at the SF250 with extremely slow speeds and terrible efficiency (makes sense considering it is unsprung weight that also has a rotational inertia penalty). What about overheating, which even if the structure holds up means you have a worthless motor.

\#3 - You can build these in 8 hours... Great, where are the production vehicles if this is so easy. I guess overstating some general point, and ignoring details is the name of the game.

\#4 - ATVM loan is not happening. The Government is not bailing out Lordstown only to have them go bankrupt. This company already had crazy unethical behavior by the principals, especially selling stock before putting out bad news. Would reek of bad government if money is given here and they don't pay it back. - Oh, when Steve Burns was by Workhorse he also used to talk about how WKHS was just about to get the ATVM loan... Get real, it ain't happening.

Asset backed funding... No one wants the factory. The assets that they put in, are worth less than what they cost them as the resale value will be much less.

\#5 - Unsprung Mass - In your own words, ""including through tuning of the suspension, reinforcing the vehicle structure, and utilizing a heavier truck chassis."" Well look here, this is an EV that we need to keep weight down to ensure maximum range, so what we are doing is adding weight... Seriously! Oh, and we want to simplify the manufacturing process to keep cost down, so we are overengineering the suspension and frame... Yeah right... This is crazy talk and makes no sense.

\#8 - Warranty on battery - who cares... this company is going bankrupt next year. Warranty won't be covered.

\#9 - What is there to dislike, in addition to the above? At their demo day they limited speeds to 40 mph, because their brake supplier required that (how stupid does that sound). How can you trust that this thing is reliable at highway speed? What about the unethical behavior of the people who started the company? Frankly, why would anyone believe a single thing they claim until they are willing to let independent third-parties get their hands on it and validate their claims.

This company deserves to die and anyone giving them funding will almost certainly lose it. The chance of them ever producing a successful EV is probably about 0%.",aka0007,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/okv0b7/ten_solutions_for_ride_lordstown_discussion/h5b1klm/,0.143,0.769,0.087,-0.9834
