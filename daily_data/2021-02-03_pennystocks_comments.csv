If you buy some pennies for $100, expect to lose $100 AND be happy with it, but hope for exponential returns.  My other recommendation is, do not bet against the markets (short sell ).   I tried it during the pandemic and lost $$$ because I got nevous because I could have Lost unknown amounts betting against ASNA.

3,ABC," I think you've kind of said it all with DD - do your research and if it doesn't look/feel right then don't do it.  

I see that a bunch of people come on here to get users to help them out of a bad jam or to pump up their sell point.  Does this sound familiar?  Yes, it is just like the news, but I suggest people do what a person with half a brain does: fact check.

As for me and penny stocks, I'm fairly new.  However, I checked out OVTZ based on some technical screens I ran and saw the upward momentum possibility.  I checked all their financials, and technical information from 1 day, 3 day, 10 day, 14 day, 1 month, 3 month, 6 month.  I was looking for trends and it looked positive.  I also went to their website and read up on their SaaS product and found it to be noteworthy, useful, and possibly have a global customer base and that they acquired another tech company that added shares and privacy products.  They've gone from $0.45 to $1.63 in a week.  I did a lot of work on this to make sure it was what I wanted.  I even built ppt's for crying out loud.  

So, if you don't understand what you should look at in a company then I would say start with a checklist:

1. Research the company itself - websites, products, SEC reports, OTCMarkets, and new reports, etc.  PR creates perception.
2. Take a look at their books: Income statements, Balance Sheets, Cash Flow Statements, return percentages, etc.
3. Check the charts: On my charts I always have these indicators set: Bollinger bands, linear regression, PSAR, Volume by price, and I'll have these lower indicators: RSI(14), MACD Histogram, Williams %R, DMI, Volume.  The Bid/Ask spread and put/call ratio also important to look at.  Smaller the bid/ask spread then the greater the liquidity.
4. Try to use an application with your broker that allows live updates to price and 2nd level bid/ask information.  In penny stocks you need the most up-to-date information, not a 15 minute lag.  The bid/ask info shows the buy and sell orders currently put in for a specified stock providing you with market depth information that is valuable: possible support level (large bids) and possible resistance level (large asks).
5. Have an exit strategy.  For example: You buy 10,000 shares of ABC and all the DD you've done indicates a break out going up soon.  A possible exit strategy could be to have an 1st exit price at 20% increase in price and sell 5,000 shares, and 2nd exit price at 40% increase and sell the remaining shares, but also a stop-loss at a reasonable point like -15%.  However, your exit strategy isn't just based on numbers, but on risk appetite. It may be valuable for you to complete a risk statement - put pen to paper - write it down and say it out loud to see if it makes you feel queasy or not.

Lastly, if you don't know what any of the financial or technical stuff is, then check out investopedia, it's great for breaking it down barney style.",AnUnusedCondom,35,/r/pennystocks/comments/lbaj02/for_new_investors_caught_in_the_euphoria_of/gltpiwo/,0.026,0.854,0.12,0.994

5,DD," Thanks for the post. Great point of view. Honestly I'm new here but I want to learn as much as I can about penny stocks and apply that to my ""investing style"" if you will. It only takes a few minutes to google a ticker name and read a few articles to get a better feel for a company. That I have learned quickly. I read about Vaxart a few weeks ago and told a friend about it and she is in the green with them this week. So it does pay to DD absolutely.

6,EV," Ahhh.. pennies are fun!  I have been playing pennies for years.  I don't swing.   I buy a penny every year as a scratch ticket!  My last major one was ABML.  It has worked out well. Bunch of shares- average .10. 

 With that knowledge my penny picking ability has progressed a bit.  I look for things that are Novel.  That have a business.   That are green.  That have upcoming catalysts for the future. Also reverse mergers.

 I'm still holding ABML.  2020 I bought into TSNP because I loooove what they can do for international currency exchanges.   All the other stuff they are adding is good too.  But the first thing I like about them is why I hold.  

 I'm also into BLSP.  They are dark right now but they won't be for long.  I like what they are doing in Europe and I like that they will likely show revenue in the US. 


 I am super excited to be holding OZSC.  They have huge clients already.  They just went public via a reverse merger.  The products they already produce will make EV charging in the time it takes to pump a tank of gas will be game changing. 

 I've held losers.   I'm also pretty happy with my buy and hold strategy.   Just have to pick the winners and hold- ignore the hype.  Know what you own.",it_swims,64,/r/pennystocks/comments/lbaj02/for_new_investors_caught_in_the_euphoria_of/glt2jka/,0.032,0.78,0.188,0.9871

If I’m not completely off my rocker I think that I’ve started to form an okay plan. So please correct me if I’m just totally missing the mark. I’m here to learn. My plan is to start out small. Like $100 small. I’ve been looking at Ford and GM. For long term stocks to start. But also would like to test the waters on short term stocks. So my plan there is to a. Study the company. B. Look at the 1 month to year charts. C. Look at the average low and high. D. Buy in at the low and set a sell price about half way between the low and high. E. Continue to watch/check the stock and re evaluate using the candle sticks. Does something like this sound okay? What are all your recommendations?,Thenub2289,0,/r/pennystocks/comments/lbaj02/for_new_investors_caught_in_the_euphoria_of/gltca6s/,0.051,0.868,0.082,0.6662

Lol, not sure how I let that happen as I'm very aware that this is a thing. I am however new to trading as of these past few weeks. Big FOMO, lack of familiarity with different platforms, and not enough DD looking at detractors first and potential bear cases. Had just woken up and i know that was part of it. Yes, i looked at the company elsewhere but clearly it was not enough to understand the dynamic of what was going on that morning with the stock price.

Not again!! DD for a day or at least a while before pulling any type of significant trigger.

A lot of times a stock I'm invested in may be trading sideways and there's no news, so I go to StockTwits to see if anyone knows anything.

123,DD," Strong background in medicine not stock so this isn’t financial advise. Tamoxifen is a breakthrough drug but has a large portion of patients that can’t take it. Look up CYP450 enzyme system in the liver. Several common medications, including a lot of commonly prescribed antidepressants, reduce the ability of Tamoxifen from being processed essentially making it a sugar pill. I mean anyone who has cancer is going to be depressed, not to mention Prozac was the top 5 most prescribed medication (not just antidepressants) in like 2016(?). Others increase its absorption resulting in toxic levels. I’m posting a link to a laymen website to give you basic understanding so you can do a DD if you want. Also nasal COVID treatment at home will still be useful through 2021 to prevent over running of hospitals which will improve mortality over all if staff aren’t over worked and can focus on their jobs. Last thing....COVID will always be around and think of this as the potential of the flu antivirals like Tamiflu with the added benefits that it can potentially prevent long term lung damage by reducing viral infections in the first place.

134,CEO," Part 3


The only other competitor is $EAR and they're currently trading around the $50-60 range. On the topic of Eargo (EAR) Inc, they are only an online retailer with no physical stores. They are however like the Bose Headphones of hearing aids from the sounds of the website. But, it looks like they're target market is upper class... they're cheapest option is the base model at $19XX with the top of the line running you roughly $2950! Gross profit wise they reported $12.8 mil in 3rd quarter... up from $4.2 mil in 3rd quarter 2019. 

They're primed to be up in this area IMO... hell even half of what they're trading would be amazing. Currently selling in Walmart, Sears, another retailer I cant think of, and on Amazon. They also already have a handful of brick and mortar stores in NorCal with plans to take over the entire West Coast. They're target market is the average Joe IMO. Like I stated earlier, they plan to partner up and sign contracts with a host of other retailers including Target, Walgreens, CVS, Rite Aid, and Best Buy just to name a few. According to the CEO, with the proposed retail stores they projecting $EAR level revenue and with the FDA Approval they project to be x100 more in revenue. 

$EAR is really the only other competition, but it does give a small insight into the hearing aid market. Another hearing aid company is in Minnesota, but it sounds like that company has a host of upper management issues that is currently putting them in and out of court. They also havent released a product in a few years. Found a handful of others as well, but didnt really dig past Eargo Inc.

With INND's new product, they'll be selling the base model at $995 and the top of the line at $1450. On top of that, they have a large handful of kiosks in Wal Marts that are free to use (with plans to roll out more in the very near future). What's the purpose of the kiosks? ""InnerScope’s Hearing Loss Information Center will encourage Walmart customers to take immediate action for treating their hearing loss by either being referred locally to a contracted hearing healthcare professional, or by directly purchasing one of InnerScope’s Hearing Products."" They're currently in about 4500 Walmarts.

Now for the bad, but good. They're currently delinquent on SEC Filings. HOWEVER, they're working on becoming current within the next 55 days. The last time they filed financials was back in 2018! I honestly havent looked at numbers because of this and I'm still learning how to read all the numbers.

Last but not least, remember I OWN a large cheap/low risk to me position... do your own DD and feel free to verify all my info. In regards to a penny stock this is a very long 12-18 month min hold. I'm planning to hold all million shares til at a minimum then. I know a handful of others that are doing the same. I'm not trying to pump (twitter account has 6 followers haha, I generally lurk here, and I havent publically said anything on social media), but every close friend I've told has bought a position into it. Right now you can spend $78 for 10k shares if you want to take a super small position. 

Best part about this is, the CEO updates the company twitter page nightly and is completely transparent! Also, yesterday, one of the twitter peeps I follow has been asking the CEO questions and asked him if he sees this reaching 5 cents before March with the next 2 PR releases. CEO responded that he does see it reaching 5 cents in the near future and that the next 30 days will be interesting.

At the end of 2021/beginning of 2022 the CEO hopes they'll be high enough to uplist again to a New York Exchange, get out of the OTC market, and bring in more investors.

Last, but not least, my personal take on March...

They're working on contracts with major retail stores, but a few stores want to see it listed as a mid tier OTC as well as FDA approval so they can invest in them... which I'm assuming means buy product. They just announced they're releasing a new product in March and coming current with SEC filings in the next 55 days. Maybe I'm completely wrong, but I'm now wondering if March is when literally everything comes together. They're projecting the stock to be above 1 cent or 10 cents, contracts with all the major retailers get approved, and to ""celebrate"" in a way they start off those contracts with a new product in all the new stores. It wouldnt make sense to launch the old product in new stores for a month then turn around and send out the new and improved model

The only other competitor is $EAR and they're currently trading around the $50-60 range. On the topic of Eargo (EAR) Inc, they are only an online retailer with no physical stores. They are however like the Bose Headphones of hearing aids from the sounds of the website. But, it looks like they're target market is upper class... they're cheapest option is the base model at $19XX with the top of the line running you roughly $2950! Gross profit wise they reported $12.8 mil in 3rd quarter... up from $4.2 mil in 3rd quarter 2019. 

They're primed to be up in this area IMO... hell even half of what they're trading would be amazing. Currently selling in Walmart, Sears, another retailer I cant think of, and on Amazon. They also already have a handful of brick and mortar stores in NorCal with plans to take over the entire West Coast. They're target market is the average Joe IMO.

3. ""The FDA is establishing regulations that manufacturers of OTC hearing aids will need to follow. In general, these federal regulations will:

The labels will also include warnings and other information you should know before buying or when using the hearing aid, such as signs that indicate that you should see your primary care provider or other health care professional.

Currently, hearing devices that you can buy directly (without seeing a health care professional first) are not intended for people with hearing loss. Importantly, these devices, known as personal sound amplification products (PSAPs), are for people without hearing loss to boost their ability to hear certain sounds in certain situations, such as while hunting. PSAPs are not regulated as medical devices by the FDA. In contrast, the FDA will regulate forthcoming OTC hearing aids as medical devices for adults with hearing loss.""

July 24, 2018

Dear Hearing Aid Manufacturer: 

In section 709 of the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017 (FDARA), Congress enacted a definition, outlined certain requirements, and set forth a process for establishing a category of over-the-counter (OTC) hearing aids and the requirements that apply to them. That statutorily mandated process provides for FDA to publish proposed regulations by August 18, 2020, to consider public comments, and then to publish final regulations within 180 days of the close of the comment period. Section 709 also includes a preemption provision stating that no state or local law can be different from, in addition to, or not identical to, the regulations that FDA will establish for OTC hearing aids under authority of FDARA. 

Section 709 reflects a careful balance between consumer access to new technologies and consumer protections to assure the safety and effectiveness of OTC hearing aids. The protections include output limits, appropriate labeling, advisements about when to consult with a licensed health care practitioner, and guidance on when premarket review by FDA would be required.

Section 709 is not self-implementing, meaning that the OTC hearing aid category, as defined by FDARA section 709, does not exist until the effective date of a published final regulation. Until that time, no products that are claimed to address hearing loss are, or can claim to be, OTC hearing aids within the meaning of FDARA section 709.

Currently, hearing aids continue to be restricted devices, for which sales must follow applicable federal and state requirements. FDA has published a guidance document stating that the agency will not enforce the requirement for a medical evaluation or waiver under 21 CFR 801.421, but manufacturers should be mindful of any similar state law requirements. 

If you have questions about this communication, please contact the Division of Industry and Consumer Education (DICE) at DICE@FDA.HHS.GOV 800-638-2041 or 301-796-7100.

me personally, i'm so used to SNDL on this cycle for the past year:

goes past $1, everyone praising it and thinking they're smart af for sticking with it, and the usual praise that it'll exceed $2 soon, then it starts to die off back towards the sub-$1 if not sub $0.80s

&#x200B;

sorry yo, i just don't know anymore but i can still say that i'm a SNDL vet cause it's given me some nightmares when i got ""stuck holding bags""

i'm personally waiting for it to go back under $1.10 and gonna pick up a few hundred shares, if it dips lower than $1, i'll buy the exact same amount of shares to average down. if it dips crazily tho, like under $0.88 i'mma pick up a lot to swing it again",leejohn1015,3,/r/pennystocks/comments/lbpy4k/sndl_has_gone_up_by_about_20_so_far_today/glw21am/,0.059,0.834,0.108,0.7933

218,SNDL," oh nice! you're at a good spot for a while it seems if you're avg'd under a dollar. the volume on SNDL has been crazy these past few days, especially after Robinhood banned it for a day when it first ran up last week.

you chose a good one since it's one that's popping off in almost every forum i've been on.

so many new holders who got in around $1.10 - $1.15, so that's lookin like a decent sign it'll be higher highs and higher lows as well.

best of luck tho bro. may you see the upper $1.90s+

The way I look at it is CBBT on the market is about to go from no revenue to $16m+ revenue and expanding to 50+ employees, they will have a background in engineering medical devices and with a great concept for Alzheimer's treatment. Once merged and PKG is effectively on the market we're talking about earnings right away and uplist to follow. CBBT will change over night on some random day in the next month or less, I'll take that!

I went deep on the Alzheimer's thing, their approach is legitimate, today there is a surgical procedure done that involves placing Omentum on the brain directly for this benefit, and it in fact works.

Bread & Butter of this stock:

1. Their patented rubber latex, in which they just secured a deal with the largest rubber plantation in the world. HUGE industry use. This rubber is supposed to be stronger, cleaner, more eco-friendly than all other rubber materials currently on the market. Did I mention patented?
2. FDA APPROVED RxAIR Device - a UV Air filtration system that kills 99.9% of airborne bacteria INCLUDING COVID. Manufacturing for this is on the up-tick. School districts across the country are already putting these in their classrooms (hospitals too).

Articles for your reference. Releases HOT off the press today. This is long term value and gains.

\- Company podcast / announcement happening on Thursday

\- Company has been active in looking for partnerships, JVs and acquisitions in the past month (example, targetted additional 2mm revenue / month: [https://s3.amazonaws.com/b2icontent.irpass.cc/2474/rl96594.pdf](https://s3.amazonaws.com/b2icontent.irpass.cc/2474/rl96594.pdf))

\- Company recently received certified installer status approval from Tesla - big for its EV growth trajectory

\- Revenues have increased 4 fold in recent times (additional contracts and projects will just pump it up more)

\- From Company's official twitter account, uplisting is a near term target, which means share price has to go up.

303,OCGN," $OCGN Ocugen is to commercialize COVID vaccine COVAXIN™ in the US Market

Ocugen recent market cap is 0.5 billion which is a joke, should be at least 3 times more. Moderna market cap is 62 Billion. it gained more than 30 Billion since its vaccine news. OCGN current total market cap is only about 0.5 billion. A lot of upside for OCGN

Large demand form US government will fuel OCGN. it will also likely be the only vaccine safe for ppl under 18. Think about how the government will get the kids back to school?

Once the preliminary efficacy data is released (likely in mid Feb), OCGN will prob hit $10. Phase 3 study is going to be completed in March. Once Covaxin is approved, OCGN is likely to hit $50-$80.  I'm long OCGN and expect a quick 20-30X upside from current price

333,PKG," $CBBT spiked last week as the deadline for their acquisition/merger with PKG approached. Predictably the price fell back down once this deadline was missed, however the CEO’s statement was clear, this is still very much going ahead and most encouragingly he confirmed that a significant investment had already been made into PKG. The timing of completion is anyone’s guess but again this statement implied it was in its very final stages so we are likely talking weeks rather than months.

Even if your ignore everything else positive this company has in the pipeline, surely investing until the acquisition goes through is a solid play considering the price hit approx 35% higher than it stands now largely based off this acquisition.

404,SNDL," Ok, so I'm relatively new to investing; hence my interest in Penny stocks - I'm learning with what I can afford to lose, and the faster pace of penny stocks is kicking my learning into high gear.  Its been a few weeks but I've turned 40 into 700 making different plays, and I'm hooked.

Question though, where in the hell do you guys get your target prices from? Do you have a reliable source, go with your gut, mostly lean to reddit?

Take SNDL for instance, I bought a 100 shares at 0.78; mostly based on Reddit hype.

Analysts, across the board, put an expected high from 0.40 to 1.20 the last few months.  We just hit 1.20 (and it looks like it'll rise).  Whats your target price and why?",jpmoney26,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/lbiofa/daily_plays_february_03_2021/gluwg8i/,0.06,0.854,0.085,-0.163

A stretch but I could put 5 packs of water on Amazon and buy them back and put out Pr that we sold out.

Amazon from personal experience. You net anywhere from 1-3% profit off of each product sold after expenses cost of product etc. Preworkouts can be conned to be way more and his bottles aren't cheap . . . so he could be getting around 10-20% difficult to say.

521,CBD," For sure. It's . . . actually ridiculously profitable once you get going.   


But, you also forgot an additional upside.  


CBD + water is on a huge huge huge uptrend due to the fitness and health industry. If he's smart and targets instagrammer fitness enthusiasts with his water + CBD water products ((CBD is currently being used as an anti-inflammatory and anti-anxiety product for fitness and anxiety.   He could generate . . . a lot of money in a very short period of time. Whether he does or doesn't, I don't know. However, that is 100% the play I would make because it will increase brand recognition 10,000 fold and generate substantial profits compared to overly relying on Amazon.   


A single Instagram post from 20 fitness enthusiasts would generate over 10,000,000 eyes on your product. Getting sponsored with professional athletes/ tier 2 athletes amplifies this incredibly.

590,CBD," Hoping this actually posts here.  My ""age"" won't let me contribute yet, which just seems silly.  DD on a stock I came across, based on the movement from INKW and the market space they play in.

 

With  INKW taking off nicely, I started looking at other CBD plays.  GreenGro  caught my eye.  Restrictions on CBD products have been removed in the  last few years.  But, CBD is still associated with marijuana, and  probably still gets a bad wrap.  INKW is going to change a lot of that.   Their partnership to sell CBD infused water on Amazon is going to get a  lot of attention.  So, CBD stocks should all start to gain more  attention.

GRNH has a low overall  share count for a penny stock (585.5 million shares).  It trades OTC,  which I like.... it doesn't have a pink sheet wrap to deal with.  
Volume  buying has hit this stock, along with many other marijuana plays  lately.  There is resistance at .0275.  A strong break above that, and  the stock should continue to run higher on solid volume.

$0.08.  Since then it has briefly peaked @$0.3 and closed today @$.2.  The extraction products are very good but it's the scalability of the Shaman AI that has me thinking of going in deeper.  

Thoughts?


The Corporation is a Calgary-based company that generates technologically-based solutions. With installations all over the world, its patented craft-scale bio-extractors are used to extract compounds from a variety of botanical materials. The SHAMAN division is focusing on applying machine learning to predict potential benefits associated with the use of psychedelic drugs within the mental health misdiagnosis problem.

People don't seem to remember the CBD industry craze where all these dumb pennystocks used that same notion of industry growth and now 80% or better of them are bankrupt and gone. 

As someone who also lives and works in RI, I know for a fact that their medrecycler subsidiary is currently overblown. That control panel for waste energy conversion isn't even active, its literally sitting in storage, I did in person due diligence myself and saw it. 
They claim they want to tackle the medical waste issue that's piling up the RI landfill but their conversion process isn't sustainable for plastics and the landfill is already at capacity. 

I hold 75k shares at 0.03 cost basis and thinking about getting out and booking the gains. Their 10q report is scary but most of the people in the sub won't take the time to read it and make their own judgements. They just want rockets and shit.

Also like I said they're waiting on a reverse split to happen 1000:1 which may never come through. I owned because I saw volumes coming in on the level 2 for the stock after seeing a bunch of posts on it. Just did my own DD after the price went from 31ish cents back down to under ten. My holdings was all based on the fact it had local operations and I saw order flow coming in. Order flow is leaving and the company itself is in trouble financially so there grows my concerns and willingness to sell.

695,CEO," It's in their 10Q report.

https://sec.report/Document/0001493152-20-022329/


The summary paragraphs where they express their concerns on their future due to lack of cemented financing is in the early 20s pages. They put the main point in italics and the paragraphs below explain. 

Around page 18-24 where you see the long paragraph about medrecycler is what I was arguing about with the other user. Their watse to energy facility could be open by June or July but it's entirely dependent on getting financing for the long term. If they don't start generating revenue soon then the entire thing is in jeopardy. The creditors can just shut down their RI projects if they don't deliver on the loan payments. The CEO collateralized medrecycler debt to his own personal common stock and even personal holdings outside of the company so you can tell he's not looking to scam.

There are also pictures and video posted to Twitter, FB, and LinkedIn showing the facility. At this point they’re waiting on a final water permit and they’re ready to rock.

The pyrolysis process they employ is in use in other countries for medical waste (including polymers) successfully. The machines are built by a large South African company and were imported to the facility in RI throughout 2020.

Their Street Smart Outdoor subsidiary produces solar bus shelters and the like, and is the one who just secured all the govt contracts over the last year for 1700. COVID did a bit of a number on their rollout timing, but they’re on track again. Their solar subsidiary is active and already does projects for greenhouses and commercial use with glass panels. Their new patented glass-less and frameless panels were in development from 2017 and were only granted the last patent in 2020. They will be manufacturing them in the US and rolling them out by mid to EOY. 

Rhode Island might have a massive trash problem but you need to start somewhere. This first facility will process 70 tons per day with an option to expand to 140 tons per day. 70 tons per day brings in roughly $15M per year in top line revenue. They’ll also be able to sell back 1-1.3MW of power. There are similar facilities of an even grander scale going up in other states, and MedRecycler will be expanding out of Rhode Island this year and next to continue handling the country’s waste issue.

As far as financial stress goes, even TSLA was nearly bankrupt in recent history. In SNPW’s case, they have funding secured and their debt will be wiped clean within the year.",polkadotbutton,2,/r/pennystocks/comments/lbpgmm/asti_vs_snpw/glwkmm4/,0.069,0.815,0.116,0.8133

747,CMPS," I like psychedelics as a long term hold. I have a high 5 figures invested myself and had my wife purchase a low 5 figures of the horizons ETF + some CMPS. I have large stakes in CMPS, MMED, FTRP, CYBN & NUMI and then smaller investments in a range of other companies. 

There is so much movement in this space right now from leading institutions opening psychedelic research centers to patients being granted exemptions for therapy (Example Canada) - once clinical trials come back with clear signs of efficacy, there is going to be major jumps in these prices. I mean even Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) got approval for their ketamine based drug Spravato. 

With all that said, do beware. There are going to be patent periods for these formulations:

[https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/compass-pathways-granted-patent-covering-use-of-its-psilocybin-formulation-in-addressing-treatment-resistant-depression-820119972.html](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/compass-pathways-granted-patent-covering-use-of-its-psilocybin-formulation-in-addressing-treatment-resistant-depression-820119972.html)

The above is also why CMPS is priced the way it is. I like the others in my portfolio because I either like the clinical research and assets they have and how they might get their own patents or I think they have a very good clinic model (FTRP). 

For those interested, I follow the Dales Report regularly on this space:

The stock is also being heavily manipulated and is undervalued a bit even without the lawsuit.

The down side is it has 105billion float, however the CEO promised to reduce that when they get the cash from $PM. Hopefully that means a buy back instead of a reverse split.

I'm just a noob, with a few shares in meme-stocks that I'm having fun watching while the big guys sweat. But my co-worker, who comes in late every day (because he spends the morning trading penny stocks) gave me this tip this, he also said and that TD Ameritrade let him sell this morning, but wouldn't let him buy back in to reposition.  Because ... I'm a conspiracy theorist, and market fuckery that benefits the rich? I don't currently have a position here, so I can't buy penny stocks straight off the market with my fidelity account, and he and I are either too dumb to figure out limit buying on fidelity ... or again, fuckery, because he couldn't buy today either, but he could sell?  

No matter what I did to the limits, it told me I didn't have enough funds in my account for the trade!  We put settings on that limit order that would have it close at the end of the day, for just a few dollars, and fidelity wouldn't let me execute, citing ""lack of funds.""

Fidelity has my money, but I couldn't buy this stock today no matter how hard we tried to figure out Fidelity's trading platform, and lack of funds is not the problem I had, but was the error I got. Funny though, once the market closed, my error switched to ""a no after hours trading error"" and not the lack of funds error I was getting. Weird, but ok. 

He doesn't reddit. So, maybe he is trying to pump and dump via me, but I doubt it. He legit wants to see me make money on penny stocks too. He just made some money on HCMC today, but wanted to reposition and couldn't. We were both commiserating over the market fuckery going on right now. But he didn't tell me to spend my time researching this tip and that's how I came across this post. 

I don't currently have a position here, I'll be trying to get one tomorrow. I was trying today, but was unable to, because a ""lack of funds"" wouldn't let me buy today. I was putting less than 1% of my total liquid funds on that order! That bull shit error was frustrating.

Also, someone here did their DD a month ago. And some people, like my friend, have already made some cash, good for them!

All they have to do is prove an aspect of the iQOS vape pen infringed one aspect of the HCMC patent to be successful.  

More likely than not PM will either buy their patent rights to settle.  Years of protracted litigation aren’t worth it if there’s a chance they would lose.  I think this is a settlement play by HCMC.

Much to my dismay, there were 2 more reverse splits in 2019 after my purchase. A 25 for 1 reverse in July (after which I added on 23 more shares) and a 50 for 1 in October. Almost instantly, my money and shares were vaporized. My nearly 3000 shares ended up as 3 total shares worth less than $3.

797,SNDL," First of all, this is move as a whole weed sector moving alone (not specifically any PR from SNDL) by the Fed news yesterday on legalized weed process in 2021 if i am not remember it wrong. So the hype has been started, market rotating from short-squeeze play to weed again now. 

Technically, chart always has resistance but depend on how strong of the volume and all other factors in the market to speculate if it can break previous resistance. From my view on this chart, 1.36 is the big resistance it need to break first for move up higher, and i think it will break it base on hype around the sector and popularity of SNDL ticker among traders. Few weeks back i call it should break 1 soon and it did move up to 1.36, pulling back and hold $1 support well today. We should see this $2 dollar within couple of weeks. Little longer term, we should see this reach $5 sometime by the end of this year. 

Disclosure: sold them all on ran it made on Monday. Scalp in and out a little bit today.

800,PKG," The latest PR release indicated that merger was imminent and it was confirmed that CBBT has already made a significant investment into PKG.

I feel like the risk v reward for this is well worth it, potiential upside just off the back of the merger is huge, not even taking into account the other positives this company has going for it.Obviously the merger could fall through, although that sounds unlikely this far down the road.

I will be holding long term with this, any positive results with the Alzheimer’s device could end up ending this very high, at 0.14, definitely worth a punt in my eyes",JohnsonsMotorCar,23,/r/pennystocks/comments/lbts5w/how_do_you_cbbt_holders_feel_about_continuing_to/glw1ixr/,0.018,0.763,0.219,0.9674

804,PKG, I think its worth mentioning that PKG posted CBBTs latest post regarding the acquisition delay on their LinkedIn profile. I dont really see any reason for doing so unless its was a go.

805,PKG," Agreed, I just sold my SIRC after it ran well over $1 today and going all out on CBBT with the profits, might as well just YOLO this thing.

The way I look at it is CBBT on the market is about to go from no revenue to $16m+ revenue and expanding to 50+ employees, they will have a background in engineering medical devices and with a great concept for Alzheimer's treatment. Once merged and PKG is effectively on the market we're talking about earnings right away and uplist to follow. CBBT will change over night on some random day in the next month or less, I'll take that!

I went deep on the Alzheimer's thing, their approach is legitimate, today there is a surgical procedure done that involves placing Omentum on the brain directly for this benefit, and it in fact works. So if a far safer and long-term medical implant can replace that then this is freaking stupid big.

So TLDR; CBBT has short-term, medium-term, and long-term winning milestones, we'll be trading this one for years.",sneakattack,8,/r/pennystocks/comments/lbts5w/how_do_you_cbbt_holders_feel_about_continuing_to/glw3kmk/,0.043,0.807,0.15,0.9632

One of their VPs is on the way out the door. Not sure what impact it will have if any. One of the upside to OGI is it's not OTC and less volatile, but it didn't get nearly the boost that some other weed related stocks did this week. Invest with caution. It is likely to grow, but price point is probably in the $3-$4 range in the short term.",kraz_drack,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/lbw1j9/ogi_huge_potential_cannabis_legalization_is_just/glwtz3r/,0.02,0.932,0.048,0.4712
