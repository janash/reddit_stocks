0,GME," Yes absolutely. I feel many people should learn about pott odds and bankroll management which are poker terms. It will help them with their risk management.

Your opponent bets $250, making the pot total 3000.  You would have to put $250 in the pot to get a chance to win 3K.
So you'd potentially make 3K on a $250 investment. You can lose this bet 12 times and win 1 time to break even. Y

In poker you made an estimated guess on your opponents hand and figure out what percentage they have to win. If you feel you can win this bet more than 8.33% of the time, if you were to play this exact same hand thousands of time, in the long run you make money, even if you loose the current hand. 

If you have less than an 8.33% chance to win, because you strongly feel the opponent has you massively beat, even if you get lucky and win the hand, in the long run you will loose money by making that bet. The skill is poker is disguising your hand so the opponent guesses wrong, this effectively takes luck out of the long term game and you win or loose money based on your skill at reading hands and disguising your own.

Bankroll management means never putting a huge chunk of money into 1 game, because if you loose or get into a bad luck streak, you can grind to make it all back because being unlucky doesn't last forever and the bad luck will happen multiple times during a career. 

When you make this ""risky investment"" you need to calculate that if you make this same investment millions of times you will earn more money than you lose. This is one of the reasons I invested in GME with a smaller position and didn't YOLO.  I feel the short term is risky, but the long term risk is quite low. The short term payoff is potentially massive, the longterm payoff is high.",Uruk123,22,/r/investing/comments/ok0lfs/would_you_invest_some_of_your_portfolio_in_a_very/h55mlja/,0.092,0.778,0.13,0.9142

https://www.schwab.com/public/file/P-9287115

I have also experimented with using debit call spreads (options) on QQQ vs. TQQQ. Where I had a +40% return on TQQQ, I was getting +200% on QQQ DCS. However, it does not come without risk. If TQQQ is -7%, then you are looking at -30% on QQQ DCS. It may come back or your can lose all of your money.

53,GDP," In fairness, a lot of the gains have been largely due to the fed pumping trillions into the economy out of thin air due to a crisis.

When things took a dive in 2018 it was due to the ""trade war"" and a low GDP growth of sub 2% before covid hit.  Since covid we've gone up significantly due to fed policies, not actual GDP or job growth.

Take a look at GDP vs the S&P.  The economy itself hasn't really grown, but trillions in easy money has pumped the market up.  Taper likely begins at the end of this year and we could easily see another taper tantrum and 0.25% rate hikes beginning in 2022.  I don't know where the rally ends, we could still be up another 5-10% this year, but at some point the fed is going to have to take the punch bowl away.

Many were also expecting a market crash on here in 2016 when it was under $100. Many were also expecting a market crash last Fall when I started buying in the mid $300's.  A lot of people probably missed buying a lot of great long-term winners (whether ASML or whatever else) over the last 5-10 years because of all the people who are oddly eager to indiscriminately proclaim ""IMMINENT MARKET CRASH"" and ""UPCOMING BEAR MARKET"" and then when they're wrong they say things like ""not wrong just early"" (can never be wrong then - just keep pushing back the goalposts.)

I disagree. When a company buys back stock, they are decreasing their cash. That cash could have been used to grow future profits (and was previously priced in to do as such). By buying back shares, the company is reducing its future profits, and thus decreasing its cash flow. This decrease will be balanced out by the reduction in share count, so the per share value will be the same.

The biggest thing in the favor of Petco is that the pet market drastically increased during the pandemic. If you own a pet you probably have experienced longer waits at the vet for appointments or heard of pet daycares not taking new applicants. The pet market has always been growing but there was a large jump due to the pandemic.

https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/delay-pet-care-national-shortage-1.5894161

So we need to determine who are the leaders in the pet market sector. At the moment it is Amazon, Chewy and Petco. Of those companies only Petco has physical stores with veterinary services and grooming services. They also have the membership and subscription services of Chewy which are promoted at the physical stores.

There's really no change in cap gains unless you make more than 1mm/year. If that's your income, I assume you can afford to speak with a tax accountant or FA.

My income is high but that not high enough for me to care that much about the increases in my taxes. Any of the extra tax brackets that I will fall into isn't going to change how I invest or trade.",greytoc,1,/r/investing/comments/ok0ezm/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/h5613cx/,0.018,0.906,0.076,0.7053
134,NYC," If you like the art buy it but I wouldn't buy it as an investment.  The art market is highly illiquid, especially for lesser known artists.  Even if the gallery sells the works for $4000 each, that doesn't mean that you'd be able to sell yours for that amount at any point in time.  You really have to know what you're doing to find artworks that will appreciate more than the S&P 500 for example, over the long term.

Also, there are plenty of junk galleries that sell Picassos and Dalis (I'm assuming they sell prints not paintings by those artists).  By junk I mean the living artists they show aren't necessarily viewed as ""relevant"" in the contemporary art world/market.  I'm thinking of galleries in Soho NYC for example that sell a hodge podge of Op-Art and/or Pop art and/or photorealistic paintings, of the variety that gets hung on a lot of walls but doesn't appreciate in value significantly.",fiveonethreefour,3,/r/investing/comments/ojq5p8/looking_for_advice_on_investing_in_artwork/h53edyl/,0.016,0.93,0.054,0.7427
135,YOU," Pretty soon there will be reverse load funds. They’ll be paying YOU to invest with them. 

That will be the day, right lol?  I said the same thing about helicopter money yet we all have a chinook idling above our homes. Banana land.",XXevilmarketsXX,-8,/r/investing/comments/ojyeq3/know_of_no_load_mutual_funds_does_anyone_know/h54njp1/,0.0,0.867,0.133,0.7184
