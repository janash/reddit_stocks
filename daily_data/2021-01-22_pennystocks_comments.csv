0,AAPL,"1.  Each stock has their own normal pattern of how it trades without PR, news, or pumping.  Most newer people don't realize that and think they've found an easy pattern to follow.  The stock market is a dynamic environment, however with the right tools, is still somewhat predictable.  To capitalize on it, you need to be wired into the news, along with understanding technical analysis (in a non-live environment), and knowing how to analyze filings.  Once you understand the basics of technical analysis/filings/research, then you can actually start trading instead of gambling.

2.  Good advice most of the time...  Belief/hope doesn't translate into fact though.  Set your limits for how long you hold something that's losing money.  If you're waiting for 3 months for a quarterly report and have lost $3000 on a trade during that time, it's more unlikely that you'll make it back or come out on top.

3.  Depends on how you trade, in a very volatile security it's actually important to have realtime data.  You REALLY shouldn't be trading from your phone at all if you're not going the long term investment route, it's very inefficient and will cause losses in the long term.

4.  100%.  I say this all the time, and have it at the end of every post as a disclaimer.

5.  Chasing the newest stock on reddit can be good for short term profits, however like I said above you need to learn the basics beyond just how to purchase a stock.  Understanding the better insertion points for a trade through technical analysis is IMPORTANT, even for a long term investor.  You can buy AAPL at $137.00, but it's heavily weighted by the overall market sentiment so if futures are down, you could be buying at $127.00 instead.  $10 on a 5000 share trade makes a difference...

6.  Understanding risk analysis is key.  Learn it, love it, practice it.  It'll treat you better than your significant other.

7.  Go in with an exit strategy and stick to it.  If you revise your exit strategy it should be done on logic with factual data to back it up.  Chasing a trade is the same thing as chasing that first high for an addict, it only ends in pain.

8.  Do not trade on margin/leverage if you're new or have been in the game less than a few years (in most cases - for some of us our learning curve is parabolic).  Gains can be tempting, but losses can be devastating.  For the seasoned investor, it is a tool, not a means for wealth.

9.  Listen to yourself and your research for your decisions.  You can consider others opinions, but at the end of the day you're going to be the one covering your losses.  It's better to miss out, than to lose profit.

10.  This is a business, treat it as such.  You will have associated expenses for making money.  If you don't calculate those into your plan, you'll end up a** up in the water.

Chasing was my biggest failure at the beginning. Bought ALPP at $4.5 on the end of the hype and then it crashed down. Same with ABML.

Now I'm in with ABML, ATVK, ARB, ATOS, HITIF and TLSS.

But from this sub I've learnt DD is so important. It helped me get out before the big dip (the first dip not the 2nd that was manipulated) with ATVK because I did my DD about what was actually happening in the court case.

My rule number one to sleep in peace is to have this as a smaller portion of my portfolio, it is all money I am willing to risk and lose (and er... a lot of the times they do better than the stable ones but, that’s money I wouldn’t risk and am happy seeing slow growth in).

Second is same as yours - if I’ve done my DD, dips are nothing. If brain says RED, DO SOMETHING - I hide until I see a green day. Thank you hide function....

Third, we set our limits and have hypothesised expectations - if they don’t meet it, then find a good time to say goodbye. Even if my positions don’t get up as high as I’d like, I have learnt to hold and sell at a profit, rather than panic selling (especially at a loss). Trust yourself (if it’s not a hype buy) that this company has value somewhere and just needs a bit of time.

For DD, I just do a basic google and check of their website, social media, main offerings and other spaces that chat about them. One would be surprised at the amount of penny stock people hype up that barely have a functioning page. Those call for constant anxiety because nobody really knows what they put their money into.

Not looking at the phone is hard! Then again, if you have no plans to buy or sell that day then set a time limit, and just stick to your plan. I stare to feel happy at my growing stonks rather frequently, no lie....

In some cases, they may have identified a legitimate advantage, but these cases have a short life-span. In general, the market will discover and correct for these opportunities. 

The critical problem with TA is that it is not forward thinking. It can only generate a profile of the past. For myself, my firm, and most commercial traders and investors, this renders TA almost useless. I'll grant an exception to HFT/algo based institutions, who have the resources to capitalize on instantaneous changes, but the vast majority of traders, especially in this subreddit, do not have that ability. 

Of course, you should consider my opinion with a grain of salt. It's possible that I am biased, since mine and my organizations system does not rely on TA, yet it is still wildly successful.

I do not waste time on company financials and technical data or chart patterns over the past month or even 5 days.

If it has gapped 45% has 1 mil, i look into it.  If it has a low float of 5% or less and news, it goes on my list.  If it gaps 45%, has a .84% float, 500k 10 day volume average and is at 1.5 mil, with a market cap of 200 mil, it is at the top of my list.  Then i start studying the premarket chart pattern.  Establish a base entry and exit plan.  At opening bell I watch for a trend, compare it to premarket, decide a revised entry and exit ""if need be,"" then buy the first dip.  Sometimes I have to buy the second dip if i have not decided on an entry and exit.  I do not set a stop loss.  the gap stop stocks are very volatile.  My stop loss is my brain.

For that alone, I think it's worth putting something down and seeing where it goes. For example, ABQQ's new movie is out today in China and was apparently trending on Maoyan for a little (kind of like a Chinese IMDB with 60% market share of the online ticket market in China), so who knows what'll happen. 

Maybe it'll be a success that sets up more movie releases and major gains for all of us lol

Recovery Factor = portion of oil to be extracted. Simply put, there is a lot of oil underground, but you have to pay certain amount of energy to gain that oil. Once you reach that optimal point, you stop drilling and close the wells.

They operate Europe's largest hard-rock lithium resource, and they're located approximately 100 km NW of Prague, on the border of Germany. Now, why does this location matter? It places them strategically in the middle of the largest EV and chemical manufacturers in Europe, which is the second largest EV market in the world, and growing. These companies include Tesla, Porche, VW, and BASF, among others. 

During their recent investor relations, European Metals disclosed that they would be making their first partnership announcements during Q1 of 2021. Q1 ends on March 31st, which is only 68 days from now. 

Before theorizing further, let me preface by stating that European Metals is a long-term hold for me. Regardless of the near term price action, I will not sell a share of this company for at least 1-2 years, and perhaps longer. 

How can we theorize a short-term trade? There are likely numerous ways to do this, but let's consider Piedmont ($PLL) as an example. Like European Metals, they are an emerging lithium resource company, but they're located in North Carolina, among a much smaller market. In early October of 2020, they announced a five year sales agreement with Tesla, to supply their United States based factory. Since this announcement, $PLL has rallied from $11/share to $48/share, despite the fact that their resource is non-operational. It's my belief that European Metals will make a similar announcement during Q1, and we'll see a similar effect.

Oil futures ended higher Wednesday for a second straight session, as traders penciled in expectations for aggressive pandemic aid spending by the administration of President Joe Biden.

“Markets are filled with enthusiasm for a new policy era, and oil markets are no exception,” said Bjørnar Tonhaugen, head of oil markets at Rystad Energy, in daily commentary. “The Biden administration is not only seen as the beginning of more political stability in the U.S., but also as the catalyst for a generous relief package that will create more economic activity and more demand for oil as a result.”

“More spending means more money changing hands, more transport and more products,” the Rystad analyst said.

[On Tuesday, Janet Yellen](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/yellen-to-champion-bidens-economic-plan-at-confirmation-hearing-live-blog-2021-01-19), the former Federal Reserve chair and Biden’s nominee to be U.S. Treasury secretary, told the Senate Finance Committee that the government should “act big” when it comes to fiscal spending aimed at boosting the economy as it attempts to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic.

West Texas Intermediate crude for February delivery [**CL.1,** **-1.09%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/future/CL.1?mod=MW_story_quote) [CLG21](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/CLG21?mod=MW_story_quote) rose 26 cents, or 0.5%, to settle at $53.24 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. March WTI [**CLH21,** **-1.05%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/future/CLH21?mod=MW_story_quote), which became the front-month contract at the day’s settlement, climbed by 33 cents, or 0.6%, to finish at $53.31 a barrel.

March Brent crude [**BRNH21,** **-0.98%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/future/BRNH21?countryCode=UK&mod=MW_story_quote), the global benchmark, rose 18 cents, or 0.3%, at $56.08 a barrel on ICE Futures Europe.

“The calculation is simple: increased fiscal support means more growth and higher U.S. oil demand,” said Eugen Weinberg, commodity analyst at Commerzbank, in a note.

Biden has [proposed a $1.9 trillion spending package](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/bidens-stimulus-checks-and-tax-credits-would-send-a-windfall-to-americas-poorest-families-heres-exactly-how-much-11611099387), which faces a tough battle in a 50-50 Senate where Democrats will have control by virtue of Vice President Kamala Harris’s tiebreaker vote.

Most of the gains for oil can be attributed to the “expectation of stimulus money,” said James Williams, energy economist at WTRG Economics. However, “in a longer term view, there are factors which could go either way.”

“A ban on fracking on federal lands would have a negative impact on U.S. production which is positive for oil price,” Williams told MarketWatch. While on the downside for oil prices, Biden is “more likely to be softer on Iran and a lifting of sanctions is possible. That puts more oil on the market and downward pressure on price.”

**Meanwhile, the oil market is likely to remain in a supply deficit over the first quarter and the rest of the year thanks to a surge in demand** in the second half of 2020 as economies began to recover from the coronavirus pandemic along with disciplined compliance with [OPEC+ production curbs](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/in-gesture-of-good-will-saudi-arabia-to-cut-more-oil-output-as-russia-kazakhstan-bump-up-production-11609875109), Weinberg said.

“It is true that the higher oil prices in recent months have led to increased exploration again,” Weinberg said. 

Weekly data on U.S. petroleum supplies will be released a day later than usual because of Monday’s Martin Luther King, Jr. holiday.

The American Petroleum Institute will release its report late Wednesday, with official figures from the Energy Information Administration to follow Thursday morning.

On average, analysts expect the EIA to report a decline of 2.5 million barrels in crude supplies for the week ended Jan. 15, according to a survey from S&P Global Platts. They also forecast supply increases of 2.7 million barrels for gasoline and 600,000 barrels for distillates.",0.073,0.818,0.109,0.9628

They also forecast supply increases of 2.7 million barrels for gasoline and 600,000 barrels for distillates.",0.073,0.818,0.109,0.9628
