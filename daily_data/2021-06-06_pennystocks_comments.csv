47,AC," Valuation based on its competitors is excellent!!! Here is a real estate analogy that I like to use. Imagine considering making a real estate investment and the investor inspects the foundation of the house, the plumbing, the electrical, the heating/AC, the roof etc. All of that is smart and should be done but even before doing all of that if the 3 bedroom house is being sold for three million dollars and all other 3 bedroom houses in the area are only worth five hundred thousand then for the most part most investors would know to quickly move on and not look into the plumbing the electric the roof etc. But if that same house was selling for two hundred thousand then the time spent validating the structure of the house makes sense because the investment opportunity is sound from a financial standpoint. With penny stocks there are great gems that go unnoticed but I think a lot of times investors think that because a stock is at 10 cents it potentially presents a better investment opportunity but in those circumstances the valuation is even more critical simply because a five cents move downward can cause a 50% drop in value. But if the investor knows that 10 cent stocks is truly worth 20 cents then it’s undervalued and even if the price of the stock drops to 5 cents the investment decision is still sound and the investor would be justified in either waiting for the stock price to appreciate or averaging down, (exactly what would not be justified if the underlying stock was only worth let’s say 2 cents or lower). I hope this helps. Again I like what you are doing because when your system is complete you will have developed a framework that helps make your decision making much easier.",Effective-Phase-6575,2,/r/pennystocks/comments/ntfgpk/im_creating_a_stock_scoring_system_for_penny/h0slgok/,0.018,0.776,0.207,0.9964

All our DD since 12/2020 can not be all wrong;

ATOS managed to have 3 direct offering within 3/4 months, which is unheard of;

ATOS halted a critical P2 of Endoxifen for Breast Cancer about a year earlier, which is also very exceptional;

ATOS asked for extra 325 Mil AS (vs existing 123 Mil) which showed how good they felt about P2 Data of Endoxifen, and this was also kind confirmed by the way Dr. Quay talked about ""having a nice P2 package to talk to big Pharm ..."" in the Presentation at the Investor Summit Conference on 05/18/2021;

All the smart money behind 06/21 and 07/16 calls and the 10 HFs (each invested $5 Mil for off PPS at $2.88 in late 03/2021) are controlled by some very smart and greedy pro in investment, I would not believe that they could be fooled by anyone!

On 05/19, all 6 ATOS employees exercised all their available options at $2.90, Dr Quay - 1.90 Mil SH, Kyle - 0.85 Mil SH, others - 50,000 SH;

A smart scientist like Dr Quay would never bring someone that important to him into a embarrassment in case P2 of Endoxifen is not good!

Also, since ATOS is not going to present the P2 Data at ASCO this year (06/04 - 06/08, the only reason could be under quiet period for a BO/Partnership), this led me to believe that the probability of a BO/Partnership is 95%+.",AllSeeingEye7,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/ntcgq4/the_loungedaily_plays_june_06_2021/h0sxd3s/,0.047,0.83,0.123,0.9681

The fact that Dr Quay brought back Dr Chen (10% owner of ATOS in 2009) recently as a Dir of ATOS is definitely a good sign too. They might even be married by now. A smart scientist like Dr Quay would never bring someone that important to him into a embarrassment in case P2 of Endoxifen is not good!

Also, since ATOS is not going to present the P2 Data at ASCO this year (06/04 - 06/08, the only reason could be under quiet period for a BO/Partnership), this led me to believe that the probability of a BO/Partnership is 95%+.",AllSeeingEye7,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/ntcgq4/the_loungedaily_plays_june_06_2021/h0sxd3s/,0.047,0.83,0.123,0.9681

Alex has the biggest OTC following on Twitter I believe.  He has a ton a good picks but he tweets a million times a day and doesn't always do the best job explaining picks.  Worth a follow though.

Otherwise he won't post a DD as reason, gaining more attention on the stock, share price will gain, the DD poster will gain as well. Because it's a penny stock, low market cap most of the time, little volume will drive up the share price.
