1,AI," Stock markets have historically gone up exponentially. So, the saying that stocks only go up is pretty much true. There's a huge cost to not being in the market over long periods of time

With the development of AI, we are on our way toward another bubble similar to the dotcom bubble. Things like autonomous truck will have incredible market value, and the initial hype surrounding such sectors will be even higher than what their value will be. AI will affect almost all sectors of the economy, it'll be a huge transformation. Note that when we'll be at the top of the bubble, the AI sector won't be at its peek of maturity. Financial markets will always precedes the real economy, because they are based on expectations(https://i.imgur.com/VtiDM8j.png). 

To aide the bubble formation will be the nonsensical 2% inflation targets that's obsessing Jerome Powell. When there is a lot of technological driven deflation, like there has been in the last few decades, prices are meant to go lower. If you don't account for that type of natural deflation, you're going to create too much money in your crusade to reach a 2% inflation target. This is what's happening, and this is why assets are inflating more than consumer goods. This is going to continue because Jerome Powell is totally clueless. The continuation of this policy will give ammunition to the bubble formation.

Michael Burry is right about the huge upcoming inflation of assets. Cathy Woods is right that the bubble stocks are just starting to grow. Jerome is wrong about seeking more inflation.

We aren't yet in a bubble, but it'll come in the next few years. This is my prevision. https://i.imgur.com/kYhDi6Y.png",Holos620,65,/r/investing/comments/lujnvo/sp_500_since_1950_graph_showing_all_crashes/gp6vzdx/,0.025,0.891,0.084,0.8424

5,EV," For me, one of the bigger concerns is that everything seems 'harder better faster' (to borrow a phrase from a newly divorced French duo).

So for example, I can see that market 'crashes' / 'corrections' / 'retracements' (whatever language traders use to mask the fact that investments are tanking) will happen faster, more frequently, then recover probably just as quick (or just cycle between sectors).

This unfortunately is a bi-product of faster access to information, low interest rates, retail being able to trade options / on leverage super easily.

Think we've already seen in the last 12 months, the average daily move of S&P is just *far* too much of an outlier compared to historical averages.

My 'control' stock markets (vs the test of S&P/US) are the DAX and UK FTSE - which I know have their own fundamentals / trading terms - but it's still interesting to see over past 2 years.

7,GDP," I have a problem with the average 8,22% growth rate. Not that it hasn´t been, but that whether it would persist.

How has the nominal GDP growth been for the period? In my understanding, capital growth has globally surpassed economic growth for a long time. Which, in my opinion, can really come from increased leverage and decreasing cost to finance that debt.

A lot of capital has entered the market, and I don´t mean just because of lax monetary policy, but because everyone is putting their money into the markets. Almost every single person around the developed world has a pension fund account. Everyone puts their money in the markets, often unknowingly. As more capital searches for returns, the real returns have to come down in the end.

15,FL," It absolutely will IMO. 

Back when covid first happened I was talking to my sister about what I expected it to do and I said then I expected it to be the single largest driver of inequality in our lifetime. Any time you have a downturn like this there are larger then normal opportunities for investment if you have the money to do it. I imagine a lot of people on this sub made a lot of money in the last year. 

That’s not wrong, or dirty or anything else. 

But many who lost their job and aren’t invested in the market are in far worse shape. The stimulus helps but you can’t hand out enough money to bring people back up to the level of financial security they would have had if covid hadn’t happened. It’s hurt the lowest earners the most, and will continue to for years to come I imagine. Same with regards to education of all ages. Remote learning is better then no learning but every study I have read points to students underperforming in person learning by a dramatic amount. I expect the psychological impact is going to end up being even higher in the long run in terms of delayed development of social and emotional aspects of children. 

All of which makes me cringe at the lockdowns that some states have imposed. The two I have followed fairly closely are CA and FL. Florida has largely remained open throughout all of covid and k-12 has been in person since late last year while CA has been the most locked down of any state in the US. Yet in terms of virus numbers CA has had more cases then Florida per 100k residents and while the death rate in CA is a little lower it’s not by that much. 

I expect when it’s all said and done we are going to look back and say that the states that locked down paid a price far, far higher then most even imagined as possible while places like Florida had slightly more covid deaths but created far less inequality and damage in the long run. Florida also has the second highest percentage of population in the US over 65 so their covid deaths being a little higher then CA actually makes sense and isn’t necessarily indicative of their strategy “actually” resulting in more deaths since we know that older populations have a higher mortality rate. 

IMO if you look at the actual data which the cdc website does a good job of providing it’s hard to argue with the numbers Florida has been able to put up while largely remaining open. I’m going to be watching closely over the next few years what the difference is between the poverty and inequality gaps of Florida residents vs CA. I suspect the difference is going to be stark. 

In terms of a solution the only one I know of is to vaccinate as many people as possible as fast as possible and get people back to work and their “normal” way of life. It’s going to be a long and slow road back financially though for many of the lowest income earners and I honestly don’t see any feasible way to “fix” it. A min wage increase has been talked about but a dramatic raise there seems like it will just throw gas on the inflation fire we are all already looking at which again will hurt low income worse then high income since more of their earnings go to pay for the basic necessities like food and housing that will bear the brunt of the inflation spike.",dolphan117,57,/r/investing/comments/lujnvo/sp_500_since_1950_graph_showing_all_crashes/gp6xcji/,0.094,0.833,0.073,-0.937

- World War 2 and World war 1
The world was constantly in conflict and there was much less free trade overall due to the tensions. In fact, UK was the super power during this period not the US. Alot of issues in general restricting the development and growth of human society. Since US emerged Victorious after the war, they had established themselves as a super power, built a global financial hub, established USD as the world trade currency etc. There was a structural shift from UK > US, and UK couldn't do anything to stop it, hence the decline of the Pound. The world (I hope) has learned from its mistakes and would refuse wst by all means. Governments have better things to take care of like raising the standards of living for their citizens!

20,GME," I think what frustates me the most is that these people have been forwarned about their risky bets, but somehow still find a way to rationalize their gambling issues. Eventually, things work out exactly the same way that they were told it was going to end but they put up excuses as to why their plan did not succeed.

Think of the GME saga. Everybody told them exactly how GME was going to end but new retail investors kept FOMOing believing that they were ""sticking it to the big guys"". When they were left holding the bag, these retail investors started coming out with these nonsense stories about how ""ThE MArKet is RiGGeD!"" or ""THe MEdia Is LyiNG!"". No dude...you entered into a risky bet and you ended up in the losing side. Tough luck. This is terrible for them in the long-term. These people genuinely believe these conspiracy theories and will keep rolling from one bad decision to the next. Getting into riskier positions and blaming others when they keep losing money. 

Meanwhile, research made by economists and psychologists suggest that events which people experience very early in their investing life has profound long-term effects. Ie. People that experience very strong negative effects like the Great Depression or the Global Financial Crisis of 2008, conditions people to irrational long-term investing decisions. Americans who started investing at the top of the Great Depression refused to buy stocks all the way until the 1950s, despite multiple well-run companies having P/E ratios in the low single-digits.

Meaning that California covid deaths are most likely under reported while Florida’s are not. Or if they are, they are under reported at a lower rate then California’s.

43,GME," It is not dude. Brokers prohibiting buying a volatile stock because they are not able to post collateral to the clearing house is not market manipulation. Also, not all brokers restricted buying of GME. There was nothing stopping you from creating an overnight account with another broker and buying shares there. Short-squeezes occurs when the shorts try to cover their positions and they keep causing the price to increase which triggers other shorters to cover even more positions. There was no restriction on Melvin Capital or any other shorts from buying GME to cover their positions and thus continue the short-squeeze.

This was a good ole classic pump and dump. The sooner people realize this, the sooner they can release their bag holding stress and move on with their lives. I am afraid people who bought into the GME squeeze to infinity narrative  have a hard time dealing with facts.

NJ experienced a much slower uptick than FL last summer despite being the densest population state in the country. Florida surpassed NY for total cases back in July, when NY was in the midst of locking down.

Texas also locked down at one point, which likely slowed the spread, so even if you're comparing the two because of pop density, you're still not making an apples to apples comparison. Your view utterly lacks nuance.

We do have evidence Florida is not counting excess deaths. I did edit my post to say CA is likely undercounting their deaths. While I find fault in your logic, that is that the discrepancy can only be attributed in CA to undercounting, I didn't say that isn't the case. 

Since you may not have seen my edit, I'll reiterate some of it here. CA likely has undercounted COVID cases and deaths. Technical glitches and incompetence have been cited in the past, though there's no evidence of intentional misrepresentation the likes of which can be found in DeSantis' behavior.

>Im not trying to shy away from Mrs Jones credibility, I just don’t find it worth spending a lot of time on since neither of us have any way to prove whether she is or isn’t telling the truth.

I know DeSantis hasn't been entirely truthful, which should lead you to question his state's data, though you refuse to. But without even being proven to lie, Jones doesn't pass the smell test. Yeah, you're not selectively and arbitrarily assigning credibility.

> To me she seems like a disgruntled ex employee

She was fired for the very same questioning of the data. If she had been fired prior to saying anything you might have a point. But this just shows how you're selectively choosing to view the course of events. 

Which is only one way Florida is undercounting cases and deaths. 

>who jumped on social media to make claims that she couldn’t actually prove.

She's been maintaining her own dashboard of COVID related deaths and cases ever since. Seems like she's doing an awful lot of work to prove her contentions. Being a disgruntled employee may suffice as an explanation for such devotion if you really need it to. 

>And who no other news organization has been able to confirm as being accurate, and given some people’s hate for the Florida governor I think we can reasonably assume that some people have looked into it fairly closely.

This is just more reaching on your part. She has the data she uses on her website. This is such a bizarre narrative you're constructing, she can only be truthful if a news story you've specifically read confirms the data Florida is obfuscating through manipulation has been done so, even though it's, I dunno, being manipulated. Or that the news hasn't been more concerned with her door getting kicked in? You really must be narrow to concoct a story that events must fit in to while entertaining no alternatives. 

You even said in another post her claims ""haven't stood up to scrutiny"" and here you're saying you don't believe her because no one's bothered to scrutinize. It's clear you're making this up as you go along, determined to believe the Florida gov't and disbelieve anything to the contrary.

>NJ I haven’t tracked closely so I can’t comment on it too much. When I started tracking numbers I chose TX, FL, and CA because they were all highly populated states with large dense cities.

>All these nonessentials were open with minor “alterations” to meet minimum definitions by Texas to become essential.

The anecdotal bubble you live in means nothing. The gov's orders are a matter of record, just as it is in FL, and saying the two are essentially the same is disingenuous at best, which is the point you're willfully overlooking.

>All covid statistics are directly correlated with heart and lung underlying conditions, which are more commonplace in states that opened up more.

52,FL," Do you really feel that Texas and Florida’s covid response policy is different enough that they don’t deserve comparison?  They were two of the earliest states to open back up and have been widely criticized for most of the same reasons. And in terms of both infection rates and deaths per 100k they have trended in very similar lines. 

I didn’t say anything about whether Florida being truthful or not was relevant. I objected to your saying my opinion was “irrelevant”.  Not so much objected as found it amusing I guess. 

My intent wasn’t to ignore any avenues of potential undercount in Florida, it was to use excess deaths to look at whether it’s likely that there is a significant undercount for any of the reasons mentioned or any other reason. Unless total deaths are being under reported which seems unlikely then it would seem that while an undercount is possible it unlikely to be dramatic and probably less then the undercount in CA which makes using the cdc numbers as a guide to compare the effectiveness of covid policy reasonable when comparing FL to CA. Both numbers are probably off as any grouping of stats for something this large are bound to be but I don’t see any reason to think they are so far off that they should t be used.

If I had spent more time on it certainly could have crunched numbers from middle of last year on and used NJ and NYC, it was just easier to use the ones I did and figure the total duration of covid. 

It’s certainly your right to believe my conclusions wrong and spurious but I have yet to see you actually provide data that supports the Florida numbers being off in a meaningful way. Your hanging your hat on the allegations from a lady who was fired who says she was fired due to data, the state says that had nothing to do with it. 

I can’t prove who is lying and telling the truth but I do know that all it takes is a social media account to hop online, say outlandish things, and have a lot of people take it at face value. I’m very curious how she is able to keep an accurate dashboard on case loads and deaths without having access to anything more then public data. Where is pulling numbers from?

And I think you misread my post.

**Hocus POCUS, the rise of Point of Care Ultrasound (POCUS):**
Over the past decade Point of Care Ultrasound has had significant growing support to the point where it is now mainstream in the medical field and likely to become the standard of care in several fields (cardiology, hospitalist, emergency medicine, critical care (my field). What POCUS is is the use of ultrasound by the physician at bedside (hence ""point of care"") without the use of a tech or a radiologist. These exams are often question oriented and limited in scope compared to a formal exam, but the quickness makes them effective. 

Sudden low blood pressure? I can tell if it's a heart problem by looking at the heart (is the left side squeezing enough? (heart failure), the right side squeezing enough (pulmonary embolism), squeezing too much or the main vein (IVC) collapsing (needs fluids)?

Sudden low oxygen levels. Is there too much fluid in the lungs (pulmonary edema), is there too much fluid around the lungs (pulmonary effusion), is there air around the lungs (pneumothorax)? 

Legs swelling, is there a DVT (validated 2 point DVT test)?

OK, so it's useful, how many people are actually going to get trained?

Some medical schools are buying all of their students POCUS units. (example: https://www.mobihealthnews.com/news/north-america/uc-irvine-medical-school-gifts-butterfly-handheld-ultrasounds-its-whole-class). 

I finished my fellowship last June. One of the paid benefits of my program was that they covered the Society of Critical Care Medicine's 2 day ultrasound course for the fellows. Every year at the annual Critical Care Congress convention (SCCM CCC) there are more and more sessions discussing the use of ultrasound. Over the next 10 years POCUS units will likely be as ubiquitous as the stethoscope. 


**But why handheld POCUS over traditional POCUS units?**

So there are basically 2 types of POCUS units. Portable ones that looks like a gigantic slab or laptops and hand held units like BFLY (or GE Vscan or Clarius). The larger portable ones are, in general, easier to use because of the larger screen, offer more analytical options, and provide better images. The portable ones are... well.. portable. I'm not dragging a huge thing on wheels around with me. They also take longer to turn on and start using compared to BFLY's iPhone app. Furthermore, most hospitals are not set up for POCUS in terms of documentations. For BFLY, once I complete a scan it automatically uploads to their cloud... from where it's easier to copy and paste into my notes instead of using a flash drive to move the image from the larger machines to the computer. 

**Why BFLY?**

To be honest, I have only limited experience with other hand held units... namely an older GE VScan. The image quality was terrible. Compared to the larger units, BFLY's system uses a proprietary chip based system instead of crystals and their software allows one probe to replace what's normally 3 probes. Hence a $2000 system ($2500 if you want to include an iPAD or smart phone, which is required) is now replacing a $30k+ system and $3k+ in probes. The traditional probes are... expensive and easy to brake if you drop them. Hence the chip based technology is going to provide a pretty nice moat that isn't available to the other companies. Alternatively it can also provide an acquisition target. They list 28 separate patents for their Butterfly IQ+ platform. (https://www.butterflynetwork.com/patents).

* They produce battery anode and are vertically integrated with the highest grade natural flake graphite deposit in the world - giving them a significant cost edge over the current leading providers in China.

* They're strategically located in the E.U. (the world's fastest growing EV market)

* They're partnered with Mitsui ([rank 6 in Fortune's Global 500](https://fortune.com/global500/2000/mitsui-co-ltd/)) - a leader in mining and battery supply chains

73,IRM," [Talga Group](https://www.talgagroup.com/IRM/content/default.aspx) and I don't think it will take 5-10 years.  I think it will happen in 3.

Few reasons I'm so bullish on them:

* They're currently a small/mid cap company ($341M), so they only need to reach a $3.4B market cap to 10x.  Compare that to Lemonade (a $7.1B market cap would need to reach $71B cap to 10x).

* They produce battery anode and are vertically integrated with the highest grade natural flake graphite deposit in the world - giving them a significant cost edge over the current leading providers in China.

* They're strategically located in the E.U. (the world's fastest growing EV market)

* They're partnered with Mitsui ([rank 6 in Fortune's Global 500](https://fortune.com/global500/2000/mitsui-co-ltd/)) - a leader in mining and battery supply chains

* They have an extremely [impressive list of investors](https://www.talgagroup.com/irm/content/top-20-shareholders.aspx?RID=295).

All of the rest are in China (theres one in Australia and I think Korea or Japan might have one). The rare earth material they mine will only get more expensive and more in demand. It’s used in 90% of electric vehicle motors. It’s also used in missile defense systems, submarines, fighter jets, smart phones, wind turbines, and other advanced tech. To MPs benefit, China is becoming more difficult in exporting it. They recently announced that the government can decide to ban the export to countries with competing militaries (I.e. United States and Australia). There fore, in the middle of the pandemic there was BIPARTISAN support for and approved the RARE act. I want to hit on that again. In the middle of the pandemic when congress couldn’t agree on shit, they passed a bill specifically supporting MP and giving them money. Now president Biden’s infrastructure plan specifically supports rare earth mining because if China bans the export, our defense industry manufacturing stops. So, if you believe that electric vehicles, high tech defense systems, electrification industries are going to grow then the rare earth elements (REE) will grow  at the same pace. 

One current kink the plan. MP currently mines the raw REE and then sends it to China for refining and building the actual magnet. The plan is for MP to build their own refinery and with Congressional support, they are being given money to do it. Once they build it, they will be printing money. They will cut all of the cost of shipping it to China and will be able to refine REE from any other REE mine that opens between now and then.

IAG I'm looking at a 6x growth if they regain all Covid losses.  Can then grow to 10x over the next 5 years with expansion into budget airlines (which they are doing with their latest purchase). They just need to break into the far East Market and India as that is where the most growth will be.  As Europe combats climate change in its own.  

RR was diluted to fuck.  But they are working on all electric flight,  small nuclear power stations and rockets.  They are backed up by massive defence contracts, and have been suppressed due to their main business (jet engines) collapsing due to covid.  A strong recovery and expansion into nuclear energy and space will allow then to 10x. Especially with share buy backs instead of regular dividends.  

They have a new CFO as well,  just to add that in.

What's going to lift PINS to new heights in my opinion is when they start diversifying their operations. Like Facebook, they'll need to innovate and enter new ventures in the industry of ""social.""

Demand for plant-based meat is growing, and with deals with some of the biggest chains in the U.S. and globally, BYND stands to benefit.

Just announced partnerships and ""preferred provider"" status for McDonalds and YUM (Taco Bell + KFC). That is huge, and has not properly been accounted for, IMO.

They already have deals with Pizza Hut, Starbucks, and Dunkin, to name a few chains. They also recently formed a joint venture with PepsiCo to develop and release a new line of products.

I also fully expect they will continue to ink deals with big players. I anticipate companies like Dominos, Subway and others to make big moves into the plant-based meat space in the coming years, and I anticipate BYND getting a meaningful % of that business.

Once restaurants are fully reopened and their partnerships with those massive chains come online, their food services revenue, which has declined YoY due to restaurant closures, will explode, IMO.

105,ASA," For me it's a firm called Rec Silicon, it's listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange but has the major operation in USA and a stake in a factory in China.

They are a producer of silane-based, high-purity silicon materials. Historically they got the stick from China who put a 57% tariff on their product and when Trump started the trade war it didn't help with the negotiations. They were forced to close their factory in Moses Lake but their factory in Butte is delivering positive EBITDA.

With Biden there's a change in US politics and REC is situated in the middle of all of this as their product is both used in Solar Wafers and silicon components and it looks very promising that the next battery technology is going to use Silane as a material. USA are going to create their own renewable value chain and I do believe REC is going to be the one to deliver to it. 

18 months ago the main owner of Rec Silicon had to sell 25% of the company because of liquididty problems. The buyer was Kjell Inge Røkke who got it for next to nothing. Røkke is a huge industrial developer in Norway and a personal friend of Bill Clinton since the time he saved and turned around Philly Shipyard to a profitable shipyard.  Røkke moved REC into Aker Horizon porftolio, where the goal is to create a full chain of ESG companies, they are doing carbon capture, Windmills, Solar and Hydrogen  to name a few things. Røkke also went to the bigger funds and banks and raised USD 150 mill in a  private placement valued at 10.8 NOK.

The last development is that Røkke demanded to switch out the board and beome chair leader, he didn't have time to wait til May so it's happening in extra ordinary general election Thursday the 4th of Mars.

With Biden there's a change in US politics and REC is situated in the middle of all of this as their product is both used in Solar Wafers and silicon components and it looks very promising that the next battery technology is going to use Silane as a material. USA are going to create their own renewable value chain and I do believe REC is going to be the one to deliver to it. 

18 months ago the main owner of Rec Silicon had to sell 25% of the company because of liquididty problems. The buyer was Kjell Inge Røkke who got it for next to nothing. Røkke is a huge industrial developer in Norway and a personal friend of Bill Clinton since the time he saved and turned around Philly Shipyard to a profitable shipyard.  Røkke moved REC into Aker Horizon porftolio, where the goal is to create a full chain of ESG companies, they are doing carbon capture, Windmills, Solar and Hydrogen  to name a few things. Røkke also went to the bigger funds and banks and raised USD 150 mill in a  private placement valued at 10.8 NOK.

The last development is that Røkke demanded to switch out the board and beome chair leader, he didn't have time to wait til May so it's happening in extra ordinary general election Thursday the 4th of Mars.

The only other company he's a chairman in where he actually is doing business is Aker ASA which is the umbrella company. Why the rush? He's a man that makes things happen and when he smells business he goes for it.  


They haven't restarted the Moses Lake plant yet, but Group 14 and Violet Power are moving in next door and they need what Moses Lake produces. Time will tell but I've gone all in on this bet.

115,LMND," I’d be cautious of thinking of Lemonade as a 10xer. Just my naysayer opinion so supports your claim that there must be ppl naysaying! Lol 

First, it’s ultimately a traditional product given a jazzy fin tech spin. Not like a new scientific or technological innovation. There isn’t the same room to do a Tesla-like ascension into the stratosphere. 

Second, 10x would mean basically the size of two Allstates today. I don’t see how that’s possible when all the stodgy competition is also investing in massive transformations to compete with these new upstarts. You are right, it will take Allstate a lot more effort to transform than it did for lemonade to build from scratch, but they (and others) are trying. Separately, LMND has 1mm customers; Allstate has 16mn yet market cap is 7B vs 35B. Based on these valuations, the current LMND valuation is baking in some significant growth assumptions (note did not look in detail at their financials so maybe LMND has other things going for it but this is just my surface level review). 

Third, the more different products they get into, the more risk there is for them as insurers. Ultimately, insurance pays out. And when those disasters occur, they will be no different than other insurers who have sustained disastrous hits. 

Anyhooowwwww. I am not poopooing LMND as an investment. But I don’t think it has a 10x possibilities in 5yrs. But I don’t really know anything and sold Tesla in 2015 ;p",featherfactor,5,/r/investing/comments/lu6i2t/investments_you_own_that_you_believe_have_the/gp6ihir/,0.075,0.883,0.042,-0.8901

Lemonade isn't even an insurance carrier and will never see profit the likes of traditional carriers. In order to do so, you have to take on underwriting risk. Unless they plan to massively devalue shareholders in the future by raising capital, they will never turn any reasonable profits as assets are too low and re-insurance costs too high.

It's a tough barrier to entry.

They are more of a digital insurance broker that happens to also be the TPA paying the claims, due to minimal retained exposure, than they are a carrier. There are 1000s of digital brokers, most running with 30% EBITDA margins.

198,CGC," I think it’s very possible for them. I view covid and the race to cure it a little bit like the space race in terms of how fast it accelerated technology. 

I think there are risks with gene editing that lots of sci fi movies have been made about and you know that places Russia and their ilk will certainly explore the darker side of what might be accomplished. But moderna wrote the vaccine in two days. Two freaking days. Obviously it takes a lot more then two days to get that kind of product to market but if it’s possible to write a vaccine for covid in two days what are they and others going to be able to do over the next 5 years?

I think we are going to amazed at the leap in medicine over the next 5 years. 

In terms of other stock I like I think CGC is well positioned for the long term. Love what their ceo is doing in terms of consolidating the company and making it profitable which they think they can achieve next year. They also have a deal in place that as soon as it’s legalized here in the us at the federal level they buy out a us company meaning they have instant US footprint and can expand there already hopefully profitable business here.",dolphan117,2,/r/investing/comments/lu6i2t/investments_you_own_that_you_believe_have_the/gp671m8/,0.014,0.839,0.147,0.9856
199,SV," I work in the genomics field and never heard of them. Just did a quick search and looks like their product is in detecting large structural variants (>30kb for indels), so basically a modernized version of karyotyping and FISH on a chip? Seems helpful for a small subset of cases where SV are the cause for cancer, but I would think an assay that measures genomic differences on the basepair level with a panel that is at least on the Mb scale would have a greater impact. This is just my first reaction though, I'll need to read up on their relevant publications.

In terms of genetic mapping though, it would be a potentially great product to compliment either short- or long-read sequencing, so they could provide a technology that would support more standard genome sequencing",indie_hedgehog,51,/r/investing/comments/lu6i2t/investments_you_own_that_you_believe_have_the/gp4pkmj/,0.019,0.838,0.143,0.9555

203,EV," For the longest time, I didn't believe hydrogen would ever be economically feasible.

I never thought about hydrogen-powered planes. From what I can tell, that's a valid use-case. Maybe huge ships, oil tankers, etc as well. Still not sold on hydrogen cars (never will be as cheap as a pure EV, \~20% less efficient), but hydrogen semis *maybe*.

As a means of storing renewable energy, hydrogen might make sense. Excess solar during the day, use that to make some hydrogen, use said hydrogen power overnight.

List goes on. How to value that all, it's hard to say. ExxonMobil is leading oil company, $250B market cap now. Hydrogen will only take a small slice of the green energy market, maybe 10%? I don't see them growing into $50B of revenue which they might need to 10x the share price. $5B, $10B, sure. It's already priced for most of that.

On the other hand, strictly on hype - if they can go from the $100s of millions of revenue to something like $1B next year, $3B the following year (>100% annual growth), it could get some pretty insane P/S multiples. Maybe a P/S of 100, 200% Y/Y growth, and $3 billion of revenue and you have your 10x.

Bull: The sausage was well seasoned and the si-.......oh right about the company. I think this company has great potential.

Plus for their stock price, shit....it's low risk potentially VERY high reward.

Bear case: Competing with a big boy like BYND is pretty rough since they have been such a big player in America....honestly the only big player for years. Although their product is good, plant based meat I don't actually think is the future, I think it is a gateway to the future. I don't know a single person, even vegans and vegetarians, that eat plant based meats. I only bought it to try their product and will I buy it again? No, because the price point isn't there and I would rather just eat a vegetarian meal. I would really like to see fast food chain partnerships with them. That. Was. Fucking. Genius. It was THE best way to get people to eat plant based meats. Put it in something that people already don't care about the quality or taste much, and cover it in veggies and condiments and show them it tastes damn similar while also having health and environmental benefits? Win win win win win. The problem is other companies already have these partnerships so is there enough space? I don't know.

Although their product is good, plant based meat I don't actually think is the future, I think it is a gateway to the future. I don't know a single person, even vegans and vegetarians, that eat plant based meats. I only bought it to try their product and will I buy it again? No, because the price point isn't there and I would rather just eat a vegetarian meal. I would really like to see fast food chain partnerships with them. That. Was. Fucking. Genius. It was THE best way to get people to eat plant based meats. Put it in something that people already don't care about the quality or taste much, and cover it in veggies and condiments and show them it tastes damn similar while also having health and environmental benefits? Win win win win win. The problem is other companies already have these partnerships so is there enough space? I don't know.

Tesla is great but it’s the exotic nerdy pioneer of EV. It’s not what every family in America/Europe/Japan etc are going to own. 

Once this shift starts to happen, we will see money come out of Tesla and back into the big automakers.

257,YUM," To address your two points:


1. What is their moat?

They have just inked a 3 year deal to be the preferred supplier and collaborator for one of the most recognizable fast food chains in the world (McDonalds). And just inked a similar deal with YUM to create plant based products for them for ""the next several years."" They get free advertising in Pizza Hut locations and on their website. Same for Dunkin and Starbucks. They have scale, brand recognition, and partnerships with the biggest players in the space, as I mentioned in OP. Could other players emerge? Is there competition? Of course. But a rising tide lifts all ships. More people are buying plant based meat. The player that is the most recognizable, is in the most grocery stores and has deals with McDs, Dunkin, Taco Bell, Starbucks, KFC, Pizza Hut, etc. and also formed a company with PepsiCo to develop a new line of products, stands to benefit the most from the growth in demand for plant-based meat.

They're also the only multinational vegan food company to have a major production facility in China.

It takes time, money, and products that people like to get to their global scale and brand recognition.

2. Their prices are insane.

If you're talking about retail, they have cut prices in the last year, rolling out bulk options in Walmart. Their retail sales growth was 76% YoY. Will this dip a bit after the pandemic? Maybe, but it will be more than offset by restaurants reopening.

If prices were insane, why would their retail sales be skyrocketing? 

As they continue to grow through inking deals with the biggest companies in the food space, their costs will continue to decline through economies of scale.

If their prices were insane, why would McDonalds, Taco Bell, KFC have just inked deals with them? Those chains will not sell an expensive product, so obviously the price they pay for the product and Beyond's costs will not be ""insane."" Why isn't their a surcharge for Beyond Sausage as a topping at Pizza Hut? As a topping, it costs the same as any real meat topping.

So whether retail or food services, the price is not insane to the consumer and not insane to fast food restaurants. At least according to their sales figures and some of the largest food companies in the world deciding to go with them, rather than the competition.",bob383838,3,/r/investing/comments/lu6i2t/investments_you_own_that_you_believe_have_the/gp6vkzx/,0.052,0.921,0.027,-0.9021

This is a false dilemma. It's not as if you're forced to invest in China/Chinese companies if you decline to invest in a particular U.S. company. 

As for the Cold War comparison, Lockheed, Martin Marietta, and so on were large industrial companies that produced both civilian and defense/military products. Yes, some of their primary products were weapons of war--and maybe that's where you draw the line--but I think it's easier for many people to reconcile their consciences with a fighter jet that is designed specifically to counter lethal attacks from existential enemies than it is to defend a company/product that exists only to increase to the ability of (repressive) regimes to surveil dissident and minority populations. 

Maybe I just lack imagination, but I'm struggling to figure out a non-despotic use for PLTR's services, at least in the way they market them.

289,GME," We have a really simple problem here.  All of us are too busy to be on this sub full time, and it’s grown to the point where nobody pays attention to the rules.  During the GME mess we were averaging a new submission every 45 seconds.  During arch of 2020 a new one every 2-3 minutes. And on a normal day we average a new submission every 6-7 minutes, almost every single one breaks rule 2. I’ve asked for new mod volunteers every single post I’ve made regarding sub rules and have gotten almost no interest - except occasionally from like teenagers with a post history full of rocketships.  So we’ve got two options:

1) let people post whatever they want, and thus have nothing but low quality garbage all over the front page, because the voting system is not an effective determinant of quality. (Seriously, go to /r/Economics or /r/technology and tell me how much of that is legitimately good discussion on economics or technology)

2) work with automod over time, which is pretty limited in its execution, to create enough filtering to prevent the hordes of people who don’t care about our very basic rules rules from posting whatever they want.

305,RH," There are definitely some good mods, in some cases they've had to fight with the Reddit management to keep certain aspects of their subs intact. But we all are individuals at different life stages with our own unique experiences and perspectives and we express ourselves in multiple subtle ways. And most people aren't self-aware. So it's very easy to have some vague rules and then remove posts and comments that may be useful. (again, not talking about this sub, just Reddit as a whole). I'm not making a free speech argument here. Just simple, regular posts.

One recent example is when an r/options mod commented on a post about Robinhood sending tax forms with errors. The comment went like ""I'm going to leave this post up because of its popularity but any robinhood posts should go to r/RH in future"". Lots of people got infuriated and the mod kept making unconvincing arguments. A lot of people on the sub use RH and for those that don't it's very useful info on what other brokers out there are doing. May be I was thinking of switching to RH and probably won't after this, how do you know. This kind of compartmentalization and in some cases, a quest for purity will make Reddit look like the old media.

And guess what r/RH does, they seem to remove posts critical of RH. I don't know if the mods are owned by RH but the higher control the mods have on any sub the higher the chances are for something like that. (I'm sure you're a decent person and this doesn't seem to a major problem in Reddit at this time. But I'm just saying this is how human behavior will evolve based on incentives offered.) A lot of subs have more active users at any time than many highly rated TV shows. So if there's an opportunity to avoid damage to the brand or increase awareness to the brand companies are going to try that, shady or not.

Mods need to be mindful that they're not bots and shouldn't act like one. There's a reason why Reddit didn't automate the whole platform with bots.
They also need to understand Reddit doesn't have a defined real estate. That doesn't mean allowing low quality posts but that means constantly negotiating control vs freedom and also the nature of the post.

In different aspects of life, people are given different sets of power, like at work, politics or parenting and many people that exercise the power badly don't even realize that, that's the problem. The only solution is to allow yourself some flexibility and context and not come in with an enforcer mindset. I just feel like the current Reddit model doesn't allow that because of multiple reasons whether it's mods becoming overworked, or the process of how you become a mod.

307,GME," Having s serious conversation about GME I believe is well tolerated here, unlike WSB.  I have had a number of interesting dicussions on GME, such as why GME shareholders should be writing more covered calls.  However, the discussions on here have been much more substantive and I think those of us who found this forum appreciate not having to deal with market insanity, like wanting to harm hundreds of millions of people around the world by collapsing the market.

I think the mods have done an admirable job given the scope of their responsibilities, but that is just my 2 cents, which is worth a penny.

313,CEO," Agreed with your analysis on spring lumber prices surging. I have been keeping my eyes on some other key factors in the lumber industry.

Looking to the future it looks like their should be a surge in lumber supply. You correctly pointed out in a comment below that the lumber industry works in cycles. Lumber companies are NOTORIOUS for their ""Take it all while we can"" attitude. Harvest it all while the prices are good. Side note: It's actually terrible for the environment and I would like to see regulations.

Back to the point.  Why their will be a fall-winter ish crash this year. Every company is harvesting as much wood as they can and sending it to the market (Flooding supply). Also, Europe is forecasted to be slapped hard by the spruce bark beetle this year, forcing a tonne of salvage logging (flooding supply more). Furthermore, British columbia and Alberta are still experiencing moderate Pine beetle outbreaks and will be salvage logging from the previous outbreaks (more supply). Scientists in Atlantic Canada have observed ""massive swarms"" of spruce budworm moths prepared to assault the eastern Canadian provinces, even more salvage logging (and you guessed it flooding supply). 

On the demand side of things everything is so uncertain. The housing market is predicted to maintain low interest rates through 2021, and people will continue to build country homes. 

My bet is on the demand for home improvement lumber types. Specifically Cedar (Cedar decks, patios etc. fancy stuff). Interfor specializes alot in the Cedar harvesting (in their West Coast divisions not so much southern states). Cedar has seen a very high demand increase as people have been stuck at home and want to improve their homes with cedar products. However, by fall-winter 2021 the pandemic will be over a year old and people will have already improved their home, plus a possible vaccine rollout so they can finally leave their home and go to the forest to see the Cedar patios in their natural habitat.

Interfor CEO, also announced he would be selling some of his private shares recently. (perhaps because he thinks this rocket is at its peak). 

TLDR: 

I think Interfor is going to go down. I will buy LEAPS Put contracts into Winter 2021 for the price to drop to its price floor of $15.00 so I will set my strike price to $16.00.

I will be graduating soon and I have a contract with interfor also. SO my thinking is. If price go down- I lose my job but win my Put contracts. If price go up, I keep my job and get money that way. I don't see how I can lose. Sorry for the length.",Ok-Dish2183,2,/r/investing/comments/ltzj6a/ignore_the_talking_heads_how_to_actually_invest/gp4idqn/,0.064,0.875,0.061,0.3884

317,CEO," The author's post hits the 'nail' on the head. Q3 and Q4 experienced moderate price increases from a realization standpoint and now in Q1 realizations will reflect $800+ per unit for the entire quarter (for reference RFP realized $600 and $608 in Q3 and Q4, respectively). You can do the math on additional income with only minimal expected incremental costs (they should ship about 500m units). With May lumber futures contracts over $800, looks like Q2 can repeat.

The author briefly mentioned pulp. Search a wsj article on surging pulp prices. Pulp price increase announcements have been plentiful, which is welcome after an absolute dismal 2020. Q4 should be the bottom while Q1 ramps on on realizations. Interfor does not have a pulp division, so they are tied purely to lumber. RFP does have a large pulp division and I expect it to be incremental in coming quarts and ideally will offset inevitable decreases in lumber prices. 

RFP also wrote off $50-60m of underperforming/idled news print facilities in Q4, which hurt their 2020 ratios. They were idled since April 2020 and I think management went with a 'clear the deck' approach to start 2021 fresh (with a new CEO starting in March, who was the CFO). Meanwhile, adjusted EBITDA after that write off was $140m for the Q, on a market cap of $600m at the time (i.e., on pace to make entire market cap in EBITDA on a trialing 4 quarters basis).

Definitely subject to more supply coming on board eventually. But likely a year out for new greenfield construction to start up. Mortgage rates even with the recent uptick are an absolute steal. Housing starts are still low based on the last decade of underbuilding and projections for housing needed. 

I think these producers are good bets. It's astonishing that cnbc had a whole clip on playing the lumber surge and didn't mention a single producer (especially with WFG joining the NYSE in early Feb following a significant acquisition or norboord).

I agree with author, RFP the best value. They traded at $15 in 2018 after the last lumber run (... that only made it into the $600's) and followed that with a $1.50 special divvy. The difference now is that lumber going way higher than 2018 and the other segments not doing as well as they were in 2018, but pulp looks to be making up for that now kwhich will be a nice surprise to the market). Now they also have like 80mm shares outstanding compared to 90mm back in 2018 due to a buy back. I anticipate they could make their marketcap in EBITDA this year and generate a ton of cash. They are shareholder friendly with the Canadian warren buffett as the largest shareholder and his lieutenant as the chairman of the board. Currently less than $10 a share right now, 50% short term upside easily.

332,CEO," Are you saying it literally can’t go tits up? :p

There is always a level of uncertainty when talking about the future. Its hard to see the supply of lumber surge just because more logs are harvested at a larger without a commensurate surge in sawmill production which cant happen unless sawmills are running at less than 100% capacity right now or more are built, which doesn’t happen overnight. 

Lumber will go down after the spring boom but the question is will it crash hard like 2019 and drop to 100-200$ a unit or will it “crash” to 500/600 which still would historically extremely high and result in continued high earnings for the lumber companies. 

It’s harder to say home much more improvement demand will carry into 2021. The average consumer is likely to be more affected by surge in lumber than home builders or buyers. 

As for insider selling at Interfor and some of these other lumber companies, i think a lot of lumber insiders are taking some profits given the last 2 years. But the ones I’ve followed still are holding a majority of their shares. It will be more interesting to see if Interfor CEO dumps everything.

337,RFP," Its a complicated response but ill try to give a few key bullet points. 

First the PE, relates to earnings prior to the record surge in lumber. This play is for the wave that is still coming and not yet realized, not one that already hit. So it wont necessarily be reflected in current PE yet until Q1 earnings end of april. The first half of 2020 was rough for them. Q3 was trending up. Q4 trended up more but they logged some one time “expenses” on their books that actually werent a real expenses that pulled down their non adjusted earnings. This why I focus on EBIDTA for right now. That being said, they are expected to get drastically higher earnings this Q compared to Q4. 

Second, The PE ratio is a little misleading. Its for non adjusted earnings. For a lot of manufacturing heavy company companies, a different way (and i think better im this case) to look at companies’ health is their EBIDTA because they have a lot of depreciating assets that look like costs on their books but aren’t actual costs and have no impact on their cash flow. RFP market cap is like 760 million. They will probably earn that entire market cap this year because of the lumber surge and the wood pulp surge. 

And if you look at what they were making in 2018 when the stock surged to 15, 2021 so far has the potential to be a much stronger year for them as long as lumber doesn’t dramatically take a dump in the next month. 

But for determining a stock’s value, many people have many different opinions. There is no one right answer unfortunately. I dont have a crystal ball. So we’ll have to see.",Ding123456,1,/r/investing/comments/ltzj6a/ignore_the_talking_heads_how_to_actually_invest/gp6t03l/,0.062,0.867,0.072,0.4748

350,UK," We are seeing increases on Tripadvisor, Airbnb, Hilton, etc in the last couple of months. I am expecting the mental factor to be the key to all this. The mental side of this seems incredibly strong. People need an outlet and they've been couped up for a year.

Three sources I consider in this are:

* Social Media - Persistent messaging, memes, posts all directed at the desire to travel, partying, drinking, etc. Influencers professional or just people's mates/family are implying a social obligation/peer pressure to go 
* UK/HK - In the UK and HK people moved around to avoid quarantine areas and nations resulting in a greater spread of Corona. This likely happened just about everywhere as far as I can tell by a casual glean of the news. 
* Dubai - Celebrities and people flooded Dubai as they remained open during the pandemic, social media will show you the sheer stupidity of people to travel/party and need hotels. This resulted in a relatively low population nation to have thousands of cases of corona per day. They are now hurting bad from trying to keep the tourist economy going but there is a demand that will likely only increase as more people are in a position to make the trip due to mass vaccination.

351,HD," I think there's going to be pent up demand if things really do start to significantly improve, but I think people seem to have this view that the country is going to go on some sort of collective Spring break or something after this and the reality is that unfortunately many people are not able to do that. Also, I've noticed that people seem to think that everyone is an extrovert.

Additionally, AirBnB has discussed changes in travel and I don't entirely disagree. You're going to see some return to big cities maybe more in the second half of the year, but I think there's going to be a lot of outdoor travel this Summer similar to travel last year and experiences where people can be separated. RV sales had an unbelievably good year last year and people who now own an RV are probably going to want to get use out of this giant thing they've now invested in. 

""The money they didn't spend on travels last year has been spent somewhere else already.""

There's a lot of that. That's why you saw HD/LOW and other things having remarkable comp store growth last year - money that wasn't being spent on things like travel wasn't being put under the mattress, it was redirected towards home purchases as if people thought they were going to be spending more time at home, they were either looking for a new place (Z,RDFN) or fixing up current one/investing in new one (HD, LOW.) POOL had a fantastic year last year and still strong backlog and with that, every pool is probably going to be a revenue stream for years with all of the maintenance/repair/etc. You're going to start to see things like HD probably have difficult comps this year.

So yeah I think there's certainly going to be pent-up demand for travel but what does that look like especially in Spring and early Summer (still more ""staycation""/nearby/outdoor?) and maybe it starts to broaden in the second half and later in the year.

358,APRN," I think that if one really looked at all of the things that were covid beneficiaries, there's going to be a wide range of post-covid impact.

With Peloton, I think you're going to see backlog shrink, but there's going to be a lot of people who are still going to see the benefit of isolated exercise for a while. If this was a few months that would be one thing, but we're now pushing towards a year of people having to be concerned about hygiene/sanitation and a gym is something they can't necessarily rely on to keep clean. Additionally, Peloton is getting more into clothing and other things, while Lululemon is going the other way and getting into connected fitness with Mirror. With the installed base, there's also going to be plenty of people who have now bought their Peloton and are paying their monthly fee. 

With Pool, you might not have the same degree of backlog, but it's not going to evaporate entirely - you've seen a lot of people move from cities to outlying areas and a return towards normalcy may not change someone wanting to have a pool at their house in general. If there was a massive amount of pools installed over the last year (and probably for a while to come yet), that's a lot of recurring money for the years ahead for repairs, maintenance, etc. Every pool installed is a potential revenue stream over the long-term. I mean look at the long-term chart of Pool - it might not sound like a great business, but it certainly has been for years.

While very different, both of those are instances where you certainly aren't going to see peak demand as things return to normal, but I don't think demand goes away - and the existing asset base in many cases will continue to throw off recurring revenue. Someone might not watch as much TV as things get back to normal, but if they bought a Roku during this, still throwing off some degree of ad revenue.

If there's something that benefited during this where there's recurring revenue and you sold maybe multiple years worth in one year, that's a huge amount of additional assets out there with the potential to throw off revenue, which is compelling imo.

Something I'd be more concerned about would be something like APRN, where before covid it looked like it was on its way out and this crisis significantly increased demand and basically saved it. After the crisis is over and people start going to restaurants again, I can't imagine that doesn't start eventually heading South again. The weakest delivery service (WTRH) that looked like it was going towards 0 before covid might run into weakness again.

Zoom will never see peak demand again and who knows how many people never converted to paid.  Teladoc I think is an example of you're not going to see peak demand, but I think this did pull forward a lot of adoption of telehealth from future years.  Online food delivery (Grubhub/Just Eat) probably erodes quite a bit, more diversified delivery (which seems to be the direction DASH is heading towards) might fare better.

I think you might see some slowing in SQ/SHOP and catch-up in V/MA; I think the last year has been a lot more about retailers large and small looking to equip themselves to sell online (Shopify has said they will see slowing next year) and enable things like buy online/pick up in store, digital payments or other things. V/MA have lagged and have seen impact from things like less travel spending. This year you're going to see some slowing in SHOP/SQ and might see V/MA do better if there's a pick-up in impacted sectors like travel spending. That said, if things return to normal and it's a broadly stronger economy, not a bad thing for SHOP/SQ in terms of broad spending and less concerns about businesses potentially cancelling their service.

So yeah, I think what benefited during this will see demand declines/difficult comparisons to varying degrees (and the stocks will get sold significantly in a rotation which you've seen some lately), but I do think that there are certainly themes (connected fitness, online grocery, telehealth) that were jumpstarted by this where demand will come down from peak levels but you did pull forward adoption by years and demand will imo remain elevated/above pre-covid levels.",dvdmovie1,2,/r/investing/comments/lucbc6/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/gp6v0dk/,0.086,0.837,0.078,-0.6436

With the installed base, there's also going to be plenty of people who have now bought their Peloton and are paying their monthly fee. 

With Pool, you might not have the same degree of backlog, but it's not going to evaporate entirely - you've seen a lot of people move from cities to outlying areas and a return towards normalcy may not change someone wanting to have a pool at their house in general. If there was a massive amount of pools installed over the last year (and probably for a while to come yet), that's a lot of recurring money for the years ahead for repairs, maintenance, etc. Every pool installed is a potential revenue stream over the long-term. I mean look at the long-term chart of Pool - it might not sound like a great business, but it certainly has been for years.

While very different, both of those are instances where you certainly aren't going to see peak demand as things return to normal, but I don't think demand goes away - and the existing asset base in many cases will continue to throw off recurring revenue. Someone might not watch as much TV as things get back to normal, but if they bought a Roku during this, still throwing off some degree of ad revenue.

If there's something that benefited during this where there's recurring revenue and you sold maybe multiple years worth in one year, that's a huge amount of additional assets out there with the potential to throw off revenue, which is compelling imo.

Something I'd be more concerned about would be something like APRN, where before covid it looked like it was on its way out and this crisis significantly increased demand and basically saved it.

Online food delivery (Grubhub/Just Eat) probably erodes quite a bit, more diversified delivery (which seems to be the direction DASH is heading towards) might fare better.

I think you might see some slowing in SQ/SHOP and catch-up in V/MA; I think the last year has been a lot more about retailers large and small looking to equip themselves to sell online (Shopify has said they will see slowing next year) and enable things like buy online/pick up in store, digital payments or other things. V/MA have lagged and have seen impact from things like less travel spending. This year you're going to see some slowing in SHOP/SQ and might see V/MA do better if there's a pick-up in impacted sectors like travel spending. That said, if things return to normal and it's a broadly stronger economy, not a bad thing for SHOP/SQ in terms of broad spending and less concerns about businesses potentially cancelling their service.

Plus it seemed like PLTR was going to keep sliding over the week. I mean $8 every week isn't really pennies right?

Also, I'm not selling options that are pennies. I'm selling options that are over $5 in premium. While not a lot at once, it adds up over the course of a year. Also, options 2-3 months out net more premium than weeklys.

372,CD," Question regarding house downpayment investing and CD's vs bond heavy funds vs index funds:

With current state of stocks and some fear regarding inflation and market corrections I am curious what some folks here may think on this matter.

I'm currently saving for a downpayment for a house in a market that is sadly increasing in price fairly quickly each year. Target price to get a 20% downpayment is $100,000, and our horizon for purchasing is likely 3-4 years, possibly slightly sooner. With house prices going up around 12% each year I feel that sense of urgency all too much to buy something now/sooner while mortgage rates are great and we can get more house for our money.

I've currently been DCA'ing into Vanguard's VFIAX (S&P 500 fund) with the majority of our house saving money in payments twice a week. We also have some in individual stocks (Roughly 10k I play around with and pull out profit), and have a mutual fund with around $15k that's just doing it's own thing and can be used later for covering closing costs. 401k through work is chugging along for retirement and I'll focus more on that aspect after getting a house secured.

Obvious thought is that the index fund carries a lot of risk, especially with a shorter horizon on when I want to utilize the funds. A CD or something bond heavy could relieve a lot of that risk albeit with lower returns, but the returns compared to the risk could be inconsequential all aspects of the market considered. My ""high yield"" emergency fund account has dropped rates so much it seems not worth even considering parking our house saving payments into that.

So, while this is a fairly personal question with my own risk tolerance to really answer it, what are your own thoughts on a CD vs bond heavy fund vs index fund for saving currently, or splitting between multiple to spread risk out?",Bournestorm,2,/r/investing/comments/lucal9/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gp72sig/,0.064,0.891,0.044,-0.7533
373,HSBC," So I am in the UK- currently investing my non-work SIPP pension with the HSBC Global Strategy Dynamic Portfolio C Acc but don’t think the returns have been all that great. The % Return (MWR) since July 2019 has only been around 13% which isn’t brilliant.

I am 37 so have at least 18 years to go before I can even access the SIPP so willing to be fairly adventurous in terms of risk. 

Ideally I want to set it and leave it but not sure if that is wise?

From research, I was considering switching over to the Fundsmith Equity fund but would welcome some thoughts from you far more qualified folk :)

395,ROIC," ROICs mean revert over a given period of time. Companies like $HD and $LOW will end up losing their high ROIC status over time. Why? Because that high ROIC doesn't mean anything if they have nothing to invest that excess cash into and doesn't mean anything if all they can invest in are things that deliver less returns than their high ROIC. At a given point all those companies will hit a ceiling with what they can invest in that will give them higher returns than they can get themselves, unless they want to start doing some risky things that most shareholders would never approve. Anything under their high ROIC is going to destroy value so they have to either constantly do buybacks or issue dividends, both of which have their own problems for shareholders.

With 13000 as upfront payment, you are paying for a contract that worth 50 $* current index value. I think that’s 19050$. That 13000$ is called initial margin. NYSE set the bar to initial margin much higher, it used to be 4000$ before early 2020.  However, rules did not change. If you hit below your maintence margin when a daily reaction occur, you would have to either add more funds to your account or cancel your position completely. Maintence margin is 90% of initial margin. In addition, each fluctuation point brings 50 dollars profit/loss for ES.

405,TV," >	The Apple Car is looking more and more likely to be released around 2024.

I worked for Apple for five years, and this statement is nonsense. You can’t ever predict Apple stuff like this, this far out, because Apple cares more about its product security ecosystem than it does hitting specific target dates.

Just recently, there was a big wave of rumors about the Apple Car, and every auto manufacturer had to deny they were working with Apple. Even if one of them was far along the process, Apple would rather kill the negotiations and figure out the leak, than push ahead with a leaked product.

It seems like you probably haven’t been following Apple for a long time, because they’ve been talking about making a TV since before I left, but it never happens because Apple couldn’t get the content agreements in place.

So, Apple can be very far along w/ the design of something like a car, but then if they can’t get the dealers to agree to their terms, they won’t make the car.

>	If it does, this makes an Apple investment a very smart decision for long-term investors. Let’s not forget that Warren Buffett has half of assets tied up in Apple - why? Because Buffett understands the signs of a successful long-term investment.
