They have done well to make chicken salad from chicken shit but they really need to diversify their offerings into something that can make profits in the medium-long term. If I were running Intel right now I'd be doing something like looking more into RISC-V and buying Sifive and trying to use your expertise to make a killer offering for that platform and targetting low power lower cost devices as well as making an alternative to Apple's current strategy on desktop.

87,IMO," Agreed that reliance on aging x86 hurts - at some point companies must pivot away from their cash cows or get crushed by innovation.

As a chip design and fabrication company (one of the few left in US), Intel still has opportunities to innovate in the NEXT generation tech - materials like carbon, graphene - and newer architectures that can arise out of it (move away from traditional caches/memories). 

I'm reminded of the MHz war and the end of Moore's law with the transition to core count, and now process technology being the dominant gauge of success.

161,AMC," CC are great. But they do inherit some risk and OP was lucky and smart at the same time. 


Simply put:


If you sell a CC you limit your upside. If OP had sold them right when AMC was mooning, he would have lost the shares and limit his profit potential. Which was something a lot of thetagang members suffered.


If you sell a CC you have to hold the shares. If the stock price drops you may keep the premium but you will suffer the loss of the shareprice and will be stuck bagholding.

At which point we can YOLO whatever money that will be on whatever companies are being traded in whatever market emerges.  I already have clothes, a TV, and a bed so I don't need to worry about inflation making me pay a lot for those things again.  A nation of degenerate gamblers is just looking for the next poker game.  There is no Boomer future with a white picket fence and a big lawn for us.  They burned it up and left us as the bag holders.  We would be stupid to keep their racket going by playing along with their old rules.

Nobody cares that the casino is going bankrupt if we can just go to another casino later on.  And that's pretty much all we are dealing with here.  The only people who have anything to lose are the people running the swindle at the top.  We would be doing the world a favor to push this system over a cliff, getting rid of the Fed, and starting over.

Retail wins because retail can always find another seller. Sellers are desperate to find buyers.

344,CLF," I am personally long-term bullish on CLF because it looks like the company is adapting extremely well to the environmental issues that arise with the energy requirements to produce steel. The world is changing and the traditional methods of producing steel are quickly becoming unfeasible, but the company is investing a lot into the ""green shift"", not only by directly building better facilities but also transforming from an isolated mining company to a bottom-up metal production company. I think there is a lot of upside potential for managing their own supply chain and making it more efficient altogether.

I don't also see steel becoming very cheap in the long term, because it requires so much energy. In a world where energy is precious, steel is ever valuable. Anyone who can manage production costs in a good manner will find ways to profit off this and I am long on CLF to be one of those companies. That being said, my personal outlook is a very long term one and could get wrecked by gay bears in any of the coming years up to 2030 because of environmental regulations, which are quite lackluster right now IMHO.",paskaak,14,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o44912/clf_looking_bullish_no_triangles_lines_and/h2fc6fo/,0.014,0.819,0.167,0.9852
345,CLF," Beautiful chart.  Rips, consolidates, rips.   Looks like its consolidation is almost finished.

Why steel is a little bit different:

US Steel and CLF continue to idle legacy plants and are basically refusing to bring that capacity back online.  Lumber, a few old mills have been restarted.

401,HUGE," There‚Äôs a HUGE trade to be had in macro rn. EVERYONE is/has been on one side of the inflation trade boat and we‚Äôre at the very beginning of a major reversal. 

Risk managers will start forcing their trade desks to cut/limit exposure. This will take time to unwind so what we saw last week is not even the beginning. 

If you look at history, whenever we‚Äôve come out of a recession, the market 100% of the time overestimates inflation and has been 100% of the time wrong or way too early. Bond yields always initially spike then fall, often to new lows. 

The trade is long the dollar, short the commodities, cyclicals and after an initial sell-off, long growth stocks (especially ones with network effects).

402,AMC," One of the better higher conviction play I did recently was selling AMC cash secured puts and put credit spread when it had that ridiculous run that cumulated to the +90% day.

Sold Aug 20p and 25p against cash and 10p. Credit of $8+ and $5+ for the spreads.

IV was like almost 400%. The puts were green on a AMC green day. 25p was going for $8.5 while 20p was going for $5.5+. Market was pricing in an eventual collapse.

Anyways as with GME in Jan, no matter what happened the days following, the premiums just couldn't keep up with IV crush as AMC begin to settle in a more modest intraday moves. Even on a -40% intraday move the puts were bleeding premium because it simply wasn't having multiple halts in a day. I closed it out about 4 days later for almost +40%. (7-8k premium from 19k collateral on the spreads).

Anyways those 25p are worth ~$3 now while the 20p are worth only ~$1.7x. IV is sitting at -100% at about 240% (still high).

Aug may seem far away, but as with selling GME April puts back in Jan, baking in an ER allowed for even more premium capture before the eventual IV collapse along with letting the rest of the Greeks do their work. And you can obviously close out the trade well ahead of time. I wouldn't sell stuff half a year away or further tho unless you're actually ok with taking on assignment or spending time defending the trade if it goes ITM deeply.

In an age of meme stock (which actually seems to be abating a bit). Short gamma on far OTM puts seems like the easier play - especially after the run and multiple volatility halts.

(7-8k premium from 19k collateral on the spreads).

Anyways those 25p are worth ~$3 now while the 20p are worth only ~$1.7x. IV is sitting at -100% at about 240% (still high).

Aug may seem far away, but as with selling GME April puts back in Jan, baking in an ER allowed for even more premium capture before the eventual IV collapse along with letting the rest of the Greeks do their work. And you can obviously close out the trade well ahead of time. I wouldn't sell stuff half a year away or further tho unless you're actually ok with taking on assignment or spending time defending the trade if it goes ITM deeply.

404,MSM," Economics is witchcraft pretending to be scientific. You're better off cloud reading than discussing economic theory, friends.

What isn't silly is the assumptions we can make about the people who attribute value to entities and ideas, based on how informed they are about ""value"", ""entities"" and ""ideas"".

Most people do what MSM tells them. The next biggest group does what influencers, public groups and public message boards tell them. We can ascertain what each respective abstraction's degree of informed-ness is, in respect to the zero-sum *game* of economics. *This* information is more valuable than the sum of its parts.

If enough people believe they have a raw material of value, then it can be commodified. The opposite is also true. The dollar *is* a commodity. (It technically isn't, but it effectively is).

It doesnt matter if inflation isn't actually as bad as people think. You aren't betting against economic theories, you're betting against the monkeys and their monkey brains all playing the biggest *game* of ""who gets the food"" in the proverbial concrete rainforest.",admiral_asswank,13,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o41grb/fraternal_association_of_gambling_gentlemen_and/h2g51n1/,0.028,0.85,0.122,0.9241

That deflation, combined with a slowing of housing starts due to construction materials price increases results in a negative feedback loop.

THIS will cause RE to start dwindling, and with no rise in real wages, it will not recover fast enough to prevent spiraling.

So how are the vast majority of Americans going to live?

430,HUGE," if you think stock price reflects reality, please review 2000 and 2008.   
Just because the stock went up, doesn't mean the company will continue to crush it. 

Lots of ""free money"" was printed, which boosted bottom lines, and made everybody look good (the entire market went up, except stuff like Cruise Lines, etc.) 

The problem is, that created a situation of higher inflation by a HUGE amount.   
The past does not indicate the future when you hit situations of inflation at this scale. The problem is, we haven't seen real inflation at these levels in half a century (at least), so you have to go back to half a century ago to see what happens in this case...

Think of it this way: If you're a bank, and you're lending money at 3%, and the money you loaned is losing value at 10%, you are LOSING money.

434,WH," Thanks for your insights, really glad to have a bit more from others, thank you.

The market taper always comes before it's expected though. Fast forwarding the JPow talk, they are walking things back about a year a month. That gives us to about August/Sep before things start getting really ugly. Which matches your Q3 hesitation.

But I'm of the opinion that we should have passed SPY 425 long ago if the momentum was still building.The fact that we keep topping out is serious. Not only that, but the corrections after topping are painful, not organic.

Final note: is the Fed is directly injecting the market. This is unsustainable. The whole thing is a leverage of a leverage with leverage, and everyone is betting that everything else will hold. Much like 2007 and other similar scenarios.

For the sake of everyone's 401ks, I hope it doesn't go, but I'm not sure how they would stop it if inflation really has passed 10% without throwing down some rate increases.

JPow effectively said, ""this too, shall pass"" but there are absolutely no indications that is accurate.

The WH is printing with no concern for the impact. It's gone from money printing to a money river.

In the history of the world, inflation at these levels has never been sustainable.

453,AMZN," Since selling off 1,900+ of their retail locations to Walgreens for $4.4 billion back in 2018, Rite Aid was able to reduce its debt to $3.1 billion.  That remaining debt is being serviced quite effectively.

Last year Rite Aid has positive free cash flow and more that $400 million in EBITDA, to go along with $24 billion in revenue. The company's financial health has improved so significantly, that earlier this year RAD completed a $95 million acquisition of Bartell Drugs, making Rite Aid the #1 retail pharmacy in Seattle. In addition, the company is investing about $200 million in store remodeling per year, which is improving results at each of the refurbished locations by about 3%. If Rite Aid had any concerns about its debt, it could direct the $300 million per year that it is spending in acquisitions and refurbishments to debt retirement.  
  
As such, it appears that the $3.1 billion in long-term debt is being easily serviced by the company, and they‚Äôve been paying down chunks of debt early from time to time.  
  
This year, Rite Aid will turn the corner and have positive net earnings overall.  So the financial health of the company is now quite strong --- so strong, in fact that Moody's upgraded its rating on Rite Aid to POSITIVE from STABLE back on May 13, 2021.

459,BC," There are multiple macro reasons for high likey prices, this large decrease in price is more or less a stabilizing of the supply and demand.

British Columbia mill closures from 2019-2021 has taken millions of board feet of production off the market. This is a function of the increase in wood supply during the mountain pine beetle epidemic that has more or less come to an end. Too many mills not enough supply, likley a few more mills will be shut down in the next year or so.

The wildfires in BC and Western US since 2017 has constricted timber supply. 

The tariffs are very much still in place between Canada and US and are actually increasing at the moment. In markets like this the Canadian producers can pass the 5-25% tariff right to the US consumer. 

Major beetle epidemics in many parts of Europe and Canada, again cause supply issues for timber. 

I'd like to remind you lumber hit record levels in 18/19 then had a bear year through all of 2020 sitting around 300. Likley the new norm will be 800-1000. Many producers were still curtailing mill capacities as covid was starting to do it's thing. With the crazy increase in demand supply was slow to come online again. Costs in lumber yards haven't come down to reflect this as orders were completed at higher costs but many buyers are starting to lock in orders at the current price which will increase demand enough to stabilize. 

I don't see another huge dump or jump. Barring natural disasters. North America needs housing period, the demand is likely to sustain the current prices, supply increases in the US South coming online over the next couple years will likley moderate any wild increases.",treedhuman,11,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o4488t/what_caused_the_price_of_lumber_to_drop_recently/h2fpvla/,0.061,0.897,0.043,-0.6644

477,CO," So here is my question:  What about all of the debt that is being incurred by the people buying at these prices?  I sold my home in the Nashville metro area about a year ago at a premium.  The ‚Äòvalue‚Äô has since increased by over $150k in one year.  It was built less than 4 years ago for almost $500k less than the current value.  Personally, I don‚Äôt see the buyers ever getting ahead in that market where land is readily available and relatively cheap.  I now live in CO.  Home prices here have skyrocketed - locally up 30% y/y in this county.  2,000 sqft get-away 2nd homes built in the 70s are now selling for $1.5M.  Buyers like myself that have cash can buy land and build a home far cheaper than the $500/sq-ft that existing homes are selling for.  Maybe I am missing something but it seems to me household debt is soaring and the underlying asset value is not there.  To make matters worse, many of the homes in this market (CO) are 2nd homes.",AlpineAspirations,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o3y8tf/ccs_the_company_making_a_shit_ton_of_cash/h2g1xnb/,0.059,0.872,0.069,-0.0644
478,ALL," I'm sure there is land mate, but home builders aren't building enough. Sure, their cutting into backlog, but not in any meaningful way so far. For the housing shortage to be fixed in 5 years they would need to build 2M homes a year, but their not building anywhere near that even if their still cutting into the backlog. You remember the lots also have to be readied for building, and home builders have economies of scale, where if you built it yourself you wouldn't. 

New homes are pricier than old ones because 1) everything is new, and 2) There is a warranty for the big ticket repairs for a certain amount of time (at least there used to be). You can see it here: [https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/warranties-new-homes](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/warranties-new-homes) 

As for everything: Vacation homes and WFH homes have been bought like crazy by people who have been able to keep their jobs during their pandemic. These people are largely white collar, with good jobs in tech, finance (etcetera). Because their jobs were secure, but they had to save at home, they got a very nice nest egg through savings. Simultaneously, tech stocks (and the broader market as a whole) had boomed. A lot of companies saw their RSU's value or stock grants value increase substantially, as well as their 401K's, IRA's, and taxable brokerages boom as well.

Factor in record low mortgage interest rates, and you see these people going crazy over vacation homes, and second homes, or homes with a lower COL. 

What happens when there are more than 10 of them? Bidding wars, with things like all cash offers. 

It's not that normal people, who can afford an 3.5% down or 5% down (FHA, VA, etc...) can't compete with the initial listing price. It's the massive bidding wars that they can't compete with, and that won't change until demand matches supply. Those people will STILL buy come 2022 or 2023, but because of the demand-supply imbalance they can't afford to pay ALL IN CASH in an offer and WAIVE CONTINGENCY which is what a lot of people are doing LMAO. Remember an all cash offer is king, and even better if you waive contingencies. Homes are being outbid, sight unseen! 

Add to that is the fact that there are institutional investors who are buying up homes as well, and you get what you see.

481,GOOD," You know this is from Q2-Q3 2020 right? Which is why i didn't reference this. 

But this is fine: You have to understand the largest form of debt, which has been increasing with cash out refinances/purchases is GOOD debt right? This is because home prices tend to appreciate, while your mortgage stays the same, and with each payment you increase your equity. 

Add to that, refinances have lowered monthly payments and you get a good sign.

As for your concern over the broader economy, i touched upon that in my post to you. As for interest rates rising, it should moderate demand slightly, but not anywhere near enough to affect the supply-demand imbalance and the FED is forecasting 2 rate hikes to .75 in 2023 if i recall correctly.

All of my remaining student debt (which is substantial) is consolidated with the federal government.

758,WISH," Keep an eye on my WISH all-in. Got a feeling it's gonna rip pretty hard. If it jumps the way it did a couple weeks ago, I'll set stop-losses to chase its rise and try to ride it up. Reasonable chance we see the price spike and then correct lower, so I'm going to try to time selling higher than the price it corrects down to and then buying back in when it goes back under what I sold it at (if it ever does) to try to pick up some more shares.   


Worst case scenario, assuming the stock doesn't tank right out the gate for some reason, I'm out a bunch of profit but do still end up profiting (it rips, then fluctuates just under my stop loss, then rips again), which I'm fine with. Best case scenario I can increase profit and/or average down if it corrects back under my current price average (about 11.32).   


If WISH tanks, I guess I'll just be chilling all day.

790,CBD," As a farmer and a veteran I like the idea but the problem with the US Hemp industry right now is that there is no infrastructure to sustain the acres currently grown. Hemp has many other applications other than CBD oil but there aren‚Äôt enough places that those who grow Hemp to sell their crop to. I personally know at least 10 farmers who went pretty much bankrupt growing hemp in the past couple years  because they couldn‚Äôt sell their crops. All of these individuals had contracts with various companies to buy their products but those companies themselves either didn‚Äôt fulfill their end of the contract or went bankrupt themselves. I think Hemp has a lot of potential in the future but we are still years away from having the infrastructure in place as well as the demand for the crop to be profitable for farmers to grow it. The bottom line is that this is something I would not invest in. The only way it could possibly be profitable is if they grew hemp to process their own brand of CBD oil and even then it is very risky. Aside from all of the land, machinery, and building cost, the cost of producing an acre of CBD hemp is $10k to $15k. A few acres of hemp will produce a lot of CBD oil. Furthermore a few acres wouldn‚Äôt sustain the cost of all the other overhead. They would have to have a pretty big distribution contract. Anyway, it‚Äôs very risky. You wouldn‚Äôt get a return on your investment for years. That‚Äôs assuming you get any return at all.",Woody56usmc,4,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o48l4t/hemp_investment_business_model/h2fv4lm/,0.079,0.83,0.091,0.5301
