Scaling IS a concern for Tesla, but given their history of improvements in cost, speed, and quality of manufacturing I don't think it's one they'll fail to overcome. 

The only thing that would make me question that is if they can't get their tabless DBE 4680s working well enough to put them into volume production.

29,AI," I agree that a ~25k car is the sweet spot but I don't see how other manufacturers get there. I'm expecting a few to go bankrupt, actually. They might need to sell their EVs at cost or lose money until they can achieve the efficiencies of scale.     Just like other major players in industries that have been disrupted, they just can't move fast enough to keep up. Similar to Sears, Blockbuster, etc... The competition just came too quickly and gained too much edge and name recognition. Tesla is the only company I can see offering a profitable budget car.

All other car manufacturers will have the same issues you've pointed out, too. It's extremely expensive to build or retool factories. Tesla has done both and now enjoys healthy margins on each vehicle made, a healthy amount of cash and debt that is overshadowed by its current growth. Their true moat is vertical integration and their ongoing engineering efficiencies that will allow them to underprice everybody else and keep their lead.

Tesla does currently enjoy a very high valuation but the P/E was cut by almost half in this recent quarter and that trend will continue as they meet their production goals and as their other ventures ramp up.

All in all, this is only the car business. A Tesla play is a diverse play into energy,solar, batteries, auto, and AI.

I know I can't convince you and I guess I'm not really trying to. I'm enjoying typing this up. It gets the ideas out of my head. Tesla has matured as a company over the last ~20 years and they are a power house. A true disruption to many different industries.

31,ICE," Yeah. To be fair I tend to interpret that to really mean they’ll never drive another ICE again. A lot of benefit from Tesla comes from what the EV tech allows them to do. I can see some of these people slipping back to other brands if/when they make compelling ev vehicles. 

That said, it’s the only car that I’m excited to drive everyday, two years after owning it. They really are great.

Going sideways because time is abrasive is the same as going down.

Based on your time horizon (for.most people its 10.years before they die) your break even is somewhere above horizontal. Just like in options for the same psychological reason.

Factoring for TIME, mass psychology's break even is about 9%

Hence the 9% return for the safest possible method of investing.

85,RES," > That being said, increasingly I feel as though Reddit structurally just isn't conducive to substantive, balanced discussion.

I mentioned this elsewhere but that's been a trend over the last few years.  Reddit's path towards monetization is increasing user engagement and selling targeted advertising/data.  This was the entire purpose of ""new"" Reddit - it's the reason why you can do all sorts of shit that I think is strange- like follow people, post things to your own profile, there's a chat feature that I've disabled via RES, etc.

As part of this they're also utilizing their algorithm to throw new subs in front of users all day long - so lets say you post in /r/politics about the economy, you'll eventually have /r/economics as a suggested place to visit.  Then you post there because /r/economics is basically /r/politics, then because you're posting there /r/investing gets recommended, so you come here and start talking about the same mindless shit people talk about in /r/politics and /r/economics.  You probably don't actually have any interest in investing as a subject, but the algo brought you here and you've got some thoughts to offer about how banks are bad or something - so here we are.  

All subreddits that try and maintain a focus on a topic are slowly getting flooded by people who have only a slight interest in that topic, which means everything trends towards being a general discussion forum, which in the reddit world means it's actually just a venue for people to try and feel smarter than each other regardless of their knowledge of a given topic.  There's not a lot anyone can do to stop that -  it's the direction the admins are taking the site, and in a lot of ways it's really inevitable of any modern website.

86,DD," I honestly don't know man, not really in a general sense.  Reddit has had the impact of drowning out a lot of the old forums that were topic focused.  There's a few niche subs but they're not going to give you diversity of opinion.  So like you could go to /r/bogleheads but the head mod there just bans anyone who discusses things outside of indexing, you could go to /r/wallstreetbets but it's almost 80% memes at this point, you could do like /r/securityanalysis - which is a great sub in general but is pretty focused on valuations and individual stocks.  It's also been heavily impacted by the whole ""DD"" craze.  I'm just not sure, there's a lot of weird niche investment subs that are like 6 months old - we get requests all the time from  people asking for their sub to be put in our sidebar, but honestly I don't trust it.  Like why go just set up another sub for investment talk, it feels a lot like these guys are doing it with some profit motive down the line, but I haven't cared enough to look further in to it.


> some good info and DD, but a lot of ""moon"" ""r*tard"" ""ape"" bs, that doesn't really deliver much in the way of information 


Yeah, reddit has always had a problem with people memeing things to death - it would be fine if they kept that in their own subreddit but there's this need to go to every single sub across the site and post the same tired memes.  I remember back in the day when the whole ""when does the narwhal bacon"" thing happened, it was everywhere for like a year then people slowly began to realize how cringey it was to take one meme and repeat it thousands of times.  I'm guessing in a year people are going to look back and realize posting about apes, r**ards, and ""this is gonna moon"" is kinda embarrassing.  I already have seen those terms showing up in what are obvious corporate ploys to drive conversation towards a given stock- but the masses are eating it up.

I have $10k that's currently invested not very wisely.

I'm a total newbie and want to grow this $ as much as possible so that I can become more financially independent from my extremely controlling partner.

Ideally as much growth as possible within 2-3 yrs as I'm desperate to get out, but up to 5 yrs if I have to. 

Sadly there was no Reddit when I was younger and I was never financially savvy, so here's where I'm at:

- 42 y/o, 3 kids 🤪, NJ, USA
- No debt, no mortgage, $2.5k freelance income per month. After expenses, I expect to be able to save around $500~$800/month to invest
- No 401K/no Roth IRA
- My risk tolerance is not that high as this is the only Savings that I have. But I do plan to work for many more years.

- $10k is invested through Schwab brokerage as follows:

40% : SWTSX
23% : VGT
11% : SCHG
10% : PAVE
5% : FXI

The remaining 12 or so % is just sitting there.

I'm definitely thinking of getting rid of FXI - and been eyeing semiconductors.

99,AGI," In short: MAGI is computed differently as it applies for separate tax categories where certain deductions are allowed and in other cases they aren't allowed.

I'm going to assume, in your case, your MAGI is the same as your AGI. 

Let's first determine what AGI is. It is all of your income items (salary, self-employment income, dividends, capital gains, rental income, etc.) reduced by any pre-tax deductions (pre-tax 401(k), contributions, HSA or FSA contributions, student loan interest deduction)

For purposes of contributing to a Roth IRA, MAGI is AGI plus:

1. Income from Roth conversions or taxable rollovers,

2. Any deduction received for making a deductible IRA contribution

3. Student loan interest you were able to deduct

4. Tuition and fees deduction

5. Foreign earned income exclusion

6. Foreign housing deduction

7. Interest from qualified savings bonds that were excluded from AGI

If none of the above apply to you, then your MAGI will be equivalent to your AGI.

When you say $140k pre-tax, I assume this is before any sort of AGI reductions (401k contributions, deductible health premiums, anything else that comes out of your paystub pre-tax).

What it sounds like you're running up against is the phase-out limit. For single individuals in 2021 the MAGI phase-out is between $125,000 and $140,000. If your MAGI is below $125,000 you can make a $6,000 contribution directly into a Roth, no problem. If it's above $140k you've phased out and must first make a non-deductible contribution to an IRA and then convert to a Roth IRA. If your MAGI falls in between $125,000 and $140,000 you will be limited on your direct contribution to a Roth IRA.

How exactly it's reduced is by this formula:

* $6,000 * [1- (Your MAGI - $125,000)/($140,000 - $125,000)]

 If you're using a calculator and its telling you your contribution is $4,000, I assume your MAGI is about $130,000.

In this situation you have two options to maximize your IRA contribution for the year:

1. Contribute $4,000 directly to a Roth IRA and contribute $2,000 a non-deductible IRA and subsequently do a Roth conversion.

2. Contribute $6,000 to a non-deductible IRA and do a Roth conversion on the full amount.


A conversion is essentially a rollover from a non-deductible IRA to a Roth IRA. Though rollovers are more often thought of in terms of ""rolling over"" an old 401(k) plan into an IRA.",FromBayToBurg,1,/r/investing/comments/o7jx53/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/h30975t/,0.029,0.925,0.047,0.802

To hold a fully diversified global stock portfolio you would need to own 80+ positions and then maintain their % of your portfolio which isn't feasible for the vast majority of people.  I am not saying don't own individual issues, I am saying do the work to build price targets and monitor them.  Less is easier.  There are a few fund families with which you can easily create a globally diversified stock portfolio out of 2 ETFs which is a great core portfolio.  After that add on what you are willing to put the work into.  If you have been working 9 years, that suggests to me you have a really long horizon to retirement, so all stock; your goal = capital appreciation is the right approach.

139,IRS," I'm not an expert, but can provide a little bit of help. There are a few ways to fund a Roth IRA, which I've used two (the first 2).

1. Simply deposit cash. There are limits (set by the IRS I think) each year. The basic is $6k for an individual, but this lowers if you have a high income and disallowed altogether over a certain amount (I'm think $120k -$145k range).

 2. You can roll an employer's 401k into a Roth IRA. I did this when leaving a previous employer where they literally sent me a check in the amount of my 401k balance which I mailed into my Roth IRA brokerage.

3. There is another approach referred to as a ""backdoor Roth"" which allows people to exceed the $6k annual limit. Unfortunately I'm not familiar enough with this to provide guidance.

I'm assuming this ""worked"" initially for you because your new Roth IRA brokerage may not have known it was coming from a non-Roth IRA account. I would just contact them by phone and ask what you should do. I'd imagine it should be easy for them to just transfer the stocks back (assuming you didn't buy/sell in between). You'll probably have to pay some transfer fees.",clev3211,3,/r/investing/comments/o7m742/individual_trading_account_stocks_to_roth_ira60/h2zk7iv/,0.032,0.921,0.047,0.6145
140,CSV," You can download CSV files of historical stock data from Yahoo! Finance.  It won't be real-time but it is updated daily.  You can import those into almost anything so it shouldn't be hard to find a TTS tool to read it.

I'm on Linux and I wrote a simple command-line tool to retrieve it by stock ticker.  The URL isn't hard to figure out.  Fisker for example:

https://query1.finance.yahoo.com/v7/finance/download/FSR?period1=1593109175&period2=1624645175&interval=1d&events=history&includeAdjustedClose=true

The stock ticker symbol is the text between the last ""/"" and the question mark.  The period1 and period2 values are the epoch value for the dates in the range of data to return.",jhansonxi,1,/r/investing/comments/o7pjth/looking_for_resources_for_visually_impaired/h30u262/,0.0,0.906,0.094,0.833

147,ESS," Fidelity does something like this with its Equity Summary Score, which essentially compiles the ratings from different analysts (only certain firms are taken into account when generating the ESS) to give the stock a 0.1 - 10 rating.

It's pretty close to what you're looking for. You can also see a history of the ESS for the last 12 months.

149,PLUS," When you hold a call in the money, you don't execute, you sell. You get basically market price, PLUS premium. By executing you lose the premium. If you want to have shares, sell the call and use that money to buy the shares on the market.

Market makers might want to buy in the money shares for their shenanigans. Nothing illegal, nothing shady, no squeezes, just stuff like use a call to cancel a put, and they are net ahead, probably complex advanced stuff like that. Some rich entities might really want those shares and they can maybe use calls to not raise the price on the open market?

150,NAV," Buying direct from GBTC was appealing for the last few years because of the high premium to NAV. You could basically invest the 50k and after a 1 year lockup, sell your ""BTC"" (aka GBTC shares) for a huge premium to the market BTC price.

Nowdays it's trading at a negative premium, so you have no reason to directly invest in it. The decline of the premium is because everyone believes a proper BTC ETF will come soon which should trade on par with BTC price.",vansterdam_city,2,/r/investing/comments/o7rl8w/gbtc_vs_grayscale_trust_fees_trading/h30shb1/,0.071,0.902,0.027,-0.5945

152,NAV," [https://ycharts.com/companies/GBTC/discount\_or\_premium\_to\_nav](https://ycharts.com/companies/GBTC/discount_or_premium_to_nav)

It has traded anywhere from +40% to -20% relative to NAV (aka BTC price) in the last year alone. Your typical ETF trades +/- a fraction of a percent relative to NAV.

You need to seriously improve your attention to detail if you want to make any kind of active investment choices such as this one. Price relative to NAV is the thing I looked at within 10 minutes of hearing about GBTC.

Anyways, GBTC is at a heavy discount right now. It's actually a pretty good time to buy it since BTC is in a bear market and then you also get a discount to the BTC price.

This all presumes at some point GBTC will figure out how to modify the fund structure in a way that allows GBTC <-> BTC conversions, which would allow it to trade equal to BTC NAV.",vansterdam_city,7,/r/investing/comments/o7rl8w/gbtc_vs_grayscale_trust_fees_trading/h30s9yw/,0.025,0.876,0.099,0.8722
