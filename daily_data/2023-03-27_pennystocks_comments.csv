12,AMLX," **CLNN**

**4 analyst issued PTs the past week ($8-15) that are 7x-10x current Price of $1.30**

1) Presented positive results from its phase 2 ALS trial. Based on AMLX recent ALS drug approval- there is a good likelihood of eventually getting FDA approval.
AMLX market cap: 2B
CLNN: market cap: 95M

2) In the past few days, 4 Analysts have issued PTs of $8 - $15 (7x-10x current price)

3) CLNN nanotech drug is a new class and not as easy to asses prior to trial results- leading CLNN's valuation to reflect low expectations.
CLNN's  focus is the use of nanotechnology in the treatment of bioenergetic failure. Cleneâ€™s nanotech is the basis of the companyâ€™s bioenergetic nanocatalyst drug candidates, a new class of biopharmaceutical therapeutics designed to promote neurorepair through â€˜hot wiringâ€™ bioenergetic catalysis and improving cellular-level neurofunctions.

Also- limited shares available to short and rising rate to borrow. Short interest is higher than the 7% currently reflected on sites- but even using this lagging data- effective short float (float actually available to trade) is 15-20%.",InvestorCoast,-1,/r/pennystocks/comments/123fu9g/daily_plays_march_27_2023/jduovqg/,0.053,0.84,0.107,0.8353
