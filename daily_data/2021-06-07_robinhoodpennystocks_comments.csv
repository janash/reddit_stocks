0,ATOS," I'm holding.  As background, my wife works in clinical trials and this is what she told me:  

ATOS just started the endoxifen trial 2 months ago. Announcing results this early on means the results are wildly successful. If results are bad they drag out the trial to try to gather more data which clearly isn't necessary here. 

To quote her verbatim: ""This is going to be a billion dollar drug for somebody.""

Are investment properties considered ""liquid assets?"" Short answer is no, because it can take months to receive cash from the sale.

They had to take on increased interest rates on debt following bankruptcy. When inflation kicks interest rates in the teeth this company won't be able to pay their debt. Chapter 11 could become chapter 7 real quick.
