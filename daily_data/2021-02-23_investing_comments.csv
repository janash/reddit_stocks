0,DD," Market corrections are nothing new and everyone knew that it would be any day now that the correction would start. It's likely that all stocks are gonna fall this week but just like Cathy Woods said, this ain't nothing to worry about. The world is about to change in drastic ways and your precious tech stocks are going to be the winners because the system is being changed. Tech will govern our world and we're getting close to that reality.

5,ATH," A market correction is a great opportunity to dollar cost average buy in to long positions. If you've been actively trading a bit lately, or have cash from options, savings, inheritance, etc. It's a good time to set a purchase strategy to buy periodically on the way down (and up).

Set a horizon, set some value upper and lower limits, pick stocks or better yet use dumb ETFs, and buy on a schedule. You will average the upcoming correction, which is the next best thing to timing the bottom (which is impossible except by sheer luck or insider info for select stocks, or insider info on government/fed actions, etc., but impossible for the whole market and without that info).

One of the dumbest strategies is to simply say buy in $10,000 over the next 2 years, and buy every month on a random date (use a random number generator). There are much more smart ways of buying based on how much the stock has decreased from ATH, etc., but the difference in what you earn may be minimal or it may even perform worse than RNG buying via cost-averaging.

If you think the market will be bear for the next X months/years, as long as you don't set X too short, you are guaranteed to get a good cost basis for your stocks if you randomly purchase regular amounts with some interval over the next X time.

The biggest risk is underestimating X and buying in too much too early^(1). A secondary risk is over-estimating X too much, and having money sit out of the market for too long (opportunity cost)^(2). But the latter is overstates for the average retail investor as long as you are not setting X to be 5+ years and keeping cash floating for a long time.

&#x200B;

^(1) If you set X to be 2 months, but the brunt of the slowdown starts next year, you end up buying in near ATH. *With this risk, you can lose money you own.*

^(2) If you set X to be 3 years, but market correction lasts 4 months, then for 20 months you're buying on the way up and are missing out on gains. *With this risk, you lose money you could have earned.*

You don't know X a priori but at the same time it's possible to set reasonable values and considering value since ATH as an additional metric to constrain it and buy on the way down and up. Once you return to ATH in the future (not within a few days/weeks, thats susceptible to volatility), you can simply go all in with the remaining money, to avoid opportunity cost based loss (make sure market indicators are predicting a stable/bull market when you do so).",Rand_alThor_,24,/r/investing/comments/lqfhuz/technology_stocks_are_crashing_what_now/gog9xb6/,0.08,0.833,0.087,0.1001

31,IMO," IMO some stocks like Tesla and various names (some of which I'm holding) could drop as much as 40-50%.

There really is no good news for tech at this point. Further stimulus will only steepen the yield curve which will push down valuations of most growth tech names. The reopening will also be bad for tech and I personally believe people have been overestimating the amount this pandemic has caused permanent changes in the way people work, shop and socialise.

I've said it for a while, but if you were in stocks like TSLA, PLTR, SQ, etc for some quick return you may now find you could be down for years on some of these names.

I honestly worry for anyone 100% in growth tech names right now, especially those on margin. I'm not saying *this is*, but this certainly *could be* the beginning of a repricing of tech that many of us here have been warning of for a while now.

It's also worth remembering that given the amount of retail participation in these names and the amount of margin debt out there we could see the FOMO of recent months reverse quite quickly into a full retail panic which the larger players will likely leverage to drive down prices to well below fair value. For example, I don't think it's impossible for TSLA to drop 80% if this selling pressure continues for a couple of weeks and retail investors start getting truly nervous about how long and deep the selling could go.

For the time being most investors are probably still up and most retail investors probably have the stomach to weather 10-20% drops. But if retail favs start to fall more than 30-40% imo that's going to be a catalyst for margin calls and panic – at least this is what we've seen in the past when we've seen this much retail participation in markets and investors who are this leveraged.",kriptonicx,1,/r/investing/comments/lqfhuz/technology_stocks_are_crashing_what_now/gogmb92/,0.091,0.81,0.099,0.3927

48,CCIV," Bonds are always being sold just like stocks are. Stocks have the stock market, bonds have the bond market.

Yields are going up because inflation is going up. If you are buying debt, and inflation is rising faster than the interest rate, then you're essentially _paying_ the borrower for access to your money. So bond buyers are demanding higher interest rates right now, causing yields to increase as well.

Then your super safe index investor begins to look at historically high bond yields compared to SPY and it's risks, and decides to invest in bond indexes. This outflow causes SPY and it's components to go lower. Someone that was invested in TSLA will look at how low SPY is and it's relative security, and invest into that. This will lower the price of TSLA, making it attractive to the CCIV holder, etc. 

The whole thing is a feedback loop because this shift into bonds really does make stocks go down, _and_ at the same time feel more risky, causing people to but ""safe"" bonds. This continues until inflation or interest rates go down, stocks go back up, or bonds become overbought, at which point the whole dance happens in reverse.",blitzkrieg4,313,/r/investing/comments/lqfhuz/technology_stocks_are_crashing_what_now/goga5b6/,0.052,0.85,0.098,0.8736

Contrast this with something like Dynatrace (DT) that has ALL of their documentation publicly available. You can go through everything to learn about the platform, capabilities, see how you would configure things, etc. without ever even having to submit your name to someone in sales.

It's not an ERP solution.

It is an ELP (Entity-Link-Property) data suite that competes directly with i2 Analyst Notebook.  It has a mediocre OCR functionality thrown in which allows for mass tagging of entities into the data graph.

It has a federated search which drops over the top of your tech stack / data set and will bring anything into the graph that was defined in the ontology.   Tacked onto that is a competitor to FalconView which is actually OK.

134,EV," OK let's take your Dominos example. Driving is part of delivering a pizza.  You still have to get it to the door.  How does an EV solve that problem?  What about communication with the delivery recipient if there is a problem?  Right now today Dominos doesn't own the cars rather it reimburses at 26-55 / mile.  If we assume that they get 60k miles per EV (remember they don't all get entirely used some get destroyed) and $.35 / mile you are $21k per car.  That's before cost of electricity to charge them, inconsistent usage, insurance, upkeep....  I.E. the current model is much cheaper.    I'm not seeing how automation does much of anything for Dominos.  

Now let's deal with software sales.  Under your theory Tesla and Neo... become like Microsoft's OS business.  They sell car operating system that other car manufacturers want to buy.  They are going to be alternatives of course but they have a head start.  There are 17m new cars sold year in the USA and 76m worldwide.  If we assume that the OS is worth $200 / car that's $15.2b gross revenue for the car OSes globally assuming the $200 is flat (which is unlikely I suspect it will be lower abroad).  Of course Tesla and Neo need to do a lot of work to fit these OSes to cars, unless you are going to assume an Android like model in which case bye-bye $200 / car.  We are going to allow them about $5b in profits from this OS business to be generous.  

Now of course for them to be selling these cars all the other manufacturers need to be making computerized EV cars because otherwise they can't run an OS.  That means 10 years are out.  So let's be more realistic and say 25 years not 10 and I still think that's an incredible stretch.  


This is all in real terms we have $15.2b in gross revenue.  We assumed about $5b in profits to be generous.  And for simplicity I'll assume during the 25 years they weren't taking on debt as they expanded their line of OSes for all manufacturers to keep the $200 price and not let it sink.   These are all real numbers (inflation adjusted) so I'll settle for a 5% real return between now and then.  Note this is, far short of what Tesla investors are hoping for but if I made it larger the price goes crazy low.    A P/E of 20, again high but not insane  for a not growing software industry gives me a net present value of  $29b.  And again P/E of 20 is likely a stretch for the stock with no real growth, serious risk of displacement just paying out a dividend.

What about communication with the delivery recipient if there is a problem?  Right now today Dominos doesn't own the cars rather it reimburses at 26-55 / mile.  If we assume that they get 60k miles per EV (remember they don't all get entirely used some get destroyed) and $.35 / mile you are $21k per car.  That's before cost of electricity to charge them, inconsistent usage, insurance, upkeep....  I.E. the current model is much cheaper.    I'm not seeing how automation does much of anything for Dominos.  

Now let's deal with software sales.  Under your theory Tesla and Neo... become like Microsoft's OS business.  They sell car operating system that other car manufacturers want to buy.  They are going to be alternatives of course but they have a head start.  There are 17m new cars sold year in the USA and 76m worldwide.  If we assume that the OS is worth $200 / car that's $15.2b gross revenue for the car OSes globally assuming the $200 is flat (which is unlikely I suspect it will be lower abroad).  Of course Tesla and Neo need to do a lot of work to fit these OSes to cars, unless you are going to assume an Android like model in which case bye-bye $200 / car.  We are going to allow them about $5b in profits from this OS business to be generous.  

Now of course for them to be selling these cars all the other manufacturers need to be making computerized EV cars because otherwise they can't run an OS.  That means 10 years are out.  So let's be more realistic and say 25 years not 10 and I still think that's an incredible stretch.  


This is all in real terms we have $15.2b in gross revenue.  We assumed about $5b in profits to be generous.  And for simplicity I'll assume during the 25 years they weren't taking on debt as they expanded their line of OSes for all manufacturers to keep the $200 price and not let it sink.   These are all real numbers (inflation adjusted) so I'll settle for a 5% real return between now and then.  Note this is, far short of what Tesla investors are hoping for but if I made it larger the price goes crazy low.    A P/E of 20, again high but not insane  for a not growing software industry gives me a net present value of  $29b.  And again P/E of 20 is likely a stretch for the stock with no real growth, serious risk of displacement just paying out a dividend. 

I'm sorry how do we justify Tesla under your model even if I assume you are right about the future?",JeffB1517,7,/r/investing/comments/lq8liw/why_ev_isnt_the_bubble_we_think_it_is/goflemg/,0.065,0.836,0.098,0.9577
136,TSLA," I think you are assuming that TSLA, Nio, etc being successful at autonomous driving means that their price will go up. Do you have any justification for this? Do you have any justification for buying now instead of buying when they actually sell autonomous cars?

Prospects of earnings 10 years from now are worth half in present value.   


If you are predicting 10 years until the ""true value"" of these companies becomes realized in profits, then you are taking a massive leap of faith that the hype train will continue for an entire decade. The valuations now are hype valuations.

>My main argument: EV companies are currently amazon in their bookshop phase

I don't think that they are amazon. Amazon changed the way people shop. Other than longer refueling the EV does not change the car in any meaningful way. In some ways like refueling it is even a step backwards until the technology catches up. The auto industry has historically been low margin and highly competitive. Add infrastructure that will not be possible to built (like a lot of parts in Africa or Asia) or infrastructure that has to be overhauled (like the UK) to be ready for charging stations and it increases costs even more so.

Also what will autonomous driving add as a ROI? Won't it decrease car sales as buses will be autonomous and become a much cheaper mode of transport?

>Once  full autonomous driving becomes realistic, these companies can lease  their code as a service and basically replace the need for any job which  requires drivers i.e. delivery drivers, truck drivers, taxi drivers.

It will not happen in the next 20 years. I could go on for hours why, but here are 6 quick reasons.

1. **Changing conditions:** The roads constantly change. That might be due to changing weather, construction or accidents. Driving on icy roads is tricky in itself, making it drive autonomously will be even harder. Add different road signs in different countries, right hand and left hand driving and you have tasks that become incredibly complex.
2. **Smooth Driving:** This is something that is hardly ever talked about. I have tried the self driving in several cars including Tesla and it is like driving with a teenager who just had his third driving lesson. It cannot merge smoothly into lanes or accelerate without it having to have the correct distance to the car in front, something that is not always feasible especially when lanes combine. Also how the car approaches stops is just not smooth it will take a while.
3. **Liabilities/Insurance**: Stuff does always happen. Who will be responsible for a crash? The driver is autonomous so who will it be?
4. **Cybercrime:** What happens when cars get hacked? It is a computer so it is not only a possibility but will inevitably happen. Who will be responsible if there are deaths?
5. **Ethics:** This is another hardly talked about aspect. When having people they make split-second decisions. If you have to choose which life to spare, how will the computer choose? Will there be different ethics from different manufacturers and especially in different countries?
6. **Regulatory:** Governments are slow to adapt to new technology. Here it won't be different.

5. **Ethics:** This is another hardly talked about aspect. When having people they make split-second decisions. If you have to choose which life to spare, how will the computer choose? Will there be different ethics from different manufacturers and especially in different countries?
6. **Regulatory:** Governments are slow to adapt to new technology. Here it won't be different.

I think we are in a bubble. In the end they sell cars. No matter if they drive themselves or if they are driven by someone. An industry with low margins and highly competitive. Full self driving won't come since it is technologically extremely hard, and then it won't come due to regulatory/insurance and ethnic reasons. Their current valuations are sky high and don't make a lot of sense. Nio has a higher market cap than Stellantis and Tesla a higher one than most of the car manufacturers combined.

150,IRS," I'm going to poke a quick hole in your thesis. In the US minimum wage for tipped employees is $2.13 per hour (for federal, this does vary by state) and pizza delivery companies in my experience pay 50%-60% of the IRS milage which only really covers a bit more than fuel costs for drivers. Drivers (employees) must also provide their own vehicle and insurance coverages. All of this is huge cost savings over having an actual fleet that would require insurance and maintenance.

Companies like Uber/Grubhub/Lyft/Postmates are even more, imho, predatory when it comes to shifting overhead to the most vulnerable employees, but they have fleets that drivers can rent in the most populated markets. My understanding is that these are like a loss-leader model that ensures the ecosystem isn't harmed by lack of drivers to meet demand.

Not sure I believe companies have enough incentive to build out their own fleets in the delivery space yet. Yet being the key word. If there were laws limiting liability for companies with automated fleets, lower insurance burdens, and/or an all-inclusive SAAS model for renting the fleet that included maintenance, I would absolutely consider this scenario differently.

That would be amazing for sure. I would argue however that if there are multiple companies and a flood of EV's out there in existence, then this will drive the price down for this service. If everyone owns an EV that can do self driving and pickup, using the wages of delivery drivers is not going to be how things work.

>I would argue that the valuations of both TSLA, NIO and other large EV companies is seriously undervalued - I'm not basing this on the number of cars they manufacture nor the effectiveness of their electric battery potential but on the billions they're investing in the development of full self driving automation.

171,UK," ""The main example I've been using for this is Domino's Pizza in the UK - They have about 1126 stores in the UK, let's say they conservatively they hire 5 delivery drivers per store and those drivers on average work about 5 days a week and a total of 6 hours per day (the three hours around lunch and three around dinner) - Let's also assume they only get paid minimum wage - This comes out to a total expenditure of about £80mill per year ($110 mill) for dominoes just based on paying their drivers wages, not countering in fuel or other expenditures that they do also cover - And that's only one company in the UK. ""

In my experience at least, drivers make less than the min. Wage (as tipped workers) + they get a portion of the ""delivery fee"" to cover gas.

172,EV," Personally, I am a big proponent of EVs, but feel that EV companies themselves are far from a sure bet. I will write making the assumption that EV is the future. That's a pretty big assumption. I'm not going to spend time analyzing whether it's true or not - I'm just stating first that it remains an unknown.

Tesla has shown that it is possible to build an EV company from the ground up, but I suspect they are more the exception than the rule. For starters, no matter what kind of car it will be, you're going to need to build a body. This puts traditional car manufacturers who adopt EV technology at an advantage. They can adapt their factories to produce EVs in addition to, or instead of their gasoline cars. For them, it becomes a question of how good their R&D teams are at adding the motors, batteries, and parts in between. Some companies will be successful at this, others not so much. I haven't done the research to make any predictions here, but if there is a winner to be found, I suspect it would be a traditional manufacturer who is capable to adapting and changing, assuming such a company exists.

But it is not just the car manufacturers who can take advantage of the EV market. Once again, I think Tesla is the exception, in that they are doing just about everything in-house. I expect the other car manufacturers will be buying batteries, electronics, and all the other components from companies that already specialize in these things. That is another market, or several markets to examine.

Finally comes the charging infrastructure. This one I find harder to predict. Most people who buy an EV will install a charging station at their house. Personally, I don't expect to see any new markets from home charging -- the technology is relatively simple (most of the smarts are inside the car), and can easily be installed by an electrician. The bigger market is the charging networks that will be installed outside of people's homes. Tesla has a large network, but their model has been to use it as a way to sell cars - so far as I understand it, they are not putting any real effort into monetizing their charging network. Eventually, I think someone will accomplish this, but that won't happen until there are significantly more EVs on the road. I think this may be a market to look out for, but I don't think we can yet predict who will be leading the way with charging networks, or their payment models, or some other aspect we haven't figured out yet.",JoeyJoeJoeJrShab,1,/r/investing/comments/lq8liw/why_ev_isnt_the_bubble_we_think_it_is/gogexj4/,0.018,0.879,0.103,0.9903

179,EV," I disagree. When people look at growth potential in EVs they disregard some key considerations that put companies like Tesla that market to individual consumers at a disadvantage in the future:  

1. With driverless vehicles, unless consumers behave irrationally, we will almost definitely all stop owning cars. With enough scale, you could order a vehicle anywhere (including outside cities unless you’re extremely isolated) and could go from place to place cheaper than your current net automobile ownership. You will never need to park the vehicle, and you’ll never need to maintain it. As long as you can get a vehicle rapidly and reliably, it’s hard to imagine consumers resisting that change.

1a. This means that large service providers will operate commercial fleets. Currently, personally owned cars depreciate due to a combination of age and use. The age component is pure waste. But with commercially owned vehicles operated constantly and maintained by professionals at regular intervals, these cars would never sit around, would be utilized constantly, would barely/potentially never depreciate from lack of use.

1c. Remember too that EVs usually have direct drive transmissions and a motor with no moving parts. That makes them, by design, usually way way more reliable and durable than ICE cars, especially if battery swapping is easy. So now you have a more durable car being used more efficiently and isn’t experiencing anywhere near as much waste in its life cycle and depreciation.  

All of this means that the optimally suited vehicle producer will be vertically integrated and control supply chain through maintenance. That last part is key. You have to capture the revenue stream from maintenance, or figure something out beyond just selling cars, because ultimately, less cars will be bought over time and they’ll break less. These commercial vehicles may be more expensive than comparable retail models due to the demands inherent in their use, but given their life cycles that added cost won’t be some gold mine for auto manufacturers. Will there be winners? Yes. Will the automotive industry by net vehicle sales as a whole shrink? Almost definitely. People are just running around thinking any EV company will be bigger in a few years. That may be true in the near term, but once the automation you’re talking about kicks in efficiency will go through the roof and everything will be restructured. The only question is how rational consumer behavior will be, but even then, irrationality may be hemmed in by policy because the implications are so massive.  This is also a time for me to remind you: building cars is hard. Companies like Tesla still have quality problems. Rabid consumer cults overcome that (and that doesn’t make them special-Alfa, Ferrari, MG, Mini-plenty of companies make unreliable cars that people love) but it is absolutely unacceptable in a commercial setting.  

Also, when major societal shifts post implications at this scale, they’re all unique, saying it’ll be bigger or smaller than the internet doesn’t mean much-but it is estimated that full automation will free up billions, maybe over a trillion of hours for people a year. That’s pretty significant.

197,EV," EV is not autonomous driving technology. Electric vehicles will disrupt traditional auto markets and probably wont bring in more money than the auto industry. That said some of the current players who adapt will hang on to their market share. 

EV companies investing into driverless technology can break the market, 100% agree, but that innovation hasnt been realized and we dont know who will be the market leader and win that race yet. I think that autonomous vehicles will require complete overhaul if our infrastructure to accommodate them outside of highways and present a larger challenge to engineer than many assume. With such large hurdles to overcome I have no idea when autonomous vehicles will hit the road.

That said when it comes to investing if you think you know who will be a frontrunner for autonomous vehicles, that company will be a game changer if they can license out their technology, IF we see the technology realized in the next 10 years.",jpow_nudes,1,/r/investing/comments/lq8liw/why_ev_isnt_the_bubble_we_think_it_is/goi3liz/,0.017,0.904,0.08,0.8625

206,EV," EV won't be as big as the Internet, but combined with self-driving cars there is a lot of potential to really change some industries.  Shipping/delivery and public transit really come to mind.  It could also spur the upgrades to smarthomes and home renewable energy generation and storage.

213,EV," To add to your bear case, what is the time frame? Because I don't think it is as soon as some people think.

Short term, we're probably going to have a travel boom, once covid fears have died down and vaccines have been distributed. People want to go on that vacation they put off last year. Is that travel boom going to happen in a world of autonomous EVs? Electric planes? No. It's going to happen with the cars already sitting in the driveways and parking lots. It's going to happen with the planes that are already on the runways.

Mid term, when does Domino's, trucking companies, etc. replace drivers with automous EVs? They can't do it right now, you still need someone in the car. You'll probably need someone in the car for at least the next five years until the technology is better. Then when the technology is good enough, when does it become legal, acceptable, and widespread? For example, the tech to replace cashiers is there, and cashiers still exist. How many companies are going to want to be the first ones to reap the ire of having no employees? How many are going to trust that the robo car is keeping their product safe from theft, etc.?

Long term, absolutely there's going to be an EV revolution. But just like Microsoft in 1999, it's probably priced in for the most part. Microsoft was absolutely a huge shift in home computing, business computing, the way we live in general. But if you bought it in 1999 at it's peak, before the bubble burst, it was 15 years before it hit that price again, for this very reason.

238,ICE," I just generally have issue with the framing of the point (so apologies to you and OP for being pedantic).

Saying 'the internet' is like saying 'blockchain' or 'AI', and are not therefore actually comparable to saying ""EV Companiess'. However, I think given the context of the subreddit and the OP's analogy to Amazon, I will instead interpret it as 'EVs in 10 years can be a bigger deal than Amazon.' *(Even still, I think the label of ""EVs' is far too narrow.)*

In a really basic napkin math situation to value a company that 'solves electric self driving robotaxis':

* Consider the ARPUs (average revenue per user) of a typical apple customer and their electronics (iPhone, MacBook potential, and services) Based on a user buying an iPhone, lets just say $1000/3 years, making it about $330/year for an iPhone user or $27.5/mo. Consider your personal expenditures to Apple (if you are a customer) how much is that likely to be for a typical customer in monthly terms? Now consider that Apple captures most of the profits (through their software competitive advantage) due to high gross margins. Apple is worth \~$2T today in 2020 dollars.
* Now consider an electric self driving robo-taxi network. We know that costs per mile for these are fractions of what the same trip would be as a human driven ICE vehicle. (lots of sources out there on this, not going to link)
* What would the ARPU be for a user of an autonomous taxi network? Likely, I would estimate that it would be reasonable to presume that total spend can be roughly equal to what people pay for their transport today, or less, usually $100s a month or potentially $1000/mo in transport costs depending on where you are in the world.
* I believe it is reasonable to presume that whoever solves this first, will deploy their solution in a way that maximizes profits and they are likely to be in a monopoly or oligopolistic market. Therefore, whoever solves this could likely be benchmarked as a roughly magnitude greater than Apple in todays dollars.

Given that the likeliest scenario here is demand constraints on delivering the autonomous electric vehicles, yes it would take time for this to actually supplant alternatives. However, the flip side of this also means you could likely fully utilize your fleet of vehicles for price wayyyy higher than the minimum required, leading to gross profit expansion.   


How 1/10th the cost? Approximate cost breakdown:

* Energy/Fuel is 1/4-1/2 the cost - electricity is much cheaper and EVs are more efficient
* Maintenance is also 1/4 the cost, much fewer moving parts and service requirements mean most replaced items are tires and windshield wipers
* Depreciation is 1/4-1/8, EVs and ICE vehicles even today are roughly the same magnitude in cost, with EVs being about 50% more being safe. But the kicker: an ICE vehicle is end of life at 150k-200k miles at best. EVs? Are looking at 600k miles easy and 1M mile/1.5M+ km for the vehicle *including the battery pack* is what we will start to see.
* Lower insurance rates as driven by safety numbers
* This not even accounting for the taking out of the driver of the equation...

270,AI," I did, because I think based on how things are playing out, just like with other applications with highly complex software solutions with network effects (ex. Google with search, YouTube for video, Facebook/other Social media, Microsoft with Windows OS, etc) the tend to monopoly or monopoly like structures and pricing. 

  
You assume that once someone solves it, it will be easy for others to solve. I tend to be skeptical of this assessment (Note: I am in software as an industry). Given it will be an AI solution dependent on the quality and volume of the data and its iterations, the data part is the moat that prevents others from easily replicating such a solution.  


Margins will be high for a while mostly due to the sheer magnitude decrease in costs by delivering autonomous electric rides to replace all the Uber/Lyft/Taxis services today. Let alone being in a potential world where people stop owning cars because it is literally cheaper to ride share everywhere than to own a car that sites in the garage 96=98% of the time.

The problem with autonomous cars is that they are unlikely to be fully self-driving for the foreseeable future.  Plus, while EVs are less polluting than ICE cars, they still require sizable resources to construct and are vulnerable to shifting demographic trends.  If cities start banning vehicles and focusing on bike lanes/mass transit and if the population continues to consolidate in large towns/cities, then there might be less demand for EVs.  Also, truly autonomous cars might further depress demand- why buy a car if you can just rent for an hour?

That's simply not true. Look at their earnings numbers and do the math. Yes they're less profitable without them, but they're still profitable. And analysts expect them to get a lot more profitable in 2021 if you look at their estimates.

Also, the fact is Tesla earns more EV credits for each EV they sell, they aren't simply being handed them for being a car company. So saying you shouldn't count the EV credits is just cherry picking to get the results you want.

321,EV," Tesla dropping 50% would put it around $355/share. That is really undervaluing Tesla’s future potential at that point. It’s basically making the assumption that Tesla fails to grow as fast as the EV industry despite their plans to grow faster than the overall EV industry. And it’s also ignoring all of their other lines of business with energy, software, autonomy, etc.

I estimate that the EV market will be around 15 million vehicles in 2025 (compared to 2.14 million in 2020). If Tesla fails to grow as fast as the overall market and its market share erodes from 23% to 20% rather than growing like Tesla is pushing so hard to do, and if their average vehicle selling price declines from $55k today to $35k in 2025, then their revenue would be about $105 billion, or a revenue CAGR over 5 years of 27%, similar to today’s top growth stocks that trade near 100 P/E. If we assume a 10% net margin and a 100 P/E, plus 5% share dilution per year, I get to a share price of $741. Using CAPM and Tesla’s beta of ~2, we get a proper discount rate of 15% for Tesla, meaning a fair value for Tesla under this scenario is $368. Note that I gave zero value to Tesla energy, software sales, or autonomy. 

In sum, I think Tesla declining 50% would be totally oversold and undervalued based on the future potential.",32no,2,/r/investing/comments/lq0p2b/tesla_dip_discussion_thread/goe7hxz/,0.041,0.853,0.107,0.9069

367,PS," It is very simple.

When you buy a house as investment, you planning to return your investment in 20 years, 

For example the house you want to buy cost you 300,000 

Average earning return (rent rate after the taxes and other spending, repairs every year and etc. ) is 15,000 per year or 1,250 per month. - This is earnings. 

Average rent rate before the taxes are revenues. it maybe 24,000 per year, or 2,000 per month, just a rent without spending and taxes.

So your PE (price to earnings) is 300,000/15,000 = 20

And your PS (price to sales) is 300,000/24,000=12.5

PS is not so interesting you, because what is important is how fast you return your investment, and this is PE. In that case, after 20 years you will return your invested money.

&#x200B;

In case of Tesla the PE = 1,600 

And PS = 30

In that case you will return your investment in Tesla after 1,600 years.

And even in PS value it is still much valued than PS of the house.",A_nilsen,1,/r/investing/comments/lq0p2b/tesla_dip_discussion_thread/gofmupu/,0.016,0.936,0.048,0.5509

- google's PE has ranged from about 20-35 since 2015 with the exception of first half of 2018 where it spiked up to peak PE of 58.

- Microsoft's PE has ranged from 8 to 45 (usually around 15-25) since 2007

- Samgung's median PE over hte past 13 years was 9.49

This is straight up false. Tesla GAINED market share in the worldwide EV market in 2020 despite many new competitors coming to market. Tesla will continue to gain market share as they ramp their Shanghai factory, Berlin factory, and Texas factory while the broader EV market grows at around 50%, Tesla will grow unit sales >50%. 

> Considering all the quality issues coming out with model Y, maybe single piece casting isn’t such a hot idea.

None of the quality issues I’ve heard stem from the single piece casting, and it’s totally normal for the first iteration of car toward the beginning of its production ramp to have quality issues. The Model 3 had production issues in 2017, but since then those have been sorted out and now the latest Model 3s have average reliability/quality. Anyway, clearly hundreds of thousands of people buying Tesla and giving it the highest owner satisfaction rating don’t prioritize perceived quality and instead are more interested in an overall compelling product that is unmatched in the EV market",32no,2,/r/investing/comments/lq0p2b/tesla_dip_discussion_thread/goeoqvo/,0.016,0.852,0.131,0.9666

No, it hasn't.  Perhaps among laymen, perhaps so rampantly that you may believe it's mainstream thought, but among economists and policy experts CPI and PCE are both thought to be quite accurate measures.

See, part of the problem is there's an attitude among laymen that their own anecdotes and spitballin of their experience is somehow more important than data.  It's like ""I can look at the temperature this year vs last year and tell you global warming isn't real"".  Obviously that sounds silly yes, but when applied to inflation it's smart?

I would advise you to read up on some of the psychological biases in price fixation and hindsight bias with relation to costs.  You might actually find the boogeyman you're looking for.

403,MS," As a side note to your post, one of the things that isn't realized about ""rare inherited genetic conditions"" is that many are thought to be rare, but with the advent of DNA sequencing for medical purposes, what was once considered rare may not be as rare as previously thought. For example, my grandson was diagnosed with ""Li-Fraumeni Syndrome"" a genetic mutation of tp53 (basically our two copies allow us to fight off cancers...elephants have ten copies so seldom get cancer). Not too long ago there were only 300 cases of LFS detected in the U.S. After meeting with geneticists at UCSF and Stanford, they are realizing that this cancer predisposition may actually be 1 in 20,000 once DNA testing becomes more commonplace. By this I mean not just ordered by a doctor because a child has a rare brain cancer, but everyone being tested so they know what mutations they are up against. LFS is only one of hundreds, maybe thousands of DNA mutations that destroy families...and as a mutant family, already having lost my 5 year old grandson, I believe my daughter's only hope (she is 31 and has already had one cancer due to the same mutation), will be gene therapy. This is going to rock our world in ways unimaginable, from curing ALS, Parkinsons, MS, to a multitude of other genetic horrors, like Li-Fraumeni Syndrome. Finally, mutations are being discovered in record numbers, that with gene replacement therapy will be a game changer for millions.

439,FAT," Because the person replying is unnecessarily being an asshole.

Yeah, you might miss out on FAT GAINZ if the stock hits $20+ by October, but let's be real, that's probably not going to happen. And even if it does, you'll have still made a decent profit selling at $15/$17.50, even if you haven't made MAXIMUM GAINZ.

Given the potential downside (that one of their trials fails, etc) I think selling calls for $15-17.50 is sensible. I've been considering the same. If I have to sell at $17.50 cos the stock is worth $20, so be it. I missed out on a bit of profit, but I scooped up the majority AND got the premium.

The only way I'd be annoyed at selling for $17.50 would be if the price shoots up to $35, which is highly unlikely. Plus, you still have the remaining shares that you haven't sold calls on, to realize the rest of the profit.

I think there are too many people in the investment circles who are angry at the influx of newbies trying to get involved. They act like they're better than everyone else cos they've been doing it for longer. Such bizarre behaviour.",Fox_Malloy,2,/r/investing/comments/lpzh9d/agtc_biopharma_play_with_100_upside_dd/goh6ca8/,0.096,0.79,0.114,0.6
440,ABC," Example: You own 100 shares of stock ""ABC"" that you purchased for $5 per share. Let's say you plan on holding this stock for at least 3-6 months or more. If you want to, you can choose to sell a call option. 

First you would need to select when you want your contract to expire. Then you would select the price at which you would be comfortable selling. Let's say you want to sell at $7.50. You can then find an call option with a $7.50 strike price (the price at which you will sell). Then, just like stocks, there will be a bid and an ask for the option. This is the premium you collect on the sale of the contract. Let's say for this example the premium was $1. Since each contract is worth 100 shares, the person who buys your call will pay you $100 when the contract expires or is exercised. They will buy your 100 shares from you at the agreed upon strike price of $7.50, or they will let the contract expire (since the stock never reached that price in the market and it would be cheaper for the buyer to buy the shares off the market than from your call). 

There is some downside to selling covered calls. You cannot sell your shares any higher than the strike price of the contract. So lets say your stock ABC goes up to $10, whoever buys your contract still has the right to buy your 100 shares for $7.50 so you ""lose"" profit. You also need to retain your 100 shares for the duration of the contract so there is less flexibility to move them as you please. 

However, consider that you are also hedging against the stock price going down. If you bought ABC stock at $5, sold a call with a $1 premium, you have hedged against a $1 drop in the price of the stock, since your 100 shares @ $4 is $400, and the $100 premium you collect brings you back to net even. This is a basic explanation and you should research covered calls more thoroughly before you decide if it is the right strategy for you.",lipscarf,2,/r/investing/comments/lpzh9d/agtc_biopharma_play_with_100_upside_dd/gof1lda/,0.029,0.862,0.108,0.9789

443,AGTC," yeah, if you don't understand options I would recommend staying away from them until you're comfortable. 

I'll give you an example based on my actual position, but lets just say I only owned 100 shares of AGTC that I paid $6/share for. My cost is $600. 

Personally, I would be happy selling anywhere above $15. So, I chose to sell a call option. It is called a covered call since I own the 100 shares, therefore I can ""cover"" the contract if the buyer chooses to exercise it. 

Looking at the options available there was one that expired on 10/15. I decided to select a strike price of $17.50. I was able to charge a $2 premium for this contract. Since each contract is worth 100 shares, that means the buyer paid me $200 for the right to purchase 100 shares from me at any time between now and 10/15 for $17.50/share. I will collect this premium once the contract is closed, either because it was never exercised and expired, or because the share price rose above $17.50 and the buyer decided to exercise the contract and purchase my shares. 

So lets say the stock price next month is trading at $20. The buyer could exercise the contract, pay me $1,750 ($17.5x100) for my shares, and I collect my premium of $200. With a $600 cost for my 100 shares, I would make 200%+ if this trade is executed. I'm happy with that, even though I technically lost out on $50 in extra profit. 

The reason I sell covered calls is to hedge against potential losses. In the example I provided, I am collecting a $200 premium selling the call. Let's say the stock price goes down to $4/share and the contract expires. I have lost $200 on the stock, but made $200 by selling the call, so it's a wash. If the stock price rises, but doesn't go above the strike price, then the contract will expire, I will collect the premium, and I will have made money on my shares.

Since each contract is worth 100 shares, that means the buyer paid me $200 for the right to purchase 100 shares from me at any time between now and 10/15 for $17.50/share. I will collect this premium once the contract is closed, either because it was never exercised and expired, or because the share price rose above $17.50 and the buyer decided to exercise the contract and purchase my shares. 

So lets say the stock price next month is trading at $20. The buyer could exercise the contract, pay me $1,750 ($17.5x100) for my shares, and I collect my premium of $200. With a $600 cost for my 100 shares, I would make 200%+ if this trade is executed. I'm happy with that, even though I technically lost out on $50 in extra profit. 

The reason I sell covered calls is to hedge against potential losses. In the example I provided, I am collecting a $200 premium selling the call. Let's say the stock price goes down to $4/share and the contract expires. I have lost $200 on the stock, but made $200 by selling the call, so it's a wash. If the stock price rises, but doesn't go above the strike price, then the contract will expire, I will collect the premium, and I will have made money on my shares.

1. You mention BSky's current satellites are 100cm but that they can rapidly deploy tech with lower cm. Does that imply they don't have any 50cm operational? If so, how do you think about when they might be able to have those in the sky? Also, you mentioned they are doing 50cm but not 30cm? What are the implications of that? 
2. I agree with your enthusiasm around AI/ML, but my bigger question is how big of a market is this? PLTR, ESTC, SNOW can be used for a wide variety of data sets vs. BSky which is geospatial data only. Said differently, BlackSky might make it easy to make sense of satellite data, but does that data then get plugged into SNOW/PLTR to provide an enterprise with more actionable recommendations?

456,GIS," You lost me at trying to compare these small lower resolution satellites with larger satellites with 10+ year life cycles and different missions/capabilities. Not to mention trying to compare traditional imagery with SAR. To jump to your conclusions:  


a) Their hardware isn't disruptive at all. You keep acting like their hardware is somehow unique to them, its not, its just a slightly different mission. If Maxar/Airbus wanted to make smaller cheaper more numerous shorter lived satellites you bet your ass they could.

b) Their imagery isn't disruptive at all. Its lower resolution than what those other two offer and about the same as the other competitors you mention. Also these smaller, lower altitude satellites don't cover as much ground per day as the larger satellites. They keep touting how cheap their satellites are, but it would take a constellation of 50-60 of them to cover as much ground as a few bigger satellites (and still at a lower spatial resolution). Since they have to be replaced every 2-3 years the costs are easily just as much as a few larger satellites.

c) The direct integration with their own software is the only thing that stands out, but even that isn't very compelling. Most established companies that already rely on aerial or satellite imagery have a GIS person (or team). They usually do a lot more than just look at some fancy pictures. Most companies aren't going to be dropping their GIS teams and all the hardware and software they have invested just to rely on a start up to feed them some inflexible product. And the example given is so... odd. A mining company wanting 1 meter resolution satellite imagery for security? Seriously? WTF are they gonna do with that?   


There are already dozens of software programs out there that streamline the collection of aerial imagery/satellite imagery with easy to use products. Even right to your phone or tablet.

459,AI," **Re #1:** 

BSKY Gen-2 sats get 100cm, Gen-3 sats get 50cm.  I would think that since BSKY's current gen sats are carrying 50cm sensors, it's likely they won't be upgrading in the coming year. Beyond that I wouldn't know. I'm not an engineer so wouldn't understand the specs, but I assume the reasoning behind going with 50cm res sensors has to do with the payload capacity of their smallsats. Without actually crunching the numbers, it looks like sensor resolution is inversely related to satellite size, but maybe there are exceptions. If true, then there's some model-able relationship between sensor resolution and constellation size, and it appears that there are several companies testing out different combinations.  BSKY with 16 50cm res smallsats, Planet with 130+ 3-5m res nanosats, MAXR with 6 30cm *whateversize*\-sats, etc.

 As for implications of resolution, its pretty tricky. In general, I think the value of imagery is exponentially related to fineness of resolution, i.e. as resolution gets finer, imagery becomes exponentially more valuable.  There's likely a well-defined threshold resolution that would be necessary to resolve enough detail to identify and track smaller targets, such as humans.  Maybe around 5 cm or less? That's just a guess tho. US gov probably already has something like that working, MIB-style.

**Re #2:**

I wasn't really comparing the underlying data itself to that of SNOW and PLTR, just comparing the benefits that BSKY Spectra would provide companies. Basically, your company cant just casually decide one day to try using fine-res sat imagery to track banana shipments in Mexico. You'd need to get employees with geospatial, big data, ML/AI expertise to build out that functionality.  By using Spectra, you can trim that number back as far as to zero employees, depending on your application.  Similarly, SNOW lets a company jump into cloud storage and access without bringing on a team of people, and PLTR lets a company jump into advanced AI/ML without needing an in-house team.

I dont think BSKY+SNOW would be a thing, but I'm confident that BSKY+PLTR would be. If PLTR is sending their technicians into a company to build out ML/AI pipelines and that company has preexisting access to BSKY data, then it would be reasonable to assume they would incorporate any and all available data.

About whether BSKY is a data provider or a standalone platform - that was my point with the Business Model #3 section, they do both. They construct, deploy, and operate their own satellites and sell the imagery. However, they also have their own SaaS called Spectra which is used to access and analyze the data. When they purchased OpenWhere, they gave the OpenWhere founder **the position of BSKY CEO**, which really highlights their focus on providing a robust SaaS platform. All other imagery companies are more focused on acquiring the imagery in the first place. I've played around with Planet's data interface and it's fairly rudimentary (pretty much just data scanning, basic manipulation) compared to what BSKY is claiming to have in Spectra. Also, through Spectra users can purchase other proprietary imagery, such as that from MAXR or Airbus, so if they achieve their goals, they could become the preeminent sat imagery SaaS company in addition to their data services.

I dont think BSKY+SNOW would be a thing, but I'm confident that BSKY+PLTR would be. If PLTR is sending their technicians into a company to build out ML/AI pipelines and that company has preexisting access to BSKY data, then it would be reasonable to assume they would incorporate any and all available data.

About whether BSKY is a data provider or a standalone platform - that was my point with the Business Model #3 section, they do both. They construct, deploy, and operate their own satellites and sell the imagery. However, they also have their own SaaS called Spectra which is used to access and analyze the data. When they purchased OpenWhere, they gave the OpenWhere founder **the position of BSKY CEO**, which really highlights their focus on providing a robust SaaS platform. All other imagery companies are more focused on acquiring the imagery in the first place. I've played around with Planet's data interface and it's fairly rudimentary (pretty much just data scanning, basic manipulation) compared to what BSKY is claiming to have in Spectra. Also, through Spectra users can purchase other proprietary imagery, such as that from MAXR or Airbus, so if they achieve their goals, they could become the preeminent sat imagery SaaS company in addition to their data services.

**Re #3:**

Satellite costs probably just boil down to size, and therefore complexity + weight. Smaller sats are simpler and therefore cheaper to build, and smaller sats weigh less so launch costs are lower. Hence why Planet and Satellogic nanosats are super cheap, BSKY/LeoStella smallsats somewhat more expensive, and MAXR/Airbus sats super expensive. But again, I'm not an engineer and haven't looked at those numbers too closely.",Egg_Veal,2,/r/investing/comments/lq1my2/dd_on_blacksky_a_long_look_into_the_future_of/gof0swe/,0.01,0.898,0.092,0.995
463,AI," Thanks again for the thoughtful insight.  

re: your response to my second question, I follow what you're saying. What I was trying to get at (and what I'm just trying to figure out for myself) is ultimately how big of a market is this and what can BSky (or anyone else) charge for these kinds of services and what does that equate to in terms of TAM. I imagine there will be an increase in use cases beyond ag, mining, security etc, so trying to understand if the tailwind is around use of satellite generated data or if Spectra fits into the broader enterprise software stack as a AI/ML platform. I think you answered my question though. BSky uses tech to make the data accessible and usable to a non-technical person, but its a platform like PLTR that would ingest that data and surface more actionable insights. That's not to minimize anything BSky is doing - just trying to understand where they fit in.

564,RSI," One can look at relative strength; above 70 is overbought, below 30 is oversold. If you go to stockcharts.com and type in ICLN for example, you can see the RSI chart as the top portion. If something starts to get above 70, it's starting to get technically  overbought. That does not mean that it can't get more overbought, but if you have something that gets into the 80s and particularly into the 90's, short-term it's very much overloved, overcrowded, overbought, etc. Something might work off an overbought condition by a period of going sideways/consolidation, or it might do what ICLN has done lately. 

Clean energy recently has seemed like an ""everyone on one side of the boat"" theme - if you look on here over the last month or two with people posting their portfolio it seemed like every other post had ICLN in it. That doesn't mean that ""clean energy investments bad"", but short term it became very overcrowded. Now I'm starting to see people talk about selling ICLN and other clean energy just as they're getting to the point of being technically oversold. If you look at the stockcharts chart for ICLN, you can also see periods where it became overbought in September and October that resulted in declines after. Those were somewhat milder declines, but ICLN didn't get *quite* as overbought during those periods or stay overbought for quite as long. Trying to go on overbought/oversold is not a perfect methodology by any means, but I think it's good at giving you a general idea of where something is in the short-term.",dvdmovie1,7,/r/investing/comments/lqeuus/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/gog4lmo/,0.034,0.869,0.096,0.939

576,BC," BC the whole idea of digital / decentralized finance is to actually, you know, be a useful form of payment. For buying and selling and so on. You literally cannot do that in any practical manner with BTC as it is. It's too slow to process transactions in real time. Settlement can take 10+ minutes at a minimum which absolutely won't fly for most merchants. And it lacks smart contract functionality. It's the biggest bubble and by the time most of the investors, who are blissfully unaware or ignorant of its huge limitations, learn this they will be left holding the bag. Look up the Tether pump too. BTC is only ""valued"" as highly as it is because Tether has been forging transactions to inflate its price. Well guess what the NY AG ruling came in and Tether is now subject to quarterly audits, even if they couldn't find definitive evidence they were committing fraud everyone knows there's no way they had as many USD coming in as they claimed. So my prediction is that the Tether pumping is effectively over and that is going to remove what was the floor propping BTC to USD up. Also worth noting that China is a serious threat for gaining 50%> of BTC's chain in the longer term. If that happened then the entire blockchain would be moot and there goes any store of value it might currently retain.

Ethereum at least has fast processing (soon to be faster as it's actively undergoing improvements), and, major point, smart contract functionality. It means tokens can have contracts etc that can be programmed to expand their functionality in numerous ways and directions. I'm not going to go on, Ethereum isn't even necessarily the most promising blockchain out there in my lay opinion there is still room for improvement all around the sector but it certainly has more to offer than Bitcoin.

608,TSLA," STOP LOSS OR NOT STOP LOSS?

So I’m watching a lot of videos about trading and some people say “Put always a stop loss to know where to exit” and others say “When you hold for long term you won’t put a stop loss”.

I’m confused.
Why if you hold for long term it’s better to not put a SL?

If you put a SL, you exit, don’t lose more money and then buy the dip putting another SL.. no?

Like what is happening in these days with TSLA.
You have an opened position at 800?
Check the ATR, multiply for 3-6 times and that’s your SL.
Then the market “crash”, you exit automatically at around 750 and buy at 640.

652,DD," Peculiar things I’ve found: there aren’t any accessible articles, studies, support showing positive takes on retail trading having any potential or success. Just random stats throw around saying 80-100% of retail traders fail. 
According to who? What is considered failing or succeeding?

We’ve all taken these stats and advice as true.. until now. We’re starting to scrutinize this. Us, our friends, our families have been making great trades for the last year.
Yes we’re in a bull market, but isn’t a bull market half of the reality? So why is the whole message that we just can’t do it and should leave this to the ‘professionals’?

So I dug further. I’m talking deep dark web further. Borderline conspiracy further.

All of the information I did find, information that was wiped out, and information bizarrely not accessible, makes me think we’ve been blatantly lied to all of this time.

Of course cnbc and the big boys want us to think trading for the every day person isn’t successful. If we knew the truth, they would be playing our game now, not the other way around.

We’ve seen with recent stock movements that social trading is a very real thing. Our ability to do our own technical DD is very real. We’ve shown we can do this, and we can make huge waves going against the big hedge fund grain.

I’m still investigating, but one thing is becoming clearer.

Shopify is coming along nicely too with a P/S of 54.90.

I think it's less a case of a P/S above 30 being risky, and more a case of fairly young companies that rapidly grow being inherently risky.

Of course if a well established & longstanding company had a really high P/S I'd run a mile. I just don't think a high P/S or a high P/E is always a clear-cut metric.

I personally would rather find growth stories that the rest of the market is not already pricing in - Peter Lynch referred to this as GARP - ""Growth At a Reasonable Price"". With companies like SQ and Shopify (and high-flying tech / cloud), yes they have huge growth potential but their valuation is telling you that the market is recognizing that already, so unless you know something the rest of the market does not I would say that the risk / reward ratio is off.

My understanding of the issue is that certain sectors in particular are significantly more overvalued than others which will feel the brunt of any possible correction as this post and the recent couple days imply. In particular, I think EV and virtually all of the ARK holdings might be in for a ride.

689,AAPL," This is surely true, but I think the point of this post was warning investors to potentially wait. It's true that AAPL did and likely will recover from any downturns, but I think there is value in seeing warning signs and hedging yourself against some bearish manuevers - whether that be buying OTM puts, diversifying into value, or otherwise. It really is hard though when everything goes to shit",backfire97,1,/r/investing/comments/lqqoks/watch_your_ps_ratio_ps_over_30_is_incredibly_risky/goiemqq/,0.156,0.68,0.164,-0.0945
690,IAG," Okay, let's start at the top. By MAD I'm assuming you mean the Madrid exchange? So on the MAD IAG is listed as a value in Euros and cents. In London all stocks are listed at a value in pence, not pounds. Therefore when it says the stock price is 190 that's actually 190 pence, so £1.90. After exchange to Euros you'll find this matches the MAD value. 

IAG had a right issue in September, this meant for ever two shares you owned you had the right to purchase another three at a discounted rate. I think that was the ratio, I'm sure I'll be corrected if wrong! So yes the shares were diluted overall hence the price dropping bit since the stock split anyone who owned shares prior and bough all of their allocated rights is currently is up from the pre split price.

I'll be honest I'm not 100% sure if the rights issue is taken into account with the charts. Unlike a stock split it's not a simple case of just dividing by 4 to make the prices match. My assumption would be that anyone who didn't take up their right to buy then sold the option to buy to someone else. So I would assume that every rights issue given was taken up by someone, even if it was IAG itself. My guess would be that the charts took this into account with 2 shares now becoming 5. Again, someone might be able to correct me on this.

Hope some of that helps! 

I'm long IAG, bought in May and bought my full allocation during the rights issue as well.",samtheman268,2,/r/investing/comments/lqef68/iag_shares_price_and_market_cap/gog13w5/,0.05,0.814,0.136,0.9556

Ah this is it! Now I feel like an idiot ahah thanks!

>My guess would be that the charts took this into account with 2 shares now becoming 5.

Well tbh it doesn't look like this to me. Charts about share price make it seems like IAG is still down, although that market cap chart I found clearly shows it's not down anymore. This is the most confusing part to me. Or better, the mere fact that this information is hard to find confuses me. And I'm not even sure about it's reliability",idkwhatiamdoingg,1,/r/investing/comments/lqef68/iag_shares_price_and_market_cap/gog27gj/,0.08,0.736,0.184,0.9236

694,IR," They have an inverse relation, when IR increases, Stocks valuations tend to drop.  
Cost of borrowing - if interest rates are low, you can borrow money for very cheap and dump it into the stock market for higher return. Basically, whats happening now, interest is so low that the only option that makes sense is to invest it into equities.

But when IR increases, some long-term bonds become more attractive. Additionally, debt because more expensive to firms as they have to make higher interest payments.  
Interest rate is referred to as risk-free rate in financial models. You can read up on the relationship there as well  to see where it participates and how it affects stock prices, company valuation, opportunity costs etc",Dank_Investor,5,/r/investing/comments/lqpzev/lets_talk_about_interest_rates_and_stocks/gohucsk/,0.085,0.773,0.142,0.8468

Or maybe external reasons like in this case inflation expectations (for bonds) or interest rates (for stocks in their DCF valuation). There's also still just as much cash, each buyer gave their cash to a seller on the other side.

&#x200B;

Also as most of us have probably noticed, anytime a major event is bound to happen or an anticipated earnings, we typically see a run up which then leads to a sell off. Typical case of buy the rumor and sell the news.
