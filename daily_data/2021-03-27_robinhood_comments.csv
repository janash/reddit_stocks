0,RH," I mean, this is a feature in almost every application you use.   Definitely not exclusive to RH.  RH is shite for many other “real” problems.",Advertising_Limp,1,/r/RobinHood/comments/mefxxf/_/gsha0wt/,0.152,0.747,0.101,-0.0951
1,FB," How doesn’t it make sense? RH tracks that you buy X and Y stocks. Sells that data to an advertising company. Then that company knows to target you with ads for buying stocks on FB or even Reddit. 

I’m not advocating that it’s good. Just explaining how it works.",JustaBountyHunter,1,/r/RobinHood/comments/mefxxf/_/gsgy5kc/,0.0,0.941,0.059,0.4404

3,RH," It doesn’t “need” to be turned off. 

They say they don’t share the info with market makers.

It’s the same as when you watch videos on YouTube then get related ads or seeing ads based on your amazon searches. 

It’s just for ads, if you want the ads you see not be based on what you do on RH, then turn it off. If you don’t care about this, then it doesn’t matter.",Apertures_,1,/r/RobinHood/comments/mefxxf/_/gsh7kcn/,0.0,0.877,0.123,0.7579
4,RH," Yeah commenter seems to think this legal jumbo was written to *convince* us this is ok. No, this is just an settings option and statement that covers them legally. People need to understand that RH doesn’t give a fuck about you as an individual lmao. That doesn’t mean they try to trick you, no, it means they literally don’t give enough fucks to even consider such a thing. This is standard shit that’s in hundreds of apps it’s not some super secret plan to deceive you lmao. If you are worried about RH and your data just delete the fucking app and use a different broker. 

If anyone still uses RH and puts any effort into showing the world how they are getting fucked over, they don’t actually care about RH or they would just switch brokers. I feel like this shit is always attention grabbing bs or people who have zero idea what they are ever talking about. Fuck RH btw too.",PokeYa,1,/r/RobinHood/comments/mefxxf/_/gsh09nz/,0.181,0.712,0.107,-0.9374

6,RH, you sell the options right before they expire. RH is supposed to do that for you but they didn’t for me today and wouldn’t fill my sell order for the spread. i was alright tho because i covered my short leg buying it back then separately sold the long leg,intellectualballer,1,/r/RobinHood/comments/me0ecf/how_likely_am_i_to_be_assigned_in_a_put_credit/gsdkwgu/,0.0,0.949,0.051,0.3612
