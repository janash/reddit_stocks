2,RSI," Trying to replicate this screen in Street Smart Edge. There seems to a problem manually checking shares outstanding in their logic fields. Have to stick to between 10M and 100M.

 I can't seem to figure out the following:

1. Which RSI is this for? I have options for RSI 10 / 30 / 50 (From close, or general)
2. Can't figure out where to put the custom scripts in, is there a specific type of area this might be in? They probably don't support custom scripts... I ended up just replicating this logic with comparing % of Volume to Avg 5 Day Vol of 300% like you describe

7,ZKIN," Believe it or not, ZKIN is the future. The second most important time didn't  give a sell signal at all as the EMA's are still pointing towards a 4 hour uptrend. If we would look on daily time frame, we would see that the price is trying to bounce off 20 EMA, continuing in daily strong uptrend. On the 4 hour time frame we can see that the bearish momentum has faltered at $6.00 and the price of ZKIN started to regain value. Ideally to continue in a strong uptrend, the price would need to hold above 20 4h EMA which is currently located at $7.60, just where the price is located now. A good sign.

Yeah I’m sure there’s some day traders who want to sell the news and make a small profit but I think this stock could literally pop any day now so everything points to upwards movement.

As long as it is a valid company with valid good news it should get back up to roughly that point. But hype for a rumor of good news can also inflate it to higher than the good news would have gotten you in the first place by itself. Especially with small companies you are not buying into the profitability of the company like you are thinking...you are buying into current public perception of the profitability of the company. And current public perception can change drastically. Hence in the march sell off...Apple didnt suddenly lose 30% of its assets and the sales didn't decline and their sales from 2019 didn't suddenly vanish...Public perception of market stability declined and so AAPL fell right along with it as people cashed out in fear of the world ending.",Upper-Director-38,41,/r/pennystocks/comments/lve86y/friendly_reminder_hiti_hightide_earnings_call_is/gpbwkni/,0.015,0.851,0.134,0.9677

32,DD," Agreed! I too am excited about NMG, and am considering getting more shares, as I got in when they were at 2.05 😅

But since this is such a good DD, I thought it would be pertinent to add actual concerns and risks so people aren't surprised later.

Take nickel, for example. Musk said ""Tesla will give you a giant contract for a long period of time if you mine nickel efficiently and in an environmentally sensitive way"".

And now Musk is seeing how much of a bottleneck nickel will be for production, so he's moving towards lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries for the Model 3 in China.

I got into nickel, and know that it will be relevant for a while in EV batteries, but I know that it may not be relevant forever. So that helps me plan my exit strategy from my nickel positions. I want my fellow graphite holders to have the same knowledge (about silicone), and plan their exit strategy accordingly 😉

Finally, Tesla isn't the only game in town. Other manufacturers are going to use a host of minerals. Also, there will be several battery technologies out there. I see different batteries for expense, high-end cars; cheap, get around town cars; last-mile delivery vehicles; semi trucks. Can graphite and silicone both do well? Absolutely! This isn't an either-or situation.

Invest wisely and confidently, my friends. 😄

A lot of us have Doctors/Nurses in our families and they have opinions on everything just like anyone else. Other medical professionals may have a different opinion from that one and they may like the Mino-lok device. 

It'd be nice to have as many medical professionals come in as well because we can then see some kind of consensus, good or bad for CTXRs pipeline. 

And honestly..even if its bad towards Mino-lok, it probably doesn't mount to much on the CTXR tickers stock forecast here. 

I've worked in Hospitals on the ITS side for 23 years now and I can tell you how much financial waste I've seen with these big hospital chains. One chain I was involved with spent a billion dollars on a device for all their hospitals only to realize it wasn't very useful in the end. And they moved onto the next device a year later.

The price of ZKIN shares is currently above 2,5 year high by breaking below $5.00 per share area. And their xsigma is under high demand - Dwight Howard from the Philadelphia 76ers to join. Fascinating news, perfectly fits into xsigma strategy and #ZKIN shows high growth, curios to discuss.

Appears the Lake wants to do it independently for themselves to showcase their product. They seem to be very confident in what the results will show. 

As far as the potential for the price to dip. There have been three pull backs in the last month and every time the price support increases. From a bottom of .20, to .25, and now around .28. These weren’t even pull backs, they look like sell offs people take advantage of because they know the stock is solid. Wish I would’ve sold at some peaks and bought back the dips

Look at the market caps of competitors.

325,IBKR," I'm just venting here, so my apologies for the long post. I just wanted the catharises of a good moan.

Totally newbie here. UK based and looking to trade a few US penny stocks for 'fun'.  I've paper traded for a while and enjoyed it, so figured I'd give it a go with a couple of hundred dollars. My experience in getting started has been a chore to say the least.

After asking around and doing some research I decided to try IBKR as a broker. Went though all the shenanigans of setting up an account over the weekend, the process was quite in-depth compared to the 'apps' I had tried out before, asking me about my liquid wealth, my income, even my employer details.  It was a pain but I found it reassuring.  I spent most of the weekend trying to navigate the portal and figure out how to do basic stuff as this is pretty much my first time looking at any of this.  It has a preview feature that allows you to check the details of a trade before you submit it. However when it came to penny stocks I didn't have trade permissions.

I specially went with IKBR because it supports US pennies from within the UK. I eventually figured out that I needed to enable it in my trade permissions, which was fine. But the next part really surprised me.  I was informed that to trade US penny stocks I needed to have completed more that 100 trades, have an income in excess of $50k and a liquid wealth in excess of $75k. Where on earth is the logic in this? It's perfectly fine for me to operate in a market where shares can go for hundreds of dollars, but I'm not allowed in the kiddie pool until I can swim Olympic lengths?

I'm sure this is a regulatory thing and the broker pretty much just tells you to change your answers to get past it. Maybe there is even a good reason for it my newbie brain doesn't know about yet. But still it fells like a great big 'fuck you poor person, stay in your lane' to me and it's annoyed me no end.

Anyway, rant over.",MorrowDisca,2,/r/pennystocks/comments/luzwb7/the_lounge_thoughts_noob_stuff_low_effort_brokers/gpak6qf/,0.054,0.803,0.144,0.9892

They have record breaking growth rate- even in a pandemic. And the numbers in q4 2020 are double as high as ‘18 - what are you talking about?! 
Numbers are wrong and You should mention that all management accepts a lot of their salary in shares. 
Yes, the company used the spike in January for finance purposes who would not at 350% higher prices than the lows= less dilution.
