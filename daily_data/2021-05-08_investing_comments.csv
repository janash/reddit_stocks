4,CP," With the current push for the cancer that is ""Precision Scheduled Railroading"" or PSR that was led by Hunter Harrison (formerly of CN and CP, now hell where he belongs) there's volatility  that you won't see with the usual metrics.

PSR's push for lower crew starts by combining multiple trains, minimal crew rest, crew reduction down to one man, and foregoing maintenance on both rail and rolling stock leads to increased incidents.  An example being one like [this](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/wyoming/articles/2021-01-25/report-brake-failure-probable-cause-of-wyoming-train-wreck), where it not only cost $3.2 million in damage but also the lives of two crew members.

That was the damage that was caused by the push for PSR in a rural area with no hazmat.  When hazmat is involved it can lead to tragedies such as [Graniteville.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graniteville_train_crash)  And Graniteville was small time (chorline gas) compared to the some of the other things that we haul such as [Anhydrous Ammonia.](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/ershdb/emergencyresponsecard_29750013.html)",cleardiddion,4,/r/investing/comments/n7ei1n/guess_who_has_no_future_competetion_and_is_not_in/gxe1wwk/,0.125,0.855,0.02,-0.9505

23,HUGE," Self-driving long haul trucking is going to be a LONG ways off I feel. The tech is simply not there yet and there is a HUGE amount of legal grey area to sort out. Honestly, I'm willing to bet that ""smart"" self-driving is never actually going to take off, at least in terms of a car fully navigating from point A to point B relying on nothing but visual/lidar cues. There's simply too many unique situations that come up that require some sort of ""creative"" or experience-based decision-making. And even if by some miracle it gets to that level, you'd run into significant legal issues, ESPECIALLY if you're talking about long-haul trucking through many states and jurisdictions.  


More likely, I see a push towards smart infrastructure that a slightly dumber ""smart"" car or truck can navigate more easily. It'll be more of advanced cruise control on major highways to start, maybe dedicated shipping hubs where smart trucks come in and dumb trucks go out locally. Dedicated zones or lanes where the self-driving features can take over, perhaps. But unrestricted, completely autonomous navigation on current infrastructure? I just don't see it ever happening.",silenttd,12,/r/investing/comments/n7ei1n/guess_who_has_no_future_competetion_and_is_not_in/gxd2av4/,0.034,0.79,0.175,0.9795

This Sum-of-parts valuation was done by Chris Bloomstran, one of the most respected Berkshire experts, and founder of Semper Augustus hedge fund. It was done after the Q4 report. There has been another amazing quarter from Berkshire since then and about $6 billion in share repurchases. 

If you look it values BNSF at $100-$110 billion. Its comparable in size and revenue to UNP, which is trading at around $150. The conservative estimates are applied to everything including the energy, retail, and insurance businesses. **It even applies a -$39 billion discount to their $300+ billion equity portfolio to account for the fact that market valuations are high.** Basically it is saying even if you value its companies super conservatively, Berkshire is worth around $746 billion, or $325 a share. It's currently trading at $290 a share.

If you use market comp values in this estimate, it would place Berkshire above $400 a share. In other words, you get exposure to great businesses at a massive discount.",Kanolie,39,/r/investing/comments/n7ei1n/guess_who_has_no_future_competetion_and_is_not_in/gxcwiri/,0.007,0.82,0.174,0.9854

Also they're sitting on a lot of cash, and the market is hot. When investment funds trade at a premium it's typically saying 'there is value in the excellent management/stock-picking being done here'; trading *at* NAV, where assets include a pile of cash, would say 'the stock-picking is so good, this cash is basically as hot as the shares they own, I know they'll do something great with it'.",OJFord,11,/r/investing/comments/n7ei1n/guess_who_has_no_future_competetion_and_is_not_in/gxdbzn2/,0.017,0.814,0.169,0.9568

34,AI," Exactly. There's a lot of situations where you change your driving because you can see somebody else isn't paying attention, especially in a busy parking lot. There's also situations where the appropriate thing to do, isn't necessarily the legal thing to do.

From a legislation standpoint, they're NEVER going to get to a place where we put the entire responsibility of a fatal crash on a computer. Operating a motor vehicle is always going to have to have a human being who is ultimately responsible for the safe operation of the car, which means that they're always going to have to have someone with some sort of power to ""override"" in the driver's seat.

39,COIN," I've invested in ARK for a bit over a year, and I honestly think success has gotten to their heads. They pulled off something quite miraculous in 2020 march, since their max drawdown (ARKK) was about 31%, comparable to SPY. To be down only as much as SPY in the depths of a crash while being all in on speculative securities involves some degree of finesse. Since February of 2021, ARKK is facing similar drawdowns to March, but they are getting absolutely blasted compared to other stock market indicators (SPY, QQQ, QQQJ, MOON, other ARK funds even), and I think they aren't learning from their mistakes.

They started buying many companies that were inside my circle of competence and I strongly disagree with their calls. They bought many SPACs at >40% premium over NAV and held through their drop straight back to NAV. They held $10 SPACs through merger just to see them tank below NAV - an unforgiveable sin in the SPAC world. Their 2025 valuation of Tesla is just asinine. The valuation itself can be justifiable, but their rationale that Tesla can create a $300B robotaxi business that one, doesn't exist today, and two, is several times larger than the global taxi industry today is bollocks. It doesn't inspire much confidence in their fundamental analysis. Its entirely possible to do growth and speculative only investing and still apply fundamental analysis in valuations.

I don't understand why Cathy piled onto PLTR in the $20s range after it mooned from $10 in the DPO and $7 in the pre-DPO. ARK couldn't figure out that PLTR was good at $10, but only joined after it skyrocketed? I don't need a fund manager to FOMO into stocks for me. Also, if they decided that PLTR was a good value at $20, surely they could have sold sometime by the time it hit $40? Typically, I wouldn't fault a fund manager for not aggressively rotating positions, but due to how frequently ARK trades on a daily basis, there has to be some technical and fundamental reasons for rotating in and out of positions, and the lack of foresight to get out of overvalued companies is objectionable.  

Finally, the fact that Cathy fully piled into COIN despite their obscene valuation and lack of moat (95% of revenue from trading fees?) was a terrible idea. It seems like Cathy is bent on buying disruptive businesses despite their valuation. I could do that myself if I just wanted to invest on disruptors and by social sentiment. The precipitous drop on COIN was totally predictable. 

Disclaimer: I still hold a substantial portion of my portfolio in ARK, though I have sold off the more I reviewed their daily trades, which don't inspire too much confidence for me.

Typically, I wouldn't fault a fund manager for not aggressively rotating positions, but due to how frequently ARK trades on a daily basis, there has to be some technical and fundamental reasons for rotating in and out of positions, and the lack of foresight to get out of overvalued companies is objectionable.  

Finally, the fact that Cathy fully piled into COIN despite their obscene valuation and lack of moat (95% of revenue from trading fees?) was a terrible idea. It seems like Cathy is bent on buying disruptive businesses despite their valuation. I could do that myself if I just wanted to invest on disruptors and by social sentiment. The precipitous drop on COIN was totally predictable. 

Disclaimer: I still hold a substantial portion of my portfolio in ARK, though I have sold off the more I reviewed their daily trades, which don't inspire too much confidence for me. ARKF is still quite quality IMO since they have fewer garbage companies; rather they have solid companies which may be expensive, but are durable growth.",shimszy,48,/r/investing/comments/n7cmlw/help_me_understand_cathie_woods_math_on_her/gxclq58/,0.088,0.808,0.104,0.5232

67,FOR," Yes and her published models are an embarrassment.

 Copied from a previous comment I made:

https://ark-invest.com/articles/analyst-research/tesla-price-target-2/

First off their ""bull case"" assumes its possible for them to achieve $327 billion in JUST robo-taxi revenue (a non-existent technology) by 2025! That is more revenue than Apple makes selling all their products and services. Where do they think that money would come from? That is like 30x what Uber currently brings in. If it was even possible to make like 1/2 of that, why would Tesla even be selling cars in the first place? Why not just run the fleet of taxis?
Here is a video of saying that Tesla would have FOR SURE 1 million robo-taxis on the road by last year:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiWbdZ8ItRs&ab_channel=TechInsider

**Tesla reported no autonomous testing on California’s public roads during 2020 to the CA DMV:**
https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/vehicle-industry-services/autonomous-vehicles/disengagement-reports/

What a joke...

Ok now for their ""bear case""...
This involves the projection of Tesla achieving $42 billion in human driven ride hailing revenue (4x what uber makes now). Ya, not happening. Also, creating a $23 billion insurance business out of thin air. Progressive Insurance for reference, has a revenue of $40 billion or so revenue, which took them many decades to build. Here is an expert in insurance valuation and founder of Semper Augustus hedge fund Chris Bloomstran, explaining how idiotic this projection is: https://tweet.lambda.dance/ChrisBloomstran/status/1373410803559321614

Here are Tesla's current revenue numbers on those areas:

**Robo-Taxi Ride Hailing: $0**

**Human Driven Ride-Hailing: $0**

**Auto Insurance: $0**

Keep in mind, Cathie has repeatedly stated that Tesla is their ""highest conviction stock"". If this is the kind of work they do for that, why would you expect them to do any better on everything else?

70,GME," I think you’re missing my point. Buying stocks is fun. Being told not to and invest in the same ETF every sensible person has isn’t. It’s not what they come here for. 

I come from WSB but I’m not a YOLO freak. I came out with a 40+ percent return last year by speculating. I also understand my wsBETS money this year could zero out despite being something stupid up on GME. That’s why it has bets in the name. 

I’m here for investing. WSB for betting. If I wanted a bit of advice to just stick money in VIX I would have done that and buggered off. 

Do you see my point? Why repeatedly telling people coming to an investing forum interested in investing to go pay of debt and buy the safest ETF isn’t the greatest idea?

71,GME," GME has made improvements by paying down debt, but it's trading at a PS ratio of 2 when it historically has sat around 0.2. This can only be justified once it has proven it can adapt to the post-retail environment. High PS ratios only make sense for growing companies, not ones that continually shrink.

GME is a tiny company that was propped up by a frenzy of speculative retail interest, as the buzz fades these people will move onto other things (maybe Doge lol). They're not the stable investor base you want. The smart money that identified GME years ago like Michael Burry (big short guy) sold their shares long ago. 

Plus when an actual recession hits, the stocks with the most hot air will get suplexed so hard.

In some cases, self certification is fine (usually the smaller investments, maybe some 506(b) exemptions even, because they can have up to 35 non-accredited investors). But they are usually not the best investments out there.

&#x200B;

The more serious ones (and that includes 506(c)), you will need to provide documentation. Sponsor has to take reasonable steps for you to be accredited. You can either provide your w2 or broker statement, or go through 3rd party (VerifyInvestor, AccredditedAM, CPA, etc.). It does not matter if the investment is $250k, you could have borrowed the money after all. Those sponsors can raise the money anyway from some other investors, so they won’t take the risk. not worth it for them.

130,ABC," >How do people have to buy back shares of the company they are short on?

They just go buy the shares like you or me (more or less) place an order on the market to buy shares. There is nothing really different from buying shares to open a long position or buying shares to cover a short position , you just go buy shares

However one of the rules of shorting is you always need enough money (or collateral) to cover your short plus a buffer usually 20% .

So simple example lets say ABC is at $100 a share

I short 1 share , after my short position in my brokerage I have

$120 cash

$200 in other stocks

\-1 share of ABC

Lets say a week later ABC rises to $150, at this point I am still ok, I could use my $120 in cash and then sell $30 worth of my stock holding if I needed to cover

Now a week later it rises to $300. Now I am in trouble , my brokerage is worried if it rises more I will not be able to cover. What if it rise to $350? I only have 120 cash and 200 Other investments so now I am at risk of not being able to close it. At this point I am in a margin call and my brokerage will force me to

1. deposit more money
2. Sell off my holdings ($200 in stock) then buy back 1 share of ABC

Now in a squeeze this may make the stock keep going higher , as the stock rises more people get margin called and are forced to buy the stock what in turn pushes the stock even higher",SirGlass,5,/r/investing/comments/n7l5q3/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/gxe6ewa/,0.035,0.864,0.101,0.932
131,GME, One thing to remember about short squeezes is that they are generally temporary spikes in the stock price. If you look at the stock prices of classic short squeezes that have occurred like Volkswagon or GME - the price always settles back down. There is also no guarantee that a stock will squeeze simply because there is short interest in the stock. People are shorting a stock for a reason.,greytoc,3,/r/investing/comments/n7l5q3/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/gxemrgp/,0.031,0.865,0.105,0.6486
132,IBM," > a short is when you bet a company will fail, more or less.

Not necessarily fail, but a bet that the company is worth less than the market is pricing them right now.

For example Jim chanos is short IBM, he doesn’t necessarily think IBM would fail anytime soon, he just thinks their future earnings projections are wildly optimistic.",FinndBors,1,/r/investing/comments/n7l5q3/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/gxejbfg/,0.141,0.778,0.081,-0.6059
133,AMC," Thanks. Taking the case of AMC, if I may ask about it, I see people do a lot of DD, how AMC isn't issuing any new shares, so what's on the market is all there is. In this case, if all the shares were bought up by retail investors (the little guys), the funds would be in trouble as they can't buy back any more shares?

135,FSR," For those that have never read the FSR reports, please make sure you understand how its structured and the language that is used. One suggestion is to look at the previous few years so you can get a feel for the report's intent.

137,IMO," If I had to guess, they just price SpaceX based on the share value at the last funding round.  Their most recent annual report gives a value of $270 per share of SpaceX they own.  SpaceX series N funding round -the most recent- raised at $270 a share.

IMO you shouldn't buy this fund for .22% SpaceX exposure.  Baron Partners Fund has 5% SpaceX, if you *really* want some SpaceX.  It's expensive, but you're paying 4x the total SpaceX exposure in fees annually through the Fidelity fund.  Not worth it if all you want is SpaceX.

Don't pick FBGRX for diversity.  If you buy $4750 of VTI and $250 BPTRX, you get the same amount of SpaceX you would get from $5000 FBGRX, much greater diversity, and a much lower average expense ratio.  Don't compromise on a more diverse fund because BPTRX is too concentrated.  Just buy less BPTRX, and more of a fund you want for reasons other than SpaceX.",thri54,2,/r/investing/comments/n7vffk/how_are_preipo_stocks_valued_in_mutual_funds/gxf7yav/,0.029,0.876,0.095,0.6909

Maybe not what you're looking for. Not a strategy. Point is you can deviate from normal returns if you dont diversify much (in both directions).

146,TA," I have a solid 7 figure portfolio... so betting plenty. But if you can read the market, do some TA, Charting, Using Fibonacci, historical trends... reading the market becomes easy. I can sit down and play with a $10K stash and make 30% on it in less than an hour trading the 5 minute charts... If the volatility is there, I can make it work.

I essentially have a 2 prong approach. Long term stash that is about 85% of my holdings. I don't short term trade that... usually I enter and exit when I see large market trends move... trades are months long most of the time.

I also have a smaller stash of 15% that I use for shorter term investing when the projects I am looking enter a good setup after a long consolidation period... These trades range from few days to few weeks.

I also use about $30K or so to spot trade with leverage, ranging between 10x-150x depending on what timeframe I am using.

147,AFL," You have to be careful with your line of thinking.  For one thing, our brains are always trying to find patterns in randomness.  I remember there used to be something called the “superbowl” indicator where someone figured out that if a team from the old AFL won the superbowl it predicted with 90% accuracy what the stock market would do that year.  Of course it eventually stopped working so well because it was just the human brain trying to fit a pattern to random historical data.  The other thing is that even when there is a consistent pattern, if the pattern is detected by enough traders, the form of the pattern will be changed by their trading.  For example, suppose a stock always went up on Thursday morning.  Traders would start buying like crazy on Wednesday afternoon in anticipation, which would make the stock go up Wednesday afternoon instead of Thursday morning.",Total-Business5022,14,/r/investing/comments/n7pr3w/do_individual_stocks_have_their_own_personality/gxe2fpl/,0.027,0.883,0.09,0.8313
148,NFLX," This question would do better in the daytrading subreddit, I think.

When I started trading I treated all stocks the same, and for a long while that meant I would consistently underestimate TSLA and sell too low too soon, or expect a correction that never came, meanwhile I'd overestimate NFLX just a little and set limit orders a bit too high so that it never sold before coming back down. After a while you do get a feel for how certain individual stocks behave, you adjust accordingly and when you do better with day trading or swing trading those stocks specifically, it can encourage you to focus on a group of favourites that you're familiar with. When you're looking at something new, I found it good practice to try and estimate a good entry before buying, wait and see how close you were, and hold off buying until your estimates are close to what happens. Following that with discipline has saved me from more FOMO mistakes than it has cost me lost opportunities. 

Anyway, I don't know if I'd go so far as to say they have different personalities, but they certainly follow different patterns.",MonkeyMcBandwagon,4,/r/investing/comments/n7pr3w/do_individual_stocks_have_their_own_personality/gxe8cdw/,0.035,0.871,0.095,0.8628

150,AAPL," You might say the larger, more liquid stocks have personalities. This is due to the options market. Institutions will often make bets on large individual names to complement their bets on indices as part of their risk management strategies.

Can you learn this easily on your own? Probably not. Traders trained at these institutions can qualitatively understand these flows and who the players might be. Everyone knows a particular hedge fund likes to make bets on AAPL for instance. Then they build a model to optimize their strategies accordingly. But it's unlikely you'll learn that on your own. You'll just see a bunch of correlations and you won't really understand why they exist.
