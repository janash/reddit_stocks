4,DD," This post sounds like you telling people to cause a dump much more than it sounds like a warning for their money. 

IMHO it would be stupid to take profits before the end of the second quarter to see revenue. But if you think this growth hasn‚Äôt been healthy and there‚Äôs going to be a huge selloff then we‚Äôre just going to disagree. 

For sure, a lot of people will take some profits but don‚Äôt act like you know the majority‚Äôs mentality. 

Also, 5.83% of float is short. That‚Äôs not most people shorting. That‚Äôs an overwhelming majority of people who are long.

7,ZOM, Potential is often worth more than reality. I successfully swung this stock from 0.90 to 2.44 and I‚Äôm more than happy with those gains. ZOM doesn‚Äôt even own all the patents in Truforma and the companies evaluation is insane right now. In a few months when ZOM is back at 2$ have fun being long term investors instead of taking profit and moving into another high growth stock. Meanwhile I moved my profits into multiple stocks that already printed.

19,MVIS," FWIW this stock has been talked about on a lot of subs for the past 4-5 months. I first did a hard look into it in January after it had moved up a bit and I'm sure people were on it before then. It's important to understand though that everything looks more enticing once the momentum has built. One of my current holdings is MVIS. One year ago that stock was $0.15. It is speculated that it may be purchased for anywhere from $30-$100 per share this year by an acquiring company (obviously nothing is for sure yet). That means if I put the amount I invested into Microvision a year ago instead of January, I would have millions of dollars by now and multi-millions by the time the company is purchased or enters a strategic partnership. You have to understand that the playing field before the stock has popped is a very different environment though. There simply isn't a reality that I would have bought into Microvision at that point because it's just not my investment style. I would have seen the stock, thought it was too high risk putting money into it and forgotten about it.

Think I might drop a few other positions I am not really firmly locked into as well as see how things fair tomorrow. If the dips get more apparent, I'll hop on them.

106,DD," I can explain this. I used to mod here.

I helped write the rules back when I was a mod and we had 6,000 members or so. It was me (MoonYachtCaptian), DJ Hamster, and Fiveones back then.

We always had memes and shitposts. The flair always existed.

Now that we have so many users and so much content being posted, we have more shitposts and memes than ever. The meme content generally gets more upvotes than DD, News, or Research which sends it to the top faster than the more productive content.

It can be irritating that you need to dig for good info.

I suggest sorting by New, rather than Hot or Top. And using the search bar to find posts flaired as DD, Research, or News. You'll effectively eliminate the stuff you aren't interested in.

We can also reduce spam and garbage by flagging posts that break the rules or have improper flair. The current mods are volunteers so they cant manually review every post as it's posted.

Following redditors is great way to get the best DD. We have some very diligent researchers who participate regularly who don't get the upvotes and awards they deserve. 

I hope this helps. I understand that it's getting hard to find the OG users and genuine DD you can use. I feel your pain, that's part of why I stepped down as mod.

108,RH," The 4/16 $5 call still has some time until expiration.  When you sell options, don't get excited and rush to adjust.  Remember the primary purpose of selling options is to collect premium and have the option expire worthless meaning share price closing below $5 on 4/16 and you retain the shares.  Then it's just rinse and repeat selling a call again for May which should become available soon.

If the stock runs up and gets above $5, you can look to roll the calls out (extend date) or up and out (extend date and raise price).  In order to execute a simultaneous roll on RH, you need level 3 options permissions.  If you don't have that, then you will have to buy to close the first call and then sell to open the second.

The indicated value you are seeing on RH is the current price for the option, not your returns.  Your returns were added to your account as soon as the sell order was filled, now it's just determining if you want to try to retain the full premium collected and let the option expire or buy to close when you have reached a certain % gain.",Busy_Print6699,1,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/m5vnpx/daily_discussion_thread/gr609bw/,0.024,0.903,0.073,0.7943

115,TRCH," Like the person above me said, but here are the bullish and bearish points for the dividend.

BULLISH: Oil and gas are coming back, so the land may have more value than if this had taken place a year ago. Management really wants a healthy dividend for themselves so they can make some money 

BEARISH: The lands are speculative and have not produced encouraging results when testing. The buyers know the sellers are on a deadline, so TRCH can't command top dollar or a bidding war for the land. 

I'll hope for $.25 and be pleasantly surprised if its more, but I honestly lean bearish on the dividend so I would be very surprised if it's over $1.00. 

Position? Yes I do own shares.",Cardinalsfan5545,1,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/m5ym1j/price_of_new_ticker_will_be_price_of_trch_at/gr35lgd/,0.074,0.695,0.232,0.9699
116,TRCH," No it's not. It's only a great deal if the dividend is good. TRCH holders get a 1:1 MMAT share true but MMATF holders get 3:1. It's clear which is the better deal. Market cap also won't just quadruple because of merger so share price will plummet.

151,VERY," I didn't say you are a bag holder. I said that promoting the ""diamond hands"" meme is just a tactic to get people to bag hold. If someone is telling you to bag hold, 99 times out of 100 it's because they have shares of that stock and the value of their shares is tied to your decision on whether to join in a sell off or to hold and help keep the value high. So people on places like WSB have learned that if they make ""diamond hands"" seem like a virtue and attack ""paper hands"" people as being pathetic, scared, panic decision making losers then they can sway others to help hold a stocks value higher allowing them to sell (or sell at a higher price).

It's a clever tactic, but it's VERY much predatory of new investors.",abjectWinnuh,7,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/m65wct/big_news_zom_284_and_raising_will_explode_today/gr4otkm/,0.072,0.751,0.177,0.8151
152,ZOM," Why would you think this statement is directed at you? A current bagholder of ZOM would be someone that bought during the week of February 8th at a price per share between $2.67 and $2.91. It hasn't been above $2.59 during market hours since that week.

They're saying that buying this high is risky. There's no guarantee it will go higher from here.

As for their competitors and market value, I'd just point out the posts from the last month or so from people that work in vet med or asked vet med professionals, and the overwhelming response has been that the current system isn't a big enough hassle to justify buying their expensive product. Obviously, sometimes consumers don't know what they actually want, but that's a concerning opinion from potential buyers to me if I'm holding ZOM.

And while I'm not OP, I'll say that I swing traded ZOM during that aforementioned week for a 12% gain and haven't owned it since. If I would have had any free capital, I would have definitely bought when it nosedived to $1.40 on 3/5 though.",badger0511,4,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/m65wct/big_news_zom_284_and_raising_will_explode_today/gr4739a/,0.016,0.886,0.098,0.9387
