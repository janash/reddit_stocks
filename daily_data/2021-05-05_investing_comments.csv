10,PTON," Is that a joke? It’s an exercise bike. You named a few competitors. Google it and you’ll find dozens more. 

The software side has competition from wearables and other IoT devices that will imitate the subscription aspect of pton but you will be able to use with basic exercise bikes. 

PTON is a trend. A huge percentage of exercise enthusiasts will return to gym when they are comfortable post COVID. Those who prefer at home workouts will have a huge range of options to choose from. Do I think the company is going to zero? Definitely not. Their product is quality and they have a following but the growth opportunities do not support the sky high valuation. 

The argument that PTON has a moat is laughable in my opinion. Nothing they do is hard to copy. And it’s overpriced as hell which really limits their market share. Cheaper models are coming but they will find even more competition at those levels. 

Just my thoughts. Please downvote me and inform me why PTON is so wonderful and ahead of the competition all you want. It’s just wishful thinking",hugsfunny,1,/r/investing/comments/n5jtkv/peloton_pton_recalls_its_tread_and_tread/gx276cb/,0.065,0.747,0.188,0.977

12,PTON," Well, a quick google search gave me the result where 72 people filed a complaint with Peloton about their Treadmill. 

Doubt that 72 individuals with 72 individual lawyers will be suing the same company at the same time. So this will be a class action lawsuit where the 72 will be bundled up into 1 case.   


So lets say PTON settles and gives each person $100,000 (more for more seriously injured people, etc). Settlement will be at least 7.2 million. And no judge is awarding $1,000,000 per client which you can google so I made the assumption of at least $100,000 since only a small amount of people are badly hurt and 1 is dead.  


This will affect their Balance Sheet in the short run of course. But not addressing it and ignoring it will increase the cost of future lawsuit settlement. So recalling it the machines and making full refund and addressing the public basically puts a cap on the cost of this mistake.  


So I expect the next 3-4 quarters to be shit for PTON because they have to lawyer up and pay settlement. But will this bankrupt PTON and will this affect PTON's future aspirations?

Depends on how negligent PTON was. If they received THAT many injury complaints and then received warning from the CPSC and took weeks or months to issue a recall, it does not look good in court. It shows wanton carelessness for consumer safety.

Futures are higher this morning, rebounding from the ‘Yellen head-fake’ that caused a bunch of selling yesterday afternoon. Small caps are leading the move higher, with the Russell 2000 up 0.7%. Nasdaq is up 0.6%. S&P and Dow up about 0.3%. Russell and Nasdaq also saw the brunt of the damage yesterday, giving up almost 2% each.

We do get to hear from a couple of FOMC members: Eric Rosengren, Loretta Mester, and Charles Evans. Not sure if they’re taking questions but if so you can bet they’ll be asked about Yellen’s comments.

Too cold and the economy is not recovering quickly or strongly enough. Though nowadays, maybe the ‘too cold’ scenario is preferred.

Do you want to prepare for possible sickness and hospital bills when you are old?
Do you want to travel, see the world, enjoy luxuries?
Do you just want to escape the rat race and have the option to do what you want to do?

52,JBHT," ""How long will this rotation to value continue?""

It's not even necessarily ""value"" - I mean look at something like Old Dominion (ODFL) - up about 20% in a couple months. They have been hiring significantly and that's a high quality business that can pass off higher costs.  People don't have to buy oil cos that have provided disappointing returns for half a decade or more; look at ODFL's long-term chart. JBHT too - these are things that have actually delivered consistently for shareholders over the long-term.

Railroads/logistics and other infrastructure plays, Visa/Mastercard. Financial exchanges. Surging ag prices and land values can lead to more spending on Deere (and probably Tractor Supply.) What are staples that can raise prices? Even very high-end luxury - LVMH raised prices in the midst of the pandemic. What can pass off/benefits from higher costs?

It doesn't mean ""get rid of all your tech"", but if you have a portfolio that is basically a tech fund it might be a more difficult year than the ""this is too easy"" year last year. People can perhaps consider a more focused portion of their portfolio for growth that is concentrated in their best ideas.

If I wanted inflation protection and needed it from something commodity related I'd probably go with a foreign metals miner, probably in Australia. Purchasing power parity says as inflation goes up relative to another country's currency, so does the inverse in regards to price. So if you are holding a miner in AUD you benefit from high profits from high commodity prices and another bonus once converting back to home currency.

94,USA," Hello

I am 47 live in USA. I have about 40k in savings and I am unemployed. My wife is a Pharmacist and make around 120k a year. We own our house but she has a big student loan around 200k.

We have no kids and no big debts other than the student loan.

I was wondering what would be a good investment with my savings. Willing to invest maybe 5-10K to start.

Theoretically, could I do naked puts up to that margin balance and if I was assigned, sell off a majority of the shares? For example, could I do a naked put on $AAPL at $125 for May 7 expiration, and if I was assigned 100 shares, buy on margin, and sell 90 of the shares to pay back the margin balance, and then pay for the 10 shares?

The question seems to have obvious answers, like ""to grow my money!"" or ""to be wealthy!"" If we could avoid those answers just for this topic.

But I am looking for the emotional why, the real reason why people want to invest or grow their money. During these times it seems like there is always another hidden layer…

Do you invest to protect your future, so you can retire comfortably?
Do you want to make sure you have the money to pay for your child's education?
Do you want to prepare for possible sickness and hospital bills when you are old?
Do you want to travel, see the world, enjoy luxuries?
Do you just want to escape the rat race and have the option to do what you want to do?
My emotional why, is to give my family a better future. To be able to afford a home where we can grow together and of course stop having to pay rent.

What is your emotional why? I would love to hear from all of you. Feel free to DM me if you do not want to answer publicly.",true_ink,0,/r/investing/comments/n5bh4l/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gx1zmy1/,0.031,0.731,0.238,0.9929
