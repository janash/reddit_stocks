Then I saved bit of money for few months praying AMD should not rise too much. Took margin, Added some money from my wife's account. Finally bought $55K worth of AMD in 2017. I kind of bought in batches spread across few months (1000, 2500,1000 kind of)

I used to wake up every morning and check my AMD portfolio at one time I was in red with $14K in negative. I just held on because the company was posting good results.

The automatic wipers are now employing the first production deep neural network trained with over 1 million images for the detection of water droplets in a windshield and additional weather cues.”

Here's the deal, all AI will be worse than simple manual/semi automatic setup until it gets to know the driver better (or collecting more data).  Just like the Nest themo stat - it's a pain to use when first install but over time, it learns your schedule and does a better job.

81,AI," SQ all the way. If we assume that AI/ML is an upcoming gold rush, the companies with the most data to train will, in my opinion, likely be the victors. SQ’s blend of eCommerce (Weebly) and physical POS give them unbelievably granular data at the per-transaction and per-customer level, ie they can see the cost and items sold for both physical and virtual storefronts and create customer profiles across both media. Facebook/Google know your identity and when you click an ad, but don’t always know whether or not that click resulted in a completed transaction, and almost certainly don’t know the exact items purchased and total cart value. They have to infer while Square knows.

As an example, they’ve started to monetize this data with their commercial loan offerings. They know a company’s SKUs, sales, and unique customers and tailor loan packages based on that. The rate and length are, I assume, likely calculated based on the transaction history for the company and the results for loans made to similar companies. Square can use data to define their default risk at a level most banks cannot. Square has mentioned in previous calls how low their default rate is compared to industry. The loans are repaid on a fixed amount, per-item basis instead of with traditional amortization. Business owners I’ve chatted with love it because it helps stabilize their cashflow while using the loan to grow business. That is, for a $1,000 loan: “pay Square 50 cents per cup of coffee until you’ve repaid $1,032” vs “pay Chase $86.07 per month for one year”. Square knows the company will likely sell 2,064 cups of coffee in a year based on the individual transaction history for that vendor. I know the loans are currently a small portion of revenue, but I think represent where the company is headed as far as monetizing their treasure trove of data to create entirely new products or reimagine traditional financial products.

107,BP," It's the tax reason dude. Biden tax plan will essentially double my tax if it passes in its current form. The $170 is where I think it should be valued and would probably be my re-entry point should I get back into SQ. I'm not worried about it getting down to $170 at all. I can care less. I already sold bruv. At $200-$225 prices unfortunately. 

There was a lot of reasons for me to sell SQ right now. Top reason: securing the bag. Second reason: taxes. Those are easy to understand. But my biggest concern outside those two is the market pressure put on $SQ. I don't think there is anything fundamentally wrong with it. It's just the fundamentals are completely overblown in the stock price. It's $100B company with less than $10B revenue and less than $200M profit. Talk about future earnings getting pulled back. It was even more looney when you realize it's price was almost $300 a share. 

Another precarious situation is cathie wood and her ARK funds. If shit get bad and redemptions happen to her fund, you're going to see another Archegos situation all over again...only this time it will be BAD. 

Anyway, I'm on the Michael burry train of inflation. I went from a lot of tech to massive diversification in things like KR, BP, and WFC. I'm no longer playing offense to grow my portfolio.

108,KR," It's the tax reason dude. Biden tax plan will essentially double my tax if it passes in its current form. The $170 is where I think it should be valued and would probably be my re-entry point should I get back into SQ. I'm not worried about it getting down to $170 at all. I can care less. I already sold bruv. At $200-$225 prices unfortunately. 

There was a lot of reasons for me to sell SQ right now. Top reason: securing the bag. Second reason: taxes. Those are easy to understand. But my biggest concern outside those two is the market pressure put on $SQ. I don't think there is anything fundamentally wrong with it. It's just the fundamentals are completely overblown in the stock price. It's $100B company with less than $10B revenue and less than $200M profit. Talk about future earnings getting pulled back. It was even more looney when you realize it's price was almost $300 a share. 

Another precarious situation is cathie wood and her ARK funds. If shit get bad and redemptions happen to her fund, you're going to see another Archegos situation all over again...only this time it will be BAD.

258,PT," Nah, Chewy has no defensive moat whatsoever. I did an analysis on them last month and recommended shorting the company. 

Their business is highly replicable and their margins suck. Petco is the better long-term bet.

The short recommendation panned out since I posted the article when it was trading at $84.04 with a PT of $65. I recommended selling on 5/12 at $67.72 for a 19%+ gain and the next day, 5/13 it broke below $65 and achieved my price target. 

I'm all for the pet industry but I don't believe that Chewy can command a high multiple like that given the pending onslaught of competition in the online pet delivery space.

276,GME," Chewy has not nearly came close enough to beating Amazon. Amazon is still miles ahead in every metric like revenue. And Chewy had first mover advantage unlike GME.

So people would sell their old games to GameStop? What would GameStop do with all those old games no one wants? This sounds like an easily to replicate system where the only way to differ from competitors is offering more money for peoples old games, which surely sounds like a profitable businesses model.

If people want to trade games with each other, god damn Reddit has a sub for that r/gametrade. Why would people trade through GameStop’s platform for them to take a cut? You mentioned game progress and saves being included, but that already happens when people sell accounts to others. Besides, if a random Redditor like you or me can know this information, you’d think Microsoft devs would write a few lines of code to make that an optional feature of gifting games and eliminate the need for a middleman like GameStop, again!

Are you really going to say GameStop will have lower prices then AMAZON? Amazon is the king of cutting prices and driving others out of businesses. Do you think 12B GameStop with half a billion in cash can take on Amazon in e commerce? People use Amazon because prices are low, it’s the dominant e commerce market place, and it has big scale and companies it works with. I can refund my Amazon packages at the local Kohl’s.

287,AAPL," First, don't pay attention to analyst price targets.  Any one company's target is meaningless.  Go to [CNN Business](https://www.cnn.com/business).  Put in AAPL, then go to the ""Forecasts"" tab.  What you'll see is the high, median, and low analyst forecast.  $90 is the lowest one.  The median - that's the most common value - is $160.  The high is $185.   If you look on the left you'll see that these are Hi/Med/low drawing from the forecasts of 40 analysts.  That's a large sample.  

So, you see lots of analysts have a much higher target.  BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN ANY OF THIS WILL COME TRUE.  OK?  They're just guesses.  

Now I'm going to explain to you the proper basics of charts.  OK?  Go to [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/).  Enter AAPL.  Go to Full Screen.  Set the chart to ""max"".  Go to ""settings"" in the upper right.  Change the Y-axis scale to Logarithmic.  It's a pain but try to rescale the chart so it shows the last 10 years.  OK.  Find the draw tool in the upper right of hte chart.

Draw a line connecting all the lows after 2012.  Then draw another line connecting all the highs after 2012.  The band defined by the two lines is APPLs long term growth trend and trading range.  You can see the current price is \*\*\*way\*\*\* above the long term trading range.  

Now, if you look at the recent and future earnings, you'll see that APPL's earning look kind of like it's price chart - long term trend of steady growth, then rapid growth during the pandemic.  But if you look at the future earnings projections by those same 40 analysts, you'll see that the \*future\* earnings are projected to grow much more slowly than earnings grew during the pandemic.  And \*that\* my friend, is probably why some analysts have a low price target - they predict that slowing growth is going to hold back the stock price.  

My personal opinion is that the short term prospect for the stock is on the low side of the range on Yahoo.  The long term prospect for AAPL is sound as always.  

However, I don't know how much you make, but $100 loss on a stock is like pennies.  If you're not willing to risk $100, don't buy stocks.  

So I can't tell you whether you should buy or sell.  I would not \*buy\* AAPL at the current price.  But selling it to save a $100 is hardly worth the bother in my opinion.  That's ice cream and bubble gum money.",hendrix_srv,28,/r/stocks/comments/npk966/investments_in_blue_chip_stocks_advice_requested/h05n2jb/,0.05,0.826,0.125,0.9887
288,TRUE," First, don't pay attention to analyst price targets.  Any one company's target is meaningless.  Go to [CNN Business](https://www.cnn.com/business).  Put in AAPL, then go to the ""Forecasts"" tab.  What you'll see is the high, median, and low analyst forecast.  $90 is the lowest one.  The median - that's the most common value - is $160.  The high is $185.   If you look on the left you'll see that these are Hi/Med/low drawing from the forecasts of 40 analysts.  That's a large sample.  

So, you see lots of analysts have a much higher target.  BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN ANY OF THIS WILL COME TRUE.  OK?  They're just guesses.  

Now I'm going to explain to you the proper basics of charts.  OK?  Go to [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/).  Enter AAPL.  Go to Full Screen.  Set the chart to ""max"".  Go to ""settings"" in the upper right.  Change the Y-axis scale to Logarithmic.  It's a pain but try to rescale the chart so it shows the last 10 years.  OK.  Find the draw tool in the upper right of hte chart.

Draw a line connecting all the lows after 2012.  Then draw another line connecting all the highs after 2012.  The band defined by the two lines is APPLs long term growth trend and trading range.  You can see the current price is \*\*\*way\*\*\* above the long term trading range.  

Now, if you look at the recent and future earnings, you'll see that APPL's earning look kind of like it's price chart - long term trend of steady growth, then rapid growth during the pandemic.  But if you look at the future earnings projections by those same 40 analysts, you'll see that the \*future\* earnings are projected to grow much more slowly than earnings grew during the pandemic.  And \*that\* my friend, is probably why some analysts have a low price target - they predict that slowing growth is going to hold back the stock price.  

My personal opinion is that the short term prospect for the stock is on the low side of the range on Yahoo.  The long term prospect for AAPL is sound as always.  

However, I don't know how much you make, but $100 loss on a stock is like pennies.  If you're not willing to risk $100, don't buy stocks.  

So I can't tell you whether you should buy or sell.  I would not \*buy\* AAPL at the current price.  But selling it to save a $100 is hardly worth the bother in my opinion.

291,AMD," Rule 1 of investing. Never invest money you aren't prepared to lose. ESPECIALLY day trading.

I can't sure with certainty, but it sounds like you may have done that, when you said ""I am really worried"". 

Sure, nobody wants to see their investment go down, ad a little worry is always part of it, but ""really worried"" leads me to believe you aren't following rule 1. 

Of course, I can't truly read your emotion over text, so if you feel okay about it, forget what I said. But I figured I should just let it be known.

Edit: to add to this. If you feel like you're worried too much, pull out. You may be at a 5% loss now, and see that as a had investment, but it's still a net gain over a potential 10% loss. 

Ad it all comes down to DYOR (do your own research). You can read what the analysts are saying, and what Redditors are saying, etc. But ultimately, if you want to make money investing, you need to make your own decisions, and that starts with research. 

Analysts and Redditors can be part of the research, but you should also pay attention to company announcements, earnings reports, dividend history (if applicable), etc. 

For example, I've been back and forth on buying AMD for the past little while. But just this morning I heard about their partnership with tesla, and I believe that could push AMD forward, and I just so happen to have a bit of extra cash right now, so I plan to buy a few shares, all based on my own research and opinion. It could backfire, but I made the decision on my own accord, and believe in it.",bugtimtim,3,/r/stocks/comments/npk966/investments_in_blue_chip_stocks_advice_requested/h06jcdn/,0.09,0.835,0.075,-0.3261

333,AMD," QFIN - 38.06%: A Chinese payment connections service with an enormous addressable market, QFIN is by far my favorite stock at the moment. It’s borderline impossible to find a company with margins, ROE, ROCE, and historical earnings CAGRs this high, let alone at a P/E this low (7.2 at its current price). They have a strong brand, the business model is highly scalable, management appears competent, transparent, and experienced, and they performed far better than their competitors during the pandemic, with lower delinquency rates and a lesser earnings loss. They’ve done an incredible job of expanding into new revenue streams and maximizing capital efficiency. I could sing this company’s praises all day long, but suffice to say I’m already up ~80% and plan to ride it higher.

HIFS - 18.50%: This is my newest position, and at the moment my only loser (although it feels unfair to call it a loser after a drop of under 1% in the mere month or so that I’ve owned it). HIFS is a family-operated, regional S&L that operates in the Boston area (with an expansion to D.C. in the works), pursues extremely safe lending practices (loan losses are consistently well below the industry average, and were barely significant even during the Global Financial Crisis), and is by far the most capitally efficient bank I’ve ever seen. Its core net profit margins are well over 40%, and GAAP net profit margins are sitting at 58.7% for the past year. That would be insanely high for even a software company, let alone a bank. The bank’s owner-operators are practically obsessive about cost-cutting to the point where management recently announced that they would no longer issue press releases for the declaration of dividends, instead communicating that through quarterly and annual reports. Why? To cut costs. How many corporate management teams would even think to do that? There are very few certainties in the stock market, but I know of at least one: if you invest in HIFS, your money will be managed responsibly and with the goal of getting the absolute most out of every dollar.

BRK.B - 18.13%: Berkshire Hathaway needs no introduction. Investing in BRK is essentially allowing your money to be managed by the most successful investor in human history. Many think Buffett is “past his prime”, but at the very least, you can trust him to act rationally and with the best interests of his shareholders in mind. It also doesn’t hurt that Berkshire gives me indirect exposure to some of the best businesses on the planet.

INTC - 11.55%: Intel has faced significant criticism in the past for a failure to innovate and stay ahead of technology trends. This is somewhat true. Multiple generations of Intel management sat on their hands as AMD, TSM, and Arm gained significant ground on the technology front. That being said, I believe wholeheartedly in Pat Gelsinger (the new CEO) and his vision for Intel. He has his fair share of critics, but he has at the very least revitalized the company. Whether he is leading them down the right path or not remains to be seen, but he is at least leading them somewhere. The financials still look great, and INTC has the resources to annihilate their competitors so long as they execute well. Mobileye is also a very promising AV subsidiary, and could prove to be the eventual market leader in AV software and hardware.

FL - 11.24%: Foot Locker, to me, exemplifies the term “durable competitive advantage”. There’s a couple of benchmarks I like to use to determine this. Firstly, if the company has sold the same product for the past decade, and is likely to do so for the next decade, it probably has a durable business model. Foot Locker sells shoes. They’ve sold shoes for their entire existence. People will always need shoes. That’s a durable business model. Secondly, to determine brand strength: if you can picture their brand in your head without having to look it up, that’s a strong brand. Everyone knows Foot Locker’s brand. You know the employees’ referee-style uniforms, and the logo with the red lettering and a silhouette of one of those referees. Lastly, think about how much it would cost to effectively compete with the company. Foot Locker has a workforce of about 50,000 employees operating over 3,000 brick-and-mortar stores, not to mention a distribution network to support their e-commerce segment. This translates to repeating operating expenses of about $2.5 billion annually, not including what’s sure to have been countless one-time expenses Foot Locker had to deal with while building this empire, or the amount of time it took to build the brand recognition and brand loyalty it possesses. All of this just to eek out profit margins of about 6.5% on average. No start-up will ever be capable of effectively disrupting or competing with a company like that. They had their fair share of struggles from the pandemic, but responded extremely well and are now back to (and above) pre-pandemic levels of profitability.

UNM - 2.52%: UNM is my oldest position on this list, and was at one point my largest. It hasn’t exactly fallen out of favor with me, but I’ve obviously found some buying opportunities that I liked more. That being said, it still has a place in my portfolio as a defensive position and a deep value play. Life and disability insurance is a very stable business, especially when you have a balance sheet as strong and a management team as cautious as UNM’s. The dividend is nice (and was recently raised), and share buybacks are set to resume in H2 2021.

This portfolio is focused primarily on the quality of the underlying businesses, with a secondary focus on value. Dividend income is low, but the primarily goal for me at this stage is capital appreciation. I may be somewhat under-diversified in the eyes of some, but I believe what I lack in diversification is made up for in certitude.

Its core net profit margins are well over 40%, and GAAP net profit margins are sitting at 58.7% for the past year. That would be insanely high for even a software company, let alone a bank. The bank’s owner-operators are practically obsessive about cost-cutting to the point where management recently announced that they would no longer issue press releases for the declaration of dividends, instead communicating that through quarterly and annual reports. Why? To cut costs. How many corporate management teams would even think to do that? There are very few certainties in the stock market, but I know of at least one: if you invest in HIFS, your money will be managed responsibly and with the goal of getting the absolute most out of every dollar.

BRK.B - 18.13%: Berkshire Hathaway needs no introduction. Investing in BRK is essentially allowing your money to be managed by the most successful investor in human history. Many think Buffett is “past his prime”, but at the very least, you can trust him to act rationally and with the best interests of his shareholders in mind. It also doesn’t hurt that Berkshire gives me indirect exposure to some of the best businesses on the planet.

INTC - 11.55%: Intel has faced significant criticism in the past for a failure to innovate and stay ahead of technology trends. This is somewhat true. Multiple generations of Intel management sat on their hands as AMD, TSM, and Arm gained significant ground on the technology front. That being said, I believe wholeheartedly in Pat Gelsinger (the new CEO) and his vision for Intel. He has his fair share of critics, but he has at the very least revitalized the company. Whether he is leading them down the right path or not remains to be seen, but he is at least leading them somewhere. The financials still look great, and INTC has the resources to annihilate their competitors so long as they execute well. Mobileye is also a very promising AV subsidiary, and could prove to be the eventual market leader in AV software and hardware.

FL - 11.24%: Foot Locker, to me, exemplifies the term “durable competitive advantage”. There’s a couple of benchmarks I like to use to determine this. Firstly, if the company has sold the same product for the past decade, and is likely to do so for the next decade, it probably has a durable business model. Foot Locker sells shoes. They’ve sold shoes for their entire existence. People will always need shoes. That’s a durable business model. Secondly, to determine brand strength: if you can picture their brand in your head without having to look it up, that’s a strong brand. Everyone knows Foot Locker’s brand. You know the employees’ referee-style uniforms, and the logo with the red lettering and a silhouette of one of those referees. Lastly, think about how much it would cost to effectively compete with the company. Foot Locker has a workforce of about 50,000 employees operating over 3,000 brick-and-mortar stores, not to mention a distribution network to support their e-commerce segment. This translates to repeating operating expenses of about $2.5 billion annually, not including what’s sure to have been countless one-time expenses Foot Locker had to deal with while building this empire, or the amount of time it took to build the brand recognition and brand loyalty it possesses. All of this just to eek out profit margins of about 6.5% on average. No start-up will ever be capable of effectively disrupting or competing with a company like that. They had their fair share of struggles from the pandemic, but responded extremely well and are now back to (and above) pre-pandemic levels of profitability.

UNM - 2.52%: UNM is my oldest position on this list, and was at one point my largest. It hasn’t exactly fallen out of favor with me, but I’ve obviously found some buying opportunities that I liked more. That being said, it still has a place in my portfolio as a defensive position and a deep value play. Life and disability insurance is a very stable business, especially when you have a balance sheet as strong and a management team as cautious as UNM’s. The dividend is nice (and was recently raised), and share buybacks are set to resume in H2 2021.

This portfolio is focused primarily on the quality of the underlying businesses, with a secondary focus on value. Dividend income is low, but the primarily goal for me at this stage is capital appreciation. I may be somewhat under-diversified in the eyes of some, but I believe what I lack in diversification is made up for in certitude. Any input would be appreciated :)",nuclearboy197,1,/r/stocks/comments/nppkp4/rate_my_portfolio_rstocks_quarterly_thread_june/h08nm4t/,0.064,0.762,0.174,0.9991
339,UNM," QFIN - 38.06%: A Chinese payment connections service with an enormous addressable market, QFIN is by far my favorite stock at the moment. It’s borderline impossible to find a company with margins, ROE, ROCE, and historical earnings CAGRs this high, let alone at a P/E this low (7.2 at its current price). They have a strong brand, the business model is highly scalable, management appears competent, transparent, and experienced, and they performed far better than their competitors during the pandemic, with lower delinquency rates and a lesser earnings loss. They’ve done an incredible job of expanding into new revenue streams and maximizing capital efficiency. I could sing this company’s praises all day long, but suffice to say I’m already up ~80% and plan to ride it higher.

HIFS - 18.50%: This is my newest position, and at the moment my only loser (although it feels unfair to call it a loser after a drop of under 1% in the mere month or so that I’ve owned it).

385,BABA," They don’t invest in BABA, they invest in SEHK:9988. Which is the real and only listing for Alibaba. BABA is just an offshore holding company without even holding any rights to Alibaba as a company, just a “right” to BABA profits.

Second, you don’t even own Alibaba when you buy their stock, you own an off-shore holding company located in the Cayman Islands or something which is in agreement with BABA and the CCP.
