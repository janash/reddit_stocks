0,GDP,"It's a bubble overall, and particularly in certain sectors and definitely certain companies.

Even if you think there are good reasons to explain why the prices have risen, stock pricing eventually all goes back to its ability to produce returns for investors.  When prices rise so high that future earnings do not provide a return to match the kind of risk that investors are taking, at some point you will get a correction.

Explanations like increased money supply or GDP growth do not dispel the idea of a bubble since if it was just inflation or increased economic actrivity, then you'd expect future earnings would also rise and your P/E would not get so out of whack.

Explanations like more people getting in on the market does not dispel the idea of a bubble since you still have the problem of the price getting way too high for the future earnings.  More people getting into the market explains *how* the bubble is being created, not that the bubble doesn't exist.

Similarly, explanations like a lack of reasonable alternatives due to low bond yields again explain how the bubble is being created, but still does not address the core problem of future earnings not being enough to justify the price.  Yes, lack of alternatives will increase investors' tolerance for lower returns from stocks, but only to a certain extent because of the level of risk.  You wouldn't accept a 1% return on stocks over a 0% return from bonds if there was a chance of a 50% drop on the stock price due to it being overvalued.  You'd hold more of your money in commodities or even cash, or swap over into better value stocks.

Having said all that, I still do not expect the bull run to end any time soon.  Investors are still very bullish with the post-COVID recovery and all of the stimulus being pushed into the economy.",0.071,0.803,0.126,0.9222

So if you're printing on overdrive but institutions aren't lending, what happens?  In Canada, they don't really have other options, so they lend anyway and we get (for example) a housing bubble that has been continuing to grow since the US one popped.  In the US, however, the repeal of Glass-Steagall means if banks don't feel like lending, they can take all that new money and roll it into financial markets instead, where money velocity tends to be lower.  And as we all know, the beauty of financial market math is that the mere act of money flowing in causes valuations to increase regardless of what the economy actually does.

18,IMO,"IMO, it's even more specific - it's companies valued like tech that aren't really tech that are overvalued.  Look at the FAANGs, the best examples of true tech companies, which have absurd margins because their costs are so low.  That's what tech is for me - when technology allows scaling beyond other businesses.

Compare Apple with Tesla - Apple's gross margin on an iPhone is 60-70% while Tesla's most popular car, the Model 3, has a gross margin around 10%.  This means Apple is basically printing money with every one of their phones they sell, and can afford to take big risks, try new businesses, etc, while Tesla struggles to break even.  It's not really a fixable problem - it's just a lot cheaper to make a phone compared to what people are willing to pay for it than a car.

The same goes for the other FAANGs - Google, Facebook, Amazon's costs to host pale in comparison to the money they bring in for ads/hosting fees.  Compare that to some of these companies with ridiculous P/E and thin margins - that are valued like the early days of the big tech companies, but without the same scaling advantages.  2 of my go-to examples are Vail Resorts (MTN) and Chipotle (CMG) - each having P/E around 200.

China and the USA have never, and will never, be friends. China was the friend of the oligarchs that wanted cheap manufacturing costs. China has gone from 'cheap manufacturer' to 'nearly #1 economy in the world' in the span of 20 - 30 years.

They are increasingly militaristic and assertive in their 'control' ideology (look at Hong Kong, South Pacific Islands, etc). 

**Why should someone be bearish?**

Just look at any asset class, including things like paintings, antiques, etc. They're universally inflated in cost. People are desperate to put their cash into something that has upside value.

When everyone is putting their money everywhere, that signals a massive bubble in nearly every sector. Giving everyone 'free money' that's making < $75,000 year will prop up non-discretionary purchases (consumer staples), but isn't going to prop up the rest of the inflated sectors.

The March 'correction' wasn't a correction. It was a selloff for temporary fear of the virus. This does not count as a 'selloff' in the traditional sense. We recovered far too fast, and will fall far harder in the near future.

All they can do is prop up the stock market to make things look better than they are. Wall Street may look good but Main Street is feeling the pain.

It’s possible that the global economy is just in a stable infinite slow inflation. Which means we’ll just continue as we are now with the central banks propping up the stock markets. Rich get richer, poor get poorer. Middle class dies.

But it also feels like we’re in the biggest global debt bubble in human history. If things keep up like they are now, there could be cascading defaults of ungodly amounts of debt starting at the bottom and going all the way to the top. Fed will respond to this with extraordinary inflation. The moment that inflation escapes to the consumer market, it’s probably game over runaway inflation. The whole world will be dumping dollars for any concrete asset.

It’s also possible that continued pain on main street will force actual significant direct stimulus to Americans, which could push us into hyperinflation directly.

74,GM,"I think that ford is riding on GM's coat tails but the reasons that GM is rising in value do not apply to Ford.

Factors that caused GM to rise in value:

* GM announces BrightDrop commercial ev subsidiary.
   * this announcement actually directly competes with and harms Ford's business. Ford has a significant commercial division and they just announced a commercial ev with roughly 150 miles of range. GM's commercial truck has 250 miles. With battery degradation, this difference matters. GM is the clear winner here.
   * GM also announced a software suite and logistics service to accompany their commercial evs. Another potential source of revenue.
* GM announces that cruise raises $2b from Microsoft and Honda at $30b valuation
   * With a 70% stake in cruise GM owns roughly $20b of cruise. This means that subtracting this $20b from GM's market cap, other than cruise the rest of GM's business is worth $60b. This puts GM at almost 6x forward pe and this values GM's ev business and commercial ev business at 0. In my opinion GM is severely undervalued here.
   * Cruise is one of 2 companies (the other being Waymo) putting autonomous vehicles on roads without anyone behind the steering wheel. The holy grail of self driving cars is not just being able to get from point a to point b without driver intervention. It's getting from point a to point b without anyone in the car. Only cruise and Waymo have demonstrated that they are close to this. I think if cruise were to ipo today it would be worth much more than $30b. Note that this is not bullish for ford.
* GM announces it will be using it's ultium platform to build evs for Honda and Acura brands
   * another new source of revenue that does not benefit Ford
* GM announced that they will release 30 new ev models by 2025
   * if we take them at their word this means at a certain point a new car will be coming from GM every 3 months.

&#x200B;

So really, the only thing I think Ford has going for it is that it has released a beautiful car in the Mustang Mach E. But I don't think it's enough. Right now we are in a supply constrained market for EVs and once more cars start hitting the market this is where GM will shine with their superior battery platform and superior autonomous driving capabilities.

Additionally, large pension funds, IRA's, and other investments that need a caluclated risk purchase bonds since their value is less susceptible to short term volatility. Many investors like the stability over more potential growth. For example, if you had $1M, you could invest 800k in stocks and 200k in bonds, that would be a very common 80/20 split that provides good upside, with less volatility than 100% equities. You said ""bonds got crushed"" since march. I am assuming you mean bond yields got crushed, which is true since the Fed began massive bond purchasing since March, but bond yields are inverse to their price, so bonds actually became and ARE (still) very expensive relative to their norm, so if you purchased in late February, and sold in April, you would have dont much better than equities did at that time. 

You sound young when you say ""stocks gain value back quicker"". 2020 was an anomaly like never in history. Japans 90s stock market crash and deflationary spiral took nearly 20 year for stock prices to recover. They called the 90's the lost decade. The dot com bust took 7 years to recover, and the Great Financial Crisis in 2009 took 4 years to recover.

This current market is juiced by exceptionally low interest rates which has allowed companies to borrow money and issue debt at unprecdently low rates, allowing them to thrive. On top of that you have this incredibly investing momentum driver by low rates (people searching for return) that is self-feeding.

We are in a completely unprecedented time in which the US has unsustainable debt, the FED is ultimately ""printing money"" out of thin air, and at some point... the check will come due. It may be 2021, or 2025, or 2030, but the debt always comes due, and we will have repercussions, i am sure.

32 years old/USA, married with two small children (2 yrs and 4 yrs). No debt besides mortgages. Approximately $200K annual total household income.

Currently live in a SFH with $178K mortgage, $300K value. Possibility to walk away with $100K cash if we sell. We are under contract on new SFH. Will have $250K mortgage, $400K value.

After new purchase, we will have $200K cash left to invest and our old SFH which we can either sell to add another $100K cash totaling $300K cash.

Does anyone have any advice on next moves for us? Should we rent our SFH that we are moving out of to see some cash flow. I would expect an additional $6000 a year in cash flow if we were to rent, but I'm nervous since the house was renovated and we weren't expecting it to be a rental when we bought it and renovated.

In light of COVID and potential supply chain issues that may strain the cash flow cycles of businesses, gaining an understanding of a company’s receivables concentrations, how long it is taking for them to collect on their receivables, and the likelihood of not being able to collect on those receivables (depending on days past due) may be beneficial as well for your analysis.

For example, if the concentrations of their revenue sources don’t appear to coincide with historical statements, that may not necessarily indicate a deviation from their core business activities. Instead, the company could have a few of their primary customers that are taking longer to pay the company.

I buy 100 shares of XYZ for $100/share, and ten days later sell them at a loss. The loss is tax deductible - no wash sale has occured (unless I buy the shares back within 30 days).

I buy 100 shares of ABC for $100/share. Two months later I buy another 100 shares (it doesn't matter if I pay more or less than $100 per share). A week later I sell 150 shares at a price lower than both of my purchase prices, realizing a loss. 100 shares of that transaction is a wash sale, and the loss will be disallowed.

The difference is that the 100 shares I bought right before the loss sale were adding to an existing position. The rule exists so that you can't buy more shares in an existing position with the intent of selling them quickly for a deductible loss.

So if you buy into a position all at once - you are free to harvest a loss at any time. If you've been buying into a position in numerous chunks over time, to be safe your loss sale needs to be more than 30 days after your most recent buy.",0.112,0.77,0.118,0.3009

I thought you'd see a pullback in growth, but nope: still doing well in the new year.

280,CCL,"It’s the similar to why casinos offer free drinks - sometimes small snack items - for people playing their games. You see all the free items you’re getting and psychologically will want to spend more, thinking you’re the one getting the good deal either way.

The less these cruises can offer initially, the less temptation consumers will feel to buy add-ons. Plus, cruiseliners - CCL especially - are meant for families who normally aren’t great at controlling their spending habits. They sell lower quality items that pass off as higher quality for a medium quality price. Rings, clothes, etc. Many of those people who normally go for those buys will have been affected by a covid economy. 

So imo cruiselines with reduced assets and fewer over-spenders will need a new draw, since the ticket to ride really isn’t where they make their money. Alcohol is the only item that would probably stay relatively the same, since drinking is about the only thing that almost no one knows how to budget.

Certainly see your side of it, but I think you’re coming from the perspective of someone who has the finances to overspend on quality items or service. Most publicly traded Cruises are made to cater to a different concept of luxury.

""For those who don't know, Peter Schiff is the CEO of Euro Pacific Capital, a hedge fund that's perma-bullish on gold.""

The thing that I don't like about Schiff is that he's a broken record; I don't like people who are the same thing over and over again and the years pass and they're wrong and any alternative manner of thinking other than their own is met with ""no no no."" It's sort of futile to debate because they're going to keep hitting the same one note over and over and over (and over) again. John Hussman is the worst example of this.

""Wrong and stubborn is a combination that we earnestly try to avoid."" - Michael C. Aronstein

""Is the whole bitcoin vs. gold debate""

Schiff can have his gold, his son can have his bitcoins. Too many people turn asset classes or specific investments into a religion, becoming uber-defensive and ready to debate anyone who dare not agree with them - happily oblivious to any potential negatives.

This is not strictly correct. Yes, if you buy/sell shares of a company in the open market (i.e. after the IPO), the company doesn't directly get any of that money, but an increase in stock price does benefit the company indirectly. For instance:

* Company may issue secondary offerings and raise more money. Tesla has done this, a number of recent SPAC mergers have done this. QS did this a few weeks ago.
* If employees get shares as part of their compensation, a rising stock price makes it easier to attract and retain talent, which helps the company improve or grow the products.",0.037,0.697,0.266,0.9869
