Even if you think there are good reasons to explain why the prices have risen, stock pricing eventually all goes back to its ability to produce returns for investors.  When prices rise so high that future earnings do not provide a return to match the kind of risk that investors are taking, at some point you will get a correction.

Explanations like increased money supply or GDP growth do not dispel the idea of a bubble since if it was just inflation or increased economic actrivity, then you'd expect future earnings would also rise and your P/E would not get so out of whack.

Explanations like more people getting in on the market does not dispel the idea of a bubble since you still have the problem of the price getting way too high for the future earnings.  More people getting into the market explains *how* the bubble is being created, not that the bubble doesn't exist.

Similarly, explanations like a lack of reasonable alternatives due to low bond yields again explain how the bubble is being created, but still does not address the core problem of future earnings not being enough to justify the price.  Yes, lack of alternatives will increase investors' tolerance for lower returns from stocks, but only to a certain extent because of the level of risk.  You wouldn't accept a 1% return on stocks over a 0% return from bonds if there was a chance of a 50% drop on the stock price due to it being overvalued.  You'd hold more of your money in commodities or even cash, or swap over into better value stocks.

Having said all that, I still do not expect the bull run to end any time soon.  Investors are still very bullish with the post-COVID recovery and all of the stimulus being pushed into the economy.",0.071,0.803,0.126,0.9222

4,GDP,"Actually your very own logic shows that you DO think we're in a bubble, even if you don't suppose it will pop any time soon. I don't want to get too deep in semantics, but generally speaking, I would say an increase in stock prices that doesn't have a robust economic foundation should be labeled a bubble. And a simple growth in the money supply is not, in my view, a solid economic foundation. There is a reason economists distinguish between things like nominal GDP and real GDP.

Taking a step back, recall that M2 money increases when deposits are created. Most deposits are created in the form of loans (though they may also be created when the Treasury deposits physical cash into its account at the Fed). Deposits can be created by banks up to a limit, and by the Fed with no limit. M2 deposits increased very dramatically this past March because the Fed began purchasing a much wider variety of assets than it has ever purchased before.

One of the core purposes of money is to facilitate economic activity, and therefore money \*generally\* tends to increase as the economy grows. But as you allude to (and as [this](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=Aesk) graph more explicitly shows), the money supply has been increasing faster than real GDP growth for the last 40 years--and the divergence continues to get larger. The effect this has on the stock market is... controversial. Personally, I think you are right when you allude to the additional money being used to increase the price of financial assets such as stocks. But this is just circular logic to some extent. It's not clear \*why\* or \*how\* additional money might be bidding up stocks at a rate that exceeds GDP growth to a greater and greater extent.

Now there are certainly reasons to believe this trend could continue, but there are also reasons to believe it could reverse. Politicians could drive money away from financial markets, e.g. by significantly raising taxes on capital gains or by increasing regulations on certain unproductive financial activity (such as blatant speculation and gambling). Since growth in the money supply is not \*real\* economic growth, so to speak, there is nothing to anchor stock valuations that are mostly being driven by a simple increase in the money supply. This is why I am not hesitant to call the current market a ""bubble"", even though I don't see it popping any time in the foreseeable future. But if Biden decided to raise taxes on financial assets and clamped down on financial speculation, while simultaneously financing government programs that increase labor share of national income, the stock market could be in for a rough ride. I don't think Biden will do this, but some other politician might eventually give it a try. After all, it's becoming more and more accepted that financialization of the economy is at least partly contributing to an increase in inequality.

In summary, I would certainly agree that there is a relationship between M2 money stock and the growth of the S&P, but I would not say that growth is very robust. It could vanish as quickly as it appeared, although I don't think it'll be the current political administration that triggers the decline.

This is compounded by the fact that real economic malaise is also present and has been for some time - so even if there was some room for expansionary policy, it would be lipstick on a pig.

So if you're printing on overdrive but institutions aren't lending, what happens?  In Canada, they don't really have other options, so they lend anyway and we get (for example) a housing bubble that has been continuing to grow since the US one popped.  In the US, however, the repeal of Glass-Steagall means if banks don't feel like lending, they can take all that new money and roll it into financial markets instead, where money velocity tends to be lower.  And as we all know, the beauty of financial market math is that the mere act of money flowing in causes valuations to increase regardless of what the economy actually does.

21,IMO,"IMO, it's even more specific - it's companies valued like tech that aren't really tech that are overvalued.  Look at the FAANGs, the best examples of true tech companies, which have absurd margins because their costs are so low.  That's what tech is for me - when technology allows scaling beyond other businesses.

Compare Apple with Tesla - Apple's gross margin on an iPhone is 60-70% while Tesla's most popular car, the Model 3, has a gross margin around 10%.  This means Apple is basically printing money with every one of their phones they sell, and can afford to take big risks, try new businesses, etc, while Tesla struggles to break even.  It's not really a fixable problem - it's just a lot cheaper to make a phone compared to what people are willing to pay for it than a car.

The same goes for the other FAANGs - Google, Facebook, Amazon's costs to host pale in comparison to the money they bring in for ads/hosting fees.  Compare that to some of these companies with ridiculous P/E and thin margins - that are valued like the early days of the big tech companies, but without the same scaling advantages.  2 of my go-to examples are Vail Resorts (MTN) and Chipotle (CMG) - each having P/E around 200.

There are but they are mostly dying or bleeding red from their blood losses.

I always feel bears are stupid and on the wrong side since market theory/history is that pies are growing. However current situation is tons of massive worldwide stimulus, worldwide central bank printing, ease of ""free"" RH investing, everyone stuck at home, and insanely bullish sentiment means that bears are getting killed to the point they are extinct or barely holding on.

On the flip side, I do feel bears are a necessary part of the market eco-system just like how fungi, viruses, rats, bugs, plankton, or scavengers are necessary in their eco-systems. Bears have the unenviable job of being the ones that take massive risks with possible 100% or more wipeout losses in what are often short term or semi-long TRADES in markets that are in theory constantly growing and moving upward.

Problem is when the bears get slaughtered hard right now. Even big institutional bears are getting slaughtered on shorting weak/meme stocks by meme gambling addicts/kids on WSB. In fact, they are hunting for short squeezes now. You know you're in a bubble or are due for a correction when there is no one to stop the bulls from running wild.

45,RH,">I am curious if there are any more bears left. 

There are but they are mostly dying or bleeding red from their blood losses.

I always feel bears are stupid and on the wrong side since market theory/history is that pies are growing. However current situation is tons of massive worldwide stimulus, worldwide central bank printing, ease of ""free"" RH investing, everyone stuck at home, and insanely bullish sentiment means that bears are getting killed to the point they are extinct or barely holding on.

On the flip side, I do feel bears are a necessary part of the market eco-system just like how fungi, viruses, rats, bugs, plankton, or scavengers are necessary in their eco-systems. Bears have the unenviable job of being the ones that take massive risks with possible 100% or more wipeout losses in what are often short term or semi-long TRADES in markets that are in theory constantly growing and moving upward.

Problem is when the bears get slaughtered hard right now. Even big institutional bears are getting slaughtered on shorting weak/meme stocks by meme gambling addicts/kids on WSB. In fact, they are hunting for short squeezes now. You know you're in a bubble or are due for a correction when there is no one to stop the bulls from running wild.

46,USA,">China is finally coming to an end as China and US move towards friendship once again.

China and the USA have never, and will never, be friends. China was the friend of the oligarchs that wanted cheap manufacturing costs. China has gone from 'cheap manufacturer' to 'nearly #1 economy in the world' in the span of 20 - 30 years.

They are increasingly militaristic and assertive in their 'control' ideology (look at Hong Kong, South Pacific Islands, etc). 

**Why should someone be bearish?**

Just look at any asset class, including things like paintings, antiques, etc. They're universally inflated in cost. People are desperate to put their cash into something that has upside value.

When everyone is putting their money everywhere, that signals a massive bubble in nearly every sector. Giving everyone 'free money' that's making < $75,000 year will prop up non-discretionary purchases (consumer staples), but isn't going to prop up the rest of the inflated sectors.

The March 'correction' wasn't a correction. It was a selloff for temporary fear of the virus. This does not count as a 'selloff' in the traditional sense. We recovered far too fast, and will fall far harder in the near future.

55,USA,"Define bearish. Most of my money is in cash+gold. I do have a small amount invested and I am waiting for prices to lower for DCA.

We can name any number of bullish or bearish factors, but what it boils down to for me is: massive overvaluation.

There is no way you are going to make money in the long term paying $400 for a stock that's worth $200. In that case you are just waiting for earnings to catch up with it's price. Also never forget that in 10 years time, $400 is going to be worth less than $400 today.

The idea that stocks ""always recover"" is also flawed. Europe is collapsing, so is the USA. European stocks have not recovered since the 2000 crash and they probably never will. Japan never recovered from it's stock market crash either. Add into this that these currencies have been devalued ever since and it's pretty obvious that massive amounts of money have been lost. USA is next. Maybe it's this crash, maybe the one after that. But there will come a time where the USA's irresponsible insanity will catch up to it, and we are going to have a lot of eternal bag holders when that happens.

All they can do is prop up the stock market to make things look better than they are. Wall Street may look good but Main Street is feeling the pain.

It’s possible that the global economy is just in a stable infinite slow inflation. Which means we’ll just continue as we are now with the central banks propping up the stock markets. Rich get richer, poor get poorer. Middle class dies.

But it also feels like we’re in the biggest global debt bubble in human history. If things keep up like they are now, there could be cascading defaults of ungodly amounts of debt starting at the bottom and going all the way to the top. Fed will respond to this with extraordinary inflation. The moment that inflation escapes to the consumer market, it’s probably game over runaway inflation. The whole world will be dumping dollars for any concrete asset.

It’s also possible that continued pain on main street will force actual significant direct stimulus to Americans, which could push us into hyperinflation directly.

80,GM,"I think that ford is riding on GM's coat tails but the reasons that GM is rising in value do not apply to Ford.

Factors that caused GM to rise in value:

* GM announces BrightDrop commercial ev subsidiary.
   * this announcement actually directly competes with and harms Ford's business. Ford has a significant commercial division and they just announced a commercial ev with roughly 150 miles of range. GM's commercial truck has 250 miles. With battery degradation, this difference matters. GM is the clear winner here.
   * GM also announced a software suite and logistics service to accompany their commercial evs. Another potential source of revenue.
* GM announces that cruise raises $2b from Microsoft and Honda at $30b valuation
   * With a 70% stake in cruise GM owns roughly $20b of cruise. This means that subtracting this $20b from GM's market cap, other than cruise the rest of GM's business is worth $60b. This puts GM at almost 6x forward pe and this values GM's ev business and commercial ev business at 0. In my opinion GM is severely undervalued here.
   * Cruise is one of 2 companies (the other being Waymo) putting autonomous vehicles on roads without anyone behind the steering wheel. The holy grail of self driving cars is not just being able to get from point a to point b without driver intervention. It's getting from point a to point b without anyone in the car. Only cruise and Waymo have demonstrated that they are close to this. I think if cruise were to ipo today it would be worth much more than $30b. Note that this is not bullish for ford.
* GM announces it will be using it's ultium platform to build evs for Honda and Acura brands
   * another new source of revenue that does not benefit Ford
* GM announced that they will release 30 new ev models by 2025
   * if we take them at their word this means at a certain point a new car will be coming from GM every 3 months.

&#x200B;

So really, the only thing I think Ford has going for it is that it has released a beautiful car in the Mustang Mach E. But I don't think it's enough. Right now we are in a supply constrained market for EVs and once more cars start hitting the market this is where GM will shine with their superior battery platform and superior autonomous driving capabilities.

All of them try to convince regulators with ""data"" that their cars are so safe, which won't fly. The main reason is that self-driving cars *aren't* safer. They could be in some fairy tale universe with more computational power available, just not this one. For the price of a FSD package, one can buy ten cars, and then it still doesn't work. Self-driving is a fashion accessory that can kill you. 

I think building a self-driving car is possible; I don't think it's possible right now to build one economically. I have been saying that for 11 years now.

Additionally, large pension funds, IRA's, and other investments that need a caluclated risk purchase bonds since their value is less susceptible to short term volatility. Many investors like the stability over more potential growth. For example, if you had $1M, you could invest 800k in stocks and 200k in bonds, that would be a very common 80/20 split that provides good upside, with less volatility than 100% equities. You said ""bonds got crushed"" since march. I am assuming you mean bond yields got crushed, which is true since the Fed began massive bond purchasing since March, but bond yields are inverse to their price, so bonds actually became and ARE (still) very expensive relative to their norm, so if you purchased in late February, and sold in April, you would have dont much better than equities did at that time.

I like both ARM and NVDA but the two of them being in one company hampers ARM's core strength: They're a design house, not an SOC vendor. There are a lot of ARM vendors out there precisely because of that - they don't have to approach ARM as a potential competitor that they need to do business with. They know their business interests are aligned.

NVDA buying ARM changes this dynamic. Sure, the regulators will ask NVDA to put all kinds of firewalls around ARM not to affect other ARM vendors. But even that won't be enough IMO.

Meanwhile, if NVDA wants to utilize ARM's personnel to design their own SOCs (say, like Apple), well, that works well if you're not planning to sell your chips (say, like Apple!) A marketable core needs to have the tradeoffs you need when you sell to multiple customers. So I don't see why NVDA would need direct access to ARM to design and sell a custom SOC or anything like that. Doesn't make much sense to me.

Currently live in a SFH with $178K mortgage, $300K value. Possibility to walk away with $100K cash if we sell. We are under contract on new SFH. Will have $250K mortgage, $400K value.

After new purchase, we will have $200K cash left to invest and our old SFH which we can either sell to add another $100K cash totaling $300K cash.

Does anyone have any advice on next moves for us? Should we rent our SFH that we are moving out of to see some cash flow.

I buy 100 shares of XYZ for $100/share, and ten days later sell them at a loss. The loss is tax deductible - no wash sale has occured (unless I buy the shares back within 30 days).

I buy 100 shares of ABC for $100/share. Two months later I buy another 100 shares (it doesn't matter if I pay more or less than $100 per share). A week later I sell 150 shares at a price lower than both of my purchase prices, realizing a loss. 100 shares of that transaction is a wash sale, and the loss will be disallowed.

The difference is that the 100 shares I bought right before the loss sale were adding to an existing position. The rule exists so that you can't buy more shares in an existing position with the intent of selling them quickly for a deductible loss.

So if you buy into a position all at once - you are free to harvest a loss at any time. If you've been buying into a position in numerous chunks over time, to be safe your loss sale needs to be more than 30 days after your most recent buy.",0.112,0.77,0.118,0.3009

In light of COVID and potential supply chain issues that may strain the cash flow cycles of businesses, gaining an understanding of a company’s receivables concentrations, how long it is taking for them to collect on their receivables, and the likelihood of not being able to collect on those receivables (depending on days past due) may be beneficial as well for your analysis.

For example, if the concentrations of their revenue sources don’t appear to coincide with historical statements, that may not necessarily indicate a deviation from their core business activities. Instead, the company could have a few of their primary customers that are taking longer to pay the company.

The less these cruises can offer initially, the less temptation consumers will feel to buy add-ons. Plus, cruiseliners - CCL especially - are meant for families who normally aren’t great at controlling their spending habits. They sell lower quality items that pass off as higher quality for a medium quality price. Rings, clothes, etc. Many of those people who normally go for those buys will have been affected by a covid economy. 

So imo cruiselines with reduced assets and fewer over-spenders will need a new draw, since the ticket to ride really isn’t where they make their money. Alcohol is the only item that would probably stay relatively the same, since drinking is about the only thing that almost no one knows how to budget.

Certainly see your side of it, but I think you’re coming from the perspective of someone who has the finances to overspend on quality items or service.

314,QS,">the company gets a cash injection when their shares initially go to market, but after that when shares change hands, there's no mutual benefit

This is not strictly correct. Yes, if you buy/sell shares of a company in the open market (i.e. after the IPO), the company doesn't directly get any of that money, but an increase in stock price does benefit the company indirectly. For instance:

* Company may issue secondary offerings and raise more money. Tesla has done this, a number of recent SPAC mergers have done this. QS did this a few weeks ago.
* If employees get shares as part of their compensation, a rising stock price makes it easier to attract and retain talent, which helps the company improve or grow the products.",0.037,0.697,0.266,0.9869

Yes, it competes against other companies, but it succeeds because it's the most efficient and beneficial to consumers.  In your specific example, it sounds like you want finance companies.  I'm personally invested in IPOE which is a SPAC that will reverse merge with a company called SoFi.  SoFi is Social Finance.  They are an upcoming and fast growing fintech company whose ethos is to do banking ethically and in a digital and modern way.   Check them out.
