0,EIC," people called it all kinds of everything because when you start looking into FOMO Corp, you get confused between the old company name and ticker and description... very confusing!!!!!

now people will be able to understand what the name of the company is, the descriptions will be updated and current, their ticker will line up with the company name. 

In a few weeks the Smartguard acquisition will close and that will add some significant value to the company.

Then next time we get a big PR about a contract secured by Smartguard (which they have plenty in the pipeline we have been led to believe) this will run pretty good. 

That's also not counting anything Purge Virus or EIC comes up with, the Ecolite and HVAC acquisitions, and much more.

That's why I'm only bullish for next 12-18 months depending. They let the price of crude run and US shale has private equity pile in which is good for our pennies and prodiction but when OPEC+ decides to suppress the price it will crush them with debt.

 IRW-PRESS: Exploits Discovery Corp.  : Exploits Receives Drilling Permits at Jonathans Pond
 Vancouver, British Columbia, May 6, 2021 - Exploits Discovery Corp. is pleased to announce that the Company has received full drilling permission from the Newfoundland and Labrador government on the Jonathans Pond Project (the Project) in Newfoundland.
 Highlights

 - Exploits has received diamond drilling permits for twelve holes totaling approximately 3,000 meters on the Jonathans Pond Project
 - The drill program will focus on testing two targets:

 - JP Vein: This is located in the Gander River Ultramafic Belt (GRUB) Line Fault Zone.  As part of the fall 2020 mapping, the structural boundaries of the gold mineralization were outlined, with surface sampling showing outcrop grab samples of up to 28.0 grams of gold per tonne and channel sampling of 0.44 grams of gold per tonne over five meters.
 - Demagnetized Fault Zone: This is located approximately 1.5 kilometers northeast of the JP Vein and consists of a pronounced two kilometer long demagnetized geophysical fault zone containing high-grade historical heavy mineral concentrates (SMK) of up to 410,000 parts per billion and floating boulders with up to  Matching 700 grams of gold per ton on the property.  This goal was achieved through a combination of structural field mapping and geophysical data analysis techniques from Goldspot Ltd.  described.
 - Exploits team is now in Newfoundland to finalize plans for fully funded spring and summer drilling programs at 12,000 meters and has received drilling permits for all five initial targets
 Michael Collins, President and Chief Executive Officer of Exploits said, “It's great to have all five drill permits.  In eight months the company has defined and approved high grade gold drill targets and will be drilling in May.  With a resurgent gold market and other companies doing great results in Newfoundland, Exploits is well positioned to create value for our shareholders through the discovery in 2021.",Famous_Ask_5214,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/n5y395/the_lounge_thoughts_noob_stuff_low_effort_brokers/gx4xj2c/,0.073,0.845,0.082,0.6207

54,RS," The tech service penny stocks I am in have all been decimated. $DTGI, $ATDS, and $IWSY. 

I feel good about DTGI and will hold onto it until it gives me a reason to doubt beyond the market conditions. It's a good company with growing revenues, good leadership, good on most every metric except they carry a lot of debt and haven't clawed their way to profitability yet. I think the next year will see a lot more continued growth for them and they will get there, so I'm going to keep buying.

ATDS has something going on behind the scenes... The company has increasing revenues and seemed to be digging its way forward, but something has seriously spooked investors to see a massive sell-off over the past few days. There is talk of RS, and of course there is on-going dilution. Seems like there's something else though... company is putting out good work, good PR, they purchased another company earlier this year that is used by several major organizations, etc. I hope management will address investors soon to calm things down. 

IWSY is actually holding pretty steady at the moment, but maybe that is because it already dumped off awhile ago. The management team has been completely rebuilt with some great people who are highly capable. They recently announced plans to increase share ceiling from 1 to 2 billion though, partly to pay employees in stock and prevent the company from being targeted for a hostile take-over. Haven't announced any big deals yet though. Hopefully something big comes down the pipeline soon.",steveissuperman,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/n5y395/the_lounge_thoughts_noob_stuff_low_effort_brokers/gx6ssdg/,0.047,0.767,0.186,0.9905

I don't think you will find a penny rail stock.  I do think there are a few companies that stuff for the rail industry that are pennies (sorry don't remember their names).  Think one is the company that makes all the train cars and another that makes the latches.  Try that as they would be needed no matter what for ANY of the different train companies.

77,SO," They most definitely can be traded pre and after hours. You need to fill out paper work(read: internet documents) stating that you're knowledgeable about OTCs and have a want to trade after hours.

The fees for these trades are dependent on the broker you use. Some have a fee of .0005¢ PER SHARE so if you're trading something that is below a penny it wouldn't really be viable. Some have a fee of $50 per trade, which is only viable if buying a decent amount of shares.

There are SO MANY things you can do in the financial markets that the ""average investor"" has no clue about. A simple Google of ""can I trade OTC stocks after hours"" would have answered your question.

I'm contemplating creating a thorough advanced investing program/course after I get my masters in accounting in order to profit off of people's unwillingness to look up free information themselves.

The company did not perform well for the majority of the previous decade. Poor management was a reason, but so was not having a product that withstood FDA trials.

Over the last three years two of three prominent candidates in the pipeline have shown promise with passing stage 1 and 2 FDA trials, pending FDA 3rd trial. The management team has expanded with more talent brought on with a focus on late stage drug development. More doctors were added to the pool for research development also. 

The stock itself has been one of few that held on after the pump during the penny stock / small cap pharma stock surge in late 2020. It rose from 0.80 to 2.40 and found solid support at 2.00. Institutional money has kept the stock afloat during the pull back, and total share of the pie from Institutional investors has grown considerably over the last year. 

Ultimately, the firm needs positive news regarding the FDA approval process for the stock to grow rapidly. It essentially needs one of the candidates approved within the next two years to not collapse on it self. This is a reality for the majority of small cap pharmaceutical companies. So it's nothing out of the ordinary, it's always a gamble with these companies. 

My personal average cost basis is 1.76 with 3900 shares.",MoosPalang,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/n61yuo/good_penny_stocks_at_the_moment/gx4nydv/,0.014,0.834,0.152,0.988
