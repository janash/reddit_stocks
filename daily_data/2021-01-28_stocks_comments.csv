Dear Honorable Representative/Senator,

I am writing to you today because of the recent events that occurred in the stock market. Specifically, the surge of Gamestops’ stock price. As an average U.S. citizen, it is inherently corrupt to restrict my ability to make decisions regarding stocks while large financial institutions and investors can operate without the exact same restrictions I face. 

Action must be taken to provide power to the players, who work minimum wage jobs, those in college loan defaults, and simply want to change the market to benefit the average person. It is not okay to protect these large financial institutions and brokerages who place profits over people.

I would like to see you act on the topic of market manipulation by these large financial institutions. Please stand up for your constituents, those who elected you to protect and serve our democracy.

COPY AND PASTE THE FOLLOWING TO SEND YOUR CONGRESSMEMBERS:

Dear Honorable Representative/Senator,

I am writing to you today because of the recent events that occurred in the stock market. Specifically, the surge of Gamestops’ stock price. As an average U.S. citizen, it is inherently corrupt to restrict my ability to make decisions regarding stocks while large financial institutions and investors can operate without the exact same restrictions I face. 

Action must be taken to provide power to the players, who work minimum wage jobs, those in college loan defaults, and simply want to change the market to benefit the average person. It is not okay to protect these large financial institutions and brokerages who place profits over people.

I would like to see you act on the topic of market manipulation by these large financial institutions. Please stand up for your constituents, those who elected you to protect and serve our democracy. 

Do not let donations from these institutions and big money steer your own moral compass. I look forward to your response and how you choose to act in this situation.

Thank you.",0.06,0.823,0.118,0.9254

No one actually know this. In fact, there's a very strong argument to be made that this GME foolishness has been a massive gift to the shorts with the deepest pockets, since they likely have the financial backing to close out their positions and re-short at higher levels (this is pretty clearly what's happening based on the short amounts still out there for GME).

In a few weeks -- when GME returns to semi-sane valuation -- I predict we'll learn about how Citadel and Melvin made more money from this than they could have ever have dreamed possible, and a shitton of people on WSB will have been left holding the bag.

WSB's hearts were in the right place, but in the end, I suspect they'll accomplish exactly the opposite of what they think they're accomplishing.

1. They are handling a ***significant*** amount of money
2. This money represents the life savings and retirement plans of ***a lot*** of people. 'Regular' people.

I don't they would ever block a purchase of a security unless they actually believed that fraud was taking place - and then it would be targeted at the people committing the fraud, not a blanket ban on an entire symbol.

187,RH," 

So today is all about psychological warfare. First they restricted people on RH and IB and others from trading then they orchestrated what seemed like a huge sell off.

If you look at the volume, this actually didn't happen though and was all just fake. To understand you need to know how they come up with the price in the chart. Basically if somebody sells a stock for $150 dollar, that's your new value in the chart. So basically what they do is, they sell at 300, then at 299, then 298, and so on. They take on a huge risk by doing this because of course they increase their short positions. They did this a lot in the last couple of days, but today they did it three times in a row pushing the price as low as $120. They were hoping that enough people on Reddit and IB would panic sell (because they're unexperienced) and then are unable to buy back once they realize it was all just for show.

Now the thing that saved the day is that at this point this is not just retail investors. At this point there is other institutional investors involved and of course they immediately saw through tnis, waited it out and now pushed the price right back above 200.

Why 200 you might ask. The highest call that was sold is 200. They're all in the money and some of them expire Friday. What will happen is that whoever sold them needs to buy 100 shares and give them to the call holder. So basically this will lead to very high demand at very limited supply. In fact higher demand than could ever possibly be supplied.

The real short squeeze hasn't happened. It happened today right before the big drop. I know now what it looks like. Straight up, no dips at all. It went up to 420.69, stayed there for a while (because many people set that as a sell price), then went straight to 444.44 (because people like this number too) and so on. They realized how screwed they are and pulled off their last strategy.

All day I said why isn't SEC stepping in, this is clear market manipulation, but I realize now why. This is even bigger than I thought. The broker is responsible for making sure their clients don't lose too much money, i.e. by margin calling them. Now Melvin capitals broker (who by the way owns 40% of RH, sees all their transactions and orders and of course was expected to influence them in this way) knows, that if they margin call melvin, they will not be able to cover the cost. So who will pay the rest? If I understand correctly it is the broker who has to pay the rest. I don't know who that broker is and how they're set up, but they will basically go bankrupt immediately and they might have a huge amount of funds in them suddenly being unable to pay out to their other clients. If this will happen, then a global market crash is almost guaranteed.

So the SEC isn't stepping in, because they don't want this short squeeze to happen. For decades, hedge funds pushed for very loose regulation. Now they've maneuvered themselves into a position of truly infinite loss. I mean at one point I'm very proud of reddit they figured out the loophole, but it's also scary.

I really don't know at this point, what will happen if the squeeze truly happens.

Given how this battle was fought so far, there's probably more dirty tactics coming.",0.107,0.805,0.088,-0.9124

SPY, QQQ, NQ all down while these small cap stuff are exploding upward. So I imagine one of these 3 things is happening:

# Hypothesis 1

**The overall confidence in the market is evaporating due to any number of reasons.** All of these large cap companies have rose since the march will correct downward to realistic numbers removing this covid bull run.

### Evidence 

* The S&P 500 is 6.44% above its 125-day average. This is further above the average than has been typical during the last two years.
* Investors in low quality junk bonds are accepting 2.20 percentage points in additional yield over safer investment grade corporate bonds. While this spread is historically low, it is sharply higher than recent levels and suggests that investors are becoming more risk averse.
* Stocks have outperformed bonds by 1.17 percentage points during the last 20 trading days. However, this is close to the weakest performance for stocks relative to bonds in the past two years and indicates investors are starting to flee risky stocks for the safety of bonds.
* The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) is at 37.21 and indicates that investors remain concerned about declines in the stock market. 

# Hypothesis 2

**The market has been through a change in the administration, and historically the January drift has a few bumps on election years**, this is nothing to worry about and you can probably ignore the drama going on safely. 

### Evidence 

* Since 1930, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has gained an average of 10.0% in a president's first year and 7.9% in the second, [YCharts data](https://go.ycharts.com/how-presidential-elections-impact-the-stock-market-guide).
* This could be a [bear trap](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beartrap.asp), as things have been going well (relatively) with the new administration, and people who have been through trauma are primed to prepare for another tragedy sometimes prophetically. 
* JPOW didn't increase rates, AAPL crushed their earnings, TSLA crushed their earnings, FB even did well. 


# Hypothesis 3

**Reddit using a company with a market cap of 10-20 billion (1/87th of the size of tesla) some how busted one or more hedge funds**... and some how organized the entire internet in a grand David vs Goliath story battling it out and the market is going to crash as a result.

334,RH,"saw this on wSB:

&#x200B;

So today is all about psychological warfare. First they restricted people on RH and IB and others from trading then they orchestrated what seemed like a huge sell off.

If you look at the volume, this actually didn't happen though and was all just fake. To understand you need to know how they come up with the price in the chart. Basically if somebody sells a stock for $150 dollar, that's your new value in the chart. So basically what they do is, they sell at 300, then at 299, then 298, and so on. They take on a huge risk by doing this because of course they increase their short positions. They did this a lot in the last couple of days, but today they did it three times in a row pushing the price as low as $120. They were hoping that enough people on Reddit and IB would panic sell (because they're unexperienced) and then are unable to buy back once they realize it was all just for show.

Now the thing that saved the day is that at this point this is not just retail investors. At this point there is other institutional investors involved and of course they immediately saw through tnis, waited it out and now pushed the price right back above 200.

Why 200 you might ask. The highest call that was sold is 200. They're all in the money and some of them expire Friday. What will happen is that whoever sold them needs to buy 100 shares and give them to the call holder. So basically this will lead to very high demand at very limited supply. In fact higher demand than could ever possibly be supplied.

The real short squeeze hasn't happened. It happened today right before the big drop. I know now what it looks like. Straight up, no dips at all. It went up to 420.69, stayed there for a while (because many people set that as a sell price), then went straight to 444.44 (because people like this number too) and so on. They realized how screwed they are and pulled off their last strategy.

All day I said why isn't SEC stepping in, this is clear market manipulation, but I realize now why. This is even bigger than I thought. The broker is responsible for making sure their clients don't lose too much money, i.e. by margin calling them. Now Melvin capitals broker (who by the way owns 40% of robin hood, sees all their transactions and orders and of course was expected to influence them in this way) knows, that if they margin call melvin, they will not be able to cover the cost. So who will pay the rest? If I understand correctly it is the broker who has to pay the rest. I don't know who that broker is and how they're set up, but they will basically go bankrupt immediately and they might have a huge amount of funds in them suddenly being unable to pay out to their other clients. If this will happen, then a global market crash is almost guaranteed.

So the SEC isn't stepping in, because they don't want this short squeeze to happen. For decades, hedge funds pushed for very loose regulation. Now they've maneuvered themselves into a position of truly infinite loss. I mean at one point I'm very proud of reddit they figured out the loophole, but it's also scary.

I really don't know at this point, what will happen if the squeeze truly happens.

471,GME,"GME was headed toward bankruptcy. This made for an obvious short sale to profit on the decline in stock price. Unfortunately, the Chewy owner joining the board changed the perspective for some folks who started investing (which is also reasonable when the stock is only $4 a share)

But as the stock price continued to go up with speculative buyers jumping on board, the entity that ""borrowed"" the shares for people to sell short gets concerned about the ability for the borrower of the stock to cover (buy back the stock to complete the transaction).

So for example, if you sold short GME at $75 and the price goes up to $150, your broker can automatically close your position without your consent and force a purchase of the borrowed shares at a loss (your loss).

When the price is then elevated higher, due to the forced buys, other short sale transactions that occurred at higher prices can trigger into new forced buys, cascading into more and more forced buying of the shares that were sold short. A short squeeze.

Please keep in mind, these hedge funds have already been squeezed. We are seeing the aftermath of that action.

This forced buying will end after everybody who could be short squeezed gets squeezed. It can't go up forever. When that point is reached however, people might jump back in to sell short, which could (but probably won't) re-trigger the cycle. It won't because you still need the original catalyst that forced the short squeeze, and that catalyst (people buying shares of GME) is not gonna happen at a stock price of over $300 per share for a company that was around $4 a share last year.",0.07,0.845,0.085,0.1114

As I see it theres a few flaws in the logic; as you've pointed out, there is a huge chunk of GME stock in investment funds.

The short numbers have fluctuated a lot recently, so theres surely at least a decent chunk of them who've shorted it at the current inflated pricing. I've yet to hear an actual explanation for why they think the shorts can't just out wait them, when they'll be probably assuming the only force keeping it this high is the current wave of enthusiasm which is likely to be incredibly volatile. I realise they probably do have fees to pay to keep the short when its this high, but the potential gains from the clearly inevitable crash must justify sticking to it for many. It feels a huge gamble to assume that they can keep enough people from selling, when plenty are sitting on massive easy money at the moment.

Arbitrage laws forbid that one exchange can dictate the prices. Hence (taking the FX rate into account) the prices must match world wide. Even if they shut it down for 30 days, they are right back to where they started, if we can hold the prices up high.

2) Exposure could be a problem as well, volatility and leveraged positions can open your entity to serious credit/counterparty risk, especially if you margin call someone that has not enough assets, as this might expose you on both ends, volatility that escapes your risk tolerance/appetite may very well be too much for RM to be still comfortable with. this could very well end up as a matter of self-survival.

Just brokers who margin called hedge funds running up the sell limit order lists as markets are halted every 10 minutes and 1 second as instantly as they open up higher and higher and higher.

Obviously trading apps servers were overloaded on 100% raise in stock price over night. They most certainly will when there is a 1000% raise over night. So in a scenario where there is a squeeze and Robinhood/IB/TDA is overloaded I’m assuming retail not being able to place limit sells even temporarily drive prices even higher just as a default error of how their banking system operates. No broker is going to invest in servers rated for a squeeze or volume of this magnitude when 99.8% of those days they don’t need the capacity. 

Most will miss the very peak. But the top will be there for a few days. In this scenario you should not be worrying about missing out and instead focus on enjoying the ride.",0.056,0.894,0.05,-0.0642

If I believe a stock will go down to 5$ and I short it at 20$ and some internet retards pump it insanely up, then yes I made a huge loss, but now I am looking at a position higher than ever before that could not only cut losses but profit me way more.

Before Monday it was known the short interest went down but not by a lot. After Monday numbers were released and short interest was nearly as high as it was before this thing started.

So if I would think this can only go on so long and I am a hedge fund manager losing its face over some internet kids, the most insane thing to do to come out on top of EVERYONE would be to make this my biggest deal ever by shorting at a time where the entire movement calmed down and stopped.

We already know shorts went back in after Monday. I don't believe that this interest will stop anytime soon until they literally can't cover it anymore.

And its worth the risk. If they think it will go back to 5$ and investing at 20$ was worth it, then 500$ is a fuckin 25x increase of that.",0.085,0.756,0.159,0.9576

Essentially it is a prisoner's dilemma going on:  
(post by me from another thread that explains it)  
Since the owners of all 72M shares of GME are not a 'hive-mind' the question becomes when does profit taking happen from enough individuals to slow the climb and even reverse it into a decline. Just look at a real world example of OPEC where countries would constantly overproduce in order to, essentially, ""profit take."" The Hedge Funds must buy so there are open pocket books.

Depending on how you think that play between the buy needs of the shorts and the profit taking of the current shareholders plays out will fully dictate if you think you should buy in at $290 - $350

1021,GME,"I am also new-ish to investing (Dec 1st) and I did a little reading myself.

The consensus seems to be closest to point 2. Basically hedge funds and short sellers are being battered, and in order to not be forced to close a horrible loss position, are selling profitable stocks elsewhere. This is evidently known as ""de-grossing"" and both Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs have said this is happening on a huge scale.

That said, everybody feels this is kind of unprecedented, and markets generally react unwell to uncertainty. I can definitely imagine a few more conservative investors panicking and selling up / moving to gold / etc.

Worst case scenario is if prices drive down enough, people get spooked and pull out in droves. There could also be a freeze on GME trades as some regulators are proposing.

But today's events should be a clear sign: for all the talk about perfect competition, efficient markets driven by fundamentals and all that BS nonsense, WSB has once again exposed the financial system for what it is, a big, fat sham that favors the few with a disdain for regular Joes. They whine to Uncle Daddy Fed and threaten to punish when they don't get the rate cuts that they want and then turn around and blame the Fed later for keeping rates too low and creating an asset bubble. They get bailed out like they're used to getting bailed out by their rich parents when they were young and play dirty if need be to make sure they come out on top.

\- Car sales in China grew 6.4 percent year-on-year to 2.83 million in December 2020;

\- Commercial vehicles, which constitute around a quarter of the overall market, sales surged 19 percent, driven by government investment in infrastructure and as buyers upgraded to comply with tougher emissions rules. 

\- China Association of Automobile Manufacturers expects car sales to rise by around 4 percent to 26.3 million in 2021.

\- Culture change, China is known for having a culture of buying a new car and maintain it for as long as possible, BUT THIS IS CHANGING! They are now more financial conscious about the choices they make which will impact used cars' market.
