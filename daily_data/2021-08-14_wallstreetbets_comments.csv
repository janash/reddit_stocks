The final straw, I sold some stuff, but their servers didn't push the sale through because they were too busy catching fire - leaving my assets in limbo between ""selling"" and ""sold."" Over the next few hours, market conditions dramatically changed for the worse, but I couldn't cancel the sale because their servers were still on fire and not processing cancelations, either.

Several hours after that, their service was restored - and my sale suddenly processed, despite about 900 cancelations. Took a pretty big loss when I had originally sold at a gain, and what would have been a gain again a few days later.

43,RH," The main takeaway is don’t use RH.

If he were to be assigned then he’d have to short 100 shares of SPY (~$44,600). The risk management team may have seen he didn’t have that much cash/margin and so they closed the trade to avoid having to pay for him if it were to be exercised. It seems they didn’t see his hedge though, or didn’t like what they saw. Basically, “we could cover our ass by using his money to close his trade, or possibly be on the hook to use our money for his trade.”

On one hand I get it, a couple hundred dollars is probably all that’s on the line so moving these larger sums can be a liquidity issue to us small guys. Generally you want to close early anyway to just have those smaller amounts trading (plus avoiding a tax event) even though in the end they should be the same profit, theoretically. He’s in over his head dollar amount wise maybe.

On the other hand though, they let him open it so let him close it too. Maybe send some communication before closing or at least make their determinations transparent.

TLDR, don’t use RH.

RH didn't want to risk spy going UP after close or in the last hour. So they closed him early. Meaning he bought back his short calls that he initially opened for a credit. OP was definitely being sarcastic unless he misrepresented his position. OTM means out of the money. And I'm pretty sure I'm supposed to say ""nobody tell him"" but I'll do you the favor and explain it anyways. RH was protecting themselves from what's called pin risk. Technically op could have lost an infinite amount of money if the calls he sold were naked, but they could have been spreads. 

Edit: even the guy I responded to meant to say ""saved"" him in quotes. The commenter I responded to actually knew the op was being sarcastic.

Edit: they were spreads. His risk was defined so RH probably shouldn't have closed them but it is well known that RH does close 0dte options an hour or two before close.",cookiestonks,7,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p3xblq/robinhood_is_a_scam_i_know_you_know_but_holy_hell/h8w5u2u/,0.057,0.846,0.096,0.7807

I mean *maybe* but that seems unlikely. If you actually go to Robinhood's website and look up option expiration situations they explain that long call calendar spreads *will* be assigned itm--they specifically never say they will sell a full collateralized option spread. Because why would they? I've literally never even heard of a brokerage doing what he's saying unless I'm completely misunderstanding. He has a leaps, and (im assuming) selling calls above his cost basis (but even if not!) as long as the spread is fully collateralized why would they ever close it out?

The body of calls centers at $205, which currently has a premium of $4.30/share. That puts the breakeven above $209.30. There's currently a little almost v-shaped cup-and-handle over the past month, bottoming at $181... beware, though, this v-shape looks problematic, and that may be a false bottom. The real bottom may be in the $190s just eyeballing the price action. The beginning of the handle reversal is at about $197...

So really good earnings and positive sentiment, could it theoretically run 15 pts according to the chart right now? Eh... maybe. I think it could if reaction is really good. In this market, though... could also lose 20 pts LOL.

BTO $440p 8/18 @0.32

STO $439p 8/18 @0.27

Max profit $100, Max loss, $5. The market is pricing it as like a 20 to 1 odds that the SPY doesn't drop by at least 6 points for wednesday.

280,GDP," This statement is factually innaccurate, the Ordovician-Sularian extinction whiped out 86% of life up until last year was always believed to be a low carbon event.  Why did it change?  One paper was published, one.  How scientific does that sound?  The authors tell us why they did it in the paper itself, ""The removal of cooling from the list of Phanerozoic extinction drivers has relevance to the modern phase of global warming: rather than casting doubt on the warming-extinction nexus"".  They wanted to make sure people like you could make the statement you did so they reinterpretated the data and published their theory, go read the paper, they acknowledge the cooling but say it was sandwiched between two volcanic periods.

This sounds like scientists who set out to push their narrative and eliminate any possible evidence against it.  It sounds like the opposite of science because you would expect that CO2 would need a homeostatic level and that there should be deadly periods of low CO2, just a Ph of 7.1 is as deadly as 7.6.  The need to rewrite this history to form a single cause narrative is suspect.

Your statement is inaccurate because you state as fact things that are at best theory.  For many extinction events there is no evidence, and most extinction events have multiple plausible scenarios, some based in catastrophic (asteroid) and others in much slower means (the Permian extinction was what 10-15 million years).

Even if we concede your argument it would take somewhere between 10,000 and 1 million years?  Even the UN report on climate change states they only expect a 4% decrease in GDP worldwide by 2100.  

I'm all for clean energy, but the fear-mongering and bastardization of science needs to stop.  The fact you used the car example you did is a demonstration of how morally bankrupt your argument is, you are using fear to emotionally convince people of things the evidence cannot possibly support.  The fastest extinction event took 100,000 years, and that was only in the ocean, on land it took 3.8 million years.  There is literally nothing humans can do in the next century to stop an event that takes 6 times longer than humans have existed to happen on earth.

368,TV," Bad move imo, CDC approved boosters for Pfizer and Moderna early this morning and J&J got denied approval already.

Full FDA approval is coming down as Biden said it would happen by Labor Day (both Pfizer and Moderna.)

Fauci was on TV today touting the importance of boosters. 

CNN was displaying 100% death survival rate for either vax...(you know boomers will play into buying that.)

2 days ago, it was in the news India was needing 50 million shots, in talks with Pfizer but prob Moderna too. 

Moderna literally can’t make enough covid shots to even fill their back orders. South Korea needed 8.5M shots but they only filled 2.5M, the total contract was supposed to be 40M but doubt that’ll ever happen. (This point may actually help you)

Pfizer and Monderna are raking in billions. RIP to any puts.....it’s just too early I think. 

Next week they’ll both rip. After full FDA approval, they’ll blast.",disisfugginawesome,6,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p3w6tj/im_yoloing_25k_gg/h8v229a/,0.066,0.833,0.101,0.7096

370,BNTX," Moderna ran up before its ER, and the market was waiting for BNTX which was a blockbuster as well, it confirmed their expected results, all of the massive orders and everything else is priced in for the stock which is why it tanked from $490's to $389's, it may continue the trend down to $372 > $362 at the lower level. If I worked at this place I would cash out asap, they all do at these fly by night bio tech research firms. They are hyping cancer cures now, because this Corona vaccine worked they think they can cure cancer, but why all of a sudden, they should have done it before no ? lol. Also if their mRna vaccines are effective against cancer don't worry there will be BNTX + dozens more who can do the same thing. After saying all this, my .02 I would never do a YOLO like this in one shot, maybe 3+3 then wait if it falls more the last leg of the bet +3, also adjust the strike price as it falls accordingly, and have STOP LOSS ORDERS, 3 @ x price then 3 more if the bet goes the other way.
