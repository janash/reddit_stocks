52,RSI," The market is making a steady climb to a bullish peak before it turns bearish for the year. (Happens annually). Check it out:

When you are done trading for the day, set a chart to the symbol $SPXL (It follows the S&P) in the following configuration:

* Time frame = 5 Years. Frequency =  Weekly.
* MACD on (default settings); RSI on (default settings); Slow stochastic on (Default settings).
* Volume not relevant in this research case.

As you can see, the S&P as viewed through $SPXL is headed to an apex.  My personal opinion is that when the annual bear dip does happen it will not be dramatic (We have already taken the economic hit with Covid) but rather a steady downward stair-step of dips and spikes, not falling further than a rising support line e.g.  bull peak of 8/2020? If you were to look at it from a slow stochastic perspective, not dipping below 40.  RSI somewhere around 40.00, and MACD not below -2.00. If that were to be the actual case, it would be a perfect trading scenario for riding the bear dip profitably i.e. slow and steady.

262,INVO," Good feedback. Makes sense regarding the comparison  or embryo transfer to cycle. 

I agree, I don't think it will ever be the standard in IVF. And it will continue to face resistance (see the ""what it has going against it"" section). 

I just think at $37m it's incredibly undervalued compared to the opportunity. I mentioned in a previous comment, even if it is just a small fraction of the IVF market (e.g. $200m) your looking at 5x gains. I think greater than that is entirely possible (just an opinion)

Especially given the low cost of <$50k to set up a clinic enabling emerging economies to have access to a treatment with a much greater success rate than IUI

For example, a single IVF centre in Melbourne, Australia has a market cap of $300m. A single centre. And that's 1 of many in Melbourne. INVO is a global product at $37M. Nothing's a guarantee, but that's where my head's at with it",bazziccio,2,/r/pennystocks/comments/lljxyz/invo_invo_bioscience_375m_market_cap_company/gnqhqxt/,0.011,0.893,0.096,0.8388
263,CEO," Q4 2020 was a reverse split [see this PR release](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/invo-bioscience-announces-1-for-20-reverse-stock-split-301064477.html#:~:text=(OTCQB%3A%20INVO)%2C%20a,by%20the%20Company's%20Board%20of) which in theory shouldn't have an affect on price (as the charts factor this in) but in reality it usually does negatively affect the price as people can be put off by it.

**UPDATE: 20:1 reverse split was in May 2020 when there was also a dip. November 2020 just had the capital raising at $3.20*

In terms of the decline since 2018, in my personal opinion, I put it down to not being adequately funded to take a product global and not following the right strategies at that time. And hitting walls going up against a heavy hitting IVF industry i.e. investors excited for the product but the INVO team not yet turning it into results. 

They changed CEO in Nov 19 and I believe a big reason for this is because of the lack of commercial and business strategy acumen (great product - not so great business acumen). Now it's new board, new CEO and the strategies are more on point. And that's part of what got me excited when doing DD in that the growth phase is still ahead.

From what I see their focus is now on national distribution deals to supply existing IVF clinics and joint ventures for INVOcell only clinics.

265,INVO," Q4 2020 was a reverse split [see this PR release](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/invo-bioscience-announces-1-for-20-reverse-stock-split-301064477.html#:~:text=(OTCQB%3A%20INVO)%2C%20a,by%20the%20Company's%20Board%20of) which in theory shouldn't have an affect on price (as the charts factor this in) but in reality it usually does negatively affect the price as people can be put off by it.

**UPDATE: 20:1 reverse split was in May 2020 when there was also a dip. November 2020 just had the capital raising at $3.20*

In terms of the decline since 2018, in my personal opinion, I put it down to not being adequately funded to take a product global and not following the right strategies at that time. And hitting walls going up against a heavy hitting IVF industry i.e. investors excited for the product but the INVO team not yet turning it into results. 

They changed CEO in Nov 19 and I believe a big reason for this is because of the lack of commercial and business strategy acumen (great product - not so great business acumen). Now it's new board, new CEO and the strategies are more on point. And that's part of what got me excited when doing DD in that the growth phase is still ahead.

269,CEO," FDA approval was back in 2016. Based on what I've read, 2016 to 2019 was a period of start up / learning phase that I refer to above. Honestly I think the team at that stage had a great product created but weren't prepared for the challenges of  bringing a completely new medical therapy to market. Also probably weren't adequately funded for a product that has a global market. 

The catalysts from my point of view are the capital raising in Nov. 2020 and new strategy focused on national distribution deals. Also now opening INVOcell only clinics. All of this was in the last 3-6 months. 

Plus new CEO from Nov 19. Although this was a while ago, the impacts of this change and implementing the new strategies that he brings takes time. 

In other words, I feel they've done the hard yards, faced the initial start up growing pains and now ready to move to the next phase",bazziccio,10,/r/pennystocks/comments/lljxyz/invo_invo_bioscience_375m_market_cap_company/gnq6fj0/,0.045,0.844,0.112,0.8381

UAPC is right at the start of its process. 

Oh and a bit of advice. You don't play how good the company is in the world of OTC. You play it by the catalysts it has coming up, the quality of the share structure, it's financial situation (revenue, debt and cash on hand) and the competency of the CEO. PVDG has the stop sign being removed and then the waves of PR the CEO has been teasing for months.

UAPC has multiple filing stages to go through initially. Plus, we know there's a company coming in which has proven revenue in a hot sector (CBD). Please do enlighten us and share what sort of financial shape Virexit is in?",Allstar9393,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/llh4dx/pvdg_new_coo_announced_ex_microsoft_and_chevron/gnqcfdt/,0.081,0.834,0.085,0.3983
276,DD," Sure. PVDG is coming toward the end of its reverse merged hype. All the filings are complete, the attorney letter is sent etc. It has few catalysts left. The share structure is also poor - it has billions of shares and a massive float. It takes a lot of volume to move the price.

UAPC is right at the start of that process. Former professional wrestler RVD purchased the UAPC shell back in the Summer. They are beginning the process of submitting financial disclosures to OTC to become current. Once that's done he will be reverse merging his RVDCBD company info the shell and changing its name. It's likely he'll use the shell as a holding company for all his companies (RVDCBD, an exports company and a few other acquisitions). RVDCBD has proven revenues - a rarity in OTC.

UAPC has a truly remarkable share structure. Only a few hundred million shares and a low float. This thing has moved from 0.01 to 0.10 (1000%) on such little volume. Once they are current and they are allowed to release PR, it is likely going to fly.

Thus, it leads me to believe that their website is a foray into the world of DTC. Obviously, no wholesaler is going to purchase directly from a website; they make their purchases via coordination with the salespeople of Bergio. Though I wish the website did lack a return policy page, I think it is because they aren't yet even doing DTC transactions.

371,ATNF," $ATNF ... Reason to Buy Today ..

currently $6.75 (2 Day PT: $11... 1-2Mo PT: $20

Cup Pattern: ppl are slowly becoming aware of the company and incredible team & pipeline... and the Price has risen to $6.75 (from initial Drop... see below). It now appears likely to complete the run up back to $11 to complete a Cup pattern by End of week (due to no resistance over $7 bc of initial drop). And due to the Cup Depth of $9 ... the rebound from the subsequent handle has a Price Target of $20 (next 1-2 months). 

At $20 the Market Cap would only be around $400M .. which is likely an accurate current valuation. (Approval of the $7B Phase 3 Drug by EOY would take the share price at very least above $80).  So today is the best timing to get in below $7... and likely take advantage of both the run up to $11 then $20. And be able to hold for bigger potential returns longer term.  

Background/ DD:
180 Life Sciences (ATNF) is a $125M biotech.  Vanguard acquired over 11% stake last week for 2 of its funds. $7B Anti-TNF Drug will get Phase 3 results later in the year (Highly likely approval). Strong Pipeline. The management Team will literally blow you away....they own over 55% of shares which are locked for 12 months & they are talking no salaries. Also, Anti-TNF Platform trials are fully grant-funded through completion % no offerings for at least 3 years.  Stock is about to form a Cup pattern (Cup/Handle).

Management:  ATNF management team is as good as any Large Cap: 2 of the co-founders discovered Anti-TNF Biologics & successfully completed trials phases & approval for the 1st approved Drug in the class- Remicade, which JNJ bought for over $5B. (This class is now the top-selling class of Drugs in the world... ie Remicade, Humira, Enbrel- these 3 alone sold $35B in the US in 2020).  Marc Feldmann won a Lasker award (only 2nd to Nobel) for the discovery.  Anti-TNF is 1 of their 3 platforms.  Another Co-Founder discovered the body's endocannabinoid system & will likely be a 2021 Nobel nominee for formulating synthetic CBD analogs (which is the 2nd of ATNF's platforms).  Additionally, the team collectively have sold Drugs or Companies to JNJ, Amgen, Biogen, and Bristol Myers.. each transaction was over $4B. Team also includes Prior President of Roche Bio, Chair of Clinical research prof at Standford & another with the same title at Oxford. (You can find full bios on 180LifeSciences.com). 

Initial drop: (why so undervalued currently) The company formed via the merger of 3 small biotech through a SPAC that went public 3 months ago. Due to a long clucky SPAC process, with horrible marketing (everyone thought this was a ""european pot stock"" bc the company being acquired was listed as CannaRX Bio- b/c that happen to be the 1 used for paperwork name. Combined this with an offering that included Rights & Warrants, and the multiple extensions- the price of Right & Warrant remained very low & on merge day, when Right converted- the Share Price dropped below $3.  This had nothing to do with the fundamental of the company- but rather an awful SPAC process (the SPAC manager is no longer associated with the company and sold most of her shares past several months (prob to avoid a lawsuit).",SCModerate,5,/r/pennystocks/comments/llp8ms/daily_plays_february_17_2021/gnr6ef5/,0.038,0.914,0.047,0.4684

Strong Pipeline. The management Team will literally blow you away....they own over 55% of shares which are locked for 12 months & they are talking no salaries. Also, Anti-TNF Platform trials are fully grant-funded through completion % no offerings for at least 3 years.  Stock is about to form a Cup pattern (Cup/Handle).

Management:  ATNF management team is as good as any Large Cap: 2 of the co-founders discovered Anti-TNF Biologics & successfully completed trials phases & approval for the 1st approved Drug in the class- Remicade, which JNJ bought for over $5B. (This class is now the top-selling class of Drugs in the world... ie Remicade, Humira, Enbrel- these 3 alone sold $35B in the US in 2020).  Marc Feldmann won a Lasker award (only 2nd to Nobel) for the discovery.  Anti-TNF is 1 of their 3 platforms.  Another Co-Founder discovered the body's endocannabinoid system & will likely be a 2021 Nobel nominee for formulating synthetic CBD analogs (which is the 2nd of ATNF's platforms).  Additionally, the team collectively have sold Drugs or Companies to JNJ, Amgen, Biogen, and Bristol Myers.. each transaction was over $4B. Team also includes Prior President of Roche Bio, Chair of Clinical research prof at Standford & another with the same title at Oxford. (You can find full bios on 180LifeSciences.com). 

Initial drop: (why so undervalued currently) The company formed via the merger of 3 small biotech through a SPAC that went public 3 months ago. Due to a long clucky SPAC process, with horrible marketing (everyone thought this was a ""european pot stock"" bc the company being acquired was listed as CannaRX Bio- b/c that happen to be the 1 used for paperwork name. Combined this with an offering that included Rights & Warrants, and the multiple extensions- the price of Right & Warrant remained very low & on merge day, when Right converted- the Share Price dropped below $3.  This had nothing to do with the fundamental of the company- but rather an awful SPAC process (the SPAC manager is no longer associated with the company and sold most of her shares past several months (prob to avoid a lawsuit).",SCModerate,5,/r/pennystocks/comments/llp8ms/daily_plays_february_17_2021/gnr6ef5/,0.038,0.914,0.047,0.4684

Moreover, the recent power outages in Texas has really underscored the fragility of the power grid in the US, and while others have suggested that the government would want to rely on domestic sources of uranium as we pivot away from fossil fuels, production in the US has fallen off a cliff in recent years.  Canada is like the Saudi Arabia of Uranium.

My comments: Just because a stock has gone up a lot doesn't mean it can't go up any further. Based on the DD, they are growing revenue quickly which justifies their valuation. I personally think RIOT and Marathon Parent Group are overvalued and could pull back given their valuation. There is a premium for bitcoin related stocks, and this company is literally 1/3 the size in market cap and 1/10 the multiple that $RIOT has (which is cheaper than $MARA).

I ran into this subreddit about a month ago, after having done some decent pennystock trades on my own, thinking I might find some good stocks here. And I think I did, specifically: Aerpio, Atossa, Biolase, Castor, Tonix, Zomedica. However, many of these were going down after I bought them, and while many of you said to wait it out, I decided to cut my losses and managed to net ~0 in the end. Many of these have since doubled in value, so I guess I've realised I don't have the nerves to pull this off, but cudos to you guys who found these stocks and did the DD.

684,MICT," Before you buy this stock.......here's what you should know:

MICT operates through two subsidiaries -  Global Fintech Holdings Intermediate Ltd (essentially a trading platform) and Micronet Ltd (in-vehicle mobile applications).

Combined operating results for MICT as below....

(i) Operating loss -$7.4 mil 

(ii) Revenues $349k 

(iii) Marketing expense -$69k

(iv) G&A expense -$4 mil to pay on consultant fees, director salaries. 

(v) R&D expense $230k

There was one line from the partnership PR that made me wary,  *“Our key strategic alliance with the Exchange drives* ***high-margin revenue growth potential for MICT through both per contract commissions*** *and the lucrative margin financing associated with leveraged futures and commodity products trading, among other related service fees. The fact that our* ***clients are comprised of government and government-backed entities, among others, provides an element of low financial default risk****, supported in part from the strong financial relationships Xinhau brings to the venture. ""* 

A lack of retail traders due to expensive commissions means low liquidity on the exchange, and we all know that brokers profit from high volume transactions so this is a red flag to me. 

**TLDR: Company running two loss-making businesses with questionable long term value, spends more cash on paying its directors salaries than on R&D efforts.**

720,MC," can be for various reasons- the company isn't profitable, no credibility, OTC listed, no updates for years, etc. market cap and share price are intertwined, but it seems people mostly pay attention to share price. everything is relative.

Let's say company A has 1 million outstanding shares valued at $1/price per share, and company B has 1 billion outstanding shares & .001/pps. Their MC is the same-- $1 million. to me, it is muuch more reasonable for the $1/pps company to reach $2, because the market cap would only become 2 million. that's a lot of room to run. If the company with 1 Billion o/s even reached a penny, which probably everyone at first glance would agree that's a ""cheap"" price for a stock, the mkt cap would 10x, becoming 10 million. If the share price for company B reached a dollar, that's a Billion dollar MC. Company A's pps would be $1000 if its MC were 1Billion. 

See what I'm getting at? Just because a stock is worth a penny and you could buy a shit ton for cheap, it doesn't mean it has room to run. The distance from .01 to $1 is the same as $1 to $100. You could buy all the cheap stocks you want, with the mentality of ""hey, reaching a nickel from a penny is way easier than a dollar to $1.50! that's 45 more pennies it has to move!"" but meanwhile the market cap will 5x from one penny to five, where as it would 1.5x from $1 to $1.50.",simonpeggsnostril,3,/r/pennystocks/comments/llyn7y/market_cap_importance/gnsb6x6/,0.03,0.785,0.185,0.9899
721,CAN," I think the point is that the market cap CAN be unrealistically high, but it's a warning sign. That's generally reserved for meme stocks or stocks in a hype bubble, and it's unlikely to be sustainable.

Nope. This is just what faith tells you. Because you believe the explanation given to you by the establishment.

There is no fundementals reason for TSLA to be valued at what it's worth and this hasn't been corrected in 4 years. So is it really about market cap and profitability? Or is it just a popularity/hype contest for companies.

738,CEO," Decent DD but there is alot of information that could lead towards a bearish sentiment, and I hope you can address that. 

Firstly, some elements of companies financials may be a red flag. There was an almost 90% decrease in total assets from 2018 to 2019 which went unexplained. Debt is actually at 500k not 42k (total liabilities line item 2020 - WSJ). Granted, there was a decrease in debt as well which makes up for the drastic decrease in assets. For the periods 2019 and 2020 their is an acute lack of financial information which makes fair valuing this company difficult. 

Secondly, you mentioned live venues in Dubai.  How does the company plan to launch a live entertainment venue when that city is still under a partial lockdown? And even if the deal is for online concerts, the app is only in Chinese which will hinder market acceptance in a predominantly Arabic and English speaking country. There only roughly 150000 Chinese in Dubai, about 1.5% of the overall population. 

There are also a lot of assumptions not based on data. You assume they're going to make more acquistions because they just made one back in June, to generate more capital. However, no details about the deal with Hunter and Multiple Events (In Dubai) have been released. What are the terms of this deal and what kind of returns can the company expect? Also, Is there any data to support that their online concerts have been more popular? 

The website landing page is decent but it's unfinished. For example, I went to register for guitar lessons with Larry, but under the ""what this course offers"" section all I saw was the placeholder text ""Lorem ipsum..."" So obviously it still needs work and I highly doubt anyone is purchasing that $200 guitar lesson at this time.

The PT of 120 by one obscure analyst is another red flag. Even you agree this is insanely optimistic. IMO $1.6 definately makes more sense in the immidiate short term if enough hype can be generated. 

Some good points to note which were left out: CSCW got Ashanti and Larry Carlton to perform on the platform not to long ago, which, according to their CEO, generated sales of over $2M (""proper profits"" as you stated). The company also opened an office on Mazaya Business Avenue in Dubai so it appears they are still intent on moving forward with penetrating Dubai.

If you want the long strong in the sector you may want to look at those that mine as well as recover batteries for resource. Since disposal of EV batteries and going all electric is going to become a very big deal. Those companies which can be economically viable to both mine and recover materials for the production stream will live longer term. Given the current environment to charge ahead we do not want the same problem as the disposal of tech and electronic wastes. Disposal of these batteries versus recovery is very much like spent nuclear fuel something to consider before we get there.

The current supply is barely enough to cover Tesla's needs but with all of the other major car companies and EV start-ups also needing supply, there is going to be a huge push to get production into all known deposits which also means lots of mergers and acquisitions in the future. You can take the risky explorers or the secure producers depending on your risk tolerance but unless batteries change in the next couple of years anyone in this sector is going to do very well.  (Takes any significant change up to 5 years to get new tech developed and into production so nothing is changing in the short term.)

I don't think this company is reputable or capable of delivering in a meaningful way (i.e. not snakeoil). I can't invest in a company when I have no faith in their management. Their history demonstrates that they just chase trends and fail to deliver. It is a theme. Sure, they might get lucky on something and this could be it, but never underestimate the ability of incompetence to fuck up a good thing.

Edit: How are the milestones with weed, pressland, hydroxy? I am sure management is competent in all those things and making an ETH competitor as well. /s

777,DD," What are you on buddy? I have a life. It doesn’t revolve around sitting on reddit all day and responding to everyone and anyone who comments on my posts.

To answer your statement though. Arcology has been their main project for years now, and it is finally coming to fruition this year. Their release of the developer kit shows real transparency and allows for the product to speak for itself. They also been building up all their operations to complement this primary project of there’s which demonstrates that they are committed to this project. Your other points about them being a chaser makes no sense either as they are a venture capitalist firm. Their job is to find profit where profit lies. This company is specifically focused on investing in emerging industries which has a high risk as their plays can take years to pan out. That being said all the industries they are invested in are ones that should pan out in quite bullish fashion.

They are trying to provide a solution to the market that will make the experience better for all, manufacturers, resellers and consumers. lots of issues with Amazon and eBay when buying auto-parts. Their goal is to fix those issues. 

Sellers don't care where they make the sale as long as they make lots of them and at good margins. $FLES has spent literally nothing on marketing the past several years and they are generating $10M in revs. All through SEO! Once the marketing campaign starts for the new platform, this can go gangbusters. 

What do you think people thought about $ETSY when they first said they were going to be the Amazon of crafts and vintage boutique items? What about $FTCH basically being the Amazon of fashion. Both are niche marketplaces with multi-billion dollar valuations.

796,LKQ," LKQ is awesome, they focus on different products though. From their website:

""LKQ was initially formed in 1998 through the combination of a number of wholesale recycled products businesses located in Florida, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin. We subsequently expanded globally through internal development and approximately 270 acquisitions of aftermarket, recycled, refurbished, and remanufactured product suppliers and manufacturers, self-service retail businesses, and specialty vehicle aftermarket equipment and accessories suppliers.""

They do refurbished, recycled and remanufactured. $FLES will be focusing on new product direct from the manufacturer, distributors and resellers.

I could see an interesting partnership/relationship between the companies down the road.

So $FLES can be the Amazon of new , aftermarket OEM and high performance. and LKQ can be the amazon of recycled, remanufactured and refurbished. 

Looking LKQ's website though they aren't trying to be an Amazon, they are the seller period. 

$FLES is creating a marketplace that anyone can sell on. Including LKQ.

Seeing LKQ's $11B Market Cap just shows how early $FLES is in it's process. People are always looking for more and better places to sell their merchandise. No one has brand loyalty to sell solely on eBay or solely on Amazon. It just means more sells to an audience that came to the site specifically for auto parts.

Early stage this will be the biggest benefit to small custom manufacturers that have tight margins and want to get more eyeballs on their product.

There is so much potential here.

The offering price started at $2 and there is wording in there that states they can increase the offering amount at any time. I suspect we will see an amendment to the 1-A within a month or so increasing that offering price.

The higher the offering price the less shares get added as they are capped at $15M. But even if they never raise it and they fully dilute to \~8.6M shares, what is the Share price if they bring in $30M in 2021, $100M  in 2022, $300M + in 2023.

The OP has done a good job collating all the info into 1 single location - and they think it's an undervalued company.

Remember, this is the OTC - very few (if any) companies actually have any business models - let alone revenues, and profits.

One of the things I suggest readers do is to go to OTC markets and look into the more recent quarterly results which can show you the direction the company is headed.

For me, it appears to be a company that has more steak -and less sizzle - which is very rare in the OTC. Here you have a company focusing on making money - and not tweeting useless updates for appearance sake.

Also, make sure you look past their main website - since that is not where they sell anything....and look into the DD docs which shows their actual ECommerce sites.

869,CSU," Brewbilt has been ""buying"" back stocks since last year and plan to keep doing it in 2021. I see one time where they bought back 70 million shares for about $140k last November. A far cry from the ""up to $5 million"" they plan to buy back this year. 70 million shares is a drop in the bucket when talking about a few billion shares.

I do see that the company authorized 10 billion more shares, and yes that is a B, to its already 10 billion shares authorized. Mixed signals much?

The company's sales and expansion are questionable. Read this article about a ""sale"" to CSU Sacramento. The university never ordered any brewing equipment from the company.
 https://www.google.com/amp/s/equity.guru/2020/07/16/brewbilt-bbrw-otc-penny-pump-says-selling-brew-equipment-supposed-buyer-says-wut/amp/

There is a connection with Jeffrey Lewis and SIML from about a year and a half ago. Possibly some ""sales"" of equipment to the other company. Do your own research.

Full disclosure, I have sold all my $SIML shares after doing this research. I never have owned $BBRW stock. And I never plan on buying these two stocks. Just giving a warning.

If that's true, and options expire every 3rd Friday of the month, this could go up, turbo parabolic.

I'm looking at the Level II BID/ASK right now that the BID (buy) volume is steady in the hundreds of thousands and millions. Very nice.

If you YOLO, take some gains but don’t sit on them.

But you don’t want that. You want to be growing daily, not waiting for the new accumulation period to send your stock to the moon. If it’s OTC, chances are that’s not gonna happen anytime soon.

Study charts. Investopedia.com is your friend and mentor. Figure out whether the stock is on an uptrend or downtrend (important for swings).

I set a similar challenge for myself, but it’s $100 to $1000 😂
