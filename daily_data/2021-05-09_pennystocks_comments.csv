0,TDA," It is an OTC pennystock, which is why you're having trouble.

I believe it is available on all of the more legit brokerages in the US.  I have some on my TDA but I believe you'd be able to get it on Fidelity and Schwab, etc.

25,IMO," VSQTF / FANS.CN

I have 30,000 shares.

Your numbers are end of 2020. Since then, they started buying back their own stock. This company turned profitable in 2020, then bought into COVID rapid tests and I think that is their cash cow.

The 2020 auditor said something about the company needing cash and management said it wasn't a problem. That's because the auditor prepared the financial statements in 2021 and pretended it was 2020. So, IMO, ""not a problem"" means it's April 2021 already, the money has been raised and we're investing it.

IMO, this company was shorted in February and their re-purchase program caused some problems for the seller. They probably hit their limit of 2% for the month or 5% for the year so they can't protect the price but the investors are not putting stop losses on it because it's obviously worth more.

The next financial statement will show how much money came in from COVID tests in Q1 2021. Due soon!

It would be remiss to not mention [FANS.CN](https://FANS.CN) / FUNFF in the same post, which is in the portfolio of VST. It is also selling at a discount and I would expect [VST.CN](https://VST.CN) / VSQTF to increase their holdings on this. I'm more interested in [FANS.CN](https://FANS.CN) / FUNFF because [VST.CN](https://VST.CN) / VSQTF doesn't have a limit on how much they can buy of this.
