1,IR," There is another possible explanation (not defending the company- I know nothing about it). Losses can be written off or written down in a number of ways. Part of it could be listed as “inventory shrinkage” (something every company deals with), and part could be booked as bad debt (they know where it went, but were unable to collect on it). I ran a retail company in Silicon Valley for years, and we had a different problem- declining value of our inventory. Every time a new product came out, the ‘old ones’ on the shelf went down in price. Even though it wasn’t lost or stolen, and it wasn’t bad debt, we had to write the inventory down (or sell it at a loss, which impacted EBITDA). I’m not sure how it works with consumable products… if their retail price declines after they take inventory, they might still need to write it down further. 

The fact that the CEO doesn’t remember is concerning, but not necessarily surprising. Usually the CFO handles all those write downs, and updates the other C suite officers in a board meeting. If he’s in charge of IR and is giving inconsistent answers, that’s a different problem. It may not be fraud… but may be sloppy management and poor internal controls. Still concerning, but in a different way.",DotComBomb1999,11,/r/stocks/comments/o0svx7/did_i_discover_a_fraud_taking_place/h1x8crx/,0.157,0.805,0.037,-0.9836

10,DD," I am an accountant. I have worked in audit. The following is some basic info for you that is not intended to be precise, but should provide some insight into auditing and accounting. 

There are a few different factors when it comes to auditing and accounting, including the size of the firm performing the audit and the expertise of the staff and partner on the audit. There is also the concept of materiality...this is a calculation performed by the auditors which results in a dollar value. The dollar value is supposed to represent the value of a mistake in the financial statements/accounting records that would result in an investor changing their minds about their investment. If the auditors find an error below that dollar amount, it is considered to be immaterial and is not examined as closely. A ""clearly trivial"" threshold is also calculated, below which errors are ignored. In some companies, materiality can be as low as $10k. I worked on an audit for a large company where the clearly trivial threshold was over $1 million.

When it comes to inventory, auditors will apply several common practices including inventory counts (usually simultaneously in all locations so that companies can't pull the common scam of moving inventory from warehouse to warehouse). Inventory counts are not infallible, even if you open many boxes on shelves and perform random spot tests, it's always possible that errors exist and things get missed. In addition, auditors are supposed to check for impairment on inventory by looking at the purchase price and carrying price to ensure it is valued appropriately. This is where expertise comes in and where mistakes are often made. Auditors are accountants who work across a broad range of industries and may not have enough expertise in any of those fields to really know what the appropriate market value is and they may not have the time or resources to do a deep dive to find out. They do their best, but often rely on management justification of value.

People see ""audited"" on the financials and think it means a lot more than it does. Yes, it is a lot of work and a lot of facets of the company are examined and tested. Yes, it provides much more assurance that the financials are correct than a review or a compilation or no check by auditors, but it's not infallible. Audits rely heavily on management to provide the necessary information and to disclose all relevant information such as all bank accounts, investments, warehouse locations, etc. There are tests to confirm many of these items, but assurance with audits is not 100%.

It's really important to do your DD when investing in a company and to take what the CEO says with a grain of salt...it's their job to assure you that everything is ok and to get you to invest and stay invested. They are really good salespeople. I'm very sorry to hear that you have had bad luck with this investment and I hope it turns around for you, but I appreciate you sharing so that others can also learn more about investing and DD.",theanamazonian,2,/r/stocks/comments/o0svx7/did_i_discover_a_fraud_taking_place/h2006f8/,0.07,0.797,0.132,0.9909

Long term bonds, like the 20 year.  It doubles in price during a crash and stays relatively flat (but volatile) during a bull market.

The problem with puts, even LEAPs is most crashes take 1.5 to 2 years, and most LEAPs do 1 to 1.5 years, so you you'd have to time the top perfectly to the day, and choose one of the few 2 year options, and time the bottom perfectly when you buy the LEAP.  Then when you do get it, it's barely going to be leveraged, basically like shorting stock itself at that point.  But say you did it perfectly and timed it right, what would you most likely get?

The reason is that the market is discounting that we won't return to 100% of normality any time soon.

And it doesn't take a genius to understand why. There are still significant risks with a commercial RE business at the moment. Just to mention a couple of obvious ones: first, it is not clear whether all workers will get back to the office or not, or to a reduced rate (which would still have a huge impact on office occupancy rates and rental prices for said offices). Also, the pandemic has accelerated the eCommerce trend. Will people go back to Malls and shops or will they stick to buying online? Amazon is set to overtake WalMart in revenue in 2022... most REITs deal with commercial properties such as offices and malls. And I am not even taking into account that we could go into a third wave in fall because of new variants and lower vaccines' efficacy.

Could I be wrong and could REITs still be significant under valued? 100% yes. But it doesn't make any sense to say REITs are a great investment just because they are not back at their all time highs (even in a market where almost everything is at or close to historical highs). REITs have managed fairly well throughout the pandemic so far, but if we witness a system shift in how commercial properties are rented and used long term, it is not easy for most REITs to adapt to the new norm. Those nice 6+% yields could be at risk as well.",SegheCoiPiedi1777,2,/r/stocks/comments/o0p2nr/everyone_slept_on_reits_last_year_sret_etf_still/h1y0ulp/,0.047,0.859,0.094,0.9254

206,BBIG," Accidentally stumbled into a covered strangle. 

Accidentally stumbled into a covered strangle.

So Yesterday $BBIG plummeted 10%. I decided to sell to puts at 2 at strike 4 with the underlying at 4.07 not caring if I got assigned because the premiums were nice and the Breakeven was at 3.30.

These 2 puts are ""secured"" via margin.

Fast forward to this morning, put premiums still nice. Sell 2 more puts basically at the money for the same premium. Nice.

Then BBIG decides to moon so I say hell, I'll sell 3 CC's on 300 of my shares at strike 5.5

Now I realize I'm in a covered strangle and I keep reading about unlimited downside potential. I'm looking at the risk profile analysis on TOS and it seems like my max loss is 2000 for the 400 shares I have plus 1000 from the covered strangle.

Ideally we shoot up to 5.5, I sell my shares, and then my put is way OTM so I'm good on that end.

Or, i get assigned to buy 400 shares at 3.20, and let my call ride to expiration or hopefully still get assigned on those.

This is a pure IV play and I'm failing to see where the danger comes from for this covered strangle. The share price is cheap, and I'm trying to dump these eventually.

223,HUGE," Can someone here tell me how to deal with the gut wrenching feeling of seeing HUGE missed profits?  New investor here, I invested a lot of money in a stock in February and it dropped 75% in value, I held strong and bought the dips and rode some waves up to May where I actually recovered my initial investment even though I was still holding on to all the shares I bought at the high price.  It was down 50% for months, but then it jumped like crazy and I locked in 15% profit about a week ago.  I told myself that this was my target from the outset and what I was expecting to get in 4 months.    I immediately took that money and reinvested it in some other plays that I really believe in.   But then I check the stock today and I would've been sitting on over 120% profit if I had held on just 4 days longer...   


I know hindsight is 20/20, and I should be happy that I locked in profits, but I feel so defeated and almost sick to my stomach because I could've really used that money.  I don't have high income and I'm trying to invest in my future.  I've proven to myself that stocks dropping in value doesn't really affect me and I don't panic sell, but I'm utterly destroyed at these missed profits.",EepeesJ1,1,/r/stocks/comments/o10vqy/rstocks_daily_discussion_wednesday_jun_16_2021/h1zed3y/,0.086,0.741,0.173,0.957

>With competitors like FanDuel, Barstool Sportsbook, Bet365, PointsBet, William Hill, FoxBet and offerings from major established U.S. casino players like BetMGM all snapping up market share, the question then becomes: what differentiates DraftKings? 

I have yet to see a good answer for that question.  There is no brand loyalty when it comes to betting.

I agree that it's definitely priced in for them, but I'm confident they are going to continue to find ways to expand their options for people. They currently do bonuses for different parlay bets and use boosts that expire which can be applied to help your odds or move a line. Those are features that, while not unique, allow them to compete by offering the better boosts than other brands. 

At the end of the day their brand visibility is huge compared to competitors, esports are getting larger and larger and will add an entirely new demographic to the equation as it grows, and the industry is still very young.

MSFT is an integral piece of the puzzle for organizations around the globe and they are looking to continue their growth through some new ideas and improvements. I could see Teams taking over the digital meeting space once efficiencies with Outlook and the rest of the Office platform are realized. With Office, they are virtually uncontested in a large revenue market. Same goes for Windows other than Apple, but in professional settings they remain dominant. They haven't even been that successful with mobile devices and they still print. Intelligent Cloud is a revenue monster. Their work in video games as a service makes sense considering where things are going. They are a player in pc gaming.

If I were in your position I would probably lean toward VT or VOO but MSFT is, in my opinion, the lowest risk play for a single stock all things considered.

305,IMO," **TL;DR Follow your strategy or HODL. (not financial advice)**  
  
No one knows if we're in a bubble or not, as shown by the comments here and on many subreddits. Trying to predict the market is nearly impossible, and trying to time that prediction even more so. It takes time to see returns and we all want to see a 100% return in a year like if we had bought in March of 2020. But that isn't going to happen.  
  
So what to do about it knowing you're very unlikely to predict or time it correctly? Stick with your strategy or adjust your strategy and stick with it.  
  
Think the bubble is going to pop and the market drops 30-60%? Sell it all and wait for that drop.  
  
Think inflation is going to make everything drop 30-60%? Sell it all and buy inflation hedges like gold, commodities, and that banned ""other currency"", etc. DYOR on inflation hedges because I really am just guessing from what I've read.  
  
Think inflation is a threat but probably wont drop the market 30-60%? Continue investing and keep \~20% in cash to buy dips.  
  
My strategy right now is to build my savings back up and occasionally buy dips. I had a nice savings but invested a lot of it recently so I'm rebuilding that rainy day fund and letting my current investments ride. I want to replace my roof as well so saving for that. And I'll likely buy more S&P ETF stock and ""other currency"" once I'm back where I want to be savings wise. But this is a long term outlook, \~5-10 years. Look at yearly charts. Sure there's drops if you look at it weekly, but yearly candles are almost always green other than huge crises (2008).  
  
Worst case, with inflation, stocks trade \~flat for a few years IMO. From my research, stocks certainly don't perform as well during high inflation, but they don't drop 30-60% like a bubble or crisis. And once inflation settles down there's more money available to start going back into stocks. Long term it all levels out so just stick with a strategy and don't worry about it.",Zrocker04,6,/r/stocks/comments/o18dmp/are_we_in_a_stock_market_bubble_or_are_these/h1zt9g4/,0.085,0.818,0.097,0.2427

 That can make you money. But there are more scammers the non-scammers. Just be careful, and don’t bet your rent or your grocery money. Because it’s like Las Vegas, you can play till you lose play or to win.  most people play till they win and then they stay in and lose it all.  
Personally one of the best stocks right now for me has been AMC, but I got in a long time ago when I was cheap. I believe in the company so that’s why I did it and I don’t care if I lose it all I’m not selling. There are other companies that are potentially good and a lot cheaper but I can’t give advice on that. I’m terrible at picking stocks.  Except when it comes to AMC I’ve done pretty good on that so far but if it takes a dive I’m riding it all the way down.  Which means I won’t make a dime on that.

Don't put too much pressure on yourself to learn too much at your first step. Use that $50 to get your feet wet and do an easy solid move.

Like others said, picking an SP500-like ETF is the perfect first purchase. Buy with confidence one of the main recommended ones, and then spend time learning about what your money is busy doing.

Another very easy thing to do with your first $50 is to get into Betterment .com. It's basically like an SP500-like EFT, and it's super easy to start and set and forget. You can also do a periodic auto withdrawal. So for instance, say you can afford $10 per week, so set it to automatically take that $10 each week from your bank account and put it into your investment account. Now you are building your investing long term and it all took only a few easy steps.

You don't have to stop there. Do that first step so you are in the game, and then take as long as you want learning more.",Banner80,2,/r/stocks/comments/o0sy3f/and_stocks_i_can_get_into_for_50_dollars/h1xm900/,0.02,0.79,0.19,0.9851

335,IMO," That's a sensible analysis. Yeah, the more I look at inflation, the more it seems that it will actually be transitory, but something is bugging me. Why is the Fed so hellbent on calming everyone down? What is their play? Why are they continuing to buy bonds? What the hell is going on with the overnight reverse repo? The government is handling this very suspiciously (in my opinion) and given the increased spending and the zero interest rates (0.06% effective Fed funds rate right now, what the hell!), inflation could go rampant.

We have seen some commodities slowing down and correcting, which should hopefully reduce inflation, but it's just suspicious. I don't know. I do have most of my money in S&P500 + some tech companies + renewables, but I've got gold, gold miners and copper miners as well although they are 15% of my portfolio. I'm not all in on the inflation trade myself, because that would be stupid IMO, but I do avoid some of the growth stocks and prefer to focus on value right now.

As always, time will tell. I could be very much wrong about this, but that's the risk in the stock market, right 😁",y_angelov,1,/r/stocks/comments/o11e5p/more_news_about_inflation_recordhigh_ppi/h1zcj9o/,0.119,0.739,0.141,0.4837

341,TTWO," I was also looking at TTWO for more or less the same reasons. 

The thing with them is they make money in bursts. So every 3-6 odd years they'll crush everything. Looking at the chart the price seems to reflect that. So I just hope you are ready to sell almost immediately after GTA6 or whatever they end up doing comes out.

Just my quick opinion.",JustNotFatal,2,/r/stocks/comments/o1c7j3/hot_take_on_take_two_interactive_ttwo_thoughts/h204apw/,0.06,0.859,0.081,0.3642
342,TTWO," I think there is great potential in the stock moving forward. GTA V has been around for over 8 years and is still selling an impressive amount of units. They have not only been able to create one of the biggest video games of all time but have also been able to monetize it for a very long time. I see a great value in the fact that they have Online versions of GTA V and RDR2 which allows them to keep players engaged after finishing the singleplayer story.

GTA 6 is still probably some years off, though an announcement would be likely within 1,5 years which I expect will help the stock move. In the short term, TTWO has stated that they will be releasing multiple remasters of old games, and there are certain indications this could include GTA III and RDR1 which I would expect to sell really well.

Apart from Rockstar the earnings from 2K and others look solid. Rockstar is what I mainly own the stock for but I believe the other companies provide much-needed cashflow during the long development times of Rockstar releases.

352,COO," My favorites:

Exact Sciences - currently trading around $120, both Goldman Sachs and Raymond James recently initiated coverage with strong buy ratings and $160 price targets. On a conference call this morning, CFO and COO Jeff Elliott indicated that he is looking for very strong growth in the company's business this year coming out of the pandemic. The company anticipates investing 100 million dollars this year in developing its blood based multi cancer screening tests, with FDA approval expected in 2025. This company has an amazing management team and has become the global leader in cancer screening and diagnostics. ARK funds are heavily invested in this name. My top pick!

Mimedx - this Advanced wound care company with an amazing pipeline of therapeutic biologics to treat knee osteoarthritis and other musculoskeletal conditions has recovered from the verge of bankruptcy and is now stronger than ever. An entirely  reconstituted and very impressive board of directors has completely rebuilt the management team which is also very impressive in its depth and breadth of knowledge and experience. Key read outs from Phase IIb and Phase 3 clinical trials for the treatment of knee osteoarthritis and plantar fasciitis are due out later this summer. In addition, Mimedx will be added to the Russell 2000, Russell 3000 in Russell micro-cap indicas at the end of this month. This stock is currently trading around $11 with price targets ranging from $16 to $30. Prescience Point Capital is an activist investor in this name and a very comprehensive research report can be found on their website.

401,WBA," I work in this industry and am well familiar with Ulta. It's a wonderful brand and business, and they really are in position to dominate the market. Sephora is a completely different experience, and while more upscale, is not what the majority of revenue is  heading to in the space. Likewise, WBA and the drugstore options are a joke and a non factor.

Cosmetics is so much more than a utility these days, and something I think reddit's primarily male audience fails to fully grasp. It's an artistry and a lifestyle trend that millenials and Gen Z have taken to with increasing passion. It's not just a daily application, it's a manifestation of  personality and style. For reference, multiple of the top YouTube personalities are in the cosmetic business. Celebrities have started lines, and Instagram models peddle product.

All that said, it's a bit overpriced for me. An excellent opportunity professionally, if I were to change jobs, but an expensive investment. $18B valuation, on less than $2B book is hardly a deal. Revenue is strong, and should pick up this year, but I'd like it much more around $10B valuation. If, however, you're willing to go long, overpaying now may very well pay off, as they are easily on pace to take the lion's share of the entire industry.",JDinvestments,7,/r/stocks/comments/o0xnzi/the_case_for_ulta_a_smart_retail_reopening_play/h1xte5q/,0.023,0.846,0.131,0.9692

You kind of just sold me on this with this one sentence lmao. 

A couple months ago I asked my partner about what she thought of ThreadUp, a company I knew nothing about, was only vaguely aware of the name at all, and the only reason I asked was having seen it on the IPO calendar. 

She said that while she doesn't personally use it, it's HOT amongst Gen Z (she's a millenial but close to the Gen Z threshold) and that people who use it really love the service they provide.  I mentioned this to my bro friends, who ridiculed me for contemplating to buy a used clothing reseller. My GF insisted that despite the fact Ross consignment stores exist (my bros' counterargument) that this was a good company, which was enough for me to pull the trigger.

411,SP," i swing trade my long positions, first.  Cause, i tend to know the most about these stocks.  I have at most 10 different companies spread across different sectors.  I will swing up to 3 companies.  This is due to my liquidity i like to maintain, and when i swing i like to make a big bet.  If i miss, I will hold the stock cause this was my long position and i wanted to add more anyways.  Sell later and average down, take some profits, refill the cash reserves. 

&#x200B;

If i get bored, i will seek out some new company.  New tech, Bio-tech, recent IPO anything with volatility.  I will watch that company or sector for a month or two, maybe put a 2% of full position on it so i really pay attention.  When i feel the company is actually solid, or the market perceives it as such:  I will begin buying or adding on dips and selling the spikes.  I stay away reddit or stocktwits once I am on the stock, don't want to be emotional.  

&#x200B;

Set clear goals.  I don't put more than 10% of my nut.  and i will spread that out among many stocks but will reduce my profit percentage goal if i feel ""weeded"" with keeping track of the tickers.  I like 15% profits for swings, but will take a 5%.  Compounding!!

417,GME," This post is terrible: https://old.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/o0scoy/the_bigger_short_how_2008_is_repeating_at_a_much/

Can't really state this opinion on their subreddit because I'd get banned.

The ""Due Dilligence"" done is just an extrapolation of the movie Inside Job into fantasy-land of ""reddit vs rich people"". That's as far as the dilligence goes.

The post feeds into the Reddit echo chamber of anti-capitalism that is brought up in tons and tons of threads on the site (regardless of initial topic) for the past year(s). It encourages all the people who read it to dump money buying GME stock ASAP. ""Buy GME to fight the rich! Buy GME to combat income inequality! Buy GME to eat the rich!""

It's delusional. The GME spike was a big media event, everyone in finance (and out) knows about it. The financial system is not a single entity, it's lots of competing companies looking to fuck over each others and yeah, fuck the consumers. Many of them are looking to profit off of individuals buying or selling GME stocks right now.

All this post does is incite people to gamble away their rainy-day funds and make it seem ok.

418,NLY," Looking for some advice on dividend versus index fund as I'm having a bit of a internal debate. 

I am putting 500 to 600 into the stock market every month and I'm 27. 

For the last year a SIGNIFICANT portion of that was being thrown into a dividend portfolio (SCHD, NLY, VYM, PSEC). It sounded like a reasonable idea since compounding dividends would eventually become passive income. However, there is the matter of the share price dropping by the payout and the taxes on it even when you do reinvest. Which are arguments for why you should find a solid index fund (VUG, QQQ) and just invest into that, experience strong growth (compared to a dividend at least), then cash out.

I have nothing against those companies, they are actually safer, but as an individual stock picker, I'm convicted on these names. Lam and AMD are my main plays.

Many of these claims seem to be based on reporting by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. Apple claims (and disputes) many inaccuracies in these reports.  Here are some of their rebuttals and clarifications (from an article written in 2017), point for point:

1)  Apple does not and has not ""manipulated its tax residency"" to Ireland.  They actually opened a facility in that country way back in 1980, when Steve Jobs wanted to begin expanding their business overseas.  When first opened, that facility employed 60 people; there are now more than 6,000 workers there.

2)  When Ireland changed its tax laws in 2015, Apple complied by changing the residency of their Irish subsidiaries, and they informed Ireland, the European Commission and the United States. The changes made did not reduce their tax payments in \*any\* country. In fact, their payments to Ireland increased significantly; from 2014 through 2017, Apple Inc has paid $1.5 billion in tax there — 7 percent of all corporate income taxes paid in that country during that time.

3)  When a customer buys an Apple product outside the United States, the profit is first taxed in the country where the sale takes place. Then Apple pays taxes to Ireland, where Apple sales and distribution activity is executed by some of the 6,000 employees working there. Additional tax is then also due in the US when the earnings are repatriated. Apple’s worldwide effective tax rate is 24.6 percent, higher than average for US multinationals. 

Since every country involved is getting a piece of the pie, I don't see how they can all be crying about ""reduced tax take"" from these transactions.

4) Currrent taxes are not assessed based on where the company resides, but rather where the value is created. Under the current international tax system, profits are taxed based on where the value is created. The taxes Apple pays to countries around the world are based on that principle. The vast majority of the value in their products is indisputably created in the United States — where they do their design, development, engineering work and much more — so the majority of their taxes are owed to the US.

5) From their own web site: ""We understand that some would like to change the tax system so multinationals’ taxes are spread differently across the countries where they operate, and we know that reasonable people can have different views about how this should work in the future. At Apple we follow the laws, and if the system changes we will comply. We strongly support efforts from the global community toward comprehensive international tax reform and a far simpler system, and we will continue to advocate for that.”

Full disclosure: I have no position in AAPL (or any other company mentioned by the OP). I just thought some of the OP's claims sounded one-sided, so I went digging for the other side of the argument. I feel it is always wise to hear both sides of any debate, especially before changing laws and/or enacting new ones.",TurboMinivan,2,/r/stocks/comments/o0qbhz/digital_tax_impact_for_for_big_tech/h1x1uky/,0.024,0.874,0.101,0.993
463,VIAC," This is essentially what Bill Hwang did, minus the shorting. Which has since struck me as funny that people think VIAC is undervalued. One guy bought up virtually the entire float, and artificially drove the price up. Because his position was growing, he could take out more margin, drive it up even higher, rinse and repeat. He never got to the point of shorting, but I have no doubt he'd have opened that position had he managed to continue.",JDinvestments,3,/r/stocks/comments/o1aahl/hypothetical_speaking/h1zq2mq/,0.09,0.871,0.039,-0.6428

468,GDP," They will surpass the US in GDP very soon. They're tech is on par with the US, just not widely adopted in the western world. China has made it apparent they have strong interest in Africa, and hold influence in most of the Asian countries. China alone has significant purchasing power that outdoes the west. If they take India and Africa, they will easily surpass the US in value. You talk as if the USD will retain significant influence over the next decade. I think it's clear that it is losing influence. The US already lags significantly in global exports, and relies on the dollar as their only trade commodity. If it loses value at the rate it's already doing, none of what you've said will matter.",JDinvestments,1,/r/stocks/comments/o0rx3m/prove_to_me_your_best_etfs_mutual_funds_index/h1wzas6/,0.066,0.789,0.145,0.8555

2) your DD is way too focused on the countries. You can’t buy stock in China, you buy stocks of companies located in China. GDP of the United States means so little to me when my largest holding ($APPL) does significantly more business outside of the US.
