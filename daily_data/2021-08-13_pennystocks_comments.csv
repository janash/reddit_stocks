Oh and they signed an LOI a few days ago that they payed for with 1 million shares priced at $1 per share 🙄🙄🙄. Current SP is 40 cents.

DTGI - Filed an S1 to uplist to the Nasdaq. Massive moves coming from this company in the next 6 months. Leadership is dynamite, they have done this with 3 other companies and created over $2 billion in market value along the way. Just like VSQTF this is one of the best value plays on the OTC.

$SWEL announced yesterday 8.2mio CAD in revenue for the first half of 2021. This is an increase by 562% in relation Ton the 1dt half of 2020. The first time in history the company gained profit.

They are not only a CBD play (bought StillCanna). They also have 57 covid testing stations in UK. Nearly 125k CAD per day in revenue.

That's why even though a couple handfuls of traditional analysis institutions have evaluated the current fair-value for [Redacted Video Game Retailer] is about $320, the stock coils between $150 and $170 before temporarily launching up to the 300's for a couple days, then falling back down despite there being no selling pressure.
