Some high income folks actually set up charitable trusts / foundations for this purpose. 

It’s also why donating appreciated stock to charity can carry huge tax advantages. You get to deduct the full value of the shares, including your basis and any short or long term capital gains.

…and I believe you can combine both strategies, not that I’ve got the $$$ (or gains) to make it worthwhile.

115,GM," Yup, Tesla made it all possible, but the first-to-market usually winds up with only around 40% of the mature market. This is still a *massive* opportunity for Tesla, but the stock was priced as though Tesla would *own* the market, like Amazon dominates the cloud-services market.

The first-to-market firm has to spend money to educate consumers and hammer out serious technical issues. Competitors can skip some of these costs.

&#x200B;

>Fifty years ago, General Electric published research that demonstrated in almost every market over the long term, the market leader ends up with a 40% market share, the number two player garners a 20% share, number three earns 10% and the rest of the market shares the remaining 30%. These numbers hold to this day, except for network effects businesses like online marketplaces where market leaders command more than a 90% share.

Note: Tesla may sell software, batteries and other components to some of their competitors (especially early on), so their share might end up being a bit higher than 40%.

Like all these calls to stop short selling what do you think that would do what do you think happens if it's only retail investors in the market things just meaningly go up until a collapse? 

Think about it like this You're willing to give up money for what, your principles? That's Looney tunes there was a time not too long ago where WSB was all about Wall Street. We made Martin Shkreli an honorary mod for God's sakes.

GME is cool I'll admit that. But the mission isn't going to be derailed just cuz you take a little bit of profit. Looking at GME any less than one year time frame you should stay out of it.

But I'm sure the frenzy of buy and hold that this place has created most people aren't doing that.

419,UWMC," I work as part of a mortgage brokerage.

I think that one thing you could consider is that yes Quicken(RocketProTPO) and Fairway do have some issues with how they can take clients from the broker. But usually this is not something that really harms a mortgage broker since your client tends to deal with you directly as well. They would at least remember if you did a good job getting their loan done. 

If you ever did refinancing or bought a home, you would probably have wanted to check several lenders regarding No Point No Fee or At Par rate. That's why you would ask a mortgage broker to check for you. You also want to QUALIFY for a loan.

I won't deny that UWM can have excellent service and pricing, but sometimes another lender can have better pricing. No loan is ever considered the same with any lender. Some lenders are more flexible than others with how they consider client's income and documentation. UWM can have some strange documentation requirements when it comes to self-employed borrowers.

But what UWM did here, aka make the exclusive activity agreement, was not fair to the brokers or partners they had. 

UWM's declaration goes against mortgage broker's main purpose, stating you can't work with people we choose to fight with on pricing, or else 1. Your company eats a $50,000 fine, and 2. We kick you out of the agreement and all new loans submitted hereon are thrown out. Shouldn't they just kick out partners? Where on earth does a fine need to come in like that?
 
The other thing is...how would they even know? I don't think that can be done without getting invasive on some information.

**The issue is that once this becomes a precedent, UWM can force out other lenders with pricing similar if not better to theirs if more brokers are fine with this. I do not really buy into them dealing with just Quicken and Fairway far into the future**

LoanDepot does not compete with either UWM or Quicken in terms of service and possibly pricing so far as I've seen and experienced, so why would UWM mind them?

I also am not sure how closing costs would drastically differ between Quicken and UWM. Both charge similar underwriting fees. Escrow fees are fixed by the government and county to a certain amount of variance.

Usually the main problem is how much credit or charge you get at a certain rate. Appraisals and credit reports can vary, but usually aren't more than $1,000 depending on some factors.

**I do think UWMC is a good stock to get**, but I wanted to clarify the information on how the exclusive partnership appears from a broker's POV.",artemis4055,4,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/neg3ey/uwmc_the_long_view/gyh946i/,0.055,0.811,0.134,0.9895

Inflation in energy is only going to help the Biden adgenda, making renewables and more efficient infrastructure more appealing with standard market mechanics. 

I was over positioned in prospective tech and need to diversify. If there is a squeeze, great, already sold a call to lower my cost basis and cap my gain.

726,CMS," What a load of FUD.. Clover went from having less than 60k members to 130,000 (66k of those are Medicare advantage members) in just 1 quarter and their  guidance is to end the year with 200k. All of this in the span of one month, simply by getting CMS direct contracting with the federal govt this past month. 

The reason this is getting dumped on by shorties is because they're helping institutions load up on shares.  Most retail investors don't know a thing about Medicare which is why this is flying under the radar. I know it's not the sexiest product but this is going to be a cash cow in 2-3 years.

734,DD," 2 questions.

1. How many of those calls are sold naked? My guess is not as many as you'd think. I personally sold some $11 CC's as a way to lower my cost basis. Plenty of others did the same. Some don't even own shares and went with the PMCC strategy. Not every call needs to be hedged because they already are.

2. Does the interest rate to short a stock apply retroactively or just to new positions looking to short? I suspect it's for new positions looking to short. The brave souls who decided to short this stock at $7 are certainly dumb...

898,IMO," Pretty sure there's zero proof they lied about preorders, in fact the CEO clarified that quite awhile ago.

Also, the fact that they ran in the race recently is ultimately a good thing IMO, they showed that they have a working product that can drive offroad. Their main issue was not having enough battery charge, as well as navigation issues (admittedly due to inexperienced driver/navigator). No one expected them to win or even come close, they were just testing their product in a very public way.

So that leaves an outdated incident with a fire and complaints of a sketchy CEO. Almost sounds exactly like what happened with Tesla.....",supbrother,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nek2vk/ride_lordstown_motors_to_host_open_house/gyhgq59/,0.082,0.78,0.137,0.7675

Lastly, they announced their partnership with Walgreens today. Which should help them to continue to expand coverage and deliver better care.

It might take generations to understand it.

Some talking points: 

1) If they don't want to eat us (there are easier ways to create protein than catching and processing a meat sack) but want to exploit resources, then perhaps they want to trade, buy extractive industries (mining, heavy equipment).

2) If they don't have the concept of trade, and only take by force, then we're toast anyway. Buy bugout gear and live off the grid for as long as you can. Patriot Supply and Readywise are not publicly traded, but Coleman is as part of Newell Brands (NWL) and just had a stock split. Any of the gun manufacturers would likely do well, IF they were publicly traded. Only Ruger (RGR and Colt (Olin mnfg OLN) will do you any good before the market tanks due to the aforementioned bugout.

3) If they are just studying us, and had an equivalent of a NSF grant to study indigenous species, and stupidly left some equipment behind, then, by all means, find out if Lockhead-Martin, GE, SpaceX etc, got access to it and quietly invest. If the DOD got the item first, go Lockhead-Martin or General Dynamics. Otherwise, if the item was IT related, especially storage, NVIDIA, Intel, etc. If it was communications, maybe a SPAC like FIVG, or Raytheon.

4) If they turn out to be benevolent, and want us as a ""partner"" of some sort, then we go with the space tech and extractive models. a) Extracting elements from asteroids is substantially cheaper once you are out there, but you have to get people, resources, support and some medium of exchange out there. Buy SPCX, since Musk has the vision. b) You also will need a bunch of new psychiatrists since this won't be easy for anyone to deal with. c) Designers for all the alien themed clothing, cars and tchotchkes that will emerge. d) engineers and mathematicians to make sure space vehicles don't end up in the sun.

1164,MGM," you also negate the shit balance sheet that MGM has and how they make $.51 / $1 profit on their city center properties vs other properties because they needed to be bailed out in 2008 

there are a lot of very important things you either are too smooth brain to understand and should not be investing or ....",Rick_Perrys_Asshole,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ne8d41/discussion_reopening_trade_aircruise_casinos_oil/gyfuog3/,0.0,0.855,0.145,0.8399
1165,FIVE," Wait... Let me get this straight. You're saying that MGM is better situated because they have FIVE casinos... In the casino capital of the US? I mean, that doesn't really work so well as justification. That's property that they have debt on, too. And they took on a lot of debt during covid.

You have a point that they might have plans to expand out. But, again, debt.

Their balance sheet is too iffy to me. But there is a casino chain in Vegas that has my tits jacked.",ThrowawayLegendZ,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ne8d41/discussion_reopening_trade_aircruise_casinos_oil/gygmybp/,0.098,0.825,0.077,-0.4408

1167,MGM," I get what ur saying, but MGM is buying up hurting Casinos while were bouncing back from covid the same trip i bought 3 months ago has 2.5x price increase people are traveling.

1168,NOW," Look up the difference between Contango and Backwardation (two terms to describe commodity forward curve structure). Right now raw goods are in Backwardation meaning near term prices are higher than farther out price. 

This price structure incentivizes more supply NOW as opposed to later, as well as the physical good to not be stored in a warehouse or elsewhere for future use. 

In short, demand is higher than supply in the near term. The forward curve is betting that more supply will be brought online in later months, or there will be less demand leading to lower realized spot price.",yungaccountant,8,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nemlpe/are_commodity_futures_going_against_the/gyh2gig/,0.05,0.902,0.048,0.2023
