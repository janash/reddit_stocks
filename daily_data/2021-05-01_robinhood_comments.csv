0,NOK," I learned this yesterday when my NOK calls I sold at $4.5 weren’t exercised despite the stock jumping to like $4.86 on open. I was legitimately worried it would drop back below $4.50 and  they’d still not be assigned. 

Ah well, best to learn these things via covered calls on cheaper stocks with money you can afford, right?  And it wasn’t my loss, it was theirs, so all good.",heavymcd,12,/r/RobinHood/comments/n267my/when_you_sell_a_covered_call_on_robin_hood_and/gwhlcjq/,0.085,0.761,0.154,0.749

2,AAPL," It depends entirely on the stock and circumstances. I sold all my TLRY when it hit 60 because it shot up so quick there was no way it wasn’t coming back down, put the profits into APHA to try and make a merger play, then APHA shot up some and I sold 25%. 

On the other hand, I’ve bought AAPL shares and don’t plan on selling until I’m close to retirement.

I’ve also watched shares go down -20% only to bounce back and become my biggest winners. And I’ve seen the opposite happen too

8,RH," I’d call them now, contact fraud alert, and ask to speak to a supervisor. By going immediately to fraud - although it is technically not fraud at this point - your request becomes urgent and actionable. If fees are charged. You can ask them to waive them based on your history with them. IMHO - RH is responsible by not providing a remedy for this.

They might need to close and reissue a new acct number - but they could give you provisional credit until investigation is complete 

Tell them you tried contacted RH unsuccessfully and your bank will duke it out with them. This should keep RH for penalizing you. No harm. No foul. Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
