4,PLTR,"My take on this is the emotional and hype response of today's markets will view $28 as a low valuation. That said, you are not wrong and I think anything below $28 is a decent entry for those willing to be in this position for the long haul. My 2 cents is this continues to cool off for the next week, I think we see low 20s again before the end of January. Since it recently broke above 25$ again, it has closed lower than it has opened for seven consecutive days, meaning there is really heavy selling pressure when the market is open. Retail can only hold this for so long, and I think it will succumb to the selling pressure during market hours in the near future.

I do like PLTR as a long term hold, and I think it makes sense for leaps as well, but I think the current market sentiment is strongly indicating we should wait before we enter.",0.062,0.873,0.066,0.1564

10,PLTR,"Coming from a background in data security and specifically data loss prevention software, I have a few concerns. 

Products in the market that try to aggregate data fall into a few pitfalls. It’s not easy and some of these data repositories don’t like to be aggregated. 

It’s encouraging that the defense and intelligence communities are on board but as someone that has sold to these communities, they buy a lot and leave it to be shelf ware. I would be curious to know how customers like using it and if it is effective. Getting write ups from three letter agencies is basically impossible so I would assume those reviews would be on the commercial side. 

I also see data security conflicts. What kind of access does this software have to the underlying data silos. Is it copying or storing data? If the data is held in secure locations can it even access it? Do data privacy laws apply? GDPR? New California related data privacy? This will become more and more of an issue as individuals demand access to their data. It may not matter to the agencies but it sure does to the commercials. 

I’ll watch the demo. I’m curious how this differs from something like a SEIM solution like splunk.

82,PLTR,"I’m on a similar boat, opened at 13.5 because I was feeling hopeless and some guy who claimed to have called Nio the next big thing was then talking about PLTR. 

These numbers and revenue growth do make me quite suspicious and I’d like to have a look at their financial statements myself. If you look at the financial statements alone sure maybe they paint a nice picture but without detailed review of the notes you never know what really is going on.

And if expense increases are primarily due to stock based compensation and direct listing costs shouldn’t that make you suspicious? Especially since your main thesis is growth than a significant R&D expense or even higher SG&A is not a bad thing. 

And what if they are actually doing significant R&D but they decide too early in the development process that the software they are developing is feasible and can be sold. If this were the case (I’m not saying it is, I haven’t even looked at their 10-K) then their assets would be growing unsustainably and could mean significant write downs to come.

This is the type of stuff you should be on the lookout for and that sort of information is not available on first look at the financial statements. You require a detailed look at their notes and a detailed look at their competitors’ notes to see what the wider industry is doing and only then can you make an informed decision.

93,ABNB,"So I believe that ABNB will return to profitability before any of the other hotel chains.

Essentially it’s just software and advertising, at its core business. Highly scaleable. Taxation is coming but that is a good thing, when tax comes, it locks in regulation without further encroachment or outright “banning” ABNB. 

Local governments are hungry for revenue and if ABNB will deliver those tax revenues, so be it.

The ABNB business was actually recovering through the pandemic because of local travel or road trip based, check in to a private home or room vs a hotel lobby etc.

Additionally, Airbnb doesn’t depend on google search for their traffic, they generate most of their own traffic from the app. And it’s highly scaleable on the supply side because I was initially a traveler on ABNB but then turned into a host. So users provide both methods.

ABNB, unlike UBER uses a non-depreciating/low depreciating asset such as real estate vs a car so the ability for hosts to continue generating revenue from their real estate is almost infinite. So prices can go lower and adjust, the host will still continue to host, why? Because the spare bedroom/home/apt is just sitting there regardless, why not generate cash with it.

I can see ABNB expanding into events exclusively bookable on ABNB. Due to the traffic they already generate, buying event bright or an event company on the cheap, integrating it into the app, and then directly advertising it to users/hosts. That’s the next pivot for ABNB, IMO.

Of course, the fact that they bought their own shares without notifying shorters beforehand was unique about the VW squeeze and that will probably not happen with GME.

285,GME,"I'll start with the basics of call options, but forgive me if you are familiar already.

A call option is a contract that gives the holder the right to buy a stock at an agreed upon price by an agreed upon date.  If I buy a call with a $60 strike price that is set to expire Friday, January 22, that means I have the right to buy shares for $60, no matter what they are actually worth.  

It's very good for me if the call goes ""in the money"" because that means the stock is worth more than my strike.  I can exercise my option and you are forced to sell me those shares for $60.  Awesome if the stock is actually trading for, say, $65.  That's profit! (You also have to factor in what I paid to buy the call option in the first place, but that's not really important right now.)

On the other side, somebody sold me that $60 call option or ""wrote"" the contract.  They know that if the stock never reaches the strike price, they will make money.  This is because I paid them for the option contract (money right in their pocket), then they know I won't exercise my right to buy.  Of course, I wouldn't exercise my right to buy a stock for $60 if I can plainly see it's trading for only $55 on the open market.  That would be stupid.

What happened today is that there were many, many call options in circulation that gave many people the right to buy GME at $60.  Nobody who sold those options really expected they'd have to actually come up with those shares.  What would you do if you owed me a bunch of stocks for $60 apiece and you didn't have any to give me... and then you saw the price rise to 55... then 58... then 60... then 65...

You would probably be freaking out a bit, right?  What if the stock goes up to $100 and you know you have to give them to me for a loss?!  Ouch!  So, you think to yourself, ""Screw it, I am going to buy all the shares I need to cover my call option, even if I take a loss.  It's better to take a small loss than a huge one.""

In fact, when you sell naked calls (no ownership of the underlying stock, unlike covered calls), it's only because your broker is letting you.  Your broker is on the hook if you personally go bankrupt.  Remember that naked calls have theoretically unlimited loss potential.  The price could go up as high as needed to wipe you out.

Your broker is likely going to be the one (for us little retail investors) who puts the foot down and says, ""Enough.  I am worried you are going to be wiped out, so I'm making you cover your ass, or this becomes my problem.""",0.091,0.823,0.086,-0.3252

Why? Why would you do that? Elements of the fund's performance and the success of that performance cannot be disentangled, otherwise you're making a completely pointless hypothetical about nothing useful, all masquerading as a half-argument. 

Not knocking you OP, but saying ""yeah but what about BB without looking at its past?"" is equally goofy. What would be the point of this? You can't disentangle a company from its past, and every institution and asset manager betting against BB - in other words, the parties that have the influence to bring the hammer down on BB - are looking at exactly that: its past. Further, they might even engage in aggressive short-selling campaigns using exactly that as their flagship tool. You and I can sit here and be very future-thinking about BB, and that's great, but that is a pointless argument to investors who have concerns, many of which are legitimate, about this firm's past. 

If the firm's *past* has proven that the company's management is avoidant of aggressive PR campaigns to showcase what it's doing, then the firm's current and short-term future technological breakthroughs are very cute but they mean nothing if there's a 10-year history of those being suppressed by corporate inaction and no meaningful indications that that will change anytime soon. If public sentiment for the *past* two decades has been that this is a zombie company that needs to die, then it doesn't matter what some luminaries in WallStreetBets think: the overwhelming majority of society has nothing significant and relatable to go off of other than *past* performance.

666,GOOG,"It depends what you mean by normal I suppose. We're not seeing anything we haven't seen before, but market conditions are currently very good for those who want to take large amounts of risks and make large amounts of money quickly.

Most of what you see on WSBs is survivor bias so I would be cautious about using them as a representative example of what people are doing or what returns people are making. What is true is that buying calls on random stocks has been an extremely profitable strategy over the last 6 or so months and this wouldn't typically be the case.

The last time I remember this happening was at the start of 2018. I remember back then most of WSB was buying $SPY calls and posting huge profits. About a month later the S&P500 dropped 12% then later in the year it dropped 20% which brought an end to some of the more reckless risk taking. Newbies today haven't learnt these lessons. They haven't seen meme stocks plunge 90% or markets drop 10%+ in a week which historically has happened quite frequently.

If you want to be consistently profitable and not get wiped out, you need to manage your risk in a way that allows for periods of extreme volatility. If you're buying stocks with fairly reasonable valuations, you'll be fine. The problem is newbies may not understand why you would want to buy a stock like GOOG when you could buy a TSLA and potentially get 500% annual returns.

While GOOG may not see 500% annual returns, it also won't drop 90% after posting a few bad earnings. This isn't to say you should never buy calls or TSLA stock, but when you do you need to ensure it's a small enough percentage of your portfolio that you won't get wiped out when you're wrong. That means less profits which means a lot of people without experience of how volatile markets can be over expose themselves while things are good.

If you're concerned about your strategy just ask yourself how your portfolio would have performed if you were investing at the start of 2020, just before the market crash. If you would have come out okay, you're probably doing something right.",0.094,0.787,0.119,0.8942

Some housing markets around the world have seen even longer bull markets, canada is on their 20th year of big real estate gains currently. With biden's policies I think US will have a bigger housing boom then the mid 2000s, could become like canada where people hoping for a drop  but it just won't come for a long while. 

One thing that is important though, before you invest have at least 1 year of emergency savings. I can only hope for the best. Also I do agree with some who says this is an investing tragedy for those who just started out, US' fundamentals definitely isn't as strong yet there is a historic long bull market, chances are there will be years of low return in the next 40 years, best way is to increase your position in emerging markets, especially on East and SE Asia, they do seem to handle both 2008 and the 2020 crisis somewhat better, stock gains over the long term will likely be stronger than the US.",0.096,0.693,0.211,0.9732

Real world usage in China means that frequently there are 3-4 cars in the queue. This means it's a 20-25 minute wait. During battery swap you have to be outside of the car so have fun waiting in pouring rain or blazing hot humid weather. 

Supercharger is meant for long distance travel.  It takes roughly 20 to 30 minutes from 20 to 80%. 

Given Nio cars have shorter range to comparable Teslas, there is honestly not much competitive advantage to this approach. 

Tesla is battery constrained while Nio has to allocate significant amount of battery packs that should go into cars. Each station has 13 packs that should go into 13 new Nio cars generating $650000 (assuming $50k price) in revenue are now instead owned by the company. 

According to your own example, 500 stations = 6500 batteries = 6500 fewer cars sold to customers. That is a potential loss of $325 million revenue that should have gone to the top line. 

The downside is that the more cars Nio sells, the more swapping station and extra batteries they have to set aside. This fact along means Nio will not scale at the rate of Tesla.

You're not looking at the data, you're cherry picking data to make it look better than it actually is. You left out a lot of very important data, like the fact that people don't charge their EVs from 0-100% but 20-80%. Or the fact that you still need to drive to a swapping station, wait for other to be done, place the car in the right location, and that's assuming that the closest swapping location even had a spot available at the right time in the first place. Realistically, you're going to require much longer than 5 minutes to get your battery swapped.

> NIO has completed over 1m swaps. This shows there is not only a demand but it is efficient or why would anyone use it instead of charging it at a supercharger (NIO also has).

People are not using it because it's efficient, they're using it because they have no other option because the parking garage at their home or office is not equipped with chargers yet.

It will increase efficiency but in many cases you will still arrive while someone else is swapping a battery already, unless the station is horribly inefficient and frequently idle.

> By increasing the number of stations, this also becomes a non issue.

Increasing the number of stations faster than the amount of cars on the road would be economically unviable. From a business point of view you will always want to have just enough stations, or preferably a couple fewer than required. It's the same as theme parks, having rollercoasters without waiting lines costs more money.

> Of course a Tesla owner can recharge 50% but that means he/she would have to recharge it again sooner than later. This is a big deal for those who live in a big city like most Chinese because they don’t have an assigned parking spot.

You can still place a charging station at an unassigned parking spot. You can't place a battery swap station without removing the parking spot though.

> NIO owners can also recharge at home or at a supercharger. Battery swapping station is an additional alternative. NIO even has recharging vans for emergencies.

872,ATI,"They're one of the big two in the utility scale industry (NEXTracker being the other).  In my opinion they're one of the best for flat sites with contiguous land, or areas of high winds (like the desert southwest).  Their design has significant benefits to operating costs, so that's also a plus.  We installed some when I was with a construction firm back in 2011 at the onset of utility scale solar growth and those systems are still going strong.

My biggest concern with ATI is their ability to evolve and adapt.  Their central drive line design (one motor rotates dozens of tracker rows) is preferred for high winds, but at the same time it limits land utilization for oddshaped and non-contiguous parcels.  NEXTracker has a bigger benefit in areas like the PJM market when the parcels are peicemeal and flanked by wetlands, forests, and farmlands.  NEXTracker and other competitors that have each row track independently are also developing and selling software dubbed ""true tracking"" which allows the tracker to more smartly adjust to cloud cover, rolling topography that causes row to row shading, and so on.  This cheap software implementation can boost generation upwards of like 2-5% a year with little capex cost (and minor licensing costs) which can be huge on life cycle revenue.  ATI is behind on that front and their linked tracker rows means even when they develop it, it won't have the same precision as the independent row trackers.

So, without having the insight on the company financials and pipelines, I would consider ATI as the ""old, reliable, and possibly cheapest $/W for capex and opex"""" but they could eventually start getting outflanked by their competitors if their innovation falls behind.  Also keep in mind that more module manufacturers are trying to buy up smaller tracker firms and implement systems for their modules, so they can vertically integrate module sales and tracker sales.  I would say those efforts may ultimately pose a threat to under cut the ATI and NEXTracker sales if they start getting wider adoption.

The short sellers, however, ignored some fundamental catalysts like the new console cycle and that ps5 and xbox one would work with game disks (correct me if I'm wrong here).

- They also ignored the fact that GME's online sales had gone up quite significantly. All of this led some redditors early in the game to believe that this was a company that would not go bankrupt. They then had a deal with Microsoft which pumped the stock higher.

- Enter Ryan Cohen. The founder of Chewy ($CHWY) saw the potential in GME and wrote an angry letter imploring them to find better ways of leveraging their popularity and shifting their business online. He has since upped his investment and has more comrades on board.

- All of the above meant that GME was priced very low and was actually a value investment because of the good things coming up for this company. Institutions and retail investors started buying this stock and it kept going up.

- There is evidence that the short sellers kept increasing their position hoping for a reversal that never came. Now their brokers are restricting short selling for GME and as the stock pumps higher, they are closer and closer to getting margin called.

- When that happens, they will be forced to close their positions and buy shares. Creating a short squeeze. The catch here is that there are not enough shares available to buy and close their positions. Essentially, they would have to buy it from insiders or institutions who will most probably not be willing to sell their stake.

- The above would create an infinite short squeeze which would make us all very rich if we could time our exit.
