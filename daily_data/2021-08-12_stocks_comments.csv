1,FB," I think we should all be looking at the big picture and wondering what exactly their game plan is. What this thread shows is that everyone is thinking of Reddits IPO like a Facebook or Snapchat IPO. And maybe it is but reddit has underlying mechanics that seem to make it different to me.

1. Reddit gives monetary incentive to engage with it. Through giving out currency, it's actively encouraging people to post content that others will enjoy. This separates them from other platforms like FB and YouTube that only want people to engage.

2. The award system is more than it seems too. Most people recognize it as what it is, the ability for the rich to emphasize opinions they like. It also works fine as a tip system for people to use. But the big thing is that it can show when a minority feels strongly about an opinion, a sentiment that would likely get lost in the downvotes.

3. Self moderating communities encourage reddit to have only mild interference. The reason it's important is that it is difficult for the admins to step in and regulate specific types of content without anyone noticing. The communities know their members and content, interference from higher up is a problem.

4. That self moderation means that they're fundamentally different. Instead of broadcasting every opinion into the public ether, like with FB and Twitter, you're speaking to a portion of a specific community. So rather than monetizing a debate stage, they're monetizing a mall with individual shops. They're monetizing communication in a much less direct way than others, but it's also very similar.

These things may make reddit different, but that doesn't mean I think they're good or bad inherently. I just wanted to point out that this platform should be valued differently than others.",knowledgepancake,1,/r/stocks/comments/p31ijc/reddit_is_now_valued_at_more_than_10_billion_the/h8p2bpi/,0.041,0.761,0.198,0.9948

16,VS," Personal experience and just anecdotal evidence, then trying to think of approaching it with my personal company I work in sales and as an advertising buyer. We don't find Facebook advertising that useful for our Fintech product and like google ads much more instead. 

Moderating a Facebook group is difficult. You still get a lot of mod VS user conflict, but since users can't remove posts, a lot of content tends to be the lowest common denominator or trash. Engagement and controversial content get seen first, where downvotes can push that away on Reddit for a more pleasant experience. The only Facebook groups I use, and other young people, and pretty much functional only or closed off. Craigslist replacement of ""buy nothing"" to find treasure in the neighborhood junk before it goes to the trash. Ticket exchanges. Fantasy football conversations with league mates. You can't advertise in the group and these are all not really providing much advertising helpful data. 

Whereas each subreddit is purely interest-driven, a bowling company does not need to waste time chasing down their demographics nearly as much, they can go STRAIGHT to /r/bowling, and then those users are they go across Reddit. Every single eyeball is probably worth it for brand recognition or mature buyers' interest. 

Older citizens seem to actually use Facebook groups for more socializing, but you can easily see how they get toxic or weird fast, which hurts engagement. Even if you hate every single user in /r/bowling, you are going to come back and look at it if there is quality content upvoted by the users.

A lot of Facebook advertising starts by demographic, which means not every eyeball and accidental click you pay for is actually interested in bowling. Active users of /r/bowling are probably all buyers of bowling balls and much more mature and ready customers.

NIO delivered 21,896 vehicles in the second quarter, beating analyst estimates. Vehicle deliveries provide an indication of demand for NIO's main source of revenue as well as the company's productive capacity. NIO expects to deliver between 23,000 and 25,000 vehicles in Q3 FY 2021 despite still facing a number of supply chain challenges.

NIO Financial Results: Analysis 

NIO Inc. (NIO) reported Q2 FY 2021 earnings that beat analyst estimates. The company posted a loss per share of RMB0.42 ($0.06), a smaller loss than what analysts expected. Revenue also surpassed expectations, rising 127.2% year over year (YOY). NIO's vehicle deliveries, which were reported at the beginning of July, came in at 21,896 for the quarter, exceeding analysts' forecasts. The company's shares dipped slightly in post-market trading. Over the past year, NIO's shares have provided a total return of 238.5%, well above the S&P 500's total return of 33.4%.

NIO Vehicle Deliveries

Most of NIO's revenue is generated through the sale of vehicles. NIO delivered a total of 21,896 vehicles in Q2 FY 2021, up 111.9% from the year-ago quarter. Total vehicle deliveries can be broken down into deliveries of three models:

4,433 ES8s, the company's 6-seater and 7-seater flagship premium smart electric SUV 9,935 ES6s, the company's 5-seater high-performance premium smart electric SUV 7,528 EC6s, the company's 5-seater premium electric coupe SUV 

The number of vehicle deliveries provides an indication of the demand for NIO's vehicles as well as the company's ability to scale production. NIO has faced a number of supply chain issues this year, including challenges related to the global semiconductor shortage. The company was forced to shut down one of its factories for five days near the end of the first quarter due to the chip shortage.

""While the global supply chain still faces uncertainties, we have been working closely with our partners to improve the overall supply chain production capacity,"" said William Bin Li, company founder, chairman, and chief executive officer.

Total vehicle sales were RMB7.9 billion, up 127.0% compared to the year-ago quarter. Vehicle sales accounted for about 93.7% of NIO's total revenue for the quarter. The company's vehicle margin, a measure of gross margin for vehicle sales, was 20.3% compared to 9.7% in the year-ago quarter. When vehicle margin is higher, it means that more vehicle sales are being generated relative to the costs of making those vehicles. NIO said that the YOY rise in its vehicle margin was driven by an increase in vehicle delivery volume, higher average selling prices, and lower material costs.

NIO Vehicle Delivery and Revenue Outlook

NIO expects vehicle deliveries for Q3 FY 2021 to be between 23,000 and 25,000, which would represent a YOY increase of approximately 88.4% to 104.8%. It expects revenue to rise between 96.9% and 112.8% compared to the third quarter of FY 2020.

 

Possible run up to $100 by Oct. 2021.


 

Deutsche Bank's first look on NIO Q2 earnings: Lower gross margin likely due to higher supply chain inefficiencies.

205,ABC," Sure, let me clarify. Like I said, depositing and withdrawing money from the brokerage account is irrelevant. The only thing that matters for tax purposes are sales. It doesn’t matter if you leave the money in the account or take it out. It doesn’t become taxable when the money is withdrawn, it becomes taxable at the sell event.

Let me rework your example to show you. You have $5k, and you buy ABC at $100/share (50 shares).

You bought all of them when you clicked the button in one nice tidy lot. Your share lot for the buy (let’s say it’s today) would be like this:

50 @ $100 - 8/12/21

The date is now 10/12/21. ABC has gone up to $120/share, and you want to take out $2.4k because you need money to buy a dragonglass dildo. So you put in a sell order for 20 shares ($2,400 total). Your gain on each share is $20 from when you bought, which is less than a year ago, so it’s processed as income for tax purposes. So you’ll pay income tax on your profit/gain *only*, based on what you paid when you originally bought those shares. So you’ll pay income taxes (at your income bracket including this $400) on $400 ($20 x 20 shares).",notherday11,5,/r/stocks/comments/p2we5l/rstocks_daily_discussion_options_trading_thursday/h8oywtd/,0.02,0.863,0.116,0.9534

269,WM," A lot of people hate on T, calling it dead money, but the reasons they give you are often in the past. I take the opposite view. I'm invested and will hold through the WM/Disc merger. Here's why:

* Mobile is growing: 789k net adds (1% last Q)
* Fiber is growing: 246k net adds (3.8% in last Q)
* HBO max is growing: 2.8 million net adds (6.3% last quarter)

When Warner spins off it will give you some growth that you can sell or keep. They are focussed on growing fiber (which I think is a great product and people aren't giving them credit for) and they have a great driver for excellent network coverage with FirstNet.

They refinanced their debt during COVID so their interest expense has gone down. People aren't giving them credit for their recent moves and are focussing on past mistakes.

And there was a split. However, my experience with these type of 'different' splits (not a simple 2:1, 3:2, etc) is that there is usually an acquisition or similar operation involved. Looking for 'dhr 2016 7th of may' in Google I get this:  
  
http://investors.danaher.com/2016-07-02-Danaher-Corporation-Completes-Separation-of-Fortive-Corporation  
  
There was a spin-off that year for a part of their business. So if you owned shares of $DHR you would also get shares of $FTV (the spin-off). This operation is what caused the 'split', reflecting the change in the business structure and compensating shareholders with shares from the new company.  
  
Anyhow, I prefer using Macrotrends to confirm 'true' stock splits:
