1. Whenever you go grocery shopping, put away any change below 10$ in your wallet. With this trick you can save up to 100$ each month!

2. When grocery shopping switching from brands to the store brand can quickly add up! Even switching one or two products to the store brand can net you 50$ every month! Remember to put away what you saved after shopping!

3. Do you really need that 10$ latte every day? Think about it! That's 200$ alone every single month!

4. Put away 50$ at the beginning of the month. If you only save what's left at the end of the month you'll spend it but if it isn't there then there's no way for you to accidentaly spend it!

5. Do you collect loyalty points? Maybe you should! And the same goes for coupons. With no more than 2-3 hours spent every week you could quickly save 50$ or more each month!

6. This might be a bit controversial but doing good can actually help you save money! Donating blood can, depending on the organization, pay you another 50$ every month!""

Eh, not necessarily.  It's a tail that wags the dog, and whoever gets out earlier wins.

Imagine you're a primary dealer writing 100* 45c GME option for one month out.  And imagine that the realized volatility will only be 100%.  Then anyone doing delta hedging for that 45c GME call will be buying up, assuming they're correct about the volatility, nearly 4k shares to hedge that call.  Hence 'buying the underlying'.  So even if GME were to go up to 80 by next month, if it does so ""smoothly"", without too many wild daily swings, whoever wrote the hedge made vastly more off the trade than you did.  And they will quickly sell those shares.

WSB has learned to weponize gamma, but this isn't exactly a ""steal money from boomers"" thing.

On Tuesday they announced via Twitter that they believe GME is going to $20 anyone betting against it is foolish.
They said they would give their 5 reasons in an 11:30am livestream on Wednesday which many pointed out coincided with the inauguration.
At the exact time this tweet was sent (within 60 seconds), a massive put option was placed on GME. It implies that Citron (who have been know to be bearish on GME) are trying to spook the market to drive down the price so they aren’t losing as much money.
Most companies betting against GME have been doing so for a year when the stock was around $5. They were predicting GME would end right then and there. This obviously hasn’t happened.

Then yesterday one hour before they were to go on live, Citron tweets that the are postponing the stream today because, you know, an inauguration for probably the most significant political event in the last four years.
Also this tweet was riddled with spelling errors including “Gold Bless America.”

Many people at this point are suspecting Citron is trying to extend the period on which GME’s
Price stays down.

Today the stream got delayed due to “technical issues.” At the time the stream meant to go up, GME was within $2 of their all time high and up 16% on the day.

This guy is Andrew Left, head of the Citron (Shitron around these parts) Group (edit: I’ve been informed that Citron Group is just Andrew Left, not an actual group of people). He goes around and shorts (bets against) stocks, causing the price to go down, and everyone else who holds that stock gets screwed.

EDIT: Gotten a few questions about how his short trade could affect the price like that. From what I’ve read, since I wasn’t a part of this sub when he did it, he made a big deal out of shorting GME, and apparently this lazy manipulation is the norm for him. Anyway, the market’s reaction to this guy (who’s been right before) betting millions against a stock was to also undervalue it, thereby causing the value of the shares to drop.

This time, Shitron shorted GameStop, but he went too hard, and the stock reversed when Chewy.com co-founder Ryan Cohen took a 10% stake in GameStop with the intention of reorganizing the business to be more “Amazon for gaming” instead of “Sears for gaming”. Knowing that Shitron bet too hard against GME, and that Ryan Cohen presented great potential for the company, WSB is buying up as many shares as they can before the short investors have to buy back the shares they shorted earlier.

That brings us to now, when Shitron is trying to push the stock price down, WSB is betting it’ll go up, because Shitron won’t have any shares left to buy back at reasonable prices, causing a Short Squeeze (I believe this is called a Short Squeeze, because the holder of the short position is squeezed out of it? Someone will REEEE if I’m wrong about that). That’s what we’re all waiting for. All signs point to it happening within a week or two, maybe even sooner. When this happened to VW, their stock went up from 200 to 1000 during a short squeeze.

We’ve got a narrative where small-time retail investors feel that they can be modern-day Robin Hoods. Many have gotten in just in the past 4 days, and have already been battle hardened by **several** 20% intraday dips. That’s a once in a lifetime swing for an index investor. Not for GME gang, though. 

What’s more is that these small-time investors have all been **rewarded** for holding onto this stock. Not only did they all benefit financially from not panic selling in a dip... they’re able to take part in this cultural movement to save a company that for many of them was a beloved childhood fixture. 

As these recent-wave retail investors are rewarded, they are more likely to inform friends about this once in a lifetime play. Most newcomers will make relatively small investments ($500-$10k), but if there are several hundred thousand newcomers in play...

Even BEFORE we consider RC’s plans or the underlying fundamentals, the shorts must be absolutely **pissing themselves** being up against this kind of sentiment.

You may not be aware of an awesome deal that you can benefit from GameStop. 🥜🥜

#Read below to see how you can benefit by 400% from GAMESTOP (the store, not stock) with just $15 💸💸💸💸

GameStop offers PowerUp rewards membership.

There is a free tier, and $15 yearly membership tier. 
Buy the $15 membership right now...you’ve spent more than that on meaningless stuff...

##[Link to Join ($15 for digital; $20 for physical magazine)](https://www.gamestop.com/poweruprewards/) 


So what does this $15 get you?

A $5 coupon every month that you can use on any item, including gift cards, and online gaming stores. Any of them...all of them. (PSN/ Steam / XLive, N eShop)

**This $5 coupon expires every calendar month. You must use it before the end of the month. If you purchase a gift card, obviously that amount in GC would not expire.**

After 3 months you break even, after the 4th month you have a higher percentage gain than your RH account. 

So you spend $15 for membership, and get $60 in the course of 12 months. 

Your net profit is $45 (easily $55-60 in net profit with promos). 

If every month you pick up a $10 gaming card (PSN/XLive/STEAM/ N eShop), you only end up paying $5 each month. 

At the end of 12 months, you spent an actual $75, but ended up getting $120 worth of stuff. It’s actually more like $130-$140 because they give you a welcome coupon along with the 1st month’s coupon, plus a birthday coupon as well. 

Use it for yourself, or if you’re not a gamer, save the GC purchases each month and gift it to someone for birthday/holidays.


You can buy the membership for children’s hospitals too (see if they want physical magazine or digital to share the copy with all the patients).

After you’ve gotten a taste of 400% returns,

Using RH? Worried about if you have margin enabled? It’s only available if you have the monthly gold paid subscription, and then you would have to hit agree to it...so check to see if you have gold, then check to see if margin is off.

Hi. Have you met us? We’re 1M+ vaccinated strong. We don’t know **how** to *not* say stupid shit my guy.

We don’t think: we just REEEEEE.

Don’t worry, we’ve literally been under SEC investigation multiple times for way baseless shit, and we’ve made it out every time . We are not the QAnon of the markets: **we’re the 4Chan of the markets** (it’s right in our bio fam).

YOLO, REEEE, shitpost and be merry: r/wallstreetbets is the Fifth Estate where anyone is free to join, get vaccinated, and post gain and loss porn. Now that we’ve fully gone mainstream there are more shills and pump and dumpers than your mom’s bf.

A much more realistic rallying cry is to ask all the true REEtards and autists (and you handful of Aspergers who come here to laugh at and slum with the other half of the spectrum) to do our individual part to help the mods keep up with this animal house; hit the remove post automod vote button whenever you see shit that isn’t in keeping with the vibe of this sub.

Heck, I am often in the Tesla investor forum and I am long Tesla with a substantial amount of shares and lots of gains there.

Every day I find out and can analyze with others any tidbit relating to vehicles or batteries and what it means. I understand very deeply what their opportunities are and what the competition is and hell yeah, I am loooonnng. Mark my words, barring some big upset, Tesla is on pace to being worth $5K-10K per share by 2030. Very few people out there understand their competitive strengths and I grow tired explaining it.

1. The short squeeze won't happen
 - ""Why is there a high short interest?"" 
 - $40 - Open borrow at decent rate
 - Plenty of options 
 - Trading phenomenom - A lot of call volume 
	- He has no problems selling the company higher 
	- As long as borrow is available, insiders are still selling, and company needs money, there will be no squeeze

2. Numbers don't lie
 - Citron was first short sellers to start going long on Tesla 
 - NPD report on GME. Harper Sales up 23%, GME down 9% - losing to Amazon, best buy, target, walmart 
 - Current business is drowning

3. Valuations matter
 - This is a retailer, and valuation must be based on other retailers 
 - Analysts has $12 target on the price 
 - 2021 ebda - $330 million, street is at $71 million, Citron expects negative ebda
 	- Target stock price should be at $26 
 - Trading at 40x ebda
	- Apple is trading at 20x 
 - GME is expensive 

4. Know who are on the opposite side of the trade 
 - Something about reddit being geniuses and he needs to get on Tinder 
 
5. Company can become your biggest enemy 
 - $1 Billion in debt 
 - To make an acquisition they will need to sell a lot of stock 
 - Either this company will be JC Penny or Blockbuster",0.084,0.869,0.047,-0.8176

1062,GME,"If it squeezes then realistically it should go over 100 pretty easy.  Its impossible to say how high it will end up though.  The more people hold the higher it goes.  There are more shares that are short that MUST be bought back than shares in existence.  So those shares need to be bought back more than once in some cases.  If no one sells then the price keeps going up for shares available and if they dont pay that price then they pay interest on it while the price skyrockets.  

&#x200B;

VW had a short squeeze in 08 that went from 200 to almost a thousand.  Our base level for GME is probably in the mid $30's right now (what I would expect it at without the added pressure and squeeze war).  GME has more shorts than VW had.  So if it goes up a similar percentage it would be $150, but remember we have more shorts so it will be worse if people hold (higher end).  Tesla has been a much longer timeframe squeeze but people keep asking why is Tesla worth more than every other car company ... its the squeeze.  

&#x200B;

This squeeze will likely be a roller coaster until there is a catalyst.  March earning report seems like a good candidate for such a catalyst, if GME beats like they did last earnings then expect the squeeze to be like a rocket (like VW)",0.023,0.846,0.131,0.9637

1) Tech companies currently trade well above their earnings across the market

One could make an argument it’s undervalued and should rise to 120. Fun bonus fact! The real short squeeze hasn’t happened yet. Shorts aren’t covering and they may never. I saw a tweet from some hedge giy saying that a real short squeeze would require >150.

Well if GME rockets to 120 were gonna get tons of FOMO from regular investors especially as this is starting to hit real news outlets.

Good stuff there.  Verify it after with more research.


What I'm seeing is cherry picked numbers by the shorts in a lot of media.  While a lot of short term research is showing a sell rating, others like market edge give it a Long rating with an improving score of 0 on a scale of 0 to -4.  They upgraded from neutral on 8/17/2020 and it's gone up 647% since then.


Ford equity research has it at Average rating (upgraded from below average) and the average was reiterated on 1/15/2021.  What average means is that they expect it to perform in line with the market over the next 6-12 months.


What I see being priced in with stock prices rising is the closure of underperforming stores and a pivot to e-commerce while maintaining their retail core competencies.


The negative rants from shorts I hear too.  I'm hearing cherry picked numbers that do look bad on the surface as well as anecdotal evidence pointing to blockbuster and other dead chains.  GME might be late to the party, but i don't see any other brick & mortar retailer in their market that is better positioned to make the transition.

Either way, I'm not impressed. The fact that you thought that would be impressive, by itself, is a little disheartening.

I'm not pretending to be in the game industry - that's not where I make my money. But, my original thesis is the same : **Gamestop was a shite company with no prospects until the recent overhaul of its executive team.**

> Aka, half of Amazon's business.

Oh yeah, thanks for reminding me. Amazon DOES do everything that Gamestop does, and is more convenient! You do realize that Gamestop's Ecom presence is bad for a multi-billion dollar company, right? Not only that, but Gamestop literally has ZERO value add.
 
Maybe if Gamestop did something new or disruptive, then it would be able to demand a tech multiple. But Gamestop, at this moment, is not a serious competitor to Valve, an actual tech company. It's a brick & mortar store, with an online store. **Would you ever argue that Bed Bath & Beyond should be priced like a tech stock?**

> Video games? Are you legitimately retarded. rabble rabble rabble hardware sales.

Obviously not.** Physical copies,** like I've said before, are a dying trend - No  one wants to lug them around, worry about scratching a disk, or letting them take up precious space.

Who gives a fuck about hardware sales - Amazon can do the same damn thing. Point being, there is literally zero reason for someone to pick Gamestop, they add zero value to the transaction. What? You're going to value them because their email list is big? You also going to discount them for the years and years of negative experiences they've been doling out for game returns?

>They're getting rid of unprofitable brick and mortar, not brick and mortar entirely, mongoloid.

Mongoloid? Because you strawmanned my statement? Tell me, genius, are they getting rid of brick & mortar stores? Yeah? Oh woowww.

> You do realize that Gamestop's Ecom presence is bad for a multi-billion dollar company, right?

It's actually not. Again, in comparison to other niche retailers in the ecommerce sector they're severely undervalued. You can keep spewing this tired shit but it doesn't make it true. Nobody is comparing them to Valve, we're comparing them to other niche retailers. 

> Who gives a fuck about hardware sales

Console manufacturers. In fact, it's the most important part of their business and drives everything they do. It's why when Sony developed RFID tech that would tether a copy of a game to a specific console, a system was worked in place to still allow Gamestop to alter it to a new console for a used game system to still exist. Because, get this, they reach the most profitable gaming demographic and other retailers don't. 

> You're going to value them because their email list is big?

What the fuck are you even talking about. This is about hybrid retail, Best Buy is crushing it with the model right now.

1236,GME,"In order to drive a stock price down, there must be a higher volume of sell orders than buy orders.  In this way, in order for the excess sell orders to be filled, they have to sell at a lower price.  With thousands of excess sell orders driving the stock price down bit by bit every second, over time a stock will depreciate in value.  This process works the other way with excess buy orders as well.  Hence when bullish sentiment (longs) is stronger than bearish sentiment (shorts), the excess demand for buy orders trumps the shorts.

To answer your question more directly: shorting drives a stock price down whenever the amount of sell orders trumps the amount of buy orders.  That’s why people on this sub want everyone to keep buying and buying - in order to preserve bullish sentiment and shoot GME to the moon.",0.041,0.902,0.057,0.3182

this is an IoT security company with a market cap of $7B. they could be taken private or purchased by any number of companies at a small premium short term. John Chen has certainly built and sold something before. long term, maybe Chenny boy 10x's this or moar. that's what i really want. any way, the upside is huge. You have solarwinds and symantec crumbling every day. others have said it before me: this is the decade of technology leaving our computers and entering our world in full force, just look at tesla. i doubt my kids will ever own a car, it'll just be a service, like so many other things.

if this story keeps evolving for the better, i'm aiming for a little over 9000 shares. mostly for vegeta, but also for kakarot.

Iv been burnt on this like most long BB people and we want nothing more than to see it succeed but, this may be a poor entry to the stock.

This is like standard finance stuff. Easy to make a story without showing underlying basics.

Comparing current EBITDA's to stock prices is never a good thing. You should always be forward looking and provide strong developments paths from the current EBITDA level. That path is worth something or not. Not only this year's EBITDA.

Also valuations do not equal prices. See TSLA

Point taken on selling shares to refinance debt. Not sure what the impact could / would be. On the other hand. Debt spreads are still low. There is a lot of collateral. And being financed with some debt is healthy, provides a tax shield and is cheaper than fully equity. No reason to fully refinance all to equity. 

God I fucking hate people who just say 'hacking' whenever something happens on their pc which they dont understand.

YES, by all means make a response video!!! Keep this ""war""going, but yes, do it to appeal to your target audience. You don't espouse the merits of big business for people coming in here looking to make ""a sure bet"" in the market. By all means, be civil and passionate about what we do here, but reign in the personal attacks. By proving that our side is the bigger one and the one that's more emboldened towards ""the little guy,"" that works wonders...

1568,TSLA,"1. Borrow rate isn't indicitive of short interest %. It's based on demand, rates jump up when there is large demand with respect to time. The greater the demand in the smaller amount of time, the higher the rates.
2. People are comparing the END OF CYCLE NUMBERS to the start of the cycle. Comparing December numbers where there was massive lockdown where retailers left and right are closing stores is going to hurt GME. No SHIT SHERLOCK. With the difficulty  in procuring any gaming hardware in general, just look at PC hardware or PS5/Xbox Series X, of course sales will be down in general. Most of their business ""AT THE MOMENT"" is still retail, they're not going to post gang buster numbers in December. Instead what we'll most likely see is a spread out increase in their earnings over several quarters as opposed to all front loaded as they normally are in the holiday season.
3. Their E-Commerce jumped 300% also same as 2. They are comparing literally end of cycle numbers, PANDEMIC lockdown, supply shortages and zero rev from Microsoft shared earnings are included in there. I thought the market is forward looking not backwards.
4. Hedge funds are WRONG ALL THE FUCKEN TIME just look at TSLA. Only time will tell how high GME will go but at this price point you are dead fucken wrong.

2021 started off as a clean 350-yard drive ripped right down the fairway, and today's little pullback is essentially the approach shot we shanked into the sand trap in front of the green. We can still save par, and we have 17 more holes to go. This metaphor is exhausted.

The charts look toppy because ELY has been setting new highs since December 1st, and it's STILL undervalued. If you were waiting for a dip for the last six weeks, it never came. If you were waiting for a dip from last week, you're still waiting. Get in and wait, don't wait to get in.

We keep moving the price by placing more buy orders that won’t be full-filled completely but will cause a demand spike and price to appreciate.

When people buy puts from a bank, the bank shorts shares for each contract so that if exercized it works out to 0. This is because they don’t want to end up investing in equities through contracts they sell exercising.

MOASS is fundamentally a broken market. Those only happen in the short term in response to very unexpected inputs.

A lot of the reasoning behind MOASS is that shares short > shares float. But that's not the right comparison. In reality, there are like 60m shares short, 50m shares float as ""True"" longs, and then 60m ""borrowed longs"", so it's 110m shares long, 60m shares short.  So in reality, you have 110m people to provide shares to 60m shorts to cover. As borrowed longs sell, in theory it could cause a share recall, but really, it just gets shifted around within brokers and between brokers and dealers and everyone else. They try REALLY hard to not force a short to cover with a buy-in.  It pisses people off. As those borrowed longs sell to shorts, you basically reduce the short leverage on the stock. If they sell to a new long, then it's basically a new true long, and some other long becomes a borrowed long. 

In terms of how it goes, as price goes up, and shares become more scarce raising borrow fees, you'll see covering, and maybe others taking a loss and entering short at a higher price. Hedge funds and other institutional traders will constantly look at this stuff and hedge as they go. Just like some value funds trimmed GME when it 8xed, you'll see short sellers also trim if their underwater short position has become too large. That means that while the short squeeze can happen and cause bid, it wont create the broken market context necessary for a MOASS 

My calculation is to replicate the VW situation you'd either need inflows of about 40 billion dollars in one day that limit-price-up the stock repeatedly and prevent execution to the point where everyone's risk management is going nuts (and then exiting sucks for you as a bagholder, who's going to buy those shares you bid at $150 the next day?), or you would need a new insider to surprise with an entry of a huge amount of call options or something and be locked up. Alternatively, short interest around 700 or 600% might start to risk it. All are highly unlikely/hard to do without being noticed. And many of these have a significant risk of the SEC stepping in, freezing all trading, and then GME doing the sane thing and issuing a ton of new shares, guaranteeing their survival and creating a growth window, and not burning the shorts. Remember - their objective, by law in fiduciary duty, and that includes RC now as a board member, is long term shareholder value, not fucking the shorts. Fucking the shorts can be fun for them, but it's a breach of their duty if it doesn't happen to also be in the direct line of maximizing long-term shareholder value.

For a real opinion on PLTR, there is a lot of threats coming up for this company that are holding it back.  There is a large number of shares set to come on to the market at the end of the month. Most of the new contracts have been relatively small. They may loose there big contract with the fed for covid tracking. That is the kind of news that might make people drop their shares as soon as they are available. All the news is sort of catalyzing around the lockup shares release and right now they arent leaning the right direction. 

I would construe this as big market manipulation.

So you can see from this ONE share, we have created 4 longs (A, C, E, G) and 3 shorts (B, D, F). Remember that the market cap is only 10 shares, so we now have 130% ownership (10 A, 1 C, 1 E, 1G) and 30% short interest (1 B, 1 D, 1 F).

What if the shorts now cover? F buys back from G at whatever value, then returns the share to E, then D buys back from E and returns to C, B buys back from C and returns to A, and now all 30% SI has been covered from ONE stock that's been traded repeatedly.

Now just imagine this example, but extrapolate it to many new levels, and that's how we arrive at 240% SI and them still being able to cover just fine.

2055,GME,"A hedge fund bet against the success of Gamestop (GME) back in the day when it was around 30$.  This is called shorting a stock.

Knocked the fuck out of the stock, year after year, brought it down to a 4$ stock as of June last year.

In practice this means that they're borrowing shares from brokers, and selling them at the current price (30$ back in day).

They hope that the price goes down so much that they can just buy the shares from the market for cheap and return them to the broker.

Today, GME is at 42$, driven by activist investors such as Ryan Cohen, and us retards.

The only way the hedge fund can return the shares now is by taking a loss over the price they purchased the stock at.

Now here comes the kicker. We're not in the mood to sell. So where are they going to buy the stocks from ?

This will lead to a feeding frenzy, where multiple hedge funds will try to buy shares quickly so that they can return them before the price goes up too much.

When that happens, the frenzy will cause the price to go up parabolically, and lead to what is called, a short squeeze.

The stock is estimated to squeeze to 100+ before the shorts start panicking.

When they panic, some say it might go as high as 1000.

This happened to VW back in the day too.

This is the game we're playing.

Of course I had no idea that there were taxes, or brokerage fees or anything like that.  So I immediately lost what little money I had and my ""advisor"" called me and said basically, ""you're an idiot (fair), you don't know what you're doing (also fair), and investing is best left to professionals.

So I dutifully funded my 401k over the years and amassed a healthy mutual fund portfolio on the side.

Year of the wuhan rolls around and like tons of you, I'm working from home and bored out of my mind most of the day.  I find WSB, I find RH, I learn about options trading, and I start making money.

Called my parents and told them about this new found entertainment, and shit you not, first thing out of my mom's mouth -- ""Remember what that lady told you about trying to day trade""

Over 20 fucking years ago.

Shit's changed mom and dad.  Enjoy your house and your beach house and retirement.  I've been bootstrapping my fucking way through life because ""just get a job and put money in your retirement fund"" isn't enough anymore",0.079,0.833,0.087,0.4445

2579,GME,"I was trying to do this same math an hour ago to calculate the short:float ratio, created a sheet too. I think it's more tricky than you describe.

The reason it's tricky is because shorters create a new synthetic long everytime they short the share. This synthetic long is added to the pool of ""float + synthetic float"" which shorters can borrow (or cover) from unless the owning account is a cash account.  


Thus the true public float is =  
 total outstanding shares - unavailable (insiders/instit, cash diamond hands) + synthetic longs on margin  


(BTW, your post says the true float is 14M and I think you're wrong. According to my data the true public float is in the negative! Aka all the shares being traded are all synthetics)  


I can't come up with a way to find out what the number of outstanding synthetic longs is, but it could be a very large number. Only when we know this number can we tell the exact short:float ratio.  


But even then, we still can't exactly measure what it means because as long as  the synthetic longs are circulated in margin accounts, the ""float+synthetic float"" pool can still grow bigger and shorters short more (assuming they have infinite money).  


With that said, the positive clue here is that when the ""float + synthetic float"" pool starts to become very small to the point there are no more shares to borrow, they run out of ammo. This is evidently already happening  as indicated by  the rising borrow rates for GME.",0.038,0.84,0.122,0.9451

On the other hand, you have a covered call. In this case you sell a call AND you own 100 shares. So in this scenario it still goes up to $60 but you only lost opportunity. You already own those shares so you sell them to the buyer of the contract for $15.",0.118,0.824,0.057,-0.4419

2803,BB,"Ok im fully retarded but Here’s what I have discovered about options by being on WSB with other retards the last couple years never learning anything about stocks anywhere else except some YouTube videos with stick figures.

I wouldn’t do this for anyone else but you seem especially retarded too so I want help

Basically a call option is a bet. Its saying “I think the stocks are going to go up over a certain price, and I am paying for the ability to buy the stock at the fixed price I’m betting on. In my case $12.5 or $14

If I win I get to sell my ability to buy stocks at the price I bet on (12.5 or 14) for much higher than I paid for the bet at the beginning 

So if the stock goes to $20, I can still buy 100 of them for $12.5 or $14 and then sell them immediately for $20 each. Or I can sell my winning bet to someone else who wants to do that. 

Hence why it’s called an option: the ability (option) to buy or sell at a fixed price.

I hope your smooth brain can comprehend this and you can get some tendies.

Since I have 12.5 calls at a later date, I’m hoping that the price will be way over 20 and I will make a lot of money with either the 14 or the 12.5. The 12.5 will be worth more because the gap between the current value will be higher than what I have to buy the stocks for 

I might be totally wrong about most of this but like I said I’m retarded

Yeah no shit. That's the whole point of their pivot to E-commerce. The gaming industry will be worth hundreds of billions in 5-10 years. All gamestop needs is 10% of a 500 billion dollar market and boom 50 billion dollar company.

3006,SF,"Great analysis and thanks for the insight into your line of work. 

1) Regarding point number 1, I live in an HCOL on the West Coast and my dreams of owning a home seemed reasonable a few years ago when a 1500-2000 sq foot starter home was about $600k. Now everything is about $1M+ and completely unaffordable for a millennial like me, who is a decently high earner. I do wonder where the housing market moves in 3-5 years from now for areas like LA, SF, Portland and Seattle. I imagine prices do drop somewhat as boomers pass and more supply hits the market, but that doesn't account for international investors in South Korea, Japan and China buying houses in Amerca. 

2) When I first read your post, I could not help but think about the distressed assets I could purchase; however, I realized most properties will be in Class C or lower areas where the entire economy is likely ravaged. Anyways, the people that will be foreclosed on are going to have a really hard time. I am glad they are getting relief for the time being, but we all know how markets work. On the other end, the government is at fault for the lockdowns so are those individuals guaranteed some type of protection? I'm not sure. If we let millions of people lose their homes and never return to old jobs due to automation or cost reductions, we will have an even bigger inequality issue and capitalism will barely hang on.

Is the issue with collateral (strategic default) borrower (normal default) or both? Have rising home prices provided significant enough cltv barriers to protect somewhat seasoned loans (2-3 years)?


Do you think inflation will impact or be impacted by this? My take is that we are likely lower for longer no matter what, even if the fed backstops all markets


If your answer to the above is yes, do you think we will see a buying opportunity for MSR assets (or already cheap banks) at a hella discount


Banks are holding higher allowances for loan losses under CECL, are they sufficient? Do the models work?


The housing market is especially hot in California and NYC, however the impacts from coronavirus are quite different than in other markets. Is this the problem area?


What percent of mortgage loan portfolios (1st, 2nd, Heloc) falls into this deferred/grace bucket at this point? Back maybe 6-8 months ago it was ~10%


What's your take on student loans? During 2008 the delinquency and charge off rates were relatively isolated from market volatility. Is the same going to happen now? And if so, is it due to again deferring the loans


Have you seen any indication of deferred/grace loans curing because of the deferral? There was a great study on HELOCS from the frb that showed people could often finance themselves through a recession if they had access to additional credit


What percent of deferred loans do you feel are savvy money managers vs people in trouble?

I was looking at RKT yesterday and was thinking about some of the same stuff. One interesting thing was that for loans held in their portfolio, they said that about .7% were delinquent and not in a forbearance agreement. I think they had like 5% in a forbearance agreement as well. The delinquincies were slightly up since the previous quarter, which really is one reservation I have on this. The other is whether those forbearance agreements transition to delinquincies, which I think is very likely without intervention. Either way, I'm stupidly long RKT right now.

The other thing I'm curious about is if the supply has been throttled by the varus. I feel like a lot of the people who would have been willing to sell at these prices, or lower, have held off due to the danger/hassle of selling a home in these times. That sentiment might go for buyers as well though, and I certainly don't see demand diminishing with near zero rates. Great post, refreshing to see something other than all the porn.

As I read every half-decent DD within the top 100 posts of GME, I do remember that random post with all this information that came from no-where... a lot of people were critical of the information they gave on the whole PE/IB analysis, and I think most threw it out since it was sourceless and some of the analysis seemed unlikely... so you are thinking that this mystery person was legit and that the behind-the-scenes workings of the shorts are presently in a scramble? All of the news related to the big MM's and hedge funds seem to indicate they're scrambling something fierce. It's also amazing how high us little retail investors are getting on GME right now -- the almost 1M shorts from today seemed to hardly make any dent at all


With all the history behind Left and Steven Cohen and Citron, I would guess they are all colluding with these short attacks and even sending their cronies to wsb to spread bearish bullshit TA propaganda. The question is, how long will they be able to hold out, will one of these big MM's backstab the others by covering and running, and will any additional catalysts break the ""composure"" (really, they're like chickens with their heads cut off right now) of MMs and send this thing flying... What are your thoughts on the timeline of this in regards to holding your call options?
