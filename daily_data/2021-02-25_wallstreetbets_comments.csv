Yep, if you look on just about any chart on any symbol. Most breakout bull bars with starting volume like we’ve had on the weekly chart is followed by a pullback, sometimes even 100% or more, but without any stopping volume the trend continues. Look at Tesla on weekly with volume, MRNA, etc, I mean literally almost any chart you can see starting volume, pullback we’re people are like, I told you so, and then trend continuation.

95,GME," Let's say you bought 10 shares at $300. Then GME crashed and went down to $50 a share. But since you have diamond hands, you didn't sell and bought another 20 shares at $50.


Your total investment is (10 * $300) + (20 * $50) = $3000 + $1000 = $4000.


Total number of stocks you have is 10 + 20 = 30.


Effectively you bought each share for $4000/30 = $133.3


Therefore, in effect you averaged down from $300 a share to $133 a share.

102,GME," Hey, I'm not going to give you any concrete numbers-based advice, because I don't think that's what you need, but I'll try to help anyways.

You need to do some math yourself and figure out what you are looking to make vs. what you are willing to lose. 

It sounds like from this post you are asking people to tell you when they are all going to sell, so that you can sell at the peak with them. I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but that is not going to happen. Not because anyone here is evil (I am so grateful for the GME tip), but simply because that's not how things work. If, somehow, everyone agreed to sell at $1000, people would sell at $999 to make sure they didn't get stuck. There's simply no way to get the sort of coordinated teamwork around your shares that you are hoping for.

So looking around to get a sense of price targets is good, but beyond that, it's up to **you** to decide what price you will be happy walking away.",FwdMomentum,273,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lro0p9/round_2_weve_refuelled_and_now_were_going_to_pluto/gomy2zc/,0.1,0.743,0.158,0.8992

105,GME," Lol you had me at the first half.

For what its worth, I **mostly** agree with you. 

I don't view diamond-handing as saying ""I want 5mil/share and won't sell for anything less"" (which would obviously be bad), but I view it more as sticking to your investment if something goes wrong or you pick a bad entry point. I've been holding GME since a little before the spike, was bagholding after it, and more than doubled my position in between spikes.

So if that is considered diamond-handing, I don't think that's bad. Past-me would've panic sold. But yeah, the type of diamond-handing I mentioned before (which is what I **think** you're getting at to) can definitely lead to some problems.",FwdMomentum,15,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lro0p9/round_2_weve_refuelled_and_now_were_going_to_pluto/gon8rak/,0.16,0.747,0.093,-0.9331

Edit: I have about an 8 months emergency fund, but I'm also gainfully employed. Hate thinking how putting all of that in at like $43 and even selling now, though I would have just sold to cover principal, would mean I could give a two weeks notice at end of this week, and use the gains to comfortably take that certification training I've been meaning to start and look for a better paying job. Hell even if I'd only out 1/3 to 1/2 of that into gme I could have done the same thing

186,GME," Story time (as I understand it): MM sells a bunch of $60 calls when the stock is at $40. The delta value is sitting at .6 when they do this, so they hedge these calls and buy 60 shares  around the $40 market price for each call they sold at $60 strike. As the price goes closer to $60, delta gets closer to 1 so they buy more shares at prices lower than $60 so they don’t lose their ass. As more MMs buy to cover their hedge, momentum picks up, buying intensifies and now you’re in a gamma squeeze where you have a ton of MMs buying to hedge their positions. Price blows past the strikes and now there is more buying at a loss. They will probably short the fuck out of this but given the attention GME has gotten, it’s gonna be harder for them to naked short sell and we are probably going to see the real squeeze.

208,GME," TBH no idea. You could kind of explain the last peak with the high GME short interest, even though in retrospect it looks a lot like bubble buying. I personally find it hard to navigate the data nowadays as it's a lot unclearer than a few weeks ago.

Some things are sure:

1) GME is a lot less shorted than in January
2) The majority of shareholders are institutions

What does this mean? Large shift in prices are not cause by retail investors or at least can't snowball as easily as a few weeks ago. 

What happened yesterday? Gamma squeeze. We have seen the same 3 times with GME in the recent past, once with the huge increase and then the large drop back down under the level before the GS. 
This seems very likely as a scenario again, as the increase was very drastic. I do not know what had to cover however.
Personally I think it is going to slowly correct itself downwards today and tomorrow again how ever, retail has experience in these shifts now so there will be less panic selling. This might mean that the overall price level will shift upwards in comparison to yesterday's open by a good deal.

To conclude: No fucking idea. It could be anything and it is a complete casino right now. If you want to invest, invest money you can lose. Don't buy because you think you are missing out. If you say that you want to gamble then go ahead and gamble.

213,GME," Some ETFs have to keep a certain portfolio allocation. If a certain stock spikes way high like GME did, the portfolio becomes unbalanced and they need to rebalance. In some cases this happens automatically. 

People like to say this is a big coordinated effort happening in the space of minutes, but it's just an automated process. It's already been part of the big sell offs in the last GME moonshot. 

In order for GME moonshots to not get sold down, these ETFs with automatic rebalancing would have to sell enough of their share inventory to the point that the volumes being sold aren't enough to push the price down. 

Basically don't expect a moonshot until those GME shares held by ETFs are drained out, until then it's just gonna go up and right back down.",yumcake,5,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ls8dka/they_are_selling_millions_of_shares_from_etfs/goq40p1/,0.023,0.889,0.087,0.714

He made tons of money through his entrepreneurial endeavors but lost next to all of it trying to be a day trader on Scottstrade in the few years before he died on an old af slow af computer ... smh. My mom got $40k from my bio dad in 1984 because he didn’t want anything to do with me and just gave her the lump sump (evidently her other option was “I know a lot of shady people so...”)... anyway. She took 20k and invested in blue chips and with the other 20k she started a used car sales business. Remember the timing here. 1984. There was a small crash in 1985, and my panicky-paper-handed grandpa made her sell IT ALL at almost total loss. Had she kept them, she’d be ... well, she is a millionaire from her business but goddamn she’d be insanely rich now had she JUST FUCKING DIAMOND HANDED!!!

I got too deep into history. Anyway. I’m not a total fuckup; I’m an attorney with a good job but I’ve always been terrible with money management. The ONE TIME my mom listened to my advice was this fucking stock. I think her average is ~200. And she only bought what she was prepared to lose. And thanks to my updates, she held through the dearth.

The next day my account was at $21,000. Mind you I literally just enabled options trading and this was my first stab at it. So of course, greed set in and I rode the wave and let it go until the next day. The next day market opens I was down to 11,000 from 21,000. I was such a retard that I hoped it would bounce back. Long story short, my options expired way the fuck out of the money and I made a total of -$1000 on that ride.

347,GME," A call can be purchased for a set amount that gives you the ability or option to purchase 100 shares at the set price. This autist bought two calls one at a $60 mark and one at $73. Both of these calls expire on Friday so if the price of gamestop were below what he paid for the calls and the strike price of the call they would expire worthless. Seeing how GME had been hovering in the 40-50 range it was very unlikely these calls were not going to expire and the ape would have been out the money paid for the calls. 

As I write this GME is currently trading at $166 a share. This idiot can buy 100 shares for 60 and 100 share for $73 which right now would be worth around 20k. That's assuming the price doesn't change between now and opening of the market tomorrow when they can sell or hold and hope for higher.

348,GME," No worries dude. 

The basics are that options are in increments of 100 shares. You can buy call options, which give you the right but not the obligation to purchase 100 shares at a specific price by a specific date. You can buy puts which give you the right but not the obligation to sell 100 shares at a specific price by a specific date. 

Then there’s selling buys and selling puts but I don’t mess with that so I’m not the one to explain it. 

Options contracts value changes due to a handful of variables including but not limited to (implied volatility, time decay, price of the stock, etc). 

Essentially in my position, I’d purchased a call option for GME for the strike price of $99 expiring tomorrow. The cost of the option was $1 per share so it cost me $100. It was so cheap because the odds of GME hitting $99 was pretty low, and the value of that option went way up by the price of GME surpassing $99 but also by it doing it in such a short time as that increases its implied volatility. 

When it got to a value of $3 (so $300) I sold my contract because I was taking profits but in hindsight 12 minutes later the value was well over $2,000. 

Lots of good resources to check out as I’m not an expert, but the rule of thumb is generally that if you decide to get into options you should know that you’ll lose a lot of money in the learning process, but that you can potentially make a decent amount of money if you make some smart bets. It’s a very risky side of trading stocks and the majority of people get burned so just make sure you inform yourself to the best of your ability. Also optionsprofitcalculator.com is a good resource.",mavrathion,7,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lrnc62/oh_my_god_im_going_to_fucking_pass_out/gon5fda/,0.059,0.774,0.167,0.9903

357,GME," An 'option' (a call or put) is a contract giving you the right (not the obligation) to buy (call) 100 shares at a given price. In this case, he has the right to buy shares for $800.07 per share ($80,007 for the pack of 100). If that sounds high, it is. The more unlikely the share price, the cheaper the option is. How much did this option cost him? $0.07 x100, or $7.

He can either excersise the contract and buy at that price, or let it expire unclaimed and lose the $7 he spent.

Or there's the third choice- instead of using the contract himself, he can sell the rights to someone else. Well, GME just skyrocketed and the $800 share price is a lot more likely than it was before, so the price of the contract has also jumped to $1.19 x100, or $119. He could sell it to someone else and make $112 profit and he never even owned any shares of GME.

Also note, he has 34 of these calls, all identical. So he's made $112 x34 = $3,808 today if he sells. But he can keep holding and see the price go even higher.

449,GME," Hello Fellow Retards!

If you want to know what is causing this GME stock price soar and why you should be getting in you are in the right place.

**‘Gamma squeeze’** :

The options buying can, under certain circumstances, create conditions in which a price rally feeds on itself. Known as a “gamma squeeze,” this occurs when the sellers of the call options, in order to hedge their positions, buy the underlying stock. As the price of the stock rises, they need to buy more to maintain their hedge, creating the feedback loop.

648,AI," While I believe the mechanics of it are possible, there is one problem the AI can’t predict. And that’s the SEC halting it. I promise you they will not allow this to get that high. I can see 1k-3k per share, but after that I’m betting they cut this off and use the market manipulation BS response as to why. This isn’t a shill or bot comment. I just realized during the hearing that even catching Vlad in a lie while under oath, and nobody saying a damn word, that it’s all a sham. No one cares but us that he lied. It’s all for show. Until I see Vlad, market makers, or someone from the DTCC in jail, I won’t trust our government/sec to do anything at all for us retail investors. You think robinhood is the only one that can pull the plugs??? Oh no retards, there are plenty of people who could shut this down before it even gets started. You may be asking yourself why would they? They’re going to use the whole “protecting the greater market from manipulation” horse shit. Saying we could cause a stock market crash. Which technically we could. But you know what? **Im not selling**.

**IM NOT FUCKING SELLING!!**

You’re going to have to shut this whole MF down before I give you back my shares!! Money be damned! It’s the principle of the matter now. I was in this for a nice fat gain at first. Yeah I held all the way from the bottom to the top and back down to the bottom and halfway up again. The squeeze has not been squoze. And changing the rules in the middle of a game is bullshit.

All that  to say this, been saying it the last few weeks. It is the most important thing I can tell you if you believe in this short squeeze.

High volume days & they will break. If the buying demand is there, it’s a wrap & matter of time thing.

I like the stock & DFV hit the nail on the head of GameStop’s potential when  great leadership steps in.

You’re understanding correctly. 

Generally, the closer you get to expiration date and the farther you get in the money, the closer the options premium for will approach ( actual stock price - option strike price).

I see that GME closed at 91, and that the 3 dollar strike options for Friday closed at a cost of 88 dollars, which reflects that. You’re paying 88 dollars a share to buy it for 3 dollars... meaning 91 dollars.

That’s why when you get lucky with deep OTM options bought for pennies that go ITM and approach that.

First runup of GME I had contracts at strikes 14, 16, and 30. I set limit sells at 286, 284, and 270 so they would all sell at GME price 300.

874,GME," Fair question. 

Chances are, they won’t - which is why a contract for 250c that expires soon is **very** likely to expire worthless.

It may go up in value from when it was bought, however. The thing is that if it is very unlikely that the stock will hit 250 or greater when the stock is sitting at 20-40, then it becomes slightly more likely when the stock suddenly goes to 180 IE more than half the way.

See my last comment in my history explaining IV, but the option gained a little bit in potential value.

Options are betting on direction and chance of change. GME going up raises IV and chance of hitting that strike, so the contract will go up but keep in mind if we’re talking about a Friday contract it will also lose value every day as it gets closer to expiry.

This is why the most profitable options tend to be wildly OTM calls that expire soon. 99% of these contracts will always expire worthless, so they’re worth almost nothing. I call them scratch offs. 

If I bought a 300c that expires this Friday this morning, I’m gambling. If GME goes up at all it’s value will dramatically rise mostly becuase it was so close to worthless already.

.... god I wish I had lol. You’ve seen a few of these posts today, people turning 500 into 10K. That’s becuase the options they bought went from being borderline impossible to be in the money to actually remotely viable - that’s a huge increase in value.",whateverathrowaway00,11,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lrt82s/20000_gain_on_one_59_cent_option_lol_65_into_12k/goopj45/,0.051,0.776,0.172,0.9851

877,GME," Just know that you're going to get majorly fucked by implied volatility if you buy after big spikes like this. These massive gains only happen when you buy after a stock has been relatively flat for awhile and options prices are lower, then the stock has a gigantic move out of nowhere.

884,BB," Exactly correct, yes. 

And ugh right - I was debating buying some 800c weeklies for shits and giggles but I try not to buy short term options. 

I also have been saying I’d buy BB 20c leaps for a week and almost pulled the trigger this morning but ofc I didn’t. Oh wellllll, lol.

To your point about volatility: think about it like this.

What makes an options contract valuable? IE what are you buying?

It’s the chance that price may fluctuate, causing your option to buy to be worth more.

IV, or Implied Volatility is an attempt to mathematically model how likely a stock is to dramatically change.

Think of it this way, we have two stocks both worth 5 dollars:

Stock A has been 5 dollars for four years, no changes.

Stock B has been five dollars for a day. Last week it was 40 dollars, the week before it was 1 dollar, the week before it was let’s say 60. You get the point it’s crazy **volatile**


If someone asked you how much you’d bet that the stock WOULDNT be 6 dollars by Friday, you’d probably bet a ton of money against stock A being 6, but be pretty scared to bet anything against stock B, right?

That’s IV. It’s the factor that feeds the model used to price options ( Black-Sholes iirc)

So, in this scenario, slightly OTM options at 6 dollars for stock A would be ridiculously cheap since very little chance of them ever being ITM. Stock B, much like GME would be very expensive even one dollar above stock price.

For an example, go look at TAK and what it’s IV is (30%) and option prices at 20c.

Compare those to BB (IV 140%ish), and it’s premium prices at 14 and note how much more expensive they are.


This is also why the craziest gains happen when a stock without much volatility suddenly becomes volatile. All options go up in value suddenly.",whateverathrowaway00,28,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lrt82s/20000_gain_on_one_59_cent_option_lol_65_into_12k/goop1jp/,0.052,0.837,0.111,0.9649

HALTS- they happen every day on plenty of stocks that have high volatility and price spikes. It’s normal so don’t let it scare you. Halts usually last for 5 min sometimes longer so keep an eye on what happens next. Selling because of halts can screw you out of massive gains.

ROBINHOOD- doesn’t choose when to halt trading. The SEC/NASDAQ does that. RH can restrict trading like they did in January but they CANNOT halt trading.

But once it goes past 800 and the call options held on them are filled, there’s no stopping the rocket unless some seriously illegal crap happens.

[THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE]

If you have been following GME for weeks it surges at open, then the shorts borrow shares to short it down almost immediately and into the next couple hours, typically hitting a low around 11-11:30AM. This has happened pretty much every day. Yesterday they borrowed millions of shares to short, when sometimes it's just 100,000 at a time and haven't used them yet. Today will not be a normal day but they still have those shorted shares to deploy.

It seems prudent to wait for a dip and not buy immediately at open.",throwawaylurker012,248,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ls63oa/gme_megathread_for_thursday_february_25th_2021/gop8fll/,0.015,0.906,0.079,0.6757

1174,GME," Options gain value when things are very volatile, even if the price is moving in a direction that would normally make them decrease in value.

The market doesn't quite know what to make of GME rocketing this hard, so it considers the stock extremely volatile. This makes options prices skyrocket, since anything is possible.

It makes sense if you think about it. Options are more valuable the more likely their strike price is to be hit. In low volatility times, an option that's slightly out of the money is very unlikely to be hit, so the price is low, in high volatility times, with the stock swinging all over the place, there's a much higher chance that an out of the money option gets hit, so it's more valuable.

TLDR: Don't buy options when IV is high, as things settle down, you will get IV crushed, instead just buy shares if you think the price is going up, or short the stock if you think it's going down.",raltyinferno,23,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lrrstd/the_comeback/goo4tff/,0.056,0.839,0.105,0.8727

1206,GME," Bloody ""stake"" gave us a market update saying ""

In light of today’s activity in GameStop (GME), we are notifying our traders to be prepared for another volatile end to the week in certain symbols. While GME has seen the greatest market moves, showing over a 150% increase during normal and after-hours trading sessions on greater than 2 times volume, other symbols, such as Tilray (TLRY) are showing signs of increased activity on large volume and could experience significant moves in each direction, as well.
We ask that customers please prepare by reading the implications this increased demand may have on order executions within the trading ecosystem.

Trading Halts

With an uptick in volatility surrounding names like GameStop ($GME) and Tilray ($TLRY) several exchange-mandated trading halts may occur to these stocks.
This may occur due to the following:

A 20% movement inside the first 15 minutes or last 25 minutes of the session within a 5 minute period.

A 10% movement between these times within a 5 minute period. It is not uncommon for stocks to gap across price ranges, especially between market close and the following market open.

Each halt lasts for 5 minutes. More information can be found here.

What Happens to Order During Halts

An order placed before a trading halt may be held and executed once trading recommences.
An order for a full share placed during a trading halt could be executed once trading recommences. Orders for fractional shares can be subject to rejection by the exchange and need to be placed again once trading recommences.
For more information on circuit breakers read here.

Manage your risk during volatility

Such volatility can bring some particular risks to investors. We have prepared the following piece, to bring your attention to ‘gap risk’ and ‘liquidity risk’, two factors to consider while managing your portfolio during such periods.",omahabeachwallstreet,7,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lrzm73/me_holding_no_gme_shares_getting_ready_for_short/goopsi9/,0.038,0.862,0.101,0.9442

Hypothetically, people are leaving Robinhood in mass, which is forcing RH's clearinghouse to replace those shares that were lent out to shortsellers. So that's been forcing stock buy backs.

2nd, the Fedline was down today. Keeping short sellers from being able to cover short positions. 

3rd. Liquidity on GME has been super low. Almost all trades are happening outside of the public pool. Half of all sales have been short sales. Maybe some of these short sellers gave up. People had time to collect a few paychecks and keep buying stock. Volume today was 250% of normal. Another 120% of daily volume came in after hours.

1310,REAL," The change comes depending on how you spend your tendies. Buy what you like, but keep in mind that the more local you spend and everyone around you spends, the easier, better, and stronger the local standard of living becomes. Do you feel a company screws people over or uses slave labor or commits human rights violations or genocide? Then don't spend money with them if you can help it. It's not them that are doing this to us. We are doing it to ourselves by the way we chose to live and how we spend our money. You don't have to wait for everyone else to figure it out. Spend mega tendies in your local market and buy stuff from companies doing things you think are good for the earth, you, your whatever you think is important. We are the great equalizers that have risen up. If you want real change, it happens depending on how you spend your money, and how many Tendies you can Take from the HEDGIES!!! 

As a bonus. I do stress that this moment where the new blood overthrows the old guard? It's happened many times before. The reason it doesn't stick is because once we get all the tendies, we start losing the appreciation of being humble and start getting that rich mindset identity. By the next generation, it's gone. We need to keep in mind that money isn't for the hoarding. We already see big problems with the system we have. If we become the 1% of the 1%, will the overall picture of the world be any different? If we learn how to do REAL DD and spread investment funds into securing good companies and taking from hedgies, then we don't have to beg some shitty politician who's not listening to a word we say anyway.

That is what cramer means with ""that is the charge of fraud"". This proves market manipulation and collusion.

1347,GME," I mean, looking at it from his perspective, a less insidious explanation could be that he thought it really was incredibly overpriced and people would get burned buying at $300 plus. I watched him say *for 2 days straight* that it was time to ""ring the register"" and get out of GME because the squeeze wouldn't last before it gave up the ghost. That wasn't bad advice. If you sold at 250 when he first said it, you probably made bank. If you sold at 350 when he said it again, you definitely made bank. If you bought it instead, caught up in the hype train, you probably lost money. 

And I'm not judging anyone who decided to buy GME for the sole purpose of fucking over hedge funds. I did it, and I'm still holding. Or for getting caught up in the hype. But it seems to me that people forget Cramer is just trying to talk to normal people. For us autists, losing our life savings is a monthly, if not weekly, occurrence. Contained within the sub, that's a neat little community that people can write off as mildly concerning eccentrics.  But when literally every famous celebrity, YouTube personality, Instagram star, and professional athlete is saying buy/hold, as hilarious as it might be for us, is antithetical to someone who is meant to give cogent financial advice. 

The stock would've gone a bit higher if not for robinhood halting buys, but regardless, the odds of us getting out at the top wouldn't have been any better. Look at how many people are still holding. Diamond hands are great, but we aren't putting our retirement savings into it, expecting to get rich. We already expected to lose everything. Cramer wasn't every really talking to us, he was talking to the people who thought they had found the money printer and were unknowingly running full speed over a cliff.",AmbroseMalachai,193,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ls84js/even_cnbc_is_now_reporting_that_melvin_and_vlad/goq6vow/,0.03,0.888,0.082,0.9597

1349,AIG," No, they don’t. P&C Insurance companies aren’t sitting on liquid capital in the trillions of dollars (at least no single company).  Further, nobody is writing policies with limits in the trillions.  I work in mergers and acquisitions for one of the largest insurance companies in the world and have 20+ years of insurance experience. As such, I’ve got a pretty good idea of how much capital is held and where.  Nobody can pay out in the trillions. Hell, AIG was one of the largest companies of all time and they couldn’t handle a lesser amount during the housing crash.  Yes, the government bailed them out, but they were under no legal obligation to do so.  They did it because, at the time, AIG was structurally important to the entire financial system (a SIFI) and letting it fail would have created a runaway chain reaction in the economy.  That’s entirely different than one hedge fund. 

Secondly, insurance companies go insolvent all the time. Google Demotech failures and you’ll see what I mean.  When that happens state DOIs usually take the company over and put them in conservatorship and hope that they have enough reserve capital to pay claims. Sometimes they don’t and those claims have to be settled at lower amounts.

There are some things (like TRIA) where there is some government backing if the shit hits the fan, but very few loss types meet that bill. It’s why insurance companies have exclusions for certain broad disasters like war, volcanic eruption, nuclear issues, etc. Those losses would be so large that nobody could ever hope to cover them...because they’d run into the trillions.",rags2rooster,5,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ls84js/even_cnbc_is_now_reporting_that_melvin_and_vlad/goq1nr4/,0.135,0.761,0.104,-0.9427
1350,CHI," Can confirm. Most people don't understand you can get the best mortgage rate for your house or auto loan for a new car from Statefarm... They are financial institutions at this point.

Insurance companies are required by law to be able to cover who they insure. I believe it goes back to the Great Chicago Fire when they _weren't_ required to have the capital to pay out all of their customers, and when a local insurance company who mostly operated in CHI had to payout essentially every single client.

1488,GME," I bought 20 $30 puts expiring in March for $5 after the last squeeze. IV crush took those down to $1. I decided rather than lost $10k, I would sell 20 $28 puts for $.90 and claw back some inevitable losses. So I sold those today.

Then a couple hours later you know what happened. IV exploded and those $30 puts are worth $15 now, even though they're super OTM. So instead of being down $10k, I'm up $15 - $20k now, right? Wrong! The puts I sold also exploded in IV, so those went from netting me shy of $2k to being down $18k. The bottom line is I'm not locked into my $2 put spread.

I missed $15k - $20k in gains by trying to claw back $2k an hour earlier. fml but I live for this shit.

I also bought a $20 LEAP call at $50 before this exploded, so I'm not terribly upset given that's trading around $15k profit now and probably more tomorrow. So hopefully I can cover my losses and then some.

Options are great. I made $140k on the first GME squeeze and was not expecting this at all, though it could be the real deal. I jumped back in today after watching the price movement for 5 minutes. It took me back to January, looked exactly the same with no resistance on the way up. So I'm thinking it's short covering.

Greedy hedgefund assholes who tried to short from $30 and got destroyed, then shorted from $400 after the first squeeze up and didn't close down at $40 where we've been trading. So while they aren't underwater yet, they've probably lost half their profits before the close today on their current shorts.

Edit: In other words, if this spikes above say 250 tomorrow, Imma dump the stocks I piled on around 80, then if it goes above say 400 at any time, gonna start selling shorts .. sure it might spikes to 1k whatever, just gotta wait it out eating the minimal daily interest charge .. and the reason mostly is that short-selling mostly only requires timing it right once, i.e. when u catch it beyond your 'shits-gone-wild' threshold .. then you wait out and can cover in peace .. contrast this to yoloing going up .. you buy when low in the hope it spikes, then still stand risk of not being able to babysit the charts and missing the dump and becoming bagholders .. aint nobody got no time for that",no-more-throws,7,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lrpcc4/well_fuck/goo72tx/,0.072,0.818,0.11,0.8523

Entered at $250 like an autist 🦍, doubled down at $150 and tripled down at $50. GME needs to reach $42069 before I even begin thinking about selling.

Paper handed bitches, stop asking what are our sell prices or if we got an exit strategy.

**I don't even know how to sell, let alone have an exit strategy. My only strategy is to buy the dip. What I do know though, is that not even RobinFuckingHood is gonna be able to stop the rocket ship we're on.**

When I first joined a decade ago, reddit didn't even have thumbnail images. The posts on the front page were nothing but text and upvote/downvote buttons. When the admins proposed adding thumbnail images to posts on the front page, there was great controversy. Some worried that it would result in a degradation of post quality, but most of us thought that was silly.

WE WERE SO WRONG. :(",OmicronNine,8,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lrnn1p/100_gain_this_rocket_is_taking_off/gong1t3/,0.214,0.712,0.074,-0.9403
1608,ALL," Well... when a person or institution thinks a companies share price will drop in the near future, they place a “bet” called a “short sell”. Which is when they “borrow” a share position (whether they exist or not, it would seem, hence all the “naked shorting” terms you might have seen flying around) from a market maker. Once the price drops as they expect it to, they then buy the “borrowed” amount of shares at a cheaper price, return it to the market maker and the difference in price is their profits.
Now.... as an institutional trader (who has no restrictions placed upon them, unlike us mere retail traders) hears all these plonkers who are up mad amounts now only have the option to sell (coz robinhood etc set a period where that’s all we could do) some will.. price drops.. institutional greedy cunts know the sails have lost their wind and bet HEAVILY that the price is about to fall. Which it did. Because “short selling” also puts downward pressure on the price.

Unfortunately though for those greedy wankers, when they doubled down on the way down. A lot of stubborn apes (god bless you) didn’t sell and instead bought more like brain damaged Demi gods.

And now... it’s about to happen ALL OVER AGAIN.

Price going up. “Short selling” positions get scared. Buy shares to return to market makers which accelerates the fuck out of the price increase (especially when they’ve most likely doubled down even harder than before thinking this would all go away) which it hasn’t. And it isn’t going to. Because everyone bought more. And still aren’t selling. Because the SELL button exists only on the moon.

TLDR: Short positions that opened during the decline of the first wave are now being pressured into closing as “sell walls” are being broken down. 

HOLD. BUY with spare money. See you on Nibiru for shots of our own piss.

The article talks about how this guy, Rashiq Zahid, created a website to determine if any ice cream machine in ANY McDolands is down or not working. Rashiq is also on twitter:

If you dont take risks, you'll just be where you are now...you need to take risks to make change, its simple but true

Or you can wait and FOMO in when you see it do another massive run, up to you 🤦‍♂️

I suggest you buy shares. Options are not worth it right now unless you gamble with FDs. Check optionsprofitcalculator.com, you barely make anything more than just holding shares.

Good luck boys, see you on the moon.🚀🚀🚀🥵🥵🥵

Check the CNBC post, they lost 16 billion, and they are going to lose it again...short squeeze again lmao. They dont learn. Let's keep taking them to school.

(9:51AM): THEY ARE SHORTING $GME VIA 63(!) DIFFERENT ETFS** 

 (10AM): 0 SHORTS AVAILABLE FOR $GME RIGHT NOW. THEY BORROWED OVER 2,100,000 SHARES TO SHORT FOR YESTERDAY AND TODAY! (https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme; https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME) 


Also: They borrowed 1,500,000 $GME Shares to short yesterday (https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME), but there was no huge drop off or sell volume that would indicate, that they already shorted those. That means, they are now using those shorts as well as the ETFs.

The year is 2011, everyone and their mother has been foreclosed on, 401ks wiped out, and the banks got bailed out. You hear about a movement that is protesting the bank bailouts. You decide to go check it out. You normally don't go to protests but what's going on sits wrong with you. You arrive and look up at the ivory towers of finance. What do you see? Bankers drinking champagne while pointing and laughing at you.

I wake up in my GameStop-branded bed and pull back the curtains to another beautiful day. The surface of the moon is sparkling with the glistening glow of fresh tendies that rained overnight.

 

I turn on the TV to check the value of the GMED (GameStop Dollar, the new global currency after the Great Squeeze of 2021) and find it has risen 1% overnight -- $12055 per share, not bad. The ongoing court case against the market manipulators looks like it will soon resolve in our favour; it's frustrating it has taken this long, but nobody said justice was quick.

 

After finishing a delicious bowl of Nintendo Cereal System, which was brought back into GameStop shelves in 2029 to celebrate its 40th anniversary, I put on my shoes and coat to head to work.

 

As I open my garage, I am greeted by my Lambo, custom plate ""GME21"", its yellow paint glimmering in the light. No matter how many times I sit behind the wheel of this beautiful machine, it somehow never gets old. I hope it never does.

 

Feeling in a particularly good mood, I am driven to work with the power of Blackberry's latest EV technology along the freshly constructed moon highway to the sea of tranquility, where my workplace, GameStop MegaTower #4 is located. After their market cap reached $1 trillion, it didn't take long for GameStop to expand into every industry imaginable -- and some that were even beyond our imagination.

 

After a fulfilling morning trading $GME and GMED on the integalactic market, I decide to take the hyperloop to my favourite lunar restaurant for lunch. Andrew Left takes my order, looking a little dishevelled but otherwise relieved to have found a job somewhere to help pay off his debts. I exchange 0.00019 $GME for a plate of tendies with ketchup. It was delicious.

 

I decide to take the afternoon off from work, as working is not a necessity for those who had diamond hands pre-squeeze. I stop off at GameStop on the way home to pick up the PS6 Slim and Nintendo Switch 2 XL, which I look forward to playing in the evening.

 

As I sit in my living room enjoying my games, I sit back and wonder how life would have been so much different if I hadn't held with diamond hands. Through dips and spikes. What WallStreetBets and the internet community managed to pull off was the greatest wealth transfer in history, and life was never the same again. I shudder at the thought of a world where I had taken profits at $1,000 -- I would have enjoyed a nice holiday, sure, but those pleasures come-and-go. Only by holding were we able to change the world forever, to change the world into a fairer and brighter place.

1) We are still up huge from the close of yesterday and have seen a solid ground at the 140 range. This establishes a floor, i.e. the minimum amount of money the stock can go if paper hands sell.
2) I have read multiple articles claiming that Short Sellers just on Wednesday lost a total of 818 million. Why is this important you may ask?? Well simply put for you fellow atuists, with these HF down nearly a billion in one day, they can't continue the squeeze because they have no capital to buy the calls back. So this might leave us with no large increases until Monday until capital can be raised to cover. 
3) We know from the past, that without capital A) there can't be any short latter attacks B) the HF will be forced to pay high interest on these positions if they don't cover them. C) there will be a continuation of a squeeze if we hold.

4) Other shorted stocks have a good chance at rising too. Rember GME is the big whale while other shorts like AMC, NOK, and BB are more like fishes (still valuable but not like the whale). So while HF gathers capital to cover shorts on GME, they will have to pay BIG BIG BIG bucks on interest with the other smaller stocks.

2181,DD," # Remember the DD.

The price is easy to play with for those with the money to do so (see yesterday's spike to $350 when someone bought 255@350). The **VOLUME** is the telltale sign that things are going the way we want them to. Low volume? Price drops. Volume goes up? Price rises. We've bought up so many borrowed shares that every time they buy back any of them, the price rises. We aren't selling (the vast majority of us are holding).

They'll drag this out for as long as they can, but they longer they delay the inevitable, the higher the rocket will go. People sowing seeds of doubt are probably buying puts and profiting off of your loses. Let me repeat:

**There are people in this thread making money off of your losses.**

**They spread FUD so you sell and they can take the profit.**

In short, volume is more important than price (otherwise we wouldn't be in this wonderful little rise), and when you sell, you're lining someone else's pockets at a loss.

2185,EDIT," If we close over $150, it's a win. Fuck it, if we close anywhere higher than yesterday it's a win. Over $150 would be a win with a bonus point, for any of you eurotards who follow Rugby Union. For those who don't, it's a good thing. That's all you need to know.

As this squeeze develops, you're going to see a lot of two things. You're going to see a lot of negativity from genuine cardboard hands. Not paper hands, not folks who are about to fold, but newcomers who have yet to experience the full rollercoaster of a stonk cycle and therefore get jittery at the first hint of any kind of drop.

You're also going to see a lot of negativity from shills, bots, shorts, trolls, and any number of malicious actors you can imagine. These people have a vested interest in seeing this fall apart (to use another rugby analogy, these are the fuckers who collapse the scum repeatedly until the referee just awards a penalty and moves on) and will push out as much negativity as they can in order to trick people, particularly those in the aforementioned newer group who have less pre-existing immunity to such tactics, that the party is ending and they need to sell in order to not end up still on the dancefloor once the lights come up.

Now I'm not here to tell you that the only possible way this can go is up. Nor am I here to predict how this *will* go. I will leave that in the hands of other far more seasoned folks with diamond balls thousands of carats bigger than my own.

What I *am* here to tell you is that, an increase day-on-day is a win. After a surge like yesterday's, a *breakeven* day-on-day is a win. Hell, even if it were to close a small amount below yesterday's close, it wouldn't necessarily be anything more than a minor setback.

The point is though, it's the day-on-day closing price which ultimately matters here. Just because it goes up and down during the day, doesn't mean that every single rise and every single fall is a defining moment. We're talking about *trends*. At the end of the day, one has to look at the fluctuations over the entire day in order to build a picture of where we are - and ultimately, if the stock closes higher than it did yesterday, that's a win for us. Even if a stock was at $100 and only closed one dollar higher at $101, that is still a win - even if for a few glorious hours it jumped ahead to $110 or $120 in the afternoon. A brief rise and fall is an indication of literally nothing at all. These fluctuations are as natural to stonks as periods of wet and dry are to a storm system, or periods of being ahead and being behind are to the score in a football game. What matters is what the score is when the final whistle blows, and today, at this moment, we're up **33%**. That's fucking *huge*. Just because we were up by twice that earlier today, doesn't take away from the fact that our favourite stonk has climbed by a third over the course of the day.

Do *not* let the individual ups and downs of a trading day get the better of you. Do not let them blind you to the bigger picture. Our trend here is fucking beautiful, and if we don't close at the highest peak we've had over the course of the day, fuck it. That's what tomorrow is for.

Hold.

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

&#x200B;

So over a month ago, GME only had options for strikes below $40. When it first rallied from 19 to 40+.

When GME mooned, hedge funds bought GME puts for $40 because it was the highest available strike. They bet that they could ride out this squeeze and accept a maximum price of $40 per share that they shorted.

When GME dipped below $40, all of these put holders started to exercise the contracts so that they could hold the shares to exit their short positions.

My guess is that when GME crossed 40, these guys sold puts at various strikes in the 30s. Because they knew that they would have to buy even more shares to exit their previous short positions.

They're not exiting the position while fucking over anyone who bought those puts.

Once they close those puts, they can return their shares and let retail FOMO into this railly while hedge funds try to time the top of this rally and short it back down to earth.  


TLDR; Hedge funds exiting short positions, but trying to KANG gang this shit.

IB shows that until around 2pm, they could locate 1.7 - 2.1M shares (fluctuating)   Then it dropped FAST down to 700k at 2:30, 450k at 3:00, and down to 300k by 5pm, where it stayed  through AH.  Also the borrow cost is not crazy high (a little over 0.7%)

I have no clue what caused the buying frenzy but if it was a short squeeze, shortable shares should have been being returned to inventory, not coming out.  If anything, short sellers seemed to provide significant liquidity and prevent it from spiking even faster.

I happened upon the GME Story in the news, and while I was spiritually akin, I'm unemployed and money is tight. But when he came to me with the same interest, I loaned him a bit and he bought in somewhere around $300. Just a few shares. Then it dropped to around $100 - so I pumped in an equal number of shares in the hopes that it would soften the hit perhaps.

We've watched it sporadically, he more than I. When this recent surge started he let me know. We've been texting on and off this morning. He told me that it was going to be a ride and not to get too caught up. Here's the text I sent him back...

""As we \[his mother and I\] told you, we consider that money gone. So the ride doesn't affect me emotionally other than I want to see those fuckers lose everything. If I make $1, or hell if I lose it all, it would be well worth the ride. Fuckers""

If you dont take risks, you'll just be where you are now...you need to take risks to make change, its simple but true

Or you can wait and FOMO in when you see it do another massive run, up to you 🤦‍♂️

I suggest you buy shares. Options are not worth it right now unless you gamble with FDs. Check optionsprofitcalculator.com, you barely make anything more than just holding shares.

Good luck boys, see you on the moon.🚀🚀🚀🥵🥵🥵

Full Credit to u/HeyItsPixeL one of the best DDs I’ve ever read 

(9:51AM): THEY ARE SHORTING $GME VIA 63(!) DIFFERENT ETFS** 

 (10AM): 0 SHORTS AVAILABLE FOR $GME RIGHT NOW. THEY BORROWED OVER 2,100,000 SHARES TO SHORT FOR YESTERDAY AND TODAY! (https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme; https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME) 


Also: They borrowed 1,500,000 $GME Shares to short yesterday (https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME), but there was no huge drop off or sell volume that would indicate, that they already shorted those. That means, they are now using those shorts as well as the ETFs. 


TL;DR: Millions of shares being sold short today, trying to get people to panic sell. DATA IS FROM 9:45AM.

Except instead of putting in $450, 2 days of work, they put in savings, took away from mortgages and tuition. People bet their lives on this because they saw people posting about how GME will go to the moon, then all the bullshit happened and it tanked.

I'm holding because I've ""technically"" already made my money back by just going to work, I've put more money into shit I don't use/play like Clash of Clans, a VR headset so I'm not fussed if I end up losing that money. But if I was dumb enough to put the money I needed to buy a car, keep my house, feed my kids? Then of course I'd take back what I could, getting $6k back from your $8-10k invested sucks ass, but at least you have $6k to feed yourself and make payments.

But that's the rule they didn't follow, only invest what you can afford to lose, people got swept up by the hype and promise of infinite gains, everything made sense and they'd be rich or at least have a few thousand extra to go home with.

2861,TV," Just a reminder of who this asshole is:

Jon Stewart played several video clips from 2006 where Cramer discussed the spreading of false rumors to drive down stock prices and encouraged short-selling by hedge funds as a means to generate returns. At one point in a clip from December 22, 2006, he said, ""I would encourage anyone in a hedge fund to do it."" He called it a very quick way to make money and very satisfying. He continued, ""By the way, no one else in the world would ever admit that, but I don't care, and again, I'm not gonna say it on TV.""

“What's important when you are in that hedge-fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful because the truth is so against your view, that it's important to create a new truth, to develop a fiction."" Cramer described a variety of tactics that hedge fund managers use to affect a stock's price. Cramer said that one strategy to keep a stock price down is to spread false rumors to reporters he described as ""the Pisanis of the world,"" in reference to CNBC correspondent Bob Pisani, who Cramer insinuated was able to be manipulated, saying ""You have to use these guys.""",VelvetChicken,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ls8m0k/cramer_confusion_on_gme/goq64n0/,0.039,0.839,0.122,0.9281

Why can one tweet drive the entire market down 6%, only for that person to say “LOL, JK” and send the entire market right back to where it was?  Why can one “market analyst” make a tweet that sends a company’s stock down 30% in a day?  Why can CNBC report that a “random unknown JP Morgan analyst raises their price target” and a stock soars, only come crashing right back down the next day?

All that’s perfectly fine now, driven by automated high frequency trading algorithms, but that kind of intraday volatility based only on speculation and market action analysis was unheard of half a century ago.  A bunch of GMEs isn’t going to make the market collapse... it’ll adapt, just like it has been adapting to massive increases in volatility for decades as technology and behavior changes.

Halting trading long term because a price is considered by the wealthy elite to be “too volatile” is just market price fixing.",WiWiWiWiWiWi,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ls8m0k/cramer_confusion_on_gme/gor6iro/,0.029,0.909,0.061,0.8371

2890,GME," Not actually.  He left the industry over 20 years ago, and despite the wild and unfounded accusations here today, he's actually been rather outspoken about how tilted the Wall Street table is against individuals like us.

As I said, I'm a bit disappointed at how Cramer is interpreting the big picture of this situation, as he is uniquely qualified to know that hedge fund manipulation is likely involved.  Of course my argument is undermined by the uncomfortable fact that Cramer did beg his followers to sell GME at $350, which (so far) was a killer call.  

For what it's worth, I defend Cramer against mistruths, but not against everything.  I'll criticize him when it's due. 

GME does not match my portfolio mandate, but I specifically earmarked funds with full expectation of loss for the express reason of supporting people here.  When I saw the ""reduce only mode"" move coordinated by Robinhood, Citadel, Point72 and others, it was one of the most brazen and corrupt things I've seen in decades of Wall Street involvement.  When y'all were locked out of buying, I bought on *your* behalf, and bought a stock I wouldn't and shouldn't otherwise own, in order to be your ally.  I did so knowing and expecting to lose the entirety of that money.

I bought 35 contacts two days ago with a 7.50 strike price and an 8.68 break even Now admittedly I'm relatively new to options and just wanted to understand better.  Was it so you could buy larger quantities at a fractional price? If I understand right you need the stock price to get about those $20+ strike prices and above your BE price to make any profit.

I mean I can't tell you what to do because I'm not a financial advisor so don't trust me and do your research first but if you look up your question on YouTube you will see many videos explaining why you shouldn't exercise your option. From my understanding, you're just leaving profit on the table. If you want to own 100 shares it could be profitable for you because you would be buying them at your strike price of $8 so you'd be paying $800 to own 100 shares and if AMC is shooting up as I hope it will, then it could make sense to exercise your option and continue to hold the shares as they increase. But you're leaving a few hundred or so on the table because your giving up the intrinsic value of the option. But again I am a very dumb ape. Which is not to say apes are dumb. Apes are smart. I'm just a dumb one. Too stupid to give advice on such matters",TheNovaeterrae,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lrn6n8/is_amc_blowing_up_or_am_i_tripping_goddamn_i_like/gomvq8c/,0.112,0.714,0.174,0.8602

They have to sell whatever assets they own (probably stocks) to cover their massive GME losses. They have to sell very quickly because of how quickly GME is moving up... so they liquidate very quickly. That selling pressure pushes the market down, assuming they're selling stocks to cover their GME losses.

3426,AMC," So damn tired of the rich with a voice and public influence belittling those of us who have tried to get ahead, been conservative & accepted the idea of “You’ll get there one day, little guy” while being patted on the head and working our assess off chasing the seemingly unobtainable “American dream.” A month ago, after 35 years of risking nothing, I decided this was worth it. This was my shot to get a tiny bit ahead. As the stock was rocketing, I was applying for brokerage accounts. Robinhood first, because I’d been referred by a family member. Conveniently, they took about 5 days to approve. I had applied for Webull too and, fortunately, they only took a couple of days. Approved on Sunday, so I was waiting for Monday. It started dropping before I could get in. Still, I had alot of hope. I had transferred enough from an account I’d been saving for emergencies for 14 years to buy 2 measly shares. Sounds like nothing to most, but it was a lot for me. Fast forward a few days and I’m immediately $500 in the red. Like a moron, I blindly jumped into something I knew very little about. After a couple days of shock and talking to my wife, I decided I’d hold. For years, if I had to. I didn’t care how low it went. I knew the risk & I jumped in head first anyway. I didn’t think it would come back. I stared at it everyday...hoping and praying. I watched the hearing. I knew we were all being screwed by the wealthy...what else is new? I lost an emergency fund that I’d been saving for 14 years (Sad, I know.) Again, I knew it could happen but, damn, the reality sucked. I’ve spent the past month holding onto my 2 little GME shares while steadily trying to level out with AMC and losing a dollar here and there on penny stocks. I just wanted to get a little back and make my best effort to right my wrong with my family. I’m still in the red, and I may never see green again. But you can bet your ass I’m holding. These “Experts” have made millions just by being “Experts.” Most of us don’t get that opportunity. If they wanna talk down to us & bitch and complain about what we’re trying to do, their core demographic sure as hell isn’t the average Joe. They cater to those that are already wealthy. So, even though my knowledge is extremely limited, I have no choice but to tune out the “Experts.” They have no clue. They can’t relate to reasons behind this movement. They’ll never get it. People wanna poke fun at “The guy in his mom’s basement....har har har.” That guy’s trying to find a way to be able to afford a place of his own. Personally, I’m nearing 40. Married 13 years with a 7 year old that LOVES horses. I desperately want to be able to give her a house on acreage one day. But we can’t save to save our lives. Something always happens. We build up savings, the entire HVAC system dies. Build back up...refrigerator, washer, and dryer all go bad within a week of each other. Build back up...painters find rotten wood behind the siding on our house. HOI won’t cover. Deplete savings to basically have the side of our house rebuilt. So, something like this comes along, and you think it’s finally your chance to get ahead. Immediately, you’re slapped back into reality by losing all of it.

3489,GME," They're definitely doing it again through the ETF's. 

The problem though is if GME goes parabolic, we're going to have a cascading effect on these ETF's. As the shorts sell their positions in the ETF, to cover their GME losses, the ETF price will go down. Retail seeing the price of the ETF going down will sell. This puts pressure, margin calls, losses, interest losses, on those remaining ETF GME shorts.

First one to close out their ETF short position gets minimal damage. Last hedge fund to close out their ETF short will get annihilated. Imagine the effects on the broader market if these ETF's take a shit.

As funny as it would be, this infinity squeeze situation would be very bad for everyone as the entire economy would be sent into the mother of all financial crises.

The fact that it was only done to the high demand stocks is what makes the act illegal.

3583,GME," It still means having a low allocation to bonds but that money has to go somewhere. The 5% ETF fund my 62 year old dad invests in isn't maximizing risk, investing in *many different* companies you think will do well *in the long run* is basically the definition of min-maxing your risk/reward at a young age. Some won't beat the returns of the ETF/total market and you ""lose"", some will absolutely crush that and you'll ""win"". If you chose well your wins will typically beat out your losses over 20-40 years and tah-dah. If you chose poorly, you have 20-40 years of income to supplement your past young decisions with. People say to invest aggressively with greater risk when you're younger because high returns at a young age will compound into astronomical returns down the line. 

Scenario: I invest this 25k into an ETF averaging a generous 7%/year for the next 40 years. That 25k has turned into approximately 400k. During my working career I continue to passively add 5k a year into this. **I'm at about 1.5m by 65**. I retire and live happily with my family.

Scenario 2: I invest this into GME and turn that 25k into 100k in a week and a half. Now that money goes into the same 7% share, and by 65 that 25k has been turned into 1.6m. I still continue to passively add 5k through my working career. **By age 65 I have 2.7m dollars**. I now have enough money for my kids to go to college, and to ensure safety in my future estate and family. I live a worry free live. 

Scenario 3: I turn that 25k into 5k. I still invest that into the same 7% fund and passively add 5k in income each year. **By retirement I'm *still worth* 1.1m** and can retire happily, but maybe can't afford as much for my kids and family as I had hoped.

EDIT2 (10AM): 0 SHORTS AVAILABLE FOR $GME RIGHT NOW. THEY BORROWED OVER 2,100,000 SHARES TO SHORT FOR YESTERDAY AND TODAY! (https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme; https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME) 

IMPORTANT EDIT(5)(10:41AM): CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) ROSE 10 % AND THE WHOLE MARKET IS TAKING DIPS RIGHT NOW. That's exactly what happened back in January in the first Gamma Squeeze. Good sign!

Also: They borrowed 1,500,000 $GME Shares to short yesterday (https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME), but there was no huge drop off or sell volume that would indicate, that they already shorted those. That means, they are now using those shorts as well as the ETFs. 


TL;DR: Millions of shares being sold short today, trying to get people to panic sell. DATA IS FROM 9:45AM.

ROBINHOOD- doesn’t choose when to halt trading. The SEC/NASDAQ does that. RH can restrict trading like they did in January but they CANNOT halt trading.

There are actually TONS of independent comic and games stores across the country. Many have suffered and died thanks to the 'rona. Most have suffered from ridiculous leases with no concessions during 'rona.

IMO the GME Franchise model would be best served by coaxing those stores into buying a franchise and moving into a current GameStop location. GameStop uses the funds to BUY the locations. Most locations include other retail shops which now become renters. GameStop pivots their retail operations into real estate operations and online sales. Let the local shops manage the day-to-day local operations.

4052,GME," Let me give this a shot...

    2/26/2021 100c
    $0.16 @ 9:31AM —> $21.00 @ 3:47PM

The first line is the expiration date (2/26/2021) and the strike price ($100) for the 100 shares of GME (I think “C” is either 100, or “contract”)... doesn’t matter really. 

The second line shows 1) the initial cost for the contract on a per-share basis ($0.16) and what that price increased to ($21). 

So, what this means is that at 9:31AM this morning,  OP owned several contracts to purchase GME at different “strike prices”.  We’re just going to concern ourselves with the first contract with the $100 strike price. 

The first line means that you could have purchased one of OP’s contracts that said you have the option to have the right to 100 shares of GME at the strike price of $100. This contract expires at the end of the day on 2/26/2021. The cost to your for that contract at 9:31AM this morning was for $0.16/share. Since 100 shares are in the contract, this would cost you $16. This cost is called the “premium”.

Nobody purchased that contract from OP. And, at 3:47PM this contract was now worth $21/share. Again, 100 shares in the contract means that contract is now worth $2,100. 

This is an increase in value of 13,000%... it gained value by a factor of 131.25.

The contract expires at the end of the day on 2/26/2021. So, let’s say you bought the contract at 9:31AM this morning when it was $0.16/share. You paid $16. That’s your cost no matter what happens on 2/21/2016. 

Let’s now say you hold into that contract through 2/26. At the end of the day on 2/26/2021, let’s say a share of GME is $50. Obviously, you don’t want to buy 100 shares of GME at $100 each, because you’d lose value. You’d have spent $100 x 100 + $16 = $10,016 for 100 shares that you could have purchased for $5,000. You don’t have to buy at the strike price - you just have the option to exercise your right at that price (or not). But, either way, on 2/26 you’re left holding a bag with a contract in it that’s basically worthless. But, it only cost you $16 for the opportunity to hold that bag. You are a true retard. 

In that case, OP made $16, you lost $16.

But, let’s say that at the end of the day 2/26/2021, a single share of GME is worth $150. Now, this is a different scenario! You now have the contract that says you can buy all 100 shares of GME at the price of $100/share. So, you go ahead and exercise that right. Now, you’ve spent $10,016 and you now have $15,000 worth of GME stock. Let’s say your turned around and sold that stock right away for $150/share. You now just made $4,984 ($15,000-$10,016). OP made $16, and he’s wishing he still had the contract that would have given him the opportunity to buy GME at $100/share. He’s the retard. 

Let’s say though, you don’t have $10,000 ($100/share) to purchase GME stock when the contract expires. But, you bought that contract when it was only worth $16... and, you still want to make some money from your $16 premium. You can still make some money!!

At 3:37PM this afternoon, that contract was worth $2,100! You own the contract and can do whatever you want with it. You could sell the contract to someone else for $2100. The purchaser of that contract now has the option to buy GME for $100/share on 2/26. 

At this point, you don’t care what happens because you just turned $16 into $2100 for a $2,084 profit. Yeah, it’s not quite a $4,984 profit, but you were never going to be able to realize that profit because you didn’t have $10,000 to buy out your contract anyway.

That’s why OP should get rid of those contracts with an $800 strike price. Maybe OP is loaded as fuck, but if he’s not $80,000 loaded to buy 100 shares of GME at $800 a share, then he should sell those contracts to some other retard (who may be the one holding the bag with a worthless contract in it).",ReadItWithSarcasm,6,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lrnptn/i_like_the_stock_options/goog0ox/,0.043,0.87,0.088,0.9289
