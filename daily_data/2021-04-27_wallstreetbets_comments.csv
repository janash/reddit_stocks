A large part of why they call it a rat race is uncertainty, fear, and stress.  

A lot of people that picture getting out of the rat race picture retiring to a beach and sipping fruity alcoholic conxotions.

There is a difference between having a career and being part of the rat race. 

There is a HUGE value and peace of mind that comes from having a well stocked IRA when you are young.

150,RH," RH doesn't care if you make money or not. But the people they sell your data to care. The implication being, RH sells your order flow to Citadel. Citadel sets a counter order at the right price. Your order gets matched with theirs without ever going to market.

When you trade on RH, you're not trading with the market, you're trading in a sandbox where the prices are higher. It's like trying to buy a fair price hotdog at a baseball stadium. They've been fined multiple times by the SEC for failing to give proper price improvement.

But it's still hard to believe that an order would be something like 35% below the asking price. Normally they just nickel and dime you, but this is like Benjamin-ing you.

A few possibilities I can think of:

1. He lost money but only because they stop loss didn't trigger at the price he was expecting it to when it executed. So it went up 10%, then down 30%.
2. He created a stop loss with a limit price too close to the stoping price. So when it dropped, it left his order in the dust.
3. He was trading something (options or stocks) with insanely low volume or very high spread. Causing a massive lost (Could happen with options, but still unlikely).
4. Robinhood/Citadel really did a number on his order's price improvement. If this is the case, and he lost any type of real money. He could absolutely sue if his order really sold for 40% below the market value at the time. Order limit or no.
5. OP is lying or misleading.",ShadowyInsights,17,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mzhf76/shout_out_to_umeiggs_who_accidentally_bought_50k/gw1jsjf/,0.145,0.764,0.09,-0.9441

336,GME," 183 months. Just over 15 years.

Approximately two thirds of that growth will occur in the final year, requiring an average of 2MM shares per month. If we assume the price remains fixed at $200 for the next 14 years (which I somehow suspect you don't believe will happen), acquiring over 24MM shares will require an annual income of (at minimum) $4.75B after taxes.

And before you remind me that you're selling calls to make up the difference, there aren't enough GME calls in the world to give you the money you need in that time frame. Honestly, living to 7,000 is more believable than what would be necessary to pull off exponential growth.

 I, like all of you, have been recklessly investing in hot button companies that probably shouldn't be doing well.  It's fun. 

Thing about this one is: I have personally improved my depression with targeted use of psychedelics ‚Äì this shit really works. I am not a doctor, or even close, but I suffered for years with persistent drug resistant depression and the use of psychedelics with the intention of improving my mental health provided astonishing long term results. I have tried about 9 available prescriptions and truly, none of them came remotely close to providing the relief that 2-3 doses was able to provide, and with lasting results. I am still feeling significant relief 6 months on from my last dose. 

I am not from a liberal background and would have never expected to be endorsing a company like MNMD, but these are the companies curing depression. Is it going to b MNMD that does it? ‚Äì No idea. But it's not even a bet, it's an actual investment that I can believe in (fucking finally)

489,MNMD," If you plan to stay in MNMD until it at least doubles, you'll make way more money buying MindMed **warrants.**

I favor the one expiring in 2024, with stock symbol **MMDCF.**

Here's a brief explanation, with rounded figures for ease of understanding:

MNMD is currently ~$5/share. MMDCF is ~$1.50/share.

MMDCF has an exercise price ~$5.50. Translation: Buying one unit of MMDCF = buying the right to buy a share of MNMD for $5.50.

Suppose you spend $15 today on MMED (3 shares) and $15 on MMDCF (10 shares). Time passes and MNMD reaches $10/share. Here's your profit margin:

**MNMD:** $5 shares now worth $10 -> your 3 shares are worth $30  (**100% profit**, 2x orig investment)

**MMDCF:** each warrant lets you buy a share worth $10 by paying $5.50 on top of your initial $1.50, for a total profit of $3. You don't actually have to lay out the cash to exercise; you can just sell the warrants to someone else. So your $1.50 shares are now worth $4.50 -> your 10 shares are worth $45 (**200% profit**, 3x orig investment)

The higher the share price ends up, the better the multiplier. And the lower you share price when you buy, the better the multiplier.

Since options aren't currently available, warrants are the next-best thing, and probably the best thing outright if you're looking to invest for a year or longer.

494,MNMD," I believe it's a buy anywhere under $6CAD. Here are just some bullet points for why I am invested in this. Disclaimer: I am not an experienced investor. I'm just a guy who likes this stock and I want to tell you why I do.

* This is *not* like the cannabis thing. Mind Medicine does not need political support.The substances they intend to use to treat addiction, anxiety, depression will be developed as *medicines*. The path to that objective is well trodden and clear. FDA approval has a set of parameters to meet that are layed out clearly. FDA approval is achievable through scientific trials. This eliminates the need to fight and win political battles to become profitable. Considering that the data we do have now strongly suggests these substances are extraordinarily safe, our chances of approval are good.

* There is a ton of anecdotal data suggesting these medicines work very well to treat addiction, anxiety and depression. Better than what is currently on the market. There is some very compelling hard data as well. Treating end of life anxiety with psychedelics as well as trauma has been studied and the results are very promising. Go read about this. 

* Mind Medicine is not attempting to develop just one medical product. They are developing *several*. Some may prove to not work as expected. But this diverse pipeline means they have several paths to profit. 

* Mind Medicine are already working on solving some key problems related to a post-FDA approval world. They bought a telehealth company and are recruiting and training psychiatrists. In an interview, Rahn (CEO) pointed out that he is serious about solving the opioid addiction problem. He also pointed out how opioid addiction is often found in rural areas. In order to be prescribed a treatment that may cure the addiction the patient needs a psychiatrist to assess, diagnose and prescribe. Rural areas often don't have access to a psychiatrist. But they probably have internet. Mind Medicine is seeking to recruit and train psychiatrists in this new treatment method and to *deliver those psychiatrists to the patients* via a telehealth technology! The potential for Mind Medicine to be a disruptor seems very real to me.

* The CEO, is very focused on actually solving growing mental health problems. In one key interview I listened to, the interviewer kept trying to pull Rahn into the legalization debate. Rahn just wouldn't have it. He just wants to solve mental health problems and he sees that the best way to do that is to go the FDA route and deliver treatment to patients. For investors this means that Rahn is focused on becoming a medical tech company. This means creating medical *products* with the means of distributing to as a wide a network of patients as possible. This plus the diverse pipeline I mentioned before make the possibility of true profitability that much higher. 

I'm not under any illusion that MNMD isn't exactly what it is at this point: a speculative investment. But to me it checks off a lot of boxes. Bypass this drug war nonsense, to get the human population suffering with debilitating mental health issues the treatment they sorely need. Personally, my conscience tells me I *have* to invest in this. Win or lose, it's the right thing for me to do. I have 50% of my total net worth in MNMD. My goal is HODL the fuck out of this stock. I will not even think about selling a single share until post $10CAD. And I will keep at least half my shares until 2023 minimum.

510,PM," I am in no way a doctor and can't give medical advice. Here is an article published in the scientific journal Nature:

[Emotions and brain function are altered up to one month after a single high dose of psilocybin | Scientific Reports (nature.com)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-59282-y) 

It looks like the answer to your question could be yes, but remember all of this is still in early stages of research so if you decide to do it please do not do it alone and please start with a very low dosage. Make sure you are in a safe / stress free place and with someone you trust when taking it. 

I've done shrooms for fun with friends before but my last several trips have been in the middle of depressive episodes. Trips with friends are usually fun, kind of like smoking marijuana recreationally. However, taking it in a depressive episode is not fun whatsoever. I grin and bare it because the mental turnaround at about hour 3 - 4 for me is absolutely day and night. I also know how it affects ME and I know that there is a light at the end of the tunnel. My mental state changes drastically and I usually am inspired to create / do something productive like read or write music in the afterglow. This effect persists for a couple of months for me (i'm not high, my disposition is noticeably changed). 

Although the initial research is showing that I am not alone in my experience with psilocybin, it's very important to reiterate that my experience is purely anecdotal and should be taken with a grain of salt. Also, depending on the country you live in, it could be very risky to procure. Here in America it's a Schedule 1 narcotic so it's on the same list as heroin, meth and cocaine (eyeroll). If you are prone to anxiety doing a Schedule 1 narcotic might be a bit much for you. You are the only one who knows yourself.

Last bit of advice: try to get consistent with meditation (mindfulness or transcendental). This might help your anxiety but in my experience it's helped me navigate some harsher trips that I've had. I can pull myself back to center by focusing on breathing etc.

Feel free to PM me if you have any other questions. Like I said, it's been life altering for me and I can't wait for the day where I (and others) can get prescribed this as a treatment.",KingSam89,8,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mzo16c/mnmd_yolo_shroom_boom/gw2squr/,0.073,0.757,0.17,0.993

624,MNMD," If you plan to stay in MNMD until it at least doubles, you'll make way more money buying MindMed **warrants.**

I favor the one expiring in 2024, with stock symbol **MMDCF.**

Here's a brief explanation, with rounded figures for ease of understanding:

MNMD is currently ~$5/share. MMDCF is ~$1.50/share.

MMDCF has an exercise price ~$5.50. Translation: Buying one unit of MMDCF = buying the right to buy a share of MNMD for $5.50.

Suppose you spend $15 today on MMED (3 shares) and $15 on MMDCF (10 shares). Time passes and MNMD reaches $10/share. Here's your profit margin:

**MNMD:** $5 shares now worth $10 -> your 3 shares are worth $30  (**100% profit**, 2x orig investment)

**MMDCF:** each warrant lets you buy a share worth $10 by paying $5.50 on top of your initial $1.50, for a total profit of $3. You don't actually have to lay out the cash to exercise; you can just sell the warrants to someone else. So your $1.50 shares are now worth $4.50 -> your 10 shares are worth $45 (**200% profit**, 3x orig investment)

The higher the share price ends up, the better the multiplier. And the lower you share price when you buy, the better the multiplier.

Since options aren't currently available, warrants are the next-best thing, and probably the best thing outright if you're looking to invest for a year or longer.

MMDCF is good. This is not financial advice.",jleonardbc,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mzla97/mnmd_focusss_soon_my_first_100k_ever_in_lifee/gw2d8qe/,0.008,0.786,0.205,0.9917

695,PEAK," I honestly think with all the Robinhood fuckery, they have algorithms to falsely show you something goes down after you buy it, just so you sell it.  It happens far far too often.. I actually did this today basically knowing what was going to happen and just wanted to test my theory.

MVIS : been watching it a couple days.  Hopped on at about 7am.  Sold shares in other stock and dumped it all in MVIS.  The INSTANT I bought it, it immediately goes down and apparently I bought it at the 0.01% worst time to (as I suspected).

I purchased at 8:30 am : Average Per Share $27.60, current cost $19.47.  And this happens far too much, you can watch something on your list climb, but the literal SECOND you purchase it, it tanks.  I legit bought it at the highest point TO THE CENT, not once cent higher nor lower, I purchased at the HIGHEST PEAK TO DATE coincidently.

Not that I went in hard, and it wasnt even $1000 worth but this happens like 90% of the time, they instant you buy on Robinhood, it goes down almost no matter what the stock is.  Just odd.

GME has consistently consolidated at different price points, and one that seems to keep coming up is $175/share or ~$12B market cap, so I don't see this price moving too much unless there's some more good news coming. What has worked well for me for GME is waiting for a price to consolidate and stay in a spread of of ~4% for at least a week and then making a move. I've been able to get in at $35 before the first run up, $42 before the second, and finally $150 before the current one. 

Comments here can be a double sided sword. You can learn a lot, but you can be talked out of your convictions. Imagine if DFV listened to everyone a year ago and didn't load up on various OTM calls? He wouldn't be sitting on $30M right now. 

I hope that you're able to triple that stimmy with whatever direction you decide to go!",BiteableTugboat,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mzpzzj/yoled_everything_on_gme_i_believe_the_price_will/gw3bnz6/,0.04,0.9,0.06,0.6963

Can you link a screenshot of your order receipt to this comment so we can verify your position?

EDIT: OP has only a few min left to verify the position or ban.

EDIT 2: OP provided the link so I'm doing the math now  [https://imgur.com/a/LpcYIi6](https://imgur.com/a/LpcYIi6)

EDIT 3: OP only provided trade verification of 173,861 shares. We do not know his cost average or when he purchased the other 252,800 shares. Still waiting for a response.

FINAL EDIT:  OP added the rest of his trades here  [https://imgur.com/a/3RQBy8U](https://imgur.com/a/3RQBy8U) I did the rough math on his trades and seems like the cost average $3.56 checks out. Y'all can check it and do the math too.

844,ON," My bad okay so no forget what I told you. I forget I know more than I do. Go the spy $422c ON 4/30 thats the $60 I'm talking abt. All the pricing is x100! Think of it as a game and its a super mulitiplier!! So if it says .6 to buy that contract will cost $60. Theres way more to it than that but this is the basic concept.

This is called buying a call, sometimes you they say long call. Idk. Next thing we do is we wait for a market dip minimum of -0.25% in abt 5mins. Quicker the better for dailies. Gotta buy quick tho but capable of a+200% increase if you pick the right way and TIME. Always sell your buyin if you hit. 

Use optionscalculator.Com and plugs in you're values. See possible returns and losses. And how quick lol. Its about super leverage and you have no calateral like shares. Just the option. 

Also this is just one way to do it! There are plenty of others. This i would definitely rate this as a way crazy play if you don't know what the hell im talking abt at all. This is max degenerate ‚Äê60% or +500% level retard

Regarding your latest comment, the AG, while appointed by the president and a member of the cabinet, is supposed to operate independently.

The bill you‚Äôre referencing got majority support from both republicans and democrats in the house and senate. He signed it after being pressured by his son-in-law and other advisers. Good on him for signing it. But it‚Äôs no secret that he ran as ‚Äútough on crime‚Äù and had the backing of private prisons. He also told Lopez Obrador that it was time to wage war against the drug cartels and the US would help Mexico wipe them out. Doesn‚Äôt sound like a guy who is against the war on drugs.

1146,MVIS," Shorting is when an investor borrows shares of a stock and sells them. You do this when you expect the stock to go down. If it does, you can pick them up cheaper, and give them back, keeping the difference. Borrowed and sold at $100. Replaced at $90. Kept $10 profit.

When you make this sort of deal you need to replace the shares you borrowed in a certain time period, say a few days or weeks or months. If the stock goes up, you‚Äôll be facing having to buy it for more than you sold it for, eating the loss. If it goes up a lot you might not even have enough money to replace the shares you borrowed. You could hope it goes back down, but that doesn‚Äôt help if it doesn‚Äôt go back down before your contract expires. 20% of of MVIS has been borrowed and sold by someone who is now in just this predicament. The more people who buy it, the harder it is for the short sellers to replace their borrowed stocks. Hence why everyone here is buying it right now. 

Not financial advice - just answering the question. Someone‚Äôs gotta lose $1 for someone else to make $1 just the same.

Been in a channel for 8 months & all of Wall Street knows Bill Miller just said AMZN will double in Barron's so they're just waiting for a reason to send it. üöÄ[https://twitter.com/JGreenwald86/status/1385585022585954311](https://twitter.com/JGreenwald86/status/1385585022585954311)

Technically it looks like a 5-star set up on a chart. Sitting at ATH's right now waiting for a reason to break out. A big earnings beat sends it higher or a split sends it higher. If they don't have numbers that get them there I expect them to play the Split card. If we get an earnings beat plus a split then we're talking a once in a lifetime move for a biz their size - maybe 50% gains in the 1-2 months. Last time it consolidated this long it doubled in a leg up in 2-3 months.

If there's a 6 to 1 or more split I bet we see +10% Friday even on average earnings.

I figure Bezos wants to give Jassy a win as new CEO and doesn't want the stock to languish any longer. A split is an ace in his pocket he's held onto for years. Big reason its stalled is the fact that it's 4k freaking dollars. A split means retail can jump in on shares & call options.

An earnings beat means analyst after analyst will trip over each other upgrading their PT's.

If we get either good earnings or a split I think we have 4k upside in the next month at least.

Anyhow I've spent a lot of time doing DD on this and wanted to bring it to the fam. Would suck if I got rich/poor without you.

I think calls are the move since we're either in for sideways or üöÄüåï. I'm thinking **June 4 @ 4,000 strike.**

1340,IRS," New report this morning from undisclosed source follows rumors from last week of increased capital gains taxes.

**Key Points:**

* **Ending ""step-up basis"" for inheritances.**   the ‚Äústep up in basis‚Äù loophole allows heirs to use the market value of assets at the time of inheritance rather than the actual purchase price as the cost basis for capital gains when the holdings are sold.  ending this would mean much higher tax bills for wealthy estates
* **Increase of tax rate for the highest bracket (>$400k) from 37% to 39.6%** - impacting around 1% of taxpayers that earn in this bracket.  (Reminder that US income tax is **progressive**, which means that only income over $400k is taxed at the 39.6% rate.)
* **$80B in new funding for the IRS** to audit wealthy individuals and companies, that some are estimating could generate $700B in revenue.   The IRS has long been calling for more resources, with Commissioner Chuck Rettig stating at a congressional panel that as much as $1T in taxes go uncollected each year.
* **Biden to reveal his ""American Families Plan"" to Congress on Wednesday (4/28/21)** - expected to cost from $1 to $1.8T - expected to feature funding for paid leave, childcare, and education.

1351,IRS," 1) Well there goes even more family farms....oh you didn't know that applied to those too?  Yep.  Thats the insidious thing here.  Most family farms are worth well over $1 million once all the equipment and necessary buildings are taken into account.

So now we are going to Tax them into selling to pay one Tax bill only to have them get slapped by another one for the value they were able to get out of the sale.  Way to make sure the family never recovers.

1361,TV," >	if you can‚Äôt afford to pay for a phone in cash then you can‚Äôt afford it. If you struggle to pay your bills why are you buying a new phone?

Because you might be able to afford, say, $80 and an extra $3.33/mo on your bill, but not $880 all up front. But then on the flip side you'd tell anyone who paid $800 upfront that they're dumb for not taking advantage of 0% interest financing AND an extra $700 off the total. I just think the phone argument was not the best one to make.

In general, I don't fault lower class people for taking advantage of good deals like that, or say, owning a TV. Little ""luxuries"" like those don't change the circumstances they're in. Trust me, I visit these people in their homes every day with my job. That TV may be big, but it's a budget model for like $2-300 at Wal-Mart. Cell phones are typically whatever free crap Android phone they got at Metro or Boost, with some used, cracked iPhone held together with a cheap plastic screen protector and a flea market case, if they're lucky. Video games are usually whatever 1 or 2 gen old console and games they got at Goodwill.

1431,GME,"  The two biggest catalysts for a ***huge*** upswing in a short period of time would be a short squeeze on the 35%+ short interest (I personally think the short interest in practicality is much higher until July 5th when restrictions come off PIPE and all other insider shares) or political tailwind with the Medicare age being reduced to 50 from 65 ([https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/proposal-lower-medicare-age-50-130000091.html](https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/proposal-lower-medicare-age-50-130000091.html)).

1439,TX," Clover Health's biggest feature is machine AI learning to suggest routes of treatment through predictive factors from patients in the system and telehealth which is increasing in usage in the US that CVS and Walgreens are also doing. The biggest limitation is the growth of people on their systems. 

&#x200B;

The insurance model is a PPO currently serving AZ, GA, MI, NJ, PA, SC, TN, and TX for Medicare Advantage who are age 65 or older due to Medicare requirements. I just wonder how Clover Health is going to decrease medication costs for patients since PPO is filled at a CVS, Rite Aid, or Walgreens, and drug prices are negotiated by either Cardinal, Mckesson's, or whoever is their supplier.

1471,MVIS, Original shorts get in on a stock price fall usually. This adds selling pressure at that time and usually will see the stock go down with momentum trading with people selling and shorting. When a squeeze starts to trigger old shorts exit and new shorts come in and try to time the market. Any other time you are correct to the net zero On this. But with this usually buy orders start to consume sell orders and the shorts that got in trying to time buy back in and causes more of a frenzy with buy orders and people fomoing. MVIS is a good example especially today.

1878,CLF," prices for finished steel products have pretty much tripled across the board since their lows during covid and haven‚Äôt shown any sign of dropping. Futures are elevated 40% above historical averages through Q1 2022. There‚Äôs no sign of demand slowing down, and reopening nations passing infrastructure bills as post-covid stimulus and green energy initiatives will only keep things hot.

That staying power in high pricing is ***not baked in.***

Steel producer‚Äôs overhead is pretty stable outside of shipping and feedstock (iron ore) pricing - companies that are vertically integrated upstream (across Ore) and downstream (across shipping) will see their margins EXPLODE without realizing too much overhead expansion.

Enter ***$CLF,*** the largest flat rolled steel producer and ONLY electrical steel producer in the US (integrated upstream, and largely insulated from shipping due to supplying domestically) and ***$MT,*** the largest steel producer in the world (integrated both up and downstream).

Both of these companies have a license to print money for the next 12+ months. This is only just getting started.

CLF projects $4 BILLION in EBITDA this year. Their market cap is 9 billion. They are going to make half their market cap in cash in a SINGLE calendar year. Think about that.",olivesnolives,19,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mzcbzf/2x_to_3x_for_x_aka_us_steel_corp/gw0pmj3/,0.027,0.922,0.052,0.7351

1908,AMZN," Since i wrote that initial comment at the ass crack of dawn, I'd like to elaborate. 

The question we must ask is what is the purpose of this stock split? 

1. Amazon wants to be included in the Dow jones. Since this is a price weighted index, not a market cap weighted index, Amazon would need to split into the $200 range hence a split of roughly 15:1. 
2. On the other hand, Amazon could just split otherwise theyll turn into a Berkshire Hathaway type of stock with massive share price. This is also possible but Jeff Bezos is not a fan of stock splits to appeal to retail investors, the last stock split for AMZN was in the late 90s. 

Regardless, any sort of split would be huge for amazon.",foxhalo,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mzgw5u/amzn_split_possible_this_thursday_call_fam_unite/gw1w2ri/,0.035,0.857,0.108,0.701
