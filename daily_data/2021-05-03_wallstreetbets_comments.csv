Problem is the book value is quite pitiful at $3.78 and it's trading at almost a whopping 11x that. So, to reference your margin of safety, it's actually not a big margin.

Also, and this may be just me, but there's something very uncomfortable about a company buying back their stock to drive the price higher then doing an offer once it is higher. That's sketchy as hell. 

I would consider calls on this, definitely would not take a long position. As for the earnings report this week, don't bet on it. Unless they double what is expected, it will likely go down anyway.

153,DD," Some thoughts on Pluto TV and why it's a game changer.  After reading this DD, I went to Pluto TV.  Literally, just searched Pluto TV, hit the link and was immediately watching ""The Soloist"" on my screen.  There was a guide at the bottom to scroll through for other programs.  The Soloist is just what popped up first.  

Here's the thing.  I run a Linux based operating system (Ubuntu) as my main media purposed machine as well as another named ArchLinux for personal computing.  And anybody that runs these platforms for media knows the headaches many content providers create by trying to protect their content via DRM (Digital Rights Management).  So, while, the content may be streamed from a Linux server (looking at you Amazon), the ability to watch the content on a Linux based machine can be problematic if the proper DRM decoding isn't happening on the receiving machine.  

Disney+ screwed this up pretty bad when advertising their service as being available on all devices and Linux users immediately signing up, giving Disney their money and finding out that their machines didn't qualify as ""all devices"".  This was corrected by Disney to their credit, but it did take a few weeks to work it out.  

This is important to note because the average consumer doesn't have the knowledge or ability to work through a DRM issue with their device when their device somehow ends up non-compliant.  This has happened with Bluray playback devices, Amazon Prime, Netflix, Hulu.  Pretty much all of them.  

The industry standard answer has always been to go buy a new compliant device or, in the case of Bluray, to hook up your device to the internet and download new firmware.  Given your playback device had the capability.  If not, you were fucked.  

Again, this is all in a response to what the OP is talking about in the pirating industry.  The content creators are trying to protect their IP (Intellectual Property), and they have a right to do so.  But in the past, mostly it was protected via advertising.  The money these channels made was never from the consumer, but rather the advertiser.  Redistribution of free content has never really been a problem.

Never really been a problem that is, until recently, when that content was making it's way into streaming services that were fee based.  Want to watch ""The Office"", no problem, every past season is on Netflix and even though at release it was free to watch on NBC via an old school antenna, now it costs you money.  Then on top of that fee, you need to jump through the hoops Netflix puts in place to ensure the content is protected from piracy.  But, yay, no commercials.  So, you've got that.  

This is all to say that streaming services are still a very new thing in how we consume media. And many streaming services are struggling to maintain their fee based structure, while ALSO protecting their content from piracy (Come on, EVERYBODY has seen Game of Thrones.  There aren't that many people with HBO subscriptions.)

So, we have multiple problems in the streaming industry.  And the bulk of consumers have no idea how to navigate those problems, or even that those problems exist.  What they want to do is plug in their device hit a button and start watching TV.  

So, when I say that I just opened my browser on a traditionally non-compliant device (Though I have DRM enabled through Chrome), and was able to immediately start watching TV.  No registration, no username, or more importantly password that I need to remember for my mother-in-law because she'll forget it.  Nothing.  Just log in and start streaming live TV.  

Fuck, it doesn't even need to be good TV.  It just needs to be TV, and some shit people are familiar with or somewhat recognize.  

This model is a game changer and it'll be interesting to see if it's sustainable as all revenue is going to come through advertising.  But, it's accessible in an industry that is making a lot of people feel really dumb when trying to find a way to watch The Andy Griffith Show.  Something they just got for free with little hassle has become so complicated that many consumers are incredibly frustrated. 

So, I'm in.  I'll be buying some VIAC tomorrow.  

I tested Pluto TV on 4 different browsers.  Chrome, Chromium, Firefox and Opera.  The only one I had an issue with was Opera, but I have that running through a VPN and other customizations.  

This is a big deal.  Don't know if it'll make money in the streaming space.  But its simplicity is needed in a world of growing complexity when it comes to media consumption.",minivanman714,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n3k1gk/god_tier_dd_viac/gwtzqsq/,0.066,0.83,0.103,0.9795

If the market were to suddenly drop, every stock will likely fall, no matter how good the business is or how strong the fundamentals are.

178,VIAC," I would argue you see the same for most stocks since the March 2020 crash. Almost all stocks have seen hyperinflation since then. For VIAC and others there was a unique partially closed system event that erased the run since then. The rest of the market is still experiencing that euphoric rise.

Assuming eventual market wide downturn:

The bearish outlook is that VIAC will tank twice when the euphoria evaporates and the market turns over.

The bullish outlook is that it's now more of a value stock than a growth, and is therefore a safer investment should the market take a downturn. Value stocks are a safe haven during a crash.

  


OTOH, assuming the market will continue growing like it has over the past decade for the foreseeable future:

Bullish take, VIAC is holding at 2019 support and given the previous growth stock PE, could move in that direction again.

Bearish take, there's enough uncertainty around VIAC that until it breaks out of the current horizontal channel, investment in the market is going to yield better returns and is a safer investment.",sullx,5,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n3k1gk/god_tier_dd_viac/gwquxxa/,0.05,0.767,0.182,0.9773

The Champions League is NHL tier in the states theres growth to be had there but the only thing that is going to put Soccer in the US mainstream is the US National team actually doing something at consecutive world cups.

But Pluto is interesting.  I've perused it on Roku and for an entirely free option its got enormous growth potential the question is can it beat out Peacock or IMDB for the free streaming war.  Peacock has all the NBC shows plus the WWE on it.  IMDB has a ton of great movies and shows.  Pluto has a strange assortment of either far left or far right news sources 24 hour channels of niche shows and what can only be described as channels 100-200 on old digital cable lineups.

There streaming service for the monthly cost in an already saturated market is subpar compared to competitors.  They seemed to have developed it as an afterthought since it was CBS all access then they decided years too late you know we should probably put the entire CBS and Paramount catalog on one service.

193,VIAC," Don't be fooled. This thing is HIGHLY speculative. I got in around mid 30's and wrote a 45 covered call when it crossed 40. Got hit on the call and then was kicking myself when it ran. Bought back in at 39 something not long ago. 

The problems with VIAC are many. First, their streaming platform is trash. I just don't see it being as sticky as HBOMax or D+. Second, their legacy business that drives cash flow is in the absolute toilet. That business is 100% tied to OTA and cable. T just reported losing 620k cable subs in Q1. Those sorts of losses are going to shred VIAC's legacy business because ad rates and carriage fees are going to continue to evaporate. Of course, a few good quarters of flashy growth numbers on streaming and the market will forget how big of a turd the legacy business is. 

My investment thesis on this is it has to be attractive as an M&A play or else I'm not interested. Right now it's still a bit rich to be an M&A target, but it's not totally out of the realm of possibility. There is so much cash out there someone might take a gamble on it. The content portfolio is really big and someone has to want it.

Is the thought ..that GME will hit its peak again at over 300 a share? Or more?  Or is another 75 to 100 gain appropriate?  Or is the potential gain lays in a futures Or option activity that is still to manifest? If so..what is the configuration?

I am asking to learn...
And I am not able to buy in anyways right now...

I am truly seeking knowledge.

Pretty risky but worth it IMO. I'm talking with a lawyer and supply chain dude in SK for advice, seriously considering it, it'd only cost me 1-2K to invest in a decent quantity, and I can resell them in the short term locally for 2x profit to scale my collection up.

958,AI," Apparently some people have implemented neural networks in SQL.  Not very practical though. Incidentally, most machine learning libraries are written in C or C++ which originated in the 70's and 80's respectively.  Most data scientists use API's for these frameworks made for newer, easier to use languages like python, R or lua, which originated in the early 90s to early 2000's.  If they chose to write in C or C++, it would probably be more optimized though... not enough to matter of course, as all of the heavy lifting is done in the natively compiled language.  Of course this is an oversimplification because these languages have been continuously updated since their release.. and I am not mentioning CUDA, just kinda lumping that in with C and C++ and it can be considered as a superset of the latter.

Now if we are talking about Artificial General Intelligence.. or ""true AI"", thats a completely different story--as it has not currently been achieved. And I believe the most optimal way of going about that would have less to do with programming languages and more to do with computer architecture. Computers are deterministic systems,  so they can be used to model probabilistic systems like AI, but perhaps a better model would not use the Von Neumann Architecture.  Personally, I think an analog circuit might be better suited to the task.. as it would be orders of magnitude faster and would not require high levels of precision because it does not need to be deterministic.   Of course this would also be applicable to many broader machine learning problems as well imo.  But I think the only way you could model a brain, for instance, without taking up an entire floor of a building in server space.. would be to go that route.

969,GDP," Nominal GDP growth (NGDP) = real GDP growth (RGDP) + inflation.

If NGDP growth has run at, on average, 4 to 5% per annum since 20210 and inflation had averaged 8-10%, then RGDP must have averaged somewhere between -5 to -7% every year. 

At -5% every year for 10 years, the economy would be roughly 40% smaller. At -7% every year for 10 years, the economy would be roughly 51% smaller.

>money in circulation isn't consistent with the real economy anymore

The quantity of money is supplied based on money demand, which is the inverse of money velocity [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2V](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2V). If there had not been ample money in the economy, interest rates would've shot up, NGDP would have collapsed further. NGDP is total spending in the economy -> less loans issued and at higher real rates, people would not have been able to pay back older loans issued under higher inflation expectations, much higher unemployment due to no wage growth since wages are sticky downwards, etc.

TLDR: If there hadn't been plenty of money in the economy, it would have been an economic catastrophe on the scale of the great depression, which was also caused and prolonged by a collapse of the money supply.",MinhNguyenPFL,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n3db4o/how_to_profit_from_runaway_inflation/gws1uop/,0.095,0.827,0.078,-0.4404

997,RKT," RKT price will go up when people see it as a stable and growing long-term hold. I think that's the problem for the stock. And it makes sense that people should be cautious about it, since it IPO'd just last August. 

But a rule of thumb I've heard is to wait 6 months after an IPO then see if the executives are buying or selling their own shares and how the price is doing then. Well, we're now past that time period and Rocket Companies has already stated that they plan to buy back $1 billion worth of shares.

This earning report is also important because it shows how well the company is doing after around 6 months have passed since the IPO. Maybe this earnings report would make the difference which convinces masses of people to add some shares of RKT to their long-term portfolio. 

That's the kind of thing which would increase volume for a long time, thus pushing up the price.

And if that's what's about to happen, RKT at around $22.50 right now is a bargain.

People are acting like RKT is some well-established stock that's been around a long time and everyone's supposed to understand how great it is. The truth is that it takes time for the public to get to know a stock after it's been IPO'd.

This could be a good opportunity right now to get in early while it's low. But it all depends on the public viewing it as a long-term hold.

Speaking of long-term hold, that massive $500 million purchase of shares a month ago at $25.25/share looks a lot like a large institution which is convinced that RKT is a good long-term hold.",patmcirish,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n3x0yn/why_im_all_in_on_rkt/gwtf5vj/,0.018,0.786,0.196,0.9947

1027,IT," Companies like Nokia and Ericsson have a small window of earnings of 3-4 years when new technologies are being deployed like 4G and 5G. They get orders from Telecom companies and after executing them there is not much income for both.   
Both companies need to diversify so that their income is less dependent on acceptance of new technologies. At the moment Ericsson is getting more orders for executing 5G infrastructure deployments and they have been diversifying at better pace than Nokia into a IT services company. Due to this, There is a credible threat that Nokia would be no more in 3-4 years even if they get new 5G orders as income would dry up in future. Also, Ericsson cannot buy/merge with Nokia due to competition law in US as Ericsson will have more than 70% market share if it happens, giving Ericson monopoly in this sector.

1030,RKT, Sorry I guess i was not clear but the initial mortgages you get are all covered by your initial investments and income so those mortgages themselves are safe assuming you dont lose your job/income.   The point of this post was similar to a poor man covered call you can use mortgages in a similar way to cover yourself to sell puts/calls.  Is this case if you sell your calls on a hedging position of your initial investment as long as the housing market does not crash near the beginning of opening your mortgages you can actually make profit leveraging much of your assets and capital no matter which way the market moves.  Since RKT is also a meme stock at the same time I believe this strategy will let you play the volatility in all directions with maximum exposure.

1038,TSLA," such as? 

granted a lot of the shit some companies are ""selling"" isn't worth a tenth of the valuation, but those companies are getting hammered pretty hard and pretty efficiently. ie getting called on their bullshit in very public ways and getting shorted to oblivion.

ie. nikola, (clover), hyliion, lordstown motors.

the democratization of information will make this next crash very interesting. in 1999, the internet was nascent and most retail investors had no idea wtf was going on with most websites or how to research ""web companies,"" so i really wonder if the crash will be more of an agonizing death to a bunch of retardedly valuated companies, who can no longer benefit from cheap credit rather. If that's the case, I welcome it.

I think people have not been really acknlowdging that the major drivers of the US economy aren't necessarily over valued or stagnant. The top 5 companies blew past all consensus earnings and there's no foreseeable downturn in demand for their actual products. They lost a few points because people were worried about weather they could ""grow any more."" Lol - if theres anything that's for sure, its that people will always want more. We keep trying to compare current valuations with past valuations, but the growth cycle of companies in the internet age has accelerated and forward looking P/Es need to accommodate. For example, the growth of FAANGs in the last decade has probably trounced all tech ever since its inception. Even tradition industries will accelerate as well. 

As for interest rates, even if interest rates rise 0.5% in this coming year, i dont really think it's going to do much when the major players have so much retained earnings that they are resorting to insane stock buybacks. EV pipe dreams may not get so outlandishly priced like TSLA, but most of the core american economy probably won't flinch. 5% versus 4% interest rate never stopped anyone from buying a cheeseburger, XBOX, F150, or new home.",ktn699,9,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n3lf3b/indicators_relative_to_the_impending_market/gwqxrn7/,0.132,0.687,0.181,0.9599

1053,GME," In 2019 GMEs market cap was 300million or something, while Michael Burry calculated that their net assets were worth over 1 billion.
So it was priced at 3$ but it was definitely worth much more.

Secondly, their revenue was 6.4 billion, while their total costs were 6.7 billion. The costs were so high because they needlessly wasted a ton of money on an airplane and too many stores. With a few tweaks they could've easily turned a profit over 500million

Lastly, the gaming market is much bigger than games, so it's a little bit simple to only look at games.

‚ÄúIn October 2020 we set an aggressive schedule to complete development of our A-Sample in the April timeframe. I am proud of our talented team, their dedication and their ability to execute,‚Äù said Sumit Sharma, Chief Executive Officer of MicroVision. ‚ÄúI believe our differentiated, high-performance lidar sensor has the potential to advance autonomous driving and active safety systems beyond current sensors announced in the automotive market. I expect that a version of this lidar sensor could be available for sale, in initial quantities, in the third or fourth quarter of 2021,‚Äù continued Sharma.

‚ÄúWith an expected range of 250 meters and a field of view of 100 degrees horizontal by 30 degrees vertical, we expect this lidar sensor to provide the highest resolution point cloud at 10.8 million points per second while operating at 30 hertz. Additionally, this lidar sensor is designed to be immune to interference from sunlight and other lidars. One of the ground breaking proprietary features of this lidar sensor is its capability to output the axial, lateral and vertical velocity of moving objects at 30 hertz,‚Äù added Sharma. ‚ÄúWe believe no lidar product on the market, ranging from frequency modulated continuous wave to time-of-flight, has this capability. To achieve safety and successful autonomous driving, we believe this capability delivered at low latency will be a key feature.‚Äù

I agree with you in that if no products are being developed, or they don‚Äôt show up in their ‚Äúproduct roadmap‚Äù, then this company is purely based off speculation. However, with a product already developed, already in testing phase, it‚Äôs just a few more months until we start seeing MVIS release products to large automotive manufactures pursing autonomous driving.

1318,DD," Not too much in terms of DD for this play -- but I've been a pretty active trader for the past year, doing several intraday traders per day. One thing I've seen a trend on is mega cap names for the past few quarters having a big run into earnings.   


$DIS is set to report earnings on May 14th, it recently was sitting at $203 / share and dropped back down to $182 last week...around this time I started to buy, a lot of calls and some shares. I favored calls for this to give myself more leverage because I was highly confident that Disney would run in the next few weeks. I think with the parks opening up and the momentum of Disney + this has a chance to get back over $200 before earnings.   


Now what I've seen with many of the other mega caps, if they rip into earnings...and sometimes really rip in the AH. But the next day they just dropp off a cliff.

1350,TSLA, I don't own NKLA but it looks very juicy right now for the picking. I'm hesitant because I am loaded up in TSLA already and don't really need this.

1351,NKLA," Everyone and their mom knows NKLA is a massive scam. OP must be either a massive bag holder or related to Trevor.   
How this company is still in existence and its executives (including that con artist Trevor) not in jail is beyond me.   
If there was ever proof of massive corruption in the market, this is it folks.",Stealth3S3,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n3wwlk/is_nkla_undervalued_or_insignificant_my_nikola/gwttj2k/,0.063,0.937,0.0,-0.5719
1352,ARE," Sometimes when a stock loses value it's better to leave it alone. Other times the low value is an opportunity. The fact that some people, or even many people, lost money with this stock does not mean it stops being a viable investment forever. Right now historically the price is low. And they ARE building a factory. Maybe it will end up in smoke, maybe it will start producing trucks. If it's mildly successful, the stock is undervalued.

1353,NKLA, Yes and OP is probably one of the cucks on the board trying to convince us to buy NKLA,Stockgandu,6,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n3wwlk/is_nkla_undervalued_or_insignificant_my_nikola/gwsbmg4/,0.0,0.783,0.217,0.5719
1354,NKLA," This isn't about math, it's about bringing across the problematic point of charging EV's (including any NKLA Ev's!). Most cars need more than an hour to charge, and most recharging stations (35 out of 40 thousand) don't have fast-charging technology. 

So a 4 hour drive with the need to charge, can significantly increase the travelling time, to the point that it isn't a good choice for people who need to travel distances.",biutifo,-1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n3wwlk/is_nkla_undervalued_or_insignificant_my_nikola/gwskion/,0.076,0.893,0.031,-0.5103
