My advice is hold the stock, maybe trim off some of the profit you made and hold some liquidity in your account for if/when the stock has any sort of big dip. Buying a big dip will quickly recuperate any losses in profits you may have incurred from the dip. And you can only do this if you have liquidity.

39,AAPL," the fundamentals right now is the entire tech sector is overvalued, and the speculation is that we’re inside a market bubble too. 

The point being, you can’t time these things. You really can’t. You’re either in the market or not, plain and simple. 

I’d say assess the situation and have a strategy if your ultimate end goal is to secure some profit. Historically, Apple shares have dropped after earnings reports, good or bad. And then they always recover and climb back up to higher highs, unless there’s an overall market correction/crash (which even then, see q4 2020 earnings and the following 6 months afterwards). 

If you bought at 120 and are happy with the profit you’ve earned now, secure it and don’t look back. Wait for the earnings report to drop and buy back in when you feel comfortable. 

But also, keep in mind this is Apple. A company that is worth something like 2.5Trillion in market cap alone. A company that sits on such a mountain of cash it could probably buy up neighbouring countries and still have enough fuck you money left over. A company that releases fantastic products with a cult-like following. 

Know the value of what you’re holding. While a trading/investment strategy should be present across everything you have, remember you also own one of the top dogs in the market. 

As for me, I own shares of AAPL (also at 120, go figure) and will patiently wait for after earnings dip to buy some more. I’m bullish as fuck on this company, regardless of what the “overvaluation” of things might be right now, because I know the company has outstanding potential even still.

Once inflation hits, the market will adjust the ratios and this giant will get assigned a lower ratio as they basically normally all do. So while apple will still be an amazing business, it will trade at a PE of 19-20 instead of 30, resulting in a current downside of 33%.

59,ATH," im completely new on the market.   
In my 20s I played the futures market every single day for years and made a killing, of course everyone was making money easily then.  
Ive gotten into about 50 positions, half of them are pot stocks which im definately holding on too, its a growing sector.  
Im seeing my biggest problem over the past 9 months since I got in is that I love to get some super hyped stuff at ATH, and I did not take profits on some smaller stocks when i was over 2x.  
Ive still got some pretty profitable positions that im hanging onto.

64,ATH," Tell that to Mike Lazaridis, Blackberry was seen as a company with an innovative foundation in it’s heyday. It took all of 4 years to take it from it’s ATH of ~$133 to sub ~$10 a share due to poor leadership in the C suite. 

Doesn’t matter how innovative a company’s foundation is if the leadership team chokes out innovation. Mike did just that, he ignored calls from his top innovators that they needed to compete with the iPhone by making the Blackberry more of a computer in your pocket. Mike swore that no one would want what the iPhone had to offer and that people only wanted to be able to answer email on their phone and that no one would ever want to use an on screen keyboard. Toward the end both Mike and Jim Balsillie received an anonymous letter from one of the top RIM (research in motion) employees. Here are some highlights of the letter:

'Almost every project is falling further and further behind schedule at a time when we absolutely must deliver great, solid products on time.'

‘Let’s obsess about what is best for the end user. We often make product decisions based on strategic alignment, partner requests or even legal advice — the end user doesn’t care.'

'When was the last time we pushed out a significant new experience or feature that wasn’t already on other platforms?'

Don’t underestimate how destructive a handful of bad decisions from the c-suite can be to a companies innovation.",alexmcg87,39,/r/stocks/comments/or38sw/bought_apple_at_121_its_now_149_time_to_sell/h6h52pp/,0.095,0.782,0.123,0.5945
65,AAPL," But in terms of profitability (albeit NOT in valuation), Apple looks a lot like a stable value stock. Huge profits, a dragons pile of cash, regular dividends and share repurchases. I’m not saying Apple stock “only goes up”; I’m just saying it doesn’t look particularly risky as compared to other stocks.

IE- Even if you believe inflation is coming I don’t see AAPL as an especially risky bag to be holding",kmartshoppr,5,/r/stocks/comments/or38sw/bought_apple_at_121_its_now_149_time_to_sell/h6gn6ld/,0.062,0.685,0.253,0.9444
66,TV," Apple's adaptation to the changing environment is already visible - they have shifted significantly to services over the past few years and it has paid off really well - they saw how successful Spotify is and launched a music service that quickly turned into one of the leaders in the area and now they are developing a TV service to take on Netflix. They also built the wearables market practically from scratch and are the undisputed leader in the area - it may be an anecdotal example but the majority of the wearable devices I see on a day to day basis are apple watches. They are not staying static, but are constantly evolving.

&#x200B;

Who knows, one day they may lose their edge, but for the foreseeable future (which for me is the next 5-10 years) I think they'll continue to do well as a business.

71,DD," I was looking this weekend for some safer stocks to diversify my portfolio a bit. Haven't done proper DD on any of these but some that I started looking into:

I started looking at dividend companies and there are a lot still paying a big dividend, and a lot of them have had p/e ratios get out of whack or interrupted and took on a ton of debt to keep issuing dividends which I'm kind of wary of. Especially if they're reliant on borrowing going into a period with some inflation and higher interest rates. So all of the companies above have nice debt/equity rates (below .5), p/e are manageable (all below 30 and most below 20), some have low dividends but all have a history of increasing them (most through both 2008 and 1999 crises), and most have an ok RSI value right now (TROW is the only one over 70).

You could invest in AT&T, though they will be cutting their dividend around mid-2022 after the split of their WarnerMedia happens. You can accumulate as much dividends from $T until that time comes and sell off if you believe that's the best choice.

If you can find a stock with low p/e, good d/e, pays a dividend, and grows then I think you've got a pretty good stock lol. Just depends what you're willing to trade off. 

If you were willing to look at things with a little higher p/es there's ADP (a little high) and VFC (very high but if you look at the projected earnings it comes back to earth).

America is in a unique position with regard to borrowing debt because they can pay back the debt more easily than other countries because they have a very liquid economy and most trade and debt financing is done with the American dollar.

There are many countries that are still paying back their debts owed to America from WWI and WW2, that’s almost a century ago.

211,UK," I’m a UK investor and I’m 19, so I think my advice might be of good use to you. 
I have five main tips for you. 
1. As someone above said, buy stocks from companies you use. If you drive, invest in General Motors, Ford etc, if you use tech, Amazon, Facebook, YouTube, Google, that sorta thing.
2. Diversify your portfolio 
Don’t invest in just one type of stock. Hold money in commodities and ETFs. This means that if the S and P 500 crashes, you’re not going to lose all your money. Aim for a 50/50 split so you have some money if the market crashes. 
3. Only invest what you can afford to lose
Fairly self-explanatory. If you can’t afford to lose $30, put in $20. Just use your common sense with it. 
4. Invest little and often
For myself, I only put in £5 (around $7 or something, not sure on the exchange rate 😅) when I can. If you find yourself with an extra few dollars, put it in a stock you already have. Your balance will start to see the difference over a few months. 
5. Hold your positions even if you see the stocks going down 
If you see your stocks going down, don’t sell off. It may seem tempting but the market will always recover. Look at the ‘Covid crash’ at March sorta time last year. It’s already back to where it was before then. It may take longer to go back up than you are expecting but selling in the short term may negatively impact your long term returns. Hold, hold, hold and hold. 
Sorry about the long post, hope this can help you on your way :)",michaels0510,10,/r/stocks/comments/ord4rr/investing_at_17/h6hjet3/,0.01,0.922,0.068,0.9398
212,TD," The most successful investors aren’t maniacs who need to be able to trade sitting on the toilet, so don't let the ads fool you. Your investing should ideally be infrequent and for the longer term (in the US, there is also a tax advantage to holding over a year).

If you are investing right, the vast majority of your time ’investing’ is reading and learning. Actually placing trades is a very, very small part of the picture.

I often think of what Usain Bolt said about his performance — ‘‘I train for four years to run for ten seconds.’’ Investing ought to be like that. In a way, not having a PC where you can drive yourself insane jumping from stock to stock is an advantage for you, not a handicap.

Your best option for a broker is certainly not Robinhood, Webull, or any of those mobile-only jokers. Please get a brokerage account from a proper broker like TD Ameritrade, Fidelity, or Charles Schwab, all of which also have mobile support. You can also buy over the phone.

The $2-5k is not a large sum of money to a bank, even if it seems that way to a teenager. Even the law, which is outdated and impractical, doesn’t require banks to look into anything under $10k. If you’re very worried, go into the branch and have a chat with a branch manager, and explain the situation so they aren’t caught unawares. That’s more for your peace of mind than anything.

Your greatest advantage is time. You’re 17. Your $5k growing at 8% a year will $200,000 at 65 even if you never add another penny and invest in broad-market ETFs. I am not saying you should, but I am saying that you should feel relaxed about your future, and not feel pressured or in a hurry to by any stock.

Not tons, because most people don't have options. And of those that do, most buy call/puts. And of those interested, it takes a lot to buy 100 shares of the big ones.

Then there's fewer shares where it's actually worth the premiums. I've sold calls on RKT a few times when IV spikes, but that's the rare case of a cheap stock, that I still want to own but don't mind selling above where I bought it, and can sell calls when IV is up. Most else, I'd rather just keep (spy, aapl, msft, etc).

For reference, you'll get like $7-14 a week on a non-inflated regular IV cheapish stock.... And you need to own 100 of them. And you need to watch them and spend effort on it.

3. Tax implications. If you get exercised you just created a taxable event every time you sell premium is a taxable event. So I most people recommend buying to close instead of letting your shares get hauled away.

276,AMD," Selling covered call: Imagine your house has a market value of $500K. You are willing to sell your house for $520K within the next 30 days. Your ""willingness"" is worth $5K in the market. Someone is interested and paid you $5K in security deposit to buy your house for $520K in the next 30 days. 1) Should 30 days expire without a purchase, you keep your house and that $5K. 2) Should the deal go through, you keep $5K and sell your house for $520K. 3) Should you back out, you buy back your ""willingness"" for more or less than $5K.

Here's a current example: AMD at $92.15 currently

You own 100 shares at $90 even.

Come Monday, you sell a covered call for 7/30 ""**expiration**"" at $99 ""**Strike**"" for 1.02.

**Premium**: 1.02 x100 shares = $102 in your pocket.

On Friday, 7/30 expiration:

1. If AMD closes at <$99, 100 shares return to you and you keep the $102
2. If AMD closes at >$99, your shares are sold at $99 for $9x100 = $900 + $102 for a total gain of $1,002.
3. Or you could buy back your sold **covered call contract**, but you'll have to pay market price--could be lower or higher than your initial 1.02 premium received.",RunningRainFireFlies,5,/r/stocks/comments/or3dfp/why_dont_the_majority_of_longterm_investors_sell/h6hk3h5/,0.021,0.907,0.072,0.7096
277,MSFT," I have some questions about this. I am relatively new to options and when i look at premiums, the risk-reward seems way off. But, clearly i must be missing somethng and would appreciate if you could clarify it for me.

Taking your example of Microsoft. Let's say i own 100 shares of it.
The price today on 26-Jul is around 290.
Let's go with 6-Aug call for a 10% higher strike price (approx 320).

The price for 6-Aug 320 Strike Call is 0.12 dollars.

The price for 27-Aug 320 Strike Call is 0.44 dollars.

The return is .04% to .15% for the two dates respectively.

Now, MSFT is a stable stock and a 10% jump is very rare but it feels like picking pennies in front of a moving road roller. Sure, most of the time i can earn between 12 to 44 dollars but one single good news for MSFT and i have to part with a valuable stock (and this is not even considering how lossy the trade can get if the markets really like the news).

Since i am new to options, perhaps, i am missing something here. How is the reward worth the risk even if the risk is low probability?

Yes. I sell mostly its cousin: cash secured put (CSP), but when I'm assigned 100 shares, I turn around and sell covered call.

E.g., last week I was assigned 45P on DKNG, so on Monday I sold a 7/23 46C for 0.77, but on Thur/Fri that contract was going for 2.80-3.20 bc DKNG was around $49. Left over $200 on the table but I already ""knew and agreed to this"" prior to playing this game.

297,ATH," The issue with that logic is doing that exposes you to much more risk tax wise as you would have to wait 30 days before reentering or else it would fall into the wash sale rule.

It sounds to me like you need to more thoroughly assess your overall trading strategy in these positions. If you are planning to buy and hold for multiple years then sure there is less harm buying in at the top. If you do that though you have to be prepared to hold through any short term fluctuations in price. If you buy intending to hold until 2023 but you panic sell on a 5% dip from earnings then you are acting against your own investment thesis and are doomed to fail. 


My general advice for entering any long position would be to look at the charts and identify a point of entry that you are comfortable with. When the stock hits that price enter your position and let your investment strategy run its course. Next look for a price to set a stop loss at. For example if you are bullish on a stock that is currently trading at an ATH identify a price you believe it could realistically retrace to and enter a limit order. Now that the price has already gone down from the ATH placing a stop loss below your entry has much less of a chance of being a mild correction and would more likely represent a trend reversal. The last thing I would suggest would be identifying a price that you feel if the stock were to hit in the short term would be high enough that it would be worth selling a portion of your trade to lock in profits. Doing this will take a lot of the uncertainty you may feel out of the equation when managing your portfolio and should allow you to follow your investment strategy much more consistently.",FinntheHue,1,/r/stocks/comments/or9q47/averaging_up_your_cost_basis_question/h6ie7i6/,0.1,0.832,0.068,-0.9341

Valuation:
$19b 

2021 Revenue:
$3.4b 

Cash On Hand:
$3.3b (cash +short-term investments + restricted cash) 

Business:
Develop & publish video games 

Bullish Description:
Best positioned for the PS5/Xbox Series X console cycle since they have a lower revenue base to grow off of and higher revenue mix of console games. Company's financials are moving towards other SaaS business models with more predictable, recurring revenue (MTX) that is also higher margin. That's important because SaaS stocks have a higher multiple for this reason. GTA 5 sold over 100 million copies and everybody is eager for GTA 6 to come out. 

Bearish Description:
Console cycle expansion is slower than expected and more gamers migrate to mobile formats, which isn't TTWO's strength. GTA 6 doesn't come out in time and their existing franchises mature or even churn gamers as competitors release more engaging games & entertainment. 

High risk: 
Have no fucking clue when GTA 6 comes out and more volatility to the downside if there are any delays, which I wouldn't be surprised given the scale of the game.

319,AI," Rhymes with ranodimension but starts with an “n”. 



The reason I am in this penny stock / microcap? Is because of the potential of their technology.

A 3d printing company with zero debt and $1.4B in cash on hand with patents of some of the most disrupting technology to come out in this space.

They 3d print electronic PCBs, so not microchips but the boards that allow them to talk to each other. They can also print electronic parts like inductors, capacitors, antennas in junction with their PCBs and can place other parts in situ. The printers runs 24/7 without oversight and self cleaning, and selling the inks is part of their razor blade and razors type business model as well as printing things in house on demand for those who can’t afford their own printer. 

Two of their recent acquisitions have technology that give me the chills thinking about them.

Enter Nano-fabrica and DeepCube. Nanofabrica has an advanced 3d printer capable of printing 10,000 mm^3 parts with nanometer resolution in a single run. 

DeepCube is a deep learning AI company that has won many awards for their tech. They specialize in deep learning which is self-teaching machine learning artificial intelligence. Their tech alone is worth the current shareprice in my opinion. They are the only company that can provide deep learning to edge type devices such as cell phones, drones, printers, cars. Currently, most AI must be connected to wifi or network somewhere and so they aren’t truly autonomous like they could be with DeepCube. 

DeepCube is going to be the AI oversight that will connect every single one of their printers to optimize every single thing from speed to saving ink etc. A self teaching AI with nanoscale resolution 3d printing electronics that gets better and better over time is on the horizon (two years). 

Cathie Wood owns 16M shares. 

So why is this risky? Well they are headquartered in Israel so threat of war is always there but also, they don’t sell a lot of their current printers. They just don’t make much money at the moment but have $1.4B cash in hands. Fear of bankruptcy is negligible. 

Also! They still have two Type A acquisitions left to announce. They are purchasing two PCB-manufacturers of around 100-150M in revenue per year each. They will buy them and slowly implement their technology into the supply chains. This should help lead to wider adoption of their tech and provide extra income for their future goals. I am excited for what their future tech brings. 

Again, a deep learning AI 3d printing electronics with nanoscale resolution. It’s trading just above their cash value. They are the only ones with the patent to print electronics.",IpsumProlixus,1,/r/stocks/comments/oregc7/whats_your_most_high_risk_high_reward_position/h6iembe/,0.051,0.814,0.135,0.9919

346,GME," Debt and cash are external to the enterprise value. All citing these numbers do is tell me it’s unlikely to go bankrupt in the next couple of years. It barely factors into the valuation. 

One might very well be bullish on the business (and I think it will probably do quite well, actually) but that doesn’t change the fact that the current valuation - taking into account all the needs to be done, the execution risk etc - is silly. 

Fundamentally you have a loss making bricks and mortar chain and a fledgling e-commerce business. You’re talking about having to execute on massive down sizing and restructuring of the legacy business and building up almost from scratch a new business. The existing bricks and mortar business is basically worth nothing. The nascent e-commerce business is not worth 12x sales. *Maybe* half that in the current market. And that’s a big maybe. 

Good management? Yes I agree very good management. Worth something, not billions. The rest of your thesis? Amounts to a nice strategy and some partnerships with decent potential. It’s all very well, but they have a very short track record of execution in GME and plenty of scope to screw up… when strategy starts to be worth billions frankly I start to think about exiting the market. 

I haven’t done a projection of future cashflows of this company to calculate the IRR of investing in it at current valuation. But I would expect making even optimistic assumptions that it would be in the low single digits at the maximum, which is an unacceptable payoff given the execution risk. 

When Cohen sold chewy he sold a fast growing $2bn revenue business at a 1.7 multiple. The company which shall not be named  is at something like a 12x multiple on e-commerce. Be as bullish as you want on the company, there is no payoff on a $12 billion bet.

382,AMC," >Every trade in the market has nearly an equal chance of reversing.

Perhaps in the short term all trades have a nearly equal chance of reversing. But this is most certainly not true in the long term. For an extreme example that demonstrates this: one person buys AMC in the morning and plans on selling it in an hour because they think it will go up. Another person buys VOO in the morning and plans on selling it in 20 years because they think it will go up. Which trade has more of a chance of making money? Of course it’s the long term trade in this case. AMC’s movement throughout the day is as good as random. VOO’s movement over two decades is very likely to be upward. And when I say “very likely” I mean that there has not been a single instance in the history of the stock market where the S&P 500 has gone down over a 20 year period, so it would be incredibly surprising for the second person to lose money. Is it possible? Of course. But is it just as likely as the first person losing money? No way.",theBRGinator23,2,/r/stocks/comments/orcwth/is_there_any_real_edge_in_actively_trading_unless/h6hler2/,0.063,0.859,0.079,0.3347

Lets stick with VOO,  Actively managing say a 100 share investment in VOO.  Selling on common sell triggers (This appears to be Vanguards version of SPY, so you can find plenty of strategies) would net you more than holding it (net taxes and ER/commissions.

Using Fri 7/23 on the 1 minute chart, I see 2 fantastic long opportunities, and 2 solid shorting plays. that would definitely profit more than the \~3$/share it gained over the course of the day.  That's not even attempting to capture the peaks.

384,AMC," It’s seems to me that now we’re talking about something different than what we started on. I was just saying before that it’s more likely for a single long term play in an ETF like VOO to make money than a single short term trade in a volatile stock like AMC. Now it seems like we’re talking about the amount of returns from actively managing these two.

Of course I agree that actively trading (if you are able to find good entry points) will make more than just holding. But before you said that virtually any trade has an almost equal chance of going up or down. If that’s really the case then how do you figure that you can make trades that go up more often than you can make trades that go down?

To clarify, I do not believe that every trade has an equal chance of going up or down. I do believe that a disciplined trader with a proper plan can find good trades enough to be profitable, but I don’t see how this belief is consistent with the belief that all trades have an equal chance of going up or going down.

She was selling off Tesla when it was close to $900 because it got overweight in her portfolio plus it was overvalued at current levels.

It's estimated that Valve makes about a billion per year before expenses (give or take a couple hundred million).

Unless it's DOTA, the games are somewhat inconsequential when it comes to the bottom-line for them. Artifact was an expensive flop, and HL: A was a relatively niche pet project for VR.

Walk through the electronics section at Wal-Mart and look at the hardware. Google, Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo, Samsung (pink sheet/krx), HP, etc... It's rare that you see a manufacturer that makes mass market expensive computers in stores everywhere and isn't publicly traded.

Let's just say Valve has... $8 billion in cash... a total guess. This is still a huge risk for them. Stepping into a whole new line of business, establishing an entirely new product category, manufacturing extremely complex products with super low margins at a massive scale... it doesn't matter if they have an $8 billion battle chest -- this is still a big risk for them to take. Gabe stressed just how difficult it was for them to hit these price targets as well, so the margins on this thing are likely razor-thin.

Valve isn't even trying to make money off the hardware they want to have a Google Play strategy where more devices support the Steam platform. Valve has the cash to make this play without going public. They don't need to make every single Steam Deck they just have to make demand. At least that's the current plan.

This only makes me realize just how risky this is. Valve has said that *their* Steam Deck is going to be selling in the ""many millions"". *Theirs*. All they're doing is making the SDK and Steam OS 3.0 open source for other manufacturers to do what they want with it, but they're not at all leaning on that for success and nothing has indicated that another manufacturer is even interested. They can't control what other people do. 

> Valve isn't even trying to make money off the hardware

Gabe said in an interview about the Index headset that something always needs to be profitable for them to pursue it. If there's as razor-thin margins as this device is clearly going to have, then they have no room to mess up. The reality is they'd likely let it fail for the reason of remaining private and not burning too much cash. 

> would you go public just to pump out a few extra hardware devices that you hope others will make anyway?
 
This is phrased in a disingenuous way in hopes it would slip by me and so it would legitimize your perspective. It's not just ""a few extra hardware devices"". Like, it's actually the complete opposite. Gabe said: they're going to be selling in the ""many millions"". This is going to be on the shelf next to the most popular gaming platforms at one point. Like, this is going to radically transform Valve as a company. 

> because you fundamentally don't understand the business strategy

I've expressed more of an understanding about their company, this product, the pricing strategy, the landscape, their strengths, their weaknesses, than anyone else in this thread. It's just a gaming-related topic, and gaming is mega toxic.

You really see a reality where you walk into a Best Buy and the four gaming platforms on the shelf are the PS5, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and the Steam Deck (which is likely going to happen) while there are 40+ million Steam Deck's in people's homes -- yet, Valve is still a small privately held company?
