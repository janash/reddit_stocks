85,EV," **Who want to bet on IT ?? This is my question**

2021 is becoming a tipping point for the electric vehicle (EV) industry. EV inventories are making huge gains, while traditional oil and gas companies are taking over. The popularity of EVs is having a trickle-down effect in the supply chain, which means great potential for battery inventories.

&#x200B;

Without batteries, there is no EV industry. Smart investors are increasingly interested in battery-related equities, including companies that extract and refine lithium-the key element in lithium-ion batteries. Lithium is often referred to as ""white gold"" or ""white oil"" in reference to its value and its central position in the green energy revolution. Voltabox offers batteries with the ability to easily integrate them into the vehicle chassis.

&#x200B;

The battery system manufacturer Voltabox has introduced a new technological concept that allows the production of lithium-ion batteries in almost every conceivable free form. This technological concept, called Flow-Shape-Design (FSD), is based on the solidification of plastic materials to enclose the battery.

&#x200B;

This innovative technology will allow the vehicle manufacturer to distribute the load ""weight"" to allow the point of gravity to be adjusted. This is to have a pleasant driving experience.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The market launch of the new technology is scheduled for summer 2021 when Voltabox wants to start delivering its own FSD modules and customer-specific FSD battery systems. In addition, the company aims to spread this technology through licenses in selected markets. For this purpose, they have filed several patents and have already protected utility models and trademarks. Discussions on the use of the technology are now gradually being initiated with customers, according to the manufacturer, who also expects to issue the first licenses to battery manufacturers and OEMs starting next summer.

&#x200B;

147,ALOT," Pro tip, don't buy a company based on the value of a single share. Look at market cap as the main information source regarding the valuation of a company. Many people seem to fail to recognise that value of equity = shares in circulation x share price. A company can infinitely dilute and undilute a share price by buying back or selling more shares. 

Some people use tech analysis which does work to a certain extent, albeit a self fulfilling prophecy rather than anything magical. 

There isn't a huge amount to learn. A lot of concepts in finance have three letter abbreviations but are easily understood with simple examples. Everytime you don't understand a word google it. 

Professional traders have models to analyse risk and price companies. You won't get to that level without formal education or ALOT of time invested in your part. Focus on qualitative analysis and learn to identify the bullshit.",_herbie,39,/r/pennystocks/comments/lavhzq/a_question_to_the_serious_penny_stock_traders/glq957h/,0.074,0.824,0.102,-0.1358
148,DD," If you’re looking for long term, find a company that is low enough for you to buy a large amount of shares in, and that YOU truly believe in. (Product, business plan, expected growth) ask yourself.. where do I see this company in 5 years and why? Can I keep this money tied up for that long or longer? Sometime with low low penny stocks the charts don’t matter as much as their true business plan. Go out and do your DD and conquer. Unlike recent events, growth takes TIME. I’ve traded for 6 years now and have just started getting into consistent gains and finding cheap companies I actually have faith in. *not an advisor just stating what has helped me.

149,DD," I learned from some very talented investors and this is for any stock, real estate or investment known to man. Buy when it's cheap and sell when it's expensive. I'm not saying this is easy. But I see too many people mostly worried about how many shares they can buy and the share price. It doesn't matter how many shares you own and the share price is irrelevant. If it's 5 cents or $1,000 all that matters is whether it's cheap or expensive. How you come to that conclusion is investing time in DD. Not only understanding the individual company inside and out but the big picture of what market/vertical they are in. You will not hit a home run everytime. Even if you get 6 out of 10 right and are in the black at the end of the day that's all that matters. The other thing is control your portfolio allocation. Invest most of your portfolio in solid longterm stocks with preferably a dividend. Only use like 10% of your budget on high risk stocks.

I like things that people use everyday, and will continue to use over a 5-10 year time frame. Stocks I have include Tesla, Lemonade, FuboTV, and Crowdstrike. I leave a little cash, between 5-10k to have a little fun with playing with penny stocks and short term stocks, but this is a small percentage of my portfolio. I only use money I would not lose sleep over if I lost it.

I used to only try to day trade. I held thousands of NIO for a week or so, when it was under $3. I have Tesla for a few months when it was under $100. Dont even ask me about my short Bitcoin holding pre-$250. So much money was lost by day trading for a quick buck or two, and not holding for life changing gains.

The way I do my trading, is 50% safe (example SPY) 45% medium safe - a company that is more volatile but I believe in (I have Bep, Bam, MFC, Rnw, Rei etc), and then about 5% towards riskier stocks like any weed stocks and a sprinkle of pink sheets for shits and giggles, because you never know... but that is almost same level as gambling. 
Dividends are a percentage that is given by some companies (the amount varies) to their shareholders. So, the example I have above was BEP, they give me 11% every year based on how many shares I own (in my case, that’s  $1368 a year, that I then reinvest). In other words, I bought some Bep at around $19, they have since gone up to $59ish, but have also paid me dividends every year.

They were able to get an offering in before releasing that, though.

He’s not going to tell you that the FDA isn’t going to accept the vaccine trial in India, because their demographics do not match the US population — something that the FDA has repeatedly stressed as a necessity.

But what do I know? I’ve only been tracking vaccine development for the last 8 months.

From the [FDA guidance “Development and Licensure of Vaccines to Prevent COVID-19”](https://www.fda.gov/media/139638/download)

>”FDA encourages the inclusion of diverse populations in all phases of vaccine clinical development. This inclusion helps to ensure that vaccines are safe and effective for everyone in the indicated populations.

>* **FDA strongly encourages the enrollment of populations most affected by COVID-19, specifically racial and ethnic minorities.**

Edit:

As [noted by FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-offers-guidance-enhance-diversity-clinical-trials-encourage-inclusivity-medical-product),
> ...we must encourage developers of any medical product such as treatments or **vaccines for COVID-19** – as well as medical products more broadly – to endeavor to include diverse populations to understand their risks or benefits across all groups.

>
>To further promote and protect public health, it is important that **people who are in clinical trials represent the populations most likely to use the potential medical product.**",4ppleF4n,2,/r/pennystocks/comments/lawwbt/ocugen_and_bharat_biotech_officially_announce/glr27p6/,0.027,0.8,0.172,0.983

You can do chart plays using technicals and looking for reversals and breakouts (search for technical analysis tutorials on the internet), hold long on a company you’ve researched and believe can grow over time, or try and ride catalysts that you find promising. Some more fringe strategies include trying to ride hype or P&Ds, but for these you’ll need really good intuition and experience (or luck) or you will lose money. Some lazy strategies include picking up low RSI (10-30) shares or setting very low B/Os and waiting patiently until they fill.

567,AM," So this morning around 11 AM EST many people were having difficulty buying HCMC shares because of the high volume. Some people had to try several times before getting their trades to go through, others had to buy their shares in small amounts, and the rest tried to call the company they do trades with (Fidelity, etrade, etc.). At the end of the day most of the major trading platforms were accepting trades again but there are a few companies, [TD](https://www.reddit.com/r/HCMCSTOCK/comments/lak0q4/td_is_halting_hcmc_because_it_is_too_risky_of_a/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) to name a few, who are halting trading of this stock. 

Something else to keep in mind is that if you deposited your funds into your account today or Friday, you may have to wait 1-3 business days for your funds to clear before you can buy the stock. Many of the people who had problems buying the HCMC stock today, couldn't by the stock because their transfer was not completely processed yet.

671,DD," trading and investing are two different things. trading is like catching a nice surf wave and investing is scheduling a route to cross the atlantic ocean. for daily trading (personal opinion) you don't need a deeper DD and research. You just catch the sentiment and you go with the flow, if it peaks for half a day then fine. Unorganic/Artificial pumps with rumors etc. is trading's bread and butter. Investing is a long run.

726,UAVS," >I believe that both these companies are great. However from these figures ALPP looks insanely undervalued, or UAVS is overvalued. Am I missing something big about ALPP that is reducing its share value or is it just limited by its market?

ALPP is still vastly undervalued but this is not new info. This has been known since last year when it was comparing favorably in terms of revenue and growth to companies trading in the $10-$15 range on major markets while sitting below 10 cents. And it's still undervalued now for its revenue.

Why you ask? Well, that's the answer to the ""is it limited by its market?"" question.

ALPP is OTC

UAVS is NYSE

Broader market access = more buyers, more money, more bank support, and more.  UAVS has those things, while ALPP does not.

ALPP is a $10-$15 valued company now (if not more due to the recent acquisitions). But being on the OTC is holding it back. Hence the need for an uplist in whatever way.",Noexit007,10,/r/pennystocks/comments/lafnfz/alpp_and_uavs_revenue_float_and_share_price/glnsauw/,0.029,0.842,0.129,0.9599

751,DD," Noticed that too. There's a lot left to clean up from the old management group (like convertible notes, related party notes, and going concern issues), but now we're close to launching the new suite of products under VirExit and actual revenue generation. 

I believe it has a much greater likelihood of success at cash-flow generation compared to the average OTC launching a new line of products because of the resumes of those involved. I mentioned Jim Katzaroff, but they also brought in Patrick Netter to handle marketing of this launch. Frankly, he's a bit of a weirdo who brands himself as a marketing ""guru"" (hate that term), but his connections and resume look strong. Check the DD link in my post for more info. 

Also, people should be smart and take incremental profits along the way. I believe this will go up significantly, but I have already taken a healthy amount of profits and am riding free shares.

753,DD," That's my best reasonable estimate. It comes from a mixture of trading experience in the OTCs, having followed PVDG since July, the technicals over the last 90 days, the original DD about individuals involved, and the company ultimately delivering on 2 sets of financial statements (8/31/20 and 11/30/20) in the last 24 hours to remove the stop sign on OTCM. I think we're an attorney letter away from a yield sign. They were also transparent on Twitter without jumping the gun starting in December. 

I believe that we are at the beginning of this company's operating, cash-flow-generating life. There's an entire product launch and PR campaign to come after we go from stop sign to yield sign, yield sign to Pink Current, then change name/ticker to VirExit. Of course I could be wrong about exact timing since I was wrong about how long financials took (mainly due to OTCM processing turnaround time in a pandemic), but I expect all of this to culminate in February at the current rate. 

At minimum, this is going up above 3 cents very soon, and I just bought more at .0229. [Here's proof](https://i.imgur.com/stNhan3.png). You'll see I also put more in yesterday.

July 24, 2018

Dear Hearing Aid Manufacturer: 

In section 709 of the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017 (FDARA), Congress enacted a definition, outlined certain requirements, and set forth a process for establishing a category of over-the-counter (OTC) hearing aids and the requirements that apply to them. That statutorily mandated process provides for FDA to publish proposed regulations by August 18, 2020, to consider public comments, and then to publish final regulations within 180 days of the close of the comment period. Section 709 also includes a preemption provision stating that no state or local 
law can be different from, in addition to, or not identical to, the regulations that FDA will establish for OTC hearing aids under authority of FDARA. 

Section 709 reflects a careful balance between consumer access to new technologies and consumer protections to assure the safety and effectiveness of OTC hearing aids. The protections include output limits, appropriate labeling, advisements about when to consult with a licensed health care practitioner, and guidance on when premarket review by FDA would be required.

Section 709 is not self-implementing, meaning that the OTC hearing aid category, as defined by FDARA section 709, does not exist until the effective date of a published final regulation. Until that time, no products that are claimed to address hearing loss are, or can claim to be, OTC hearing aids within the meaning of FDARA section 709.

Currently, hearing aids continue to be restricted devices, for which sales must follow applicable federal and state requirements. FDA has published a guidance document stating that the agency will not enforce the requirement for a medical evaluation or waiver under 21 CFR 801.421, but manufacturers should be mindful of any similar state law requirements. 

If you have questions about this communication, please contact the Division of Industry and Consumer Education (DICE) at DICE@FDA.HHS.GOV 800-638-2041 or 301-796-7100.

Great product that I strongly expect to be FDA approved.  Gary Rubin is running the trials of their new stent and he is kind of the guy in that field.  Lots of insider buying in that last few months along with several hires with backgrounds in having their company acquired by one of the big boys.  Great long term future.

So why'd I sell?  An offering is coming at an unspecified date followed possibly by a reverse split.  Offering looks to be at market price and will dilute the shares about 25%.  There is a vote in March to determine whether to do the reverse split.

FDA approval is months away at least.  Not even sure if clinical trials for CGuard (their new stent) have started, but they have approval to begin.  

I'll jump back in after the offering closes and reverse split is resolved.  I suppose there is a small chance I miss out on this one by selling, but I feel good about waiting until after March.",UMHB_Prof,2,/r/pennystocks/comments/laegn0/nspr_over_the_next_6_months/glnrl09/,0.018,0.85,0.132,0.9605
