128,CLOV," I'm not going to count on the Medicare expansion passing, they're already trying to do too many things and with the senate the way it is I doubt this kind of thing would pass right now. If it does happen then that would be a massive positive. CLOV is growing their patient population very rapidly right now and I like a lot of the initiatives they've been pushing for, providing in home visits, proactively helping provide transportation for patients to go see their physicians, etc. so I think once all these pretty great new initiatives of theirs become more widely known their growth will be able to continue at an incredible pace. I think it's premature to try and figure out an exact number for how much of the population they could capture, they're still only in a few states so just geographic expansion over time will be a large part of helping them capture more of the pie.",bittabet,5,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o672a9/clov_detailed_dd/h2sacdk/,0.015,0.845,0.14,0.9578
129,CLOV," Thanks for the response. It seems plausible, but like you mentioned “building the bridge” is a more arduous process to execute than it is to talk about. Although I’m a clinician in title, I do a decent amount of multi institutional research (mostly retrospective and admittedly niche in cancer) and using things like CareEverywhere for EPIC or Allscripts data is just simply not possible due to the lack of confidence in the data put in (I.e garbage in, garbage out). 

If CLOV is able to bridge that gap it would be extremely helpful, but I do think it would take a long time. 

Of note, I think some health systems might be less inclined to give access to data with all the recent breaches. Mayo Clinic was the only center that truly impressed me with their infrastructure to fight against cyber attacks, but most others are weak in this arena.",pharmacykiller33,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o672a9/clov_detailed_dd/h2sdpen/,0.084,0.77,0.146,0.8908

Then you'd be spending days on end trying to figure out over the phone with these guys who broke what.

Like I said, it's still a fair amount of work to interface, but it's already way less painful than it used to be. The reason I used to train clinicians on using EHR was that I used to implement EHR systems before I became a physician myself.

But yes, making sure that the data is what you expect it to be is a big part of being able to leverage that data to improve healthcare with their AI.

McDonald's literally sells edible poison that causes heart disease and diabetes. Tesla sold cars that actually exploded. What about Microsoft? Remember the Windows phone? There are tons of companies that manufacture and sell crap, yet are extremely popular and profitable.  WISH is not the products they sell, they are an e-commerce marketplace, that is their business, that is where their value is. WISH is gaining marketshare by the minute in the developing world.

651,IMO," You've gotta look at alot of these users who post like OP. They could very well be someone involved in the business of marketing Wish. Ever since the name has been dropped here, it's seemed fishy. 
I personally wouldn't touch it but as I said in my last post, there's a chance money could be made. There's a Good chance, but don't expect to see what you saw with other meme stocks or something like Amazon. 

IMO, it's definitely NOT something to hold with. This IS WallStreetBets after all, so if you feel like betting some money for a chance to gain SOMEthing, then go for it. 

Nothing is a sure thing and again, I wouldn't put my money into it (especially almost 100% like OP has, which makes them suspicious), so if you do decide to, make sure it's an amount you can afford to lose.



Edit: so like the other comment said: it's the poor man's Amazon. Their products are ususually Chinese made cheap imitations of legitimate products. I've bought from them before and each item I got (except for shoes) was complete garbage that broke extremely quickly or was curved (when supposed to be straight) or out of alignment (woodworking tools I wanted to try).

1103,DD," Good analysis. The only point I take issue with is the comparison to Logitech. Logi is taking a deep dive into the video conferencing world with their Rally systems. They are solid systems that run soft codecs on either a NUC or dedicated user PC. They utilize far-end content sharing, a proprietary camera with voice tracking and mic/speaker system. The price point is attractive compared to similar solutions from Cisco or Vaddio, so I believe their market share will continue to grow in this space. 

This will be their main source of innovation moving forward and a substantial percent of their business in 5 years. I do not believe it is an apples to apples comparison.

1111,CRSR," Account 2 months old and first seen in WSB 3 weeks ago should be ringing alarm bells for you retards. Theres three huge flaws in the DD which OP failed to mention. 

1/ Eagletree who own around 60% of CRSR are obligated to liquidate their position to around 10% over the coming years. That means as soon as CRSR has any sort of spike or gain, you can bet these fuckers are just going to pass bags to you. 

2/ The ""Technical Analysis"" is literally a crayon line. That's it. OP clearly ate half the pack of crayolas before attempting to look at any chart. Before the huge pump and dump (which is definitely having a negative sentiment to this stock) CRSR got rejected at the 20, 50 and 100 EMA three times. Now I don't know about you, but to me, that's a huge red flag indicating more downside.

3/ CRSR gave forward guidance that the last two quarters of this year we're going to be worse than the first two as things re-open and people move back away from gaming to doing things like going out more. This could be a nothing burger, but still warrants a mention.

If you're thinking, CRSR was at 42 just a week ago, it'll go back, ask yourself why it even went to 42 with zero catalysts and has dumped ever since back to it's lows.

People (on WSB especially) are always personifying Wall Street as if it's this hive mind organism acting consciously to screw over the retail investor.  I just don't think this is how it functions.

Why would Wall Street want to avoid giving the impression that they are loading?  What benefit would that give them?

That said, Mat has balls, seems to be aware of how to navigate the coming market place as stimulus ends and rates rise, and he is determined to be #1 within the next 2-3 years, so I'm in.

1437,UWMC," With an MSR business, they essentially have the ""right"" to collect fees since they ""service"" mortgages. That means they'll collect payments, potentially put them through the foreclosure process and cover the costs (potentially make a profit), etc. So they would earn some sort of basis point on the outstanding of the principal of the mortgage.  
  
So the rights end when a mortgage is refinanced (which is what we witnessed in the falling interest rate environment). In essence, the income stream are actually less when rates are low, and longer when rates are rising. If you look back during the housing bubble, in 2007, MSRs could've been valued at as much as 6X annual fees. However, when the bubble burst, they were about 2X as much.  
  
It's very perplexing how this isn't getting priced in. The company even mentioned they're forecasting growth / stability in the coming quarters.

For the short-term view, there's also the Russell Index Addition on Friday, and short increased significantly WoW (about a 15% increase as of yesterday's close). It's becoming hard to borrow at some places, and I wouldn't be surprised if the borrow rate skyrockets in the coming days.

1518,FSD," There are still reasons in 2021. F is delivering and may become a credible challenger - the Mach-E is underwhelming if you ask me, although it does many things right. The F-150 seems better. They are learning and adapting. That's dangerous for Tesla. A lot of the bullish movement was predicated in the established players being too slow to adapt. 

Then there's the perception that the stock is overvalued. It either is or isn't - and that depends on how you look at it. It's overvalued for a car company, but if one sees it as a tech company that happens to make cars, there's still plenty of room to grow. 

There's also the recent difficulties in China. Etc. 

Plenty of reasons.  A lot hinges on full self driving and they have the most interesting approach - and the most data. If they finally deliver, it's game over. LIDAR based crap with those warts poking out the top won't be accepted by the public. Nor will tech that relies on building maps. 

If they take too long to deliver FSD this will probably start chipping away at the stock price.

1548,PRPL," Surely - first I'll say that I was aware of this previously, but I remember it being sort of ""written off"" in my mind a year (?) ago or so...  I believe PRPL addressed this in a call and it became apparent that the tax expense was ""non-cash"" and that free cash flow was a non-issue. I don't think free cash is an issue today either. As someone playing the stock and not being heavily ""invested"" or looking for direct cash back from the investment, I think it's OK for me.

Now to actually look at this objectively, I'll say a couple of things that I think about this...

1. Public shareholders don't fully realize the value of positive tax specifics of companies. Likewise, they don't discount the value of a company completely for payments like this. However, I don't think it's because they don't care; I think rather that they don't fully understand (me included to a point). 
2. The implications of this TRA are negative to shareholders, most of which are institutional. They are clearly betting on growth outpacing the obligations of this agreement. For small fish and especially those of us playing with fire (options), the implications are even less critical.  The stock will go up as the business grows, even if shareholders see less direct return. For my calls, that's all that matters.
3. Financials only moving up recently... Even with this ""looming"" over the stock....
   1. Adjusted EBITDA up 115% YOY Q1
   2. Revenue up 52.3& YOY Q1
   3. Gross Margin improved by 3.4%
   4. Operating expenses held constant
   5. Adjusted net income $0.17 per share, up from $0.08 per share
   6. Cash on hand remains over $100 million
   7. Cash on hand was down some YOY due mainly to $12+million on expansion project(s)

  
Largely spitballing here, but I guess my main point is that I don't see it as a huge deal. Even on the sheet it's a relatively small item in the grand scheme of things.

This is the guy who tried the kill the GME short squeeze before it began.

And then spent the whole squeeze urging people to take their profits (""take the home run, don't hold out for the grand slam"").

He's also been constantly pushing the narrative that WSB is a single colluding entity. He's in large part responsible for this new idea that WSB is a coalition that works as a team to manipulate the market.

No it was not. GME wasn't even the most popular meme-stock at the time. GME happened for many reasons - WSB was a factor, but Ryan Cohen buying in and giving the company a new direction was a bigger factor. The biggest though, was just that the stock was overshorted (103%) and instead of caving when the price started to rise, the shorts doubled down (all the way to 143%).

1607,CBD," There is an opioid crisis and just from my limited, but positive experience with using Cannabis based pain reliever for my husband rather than an opioid, there is room to grow this market. It will be at the expense of opioids. Opioids are different from other pain medications. Opioids go directly to the brain and then bind to opioid receptors. Opioids alter the receptors so you don't perceive pain.  
  
Many people get a high from opioids the first time they take it. If they continue to take it, the brain will eventually crave that high. Other pain medications go to the pain and attack the pain. That's why opioids are so addicting--it is altering something within your mind. Simply put: opioids tell your brain there is no pain; other painkillers go to the pain. The elderly are particularly vulnerable to being prescribed opioids and for extended periods of time. Patients who have used opioids for over two weeks should have a schedule set up by their doctor to wean them off--that is how addicting the prescription opioids are. In 2019, the CDC reported over 13,000 deaths from prescription opioids.

Only posting because I'm a recent convert after my husband was hit in a crosswalk and drug 20 feet under the car. Opioids were prescribed and he was a nut--talked all night to friends who were not there. Gave him the dog's CBD and it made his pain manageable and gave him relief to rest without hallucinations.

I always hear ppl talking about how their family has driven fords since Christ walked the Earth etc. Or GM or Toyota whatever. They tend to stay loyal. Ive owned several ford trucks but I'm not necessarily one of those types. I do like the Ford Lightning because it looks like an actual truck and not a artistic render like the cyber truck, but GM Sierra's 1500s are probably the sexiest trucks I've ever seen as far as function and comfort. 

Truth be told, Im not personally loyal to anyone except for, whoever has a truck setup to where I can charge the truck from a solar array ontop of my travel trailer is gonna have my business. Be it a backfeed plug on the bumper next to the 7 pin connector or something.

So Ford has a bit of good will to get back. 

Now is the time though, because Tesla is shitting the bed by removing features and canceling products via tweets etc.

I wouldn't bet against Tesla or even really say they are overvalued (they own a huge network of charging stations, are going after the delivery truck market, solar and home batteries etc.) , but money in F (especially LEAPS) is super solid.

1635,GT," Unfortunately your charge times are wrong. 

While it is true you do have to locate the superchargers, it is what it is in an emerging market. When the horse and cart was replaced by the automobile I'm sure people had heaps of complaints about the automobile at the time too. Looking for the superchargers is not very hard in comparison to maintaining an automobile during their inception period. 

As for dealerships and service centers, you need to crunch the numbers and actually think to yourself what is the value of a relationship with a customer vs the overhead costs involved. If Tesla is able to create a good enough product, the cars will just sell themselves. I mean look at Porsche cars, their brand and sports car heritage is so powerful, their 911 GT cars are sold out as soon as they are released. They actually don't need dealerships to sell those. The Dealerships are only there to sell the more run of the mill models like base 911, Caymans, Boxster, Macan etc. If you can get a product good enough it doesn't matter.",superhappykid,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o634h7/comparing_tesla_to_ford_stock_tesla_is_far/h2qp5mi/,0.046,0.824,0.129,0.9391

1769,RKT," It's not just that. It's that keeping Fannie and Freddie under government conservatorship means that the Biden administration can continue to impose its favored social views via Fannie and Freddie's underwriting and loan purchase requirements.

Don't overlook that as part of this morning's ruling, the Supreme Court also held that the White House has greater constitutional authority to remove and replace the head of the Federal Housing Finance Authority (the FHFA),  than the authorizing statute purported to provide. The FHFA is the regulator (and administrator of the government conservatorship) for Fannie and Freddie.

On the heels of the Court's decision, the Biden administration announced that [it's going to replace the head of the FHFA](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-issues-mixed-ruling-on-government-seizure-of-fannie-freddie-profits-11624459222)).

>Though \[current head of the FHFA\] Mr. Calabria  pushed aggressively to end the companies’ dozen years under government control, the Biden administration has signaled it would be in no rush to end the companies’ so-called conservatorships. That could mean using the companies to address key policy priorities, such as closing the racial homeownership gap.

Does that sound familiar? It should.

You will recall that in the run up to the subprime crisis Barney Frank, one of the key legislators with oversight authority over Fannie and Freddie, said [""I want to roll the dice a little bit more in this situation toward subsidized housing.""](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2011/12/hey-barney-frank-the-government-did-cause-the-housing-crisis/249903/) By that, he meant he wanted the government to use its authority, through Fannie and Freddie, to force lower underwriting standards in housing finance as a means of advancing (or conforming with) preferred social views.

>\[Frank's\] most successful effort was to impose what were called ""affordable housing"" requirements on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 1992. Before that time, these two government sponsored enterprises (GSEs) had been required to buy only mortgages that institutional investors would buy--in other words, prime mortgages--**but Frank and others thought these standards made it too difficult for low income borrowers to buy homes. The affordable housing law required Fannie and Freddie to meet government quotas when they bought loans from banks and other mortgage originators.**

The Biden administration wants to try that again.

That's good news for mortgage brokers, like RKT and UWMC, because it signals that Fannie and Freddie, by weakening their underwriting and FHA qualifying loan requirements, will be used to buy up even more loans from even less creditworthy borrowers, all with the (now) explicit backstop of the Federal government. Again, from the same Atlantic article:

>It is certainly possible to find prime mortgages among borrowers below the median income, but w**hen half or more of the mortgages the GSEs bought had to be made to people below that income level, it was inevitable that underwriting standards had to decline. And they did.** By 2000, Fannie was offering no-downpayment loans. By 2002, Fannie and Freddie had bought well over $1 trillion of subprime and other low quality loans. Fannie and Freddie were by far the largest part of this effort, but the FHA, Federal Home Loan Banks, Veterans Administration and other agencies--all under congressional and HUD pressure--followed suit. This continued through the 1990s and 2000s until the housing bubble--created by all this government-backed spending--collapsed in 2007. As a result, in 2008, before the mortgage meltdown that triggered the crisis, there were 27 million subprime and other low quality mortgages in the US financial system. That was half of all mortgages. Of these, over 70% (19.2 million) were on the books of government agencies like Fannie and Freddie, so **there is no doubt that the government created the demand for these weak loans; less than 30% (7.8 million) were held or distributed by the banks, which profited from the opportunity created by the government**. When these mortgages failed in unprecedented numbers in 2008, driving down housing prices throughout the U.S., they weakened all financial institutions and caused the financial crisis.",mortymotron,6,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o6gdpd/fannie_mae_and_freddie_mac_shares_dive_after/h2slp7z/,0.075,0.868,0.057,-0.9513

>Though \[current head of the FHFA\] Mr. Calabria  pushed aggressively to end the companies’ dozen years under government control, the Biden administration has signaled it would be in no rush to end the companies’ so-called conservatorships. That could mean using the companies to address key policy priorities, such as closing the racial homeownership gap.

Does that sound familiar? It should.

You will recall that in the run up to the subprime crisis Barney Frank, one of the key legislators with oversight authority over Fannie and Freddie, said [""I want to roll the dice a little bit more in this situation toward subsidized housing.""](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2011/12/hey-barney-frank-the-government-did-cause-the-housing-crisis/249903/) By that, he meant he wanted the government to use its authority, through Fannie and Freddie, to force lower underwriting standards in housing finance as a means of advancing (or conforming with) preferred social views.

>\[Frank's\] most successful effort was to impose what were called ""affordable housing"" requirements on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 1992. Before that time, these two government sponsored enterprises (GSEs) had been required to buy only mortgages that institutional investors would buy--in other words, prime mortgages--**but Frank and others thought these standards made it too difficult for low income borrowers to buy homes. The affordable housing law required Fannie and Freddie to meet government quotas when they bought loans from banks and other mortgage originators.**

The Biden administration wants to try that again.

That's good news for mortgage brokers, like RKT and UWMC, because it signals that Fannie and Freddie, by weakening their underwriting and FHA qualifying loan requirements, will be used to buy up even more loans from even less creditworthy borrowers, all with the (now) explicit backstop of the Federal government. Again, from the same Atlantic article:

>It is certainly possible to find prime mortgages among borrowers below the median income, but w**hen half or more of the mortgages the GSEs bought had to be made to people below that income level, it was inevitable that underwriting standards had to decline. And they did.** By 2000, Fannie was offering no-downpayment loans. By 2002, Fannie and Freddie had bought well over $1 trillion of subprime and other low quality loans. Fannie and Freddie were by far the largest part of this effort, but the FHA, Federal Home Loan Banks, Veterans Administration and other agencies--all under congressional and HUD pressure--followed suit. This continued through the 1990s and 2000s until the housing bubble--created by all this government-backed spending--collapsed in 2007. As a result, in 2008, before the mortgage meltdown that triggered the crisis, there were 27 million subprime and other low quality mortgages in the US financial system. That was half of all mortgages. Of these, over 70% (19.2 million) were on the books of government agencies like Fannie and Freddie, so **there is no doubt that the government created the demand for these weak loans; less than 30% (7.8 million) were held or distributed by the banks, which profited from the opportunity created by the government**. When these mortgages failed in unprecedented numbers in 2008, driving down housing prices throughout the U.S., they weakened all financial institutions and caused the financial crisis.",mortymotron,6,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o6gdpd/fannie_mae_and_freddie_mac_shares_dive_after/h2slp7z/,0.075,0.868,0.057,-0.9513

1773,AIG," There is a non zero chance for damages.

However, that slim probability is that it may be like AIG damages. So let's call it 50% chance for an AIG damages payout & 50% for a par payout. You get $25 or $0.01 or an expected value of $12.50.

If you accept this first distribution, then you can determine that the market is telling you that there 80% chance there will a decision that shareholders do not have any damages resulting in $0.00, but in the 20% chance they do decide that, there is a 50% chance it's $0.01 or $25.

Therefore,  $0 or basically $0 the market is pricing at a 90% probability. The remaining 10% is par or $25, thus the $2.50.

If you think the probabilities are wrong & you also factor in opportunity costs, you may arrive at a price where it makes sense to buy. Otherwise, at $2.50, you stand to lose $2.50 & make a 10x.

Is it worth it?

1774,ITT," >I think, since housing costs have increased faster than most other costs, you could say their need is greater than ever. And, since secondary mortgage markets have changed so much in the last 80 years, people interested in exposure to this market should go to the private market.  
>  
>I’m sure you would prefer to ignore the reasons and benefits for which these entities were created, but we’re facing a similar housing issue today as we did in the interwar years.

The housing issue we face today is that, nationally, there is a shortage in the supply of housing units, of all varieties.

But Fannie and Freddie don't increase the supply of housing or make housing, itself, cheaper. They increase the supply and lower the cost of *financing* for housing. This has the predictable effect of increasing demand and, with it, underlying asset prices, for housing.

Personally, I don't think it's good economic or social policy for the government to encourage people to become excessively indebted beyond what, under a responsible underwriting standard, their income or assets can reasonably or responsibly support, particularly when the collateral for that debt is the borrower's primary residence. The notion that we should just do this anyway because ""housing costs have increased faster than most other costs"" implicitly rests on the premise that (a) home ownership, as opposed to renting (what was once termed ""an ownership society"") is, per se, a positive good; and (b) housing values will always go up (or at least won't go down). Neither of those premises are true, which is why we ended up with millions of people facing foreclosure and host of other severely deleterious financial consequences barely more than a decade ago. 

Nor is any of this is a mystery. Lest you think I have it out for the little guy, let's look at student loans, where there is no underwriting at all. It's the same basic problem.

A supply (seats at colleges and universities) that is in short supply at growing at rates far lower than demand. Result: prices increasing (substantially) faster than inflation, making it increasingly costly (to the point of it being impossible) for average and lower-income people. But data shows that ""people with at least a bachelor's degree \[never mind what field or where they studied\] earn, on average, more than those with only a high school education!"" Desired policy: higher education is a per se good and anyone who can or wants to pursue higher education should be able to do so, regardless of cost. Solution: flood the market for higher education with (now) trillions of dollars in cheap student loans. Loan proceeds will be paid directly to universities, which have no responsibility whatsoever for either (a) educational or economic outcomes of, or (b) future repayments or defaults by, student borrowers. Consistent with both the stated policies of and their own institutions' financial interest in government-backed student loan originations, college ""financial aid"" offices (aka student loan brokerages)  tell prospective students and their co-obligor parents that higher education (never mind what or where) is the ""best investment you can make"".

Mysteriously, universities keep finding a way to spend all of this money on increasingly bloated staffs of highly paid educrat administrators (who now comfortably outnumber faculty) and luxury-styled accommodations and amenities for student residents (a personal favorite is the Texas Tech water park and lazy river). Equally mysteriously, college tuition and ""student fees"" keep rising faster than inflation. Solution: increase the annual individual borrowing cap on student loans to match! What could possibly go wrong?

Anyone who actually cares about the plight of massively overindebted student borrowers should find this arrangement appalling. If we're going to have government backed student loans at all (as opposed to a more limited pool of outright grants), the loans ought to be dischargeable in bankruptcy, just like any other debt (I could live with some limited waiting period of a few years, say 3-5, just to limit blatant gaming of the system). But they aren't dischargeable in bankruptcy because then the government wouldn't be able to garnish even the Social Security income of borrowers until they die (a practice that would land any private debt collector in jail), and would have to acknowledge the economic reality that its student loan ""assets"" are riddled with bad loans that are tantamount to grants.  

And it should go without saying that universities who receive the benefit of these loans -- whether Harvard or ITT Tech -- should have some skin in the game (I like 30%, but pick your number) for loan losses due to discharged or otherwise uncollectible student loan obligations.",mortymotron,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o6gdpd/fannie_mae_and_freddie_mac_shares_dive_after/h2ta3y6/,0.099,0.797,0.104,0.7003
