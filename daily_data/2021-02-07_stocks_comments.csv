7,DD," I have a theory. So the original DD was folks thinking the stock was way over shorted. We don't know the exact number, but we can safely assume it was over 100% of float a few weeks ago, which means all the institutions sold short under 20. The squeeze was talked about, then the hype and media attention pushed the stock up to 200, 300, then 400 hoping for a short squeeze. Did the squeeze happen? Did those shorts cover? We simply don't know. All the data we have is inaccurate and outdated. I'm seeing different posts every day saying different things. I think best we know based on the evidence is that some of the shorts probably covered, but there wasn't nearly enough volume or liquidity or change in the price for all the shorts to cover.

New evidence lately seems to indicate that new short positions may have been taken out when it shot up to the highs in the 200-400 range. I mean, why not? Surely it was going to fall back down again. So now, we know there's tons of short positions still open, but we just don't know exactly how many of where they are. However, I think that we can say with high likelihood is that all the shorts were taken out before the surge at <20, and after the hype, at >200.

So for the last few days the price has been floating steadily right in the middle of this range. We know shorts pay interest and can't hold for long periods of time - they eventually want to cover. As long as the price stays steady in the middle between the <20 shorts and the >200 shorts, they're going to hold. Eventually, the <20 shorts are going to realize the price isn't coming back down, and they're going to buy to cover to cut their loses and stop bleeding. The shorts >200 are eventually going to realize the price isn't going to go any lower, and they're going to buy to cover to capture their profits. All we need to do now is hold in this range and keep the price between the shorts, like a short sandwich, and eventually all those shorts will slowly cover over time, steadily driving the price upwards as a slow pace. This is waiting game now. Don't sell. Just hold on to your shares, and watch it steadily go upwards over time as all the shorts exit. Hold and embrace the short sandwich!",Phoyo,46,/r/stocks/comments/le7syu/gme_institutions_hold_177_of_float/gmb0wik/,0.036,0.883,0.081,0.9681
8,GME, My absolute favorite manipulation of this whole thing has got to be on Thursday when ‘they’ strangled the fuck out of GME down to $50 and Robin Hood announced no more restrictions right after. It was a big “fuck you” to retail investors and an open invitation for them to dump more money into the stock and ride it all the way down lining the hedge funds pocket the whole way. Such a god damn scam.,B00Mshakal0l0,28,/r/stocks/comments/le7syu/gme_institutions_hold_177_of_float/gmc8e2e/,0.225,0.718,0.056,-0.936
9,GME," Good info. I'm still not a believer yet (disclaimer: I bailed on GME already for a small profit).

In order for a squeeze to occur, you need more than shorted shares. You also need:

1. Margin calls on the short sellers, and
2. Those margin calls must force the short sellers to buy GME shares

At this point, this seems unlikely to me. Why? 

* Suppose all short sellers receive margin calls on their accounts. Will they be forced to buy GME shares? Unlikely. There are other, less costly options to satisfy the margin call. For example, they can sell off other positions, or they could receive a bailout (like the $2.7B bailout Melvin received from Citadel). They will use the cheapest possible option to satisfy their margin call.
* What do you think the average borrowed share price is for shorted shares currently? Before the $400+ peak on Jan 27, any short sellers had certainly borrowed shares at a low price (around $20, or less). Now? It's likely that some of those original short positions are closed, and new short positions opened at prices in the $200-$400 range. Those new short positions are now highly profitable for those short sellers, which well help them avoid/satisfy margin calls.

Some other points:

* The short interest estimates are down. There's certainly been media manipulation, but - weeks ago people pointed to the Ortex and S3 short interest estimates as evidence the squeeze will occur. Now, they call those same estimates fake? I can't say one way or another, but it screams of desperation. I've already seem people saying the official data to be release on Tuesday (Feb 9) will be fake numbers. Be careful of your optimism.
* Do you really think there's enough retail buying power? There's an uphill battle to rebuild upward price momentum. We did see a spike on Friday (Feb 5) when buying restrictions were lifted. But, that tapered off and there's nothing stopping them from putting buy restrictions in place again. You'd hope people had moved off of those brokerages, but be real: not everybody has. Why was there a spike on Friday if people were already on brokerages without buy restrictions?
* Oh, but there will be a gamma squeeze? There was supposed to be a gamma squeeze last Fri (Jan 29), but it didn't happen. Oh, but then people said the effects of that gamma squeeze are delayed? But there was still no gamma squeeze the following week (Feb 1-5). And now there's supposed to be another gamma squeeze? I doubt it. But I'm honestly too stupid to refute it properly.
* Oh, but the squeeze will still happen because there's a ""failure to deliver"" problem? I honestly don't understand this yet, but I'm super cautious at this point. It seems like there is always another ""ace in the sleeve"" reason the squeeze will still happen.

I am willing to be convinced otherwise. I don't understand everything. But it seems to me the chance has passed. The momentum is lost. There's no surprise factor. Short sellers can anticipate and react to suppress a potential squeeze as much as possible.",q1u2acker,30,/r/stocks/comments/le7syu/gme_institutions_hold_177_of_float/gmb6fbb/,0.096,0.784,0.12,0.8453

51,DD," Not necessarily. If we get incredibly logical, the warning you linked, shows three possible options or a combination of them.  


1) multiple sources overlapping  
2) increased shorting activity  
3) change in shares outstanding  


We can probably rule out option 3 contributing the number higher than 100%.  


Now OP is making the gamble that institutional holding is up to date and that number represents shorting activity (option 2).  


However we don't need to make that gamble because there are other DD posts from other sources that shows institutional holding is near or over 100%.

162,BB," Thanks for sharing. I get what you’re saying, but wasn’t the main deal between Ford and BB for the infotainment segment of QNX (SDL)? Again, I’m bullish on BB and I’m confident that QNX will still continue to operate the backend software of vehicles, but Ford dropping the infotainment part of QNX is still a disappointment. From PRs dating back to 2016 (roughly) I know that BB’s point of emphasis on their contract with Ford was the infotainment deal.

The reason we can’t dismiss Ford’s dropping of QNX as “nothing” is because it is reflective of the market share that QNX is losing in the infotainment segment. There are figures out there that prove so. Personally, I believe there is plenty of growth outside of infotainment but as an investor I try to be unbiased to recognize where a company might be losing and where it’s winning (the lost revenue from the Ford deal is not negligible). I’m in BB for the winning reasons.",thecryptojuice,7,/r/stocks/comments/le6xon/bbs_many_clients_and_partners/gmai8zg/,0.083,0.79,0.127,0.8481
163,BB," I don't know what BB considered the 'main deal' with Ford, but I do believe they are going to be continued partners in using QNX and other BB services such as IVY.

I'm not sure if infotainment is the central focus of BB at all. It is definitely a path to pursue, but I feel like they are more focused on providing a platform for infotainment services like Android to run on. Their SoC allows them to easily do this, so I think it is their intention for deals like this to happen, and to not try and dominate the entire software-based EV market share. That is to say, I'm not that confident that BB has targeting infotainment as a part of their main revenue flows at all. QNX is built to support infotainment systems on top of it, but it seems to me that their main focus is security and robustness when it comes to the future of autonomous vehicles and IoTs

edit: Additionally, it is worth noting that Google does not have a micro-kernel RTOS software OS, which is important because it would not exactly be easy for them to just whip one up in time to begin competing in the EV market as the sector starts to pick up over the next 4-5 years.

165,BB," I'd like to point out that you are on the money here. According to IHS Markit, the relative importance of infotainment for BB has been waning for a while. Blackberry has also been positioning for losing infotainment market share for years. Infotainment is really the only area up for grabs, otherwise BB leads the pack. As this article noted:


“The infotainment space has always been ripe for disruption,” Rhodes explains. “The barrier to entry certainly needs scale, but there are a lot of tech companies with a lot of scale out there.

“The safety-critical space, you can’t buy 50 years of automotive experience, except (through) acquisition. It’s a more secure position to have that niche in – no pun intended.”

Look at the APR for borrowing GME shares. 2 weeks ago, the borrow APR was 80%, so anyone shorting was bleeding money while holding onto shorts. That APR has now dropped to 3.7%, likely because shorts covered and made shares more accessible to lenders.

It is possible that naked shorting occurred too. But that does not imply short interest increased over the last 2 weeks. For one, the latest FTD data we have is from 1/14.",PopularRip,1,/r/stocks/comments/le87x5/gme_guide_and_common_misconceptions/gmg7otx/,0.0,0.888,0.112,0.9455

213,PLTR," >However, I still can't grasp as to why this stock is not favoured by most?

It has a high valuation and therefore needs to deliver a lot to live up to its price. This is a similar argument to Tesla's valuation, but in PLTR's case, it is harder to justify because their total addressable market isn't as large, and neither can it easily be expanded. 

PLTR has a market cap around $60bn atm, with a self-proclaimed Total Addressable market (at stock offering) of $119bn (which includes both commercial and government markets!). 

At the high level, they need to attain a high market share on their TAM, which is going to be a crowded space e.g. Snowflake. Even if they dominate, 50% of market share would be quite something. 

They've got a lot to prove - they're marketing themselves as SaaS, but they do have headwinds in that there is a not insignificant amount of integration engineering required for their prodict which they call deploying 'deltas'.

So in a nutshell, by their own lofty expectations (initial offerings always use inflated TAMs), they have an upside of +100% if everything goes absolutely perfectly...and the potential downside just seems a lot more likely.

Personally, I don't see the hype dying down for a little while yet, and with the lockup period expiring soon, there'll be some trading action going on in at least the next 3-6 months. I feel that in the 2-5 year timeframe (especially post-covid), they will struggle to justify their valuation, and interest will slowly wane.

226,PLTR," Agree - if it were so easy to relate market cap to TAM, then there'd be a lot less to discuss, but it's a useful yardstick to understand how much space there might be to grow into. Let's do a slightly deeper dive then. 

If we take future PLTR making revenues of $60bn (half of the TAM is fairly optimistic, but we'll go with it), with net income at ~15% (estimate for mature SaaS companies), then we'd be looking at earnings of $9bn. With a P/E of typically 20x for a reasonably solid company, we arrive at $180bn market cap. 

Taking consistent revenue growth at 50% per year, this would take 10 years, starting at $1bn revenue. With a discount rate of 5% (conservative market return), then we have a company that could be worth $110bn today, or up to 110/60*35= $62 per share today. 

Although this is still 80% higher than today's share price, this does basically assume PLTR performs perfectly for the next 10 years, because the current valuation is really not far off of what it needs to be in 10 years time. 

Again, PLTR needs to:

- show it's actually a SaaS company (or can move that way), not a consultancy reliant on deltas, otherwise it won't reach the required level of profitability to justify its P/E ratio

- grow a huge market share in both commercial and govt markets (not easiest since companies prefer not to play politics)

- continue to generate 50%+ revenue growth past covid (historically it's closer to 20-30%)

- stay a leader in the field (perhaps this isn't as difficult, given their reputation so far and the people they hire, but tech is a quick moving field and 10 years is a long time)

264,ALL," ETFs are indeed affected by price and demand, so in theory - yes, if the demand is ETF X is insanely high it will affect it's price. But in practice it won't because there are these so called Authorized Participants or Market Makers that step in and use this as an arbitrage opportunity to balance the inefficiency and get the ETF price right back where it belongs (the value of the underlying assets). 

This is completely legal and actually super useful for both sides (1 side being Market Market who get free money by using the arbitrage and the 2nd side being the index fund issuer who buys/sells shares tax free as the AP is covering that cost as part of the deal). It is a very secure mechanism that ensures no conflict of interest. You can read more here  [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/redemption-mechanism.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/redemption-mechanism.asp)

Of course, even then if the whole world is buying the same ETF this will create extra demand for the underlying shares so the price of the underlying will go up as the market makers are buying more and more and creating baskets for the ETF, which will rise the ETF's price but the price of the ETF will still at least be equal of the underlying securities.  


You don't need to worry about your ETF not reflecting the accurate prices. Regulation has that covered. And in case you are worried about the more general question of whether ALL indices are creating an index bubble (which is an entirely different thing) here's a video by Ben Felix which explains why they aren't.

352,HP," I don't want to be rude but I think your research is quite shallow and not very useful. You highlight Q3 results but you don't mention that this was exceptional quarter. As people stayed at home a lot of demand got brought forward and most stay-at-home companies had amazing results. Lenovo, HP, Dell all had the best sales in 10 years. This is not because they are suddenly brilliant companies but because of lock downs and work from home. Will Corsair be able to sustain this record growth as lock down eases? Remember, this is growth company so even if it grows but not as fast as analysts are predicting share price will be tumbling down. Also, you seem to be dishonest or ignorant about Corsair competitors. Logitech is not the only competitor. There are plethora PC hardware manufacturers that are not publicly listed. We have Cooler Master, endless number of well regarded PC cases manufacturers, in keyboards we have SteelSeries, and really there are just too many to list. And they very well regarded manufacturers, liked by gaming community. And then of course we have endless array of cheap Chinese knock off brands. If real economy is in recession how many gamers will spend big money on premium accessories? How many will opt out for cheaper but only slightly less premium brand? Finally, as with any hardware manufacturer, margins are razor thin (Corsair 2018 and 2019 profit margins were negative) and business is really cut throat. Also, keyboards and mice don't have much of a moat. I will admit that Corsair has some moat in marketing, brand recognition and fan base but that kind of moat can melt away really fast. Corsair could cut products quality to improve margins and fan base would turn on them in a split second.

&#x200B;

To be clear I don't think Corsair is terrible company or that they will go out of business. I think they have many tailwinds and if management play it smart it could be good investment.

370,EV," Yeah I can read actually. 

Tesla made a profit this year (after losing money for almost their entire existence) 

The issue with that profit was that it only came from selling and trading emissions caps for car companies, something which will disappear in 3-5 years when other companies EV programs catch up. 

In the terms of actually selling cars (IE what’s supposed to be their main business), Tesla is still unprofitable and even if they somehow do become profitable the amount of income will be marginal and probably immediately reinvested. 

This isn’t the worst position in the world for a company to be in, but a company that’s at best breaking even on its main business is nowhere close to Tesla’s stock value in terms of its actual intrinsic value.",Wazlit,-1,/r/stocks/comments/le996h/why_i_think_tsla_will_hit_1000_soon/gmhdujf/,0.041,0.821,0.138,0.928

374,LU," Interactive Brokers, Saxo Bank, Swissquote LU. Are the three biggest I know. Probably more available. Saxo and Swiss the money you keep with them is guarenteed by government like a bank, not sure about IB, so that a good thing. So at least any cash you keep on side for investing later is protected. 

As for monthly fees, if you buy monthly into an etf rather than lump sum, then their won't be maintenance fee (please check if that valid for all). 

Degiro account I believe is German Bank account, so cash protected incase of failure, but had bad bad experience with them. But, that just me. Majority probably satisfied or they wouldn't be able to attract clients.

For fun risky trades, Revolut and trading212 I use. Both would not recommend as main broker, just for small risk based trading for free.

Edit: Degiro at least has a phone number to call to help if you have issue, Revolut and trading212 don't have that. But it took months (no joke) for Degiro to solve a 5 minute issue",one8e4,7,/r/stocks/comments/lejr93/140k_in_savings_is_my_plan_good/gmemxch/,0.101,0.747,0.151,0.8459

416,IMO," That's a very interesting point, and I can see that being a big thing in the future if they can start offering the same stuff that Chewy offers. Right now I think that may take a while, but we'll see. 

One thing that amazon/walmart/costco will never have on Chewy IMO is Chewy's level of customer service. Chewy has crazy good customer service adn PR adn a large amount of goodwill from patients/clients. Chewy has you make a profile for your pet when you start getting medications and stuff, and they do dumb little things like send you birthday cards on your pets birthday and stuff like that. I used to think that nobody cared about that stuff, cause I don't at all - until my gf and my sister got those cards and were so happy. They used to actually hand write the cards too which was an extra touch which made us long term customers, but this was back in 2018 so idk if thats still the case. I hope it is and they have a bunch of interns writing cards all day cause that was such a stupid insignificant thing that has made me spend over a thousand bucks with them over the past few years.",PoorVetKid,2,/r/stocks/comments/let9wd/chewy_dd_insight_from_a_vet/gmi7pe2/,0.077,0.792,0.131,0.9249
417,CVS," I think it's disingenuous to say they're not making profits. They're making a ton of profit, they've only made **less** profit one year after increasing exponentially year after year. 

I agree, their cutting into vet hospitals margins but this has been a long time coming for vets. It's the same as human hospitals - the same medication they prescribe you in the hospital you can get at CVS for a fraction of the cost. Vet hospitals are playing the victim and crying now because they finally have competition and cant sell things at the margins they used to. When I go to a human hospital and they try to give me meds I say fuck off and ask for a script - theres no reason the same can't be applied to vet hospitals (and I'm a vet saying this - this literally cuts into my profit margins but it's bad for the consumer so I dont really care). 

Vet hospitals sell things at the price they set cause they have to make a profit, and we get charged by our suppliers a crazy amount more. Chewy is no different than CVS in that they can buy an absurd amount of meds and they know they'll sell it before they expire - so they dont care if their profit per pill is way less since they paid less and are still making bank. 

Per my knowledge - we haven't seen CVS and other retail human pharmacies increase their prices just because hospitals stop carrying certain drugs, and I don't think Chewy will increase their prices just cause vet hospitals stop carrying certain drugs.",PoorVetKid,0,/r/stocks/comments/let9wd/chewy_dd_insight_from_a_vet/gmi9705/,0.141,0.757,0.102,-0.9151
418,LOVE," Honestly - maybe. Every day I see them acquire more and more new customers. Covid has not done ANYTHING to slow the vet field down. More than ever people have pets, and more than ever people are treating their pets like children. Gone are the days of farm medicine where you throw some pills at a dog and if it dies, it dies. People want THE BEST now. And they want answers when their dogs are sick. 


An example is diabetes. 20 years ago diabetes in dogs was treated with either human insulin or a bullet. 

Now a days, there A TON of insulin options - all available on chewy. Additionally, theres more and more insights into oral diabetes drugs and diet therapies to make managing diabetes easier. I have old af clients come in and tell me stories of how their dog in their youth had diabetes and how they never had to spend so much money on insulin and blablabla. They bitch and moan about the ""good ol days"" when they used to get shitty insulin that didnt work and that was enough. 

And after all the bitching and moaning, you know what they do? They buy the new really good insulin and the prescription diabetes diets, because they fuckin LOVE their pets more than their own children who never call. 

And that's just old people on a fixed income spending their entire social security check on their pets to get the best of the best. I LITERALLY tell them ""hey - it's not my business, but you're broke af. Are you sure you want the best insulin? The cheap old insulin is 20 bucks at walmart. Yeah it doesn't work as good, but it was good enough 20 years ago and there's absolutely no shame in using it now. I need to make sure you're taken care of too"" - and they turn and tell me to STFU and write them a script for the good insulin. 

So honestly, with the amount of new pets coming out, the amount of people ordering meds from them increasing every day, and the change in mindset from pets being animals to children - I really can see it increasing 5x because I see owners literally starve themselves in order to treat their pets with the best and newest stuff because they don't want the old stuff (no matter how hard I try to sell them the old, cheap outdated stuff).",PoorVetKid,1,/r/stocks/comments/let9wd/chewy_dd_insight_from_a_vet/gmiebh4/,0.061,0.778,0.161,0.992

475,CAT," I understand your point but is Deere more diverse tho? I don't believe so. They are competitors for a reason, however focused on different branches.

477,CAT," I’d say it’s more diverse yes. Agricultural machinery is an incredibly wide range of products in itself with John Deere producing everything from lawn mowers and ATVs to articulated tractors. there’s only really three corporations with a sizeable market share and John Deere have by far the largest product range. And then on top of that you have the construction equipment. I believe Deere sell something like 330,000 tractors a year. Surely with those kinds of numbers they will find it easier to increase revenue that CAT will with the more specialised machinery they produce. I’m no expert on manufacturing costs etc tho so I may be wrong there. 

The right to repair thing specifically with John Deere honestly gets overblown on Reddit. I’ve been involved in agriculture my entire life and it’s a problem with all manufacturers. The main issue is that tractors are getting more and more advanced with complex electronics and the like and farmers just aren’t capable of fixing them. There are a lot of automated systems on the machines which can be very dangerous if an unqualified person messes around with them. It’s not going to effect their bottom line tho as every manufacturer is the same and Deere have an incredibly loyal customer base. 

To be honest Deere is just the company I know much better of the two and it’s said to be better to invest in the stuff you know about",DismalBobcat,1,/r/stocks/comments/lenfyb/bank_of_america_says_buy_these_17_underowned/gmidgi7/,0.044,0.803,0.153,0.9776

Then speculation becomes self-feeding when people see other people getting excited about the stock, and are now speculating on how much more excitement the company will generate. We're now far removed from actual profit redistribution numbers.

This is where Tesla is right now. There is a first group of investors who believe in Elon Musk and his vision.

No I won’t. Holding it since march bs EDIT “and” getting in now are two separate equations, on tax liabilities alone (you’re this close to gaining another 7% as your gains graduate from regular income to cgt). 

Weighting for the entirety of the risk-reward equation and the introduction of much more downside today than six months ago, the risk-adjusted expected return is in line with plenty other options out there. 

You could be right about continued explosion. If you are, congrats and rock on, and send me a postcard from the moon. 

But investments are forward-looking. Based on the information I have today, I can generate similar expected returns elsewhere without exposing myself to the downside that exists there, so if it keeps mooning, future me will always remember that today, it didn’t make sense based on the information available today, so I’ll be at peace with missing out.",Boomtown626,3,/r/stocks/comments/lentic/expi_more_more_10xd_this_year_i_see_no_one/gmgrbsw/,0.092,0.825,0.083,0.0844

518,EV," The overall EV market is absolutely overvalued, and more than 50% of companies currently in the space will end up being a bust, in my opinion. I think within the next 2-3 years we'll see a lot of the smaller EV startups get acquired or fade away, and the valuations on most of them will come back down to earth where they belong. 

I honestly think once people realized how amazing tesla was, and how incredible their previous growth was, and how their future growth will be, they just figured that any new EV startup could easily accomplish the same, and they just can't. So you have people throwing their money at anyone who expresses the idea of wanting to create an EV.

I should disclose, I'm a huge tesla bull myself. Bought my original 2 shares when I started investing before the march crash for 670$ (after the split it turned into 10 shares at 850$+ ;), then bought a few more around 400$ after the split, and honestly been watching more content on tesla and getting hyped up to possibly buy even more soon.",SorrowsSkills,3,/r/stocks/comments/lekltg/ev_stock_prices_question_about_the_future/gmgr6au/,0.014,0.828,0.158,0.9766

AAPL - Awesome business model, great managament and very good finances. They are very diversified with the products and services that they sell and the EV stuff has incredible potential.

MSFT - From Windows to a diversified tech juggernaut. one of the key reasons I like them so much is the fact that they’re competing in so many areas. Gaming, personal computing, consumer tech, Office 365 and of course the nest egg Azure. Brilliant finances and I’m very confident when I give money to Nadella’s hands. 

DIS - Another good long term play. Still recovering from COVID, but it won’t be a big problem in the long term. When the parks and cruises open, Disney is looking like a real snack. Disney+ will make a ton of money for them and make them an even more diversified in the entertainment business. Will always remain a big part of American pop culture.

V - The absolute leader in the payment market. Clear leader and they pretty much have a duopoly with MA. Profits will get even better as we move to a more cashless world. They’re also staying innovative and they really want to push to the crypto and fintech markets even more. They are also a recovery play as a lot of their revenue got knocked out because of the pandemic.

JNJ - I feel very safe when I hold JNJ. The biggest pharma giant in the world builds them a very nice moat. Great margins as expected from the pharma business and a experienced management. The other company alongside Micorsoft with a credit rating of AAA which tells that they have good finances. Dividend is very steady and healthcare is very recession proof.

556,SQ," So question for you. I and most of my friends are considered growth traders. We’re millennials (I’m 25) and we would pick SQ and PayPal over things like Visa and MasterCard. Because it’s something we see as disruptive and has a lot more room for growth. Why would you choose a company like Visa over them? Is it because it’s safer, trusted, and more stable and more or less guaranteed returns against a company like Square which had an insane run up and could still have possible pitfalls down the road.

576,SENS," My wife is a Type One diabetic and wears a CGM, just so you know the perspective that I'm coming from.

To a diabetics health, it seems a CGM is one of the most useful devices. From what I can see in the US, there are 2 big players in the CGM market currently. Dexcom and Medtronic. Abbot's Freestyle Libre exists and is the most affordable (I think, but don't hold me to that), but requires the user to tap their receiver to the transmitter to receive their readings.

Medtronic offers a full ecosystem for diabetics where the CGM can send readings to their insulin pump and adjust the amount of insulin that is being given to the user.

Dexcom does not have an insulin pump. However, they can communicate with Tandem's T:Slim X2 pump.

I believe for SENS to become a player in the market they will have to integrate with an insulin pump. I love the idea of the SENS sensor over Dexcom and Medtronic, but the integration with a pump is very valuable.

The 6 month wear time is great. I would worry about reliability issues with the sensor. Dexcom sensors are far from perfect. They have an array of issues including the sensors sometimes not deploying from their inserter. Sometimes they just randomly fail. If SENS has a random failure, what would the user do?

All of that said, if SENS announced a partnership with Tandem, my wife would go immediately to her doctor to try it out.

I'll also say that I have a poor track record of exiting these stocks at the right time. I was heavily invested in TNDM when it was in the single digits. I sold after about 100% gains. If I held, I'd have my house paid off with money to spare.",sewright22,4,/r/stocks/comments/lekthd/anyone_have_thoughts_on_sens/gmfiam8/,0.054,0.858,0.088,0.8869

636,FNKO," Don't play games. You're smarter than that.

Here's how it works.

You have 10 shares of FNKO at $10 each.

The stock increases to $20 per share.

That means your 10 shares are worth $200 total.

You sell 5 shares at $20 each for $100 total (this is your example).

When you sell those shares you owe money on the profit.

The profit is $50 which is calculated by taking the price you paid ($10) and subtracting it from the money you received for selling it ($20) and multiplying it by the number of shares you sold (5). 

Here is the math: 

$20 - $10 = $10 per share profit

$10 times 5 shares = $50 in total profit",LavenderAutist,66,/r/stocks/comments/lei09s/if_i_put_100_in_a_stock_let_it_go_up_and_pull_out/gmd31bv/,0.015,0.724,0.261,0.9806

641,SPCE," There's nothing wrong with taking profit.

SPCE is up a lot these past few weeks, and now is an excellent opportunity to sell with no risk. The other option is to hold through the test flight. It's probably safe to say that the stock will pop on a successful flight and it will drop on a failed test. This option offers a higher payout, but it comes with greater risk.

But the current stock price is higher than it has historically been just prior to other test flights. I think this is a side effect of to the GameStop short squeeze. This inflated price diminishes the reward you can earn from a successful test, while also increasing the risk.

They are avoiding expensive growing methods by using a creative approach announcing the other day that they will be introducing synthetic cannabinoids for the Canadian market for a jaw dropping 10 cents a gram:

Aside from Cronos, I think the ancillary cannabis companies are the way to play weed stocks because they don't contain cannabis and hence allow listing on the most liquid exchanges such as Nasdaq and institutional money can pour into these cannabis related names now/today as opposed to being shut out of other companies that contain cannabis because institutional money usually has mandates to not allow investing in something that is Federally illegal:

Hydrofarm (HYFM) - IPOed in Dec and a leading hydroponics manufacturer and distributor

GrowGeneration (GRWG) - leading hydroponics retailer

Agrify (AGFY) - recent IPO and a hydroponics growing solutions services provider

760,TTWO," • ATVI mentioned more engagement in Q4 compared to Q3 even though ATVI noticed some of its markets had lifted some restrictions in Q4 while Q3 was peak lockdown

• ATVI guided above expectations for FY '21, including slight growth for bookings despite some bears calling for a decline as the economy reopens. ATVI didn't even need Overwatch 2 or Diablo 4 for FY '21 guidance either to guide above expectations and will be likely released in FY '22 - FY '23, which just means they have the most compelling multi-year pipeline in the intermediate term among the top publishers

• It's not all about revenue growth! Operating margins were up 700 basis points this year due to the shift towards more recurring, digital, and higher margin revenue from game downloads and digital economies such as WarZone, CoD Mobile, and WoW Classic. Margins are guided to go up another 300 basis points. These video game publishers are gradually turning their business models similar to SaaS companies and will warrant a higher multiple over time. Right now, ATVI trades at just 18.2x FY '21 EBITDA, which is a big discount from other cloud plays that have recurring, digital, high-margin revenue.

768,EV," Tencent dominates the Asian market, with hands in the western world. They're also a lot more than just gaming, almost all of it successful. I'm very bullish in China as a whole, and Tencent is at or near the the top of those companies for me.

Mobile gaming is both the largest gaming platform, and I believe the best opportunity in gaming over the next ten years. Unity almost has a monopoly on that market. They need to get profitable, but I like the opportunity a lot.

I keep a really small portfolio to begin with, and I'm not trying to put all my eggs in one sector, so I honestly can't give you a real answer on the rest. Activision seems to be a successful company (doesn't Tencent own a minority stake in them?), obviously Microsoft is a great play beyond gaming, hard to go wrong there. I've heard good things about Sea, but I'm not knowledgeable enough to feel comfortable voicing an opinion.

I think the gaming market as a whole is up there with cannabis and EV in terms of growth potential, but the above two are where I would put my money. Currently in U at 10ish% of my portfolio, not in Tencent (have been in the past), but strongly considering getting back in.

780,CPA," You’re short term capital gains are treated as self employed income, subject to the same tax bracketing rules. So essentially your income is already at 370,000 for the year. Since you can’t withold income from yourself like an employer would you have to make payments to the IRS quarterly. “reinvesting” doesnt wash it out. Its a seperate transaction with a new basis for whatever you get. If you did take your profit and  reinvest it any resells on a gain / or loss are also taxed  / deducted at year end filing.

Keep a spreadsheet of your P/L (irs has a form t8949 its the itemized form of what you report on a 1040) you will file for 2021 taxes concerning short and long term net capital gains or losses.

normally the quarterly payments are due 15 days after the quarter ends (apr 15 2021 for jan-mar 2021) but there are some wierd covid extensions in place so definitely call your CPA. 

your original question is the stocks sold in feb 2022 would go on 2022 long term capital gains or losses 

note: not a cpa or financial advisor, just spent way to much time on the irs website this past week and consulta with my CPA from filing 2020 taxes. if any of this is blatantly wrong ill edit.
