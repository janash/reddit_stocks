74,VERY," That basically tells you everything you need to know.

For everyone quoting the aphorism: *time in the market etc* is failing to realize that that doesn't ALWAYS mean you have to have all your money allocated in one direction.  Buffett doesn't time the market, per se, but he DOES wait for wonderful companies to become attractively priced.  If a wonderful company were attractively priced right now I'd bet he'd buy it.

Additionally look at what he's bought... He DIVESTED out on long term banks he's had (except two... That should be HUGE). He's gone to a very limited portfolio of VERY safe investments (transport/telecoms/CANDY/ Medicine).  

Those are all shit hits the fan stuff to own.   

The writing is on the wall.  It's best to read it!

Best of luck!

* Russell 2k on 25th will trend pps upwards
* Recently canceled proposal to increase share dilution

**Thoughts**

Any good news will give investors something to smile about either short term or long term.

The monopoly the company will hold over this drug will spark a crazy bidding war when its time for a buyout. AND the talks of seeking a partnership will ensure companies seeking to buy them out come correctly with a sizable offer. I saw **ITOS**  partnership announcement earlier in the cancer space. That's just for phase 1 trials. Giving me even more confidence in a partnership since **ATOS** will be entering phase 3 trials. The best event this month is the upcoming russell 2k.

One is where you could've invested in Microsoft at the peak of the Dotcom bubble in 2000 and still returned 9% a year and beat the index.

Walmart was way overvalued in the 70's but returned something like 13% a year since then.

301,AMD," This is actually a valid question and the semiconductor industry is one of the more interesting ones to me.

First off I'll use a couple popular examples here from the past year.

Micron went from a 52 week low of $42 to a 52 week high of $95. 

Nvidia $349 to $717

AMD $48 to $99

They went up huge already!

So here is a good lesson about the market, it's forward looking. It's about investing in what is going to happen, not what has happened and this is especially true in Semiconductors. Those unfamiliar with the space are likely to jump in at all the wrong times.

The shortage is nothing new and investors have been piling into this trade for months! 

So what's happening now?

Well now you have more and more semiconductor factories being able to operate at higher and higher capacity as the pandemic winds down across the globe. 

You have the U.S. passing funding of $53 billion dollars to onshore production of Semiconductors. 

You have one of the largest markets, crypto, decreasing in value, and the second largest crypto asset, Ethereum, on the verge of moving away from mining all together. 

Also companies haven't been able to capitalize on the market in the way you'd want. Although a shortage can raise prices higher, it's different then a demand spike.

They weren't able to produce as much, which means they weren't able to move a higher amount of volume at a higher price. 

Thus being able to produce more then fixes the supply issue, lowers the price, and then they are able to move more product, but at a lower price. 

So the ideal time to get into the Semiconductor trade was right when the shortage started to happen. When it looked like nobody was going to be buying a car or a PC and all the production was slowing down, basically when it looked like a terrible time to buy.

Now you have a decreasing of demand, or atleast a leveling out, matched with an increasing ability for companies to meet that demand.

Thus although they will finally be moving more volume, it'll be at a lower price. 

Semiconductors is an industry that traps a lot of people. The worst time to invest usually ends up being the best, and the what looks like the best ends up being the worst. 

So if you're wondering why they aren't going up now?

*TLDR:*

Investors already bid up the price of the companies in anticipation for a shortage and are now leaving the trade in anticipation of an increase of supply in the market.",piggydancer,43,/r/stocks/comments/nzg7pz/how_is_this_even_possible_not_to_be_going_up_daily/h1peql0/,0.081,0.809,0.11,0.9272

308,ATH," I tend to distrust the Fed simply because of history :D I'm not sure when they've been honest and transparent about their actual goals (provided that they realised their goals. If that wasn't the case, then they are simply incompetent and, again, we shouldn't be listening to them IMO). Plus, even Ray Dalio says it, if the government comes out and says ""Don't worry, we'll support a strong dollar"", the next thing you can expect is a devaluation of the dollar. The Fed is trying extremely hard to control this narrative of transitory inflation and I don't believe them. Obviously, I could be wrong, but it's really hard to think of transitory inflation when there are so many inflation indicators spiking.

Also, I know that everyone is talking about extreme measure last year, but at least price-wise (and therefore inflation-wise), there were no massive changes! Apart from oil, I guess, but that's a tiny bit of the inflation index. Food prices spiked last year, but now they continue to rise. Housing prices are hitting ATH, etc. Obviously it could be a temporary bottleneck, but the Fed seems to downplay everything even when the stats are way worse that they make them out to be. I guess they want to avoid panic in the markets, but when the hell did it become their priority to look after the markets? it's just a weird situation and from what I'm seeing in the stats and so on, everything is leaning towards prolonged high inflation, e.g. 5% or more.

I guess we'll see next month and the month after. There's really nothing we can do apart from speculation until we see the actual number :)

You're right though, it's hard to see what this changes. I'm also long stocks, but I've switched more and more towards value and commodity producers to benefit from inflation. I think some of these hyped up growth stocks will plunge in the next few months.

313,AMZN," I would say that the 10%+ drop in the Nasdaq this time earlier this year was much more about other stocks besides the bellwethers of that July-August run from last year (which were Apple and Amazon).

Now don't get me wrong, profitable tech got it fairly good but in being specific and going from when the drop really began for the Nasdaq, just as one example:

TSLA: -31% (worse if you go from when it had the blow off top)

AMZN: -10%

That doesn't even get into small cap tech, which don't get me started there...(although I haven't touched any of them). When you think of a ""Growth Investor"" here, many are in those kinds of names and not an AMZN.

But the ""right now"" here is the index itself seems ready to exit a 4 month consolidation period unless a catalyst stops it. I honestly don't think it really ""fully"" happens until next month though.",95Daphne,1,/r/stocks/comments/nzvf04/wednesday_fed_meeting/h1rymjr/,0.038,0.862,0.101,0.8814

Whether it takes 10 years or 10 weeks, once it hits that target, you can sell. 

This just happened to me with ANAT. It shot up 25% in like a single day a month ago, to what was my price target.

360,RIDE," Stephen S. Burns is a con artist. You want to talk about getting rich off of ""dumb money"", the (now) former CEO of Lordstown motors is your guy.

You realize he's out as CEO because his fraudulent activity got out of hand and the CFO goes with by default because he manages the books that let his tomfoolery happen. 

The good news is, when Mr.Burns left Workhorse is when their stock price started going up (and overall business started improving).

361,RIDE," Fair points, but they stated that even without the additional capital, they will start with halved production (1100 trucks instead of 2200) and full production if they get the extra money. The funny thing to me is that the news outlets were creating a big deal of them being late with filing the 10-Q, but when they did and announced all the things that were already said in the conference call and earnings report, everyone lost their shit and said LMC is going bankrupt, when they absolutely had to word it that way because of SEC (going concern in the next 12 months without extra capital). They will still be fine until Q2 2022 without the extra money.

I do agree the 20-30$ valuation was a bit crazy at the start of the year, but I don't see how at this point in time, RIDE can be below 12-13$, and I'm trying to be objective and conservative even though I'm bullish on the stock long term.

All of the stuff bears and hates were pointing out in recent months were proven wrong, the only 2 remaining things were the money issues and CEO being hated and considered a scammer/fraud, now he's gone and if they get extra financing, what then?
