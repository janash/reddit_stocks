0,DD, I think I saw someone request that I elaborate on how I pick my company for the catalyst and their post was most likely removed for low Karma so here it is: you can find earnings/report/whispers/confirmation/conferences calendars online all over and sometimes the right one doesn’t pop up until Thursdays or even early Fridays. You can use a scanner but I’m old school I guess. Then I check out those companies with the right prices for good gains and vet them hardcore DD and make my list. I break them down based on what I said earlier in the initial post.

1,ZSAN," When did you start exactly? A lot of stocks have also doubled in the past few months. How does your strategy compare to this? Doubled your money in... a month? 3 months? Since March 18th?

Details matter if you’re going to post something like this, especially if you’re writing this for “new traders.” I fear that if you’ve only managed to double your money day trading penny stocks using this strategy that you’re either also new, or your strategy doesn’t bode well at beating the market.

That said, how’s your ZSAN position? Did you use this strategy and get stuck in a trade or have you profited well from it?",adioking,4,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/ljzs8e/how_i_make_my_money_for_newer_traders/gni0n4t/,0.071,0.834,0.095,-0.264

5,EV," Think about it this way. Why would you day trade, which is basically a negative zero sum game after the large time investment and commissions/order flow fuckery, when you can just long term invest/speculate and participate in the consistent growth of the economy. One’s negative EV unless you somehow have the crystal ball whereas the other is +EV even if you are an absolute idiot. Academic studies show day traders lose around 99% of the time, which leads me to believe the 1% that do succeed is due to luck. Also, even long only day trading basically removed the greatest advantage longs have in the stock market. Most of the market actually performs quite terribly and “stocks go up” is actually untrue. The historical growth the S&P and DJI and Russell have seen are because a few companies will become dominant and have tremendous growth, which is uncapped, that makes up for the shitty performance of the bottom tier of the market. By day trading you don’t let those winners run for a long time and make up for the general randomness of stocks.",gopackthomas,2,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/ljzs8e/how_i_make_my_money_for_newer_traders/gnjbbt8/,0.099,0.791,0.11,0.1045

That's why I have my plan and goals and when I reach my plan goals, whether for a particular investment or the entire portfolio, I take it. No if ands or buts. 10% return is 10% return.

I have a Roth at vanguard and the average the last 3 years has been 13%.

I just started a RH account for fun. Up 74% in not even a month. I know how unrealistic this is.  Am I happy yes. Should we all take advantage. Yes!!

I think people need to understand that normally if your investment goes up between 7-14%  annually that's Gooood! Beating inflation with some extra.  Be careful with your money, and be safe.

35,SO," So many new traders are entering the market lately. Learning how to trade in a bull market, especially one this insane, can be pretty dangerous. Things won’t always be this easy. There are SO many posts of people buying a stock and saying things to the effect of “why is this turd barely moving” or “why does this just keep dropping” after buying it after a 100% run in two weeks. None of this is normal, and while I don’t recommend sitting on the sidelines, I would recommend strongly exercising caution and remembering we are not owed anything. Even if your stocks are running 100% on momentum, it doesn’t mean you shouldn’t still learn fundamental valuation so that when this gravy train does finally end (whenever that may be), you know what should stay and what should go.",jaxpax22,2,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/lkgr8c/to_the_people_who_think_15_weekly_gains_are_slow/gnju2vh/,0.045,0.862,0.094,0.7286

All in all, I wanted to be a long-term merger shareholder. So I’m at around $20,000 (would have been $35,000 if I’d bought up front and just held). I’ve learned from that. Before this stock I invested about $4000 and made $5000 in a month. Again, I was just learning. I had no idea what I was doing back then. That was October. I know even more of nothing now, but I’m slowly gaining some ability to read charts etc. and I do research. I generally only invest in one stock at a time. Two at most.

37,VERY," The concept of slow and steady by picking up 5-15% gainers a week is more of a penny stock motto. Penny stocks are notoriously volatile, seeing 10% swings in both directions in a day is incredibly common. The problem with this is that a lot of new penny traders like to think every stock that has a run like this is a guaranteed unicorn and end up bag holding for a long time after the stock jumps 10% on Monday then falls 25% Tuesday. 

To your point of “it is rare to exceed 10% annually”, that is true for people who invest into safe bets and let it sit. IE, ETFs and index’s. For those who take even a semi-active roll (check your portfolio once every two weeks) and take a more educated approach to their portfolio, 15% is usually a low number for annual gains. With how bullish the market has been for the past year or so, 25% is VERY feasible with minimal effort.",StankyPeteTheThird,1,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/lkgr8c/to_the_people_who_think_15_weekly_gains_are_slow/gnk9555/,0.03,0.884,0.086,0.8093

43,AGTC," To be completely fair, many of us who are new to this don't have that much skin in the game, so chasing highly volatile stock for weekly 15% or even 20% gains is not all that crazy when we're only playing with a few hundred dollars to begin with.

48,AMC," I'm right there with you. I started with $200 trying to play the AMC squeeze. I got in too late but didn't listen to the stupid diamond hands shit so I only lost $1.28 out of that. I jumped on dogecoin with a tiny amount of money and lost $3.51 on that. Then I started to learn, research, and rode Amazon for a bit to recoup that lost money. Last week Monday was when I really got into it, and despite taking a few losses that taught me some valuable lessons, I ended Friday after-market close at $492, or up a ridiculous 130% from Monday market open.

I know that's not normal, but if I can ride this crazy stupid bull market to a better life for my family with just an initial investment of $200, I'm going to try to do it.

58,AG," I've been trading exclusively based on charts and technicals for the past month now as an experiment, and I've been very happy with the results. For any people looking to get into this kind of trading, here are some things to keep in mind. There are certainly caveats, success is very much in the set up. 

1. **Candle intervals can make or break a trade based on charts**. Match your intervals to your timeframe. If you're looking at 1 minute interval candles while planning weekly or monthly trades, you're going to see a LOT of noise. If you don't/can't day trade on your account you probably shouldn't be focusing solely on minute by minute trends. Fit your candle to the size of the room you're lighting up. Don't use birthday candles to light a cathedral, don't put those giant Maria candles on your birthday cake.

2. **Make sure you don't rely on a single indicator** (or type of indicator). Sometimes what you're seeing could just be a fakeout, an artifact of a extreme price action in the past, low volume, etc... Usually combining something like RSI and MACD are great in confirming momentum, but you can fool yourself if you're not using another type of indicator. For example, I like to combine these two with bollinger bands and OBV to see a clearer picture.  

3. **Finding an entrance is easy, planning your exit is harder**. This applies to trading in general, but make sure you understand how to pick out patterns/signs that tell you it's time to get out before you starting buying shares/options like a madman. And as with any trade strategy, don't be a greedy fomo SoB.

4. **Many indicators contain a certain amount of ""lag""** behind the price action you need to take into account. Again, Multi-Indikator plans will help here, but it's something to keep in mind.

5. **Indicators can't forecast real life**. The trends could all be there that Five Buys Tendies and Upsides AG is going to break out, but uh oh the day after you bought in, it was announced the CEO has been embezzling and it's been leaked the company's trendies are made out of roadkill and endangered animals. 

Tl;dr: trading on technicals is very powerful, but there's a learning curve you need to understand before you start dumping money into trades based on them. 

**Disclaimer**: I am absolutely not an expert and this isn't financial advice. I'm just a guy who likes trading penny stocks and programming so I play with indicators a lot to do both. Please feel free to point out any inaccuracies in what I said. I can also move this to its own post if anyone wants that",UBahn1,8,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/lkaoy2/anyone_interested_in_looking_at_charts/gnjdj8a/,0.029,0.855,0.116,0.9904

61,AGTC," On the same boat here and I am sure as much as fundamentals matter,Technical analysis is the way to go and there is a reason why most if not all successful traders are technical.
I will give you an example,I went in AGTC after the hype and bought in the morning pullback,Because I had no idea where the actual resistance was I didn’t sell even after being 200 up in few minutes.
The stock makes a pullback and then hits my stop loss essentially turning my unrealised gains into loss.
If I was trading technically,I am more than sure I would have sold once the resistance was gonna hit because the buying volume wasn’t enough to break it.
Also technical analysis would have prevented many people from burning in recent weed stocks.

I think if you are looking at longer term investments, or even swing trades, DD should be more focused on the typical business fundamentals/news avenues.  Where the TA could help in these cases is to look and see if the timing is good - is the stock trading near the top or bottom of a channel?

177,CC, Can you explain where the value lies in snagging 100 and then selling CC’s. Can’t seem to dial in the CC logic in my brain.,IrishSuperMario,1,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/lk3jbq/what_are_you_buying_tuesday_morning/gnjwj8d/,0.099,0.816,0.085,-0.1027
178,IBIO," For example, I have IBIO at $2 average and own 100 shares. 

I sell a covered call for $3 for a $12 premium. I get that money right away, no prob. 

Then you take the initial investment of 200 (100shares @ $2) and subtract the $12.

Now you have 100 shares, but have paid $188. Your new average share price is 1.88. 

Personally I only do this w companies I believe in and only sell CCs and buy a call at a lower strike price, same expiry  day. Also called a bull call spread or bull credit spread. 

That way, if it hits the 3$ strike price and my shares get called away, I have also taken out a call at the 2.5 strike price on same expiry day. that way, my shares are never actually in jeopardy of being called away.",mckenna_would_say,2,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/lk3jbq/what_are_you_buying_tuesday_morning/gnjya2b/,0.067,0.806,0.127,0.8651

209,CEO," Call me a degenerate. My ideas are my own and I am not a financial advisor. Just want to share my research.

Company: Celsion Corporation (clsn)

This is a pharma company who is currently in the process of inventing a new treatment for advance ovarian cancel. The treatment is currently going through a phase 2 trial and according to the message provided by the CEO, we should receive data back in regards to this trial as in becomes available.

It is also in the process of making a COVID 19 vaccine and other general vaccines to fight viruses. The recent development derived from this process has the company created a Vaccine Advisory Board with its first 2 members added. I expect more quality members to be added this upcoming weeks. So there will be volatility.  The 2 people who were added are Dr. Glaunsinger and Dr. Yang. These 2 scientists have extensive track records in their fields. Dr. Glaunsinger specializes in virology and currently a professor at UC Berkeley, a top medical school. And Dr. Yang specializes very much the same but has practical experience in bringing vaccines to the market due to his leadership in his previous work at Pfizer. 

The company has millions in cash to further studies so that means they don’t need to
Dilute share holders. That’s a plus sign.

Finally, the company has a patent pending to be approved. Even if the company doesn’t produce the product, it could sell the patent rights to generate cash flow. 

So, the price is at 2.45 and I believe it could rise higher. Institutional buyers are buying this already and options strike price at 2.5 has large volume.  Can we see more than 10$ with this low flow? Maybe but we should keep our eyes on it. Target 10$ PT.

SDPI :  super bullish.  no significant downtrends.  some odd market activity that suggests it could surge even higher.   healthy balance sheet.

SNMP.  very strong bullish looks.  just came back down from an abnormally high rally, so it might be a good point to enter.  basically breaking highs every single week.   selling interest has slowed down greatly and it's looking like it could pivot up for a nice rally. closing anything above 1.40 = instant buy. if we keep muddling around in the low 1.30s, i'll wait for a cleaner entry point/stronger pivot.",Panda-feets,0,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/lk1xgq/daily_discussion_thread/gnigzy0/,0.035,0.769,0.195,0.9817

I decided to buy the stock long term along with some options as I really do think the stock is a decent investment.  I can add a post about why it's a good stock
Here is one of many sources backing up what I am saying.  I think its an excellent long term hold compared to the typical pump and dump strategy

335,ALL," wow good find.  from a purely technical standpoint, looks like a great time to buy in.  looks super bullish, but the high of 2.25 was rejected, previously.  so a rally here might be a bit conservative.  the path to the 2.20s looks pretty easy, though.  the stochastic is showing an  acceleration of buying and we are hitting higher lows pretty frequently.  if we close at ALL above 2.00 and the buying momentum still looks strong, it's a no brainer buy-in from me.",Panda-feets,3,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/lk8c2i/gvp_gse_systems/gniib29/,0.092,0.634,0.273,0.9555
336,ANY," i'm super super super new to this shit too. . like 3 days of charting / technicals lol but first and foremost, ANY whole dollar amount at the pennystock level is going to be a psychological factor.  if something is trading sideways for a while and nears a whole dollar amount, the bulls and the bears will fight it out.  you can sorta guess who has the momentum based off of moving averages and stochastics, but it's literally just a gamble unless the momentum is SUPER strong and you sail right past it.  in this case, the momentum for buying isn't super high, but it is there.  some of the technicals are indicating that the buying interest is higher than the selling interest (MACD reversal, Stochastic above 50%)   but the reality is that i don't trust anything more than seeing a few candlesticks close above 2 in order to absolutely confirm my suspicion of overall bullish activity.  and if it hits 2 and gets immediately rejected downwards, i would not be surprised either.  the market is so heavily based on speculation it's ridiculous.  anyway, here is my chart for this.  The regression band (blue / yellow) area shows the point at which 3 standard deviations worth of activity has occurred.  as you can see, it's overall very bullish.  assuming no bad catalyst, it should continue trending upwards nicely.  the question is if we will crack that 2.30 barrier some time in mid / late march (if my regression holds) I'll likely take profits before that, if i do enter on tuesday.

337,SDPI," thanks! i posted my positions for tuesday on the subreddit about an hour ago, if you wanna take a look a those.  i can also send you the charts, if you want :) eh actually i'll just copy paste.. 

MY probable buys on Tuesday:

SDPI : super bullish. no significant downtrends. some odd market activity that suggests it could surge even higher. healthy balance sheet.

BHAT: Interesting patterns starting to develop. if it can close a single candlestick above 1.70 it's an instant buy from me. my more conservative regression shows the possibility of it trending downwards for a bit, so if we close under 1.56 at all, best to hold off for a little while and wait for a better entry point. still a lot of upside, overall. might just set back your earnings a few weeks ;)

SNMP. very strong bullish looks. just came back down from an abnormally high rally, so it might be a good point to enter. basically breaking highs every single week. selling interest has slowed down greatly and it's looking like it could pivot up for a nice rally. closing anything above 1.40 = instant buy. if we keep muddling around in the low 1.30s, i'll wait for a cleaner entry point/stronger pivot.",Panda-feets,3,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/lk8c2i/gvp_gse_systems/gnincci/,0.029,0.776,0.194,0.9877
