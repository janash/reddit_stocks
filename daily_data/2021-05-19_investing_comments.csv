0,ETH," In their idealized world, Bitcoin would be a store of value. And who knows, maybe it will be one day. But until then its a highly speculative asset which can gain or lose 80%+ in a short time and have 20% swings in an even shorter amount of time.

Cheers to the people that bought it a long time ago, but to everyone who jumped on in the last few months, I sincerely hope you only invested money that you could do without for a while, and didn't crank up your exposure too high.

Before today I was about 7% crypto. Occassionally, there's been a few extremely speculative trades, which is why 10% of that balance is in DOGE, but otherwise I have BTC and ETH. And more importantly, I have no need to pull that money out and just accumulate a little more through regular scheduled purchases. And I only do that after all my other regular investment contributions (work retirement plan, ordinary investment account) occur.

If in 10 years its $100,000 or more, then good job me. If the world loses interest in it and it somehow goes to zero, it won't break me either. But really, that's my philosophy across my entire portfolio.",lowlyinvestor,1,/r/investing/comments/ngamt2/can_we_please_throw_out_the_idea_that_bitcoin_is/gyqnodi/,0.042,0.784,0.174,0.9835

2,IMO," It IS a hedge against inflation. Just because we see -50% in a month doesn’t mean we’re not still up damn near 300% YTD. IMO, the crypto market is down because a bunch of paper handed bitches pumped up dogecoin so the whales could dump, they played themselves. This is causing havoc on the rest of the crypto market because it makes crypto just look illegitimate as a whole. Personally I think the price of bitcoin is too low, but I think we COULD hit 25k, but I’m buying the current dip anyway because the difference between 39k and 25k is less than the difference between 60k and 100k+. If you aren’t prepared to hold at -50%, you’re not prepared to thrive at +300%.",RS_Germaphobic,1,/r/investing/comments/ngamt2/can_we_please_throw_out_the_idea_that_bitcoin_is/gyqxdml/,0.065,0.871,0.064,-0.057
3,GME," Bitcoin was started to decentralize currency, and ended up as a money laundering tool outside SEC regulations. Hedge funds use Crypto to pump up their assets, unfortunately due to their UNCLOSED (they just doubled down repeatedly and kicked the can down the road by hiding the FTDs with all sorts of trickery) short positions on stocks like GME, they are now getting margin calls and being liquidated. We are seeing massive selloffs in all sectors because of margin calls due to NAKED SHORTING (creation of counterfeit shares). These overleveraged hedge funds are tanking the economy, and the only safe place fo ryour money currently is GME because of the massive hidden short interest.

>Fortunately inflation isn't a problem actually, so BTC must be going down for another reason.


IMO everyone trying to explain why BTC goes up or down is playing a fool's game, the fuckin thing swings by 15% if Elon Musk makes a mean tweet.  The drop today reversed after Elon tweeted the diamond hands emoji.

41,ALOT," Hey Mikethethinker. I'm new here but I've been investing for quite a while. The way I find good picks is by really knowing the company. I'm going to use Apple as an example. when the first iPhone came out I decided to invest in their stock because I thought the iPhone was revolutionary. Of course I did my due diligence by researching their iPod, iMac, iTunes products and advertising campaign and how successful they were at creating their products as a lifestyle brand at that time. Along with their quarterly SEC filings. 

Another example would be Netflix. after a few years of being a subscriber to Netflix and not being able to stay away from them for long. I looked into them and how they operate, their SEC filings, their strategy, etc. I decided that it was a great choice for a long term investment. (I've been holding onto it for about 4 years and plan to sell when subscription services no longer are a ""thing"". To follow up on subscription services. if you watched the news about COVID a lot of subscription services did very well last year Zoom would be the best example. I think they will remain strong as long as there is a need for their subscription service in their  marketplace.

A recent example would be Moderna. After hearing in the news and looking into their company I put them on my watch list. I didn't jump in right away but when it became clear to me that they were a strong contender to get FDA EUA approval I decided to jump in. 

For me it's a lot about gut feeling. Along with what I know and use ALOT. then applying it to look at the company. I hope this helps.",StimpyB27,1,/r/investing/comments/nfw182/where_do_you_get_your_news_for_investing/gyp77oz/,0.009,0.817,0.174,0.9949

Cryptos are faring even worse than stocks, with bitcoin down below 40k. Investors are dumping bonds as well Ten-year yield up 1% to around 1.66%.

Couple of things driving this. One is a new crackdown by the Chinese central bank, the PBOC, on cryptos. Then there is inflation. Apparently the strong earnings by retailers have fed this fire. (Macy’s even beat estimates. If people are shopping at Macy’s they must be really desperate to get rid of their money). 

Producer prices in the UK are growing at their fastest rate in nine years and as I write this Target just came in and beat earnings (Lowe’s the other major retailer beat on revenues but missed pretty big on earnings).

49,ATH," $RILY has shot up in a huge way and it's been somewhat on my radar waiting for a good dip to buy. It's off about 10% from it's ATH. It currently trades roughly around 4x EBITDA, while other firms in the sector are trading around 14x. Its p/e is 3.59

Backing into a price objective via EBITDA is usually a clunky tool, but still -- that's a huge differential. What am I not getting? Even if we knocked 30% off the price objective EBITDA implies it's a stupidly straightforward $100 stock trading at 68 for literally no reason I can see. 

Using FCF, we get a slightly different value depending on what hills you want to die on. Me personally I never hold dividends against the companies so the price/yield target should be ~75-80.

I researched 5 years before 2020.  When I purchased at $5.45 and $2.70, then sold in Jan at $15.50, I made a fortune.  But when I originally decided to buy the stock, I figured it would go to around $20.00. I bought back in at $7.48 and set my limit price at $15.50.  Even thow I made a fortune in Jan, I couldn't help noticing how much more I could have made if I had held till it went all the way to $20.00.

68,SPCE," ""Just buy solid companies""

One issue is that I think people got too caught up in very speculative growth themes last year and bought into things like WKHS -- which is now down about 80% since early Feb. That company announced earnings recently and announced that it had delivered 6 trucks. EVs last year and into early this year became a buy at any price mania, even the weakest names and names where delivering *a car* is still a ways off.

Recently SPCE announced that it was not sure when it was going to have its next test flight.  Last year it would have probably been down a bit but bounced because ""Cathy's probably gonna buy more!"" This year it's down 20% in an instant and even Cathy has been selling out of it in her space ETF. (https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/12/cathie-woods-space-exploration-etf-arkx-sells-virgin-galactic-stock.html) Chamath - the person who brought it public via SPAC and the one frequently promoting it - sold all of his stock before the company even had a real flight (and that was when the stock was about twice what it is now.)

It's okay to have some of your portfolio in aggressive growth, but it should be a set of the best aggressive growth ideas and there also really should be a sizable portion devoted to high quality, profitable and well-managed companies with a long track record. You have to have some ""solid companies."" You can have 25 different aggressive growth stocks but that isn't really diversified - if aggressive/disruptive/hyper/whatever growth is out of favor, those are all going to likely be out of favor. 

The Ark-y ""disruptive growth"" had a ""once in a great while"" kind of year last year but when that stopped working in Feb, it stopped working in a hurry.  I said earlier this year that Ark's year last year was not sustainable and there would be a significant correction/rotation, but I think the magnitude of the correction/rotation is even more than I would have expected.

I do feel badly for the major inflow of people earlier this year who seemed to pour in right at the peak of growth stocks and I think young people in many cases do want to invest in what they're excited about and understandably so. But this year has not been the year for growth themes like green energy and it may continue to be a more difficult year for those sorts of things vs last year's super easy year. I think if people are continuing to try to press hyper growth bets, they should look at diversifying at least somewhat elsewhere if they haven't already.

If someone is dismayed/upset by the volatility this year, you have to really create a game plan and gradually adjust to a point where you're more comfortable with your portfolio going forward. Having a smaller % (and what % that is is up to you) in more speculative growth, it forces one to be more selective on what ends up in that basket vs a portfolio full of aggressive growth. Or people are just okay with aggressive growth through periods like last year and this year and are okay with being reliant on that.",dvdmovie1,18,/r/investing/comments/ng0ocy/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/gyojlmm/,0.047,0.748,0.205,0.9984

84,SHOP," > When do we think a shift back to growth might happen? 

I said a week ago that we were probably not far from a bounce in some speculative growth names given how incredibly oversold many of them were but what would be interesting is to see how sustained the bounces are. You've seen some brief bounces in growth but they've been brief and days like yesterday where growth did actually bounce felt weak/fragile.

I still think growth will bounce (looks like it's trying to a little bit again today - SHOP and some others green) but I do think it's going to be a much bumpier year after ""growth stocks only go up"" last year. Additionally, when you look at Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Google and Facebook - they're all up YTD aside from Apple and that YTD decline is relatively minor. 

More broadly, a lot of higher quality, profitable, slower growth names have actually held up pretty well this year. It's the Zevenbergen/Ark-style ""rapidly growing and richly valued but unprofitable"" (or especially the stuff where there isn't even a product/service yet) more aggressive/speculative growth stories that are down significantly.

Huge and highly profitable has held up fine. It's the most speculative stuff that has been obliterated. Last year ""rapidly growing but unprofitable"" had a fantastic year. Now you want the bigger, higher quality, highly profitable names.  The ""we might have a product/service"" in a few years stocks like the battery stuff (QS), space trips where they don't know when they're going to have a *test flight* again (SPCE) and other stuff like that has no support.

I would not be surprised if it's a more difficult year for growth but I do think that when growth becomes back at least a little bit of favor, you might see a bit more selective buying. With some of the most speculative stuff (low quality EV names, etc) it wouldn't surprise me if they never get back to the highs from earlier this year.",dvdmovie1,6,/r/investing/comments/ng0ocy/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/gyp5902/,0.038,0.698,0.264,0.9978

I have some gold exposure but I really think in the modern age where retail investors have access to instruments like coffee futures you don't need gold as the store of value, as you can buy something people actually need that also stores value.

I either trade gold juniors and producers (e.g. NFG, GBR, SA) or GC futures, but I'm mostly in broad mining ETFs for base metals as I feel that is what people actually need (and a bar of steel is as good a store of value as a bar of gold, especially since I don't have to actually have either in my house or a vault somewhere).",Jeff_Bridges_Bridges,1,/r/investing/comments/nfzzbg/investing_in_gold_at_ists_near_all_time_high/gypk5wf/,0.022,0.877,0.101,0.9555

98,AMD," Since I couldn't make this a post here we go.

I'm 23, with a plan to invest my money until I'm 50-55 years old depending on my overall interest rate. Maxed out RIRA for last year and working on this year. 401k 4% match (small paychecks) in mutual funds, about $72 given to me, I give $120. My current amount of liquid/semi-liquid money is $46,000. I need to balance it still and plan on the overall structure being:

60% ETF's
20% Stocks.  27-32 years.  7-9% interest rate
20% Crypto

ETF's being: $27,000
30% VONG --for high growth large cap
15% VIOG --for high growth small cap
10% VTI --for a mix of everything
5% VSS --for slight exposure to other non US markets

Stocks being: $9,200
  Currently held: 
         TESLA- $3,393
         Plug Power- $1207
          Nio- $906
Not allocated: $3694

*I'm thinking about AMD or NVIDIA, Tilray, Sony. No idea what other sectors are decent to invest in as service providers like Edison or PGE have looked terrible since I started investing, and I don't know what other companies might be a good decision.

Crypto being: $9200
At this point in time planning on holding it on an exchange until I feel comfortable buying in.
______________________________________________________

FIRE (If 50 counts)

This is based ONLY on my ETF's so I will hopefully have a lot of wiggle room to get to this point and stay there or grow before accounting for my stocks, crypto, and 401k.

I used investor.gov compound interest calculator. Assuming I put $27,000 in with monthly contributions of $1500 (should be possible) at an interest rate of 7-9% for 27-32 years, at 50-55 years old I will have ~$2,125,000.

From there, withdrawals of ~8500/month pretax at even 5% will result in more money being made than spent, after 40 years the total being $2,638,000. 

Did I do this correctly and is it realistic? I'd like to think that an average 7% return is reasonable and even conservative. Maybe I'm overthinking it but aside from taxes, is the separation of the ETF's between a RIRA and normal exchange going to make an impact on that $2,000,000?  Any thoughts and are there any major flaws in my thinking?",Wit2020,1,/r/investing/comments/ng0np6/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gyoskl0/,0.016,0.924,0.06,0.9003

116,GDP," GDP growth and stock market performance are not positively correlated.

>Several studies (Dimson et al. [2002], Ritter [2005]) have examined whether countries with higher
long-run real GDP growth also had higher long-run real stock market return. The surprising result
was contrary to expectations -- the correlation between stock returns and economic growth
across countries can be negative! Our own analysis confirms this empirical finding: Exhibit 1 plots
stock returns versus GDP growth for eight developed markets between 1958 and 2008 and also
shows negative correlation.

>We have revisited our analyses and still find that the average
cross-country correlation between long-run GDP growth and
long-run stock returns has been effectively zero. Four factors
explain this seemingly counterintuitive result:  
>•	 Consensus growth expectations are already priced into
equity valuations.  
>•	 GDP growth may not be a good proxy for earnings growth
in a world of multinational companies.  
>•	 Much of the market capitalisation growth in emerging markets
comes from share issuance rather than rising stock prices.  
>•	 Valuation, or the price paid for earnings growth, is a more
important driverof returns than economic growth.

Having said that, most analysts do expect emerging market outperformance, particularly relative to the US, over the next decade. They don't know though.
