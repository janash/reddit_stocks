1,RH," Why oh why would you ever flip the margin numbers so that a higher S&P price and higher margin are inverted in the graph? It makes it so confusing to read the graph.

Also, I'm going to have to disagree with Burry here, there's a few key components to the use of margin overtime that he's missing that makes this graph a lot less useful. 

* Brokers are more willing to give out margin today then they were in the past (see the criticism RH has gotten over giving out margin too easily, though they aren't the only ones to lower the requirements), so of course there's more margin today then a few decades ago.

* The prices of taking out margin have been going down overtime. RH made headlines just a few months ago for cutting their margin price down from 5% to 2.5%, which caused a bunch of people to speculate at reddit that you could double your profits by investing in a safe dividend paying stock with at least a 3% yield to pay off the margin expense. Also if RH is charging such low margin rates, how long do you think the other brokers can go without lowering their margin rates to?

Hence no matter what state the market is in, of course those two things would cause more people to be using margin these days. 

That said, I think Burry is right about one thing he's implying. The heavy use of margin is going to push the market to bigger highs, and then when it goes down it will push it down much more rapidly then it otherwise would have in the past as a bunch of over-leveraged investors get margin called and are forced to sell at bad prices.",ShadowLiberal,13,/r/investing/comments/loy4gr/michael_burry_the_market_is_dancing_on_a_knifes/go8kh9d/,0.086,0.862,0.052,-0.8557

5,CAN," I think what he's describing is that most people are quite leveraged. When you get a crash a lot of people are instantly margin called, which exasperates the selling on a macro level. If everyone was on a cash only account then a lot of people could ride out the swings. You were very wise to ride out the Covid March crash, but if you sold or were margin called you realized some nasty losses. Likely you did not re-time your re-entry and just got a haircut.

A lot of newer investors and market participants and FOMO means we are usually always max invested. I bet only 1/10 have say 15% of their portfolio in cash ready to buy a stock market sale/crash...

Anyway, this guy is not a prophet, and he might be right but he might be years ahead. He was years ahead on his big short and meanwhile the party kept going. Don't try to time the market. What you CAN do is keep some cash aside, and don't buy on margin.

&#x200B;

EDIT: I will also add that I do not think we will see a crash for 1-2 years just because the government will stop at nothing to restore employment, and we're still a ways off from recovery. They've also found that direct household stimulus is the greatest way to stimulate ever and they will continue hitting this button for a while.

8,RE," There's been talks of a crash since August.  I'm not buying the FUD until it actually starts, but even then I don't believe we're in for an overnight crash, because even then the Fed is clearly motivated to keep printing into a slow correction. Let's see the narratives:

1. Retail investors are hyping everything into euphoria-- okay, but more stimulus checks are coming and Yellen is pushing a $1.9 TRILLION plan across the board. 

2. Sure but that's already ""priced in"" by the HFs -- okay but if that's the case then wouldn't that suggest it's institutions driving, and not retail investors? Is it unsophisticated Robin Hood traders or is it analysts?

3. The bubble is also fuelled with low interest rates. Okay, so is that going to change? RE prices are off the charts right now as well because of low mortgage costs.

Overall I still see US stocks as the ones where the most gains can be made by far currently, but more risky in the scenario of a global market crash. Again, assuming a correction is coming which was the whole basis of the comment I was replying to. If you're feeling paranoid right now I would shift more assets to emerging and EU since the drop *seems* (I'm not a expert nor have I the capability to see into the future) like it would be less drastic if a worldwide drop even happens.

29,BB," So, here's the rub.

We legit had a crash early into the COVID Pandemic, but the first round of stimulus gave out enough money to the populace to stave off immediate fears and it gave out very, very large sums of money to businesses.  I'm qualifying ""Big Business (BB)"" as any business who could afford to risk at least half of their stimulus package in the stock market.

BB took that money and invested it in various fashions - everything from payroll to shares buybacks and exec bonuses.

A LOT of money was reinvested into the market, and this in turn raised the avg stock price, which in turn raised the major market indexes, and, ""oh look, see, the market rebounded!""

So it **looks** like an economic recovery, but only if you use the stock market indexes as an index for the economy.

46,EV," This is the best advice I’ve heard. You should have a split between safe investments and riskier investments. 

Safe would be ETF’s and Blue Chips. 

Riskier would be individual stocks. 

The split is up to you and your comfort level. The younger you are the higher % in riskier. 

In the safe investments category you should definitely have S&P.  But I really like sector ETF’s. There are some for 5G, E-Sports, Green Energy, Online Gambling, EV, Etc....lots of opportunity. So just think what areas will be bigger in 10 years. Just know those are a little riskier. Some blue chips might include:
Amazon, Apple, Disney, JPMorgan.....

Then for the “riskier” investments. These are the fun ones. Lots of opportunities here. I don’t recommend messing with meme or penny stocks here. Just smaller companies that you’ve heard of, support or think will do well.

47,USA," There is nothing wrong with buying individual stocks. An index fund will only give you average returns in comparison to the growth of the entire market. However over the long term it has been proven that most individual investors or mutual funds lose to a broad based index fund such as s&p500, or a total market index fund.

The positives of a broad based index fund include small fees compared to mutual funds. The dividend that is paid out by companies usually gets added to the value of the fund, which can be useful for tax reasons, especially for those living outside the USA.

Also the index fund will do periodic rebalancing while the market keeps changing. If you buy your own stocks you would have to do this on your own as well. Overall picking individual stocks will be more work than a diversified portfolio of a couple of broad based index funds, while in most cases not resulting in better growth.

If you are interested in learning more, I would advice you to look for the writings and videos of JL Collins, or John Bogle, who founded vanguard, which offers a wide variety of index funds with low fees.",DBTroll,5,/r/investing/comments/losjcq/buying_sp_instead_tons_of_stocks_for_long_term/go7kzia/,0.034,0.865,0.101,0.9193

Example of a very low duration stock...Corecivic, the private prison company that puts Mexicans in cages. Dividend is currently 25%. Million dollar question is how many years they have left before going out of business: 2, 4, 8? They need to survive for 4 years and maintain dividend for investors to come out ahead.

63,CDK," Multiple CDK 4/6 inhibitors by pharma giants like Pfizer and Lilly are already approved for breast cancer and are currently being studied in other malignancies. It seems disingenuous to present this as a first in class drug because it certainly isn’t, it’s fourth behind palbociclib, ribociclib, and abemaciclib, which are already approved for breast cancer so I very highly
doubt “the goldmine grows tenfold” if it were to get an indication for breast. While it’s first to be approved for lung cancer, the others are already in trials for other malignancies like lung. I think that there will certainly be room for some modest upside, but in my opinion this is another me-too drug and not necessarily groundbreaking.

I only have a few grand in the portfolio, and am planning on rolling it into an IRA when I leave so I can manage it and place it into stable Vanguard index funds. 

That being said, I opened a taxable brokerage account on E-Trade in September and am seeing phenomenal gains. I’ve been trying to contribute 100 or so dollars here and there, and figured that I can afford to be more risky / aggressive with the money I invest here. I also purposefully have chosen to invest in industries that I believe in. Here is the investment breakdown:

APHA - 5 shares - Paid $4.55 per share - Currently $20.25 per share

ARKF - 1 share - Paid $48.21 per share - Currently $62.64 per share

ARKG - 1 share - Paid $111.00 per share - Currently $107.46 per share

ARKK - 1 share - Paid $86.66 per share - Currently $152.61 per share

CARR - 1 share - Paid $29.40 per share - Currently $37.64 per share

CLNE - 10 shares - Paid $2.55 per share - Currently $14.98 per share 

ICLN - 2 shares - Paid $23.93 per share - Currently $28.49 per share

PFE - 1 share - Paid $36.36 per share - Currently $34.44 per share

VFF - 2 shares - Paid $10.03 per share - Currently $17.085 per share

Account Value: $759.73
Total Gain: $309.18
Total Percentage Gain: 72.27%

For context, I have about 16k in a savings account, a few grand in my checking account, and about 20k in federal loans from my undergraduate degree. My undergraduate loans have been at 0% interest since the pandemic started and I have still been paying the full amount every month. I don’t anticipate taking out any loans for my law school education due to a scholarship I received, but need to stay fairly liquid to cover other expenses I will incur while back in school. I plan to invest significantly more once I graduate.

Financials do not appear to be strong.  Could that possibly be due to the public opinion of police over the summer.

My question is, if I have about $100-200 to invest each month for the next, probably three years and then probably $250-$300/month, and hope to retire in 20ish years, is there a best strategy or type of fund I should be looking at?

Help me understand one thing about limit orders. Do they always fill AT the price you set? Or is that just the min/max for the fill?

For example, let's say that Stock A is currently at a market price of $50. I set a buy limit order for $80. What happens? Do I get my shares at $50 each? Or at $80 each?

Same thing with sell limit orders. If I set a sell limit at $60, but the current price is at $80, do I get $60 per share or $80?",Crixomix,1,/r/investing/comments/lotzex/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/go8rpw1/,0.023,0.9,0.076,0.6136

92,DCF,"  

Currently trying to do a DCF analysis for the first time on Ahold Delhaize.

I have found that Ahold Delhaize has increased its FCF by an average of 9.28% from 2007 to 2019. As of 2019 they had 1.843 million euros free cash flow. Divided amongst 1.088 million shares that gives 1.694 euros of FCF per share.

Assuming Ahold Delhaize will keep increasing its FCF with 9% a year and assuming I would otherwise put the money in vwrl which is expected to return \~7% every year, I calculated the DCF.

When assuming I will hold ahold delhaize for 5 years, I came out at a DCF value of 8.955 euros.

Since the share is going for around 22 euros. The net present value -13.045, and thus the investment is not worth it if I were to keep it for 5 years.

Couple of questions, am I right for discounting my investment in ahold delhaize with the return of where I personally would put my money elsewhere? I currently haven't got enough free time to compare a lot of different stocks with eachother and so I check a stock about once every two weeks, I put in money in my portfolio every month and if I haven't found anything I will put it in vwrl.

Ahold Delhaize is planning to buy back shares, should I account for this by multiplying the FCF with old\_qty / new\_qty?

Is it safe to assume that DCF is a good way of calculating the actual value of the investment? What if the majority of people are ignoring the FCF in valuating Ahold Delhaize and I'm missing out on the actual thing people value it by? I'm not talking about that the FCF isn't growing at the magnitude you predicted it to grow at. I'm talking about what if people are holding Ahold Delhaize for their real estate, or purely for their dividends?

Is it possible to take into account for the fact that right now I would be paying 22 euros for 1.694 euros of their free cash flow and should I take it into account? Say I'm right now paying 13x the price of the FCF, can/should I assume that I will sell for 13x the FCF of the future?

This account is intended to build me some wealth, so I can set a large portion aside(likely through VOO) for long term growth, but also be able to pull from it for needs/wants. All of this is obviously dependent on performance.

96,TC," Just filed my taxes and am getting about $5000 back so I started up an Ameritrade account and am going to load that money into it to start my portfolio. The reason I got so much back is that I graduated college in 2020 so that entire year my only income was from my signing bonus basically. 

I just started my job in January and am making about $100,000 TC. I am already contributing about $1000 a month in Roth contributions to a 401k, and currently have 100% of that set to a target date fund. This $5000 would just be myself managing my money, not necessarily for retirement (perhaps to buy a house one day). 

My question is basically how should I go about investing this first $5000. Should I buy mostly individual blue-chip stocks because I already have the 401k in an index fund?

116,RH," If RH charges an ""exit fee"", the only way to avoid it is not open an account with RH in the first place.  Since it's too late for that, you'll have to suck that one up.

There are no typical fees for other parts of the transaction, -as long as- you initiate the transfer from the -receiving- firm -- the new account.  That's the way that ""ACATS"" transfers are set up to work, and thus that's the way they work the best.  You'll specify a ""Transfer in Kind"", which means all your holdings will transfer, in general, ""as is"".

There are exceptions.  Although you can hold partial shares of most equities now, you may not be able to -transfer- fractional shares.  So, after the whole shares transfer, you may have to sell the partials manually and transfer the cash.

Likewise, make sure there is enough cash in the account to cover the exit fee -- you can't duck it by not having it.  (In that case, the $75 debit will ALSO transfer to your new account -- the system is very thorough!)",DeeDee_Z,1,/r/investing/comments/lotzex/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/go9brrj/,0.048,0.883,0.069,0.6114

160,IMO," The economy is in recovery and in these instances the fed is supposed to lever the interest rate to prevent 'overheating' - ie the breakdown of economic mechanisms in the face of rapid fluctuations. This is coupled with a general feeling in finance that we're due for a stock market correction, in part because the market fears fiscal policy will eventually taper off as the government is forced to tackle its balance sheet. However, the fed continues to say it is reticent to repeat the mistakes of 2007/08 when fiscal and monetary stimulus proved insufficient, resulting in a prolonged lackluster recovery and permanent loss in potential gdp.

Recessions, as well as stock market corrections, are an inevitable component of the global economic cycle. If you're able to predict when and where they'll occur, congratulations, you'll soon be a trillionaire.

And we do this because we recognize each other's strengths and weaknesses.  If she was in charge of investing, we'd likely be 70% in bank CDs.  If she knew I bought GME at $12.00, she would have been on my case to sell it when it hit $15.00.

> I noticed that most of the infidelity cases I've read were caused by male partners

It's a well researched fact that men are more risk tolerant that women, so men are clearly going to be the ones making riskier investments.  There is just an overall gender gap in investing and this is just one manifestation of it.

What about the other side?  There are tons of people - certainly hundreds of thousand if not millions - who made $10,000 or more in the past month trading GME.  And I guarantee you that there is a huge gender gap in who made that money.  It wouldn't surprise me if 90%+ of the ""winners"" on GME stock were men.  What are we doing to correct that imbalance?

> The results is that some of the woman decide, rightly so, to keep some of their earnings from their husbands

LOL.  Classic.  When women commit financial infidelity, they do so ""rightly"".  When men do it, their heathens.

Going back to my prior example, did I not ""rightly"" keep my $12.00 GME purchase from my wife because I would have missed out on massive gains by selling at $15.00?

> Thinking about this, what are the strategies which you use or plan to use when consolidating a relationship, in order to create Couple Savings while also protecting your own wealth as an individual? Which rules do you consider essential when dealing with shared finances and investments?

Don't get married to someone you don't trust.  If you marry someone and your trust is misplaced, it's going to bite you in the ass eventually one way or another.  There's no way to avoid it, so just do your best to evaluate your partner's trustworthiness and then trust that evaluation.

It's the best he can do to protect their wealth, as none of them have communication skills to solve the situation ideally.

As for you GME situation, you seem to know what you are doing and how to do risk management, and your wife is at an agreement with your overall strategies, so I don't think your case fits the ones I mentioned.
