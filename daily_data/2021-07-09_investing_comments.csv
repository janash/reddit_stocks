The comments you guys made statements not being wrong doesn't mean OP on the opinion is incorrect.

* recent US history 1973+ has shown that during market turn downs the fed will try and create an artificial floor under the market. You can benefit from this buy purchasing gold and silver or mining companies. This always works as an inflation play. 

Gold/Silver have seen lower downturn, quicker rebound, and higher upside than the S&P500. From Feb/2020 to Apr/2020. Not only the S&P but also the FAAAM members. 

We'll use GOOG for example: Was at $1500 dropped to around $1000. Reached pre-covid $1500 price on July/2020. Compare that to Gold which was at $1600 bottomed at $1400 range. Retested $1600 in March. Dipped to $1580 before spiking to $1750. At the $2000 range by Jul-Aug/2020. Silver was $18 in Feb. $12 at bottom. Recovered to $18 by May. $27 by July/Aug.

Buffett himself had the same reserves about talk about how BTC/Gold/Silver don't create anything of value in of themselves and you're just buying a non-producing asset as a hedge that you hope another person will pay more for than you. But OP's advice is to buy gold/silver physical **OR MINERS** as a hedge against a downturn isn't wrong. Buffett/Berkshire themselves bought gold miner Barrick Gold and exited their position in Q2-Q3 of 2020. 

Silver is often locked in step with gold. https://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/09/gold-silver-ration.asp But for the case of a downturn, I'd say just buy gold or miners. Only reason to go into silver is to play the ratio correction OR some industrial trade play like the silver battery trade.

p.s. that doesn't mean I'm telling anyone to buy gold, silver, or gold/silver miners. I think we're in early cycle, on a bullish trajectory, and will have small corrections at best. As such the benefits gold/miners will have is marginal at best and most likely won't beat out holding something like VOO. The only ones who should are those with too much cash to know what to do with. So they hold gold/silver/miners instead of cash during an inflationary period where you don't want to lock in near 0 rate bonds under inflation rate before an expected rate hike.",zxc123zxc123,1,/r/investing/comments/ogkoau/ive_seen_several_post_worries_about_a_market/h4m2c12/,0.027,0.854,0.119,0.9895

52,AMZN," >Amazon (AMZN) was unprofitable for 20+ years. Sure, ultimately their aggressive strategy paid off, but it could as well simply have had failed.

In the case of AMZN, it's important to look at *why* they weren't profitable, and not consider profitability as a simple either/or condition.

In Amazon's case, they had good (and later great) revenue, and constant revenue growth; they weren't profitable because they took their increasing revenue and invested it in building new warehouses and other facilities, which further increased revenue, which was used for even more new facilities, etc. 

Amazon was (almost) always capable of making a considerable profit in a given year if they didn't spend as much as they did on discretionary expansion. 

Not making a profit because you choose spend revenues on increasing revenue is different from a company which doesn't make a profit because its revenues are not sufficient to cover its non-discretionary costs (Uber, and many other companies too numerous to mention). 

Investors who paid attention were aware of the reasons why Amazon wasn't making a profit, and were okay with it.

Not being *able* to make a profit until you can achieve a certain market share may also pay off...but you may never achieve that market share, or it may end up not being as lucrative as you expect.

Which is not to say that Amazon was or is destined for success...just that ""profit"" is more complicated than it seems when it comes to investing. (And so is P/E, for the same reason).",thewimsey,2,/r/investing/comments/ogwlhg/benjamin_grahams_followers_often_state_that_a/h4mdl0s/,0.055,0.753,0.193,0.9899

2. If markets are not moving or when the outlook isn't look too good, they will emphasize on hedging strategies, fixed income ..etc, they do not care a short term (read: 1 YR) downturn, they care about a long-ass which works for their less sophisticated clients in fairness.

Now the Capital Markets arm of the bank is not allowed any communication to their AM arm, they have a strict Chinese wall, and this is where they will be working on advanced derivative strategies to hedge themselves on currency/interest/market risks, these guys however will never publish their real outlook though.",GreyMatter22,2,/r/investing/comments/ogt4jf/jpm_q3_guide_to_the_markets/h4ls4zw/,0.058,0.836,0.106,0.7864

If you're going to see a few dozen homes prior to buying one no one wants to pay a fee for that and no one wants to pay a $3000 or higher fee to the buyer's agent that you use to buy that home.

&#x200B;

sellers paying the cost is the easiest way to pay for the 90% of the time that realtors waste on people who never put an offer in and the other costs of running their business

&#x200B;

for NYC rentals it's actually the opposite. the landlord finds an agent to list the rental and the renter pays 15% of the year's rent along with first month and security deposit when signing a lease.

107,GS," Looking at the GS Commodity Index ETF (to use a broad basket commodity product as an example), it lost 49% between the start of 2020 and the bottom in April. In 2008, ""The Reuters/Jefferies Commodity Index plunged by 23% in October, its steepest monthly decline since 1956.""

Gold has held up better, but still has had multiple significant drawdowns, including 	

Start	End	Length	Recovery By	Recovery Time	Underwater Period	Drawdown
	Mar 2008	Oct 2008	8 months	May 2009	7 months	1 year 3 months	-25.83%

There was also a decline in gold that lasted for 4 years between 2011 and 2015. Oil prices cratered in 2020 to the point where they briefly went negative. 

And I guess I view ""defending against a market crash"" as something along the lines of say, Walmart. Or increasing cash. Or a more complicated option would be something like managed futures (although this sub would likely not be interested in any alternative strategy, given the views on expense ratios here.) REMIX (which, great symbol) is a mutual fund managed futures example that largely avoided the decline in early 2020, then - for an alternative strategy - went on to do very well.

It not owning commodities that will still probably lose a lot (depending on the commodity and the nature of the market crash, just not as much as the market) - honestly, in that case I'd rather continue to own the market if I'm going to ""lose a lot but maybe not quite as much."" 

If I'm owning commodities, I'm owning them as a trade and now I've created a decision for myself because I now have to time selling commodities and getting back into stocks.

Also, a lot of commodity futures ETFs are structured as MLPs, which are not something I'd recommend owning, especially for a trade.

Lastly, I've read ""market crash"" on here thousands of times over the last 5+ years and the majority of those proclamations have been spectacularly wrong - then when there actually have been major drawdowns (late 2018, March 2020), at the bottom half this sub is acting like the world's going to end and are *certain* that the market has much further lower to go - then there's a collective tantrum when the market rebounds.",dvdmovie1,4,/r/investing/comments/ogroyz/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/h4m84zl/,0.109,0.827,0.064,-0.9575

117,GE," Rebalancing should be a way to reposition your account to capture growth going forward.  Repositioning so you can keep doing more of what didn't work will probably lead to more losses.  Having losses aren't a bad thing if you itemize on your taxes, because you can net them out against gains, and losses can be carried forward into future tax years if for some reason you end up with a loss on the year.  Let's just say I learned a whole lot about that in 2000-2001; I also learned a whole lot of things about how to hurt myself with leverage and options then too.  I moved on and didn't repeat the mistakes.

With individual stocks I recommend everyone has their own annual price target for the stock and that you reevaluate that every quarterly report.  how else do you know if they are buy/hold/sell?  if they are in the buy zone, don't sell them.  if in the sell zone, don't keep them around.  you should evaluate your individual stocks and figure out whether they have annual appreciation available above ""the market""... that would be job one.  And don't just assume that because they are a household name they are automatically going to keep going up.  Companies do lose their way over long periods of time.  GE was the one stock to own in everyone's portfolio at one point... and it is basically stock market roadkill even though it is still surviving.

You don't mention what the other 50% of the account is, but you should probably take this as a good learning experience and decide to build something diversified as your core portfolio.  i.e. broad global market based.  you still have over 23 years to go before you might need cash flow from retirement accounts which is plenty of time for the market to work in your favor...  and position your retirement accounts similarly.

119,CF," If they are claiming a 10mm valuation and selling 10% of the business. So that means it's a 1mm capital raise. It looks a Reg CF cap raise which as a max of 5mm raise in a 12 month period which is exempt from SEC registration.

Doing a direct raise and staying an LLC seems like a bad idea because the company has to generate a K-1 for all shareholders each year. And the shareholder now has to file that K-1.

Hopefully - they are using a Reg CF broker that helped with the offering or they engaged a securities counsel.

As for the valuation - that's all very subjective in any startup. Startup valuations can be highly speculative. Really depends more on their revenue model and growth plans.

But without more information - it doesn't seem like anything out of the ordinary.

\[edit\] - btw - I found the company that you are asking about. I assume it's YoReSpot. On the surface - that 10mm valuation seems ridiculously high for the kind of business they are running. It looks like the revenue model is purely based on advertising. And their target audience looks very narrow based on the content that I saw and the current advertizers.

120,VC," I wouldn't say they are selling stocks. Ownership of the private company is divided into shares, which have a direct correlation with percentage ownership of the company. This is very common for LLCs and pass-through investment vehicles that own LLCs. All the company is doing is selling ownership of the company in the LLC and using the word ""shares"" as a way to simplify the transaction and/or make it more attractive to potential investors. Stocks imply liquidity and a public market, but that is not the case here. To me, the legality of this is not really in question - I think it is perfectly legal - but their tone and delivery method is what would make me run at a full sprint in the opposite direction. If you want some color from someone with a background in early stage financing, acquisitions, and debt-structuring, read below. 

Any member of an LLC can sell shares at any time so long as doing so conforms with the company's Operating Agreement. A company  (or individual that owns a portion of the company) can value itself (or the portion the individual owns) at any number it wants, as someone said, valuation is arbitrary. This is especially true for early-round funding and private companies in general. 

That being said, don't invest if you don't like the value. But, if you're curious, you could ask to  have a look at their Operating Agreement to see what rights you would have as a member (likely none, as members are purely capital and member-managers or managers are the decision makers). You could also ask for historical financials, budget, and a business plan for their use of the funds. If the company won't provide one of those things, then that's a big red flag.

The company's rhetoric of how much money you could make when it goes public sits wrong with me and should be a red flag, too. No legitimate company would sell itself in that manner. The potential value upon IPO is understood by private investors and is why early stage investors exist. Also, this amount of capital is rarely raised from multiple investors via email. Asking for this much would usually involve one or two larger players in the VC space, or just individual investors that have an appetite for the company. It makes me think they have tried to raise capital in a more efficient manner already and nobody was interested, so the company is now reaching out to a captive audience - its users.

To me, this looks like the owners of the company want/need money and their goal is to get $1MM worth. To do so, they sent an email to their loyal users that may or may not know how investing works. Once enough users buy shares, the owners will make some money and then the business will fail. The company likely won't make it to IPO with such a low user count, the public market has no interest in that, so the user base that invested in shares will be left with $0 worth of ownership in the company.",CrossedApex06,1,/r/investing/comments/ogxvv0/small_social_media_website_is_selling_stock/h4mjb81/,0.04,0.835,0.125,0.9927
