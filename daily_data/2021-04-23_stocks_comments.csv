1. Lack of innovation due to a passive culture. (People would rather get a ""safe"" job than start the next revolutionary EV company that could make billions)
2. Conservative approach to financial investments. (No one's going all in on the market to capitalize on some big opportunity, so prices aren't going up)
3. The 1990's was the ""peak"" of Japan. (They were really big. It felt like they were going to take over the world. But since then, there haven't been companies more successful than Toyota, Sony, etc. Add low immigration rate and declining birth rate to the mix. Now there aren't enough workers to replace older populations soon to retire, so Japan's GDP continues to fight to stay in the top 3)

104,CLF,"  

There are a few factors that lead me to believe the steel industry is just getting started in a big way. First, obviously, is the reopening of economies across the globe post-pandemic. My dad heads the service department of a major construction company and the amount of work they have right now just delayed his retirement by two years.

Secondly, I don't know if anyone else has noticed, but our natural disaster rate has increased dramatically. Every time I turn around we're getting wrecked by another hurricane, massive fires, deep freezes in places not equipped for it, or tornadoes blowing through towns. After every disaster is another rebuild.

Tech: semiconductor shortage lasting longer than expected, overvaluation, oversaturation.

Pharma: picking a winning pharma company is like trying to win the lottery (I have 30 shares of Moderna, but I didn't get in till they were at $100/share and it's come down to near my entry point three times already since I bought)

Banking: The rise of those other gimmicky currencies 

Real Estate: increasing interest rates, sky-high commodities prices (lumber, steel)

Cannabis: failure to pass federal legalization, longer than expected route to profitability, overcrowding of the sector.

Clean energy: I like this sector, but it is in a prolonged period of retraction, and I just don't know when it's going to turn around again. I got stop-lossed out of NIO, and I entered Li Auto at what I thought was the bottom ($25/share) only to be sitting at $20 now.

There are a few factors that lead me to believe the steel industry is just getting started in a big way. First, obviously, is the reopening of economies across the globe post-pandemic. My dad heads the service department of a major construction company and the amount of work they have right now just delayed his retirement by two years.

Secondly, I don't know if anyone else has noticed, but our natural disaster rate has increased dramatically. Every time I turn around we're getting wrecked by another hurricane, massive fires, deep freezes in places not equipped for it, or tornadoes blowing through towns. After every disaster is another rebuild.

I honestly don't know wtf qualifies to you as a bullish sign educationalgrass.  I don't think you have actually done anything more than look at the chart and then offer generalizations and platitudes to try to naysay every positive factor brought up about CLF.

Personally, I don't have a stake in CLF, but after reading about what they have done in the last year, I am a fan.

145,HRC," I sold out all but my gain of the stock, but from what it was before the offline would remain offline as they shift repair shutdowns to different areas. What it would impact is more demand for a longer period keeping the spot rate of steel higher. This is seen in the futures market. Many believe 4Q is when there will be a large fall off, but going into 1Q 2022 futures are already remaining at their high level. Check HRC futures. Separately for infrastructure there is some peculiar type of metal that only they create in the US that is needed for broadband which is part of the current proposed infrastructure plan.

As mentioned I sold my principal out still. I was a bit disappointed at the level of 1Q net income made on high HRC prices.

Thomas Farley, former president of the New York Stock Exchange, said the world of finance was ""past the point of no return"" on crypto following Coinbase's public listing last week.
In an interview with CNBC‚Äôs Squawk Box on Thursday, Farley said he was excited to talk about developments in the crypto space such as Coinbase‚Äôs COIN listing on stock exchanges and decentralized finance, or DeFi. The New York Stock Exchange president said he had invested $10 million in the crypto exchange on behalf of the NYSE back in 2013.

Coinbase (CB) is the premier crypto exchange in the US. For newcomers to crypto, CB will most likely be the obvious place for them to buy ‚Äúreal‚Äù crypto.

So as crypto gains more mainstream adoption, CB will gain the lion‚Äôs share of the new adopters and keep those users in the ecosystem with CB Pro. And most likely, BTC‚Äôs bull run will continue till later this year and approach or surpass $100k. That will likely spark major attention and a lot of speculative investment. 

Additionally, CB will be expanding to offer more services than an exchange. They already offer a digital wallet and will be offering BlockFi type interest accounts and lending.

173,COIN," CFRA Is generally a good analysis organization.  I read the full report this is a few snippets from a business insider story

CFRA Research believes Coinbase could surge 22% to $400 per share over the next 12 months.
Analyst Chris Kuiper, CFA, says institutional investors will buoy shares of Coinbase moving forward.
CFRA sees the crypto exchange ending the year with earnings per share of $6.81.

Coinbase could surge 22% due to the growing ""cryptoeconomy"" and a push to lure in more institutional clientele, CFRA Research says.

In a note to clients on Friday, CFRA analysts led by Chris Kuiper, CFA, initiated coverage on shares of Coinbase with a ""buy"" rating and a $400 12-month price target.

186,DD," I have to see I do greatly agree with you.
But I have to say that I‚Äôm one of those that do say ‚Äúbuy the dip‚Äù.

Its something that can be overused, and I get that. I try to explain it the best way I can.

For me buying the dip is if $ABC is at $30 and went down to $22 and the current valuation is lets say $50. Buying it at $30 is a good price but buying at $22 is definitely a dip. (of-course DD has to be done to know the reason it dipped also if evaluation is still accurate etc.) But buying at $22 and it goes back and even struggle to go above lets say $25/$30 you can still be profitable.

Now this is different depending if you‚Äôre day, swing, short or long term. Each has their own strategy: big difference between day trade and long term.

Imo buying the dip is getting in on a stock that has growing potential that by the time the dip ‚Äúmay‚Äù come you‚Äôll still be profitable.

I know and agree with you that last month price doesn‚Äôt mean it validates a future price. But with DD you can be more certain and correct in predicting.
We never know but DD is better than gambling.

Investing when the market is stable: Too big of a risk.     
Investing when the market is free-falling: Correct amount of risk.   

> So to be worth it to me, to risk losing it or to risk having to wait a long time to get it back, the reward needs to be greater.   

The reward is greater with longer term diversified investment than holding cash and trying to time the market.    

> I'm not going to spend my living buffer if my AC dies and I want to get a new unit  

So if you ""buy the dip"" your AC isn't allowed to die? But every other time it is allowed to die, and that is what that money is earmarked for?    

This post is self-contradictory, and it really has to be because the whole concept of ""buy the dip"" (time the market) and ""hold cash [somehow]"" is also flawed at its core, and as you poke at it, it collapses. Catching a falling knife isn't a good investment strategy, nor is holding money until the market is its least stable a way to avert risk.",TimeRemove,0,/r/stocks/comments/mwvtj7/people_tend_to_close_positions_when_they_have_no/gvl0rqw/,0.093,0.801,0.105,0.3869
189,GO," *Investing when the market is stable: Too big of a risk.Investing when the market is free-falling: Correct amount of risk*

**No. I am fully invested at the % of my assets that I am comfortable fully investing. I do not time the market or when I buy. I set it aside from my paychecks and at the end of the month I buy a couple shares. I don't even look at the graphs.**

*The reward is greater with longer term diversified investment than holding cash and trying to time the market.*

**That is why I do not wait and hold on to my money that I am willing to remain invested long term. I do not hold onto that money until 'the right time to buy'. I finish my monthly bills and then buy my shares.**

I don't understand why this concept is so difficult for others to understand. If I have 20k and I am willing to have 10k invested long-term in the stock market, then I put that money in the market. It's in there, it's fully invested. Money has more uses than 'investment'. There is 10k left. Let's say 6k is 3 month living buffer. Okay. Now 1k for various savings for car, etc. When all is said and done there is 3k left. What to do with that 3k? I don't want to invest it in the market, the 50% of my assets is the limit of what I want in the market. That 3k is an extended buffer with no designated role, it is flexible, I can use it how I decide to use it at any given time without impacting my investments or my living buffer/budgets.

To decide I want to GO OVER 50% INVESTED the reward needs to look pretty enough to me. I'm not saying to buy on a free-fall. Come on now. There are so many posts saying a 5-10% correction is healthy and normal. Seeing a -10% drop on funds I'm already in, and planning to remain in for the long term, would be enough for me to decide to go to 65% invested in the market, for a temporary period of time until it comes back up (which may even be 1 year, which is why it needs to be worth it to hold my cash for 1 year).

It is exactly RISK versus REWARD. The RISK is me not having my highly-valued extra cash on hand. I have a high value for cash, perhaps more than you do. That is fine. The REWARD needs to outweigh my high value of having some cash on hand to have freedom and flexibility to do whatever I want with it, whether that is temporary investing, or buying something, etc, there is no designed job for that money. If I lose it all, then I am not in danger, as I still have my emergency fund. It's money I dont need **NOW** but I might prefer to have it **LATER** within 1-2 years. Like I'm getting braces within a  year, I don't need that money **NOW** but I also don't want it tied up in the stock market for 6 months.",iwannastonk,6,/r/stocks/comments/mwvtj7/people_tend_to_close_positions_when_they_have_no/gvl3379/,0.039,0.871,0.09,0.9703

Check the run it had coming out of the March tech correction. Something like a $65 to $90+ run in less than three weeks? I was heavier on Etsy at the time and kinda surprised how much faster and stronger Pins bounced back from the March correction.

I managed to dump the rest of my cash into Pins yesterday 20 minutes before 1 pm lol and then had like a -5% swing on my portfolio going to 4. Pins is already back up above where I bought yesterday though thanks to Snap's earnings.

Bottom line to me is Pins already bounced back from yesterday's sell due thanks to Snap earnings, that after we were given a recent buy opportunity by one analyst that I saw some speculate as artificially created, and even if it doesn't run to $90 in two weeks again I would feel pretty damn safe recommending you look into this stock.",suphater,6,/r/stocks/comments/mwrgv5/rstocks_daily_discussion_fundamentals_friday_apr/gvjx9lf/,0.061,0.784,0.155,0.9759

Arkq and arkx (especially x) are a little premature if you ask me and AI regulations are a consideration. One thing to consider is if you want a lot of, or any, exposure to Tesla, as that‚Äôs the largest holding in k, q and w. F and G don‚Äôt have any exposure to Tesla.

It‚Äôs important to know that all of ark‚Äôs investments are fairly volatile because the entire point is that they‚Äôre speculative. There‚Äôs been a lot of negative sentiment surrounding ark recently because they‚Äôre buying into a lot of stocks that are hyped up on Reddit and they haven‚Äôt been growing since the tech correction a couple of months ago.

307,UK," Honestly the only change this will likely cause is the rich moving their money to where it needs to be long term. Children trusts potentially. For example, if you have ¬£100,000,000 currently in stocks you'll likely sell and move it into a family investment trust during the lower capital gains tax. You'll then repurchase the stocks within the investment trust, allowing your children to withdraw from the account in the future. If you keep a solid proportion as cash, they can withdraw tax free whilst the rest of the account grows through the investment stocks. The children will then potentially take the capital gains hit if they ever need to sell stocks to withdraw money, though this would probably be smaller than the ¬£100,000,000 taking the hit in its entirety. This also makes inheritance tax less of a pain in the ass in the UK.


Founders of companies may also sell off their shares whilst there is lower capital gains.

319,AMD," Imo, Nvidia is a great pick, but look at the semiconductor market; there are shortages that will last for 1-3 years. So Nvidia, AMD, Intel, etc. will have lower sales than expected due to this shortage for a while. 

Based on the massive performance uplift in Nvidia's new 3XXX GPUs, I am bullish on them. Nvidia has continued to be the company for GPUs for consumers. OEMs and system integrators are scared of AMD for some reason, which helps Nvidia's (& Intel's) sales. 

Some bearish stuff would be Apple and AMD. AMD has almost caught up with Nvidia in the last 3 years, which means that AMD will be taking market share away in the GPU market. Apple's M1 chips are the best in the market for power efficiency and relative performance, so I'd expect Apple to gain market share through their hardware.

324,AMD," Peter Lynch's ""rule of thumb"" for high PEs is that if you expect the company to grow earnings at a greater percentage than the PE in the next 3-5 years, it might be a good idea.

For me the question is then, do we as investors think that NVDA's earnings will double in 3 years? if so, it is a FAIR price for the current valuation. If that growth is expected to continue, then yes, the price of the stock is worth it.

NVDA has a lot of demand for their products, which is great.

337,AMD," Factories were shut down because of Covid. Then everyone was home bored buying electronics to entertain themselves. 

Yes it‚Äôs damn near impossible to get an nvidia GPU right now and yes they sell as soon as they hit the shelves, but there‚Äôs less of them. Every step along the way of manufacturing these chips is being bottlenecked by the company before them. 

‚ÄúBut lower supply, higher demand, they can charge more for their chips.‚Äù 

I‚Äôm almost certain these companies have contracts with each other to buy materials and components from them at a certain price. Nvidia can‚Äôt charge more for their cards because AMD will step in and charge less like they did to intel with their CPUs. Capitalism. 

If I‚Äôm wrong about one thing it‚Äôs the contracts between companies where the companies in line selling parts and materials to other companies at a fixed rate. Which is even worse for nvidia because they would be paying more for products and having to sell them at or around the same price. Higher manufacturing costs and lower revenue due to less supply. 

I get the argument of higher demand higher price thing, but it‚Äôs just not how it works. Especially if the price has to stay the same and the demand is being caused by not having enough product to sell. 

Worst part is it will not end soon. Car lots aren‚Äôt empty because they‚Äôre selling out of cars. Graphics cards aren‚Äôt impossible to find because they‚Äôre sold out. It‚Äôs because they can‚Äôt make them.",BoonstonkWanks,2,/r/stocks/comments/mwkitp/nvda_stock_discussion_whats_your_opinion/gvj1a67/,0.121,0.834,0.045,-0.9685

443,OR," There's a lot to go over here so I'll answer the easy questions. Yes, you can contribute $6K to your Roth IRA every year. Your money that you will contribute to it has already BEEN taxed (the way you wrote it makes it seem like you think you will specifically be taxed when you add it). Yes, you can pull out your contributions (but not the gains) without penalty.

Regarding order of contributions: Yes, it's great that you are getting the full employer match for the 401K. Yes, I would then max out the Roth IRA. And after that, you can either contribute more to your 401K for the tax advantage (but keep in mind that money cannot be touched until 60) OR you can put it in a taxable account instead (the advantage there is you can pull out the money whenever).",bigboybuckeyenuts,5,/r/stocks/comments/mwml9t/roth_ira_guidance/gvj3grj/,0.0,0.829,0.171,0.9744

I have a 401k that employer and i both pay 4% on (max employer match). But i also want to buy a house sometime in the next 2 years. 

I wanted to transfer my entire RH account to roth but that will involve alot of selling/capital gains taxes. Also Charles doesnt let me by fractional shares in spy/etfs while RH does and dollar cost averaging is my preferred method which becomes hard to do in there.

Im thinking maybe just take out 5k from RH, put it in the roth ira and turn on the robo advisor. Keep 5k in RH, then contribute 50/50 to each. But then im worried i might kick myself when tax time comes many years from now.

The supply chain got tore up from the floor up, and anyone in retail knows you can't sell an empty shelf, it's even worse when you simply don't have anything, and I mean ANYTHING, to put on it.  Check the back, why?  Yep, still echoes.  Hours of operation were reduced.  Occupancy limits were decreased (and tracked) during peak weekend shopping times.  NOBODY wants to use those self-checkouts with a $300 cart of groceries.  Black Friday was removed from the playbook (even though I called that shit the year before anyway), and for the first time in as long as I can remember, the doors got locked way more often than the normal once a year (6-8pm, Christmas Eve).

468,GILD, It is a challenge for a stock to break out over resistance ( that is why it is called resistance).

No one can predict the future; which is why one has to be patient and confirm a breakout.

469,SAFE," I'm in the same boat, and I've been skipping the international crowd in favor of the homefront. This seems like a good price point to get into MSOS, and I've been adding to my position there. With passage of the SAFE Banking Act and (too-many-to-count) politicians talking up American legalization with or without Biden, I think MSOS is a good play for when things change on the home front. Will that be this year? Maybe. But it could just as well be 5 years from now. Either way... when it happens, I believe MSOS is going to pop off much more so than the weed ETFs that are focused on Canadian equities (MJ, TOKE, CNBS, etc). MSOS is also actively managed FWIW, as is YOLO (same people). Although, I believe YOLO has its hands in the same Canada-specific companies that aren't going to show significant growth without a much bigger American customer. 

TL;dr- I think MSOS will have the steadiest growth and eventual returns of any weed ETF. Instead of splitting your attention, I'd put more eggs in the American weed basket now, while it's still quite affordable.

Fast forward to today and my new portfolio is established and balanced, and I decided to buy 5 shares of MJ at $20.

Make sure to **read footnotes** and explanations and google any terms you don't understand!

522,MA," Yes, both of them are involved in fintech. Visa has acquired some fintech companies recently. I just think that PayPal and Square have bigger growth potential, although they are valued higher than them too.

523,IMO, Debatable. And OP even says his dad can‚Äôt afford the risk he can because of his age. And obviously there‚Äôs a reason why his dad is skeptical of a market retraction... because he lacks time to ride them out. Which OP has plenty of. 40 is a hard age to judge risk IMO. He could be nearing retirement. Why would you take risk when you are near retirement. He‚Äôs a government employee he might get a pension which would give him more money to be more risky. Some people can afford to be risky at 40 and others can‚Äôt and others simply don‚Äôt need to be is my point.,SnooGrapes2628,1,/r/stocks/comments/mwyufg/beating_my_dad_at_his_own_game_how_i_got_into_etfs/gvloo9s/,0.128,0.872,0.0,-0.8803
524,DD," ETFs are just a vehicle for diversification, and are extremely useful for people who don't care to learn about every company they invest in.

I do my own DD for individual companies, and I buy ETFs for sectors that are too difficult to pick individual winners in (clean energy for example). 

An ETF will lower your risk, but also your reward potentially.",Viscoden,3,/r/stocks/comments/mx1h3d/etfs_for_boomers_or_na/gvlj5fw/,0.098,0.745,0.157,0.7212
525,VC," People seem to have this idea that startups and their founders won't be affected too much because they make hundreds of millions of dollars or billions.  Those are the lottery winners.  

The actual startup scene works like this: Three founders get angel financing and perhaps later money from a self-styled VC, one step up from angel financing.  They slave away for a few years.  The outcome of a successful endeavor is being acquired by a large company for $30MM.  That sounds like a lot but by this time the founders' ownership in the company is 15% each.  That is $4.5MM.  Long term taxes plus state taxes are \~$1.1MM, leaving $3.1MM for taking a huge risk, working seven days a week, and constantly thinking about the business' problem du jour when not working.

Under Biden's tax grab, the federal and state taxes total over 50%.  That leaves \~$2.25MM.  That is a radically different reward for the risk undertaken.  The reward goes from being marginally financially independent to retirement being set but you still need a job.  The whole equation of whether it is worth trying a startup changes.

That is the successful case.  That is not the typical venture that does not work out and the founders burn a huge amount of time and opportunity cost then crawl back into a corporate job while their former peers in that world have been promoted twice while they were gone.",TrioxinTwoFortyFive,4,/r/stocks/comments/mwlar0/bidens_tax_plans_and_stock_market_tanking/gvj67i2/,0.034,0.81,0.156,0.9838
526,GDP, Decreased investment in startups and new technologies will affect everyone's portfolios.  Company founders being hit with massive taxes for being successful will definitely leave a mark.  Long term this will decrease U.S. GDP growth and its job creation and its stock market.  You will be affected.,TrioxinTwoFortyFive,1,/r/stocks/comments/mwlar0/bidens_tax_plans_and_stock_market_tanking/gvj1d54/,0.053,0.736,0.211,0.8555
