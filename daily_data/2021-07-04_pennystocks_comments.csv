Need to highlight this again so copy pasting one of my comments:

‚Äú ATOSians go for shares not only options (options are riskier), if you want to average down such dips provide an opportunity for those with higher entries/positions.

For those who want to start a position I would recommend if they want to be conservative to go with 50% of the total amount that they want to invest and can do another 50% or 25% & 25%, in this way you go on a more defensive approach.
