198,CTXR, If referring to CTXR I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs late at all. But things to keep in mind. CTXR will most likely have a run up today during after hours due to the inclusion of the Russell 3000. Also the following week could see a pullback due to people taking gains. Lastly June 29th is the DMC review which will then be posted publicly within 5 business days. If the news is positive and we see a halt to the phase 3 trial of mino-lok CTXR could be mooning at the beginning of July whenever that‚Äôs announced. Let‚Äôs say they don‚Äôt halt it and decide CTXR should continue the phase 3 trial. CTXR will then most likely go down quite a bit. You would then see yourself wanting to hold until the end of this year for when the trial will be done and FDA approval will be requested (which they have a fast track to FDA approval).,Vallkev_,5,/r/pennystocks/comments/o7ffmo/the_loungedaily_plays_june_25_2021/h30cv2e/,0.0,0.923,0.077,0.9209

It really depends on the context of the company doing the split, like in the case of Gamestop who did an offering and stock price went up instead, versus GLBS which looks like a really troubled company. In the short run the stock price might go up again after the offering is completed, but be wary if you plan to hold the stock long term.
