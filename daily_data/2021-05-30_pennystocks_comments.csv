If itâ€™s not silver there are still plenty of other targets on the property, if it is silver then there should be a lot of it.

If you are a short term investor then I would think daily volume> 7 day volume and how many  folks are pumping it is most important.  The reason is its success is based on getting MORE folks in to buy your shares at a higher price then you paid for it, i.e. greater fool theory.  Nothing wrong with that but be honest and accept it is based on that and that alone.

If one is a long term investor there are a couple of ways to play it.  You can find a good company (based on whatever valuation metrics you want to use), buy/ hold it, and reap the growth or suffer the losses based on the company growing or not.  The other is, find companies young and prerevenue trying to do something  and bet on it doing x, y, z (catalyst)  IF it does it will go up a lot and if it doesn't it won't. 

Me, personally, I like the last one but is personal preference.  It just requires me to hold and do nothing with no guessing.

56,SLS," It was in December 2020, but since I haven't closed the position yet I will count it as valid. The stock is SLS and I entered during a literal P&D @ $12.50 [http://prntscr.com/13ls5ip](http://prntscr.com/13ls5ip) with about 80% of my buying power back then. I didn't sell and take gains when I could out of pure greed and watched how it plummeted afterwards. 

Of course, I didn't have a stop loss because I had never needed one so I got stuck in a -45% position more or less. At first, I wanted to sell out of pure panic emotion and close the account, but after I cooled down I did a serious DD con the stock and surprisingly I liked the company so I decided to stay. 

Now, 5 months afterwards I'm still holding and it's trading at $11.96 so I might end up with a profit and everything. I hope someone can learn from my past mistakes.

58,THC," Everyone here touting something probably has bought into those companies. My piece of advice? Find a company that was previously at a considerably higher price (think 300-800% higher), hasn't had any bad news in a while, and the VOLUME has been slowly decreasing. 

These types of stocks always ""pop"" and make sure you sell into that.

Don't look at penny stocks as something to hold long term unless you have found something with EXTREME potential.

I own shares in roughly 25 companies right now and the only one I have extreme confidence in is High Tide (HITID). They have been expanding at a RIDICULOUS pace, almost scary, this last year. They are in a market that is expected to have the highest growth in any sector over the next 10 years, they have added more than 25 physical locations in the last year, they are extending into the U.S. right now to take advantage of any opportunities from potential federal legalization, they are already PROFITABLE, they beat their expected EBITDA by 50% in their most recent financial filing from a month ago, they got added into the most predominant marijuana ETF in the world recently,

AND 

they just got APPROVAL to uplist to the NASDAQ, not just ""submitted"" for approval like some OTCs play around with.

I told people months ago about this stock and I'm sure many didn't listen.

They bought up the 1st, 2nd, AND 3rd largest marijuana/THC and MJ/THC accessories websites in the world all within the past year. This company is going to be a monster, and every time I make a comment about them I realize how stupid I am for not already jumping out of my other positions and weighting High Tide more heavily in my portfolio. Like I'm thinking about now lol.

I'm going to keep it unbiased here. The downside? They have diluted their shares a couple times over the past year in order to ""grow at a more rapid pace"" as the company claims. I see this as an amazing strategy in a growing sector, UNLESS they are lying and keep diluting after they slow down their physical store growth. Do I think they are lying? No. Could they be? Yes. That's the only downside I see, but lack of transparency is the name of the game in OTCs.",APastaFreeD,11,/r/pennystocks/comments/no2hc0/what_would_you_bet_on/gzy9szw/,0.052,0.852,0.096,0.9062
