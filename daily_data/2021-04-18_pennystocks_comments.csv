Out of all of them, only ONE can I say is truly a legitimate company that I've researched enough to almost guarantee it will make me a small fortune in the years to come.

27,NAV," FUNFF/[FANS.CN](https://FANS.CN) is presently shorted to under half its price a month ago. It's in the portfolio of VSQTF/VST.CN, which is trading under its NAV calculated on another site some time ago. VSQTF/VST.CN is also being shorted apparently by the same group that is shorting FUNFF/FANS.CN . The problem is short sellers love profitable or promising small caps and never leave. It makes the ride up slow and rough and the ride down fast and deep.

I have 30k of VSQTF/VST.CN. The company has a share buyback program and there is a yearly and monthly limit (designed by the TSX to protect short sellers, I think). It slows the descent but doesn't stop it. A dividend of a type of interest in a portfolio company has been announced but the date hasn't been announced.

I have 10k of FUNFF/FANS.CN and expect the short to finish on Monday unless someone pumps the stock and they can't cover. Because it's in the VSQTF/VST.CN portfolio, I think they can buy more stock without limit. If they take a larger position, that would be a pump. I hope to average down in the coming week.

35,ATH," DTGI is now more than just a long term play. 

I have been hot on DTGI for some time now, but as of Friday I am slapping the table. Currently sitting at 16 cents, 8 cents off the recent high of 24 cents when they released stellar YOY earnings and growth. 

Currently the market cap is $22 million, they are listed on the OTCQB, and the share structure is impeccable with 63 million shares on the float. 

They are currently in talks to expand their credit line with Post Road to $40 million for future acquisitions. They have set incredible goals for 2021, including applying to up list to a major exchange. Unlike most OTC companies, the team at DTGI has already proven they can get the job done. They took the company GlobalSCAPE from the OTC to the NYSE before selling it at $9.50 a share. 

I have full confidence in this play long term, I expect it to hit $1.50-$2.00 at least before the end of the year. For now, short term I think it could easily shoot back up to ATH. The level 2 walls are incredibly thin going all the way up to 21 cents. On Friday someone bought 100 shares 3 minutes before close and pushed the price back green.

So simple a 5 year old can get it! Thanks mayne!

62,CBD," I'm sure they have the resources, but even then the difference in regulations is pretty significant. I'm not saying you're wrong, but it's commonly overlooked when comparing CBD and THC products. It's like a soda company expanding to beer. I'm sure they're on top of it and have the resources, but even then permits in California (website looks like they're CA based) are a handful per county/city. Obtaining one of those is not easy if they don't already have one. 

I don't mean to be a nay-sayer, just giving my 2c on this 4c stock. I'll jump in but treading lightly. Hoping you traded your Model 3 for a SpaceX rocket. Godspeed",chubky,2,/r/pennystocks/comments/mt0j5f/yolo_fo_sho/gux2xu5/,0.033,0.733,0.233,0.9768
