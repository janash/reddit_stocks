3. GME has a reason to run up, AMC I don‚Äôt really know the reason...no hate here. BB is a real stock with real implication. If it wasn‚Äôt called BB it would be 100+ by now.
4. BB has been flat for months now. It has found its support. It should not go much lower from what it‚Äôs priced at now. So a bottom of 8$ and a high of 25+ that‚Äôs a no brainer.

133,BB," I like the stock long term and think it is a real company but I am worried for people seeing things that they want to see. And FOMO. If anyone wants to play BB I would buy shares.

233,ALL," Not quite right. You buy a $1000 contract from a construction company for the right but not the obligation to buy 10(ten) $100,000 houses in a new under construction neighborhood of 200 houses. Construction on those houses will be finished by Dec 1 2021 and you have until that date to decide whether you want to buy 10 of those houses at that price ($100,000). As construction continues, the prices of those houses go up and down because of the housing market and because people can start to see how those houses are looking as they are being completed. You can exercise your right to that contract at any time up until construction is complete, but once the construction is completed on Dec 1 2021, you have to decide if you want to exercise your right to buy those houses at $100,000 or that contract will void and you would‚Äôve paid $1,000 for nothing . You can also sell that contract to anyone else to give them the right to buy those houses at that price.

ANYONE can buy those houses, and they don‚Äôt have to buy your contract from you to buy any of those houses. In fact, someone can buy ALL of those houses in that neighborhood and there will be none left for sale, but luckily for you If you exercised your contract then the construction company that sold you that contract will be forced to buy 10 of those houses at whatever the price is at that time to sell to you because they wrote you that contract and they are obligated to fulfill it , even if they have to pay $1,000,000 per house out of their own pocket to hand them to you (ie example of a naked short)",Ureadyforacold1,5,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nnz670/from_march_to_friday_finally/gzxy9ti/,0.019,0.93,0.051,0.872

1. GME and AMC already has runs, not saying the runs are over but they‚Äôve had some runs. BB has yet to run. This is surprising as its grouped with the meme stocks.
2. BB market cap is a third of GME and half of AMC, so it‚Äôs that much easier to double.
3. GME has a reason to run up, AMC I don‚Äôt really know the reason...no hate here. BB is a real stock with real implication. If it wasn‚Äôt called BB it would be 100+ by now.

4. BB has been flat for months now. It has found its support. It should not go much lower from what it‚Äôs priced at now. So a bottom of 8$ and a high of 25+ that‚Äôs a no brainer. The risk is asymmetrical. I would buy shares because we don‚Äôt know when it will blow up, but when it dos there will be serious FOMO.

282,ALL," >why do you mention ""penalties""?

Fees (which have been waived recently but will definitely rise back up) and negative rates.

>Are MMF forced to invest somewhere ALL the cash they have

Even if they hold onto the cash, they have to deposit it at a bank (notes and currencies are a no go). Banks have been turning away deposits from funds and other wholesale entities due to the SLR relief ending (effectively increasing capital requirements for banks to hold against their total liabilities/assets), so if banks charge the MMFs negative rates, they go to repo. If the repo market charges them negative rates, they go to the Fed for ON RRP.

There are also prime funds that offer commercial papers and multiple-bank deposits etc but that's less secure than your vanilla Tsy MMFs.

Think of ON RRP as a way to temporarily hoover some of the excess reserves out of the system.

354,DD," well that's certainly true - I was talking about individual ordinary shares NIO Inc ADR ..  not options .. but if you want to talk about options , go ahead, what do you have to say?

NIO will be worth 200 dollars a share, in a while .. if you buy shares at 36 on Thursday when the weekly trailing price sag (often) reaches it's low  and then sell them at 37-38 on Monday, you'll make 2 dollars. If you keep them until they go up to 200 you will be holding long, but that will TEND to move the midweek and the overall spot action a bit higher a bit faster from week to week, and you'll reach your 200 sooner. (if enough folk take that view)

So it's down to you if you buy/sell 5 or 10 times and so (hopefully) make 2 dollars per cycle, or hold 5 / 10 weeks and (hopefully) make 200.

There is a kind of ""best price"" for retail traders in any share, the point where you feel you can do MOST with that share.. .. eg you don't seek out penny stocks and you don't chase 870 dollar-a-hit shares (mainly)..  many retail folk have a share price they're most comfortable with, if they think about it...   it rings a bell in them when shares are in that price range ..

just a feeling, ya know.. look and you'll see it's there ..

so its maybe tempting to make your 2 dollars on a share now, rather than put the time and ""effort"" into going for 200 ""in a while""

need to see how you think yourself, and work that out with a pencil, too.. hmm?

for me, IMO -  I expect NIO will go to 200.. I get off at 140.   
And THAT'S because I want that liquid for another project, so I don't want NIO to take forever to go where it's going.

But hell, it's a long winner no doubt at all, I'll wait if I have to, I'd just rather not. After 150-200 I don't know what will happen to NIO.  Out there the DD looks good.

376,IRS," I think it is becasue the first two are 'futures'.

If you trade futures (on any index, gold, oil, bonds ect) and you are considered a 'trader' then you get taxed 60/40.  The IRS definition of a 'trader' needs looking into.  Probably if you don't make a lot then technically you might not be considered a 'trader', but the IRS probably doesn't care.  Certainly if you make a decent proportion of your income from trading futures and trade them regularly, then you are considered a 'trader' can use the 60/40 rule.

I am not a financial advisor this is not advice on how to claim your taxes, but maybe some into to get you started in finding out.

382,LAC," I'm also hard for lithium. I see your LAC and raise you  GALXF. Here's what some professional analysts (can't say who without getting smacked apparently) say about GALXF. 

""The stock lies in the middle of a very wide and strong rising trend in the short term and a further rise within the trend is signaled. Given the current short-term trend, the stock is expected to rise 71.22% during the next 3 months and, with a 90% probability hold a price between $4.65 and $6.04 at the end of this 3-month period.""

OROCF is also looking promising, though I'm not privy to the potential draw-backs for this company. OROCF is expected to rise 51.99% during the next 3 months and, with a 90% probability hold a price between $7.29 and $9.39 at the end of this 3-month period.

I own small stakes in both aforementioned companies. I'll be adding to my positions in the near future.

497,BBBY, ... didn't BBBY already have a short squeeze like in January/February? It was one of the reopening plays. It was right in the middle of GME's first squeeze.

498,AMC," I have been thinking about BBBY as a recovery play. Also, because it has a lot of short interest.If the consumer discretionary or staples markets turn around in the next few weeks companies like BBBY or BYND could start to go up in price even if a bunch of reddit traders don't pile in. If some of them do it could be even better.I know people are attached to AMC and GME but I wonder if they should consider the possibility that retail traders sell every chance they get when the price goes up and AMC and GME might not have much room to grow.Stocks like BBBY and BYND are trading at reasonable prices and could be more entry level squeeze positions at current prices. Also general market conditions in the next couple months may be more favorable to BBBY and BYND.For the record I went all in on BYND with my speculative account, my fun money.  I'm considering putting a small amount in BBBY. I do think Jim Cramer recommending BYND on Mad Money could be a big advantage because it will attract people that would never get involved in this kind of trading strategy.",Isometricpressure,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/no0ixl/why_is_no_one_talking_about_bbby/h005pb9/,0.021,0.856,0.124,0.9601
