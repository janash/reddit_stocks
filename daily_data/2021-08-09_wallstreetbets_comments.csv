I'm no DFV, but I created a new throwaway to post my proudest (financial) achievement. I had to wait 2 months for submission requirements, then this keeps getting removed because ""A Gain/Loss/YOLO should be a picture of a closed gain, a closed loss, or an open position > $2,500."" which I think this clearly qualifies for. Maybe it's because it has to be a picture submission? Let's see if this works.

&#x200B;

**Background:** I wasn't a trust fund baby, we grew up relatively poor and I was always hungry. I started working in high school to support my family, and worked 3-5 jobs through college, graduating with loads of student debt. While I have a steady job now, there's no way I would be able to grind my way to financial freedom. The system is too broken for that.

&#x200B;

**At the Beginning:** I read DFV's DD on GME after their last Nov earnings. I told everyone about GME when it was at $17, and at $14, but as many apes here know, it's hard to convince people even when the DD and facts are out in plain sight. I recognized it as a once in a lifetime opportunity, so I dumped the rest of my gambling money (roughly $15k from an original $30k borrowed from a LOC) into GME options. Lost most of it over the next month or so, but then saw this $1.4B company make $1.7B in profit, so I took a $20k credit card cash advance and kept playing. At my lowest, I was down from $50k to $15k, and then the money started raining.

&#x200B;

**The Rollercoaster:** Like everyone else, I checked the price constantly. Post-market until 8pm, read DD until midnight, and watching the German / pre-market prices a few hours later (Thank you German apes!). I saw the price go up to $480+ and \*knew\* it was going up to $1k. Then the manipulation started. I held on at first, but then even IB restricted purchasing (options). Even though my heart told me to hold, I knew rationally the momentum had been stopped. With a heavy heart, I sold around $330 and told my wife to do the same. Better to accept defeat in battle and to fight another day.Over the next few weeks, we saw the price crash. I bought at $150 in premarket a few days later, and again at $120, $100, $80, $60, $50. Before I knew it, I was (almost) all in again. The price was wrong, and naturally, it shot back up over $300. I had peaked around $2.5M before dipping back down to under $1.5M. At the $340 peak, I saw my account surpass $5M, and felt that was ""good enough"". I sent the screenshot to my wife, and followed the very wise adage of ""Good enough to screenshot, good enough to sell"" and cashed out 1/3 of my holdings. I was lucky because within 5 minutes, it started crashing hard, to below $200. What a deal, I jumped back in the next day.

&#x200B;

**Performance Summary:** I've stopped going all-in with FDs after learning from the brave souls who have gone before me here on WSB (and from my own previous bankruptcies). Instead, I've been selling calls to reduce my risk, while providing a solid income that I can use to buy more shares (and sometimes more FDs, because who can resist tendies?). I cashed out on June 19th to buy a house at $7.2M + $300k previously withdrawn, at peak wealth at around $7.5M, which is why the graph stops here. My wife's initial $5k investment went up to around $350k at its peak.The remaining is still in GME shares/options. I've been bleeding out, down over $1M (again) since then, but that doesn't matter. Shorts have to cover, and I'm already buckled in. I'm holding for my grandchildren and their grandchildren. To the moon. 🚀🌔

&#x200B;

**Bonus Graph:** We Canadian apes get a TFSA where profits don't get taxed. While I played various option strategies on my margin account, I mainly bought and held long term options and shares in this account. My double down of $19k in January went here, which eventually grew to $6.5M. Tax free. Come at me, CRA (jk, plz don't).",GMERocketToTheMoon,1779,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p0teyc/took_50k_to_15k_to_75m_gme_to_the_moon/h88w7f0/,0.086,0.784,0.13,0.9917

30,TFSA," FYI, you should definitely get a tax lawyer on retainer regarding the TFSA. When a TFSA account gets this big, it will probably trigger an audit but the CRA. A lawyer will know what to say to them. Do not try to talk to them on your own!",phreakytiki,34,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p0teyc/took_50k_to_15k_to_75m_gme_to_the_moon/h89dwh3/,0.0,0.917,0.083,0.442
31,GME," Speaking as someone who's relatively well off from some crazy gambles that paid off-(including GME where I actually made about the same as what you did on that first run)-I'm telling you that you should diversify out enough that you're not going to have thrown away a very nice retirement if one of your concentrated positions blows up. You're killing it right now but trust me when I say that you can lose the money just as rapidly as you made it if you continue playing options and concentrating everything in one bet. I've had periods where I was down 80% of my entire net worth because highly concentrated high risk investments that run up thousands of percent in a year can also run downwards just like that.

Take it from someone who's managed to have multi-million dollar swings multiple times in his life-you really don't want to feel like the asshole who threw away his family's retirement because he didn't take some serious profits. You don't have to sell it all, but if you're not setting aside 2-3 million right now you're a  moron. Will you be able to look your wife and/or kids in the eye and realize that you pissed an awesome life for them away because you couldn't stop gambling?

Diversify out enough that you and your wife will be fucking fine forever. That means $2 million on the low end and more like $3-4 million to be on the safer side, especially if the two of you don't have high paying careers where you could make that money back in a few years.

Plus there is also Paramount + which Paramount owns...

AMC is HEAVILY in debt in the Billions... Plus there is also the deferred rent that is still owned which is pegged at 400 million+

>Aron also noted that the company owes its landlords some $400 million in deferred rent stemming from last year’s shutdowns. “What if we go to some of those landlords and say, if you let us pay less, we will pay you now \[rather than later as agreed\].”

Crazy how people just keep throwing money daily at AMC thinking some sort of squeeze is coming.   Meanwhile this company owes mega in DEBT.   

Hopefully today after market close AMC can show these folks who think AMC is an amazing company --- what it really is.   A company in financial despair.   Check out the financials from when the golden age of the Billion Dollar box office was going to the m00n.   The stock was under $20 per share.   Now it's over $30 and the company is in worse shape financially than ever.

272,MVST," Just read this in a different forum about MVST

""So i started a free trial with Ortex to gain access to their short interest report. As described in thier words ""ORTEX short interest data is sourced from the worlds largest combined pool of agent lenders, prime brokers, and broker-dealers who submit their inventory"", so this may be our best short at getting an aggregate market-level view of the overall short interest on MVST.  
Look at the numbers highlighted in red. Total shares on loan is 9.32M, utilization of these 9.32M shares is 99.97%, and cost to borrow is 22.87%. This is many times more than what we all have been thinking. The fact that utilization of their borrowed shares is 99.97% means, there is literally only 2796 shares availble to short. If we keep up the momentum we may be in for a larger squeeze than initially thought.

We would like to think that someday when a movie is filmed about AMC and COVID, its title will be one compelling word, ‘Recovery.’ But, only time will tell.”",actuarythrowaway445,6,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p101wm/daily_popular_tickers_thread_for_august_09_2021/h8bvqug/,0.02,0.91,0.07,0.4497

Did a bit of my own DD, and I like what I'm seeing here. It got me thinking about the CRM market and the HubSpot vs. Salesforce dynamic, and I don't think DigitalOcean's position is dissimilar to that of HubSpot's. 

At face value, the CRM market is dominated by a few heavy hitters and is intimidating to enter, but even SFDC only has <25% market share, and HubSpot -- despite a significant disadvantage in resources and experience -- has been able to consistently out-execute SFDC in the SMB space over the past few years due -- in my opinion -- to 1) strong community / brand loyalty, 2) simplifying what has traditionally been a complex type of software, and 3) a significantly lower total cost of ownership than 'enterprise-grade' competitors. 

Also -- on an anecdotal level -- I work in the iPaaS space, which gives me a lot of exposure to enterprise software trends (which is why I'm very bullish on Snowflake, despite analysts claiming it is still overvalued), and there's a lot of folks at SMBs that are salty about AWS's complexity and unpredictable TCO. Certainly coming across a lot of Azure, but that's more so due to Microsoft's ability to sell the 'side of fries' with the Office/Dynamics, than it being a superior to AWS. 

From an addressable market standpoint, many companies -- regardless of industry/size -- are 'tech companies'... they just don't know it yet. They need to embrace technology in order to compete / differentiate / scale effectively, or they won't be in business ten years from now. I firmly believe we're only scraping the tip of the iceberg with SMBs today.

That's all to say, I think there's a massive opportunity here for DigitalOcean to carve-out a sizable niche in SMB.",Laxhobo2002,4,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p0s8nu/forget_faang_introducing_the_thicc_ass_portfolio/h8b3uox/,0.02,0.847,0.133,0.989

Basically, this is going to probably need more than a 10% increase to not crush your Sept calls, with the 20Aug ones needing an even bigger boost. Good luck OP, but this is a huge risk on those 20Aug call with them being that far OTM.

738,ELY," AFAIK there is no way to accurately calculate that, but for the most part it should be a forgone conclusion that IV will fall on an option that far OTM post ER

Just look at it this way, pretend you don’t own these as of now and tomorrow ELY blows out earnings and gains 10%. 

That would put the share price at $37 from where it is as of this comment. Meaning, in the following 8 trading days till expiration the stock would still need to gain another 8% just to be ITM, with [presumably] no further catalysts. Then you would need to factor in the premium price (whatever it is after ER releases) to get your actual break even price. 

Would you want to spend 0.84 per contract (using your 300% gain estimate) tomorrow/Weds betting that ELY will gain *minimally* another 10% in the next 8 days on top of the 10% it just gained and the 6% it gained the week leading into ER?

Along comes SoFi. Built on offering competitive student loans with benefits that no other bank has. Why? Because they built a platform around trust. Get a student loan and you get career services free and if you lose your job, they’ll pause your payments. What?? Because they are willing to sacrifice a few bucks to provide you services because they know that student loan is going to make you a banking customer.   

You’ve been banking with SoFi and you’ve utilized their career services, now you’re coming back for a mortgage refinance, and you are using their automated investing (#1 by Barrons). Oh, I forgot to mention that it will only get better as they complete the acquisition on their bank charter to offer even more competitive rates.  

Younger generations seem to want companies that they can trust, and that are benefiting society. Find me a bank that is educating you before they tell you to get that home mortgage or that personal loan...oh wait, they can’t because they need you to be irresponsible to make money.  

It’s simple, accept lower revenue while building trust and a platform, resulting in unmatched customer retention. This is tagged a YOLO, but another 4,500 shares are put away in the SoFi invest account and weekly buys are added because this is a company that will totally disrupt the banking industry and along the way will educate and make your money work for you.

817,AMD," I'm sure this isn't all of it so people please correct what is wrong or missing, this is just my understanding of buying calls. contract price = premium per share x 100 shares, premium = $ share has to rise for cost of contract to break even, value of contract = -$ profit until contract breaks even
Different $ premium, same contract #
Buy single contract at $2 premium(paid $200), buy another single contract for same date and call at $5 premium(paid $500). Stock goes up $1 a share. You're up $100 on each but still down overall.  -$200 + 100 = -100 on first, -$500+100= -$400 on second.
Price goes up $2 ur even/at 0 on first but -300 on second. 
Price goes up $5 ur +300 on first but just now even on second. 
Price up $10 ur +800 on first, +500 on second.

Different # contract, same premium $
Buy 2 contracts at $2 premium (2x200= paid 400) vs 5 contracts for $2 premium (5x 200= paid 1000). Stock goes up $1. Up $100 per contract. So -$400 + (100x2)= -200 or  -$1000 + (100x5) = -500.
Price goes up $2 you'd be even/at 0 on both.
Price goes up $5 
-$400 + (500x2) = 600 or -$1000 + (500x5) = +1500.
Price up $10
-$400+(1000x2)= +$1600 or -$1000 + (1000x5) = +$4000.

""The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is looking for proposals for IT Infrastructure Support Services on a contract that could run 7.5 years and total up to $487.5 million.

“The FDIC is looking for a vendor partner who will work with the FDIC and commit to guarantee the availability of technology and provide continuous improvements at reduced costs,” the proposal request states.

The winning vendor will manage support services for FDIC’s IT infrastructure including facilities, hardware, software and systems, and planned technology upgrades.

The initial task order will be $250 million over five years, including options. Two and a half years of performance incentives could be added with “exceptional” performance for an additional $125 million.

851,COIN," It is time to go up for COIN
1) Q2 results are expected to be insane given record “main coin” price in Q2 2021
2) “main coin” is on the rise currently , COIN usually correlates with “main coin”
3) The price is 20% below IPO price - so there is plenty room for a rise
4) EV/ revenue =8 if we take into account only existing shares ( and around 20 if we take the number of shares on fully diluted basis)
5) The company is the leader in the market and it’s revenue is rising by 100% per year

Strong buy!!
Support from degenerates is just what COIN needs!!!

""So i started a free trial with Ortex to gain access to their short interest report. As described in thier words ""ORTEX short interest data is sourced from the worlds largest combined pool of agent lenders, prime brokers, and broker-dealers who submit their inventory"", so this may be our best short at getting an aggregate market-level view of the overall short interest on MVST.  
Look at the numbers highlighted in red. Total shares on loan is 9.32M, utilization of these 9.32M shares is 99.97%, and cost to borrow is 22.87%. This is many times more than what we all have been thinking. The fact that utilization of their borrowed shares is 99.97% means, there is literally only 2796 shares availble to short. If we keep up the momentum we may be in for a larger squeeze than initially thought.

1031,BP," Gevo, Inc. (NASDAQ: GEVO), is extremely pleased to announce today that its wholly-owned dairy manure-based renewable natural gas (“RNG”) project company located in northwest Iowa, Gevo NW Iowa RNG, LLC (“NW Iowa RNG”), has signed binding, definitive agreements with BP Canada Energy Marketing Corp. and BP Products North America Inc. (collectively, “bp” ) for the sale of NW Iowa RNG’s production (the “bp Agreements”).  
  
The NW Iowa RNG project is currently being constructed and is expected to commence production in early 2022. Upon project completion, NW Iowa RNG is estimated to produce approximately 355,000 MMBtu of RNG per year. The RNG is expected to be sold into the California market under dispensing agreements bp has in place with Clean Energy Fuels Corp., the largest fueling infrastructure in the U.S. for RNG.  
  
RNG-fueled vehicles are estimated to result in up to 95 percent lower emissions than those fueled by gasoline or diesel on a lifecycle basis, according to a US Department of Energy study.  
  
It is anticipated that NW Iowa RNG will benefit from environmental product revenues under California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard program and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Renewable Identification Number program.  
  
Beginning in late 2022 upon stabilized operations and pathway certifications of its environmental products, NW Iowa RNG is expected to generate cash distributions to Gevo of approximately $9 to $16 million per year. Starting in 2024, Gevo will have the right to use a portion of NW Iowa RNG’s production as process energy at its Net-Zero 1 Project or other production facilities, including future Net-Zero projects.  
  
“RNG is proving to be a key fuel in the energy transition. bp has a value chain that allows RNG to reach the transportation market, and it’s a pleasure to work with a company that shares our vision of a low-carbon future,” said Dr. Patrick R. Gruber, Chief Executive Officer of Gevo. “This is an excellent opportunity to meet the growing demand for RNG and to expand our RNG business.

1120,CCS," Value is kind of my thing, so if i may make a recommendation. M/I homes is trading at 61, and was trading in the 60's sometime today. The book value of that company is 50, and it's tangible book and book are pretty similar. It's trading below what it's book value will be in 12 months, and imho it's not even close. CCS is also a good pick up in the home builder space.

GM is trading at a low multiple relative to future earnings.

LYB for chemicals (Though it got a cramer mention as cheap, but he's not wrong).

For Growth Value, i'd pick Alight as it's a Bill Foley chaired company that's poised to outperform its first quarter as a public company.

Other common risks with pharmaceutical companies include patent expiry. For Opdivo it's 2026 outside the US and 2028 in the US. For Eliquis it's about the same. 

At best BMY is a decent value play but unlikely to outperform SPY or QQQ.

1164,BMY," Last I looked Revlimid was like $20B/yr in sales (close to $750 per pill FFS) so a huge chunk of their revenue.  As I’ve seen others state, this drug and its sister Pomalyst will likely be obsolete.  It’s already being replaced by Darzalex for front line Multiple Myeloma treatment, although they are still used in conjunction.  That said I was on revlimid for years and it worked moderately well with no side effects, but darzalex worked way better for me.

At the start of the pandemic I actually bought puts on BMY in case Myeloma patients started dying en masse, thankfully that didn’t really happen.",derprondo,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p0n45b/bristol_myerssquibb_bmy_dd/h8a2k42/,0.029,0.854,0.117,0.864
