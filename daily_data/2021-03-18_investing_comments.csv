Here is a list of the Uranium tickers, plus a little .02 on each. I own some of each, though I am mostly invested in UUUU. Hope this is helpful.

Mines

CCJ - Cameco - One of the largest producers in the world.  In Canada, probably the least risky

DNN - Denison Mines - Canadian miner, relatively small but has been around since the last boom

NXE - NexGen Energy - World class deposit, potential to be a massive producer but still early days

UEC - Uranium Energy Corp - Risky but is doing well

URG - UR Energy - I own some but very risky. They are hoping for US gov. stimulus to avoid equity dilution raises.  Potential upside is their new production process which should give them the lowest cost production in the US.

Processing/Mines

UUUU - Energy Fuels - I like this one a lot.  They are based in the US and will benefit for the US gov. spending.  They also own a processing mill which is one of the only facilities available for uranium in the US.  Recently they have pivoted into rare earths and are getting a lot of press for this, just striking a major deal.

Processing

LEU - Centrus Energy - Enrichment facility, one of the only ones I could find thats public, lot of variability in the stock price but I'm up over 100%

ETF

URA - Global Uranium ETF - Lot of the above tickers in this.  Key thing is that they also have holdings in the Kazakistan company which is the largest and lowest cost producer in the world.  Other thing to note is that some of the companies included often are only secondary producers of uranium (ie they mine gold but also find uranium).

No. If you stopped there, the company would just keep growing a pile of unused cash. It would only get $7 year after year and not be able to compound it.

Nope. Profits only produce growth when they are invested in *new* productive assets.  

>I'm saying that linking market cap growth to GDP growth is inaccurate[*] because the growth that you should be looking to link to GDP growth is growth of value (profits).

Correct; but profits do not generate growth in future profits unless they are used for that purpose. Dividends and buybacks are not used for that inside the company. The shareholders may take that money and use it to invest in new productive assets (emphasis on new because buying existing assets from someone else does not create new growth). This would eventually grow the aggregate public market cap if that's done in a private company that eventually goes public. Or they may spend it on consumption.

>  
Anyone buying this stock should not be buying it for the OFS business. In fact, when I think of TUSK, I don't even view it as an OFS company. Those businesses are part of legacy TUSK...old news, not growing, in decline, and certainly not the future of this company. This also might be why the stock isn't trading in lockstep with oil prices and energy shares as you typed your article. You're an oil and energy guy, so I can understand why you'd make this mistake and remain hung up on this side of their business, while also breezing over and giving very little credit to the other side (Infrastructure/Civil Engineering). Mammoth Energy Services, or TUSK, is an Infrastructure Services company masquerading as an OFS business, and its actually still quite cheap here even with all of the ""hair"" that you outline, with some upside optionality to boot. It's not in disarray, its misunderstood and transforming into something new and improved (and outside your area of focus)...and frankly the proof is in the pudding.  
It is common knowledge that their OFS business is and has been languishing. This should not be news to anyone. So for argument's sake, why don't we just go ahead and value their OFS business at zero for now, and keep it tucked in our back pocket as a free call option on that business coming back to life even marginally, or perhaps a sale of these assets at some point in the future (note: management actually did say on the recent Q4 call that they expect Pressure Pumping to be EBITDA positive in 2021, and are receiving increased bidding opportunities, while Sand pricing is increasing and Sand production is returning to full capacity, ). But for argument's sake, let's slap a goose egg on OFS.  
And yes, they indeed have been (for years now...) in a legal mess related to PREPA. Also widely known and should not be news to anyone who is even remotely paying attention. You don't need to read their 2020 10-K to figure that out...just look at the 4 year stock chart. The PREPA mess is the reason why the stock went from a high of around $40 in 2018 down to around $2 at the end of 2019 just before COVID. It's unlikely the PREPA legal debacle can get much worse from here. I'd say the stock not only priced in the downside, but has also moved on from fretting about this saga. So again, for argument's sake let's go ahead and value the recovery of their $227M outstanding account receivable from PREPA at zero for now, and tuck it away in our back pocket with the OFS biz as a free call option on a partial recovery of those funds.  
Indeed their 2nd largest shareholder and their largest OFS customers, Gulfport Energy (GPORQ), recently filed Ch. 11. Since we've already agreed to value the OFS biz at zero...and Gulfport is part of that business (and they took a $20M charge related to Gulfport in Q4), I suppose we don't have to worry much about the concentration risk and ""complicated relationship"" related to Gulfport as one of their top clients. Slap a goose egg on it. I don't care about this business.  
As for the shareholder class action lawsuits...any time a stock materially depreciates like TUSK's has, the news feed for said company is always littered with ambulance chasing lawyers announcing class action shareholder lawsuits trying to capitalize on the situation by claiming wrong doing by management. The fact that they have some of these lawsuits doesn't surprise me, and it doesn't do much for me.  
So why would anyone own the stock here? Answer: TUSK's Infrastructure Power business, Lion Power Services, which oversees four subsidiary companies: High Power Electrical, 5 Star Electric, Aqua Wolf, and Brim Aviation. This is where the future growth of the company exists, and they are already demonstrating it in their results, driven by the execution of a newly appointed management team.  
Lion Power Services is led by:

1. President Ed Will (formerly of Quanta Power Inc...subsidiary of Quanta Services, ticker: PWR...you may have heard of them?) 
2. VP of Business Development Shawn Mangan (formerly of Primoris, ticker: PRIM...you may have heard of them?) 
3. VP of Transmission Operations Tom Leech. 

>Since these three industry veterans joined TUSK to lead Lion Power in Q4'19 / Q1'20...the proof is in the numbers. After continuous declines, Revenue from this Infrastructure segment stabilized at a base of \~ $25M in Q4'19 and around the same \~ $25M for Q1'20, before growing to $30M in Q2, $44M in Q3 and $56M in Q4 (all during COVID mind you). As for EBITDA margins in this segment, they went from negative -36% in Q4'19 (when Ed Will first joined) and have recovered into the positive mid-teens (17% in Q3'20 and 13% in Q4'20) with management expecting this range to continue through 2021 (15% - 18% EBITDA margins for 2021). .   
This business is growing and their end markets, which are essential services (electricity transmission, keeping your lights and fridge on...stuff like that), have major secular tailwinds at their back:  
Aqua Wolf awarded the recent $40M engineering contract with a utility  
2) Aqua Wolf team has grown from 18 engineers up to 26 engineers  
3) our country has a dilapidated, aging and failing power grid that desperately needs repair, maintenance, and modernization  
4) Emergency work related to xtreme weather trends and natural disasters that continue to increase (last year's wildfires in CA and the associated rolling blackouts, this year's deep freeze in TX and the associated rolling blackouts, more intense hurricane seasons every year and the associated power outages, etc etc)  
5) the rollout of 5G telecom infrastructure and fiber nationwide  
6) a White House on the cusp of announcing plans for a major infrastructure stimulus packageAlso...just for kicks...riddle me this Doc:   
If the future and outlook for TUSK was so precarious, why would these three seasoned professionals who worked for very reputable, secure, stable, well established companies like Quanta (PWR) and Primoris (PRIM) leave there to jump aboard what you deem a sinking ship at the end of 2019 (a time when all of their legal woes were already widely publicized and clearly reflected in the stock price)? I surmise either these gents believe the outlook for TUSK/Lion Power is promising...or they believe they can make the outlook for TUSK promising. That would be my guess, given that's what they are doing.  
Whaddya know? These guys joined in Q4'19/Jan'20, they get ramped up in Q1'20...and what do you a see in their financials? A sharp U-turn in both Revenue growth and EBITDA margins in the Infrastructure segment.  
I guesstimate (at the low end) that on the currently young and very promising trajectory that this Infrastructure business alone could generate around \~ $[300](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/300-USD) of Revenue in 2021 and \~ $60M of EBITDA, with high probability potential upside to that number. That's \~ 5.4x EV/EBITDA, without any contribution from the OFS side of TUSK's business.   
At \~ 5x Infrastructure EBITDA...TUSK is an incredibly cheap stock here.

But for argument's sake, let's slap a goose egg on OFS.  
And yes, they indeed have been (for years now...) in a legal mess related to PREPA. Also widely known and should not be news to anyone who is even remotely paying attention. You don't need to read their 2020 10-K to figure that out...just look at the 4 year stock chart. The PREPA mess is the reason why the stock went from a high of around $40 in 2018 down to around $2 at the end of 2019 just before COVID. It's unlikely the PREPA legal debacle can get much worse from here. I'd say the stock not only priced in the downside, but has also moved on from fretting about this saga. So again, for argument's sake let's go ahead and value the recovery of their $227M outstanding account receivable from PREPA at zero for now, and tuck it away in our back pocket with the OFS biz as a free call option on a partial recovery of those funds.  
Indeed their 2nd largest shareholder and their largest OFS customers, Gulfport Energy (GPORQ), recently filed Ch. 11. Since we've already agreed to value the OFS biz at zero...and Gulfport is part of that business (and they took a $20M charge related to Gulfport in Q4), I suppose we don't have to worry much about the concentration risk and ""complicated relationship"" related to Gulfport as one of their top clients. Slap a goose egg on it. I don't care about this business.  
As for the shareholder class action lawsuits...any time a stock materially depreciates like TUSK's has, the news feed for said company is always littered with ambulance chasing lawyers announcing class action shareholder lawsuits trying to capitalize on the situation by claiming wrong doing by management. The fact that they have some of these lawsuits doesn't surprise me, and it doesn't do much for me.  
So why would anyone own the stock here? Answer: TUSK's Infrastructure Power business, Lion Power Services, which oversees four subsidiary companies: High Power Electrical, 5 Star Electric, Aqua Wolf, and Brim Aviation. This is where the future growth of the company exists, and they are already demonstrating it in their results, driven by the execution of a newly appointed management team.  
Lion Power Services is led by:

1. President Ed Will (formerly of Quanta Power Inc...subsidiary of Quanta Services, ticker: PWR...you may have heard of them?) 
2. VP of Business Development Shawn Mangan (formerly of Primoris, ticker: PRIM...you may have heard of them?) 
3. VP of Transmission Operations Tom Leech. 

>Since these three industry veterans joined TUSK to lead Lion Power in Q4'19 / Q1'20...the proof is in the numbers. After continuous declines, Revenue from this Infrastructure segment stabilized at a base of \~ $25M in Q4'19 and around the same \~ $25M for Q1'20, before growing to $30M in Q2, $44M in Q3 and $56M in Q4 (all during COVID mind you). As for EBITDA margins in this segment, they went from negative -36% in Q4'19 (when Ed Will first joined) and have recovered into the positive mid-teens (17% in Q3'20 and 13% in Q4'20) with management expecting this range to continue through 2021 (15% - 18% EBITDA margins for 2021). .   
This business is growing and their end markets, which are essential services (electricity transmission, keeping your lights and fridge on...stuff like that), have major secular tailwinds at their back:  
Aqua Wolf awarded the recent $40M engineering contract with a utility  
2) Aqua Wolf team has grown from 18 engineers up to 26 engineers  
3) our country has a dilapidated, aging and failing power grid that desperately needs repair, maintenance, and modernization  
4) Emergency work related to xtreme weather trends and natural disasters that continue to increase (last year's wildfires in CA and the associated rolling blackouts, this year's deep freeze in TX and the associated rolling blackouts, more intense hurricane seasons every year and the associated power outages, etc etc)  
5) the rollout of 5G telecom infrastructure and fiber nationwide  
6) a White House on the cusp of announcing plans for a major infrastructure stimulus packageAlso...just for kicks...riddle me this Doc:   
If the future and outlook for TUSK was so precarious, why would these three seasoned professionals who worked for very reputable, secure, stable, well established companies like Quanta (PWR) and Primoris (PRIM) leave there to jump aboard what you deem a sinking ship at the end of 2019 (a time when all of their legal woes were already widely publicized and clearly reflected in the stock price)? I surmise either these gents believe the outlook for TUSK/Lion Power is promising...or they believe they can make the outlook for TUSK promising. That would be my guess, given that's what they are doing.  
Whaddya know? These guys joined in Q4'19/Jan'20, they get ramped up in Q1'20...and what do you a see in their financials? A sharp U-turn in both Revenue growth and EBITDA margins in the Infrastructure segment.  
I guesstimate (at the low end) that on the currently young and very promising trajectory that this Infrastructure business alone could generate around \~ $[300](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/300-USD) of Revenue in 2021 and \~ $60M of EBITDA, with high probability potential upside to that number. That's \~ 5.4x EV/EBITDA, without any contribution from the OFS side of TUSK's business.   
At \~ 5x Infrastructure EBITDA...TUSK is an incredibly cheap stock here. And mind you, this is with no value ascribed to OFS potentially recovering, PREPA funds potentially being partially recovered, and no expansion into Renewable Energy projects.",doublea3,5,/r/investing/comments/m7c1ig/tusk_mammoth_energy_services_why_im_super_bullish/gract6k/,0.054,0.849,0.097,0.993

You want to short a stock that is trading at 5x EBITDA (perhaps even lower) in a high quality, high margin business that is growing...with potential upside from 1) a potential positive PREPA outcome in the cards sometime in the near future 2) potential for their OFS business to twitch back to life out of its coma (or the potential for them to sell these assets and pay down debt), and 3) the potential for multiple expansion afforded to companies that gain traction in the Renewable Energy/Clean Energy Tech/Energy Transition space?

TUSK is undergoing a business transition, away from legacy OFS with a clear, decisive and actionable focus towards Infrastructure Services in the future.

10 REASONS this article is a hack job: Many, if not most, of the reasons you cite for being bearish on the stock are either OLD news being regurgitated for the sake of sensationalism, conflict with statements you yourself make in the same article, lack clarity, are misleading, or make no sense at all (or all of the above):   
languishing and depressed OFS business = old news  
related to PREPA litigation...you note ""for which they are now in litigation"" --> the litigation has been going on for years now (also that much closer to a resolution) = old news  
related to their high customer concentrations… this has been noted in their 10-K Risk Factors for years; they’re actively working to diversify into new businesses with new customers = old news  
related to the high concentration of their top two shareholders (Wexford/Gulfport)…this has been the case since they IPO'd. Wexford and Gulfport took TUSK public = old news   
4a) Wexford has not sold a single share of their stake since around the highs in mid 2018. They are clearly in this for the long haul and still believe in the company. If I had to guess, they wouldn't even be tempted to sell until the stock reaches at a minimum the initial IPO price of $12.  
4b) might the Gulfport stake be sold off due to their Ch. 11 bankruptcy proceedings? Sure, perhaps. A transaction like this indeed might temporarily weigh on the price of the stock, but it would not impair the underlying fundamentals of the business. In addition, it could very well be received as a positive for the stock with the removal of an overhang",doublea3,4,/r/investing/comments/m7c1ig/tusk_mammoth_energy_services_why_im_super_bullish/gracvya/,0.044,0.859,0.097,0.9829

>For comparisons...lets take a gander at the current EV/EBITDA multiples afforded to other players in the Civil Engineering/Infrastructure Services space:  
PRIM = 6x '21 estimates  
MTZ = 9x '21 estimates  
AEGN = 9x '21 estimates (taken out at that multiple)  
DY = 10x '21 estimates  
PWR = 11x '21 estimates  
OEG = 13.5x '22 estimates (OEG isn't expected to be EBITDA positive until '22)  
Net Debt is down -30% since Q4'19 and Cash has been steadily increasing...now up +181% since it bottomed in Q4'19 (also when Infrastructure Services Revenue and EBITDA both bottomed, which also coincided with this new management team coming aboard to lead Lion Power Services).   
Now...take a stock that is trading at a meaningful discount to most of its Infrastructure peers, and layer on top of this three free call options that you get when buying the stock:  
their depressed OFS business coming back to life, even at the margin...after all, crude oil is trading back above prices immediately seen before COVID, even with many COVID travel restrictions still in place and the economy not full reopened yet.  
2) even a partial recovery of the funds owed to them from the PREPA bankruptcy.  
3) the high likelihood of their eventual entry into Renewable/Clean Tech projects (via Aqua Wolf)If either of the first two call options get exercised this year, well then the stock is even cheaper than 5x EBITDA right now...perhaps in the 2x to 3x range...with the prospect for meaningful multiple expansion if the third option goes in the money and they begin winning contract awards in the Renewable Energy/Clean Tech space (you know how much Reddit loves Renewable Energy!).  
You want to short a stock that is trading at 5x EBITDA (perhaps even lower) in a high quality, high margin business that is growing...with potential upside from 1) a potential positive PREPA outcome in the cards sometime in the near future 2) potential for their OFS business to twitch back to life out of its coma (or the potential for them to sell these assets and pay down debt), and 3) the potential for multiple expansion afforded to companies that gain traction in the Renewable Energy/Clean Energy Tech/Energy Transition space? Have fun with that.  
TUSK is undergoing a business transition, away from legacy OFS with a clear, decisive and actionable focus towards Infrastructure Services in the future. Usually business transitions take some time, but it’s very clear this transition that is underway is not only working and gaining traction, but also gaining steam…and at a very opportune time for civil infrastructure projects.  
So that's my view.

the Risk Factors you rattle off from the recent 2020 10-K, particularly related to PREPA, are verbatim the same Risk Factors disclosed in the 2019 10-K. If there was something incrementally new since the 2019 10-K hit, I'd give you credit, but that's not the case = old news  
Risk Factors disclosed in 10-Ks are meant to outline ALL of the potential risk that could harm the business or stock price. There are inherent risks in investing. If every risk factor in every 10-K in every company was taken at face value with a high probability of materializing, nobody would invest in companies! When I look through 10-Ks, I look for changes in Risk Factors compared to the previous version…new incremental risks, or adjustments to the language, are what can be noteworthy. The ones you cite have been listed for some time now. = old news  
""It's noteworthy that at a time when energy shares, generally speaking, are surging with the rise in oil prices, shares of TUSK are down. In fact during the few hours I've been writing this article the companies stock is down 8%, and appears headed for further decline today when the market opens."" --> perhaps this is because a) many investors increasingly don't view TUSK as an OFS/Energy play b) you are cherry picking the performance within a very small timeframe of mere hours that fall within a single day...this is the data point you use to reference a trend? c) the stock is up +154% since the end of December (following their 3rd validation by FEMA of their work performed for PREPA, following their $40M Aqua Wolf engineering contract, and following their Q4 results which demonstrated continued progress in their Infrastructure business and potential signs of life on the OFS side). = misleading  
On one hand you note: ""the EPIC business also is going to do well. The government, once it settles the current COVID relief package, will very likely begin deliberating a huge multi-trillion dollar infrastructure package that could very well benefit companies like TUSK...I could try and describe their prowess at securing this sort of work, but I would never do as well as some old older articles by a former contributor who helped to put this company on the map... Mr. Bert, a now deceased, retired Wall Street trader who devoted a good bit of his early writing to TUSK.

Mr. Bert was one of a kind""...and then later you write: ""The future of the company is undoubtedly in the EPIC/Infrastructure business for which they have shown an ability to secure work, and is growing and will continue to grow for the foreseeable future.""...  
which is then dubiously followed by this statement: ""It's also difficult to say if TUSK will be broadly successful in securing infrastructure work in this country. Most of their historical revenue of this type has been from PREPA and associated with their original contract and extensions. As such I'm not going to infer any revenue gain to justify an incremental value above an arbitrary $1.00 per share.

I'm almost wondering if you proofread your article before posting it...did you forget that earlier in the article you cited their Infrastructure business generated $155M of Revenue in 2020, (which posted 15% EBITDA margins for the 2H of 2020)? = sensationalism + conflicting with your own statements + lacking clarity + misleading + makes no sense at all  
10) Last but not least: you don't provide any estimates, math, inputs...or anything close to a reasonable basis for how you arrive at your $1.00 target.

128,TUSK," Part III:

>  
the Risk Factors you rattle off from the recent 2020 10-K, particularly related to PREPA, are verbatim the same Risk Factors disclosed in the 2019 10-K. If there was something incrementally new since the 2019 10-K hit, I'd give you credit, but that's not the case = old news  
Risk Factors disclosed in 10-Ks are meant to outline ALL of the potential risk that could harm the business or stock price. There are inherent risks in investing. If every risk factor in every 10-K in every company was taken at face value with a high probability of materializing, nobody would invest in companies! When I look through 10-Ks, I look for changes in Risk Factors compared to the previous version…new incremental risks, or adjustments to the language, are what can be noteworthy. The ones you cite have been listed for some time now. = old news  
""It's noteworthy that at a time when energy shares, generally speaking, are surging with the rise in oil prices, shares of TUSK are down. In fact during the few hours I've been writing this article the companies stock is down 8%, and appears headed for further decline today when the market opens."" --> perhaps this is because a) many investors increasingly don't view TUSK as an OFS/Energy play b) you are cherry picking the performance within a very small timeframe of mere hours that fall within a single day...this is the data point you use to reference a trend? c) the stock is up +154% since the end of December (following their 3rd validation by FEMA of their work performed for PREPA, following their $40M Aqua Wolf engineering contract, and following their Q4 results which demonstrated continued progress in their Infrastructure business and potential signs of life on the OFS side). = misleading  
On one hand you note: ""the EPIC business also is going to do well. The government, once it settles the current COVID relief package, will very likely begin deliberating a huge multi-trillion dollar infrastructure package that could very well benefit companies like TUSK...I could try and describe their prowess at securing this sort of work, but I would never do as well as some old older articles by a former contributor who helped to put this company on the map...

129,TSLA," Seeing a lot of consternation over the benchmark yield today, some of which is *totally* reasonable, some of which is just whining over ridiculous portfolio allocation and failing to own your investing decisions. Look, I get it - seeing the highest upside stocks get hammered over a 10-year deferred, sub 2% nominal return is less-than-ideal. Eventually, it spills over into broader indices and hurts all of us.

That said, you control your portfolio, and there's no rule that says rising yields = down 15% in one day. Those boring value stocks that so many deride have been doing pretty well this year, and will likely continue to do so. Insurance, commercial banking, blue-chip retail...Companies that turn profits and have a balance sheet that is rooted in reality. They won't give you a 600% return in a quarter, but if that's what you're chasing, you need to understand the risk which accompanies such a strategy.

Audit your portfolio beta; if your idea of a super safe value investment is TSLA and 50% of your allocation are 'reddit' positions, you're just gambling. That's A-OK and your upside potential is higher as a result, but no, stocks do not ""always go up"" and you can't be indignant when markets get spooked about companies that are all sizzle, no steak, trading at/near ATHs.

 They forget to comment on the costs of getting out of the market at such speed in exchange for a 0.01 increase in yields...Most blue chips will get you more in dividend form and MIGHT give you capital gains when you sell. 10 year bonds give you, what, 1.7%?  


I do not understand their math, but today, I bled. And I bled HARD.  


Also, to MM, everything is bad: inflation happening. Inflation suspected to be happening, but denied by the FED. Oil going up? production costs go up, industrials go red, bad. Oil going down? energy companies go red, bad. I swear my cat looks at me funny and SPY loses 10 points!  


Also, one piece of advice: never invest in anger. I bought RIDE after the Shorting by Hinderburg, thinking it would have been already discounted if the allegation were true. I was right, I made 10% in one day. I didn't sell at the end of the day...and...

Bond yields went up, sending all techs to hell and back  
Volkswagen killed it...sending all EVs to hell and back

And then my biggest mistake. Pissed with the losses on RIDE, I went straight to a gamble trade to recoup losses, that went as well as you could imagine. For all of you curious out there, I saw a move in OCG, my app failed to get me in at 12.16, saw it go straight to 16 in 7 minutes...and somehow bought in on the way down. At 13.26.

139,AMC," GME hyped me up, I started actively trading my rollover IRA, and though I've lost a small amount over the last two months, I can't play this game anymore.

A year ago I started a new job and had my previous job's 401k to rollover. I started learning about retirement accounts and options for long term investing, but that was about it. I left my account alone.

Flash forward to January 2021. GME happens. I get amped up. I started a brokerage account, deposited some from my bank account and took out from IRA to try to score big. Ended up losing a small amount when I held and sold the moment GME and AMC started spiking again a week or so ago.

Since then though, I started actively trading a small portion of my IRA. PLTR, SNDL, RYCEY, ZOM, TLRY, APHA, GO, APPH, APHA. Again, I only lost a small portion so far. Now when AMC started moving, I got amped up again this past week and , yet again, lost a small amount. 

I understand the risk, I understand I COULD have made decent gains but I timed it wrong and that's part of the game. But I hate how it's been making me feel. I know there are others who have lost MAJOR sums of money, but if this is how the small amount I've lost makes me feel, I can see why this ""game"" is not for everyone.

May contribute in small amounts and buy whatever would bring my cost basis down the most at that time.

I'm sure there's others around here similar to me, are new at this and may have had an emotional rollercoaster like myself these past two months.

144,PLTR," GME hyped me up, I started actively trading my rollover IRA, and though I've lost a small amount over the last two months, I can't play this game anymore.

A year ago I started a new job and had my previous job's 401k to rollover. I started learning about retirement accounts and options for long term investing, but that was about it. I left my account alone.

Flash forward to January 2021. GME happens. I get amped up. I started a brokerage account, deposited some from my bank account and took out from IRA to try to score big. Ended up losing a small amount when I held and sold the moment GME and AMC started spiking again a week or so ago.

Since then though, I started actively trading a small portion of my IRA. PLTR, SNDL, RYCEY, ZOM, TLRY, APHA, GO, APPH, APHA. Again, I only lost a small portion so far. Now when AMC started moving, I got amped up again this past week and , yet again, lost a small amount. 

I understand the risk, I understand I COULD have made decent gains but I timed it wrong and that's part of the game. But I hate how it's been making me feel. I know there are others who have lost MAJOR sums of money, but if this is how the small amount I've lost makes me feel, I can see why this ""game"" is not for everyone.

I've decided to keep the small portion of my IRA out of the original fund and make some long term investments. I've picked several to stick with for up to the end of this year (APPH, APHA, BETZ, GO, QCLN, RYCEY, THCX and TLRY) and I'll passively manage it along the way.

I think the market may be overestimating just how much ""traditional"" businesses will return to normal, and underestimating just how damaged they are from disrupters stealing market share, failure to change business models with the times, and added debt (which isn't considered a problem now, but those same rising interest rates that are causing investors to shy away from stocks valued on future earnings will ultimately do much worse damage to companies that aren't growing and carry a great deal of debt on the balance sheet).

Obviously doesn't apply to all traditional ""value"" companies, but to many. Oil for example, isn't dead yet and companies in that sector were certainly priced for death in April 2020 and undervalued in November. I could see good profits there in the next 5 years, and the loss of most of its market cap in the next 20. Anything brick and mortar is becoming much less desirable because that simply isn't how Millennials and younger tend to shop. Given the uncertainty that is occurring right now in the economy as a whole, I would prefer to invest in companies that exhibit solid growth in sectors that are the future then companies that are seen as necessary evils with outmoded or dying business models. Industries like insurance, health care, telephone companies (just compare U.S. cell phone service prices and quality with practically anywhere else on the planet) are ripe for disruption.

That being said, one does need to be reasonable about this. TSLA having more market cap then every other major auto producer makes no sense, as it fails to take into account the size of the potential market they are filling and the margins of the business they are in. That is an extreme case however.",Joeyjoejoejabadu,6,/r/investing/comments/m7mra8/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/grdm8zg/,0.158,0.704,0.138,-0.8686

Anyway, it appears I made a big mistake when I bought 10 shares of Corsair (CRSR) at $44. It’s gone down to $32. Now, this was meant to be a long-term investment, but I’m wondering if it’ll stick around the $30 range permanently, or if these kind of dips are normal and will likely go back to normal. I guess my question is, do I stick it out with CRSR as a long term investment like I planned, or do I cut my losses?

262,ABC," Yes you will get the face value of the bond (assuming no default)

Now this may or may not be the original ""cost"" as sometimes bonds are sold at a premium or discount

Lets say company ABC is doing a bond offering 10 years at 5% and they have a face value of $1000

Now that 5% interest rate is a good premium above the ""risk free rate"" the government offers what is approx 1.7%. Now if investors are bullish because they see little risk in default  and these bonds are limited these bonds may sell at more than the $1000 face value . Investors may pay $1020 for these because they like the 5% interest rate(this effectively lowers the interest rate to the market rate)

Or if they think the company is shaky and higher risk for a default it may sell at a discount, no one will bit until the price drops to like $950 (again this raises the interest rate to match the market rate).

However assuming no default in 10 years you will get the $1000 regardless if it sold at a premium or discount",SirGlass,3,/r/investing/comments/m7mqm4/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/grct5c3/,0.1,0.732,0.168,0.9548
263,OR," On that time scale, the less bonds the better. But there's one important thing to thing about: One year ago in March, VOO dropped over 30%.

If you go all-in on VOO and someday again it drops that much, that fast would you lose sleep? Would you feel sick to your stomach? OR do you think you could handle your emotions just fine?

If you think you can stomach a drop like that without making bad decisions (like panic selling everything at the bottom), then yes go 100% VOO.",goodDayM,1,/r/investing/comments/m7mqm4/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/grekwde/,0.109,0.748,0.142,0.3456
264,TD," Thank you :)

So I did ask someone that has a family but shares the same residency status and they agreed on the not going for the retirement accounts for now but choosing them only if residency status changes because currently I am not even qualifying for SS, stimulus and other benefits.

Let's say I start investing in the 403(b) that my employer offers and accumulate about 10k with matching and then decide to move to Canada. If I want to carry forward the account, I'd have to have the Roth IRA and 401k setup with Fidelity/TD Ameritrade and transfer out the 403 from TIAA (upon changing the country) to them as those are the only 2 brokerages that allow international addresses or non-use resident accounts.

Secondly, moving the money to RRSP or other options would entail paying a fee that would negate the gains by 10%. Historically (past 10 years), the returns have been about 10-11% from the market so if I end up paying about 10% in fees and then would have around 15-20% withheld, it paints apicture of a not the best investment vehicle.
While I agree that it is a poor choice, it is also not a good option in this situation where the final place of settlement is unclear.",theindianderp,1,/r/investing/comments/m7mqm4/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/grdfn2p/,0.063,0.836,0.101,0.664

i probably wouldn't. the money i've had in these accounts have been sitting in them for 1.5 years. i can't even withdraw this money anyway (without paying fees) since they're in retirement accounts. i'd be force to continue holding them at whatever price i bought em at. i don't think i would lose all value, and most likely with enough time i should have some gains from VOO. so for those reasons i feel comfortable about it",still_alive11,1,/r/investing/comments/m7mqm4/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/grelcuh/,0.073,0.839,0.088,0.1877
266,GDP," Having a look into Sumitomo, Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Yamato, Itochu and Marubeni, numbers are solid and valuation is far from being expensive. Japan might have a chance to get out of the deflationary environment as they might have recovered from their bubble in 1990s.

267,USA," USA has had explosive growth companies, Japan has not had much innovation since the 90s. Since the bubble in the 80s Japan has been very conservative corporate wise. The drive shareholder value with safe dividends and are adverse to risk and growing. Not many startups are new ideas are coming out of Japan anymore. The economy is centered around a select number blue chip corporations everyone strives to work for. That is why the Nikkei really stays so stagnant. If you are a Value investor sure you can make money in Japan, if you are a growth investor Nikkei has not been the place to be. America on the other hand has so many high growth companies in SP500 its capital gains just keep going up. America also keeps pushing innovations in many industries. In Japan people are much more comfortable protecting the way society is now and preventing another downside like the 80s than taking risks.   


It highlights one issue with index and passive investing is that you have a large exposure to economic and policy risk.

268,TR," sure but OP was saying Nikkei returning nothing (wrong) for a period 30 years ago, and thus you shouldn't invest in index funds today.

269,GE," again, if its not \*total return\* then you are reading it incorrectly.  i just looked at the nikkei total return, which started in 2002.  you do get that a stock price can not move but pay dividends still yielding a return.

also saying ""well the period from the late 80s to the early 90s is the reason not to buy something in 30 years later"" is, as i said, stupid.  case in point. did you know that GE from 1974 to 1980 annualized 14.59% a year!
