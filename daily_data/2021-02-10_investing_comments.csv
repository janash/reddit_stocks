0,AMZN," The short story:

It's a long awaited update to the SIP feed that has been discussed for almost 2 years now. The new rules expand the content of NMS market data to include:

1. information about orders in share amounts smaller than the current round lot size (e.g., 100 shares);

2.  information about certain orders that are outside of an exchange’s best bid and best offer (i.e., certain depth of book data); and

3. information about orders that are participating in opening, closing, and other auctions.

Also:
Competing consolidators, rather than the existing exclusive SIPs, will collect, consolidate, and disseminate certain NMS information.

It was adopted in December. They should be effective in 60 days, but a phased transition plan begins in 2021 to avoid chaos.

11,AOS," I think the average retail investor would come off worse by paying broker fees. Say you buy 50 shares of $100/share  ($5k). If you paid $5 trading cost to execute, you'd need $0.10/share better execution price to breakeven compared to a HFT scalping free commission world. If you watch some company like apple, the bid/ask is often like $0.01-$0.05. Even on a stock like AOS ($10B mkt cap), it's like $0.01-$0.05 spread. HFT is typically scalping fractions of a penny on a buy/sell. In fact, I'm pretty confident you getting a better execution price when you route a market buy/sell order through HFT funds, as there's now a bigger pool of people to trade with. There's a reason bid/ask spreads have gone way down over the years, and HFT is a big part of it.

17,GME," Okay, hold up. People weren't stupid. The GME short squeeze thesis was on point. No one expected:

1. Robinhood to be so undercapitalized and
2. The NSCC to demand $3 billion in collateral, negotiated down to $0.7 billion by Robinhood and
3. Robinhood and other brokers restricting buys but allowing sells to net out the order book to compensate for negotiated reduced collateral requirements, destroying the price momentum, margin calling everyone out (Robinhood default account is margin enabled, but most of their unsophisticated users don't understand this and what it means), resulting in rapidly falling prices of the security (if you only allow sells of a security, what would you think is going to happen to the price and the order book?).

Were people exuberant and not as educated as they should've been for participating in capital markets? Absolutely. But tell me why the clearinghouse's risk model didn't account for the risk Melvin and other shorts in the GME position were taking on until the trade was going to go sideways. Because they didn't expect anyone to discover the over-leveraging and move rapidly against such a short position? That sounds like a risk management and model failure. The game changed mid play (and it's clear it was done to prevent insolvency of the clearing fund).

The regulatory failure was that we arrived at a point where brokers had to restrict trades. Shorts should've never been permitted to take such leveraged short positions where market participation constraints needed to be enacted on short notice to prevent market failures. But they were, and the market makers and market infrastructure should've been forced to let it play out to it's conclusion.",toomuchtodotoday,10,/r/investing/comments/lgu4bx/nasdaq_nyse_sue_sec_over_planned_overhaul_of/gmv11gr/,0.133,0.768,0.1,-0.9118

21,IR," They aren’t prices, they’re bids. 

It’d make companies much more apprehensive when making bids, it’d also give more information away about their long-terms plans than they’d like to give (ie: if they want to extend into a certain industry, couldn’t make one acquisition but they’d likely try to buy another in the future). You’d then get all sorts of speculators hedging other stocks and hugely increasing volatility. It’d put an undue strain on their IR staff, and it’s just not something they should have to disclose. They don’t even have to disclose financials of a deal as it stands now. 

I guess tldr: Its a bunch of information that doesn’t add value to investors but increases speculation and makes extra work for companies.

66,AI," Okmanl,

I'm curious where MF refers to interviewing employees at the firms they recommend, was that an article or the podcast everyone is talking about on this thread? That sounds like impressive and surprising DD, which I haven't seen at MF, at least in the few months ive been in Stock Advisor.

I have found the monthly recommendations to be fairly short write ups, but I very well may be missing something. I've watched as $LMND has gone up massively since their recommendation, but I'm not sure I understand why, and my opinion of MF is riding on their recommendation of $LMND recommendation and a few other companies. $LMND uses lots of buzz words, but I'm unclear about how their AI/ML is being used to drive such unique capabilities. The questions they ask for a quote appear pretty standard, so I'm guessing the AI/ML differentiator must be in the back end or interfacing with customer claims rather than in quoting.

I get that $LMND can have lower costs if they have lower acquisition costs than their competitors,  but the idea of somehow offloading risk to a reinsurance company confuses me. Perhaps they can make a profit on well priced policies up front, but over time the reinsurance company will require higher costs to cover the risk.

The $LMND reviews on the App store have many happy customers, but it seems that everyone happy with their quote or policy, until they have a claim and then are frustrated by technical issues without a phone number to call to resolve. From what I understand the prices have gone up over the last few years, and in a number of reviews, people said ""LMND isn't as cheap as it used to be when I got it"".

My concern about giving away excess profits is that PC claims aren't consistent on an annual basis, they come in waves with natural disasters. Profits from the good years are needed for the eventual bad year when huge claims hit, so has $LMND just not had to cover a natural disaster year yet?

The stock market obviously loves $LMND, and certainly the narrative of disrupting a stodgy industry like insurance is great. As someone who was in $LMND ahead of MF, can you help me understand what led you to invest in the company? I'm really interested in knowing bc I'm concerned I'm missing something important, but most articles I've read don't really do a deep dive in DD. Is there a competitive advantage that $LMND has that can't be replicated by larger competitors? Or is this just market hype around a small growth firm with a buzzwords business model?

The thesis is that this is a textbook case of innovator's dilemma being played out.

Lemonade at first entered a very underserved market (renter's insurance) to build brand value and recognition. They're now releasing new insurance products every 6-8 months.

The incumbents have the luxury of a huge customer set but high expectations of yearly sales. They are still relying on a lot of legacy systems and core capabilities (broker based systems, software that's still running on COBOL). Many shareholders still expect yearly dividends. And so on.

All of this makes it more difficult to just reinvent themselves overnight.

Meanwhile lemonade was built from the ground up to be a digital insurance company.
 

This is the same thing you see played out with Amazon vs incumbent retailers (Walmart, Target, Barnes & Nobles). Tesla vs auto-companies. Netflix vs Blockbuster.

The incumbents knew how big of a deal the internet is, or AV/EV. But because of inherent structural differences between them and the more innovative companies, it's harder for them to catch up.

But decades later just 3 automobiles controlled well over 90% of the auto market in the US, and most of those 100+ auto makers had gone out of business, or in some cases been acquired by one of the big 3.

149,SQ," (1.) Agree and (2.) disagree.   
1. A lot of their growth with businesses is from getting small businesses hooked into more and more services, and if there is the small business Armageddon everyone has been predicting since Covid day 1, they lose a lot and have to build back with new replacements from scratch.   
1b. The valuation is insane, but it's still lower than shopify who is innovating less and more easy for new competitors to come in.   
2. There is a ton innovative in SQ and very little of their revenue growth has been in POS over the last 2 years. You fundamentally misunderstand their business. Cash app, crypto trading, small business banking services all make up more than the little swipe cube. Cash App really is significantly different from Venmo or any of the competitors the traditional banks are jumping onto (Zelle is a joke), it's taking on people young enough to have never had a credit card as well as the check cashing payday loan sort of businesses that a huge swath of the population depend on (immigrant populations especially).

164,RH," First off, robinhood is a goddamn joke of a brokerage, designed to look more like a video game than a brokerage. Their level of thoroughness explaining margin accounts and limits to their customers is appalling, almost as appalling as how freely they give away privilege to trade options. 

Initially I thought the flight of user from robinhood to square was only for use as a crypto wallet. But it's not.

Secondly, apparently square is a broker now too. I wouldn't buy/sell stocks there. What could go wrong? I have to admit, I was surprised by this revelation too.

Thirdly, and I think this is the most important point. Robinhood users would rather have a brokerage that is easy to look at from their phone, and feels like it's a simplified game, than bother with a real professional brokerage. Apparently RH users either haven't learned their lesson, or the boomers were actually right about video games rotting your brain.

170,PH," I absolutely have. For a year's worth of indoor you need a blue/green spectrum and a more red spectrum bulb, they aren't cheap. You need about 1000 watts for a good lumen per ft to get great trichrome production. If you plant in dirt you can just put some fertilizer in the soil with the plants or if you really want good stuff, get neutral soil and add liquid fertilizer with your water. Water has to be PH tested and reverse osmosis. If you want to do hydroponic you need a basin, a mixing tub, tubing, clay ball or other media and net pots and a pump. That water is going to need a ppm meter and PH tested. You also need black/white liner for most of the room to maximize lumen reflection, keep spills out of the floor boards and to prevent light leaks. Seeds need to be germinated, clones need their own area and light source with a special media. You'll need to get chrysanthemum pesticide incase spider mites become an issue. Timers for the lights, need to check leaves daily and possibly pin branches/set up a screen of green setup to keep the plant from touching the bulb. You need air conditioning, preferably a light mounted exhaust tube to the outside with a good fan with the proper cfm for your area. That comes to about 2k for your first harvest, not counting hydro for 1000 watts 16-8 hours a day (400-600 if you are cheap and don't care about quality) and the air conditioning since you get a lot of waste heat.

174,VERY," Great points, especially useful to have Med vs Rec as a comparison to see where prices could go. 

To clarify my thought, I also don’t think that people growing their own weed will hamper the market very much. But the ease at which a homeowner can produce such mass quantities shows me that the margin of retail (or medical) products have no where to go but down. There’s no competitive advantages to hold on to and help differentiate producers. Growing weed is very easy. VERY easy.

175,THC," How I started also ^ sorry for being a jerk in my last reply. That was dumb and I’m embarrassed. 

But then I realized the ease of avoiding all that with organically sustained outdoor soil, rain or well water, minimal nutrients and a big ass light called the sun. You can absolutely achieve high quality product outdoors with the right seeds/clones. You might suffer on something like output per linear foot of plant height (density of flower maybe?) but you can grow a 10 foot monster outdoors with very little work. I learned this first hand. 

If my THC levels come out to be ~20% on a strain that can achieve levels of ~22% then that’s definitely a negative effect of outdoor growing. But again my point is that output is so insanely high per plant! Canada had hundreds of tones of extra weed within the past 2 years. 

The stuff grows like weed and investing in such an absolute simple commodity that can be grown ANYWHERE (even indoors as you pointed out) doesn’t seem like a technology a company can defend very well. There isn’t a plant in my garden that grows as easily as marijuana, I just can’t picture much of a price tag on something so simple in the long term.",_venturezone_,0,/r/investing/comments/lgme6f/out_of_all_the_bubbles_that_are_forming_right_now/gmtue64/,0.085,0.794,0.121,0.8805

No talk about data ownership. In their website pitch to customers Artificial Intelligence is not mentioned. Suggests that AI is more a sales pitch to investors. Be wary of INDUSTRY + AI = Buy our IPO. Especially since Ag is an industry that people generally underestimate the technological sophistication of.

214,CCL," I’m mixed.  

I have some dividend (REIT mostly), and growth stocks.  There was the corona sale of course, and I’m holding my CCL, RCL and such for at least a year... no rush, let the cruises start again and when they spike I’ll see what’s up.  I have a chunk in VOO

I’ve started to invest in more than stocks.  The wife and I picked up two managed service condos in a 30ish story hotel/ casino/ vacation tourist apartment place. I picked up two small teak groves in Panama last month for my two one-year-old boys that cost like $14,500 but in 25 years should deliver them $1,450,000.  A pretty good kickstart out of college and getting into life.

219,NAV," Maybe at 53 I'm just too close to Boomer age, but does anyone else prefer mutual funds to ETFs?  I had a bad initial experience (probably 15-20 years ago) with ETFs because I bought one that was thinly traded and, as a result, it traded significantly below it's NAV.  Coming from a mutual fund world, that pissed me off and made no sense to me.  But since ETFs are traded like stocks, and the price is determined based upon supply and demand, it does make sense.  Don't have that issue with mutual funds.

But as to the OP's overall point, I think a lot of us get to that point eventually.  Either because the ETFs/Funds seem to perform better, or (like me) just because they are so much less work and effort.  I moved everything (sans a few individual stocks I still dabble in) to mutual funds probably 12 years ago.

My research now consists of tracking them to make sure nothing goes haywire, but only doing true research about every 3-5 years when I rebalance my portfolio.  That sure beats spending hours every week running stock screens, reading press releases and combing over SEC filings.

And it seems to have served me well.  My 5-, 3- and 1-year trailing annual returns right now are 17.38%, 15.06% and 30.12%.  That beats the S&P 500 Index, and that's really all I'm trying to do.

240,APHA," What to do with long term stocks that hit your price expectations in a matter of weeks/months.

So around September I started investing. Although I was playing with options since a few months before the March crash( but I don’t consider that investing). I read all the commonly read books, intelligent investor, random walk down wallstreet, one up on wallstreet, etc. I seriously believed in the fundamental value based investing strategy that if you just buy and hold long term no matter what you’ll come out on top. But here I am on top a lot sooner than expected and I don’t know what to do, I’m not prepared for this. I’m only 19 and kept thinking that the stocks I buy will be great in 20-30 years. I started with NIO( I know meme stock haha) but I bought them at 4$ with the logic that China is a huge market with plans by 2025 to have 25% EV usage. I thought 5-10 years it could hit 50$. 
     I also invested in APHA at 3$ thinking if they continue consolidating and continue as a well managed company they could possibly hit 10-15 in a few years. I also invested heavily into clean energy thinking the same. I know these sounds like humble brags but I’ve seriously come to a problem. I’ve made ridiculous amounts of money for me and my family at this age but it’s all unrealized gains. I thought I’d maybe be above market average if I’m lucky and be well off by the time of 30. 
       I have it drilled into my brain to not sell but when the average p/e of my portfolio goes from 25 to 200 in the matter of 4 months I don’t know what to do. If I sell I’m taking a heavy short term capital gains hit. I still believe in these companies long term but there so ahead of what there valuations should be I genuinely don’t know what to do.

247,AMD," **RIP MY PORTFOLIO & MY PLAN A NEW ONE:**

Got two ports I wanna put up here. Tell me your guys thoughts.

Port 1 - ROTH IRA:

Got about $30k split 67% VTSAX and 33% VFIAX. Nothing else. Contribute the yearly limit at beginning of the year, set, and forget. Don't plan on touching this one unless you guys have some better thoughts.

Port 2 - Brokerage

Have about $105k split between the following:

AMD - ~1% @ $92/share

IPOF - ~1% @ $15.41/share

ARKK - ~1.5% @ $144/share

SCHF - ~9.5% @ $37/share

SCHB - ~39% @ $95.2/share

SWPPX - ~39% @ $59.9/share

Cash - ~9.5%

I'm 26 and willing to take on some risk before I get older. For that reason, thinking about restructuring my port so it's more like this:

248,IPOF," **RIP MY PORTFOLIO & MY PLAN A NEW ONE:**

Got two ports I wanna put up here. Tell me your guys thoughts.

Port 1 - ROTH IRA:

Got about $30k split 67% VTSAX and 33% VFIAX. Nothing else. Contribute the yearly limit at beginning of the year, set, and forget. Don't plan on touching this one unless you guys have some better thoughts.

Port 2 - Brokerage

Have about $105k split between the following:

AMD - ~1% @ $92/share

IPOF - ~1% @ $15.41/share

ARKK - ~1.5% @ $144/share

SCHF - ~9.5% @ $37/share

SCHB - ~39% @ $95.2/share

SWPPX - ~39% @ $59.9/share

Cash - ~9.5%

I'm 26 and willing to take on some risk before I get older. For that reason, thinking about restructuring my port so it's more like this:

BS/Swing Trade Money - 5%

Hi All,

I'm Liam and I am 18 years old. I am currently getting my degrees to be a broker.

I'm currently 6 months into my investment period. I have made about 2.2k from stock that i have invested in. I took a big risk recently with CCIV/Lucid and i bought 100 shares @ 16.45$per share. I have made $**1823.00 and a 124.44% growth.**

I have invested in other firms such as NIO, Atos, Vertex Energy that have done me well too. I sadly impulse bought BB at 22$ per share worth 300$ and im in a negative for this stock. I know BB has great potential but this is a long term stock right?

I also am putting half of my wages into my Savings+Investment account. I do earn 30k+ but this is my first year working as I finished school in March of Last Year. The savings and investment plan averages about a 8% or more Return on Investment. I have made a 4% ROI in the last 3 months of the Savings + Investment Plan.

 where should i allocate my money and how I should look at my portfolio cause it isn't that well diversified

Any suggestions would be very appreciated.

274,DD," Hello, 

maybe someone already did some DD on this company and can provide me with some additional insight.

I stumbled upon some news articles and proceeded to research GAC Group and thought that the fundamentals look promising for their current valuation.

Further they are currently researching a “graphene-based ultra-fast charging battery” (charging 80% of the battery in 8 minutes) that they plan to use this year in their new AION V model. It is already in field-test phase.

They are also working on a silicon-based anode battery which is also in the field-test phase and will be used in the new AION LX model this year. Overall they are aiming to achieve a range of 1000km with this kind of battery.

Official statement: http://iis.aastocks.com/20210118/9588904-0.PDF

To summarise they see the following risks:

“the popularisation of the graphene-based ultra-fast charging battery is subject to the promulgation of relevant national standards on ultra-fast charging and the construction progress of high-power ultra-fast charging equipment; whereas the popularisation of the long endurance silicon- based anode battery is subject to the overall costs of battery and the acceptance level of consumers, and the market demand is uncertain”

Now from my perspective they are working on some promising technology to overcome some main problems of EVs (long charging times and relatively short distance).
Of course such new technology needs some time to drive cost down and get the right infrastructure to work properly.

But why was the stock price seemingly unaffected from this news?
The EV market in general is booming and this company seems to be overlooked, while it is clearly transitioning to EV.

Since i am from Serbia are there any brokerages that work here, web based or app i dont mind. Could also appreciate if someone has recommendations for software for tracking stocks and what are benefits of those suggestions. I think most popular ones i have heard about are Fidelity,Interactive Brokers and Nordnet. If you have some suggestions and which offer best conditions and benefits please help a guy out. Appreciate all the help i can get . I forgot to mention i am more interested in day trading, since it seems more appealing to me, but i am not opposed to long term investment, but dont have 25k$ to start day trading , but i read that there is a rule that you can do 3 day trades per week even if you dont have that kind of money?

Hey guys, in the past month or two, I've been really into the stock market. Every day, is spend at least one hour looking at videos, reddit posts or blogs of investesters.

As I'm not really the type of person to enjoy the risky usage of options, I've built a list of what I would like my portfolio to look like when I actually start investing, and was wondering what you all thought about this :

15% ARKG 15% ARKQ

10% VOO 10% QQQ 10% IVW

20% Stocks

20% Cash

Here's why I would choose these, and btw, feel free to tell me what you think is wrong about my percentages, or my thought behind buying these ETFs.

For the ARK ETFs, I think ARKG and ARKQ both have a very bright future, even if some say that the market is inflated for these type of stocks. Genomic and Autonmous technology/Robotic will affect everyone's daily life or health, and I think investing in these type of companies can be rewarding since it could boom very soon.

Then, I am very aware that VOO, QQQ and IVW are very similar ETFs. VOO contains the whole S&P500, QQQ contains the 100 best NASDAQ companies and IVW focus on Growth stocks in the S&P500 (there's approximately 250 of them IIRC).

* VOO (being the safest choice here) is almost in every case guaranteed to provide me with gains, but lack the growth potential of IVW and QQQ.
* IVW, being cheap and filled with growth stock, could potentially represent higher gains than VOO, but at a risk of being slightly more volatile (since VOO has the Growth AND value stocks of the S&P)
* QQQ, a IVW but on steroids, has been known to outperform the VOO ETF for a while, but this may not be the case in the future years if Tech stocks in the NASDAQ reach their peek. So having this ETF and the two previous ones could benefit me with nice gains, while remaining less volatile than if I had 30% QQQ.

Also, I want to invest 20% of my portfolio in stocks (not necessarily dump them into one stock only) that may have a bright future. I would not invest in big multinationals (like AAPL, AMZN, etc.) since they are already a big part of the ETFs holdings anyway. I would try to find emerging or undervalued company that could pay off in the near future (less than a year). I wouldn't stay for years with the same stocks.

Lastly, I think that keeping a 20% cash to buy big dips, small market crash, or even retrieve if something happens IRL would be interesting and helpful.",TheNumberTw0,1,/r/investing/comments/lgqj12/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gmtbge2/,0.037,0.836,0.127,0.9895

299,APHA," Hi, I'm somewhat new here. I have been stalking for the past week or so trying to get more into the stock market for the long term and make a somewhat profit.

My husband and I have put in some money starting last year, but never enough we weren't okay with losing. We still have young children so don't want to risk everything. However, I don't think our 401k/tsp will ever be enough for retirement.

My husband and I bought about $6000 worth of RCL last year (so 204 shares) and it went up quite a bit. The last 2 days it's been dropping. I'm convinced to keep holding it, we still have a good profit on it and I think it'll start going up eventually. 

I went off advice here and bought TLRY. About 25 shares around $20 and 68 at $26-27. Also bought 63 APHA at $15.90. I noticed it's been going up, but worried it might crash down. Should we hold onto these stocks? Like I said, we're in for long holds for retirement. 

We've also bought GME at $92 but saw it going down so sold at $105 for a little profit. I don't mind selling if the outlook doesn't look good.

Thank you!

305,DD," Greetings Folks!

I am a novice investor and reaching out to the r/investing community with a question on what the right approach is when it comes to my entry point.

I've been following 4 Cannabis ETFs listed below:

|ETF|Price|RSI|
|:-|:-|:-|
|YOLO|$29.00|70|
|MJ|$28.90|82|
|CNBS|$34.80|72|
|THCX|$25.99|71|

With Biden in office and the Democrats in control of both houses I believe that Cannabis legalization is likely in the medium term.  I intend on doing my own DD on some individual companies but like the idea of using these ETFs to ensure I'm able to capture any upsides while I'm doing my research.

Now, onto the question.  At this point in time I have 3 plays on how I can trade this:

1. Watch for a bit and enter when the RSI drops out of the overbought territory.  These ETFs are really pumped right now, the price is probably being driven up in a big buy wave/hype.
2. Buy now, despite being overbought.  I'm bullish and intend to go long here so a dip right now won't really impact my longer term prospects.
3. Buy half as much as I want now, if the trend continues, GREAT!  If the price dips average down.

What criteria/considerations would you be applying to drive your decision on the right play here?  Are there other plays that I'm missing that you might think are worth considering?

307,UK," What's the most cost-efficient way to hedge against a decline in the USD/GBP rate? Most of my assets are currently in USD-denominated accounts but I will eventually move back to the UK. It seems plausible that the GBP could gain significantly against the dollar in the next five years (30%-40% doesn't seem impossible). I don't want to speculate on this, but I want to hedge against it, because it would represent a large loss to me on moving back to the UK.

I looked at using options on FXB (GBP currency ETF) to hedge against this risk, but the losses to theta just seem horrible. I would currently pay between $3k and $4k for at-the-money options covering the value of my current assets, and those options expire in september. So if I held to expiry and rates didn't move, I could easily be paying $7k or $8k a year just to try to hedge against a decline in the value of my assets.

318,CHK,"  **What happens to ""-Q"" investors when a publicly traded company exits bankruptcy?**

 Can someone help me understand what happens when a publicly traded company that went bankrupt, restructures, and exits bankruptcy.

One example which just happened is Chesapeake Energy (CHK) - CHK was listed as CHKAQ until yesterday with a final share price of $3.05. Following CHK's debt restructure, it was re-listed again as CHK at $43. I can't imagine CHKAQ shareholders rolled over 1:1 with new common stock, but it also wouldn't make sense to invest in CHKAQ if you were only going to get $1:$1 when it relisted. Do the CHKAQ shareholders get anything for holding it and staying invested in the company?

Another example looks to be Frontier Communications (FTRCQ) which went into bankruptcy a year ago and is preparing to exit in the next few months. Its been trading at 5-10% of the pre-bankruptcy value, but that doesn't mean much if the CQ investors just become bagholders. From what I've read, FTR had a somewhat negative reputation before (and I'm not a subscriber of theirs), so I'm not encouraging investment by anyone.",one_in_the_mind,1,/r/investing/comments/lgqj12/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gmudp8x/,0.068,0.889,0.042,-0.7894

But how long term is long term? If I’m up 400% on a stock (OCGN in this case) over a couple weeks but I bought with the intention of holding for basically years, it feels crazy not to sell it.

A lot of travel names have run up quite a bit already, so any negative news (other strains, etc) will be a setback.

To be honest, I dont totally understand why a Roth IRA makes stocks better than bonds: I think the main thing is that some bonds don't accrue capital gains tax, so there's no benefit from the Roth IRA in that case. Stocks always accrue capital gains tax, and they produce better returns in general, so the compounding effects are even stronger. More importantly, interest rates on bonds are really low right now, so you're probably much better off just going with stocks.

As for which stocks: you'll probably want to buy broad index-based ETF's (or maybe a mutual fund tracking an index), like over the S&P 500 index or the CRSP total market index or the FTSE total world index.",_im_a_fucking_idiot,3,/r/investing/comments/lgqj12/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gmt1n1v/,0.057,0.768,0.175,0.9697

1. The stock ramped into earnings and was priced for great and only delivered good.

2. Commentary and/or guidance is not positive. Guidance is very important. Something can beat on last quarter's earnings and if guidance/commentary for the business going forward is not very good, then that's what the stock is going to trade on and possibly go lower. GM did beat on earnings and the stock is up slightly, but that guidance was not very good (perhaps due to the chip shortage?

390,ABNB," >	“Airbnb’s market cap is equal to 16% of the total $$ spent on global travel, but it only accounts for 5% of travel accommodation spending.” (https://twitter.com/seemacnbc/status/1359533993054601223)

Interesting way of putting it. I have a small position that I bought at IPO and intend on holding it for a very long time.

My reasoning being that in the future ABNB has many ways to make money and be of value to hosts - for example the long-term rental market is ripe given that young folk are being priced out of ownership at a rapid clip. Corporate expat housing contracts are another idea whereby ABNB become the intermediary between hosts and corporations looking to house expats on extended work engagements (much like hotels do now).

With young folks being open to working abroad more than ever and being priced out of ownership in their home cities, I think the future might be spending your 20s working for leading companies in foreign destinations.   Commonwealth visas allow this now but I can see it gaining popularity.

Just my randomized thoughts.

While I agree that travel isn’t going to come back with the same fervour, I do think the work landscape has forever changed and a few years from now, twenty-somethings would welcome the opportunity to work/live abroad - and Airbnb will certainly make the living part easy.",Hutz_Lionel,1,/r/investing/comments/lgqj12/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gmv3ytv/,0.0,0.833,0.167,0.9905

401,CRSP," Yeah it's really confusing, but it just takes a lot of reading. A brief explanation: the S&P 500 index is a weighted list of the top 500 largest U.S. companies. The weight is the market capitalization of the company. Market capitalization is `num_shares * share_price`. If you graph the sum of the weighted list over time, it basically looks like an approximation for all the large companies in the U.S. stock market.

Lots of people think that if you make your portfolio of investments match an index like this, you'll get annual returns in the realm of 10-12% (not adjusted for inflation, I think), because it's basically just expecting that the U.S. stock market will grow over time. By investing in the top 500, you get a lot of diversification, and by weighting by market-cap, you're matching the weighting that the market has determined. Sometimes the market is wrong and weights stocks too highly or lowly, but overall it's supposed to be a pretty good approximation.

There's lots of different kinds of mutual funds, and some of them offer to match the S&P 500. They'll take your money and create a portfolio that matches the weighted list as closely as possible, and when you want to get out, they'll go sell your shares and give you the profits.

ETF's are the successors to mutual funds: all you have to do is buy shares of the ETF, and market makers will create/delete ETF shares from the market and buy/sell the underlying index's stocks to do so. You don't have to rely on the mutual fund people to buy/sell stuff, you rely on the market maker like regular stocks. ETF's are also better cause you pay less taxes.

Big ETF's that track the S&P 500 include SPY, IVV, and VOO. QQQ tracks the NASDAQ top 100. VTI tracks the CRSP index, VT tracks the FTSE. These are all indexes that are basically just weighted samples of different markets.

There's also some ETF's that don't track indexes, where a company is selecting stocks and weighting them. That's basically just an actively-managed mutual fund, where people are trying to come up with strategies for stock picking. Those are considered much more risky, and the financial theory behind them is more sketchy. But sometimes they make way better returns.

Before investing in anything, I would just say, try to understand exactly what you're doing. Ultimately the stock market is basically a ponzi scheme, as far as I understand. You buy now, and assume that someday you'll be able to sell your stock to somebody at a higher price, and then he'll do the same thing. I mean, the safest thing to do is keep your money in the bank, but then you start losing ~3% due to inflation every year, so idk, it seems like you might as well put it in stocks.",_im_a_fucking_idiot,2,/r/investing/comments/lgqj12/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gmt9njn/,0.036,0.838,0.126,0.9926
402,EV," ""Given that GM's future is geared towards EV development and has taken a stance for zero carbon emissions by 2035 (or 2030 - don't remember)""

The issue with investing for 10 years from now IMO is that people start buying certain themes as if 2030 is tomorrow; stocks can get *way* ahead of themselves and if you buy something that has gotten way ahead of itself, you can be long-term directionally right but be a bagholder for a period.

An extreme example of this recently was QS; hype ramped it well over $100, despite the fact that the product I don't believe actually is coming until 2025 - but people were buying like it was happening tomorrow. When the hype-driven momentum stopped and the stock returned to reality, it quickly went down about 50%.

 It might actually still be a big thing in 2025 when the product comes out, but if you bought at $132.73 (the top on 12/22) and now the stock is $46 you're probably not pleased that you bought into the hype and are now bagholding and hoping that it's eventually a big thing - or people in that situation just dump and take the loss. You can be directionally long-term right about something and still wind up bagholding for long periods of time if you buy at the wrong time into hype. Again, great to be excited about a long-term theme but you still want to buy at a decent price and not get carried away with allocation due to excitement over the theme.

When I mention guidance, companies often give guidance for either the next quarter, the full year or both (many didn't do that at times over the last year due to Covid uncertainty, but it's starting to more commonly be done again.) GM's EPS guidance for FY21 was moderately under what analysts were looking for.

It's fine to think long-term in terms of growth themes, but you just don't want to get too carried away buying now (and a lot of EV-related things have been a ""buy at any price"" mania lately) for 2025 or 2030 views.",dvdmovie1,2,/r/investing/comments/lgqj12/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gmti6kn/,0.051,0.856,0.093,0.9305

If I have less than 50k in a taxable account should I look into other brokerages (are there any with similar rates)? or just wait until I have enough for IB Pro to make sense? Also, I think the Lite margin rate is like 2.5%, is that really enough to make the leverage not worth it?

Which makes borrowing via box spreads similar to borrowing with futures; the borrowing rate is effectively tax-deductible.

439,EV," I stumbled upon some news articles and proceeded to research GAC Group and thought that the fundamentals look promising for their current valuation.

Further they are currently researching a “graphene-based ultra-fast charging battery” (charging 80% of the battery in 8 minutes) that they plan to use this year in their new AION V model. It is already in field-test phase.

They are also working on a silicon-based anode battery which is also in the field-test phase and will be used in the new AION LX model this year. Overall they are aiming to achieve a range of 1000km with this kind of battery.

Official statement: http://iis.aastocks.com/20210118/9588904-0.PDF

To summarise they see the following risks:

“the popularisation of the graphene-based ultra-fast charging battery is subject to the promulgation of relevant national standards on ultra-fast charging and the construction progress of high-power ultra-fast charging equipment; whereas the popularisation of the long endurance silicon- based anode battery is subject to the overall costs of battery and the acceptance level of consumers, and the market demand is uncertain”

Now from my perspective they are working on some promising technology to overcome some main problems of EVs (long charging times and relatively short distance).
Of course such new technology needs some time to drive cost down and get the right infrastructure to work properly.

But why was the stock price seemingly unaffected from this news?
The EV market in general is booming and this company seems to be overlooked, while it is clearly transitioning to EV.

I will never really know due to the rigged game we are playing but that is how I feel (note this is only my opinion and not targeting Piper here but someone in the know surely made a fortune on this pump down and up).""

If you have a long-term view on Beyond Meat (not me personally, I think there are better tasting vegan products but that's just my view), then buy it for the long-term and realize that there are going to be upgrades/downgrades along the way and other news. I started buying Trade Desk at $70 and it got to nearly $1000 before pulling back. There have certainly been downgrades, a Citron short thesis and other news stories along the way. It happens; there will be setbacks along the way for any company. I continued to research when things happened along the way, continued to feel comfortable owning and still do..

Additionally, I am someone who fully believes that if someone has a short thesis you should read it and be open to people who have a different view than you do; I've had instances where a short thesis has helped me get out of something before things got worse or at the very least allowed me to see an aspect of a company differently. Sometimes I have not agreed with a short thesis, but the decline was a buying opportunity. Said thank you, bought more and that's it; too many people turn shorts into some sort of villains. The sort of civil discourse about investing has eroded over the years and that's a bummer because I think investing really is a continual learning experience and you have to be open to potentially learning from people who have differing views. Analysts I'm somewhat less interested in either way but I'll still certainly take a look at reports.

Not saying this to OP, but I'm just seeing more posts about how things are ""manipulated"" and ""rigged"" and various conspiracy theories - if you get too much into thinking that everything negative about your stock is some sort of manipulation, then you start to become oblivious to the possibility that perhaps the stock is acting negative because of genuine reasons and that's always something to try to be aware of the possibility of. If you have done the research and feel strongly about a company, buy some, if it goes down materially buy a bit more. If there's a negative analyst report or otherwise, be open to what it might have to say, research again (and really often think through your investments not just as to what could go well for the company, but what could be potential issues in the years ahead) and if you feel comfortable, buy a bit more if there's an opportunity or do nothing. Wash, rinse, repeat.

I have heard people mention the ETF VEGN before but it hardly seems like a plant-based ETF considering it's top 10 holdings are pretty much all the most popular/hyped stocks on the entire market. TSLA, GOOG, AAPL, MSFT, V, MA... Do they even believe in actual vegan companies or do they just use the name for vegans who want to jump on a bandwagon without doing any research?

Might not be a bad play but considering how many ETFs hold all those stocks, I see no reason.

If you sell the 250 shares for more than you bought them PLUS the wash sale amount, that zeros the was sale and you can trade the ticker again within 30 days without any wash sale (loss) carrying forward.

479,BNGO," Wait a minute, you've got $24,000,000 coming in over the next 12 months and you're debating over how aggressively you're going to invest it?  Why?  What's the end objective?

I invest pretty aggressively, but I do that so I can accumulate enough cash so that I don't have to work anymore.  If I had $24,000,000, that goal would be accomplished - not just for me, but for my kids too.

So the first payment, I probably wouldn't do much of anything.  Maybe put it in a CD or some Treasury Bills.  Then do that for the next 12 months - get my $24 million - and *then* start thinking about what to do with it.

My main goal would be ""don't fuck this up""; which is going to mean being pretty conservative with the vast majority of it.  Maybe taking a million or so to ""play with"" if I was bored and wanted something to do with my day.

But if you take that first payment and put half of it into GME and BNGO, what are you going to do when they fail, the market tanks and you lost 80% of it?  My guess is that you're going to try to ""make it up"" with risky investments from the future payments.  And that's got a dangerous opportunity to put you in the hold chasing gains.

Your number 1 priority right now should be to have $24,000,000 one year from now.  You've hit the lottery - take your win.  Finish out the contract and retire.
