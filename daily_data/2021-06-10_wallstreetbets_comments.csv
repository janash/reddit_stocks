19,UK," To my knowledge she is seen as a cause of much poverty and inequality in the UK in part due to a focus on privatization of previous government areas.

I think she is perceived as having cut down and sold off the UK in the name of economic growth, while it seems to have done nothing to help those most in need of economic help.

I suspect it's a case of either thinking that if the country as a whole is economically sound, then the individual people are irrelevant (or perhaps - will also do alright), while a more cynical take is that she threw poor people under the boss to appease ideological goals eventually assisting the rich. 

I can't say I've much personal stake in Thatcher individually, but I have tried to link [this](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/15/neoliberalism-ideology-problem-george-monbiot) article whenever I get a chance to.

It sounds good to the average retard and the top comments are all just confirmation bias with no one calling OP out on his bullshit. I thought the ape, diamond hands, rocket, and moon emojis were amusing during the initial GME climb but now it's just plain cringe as fuck.

I hope people are taking their profits because this shit isn't going to last and there's going to be a ton of bag holding.

Keep in mind though, CLF is starting with a decent size market cap, so it's harder for retail to move this.

Bearish: Their market cap is currently 50 times higher than GME's when it started it's run, but still half of GME's current market cap. As retail spreads across more meme stocks the power dilutes. Higher debt than others in their space (possible no longer true see below)

Bullish: CLF had a $25 price target by some analysts prior to meme stock status. They paid off $400 million debt several years early. CLF benefits from rising prices of steel due to vertical integration.

141,HUGE," Yes. Options, unlike stocks, are not a zero-sum game. You can win HUGE with the right put/call, but you can also lose vastly more than you put in. There are a few examples of this happening both ways, with the likes of u/ControlTheNarrative (infinite money hack) and u/1r0nyman (Contracts exercised? What?) being fine examples of it going so tits up they literally lost the shirts off their back.

262,GME," #MATHS BREAKDOWN, BABY.

There are 6.5m total investors in GME - 1.5% (98k users) of these are from eToro. 62% of eToro users voted. This was ~700,000 shares cast.

We can make an *assumption* that the 1.5% owns *roughly* about 11.5 shares per holder as of April 15th, due to this. When you multiply 11.5 × 6.5m you end up with 74.5m. That's just slightly over outstanding shares.

#BUT

The thing is... there *aren't* institutional investors in eToro. The 11.5 share is *entirely based on what eToro GME holders own.*

There is *no evidence* to suggest that eToro holders are significantly demographically different from other brokers, but the ranges are as follows (*assuming* the float is 55m shares):

5 shares = 59% of float is owned by retail.  
10 shares = 118% of float is owned by retail.  
*11.5 shares = 135% of float is owned by retail.*  
15 shares = 177% of float is owned by retail.  

So, why does any of this noise matter? Has anyone *seen* a bloomberg terminal lately for GME? Retail ownership is **vastly** under reported... last I saw it was *<5%* ownership. I'm not saying we *shouldn't* trust Bloomberg terminal, but someone is feeding bogus data somewhere.

289,GME," > I'm always perplexed as to why a lot of stocks dip after beating earnings projections.

>Has anyone heard a good explanation for that?


Personally no clue, however I was also curious so I did a quick search. According to Google:



**What cause stocks to drop?**

*Any downward revisions to future sales, earnings, cash flow, and more could lead to concerns over the stock's future value. Downward revisions or developments that decrease future value expectations can be a fundamental reason why a stock might fall alongside good news.*


**Why do stocks go down when they beat earnings?**

*A company can post an earnings beat while also lowering their earnings guidance. i.e. During the earnings report, they could lower their predictions for future sales or profits. This lowered guidance can frighten investors and lower the share price.*



That’s for a normal stock though, so it might not apply as much or at all to GME maybe. Not sure.",MonsiuerGeneral,5,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nwjw4u/gme_q1_earnings_megathread_the_morning_after/h1a25f8/,0.119,0.775,0.106,0.1969

410,CLF," **Another Way to Profit from CLF is selling covered calls. It's not glamorous or sexy, but it's very profitable with a stock like CLF.**   
CLF is running due to higher commodity prices, and analysts are increasing the target price. This is one industry that’s not hurt by higher prices. In fact, with the global shortage of commodities, CLF is in a great position. They can raise prices without affecting demand, so that should continue to boost earnings. 

If you’re long CLF, an additional way to profit is to sell covered calls as the price increases. That means you’re giving someone else the option to buy your calls if it hits the strike price. The good news is that premiums are high enough that you can make a decent gain on calls expiring next Friday (8 days from now). You're not making a long commitment, and you get a quick reward.   
Wait until later in the day for the price to go up (always sell covered calls when the stock is rising), then sell 1 covered call for each 100 shares you own. For example:   
**CLF 06/18/2021 27.00 C (expires in 8 days)**  
Sell to Open at limit price of $1.50 (1 call per 100 shares)  
If you own 1,000 shares, sell 10 Calls at $1.50 will generate an extra $1,500. If it is below $27 next Friday, you pocked the $1,500 premium and you still own the stock. You can then sell more covered calls with higher strike prices as the stock increases, thus making income over and over- until it gets called away. Each time you sell covered calls, you limit the upside, but you effectively lower your purchase price. If it goes above $27 before expiration, you make the profit on the stock up to $27, plus a $1,500 bonus.   
This strategy is ideal for stocks that are steadily rising. If CLF skyrockets, your stock will get called away. If it goes up to $26 and the options expire worthless, you can then sell more covered calls at a higher strike price. This isn’t as glamorous or sexy as making a 1,000% gain overnight, but CLF is the kind of stock that will likely grind higher and higher, offering an additional income opportunity.

""STEEL PRICES ARE GOING TO STAY HIGH. Why?  
Chinese steel accounts for 15-20% of the global export market, and they’ve all but stopped exporting - they eliminated Tax rebate incentives for steel producers last month in a bid to keep supply grounded domestically for their own affordable infrastructure stimulus and carbon emissions goals, and have been floating rumors of an export tax the past two weeks. 15% of the worlds export tonnage drying up is HUGE - the leftover demand will NEED to come from somewhere.""

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  


Due to overgrown Chinese infrastructure capacity, projects and materials like steel have been outbound for a very long time. This is in particular since the Belt & Road Initiative (BRI) but also  to avoid an impending ""bust"" from China's construction boom. This boom was characterized by extreme overspending on unnecessary infrastructure and expropriations by municipal authorities (see: ghost cities, urban displacement, see also bailouts to Chinese municipal level governments). 

If the export rebates are trimmed, believe me it is not to keep that steel within China — it is much more likely that this is in order to help maintain or expand market access for that steel. Removing export subsidies would combat the (accurate) view from export markets that Chinese steel is subsidized and therefore import tariffs are necessary to protect local steel. Meanwhile, a lot of this steel is heading towards BRI countries where  Chinese construction capacity can be put to use. That would not be consistent with a shortage on steel.  


\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
""Additionally, the 2022 Beijing olympics are around the corner, and who remembers what china did in an effort to combat smog prior to the 2008 games? They shuttered steel production in Beijing/Hebei, one of the largest steel producing provinces. Less Chinese steel = higher ex-China prices.""

569,USA," Saw G'ma Cathy talking about a commodity bubble today.

People want to spend on services that they haven't had in a year. They've already got durable goods from being couped up for a year. Computers, washing machines, vibrators.

Commodities are double or more but they are ripe for a fall.

You say housing is about to stumble? Okay, that's a stove, washer, dryer, water heater, furnace, and a/c that isn't being bought for each new house.

But the big threat is commercial real estate. Lots of companies haven't been paying their rent and theyve been repackaging mortgage securities like they are worth something. It's not that big of a market. It probably will only hurt the housing market a little. But commercial buildings use a lot more steel and concrete. That's where you'll feel it first. 

Maybe they could pull that out if companies got their employees back into the office, but employees don't want to go back into the office.

Why should they? They've got all their durable goods at home and fuck, now they only need one car (if that).

Steel has been booming for months now. Not that they'd notice at my work where me manufacture HVAC duct for commercial and government buildings. Back when Trump started his trade war we started stockpiling steel for our operations. We've got a one year supply of cold rolled galvanized steel rolls made right here in the USA.

I'll bet a dollar the increased demand over the last few years has been stockpiling to hedge against trade war fluctuations. If prices get too high well just dip into our six month supply.",Bull_Winkle69,-2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nweryx/clf_is_the_least_risky_meme_stock_this_sub_has/h1ba1r4/,0.091,0.845,0.064,-0.9338

936,UWMC," ""Realistic DD"" with no bear case? K

Just to play devil's advocate here, UWMC has had stellar results because of record low interest rates driving refinances along with people buying homes to escape the city or apartment living during quarantine.

For one, at some point you reach saturation on refinances, people don't refinance every year.

Second, rising interest rates could reduce the volume of refis. Rates may not immediately increase but eventually they should come up.

Third, if the housing market cools off the volume of new mortgage originations could drop as well.

Short term? Probably right that it has some room to run, but medium term it seems choppy at best because of the risks above.",pseudoanonymity,11,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nwa3gh/realistic_dd_on_uwmc/h18cka4/,0.076,0.795,0.129,0.7893

938,UWMC," First off, there are a ton of bagholders in the upper $10s and $11s that want out of this stock asap.  Second, ex-divi day was today, so everybody that just wanted to scalp the dividend off this stock could dump shares.  I would expect some ex-divi dumping to occur.  Third, UWMC has NOT been included in the Russell 2000 and is not on any short list to be.  If they were in contention they would have been on the list last week with the 3000 and micro cap inclusions as well.

Devils advocate: if the bagholders see positive movement, they may hold and not panic sell once they hit their cost basis and see if they can go for a squeeze ride.  Same with the dividend scalpers.  There also may be a miracle and UWMC could make it to the Russell with some work on the corporate side and convincing them that they do in fact meet the criteria.

958,UWMC," The Russel Index Reconstitution process takes place over an entire month. It is described in detail here: [https://www.ftserussell.com/resources/russell-reconstitution](https://www.ftserussell.com/resources/russell-reconstitution)

UWMC was not included on the preliminary list released last Friday; however, the process allows for updates and revisions each week this month.

The best theory for why it was excluded is that the company failed to clear the ""Minimum Voting Rights Hurdle"". You can learn all about that hurdle here: [https://research.ftserussell.com/products/downloads/Minimum\_Voting\_Rights\_Hurdle\_FAQ.pdf?\_ga=2.158045113.2035201761.1602685218-1267924083.1596218340](https://research.ftserussell.com/products/downloads/Minimum_Voting_Rights_Hurdle_FAQ.pdf?_ga=2.158045113.2035201761.1602685218-1267924083.1596218340)

The TL;DR is that the company must have a minimum of 5% of the voting power of its stock in the publicly available Free Float.

Instead, UWMC was included on the ""Indicative List of Affected Securities"" - which means they were excluded for some reason or other: [https://imgur.com/a/M8A4qK9](https://imgur.com/a/M8A4qK9)

You can see here that FTSE (the business which manages the Russel indices) calculated the *Voting Power in Public Ownership* as 0.61%.

Now this is speculation, but I believe UWMC will be appealing this calculation. I believe this because it erroneously calculates the class D shares (which have 10 votes each) at their full voting power, when in reality, they are presently restricted to 79% of the vote by virtue of a clause in their S-1 filing with the SEC, which you can read here: [https://docoh.com/filing/1783398/0001193125-21-016729/UWMC-S1](https://docoh.com/filing/1783398/0001193125-21-016729/UWMC-S1)

>Our Charter provides that, in no event shall a holder of Common Stock, together with one or more other “includable corporations” (as defined in the Code) of such holder or entities disregarded as separate from such holder for U.S federal income tax purposes, be entitled to vote in excess of 79% of the voting power of the holders of the outstanding shares then voting together as a single class on such matter.

If UWMC has already appealed this calculation, it is possible they will be added to the preliminary Russel inclusion list this Friday. If not, they still have two more chances to have it corrected.",l8nite,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nwa3gh/realistic_dd_on_uwmc/h18uywp/,0.05,0.86,0.09,0.9231

Of course it depends on the stock but I like UWMC and am taking this one as more of a gamble than a smart play. Only putting a couple hundred towards these options, and I own 300 shares that I’ll be holding through earnings. 

I don’t expect UWMC to hit $20, but if it does I’m going to be a happy man. If it only hits $15 (august calls) I’ll close out before earnings and maybe miss out on a couple hundred bones if I had purchased the further ITM calls instead. Either way I’m not too upset.

I'm not going to speculate on price target however, too much of that going on around here lately and it's worthless. It only ever seems to set unrealistic expectations that is harmful to those who can't discern between reasonable DD and actual bullshit, and that's not cool. If there were some predictable trend here that would be a little different, but this is absolutely a short squeeze Play and nothing more. Because of that what happens tomorrow or any of the following days is anyone's guess.

1079,CLOV, As a total newb I have the same question. I am just dipping my toes into options and it seems hard to determine the correct stop loss and whether placing them damage’ the flow.  I suspect that the market makers know that magic number and work to reach it. I just started options last week with CLOV and I was giddy with my huge gain yesterday. I sold today (for 70% less 😢)my $9 6/18 and somewhat regret dumping my $10 7/2.  I purchased both for $175 and I got $1680 out so I am pleased with the results in less than a week.

1591,ATH," Best advice I can give you, if you care for it, is that you never know where the peak will be.  If you had sold GME when it was +300%, you would have been nowhere near the peak.  So how do you know that $CLOV is going to peak at +300%?  You don't.

What I do is set a ""safe"" personal price target based on the thesis and stick to it (or try to).  For $CLOV I thought the story of heavily shorted + low float + Russell 500 inclusion + gamma squeeze was a good one.  Could it go up 1,000%?  Maybe.  But what I know is its ATH before the short report and hype was $17 and those 4 points I mentioned + the hype probably mean it's good for at least $17 and then some.  So I set a personal ""safe"" price target of $20-25 for a safe date of November and bought calls.  When it spiked over $20, I sold.  It was past my safe point.  If I miss out on +500% more in gains, so be it.  I happened to sell almost exactly at the peak here, but really that was just luck. For $SPCE, for example, it has continued to run after I sold my calls a week or so ago.

Now CLOV is back down at $14, which is even lower than the ATH before the hype.  I don't believe the run is over at all.  So I bought back in with a $20 strike and will likely sell if it goes over $20 again.

For WISH, I think there's no reason it shouldn't hit ATHs again.  That's a triple just in stock.  Notably, professional analysts also think the stock is good for a 100% rally.  But that's not a safe bet for me, and for options, I like to be a little safe.  I lose money to theta, after all, and sometimes IV.  So I set my safe PT for WISH at half ATHs at $15 or so...   Even after that spike yesterday, it hasn't even gotten to my safe PT, which is why I didn't sell this one, and in fact bought a little more - $15 January calls.  Seems a safe bet.

If I'm off from the bottom and it goes down, I average down... Assuming I still like my thesis and the amount of time I have left.

- Chamath likes to pump “game changing” companies…but none have done shit yet…maybe 10/20 years from now…if that’s the timeline…they shouldn’t be public yet.

- SPACs are always risky…almost no financial disclosure vs an IPO/DPO. For the 1,000 that have launched this year…maybe 5 are legit.

We've seen before how media can really influence people to buy/sell, especially when you got places like CNBC calling us out for CLOV today. Yet no where did they mention that CLOV announced a partnership with a couple home healthcare providers  to expand into that market.

If you are still going to follow along, you should take a look at the CLOV subreddit, alot of the market talk is over my head, but even before yesterday they were predicting it to drop to the teens. I don't understand the market talk, it's over my head, so I don't understand their reasoning, but they guessed it. They also are talking about June 18, it's getting listed in some Russel market,  and 30,000 shares have to be purchased to be listed in that market.

1955,AMC," Have to say today was a frustrating day with CLOV. If people weren't so easily scared off the squeeze could have continued today.

A large portion of the float is tied up. Institutions and insiders hold over 40% of the float and since the company went publicly recently the shares are still short term so can't be easily traded.

The stock is heavily shorted with the last report at 41% and the past few days most likely meant more borrowed shares.

Short borrow fees are over 100% with little to no shares available. Most shorts got in when the price was low and in some cases they will be at double right now, so more than they bargained for.

If we hit $22 by EOW over 200,000 calls are in the money which would push a gamma squeeze.

What makes it attractive is the low public float at a reasonable price. Trading 500 million shares of CLOV costs a third of what it would need for AMC. The call options are already purchased and just waiting to be used so setting up a gamma squeeze doesn't require a high cost of entry like GME and AMC.

CEO of AMC literally admitted that he's using reddit kids stock money to pay off debts - stock is worth about 2-6$ - you think that AMC is going to go up? with what?

AMC’s monthly cash burn was about $124 million in the fourth quarter. AMC managed to defer $450 million of rent obligations during the pandemic, but they start becoming due this year. The company is actively negotiating for rent abatements or additional deferrals to remain liquid.

AMC could manage to reduce its total obligation, but it’s hard to imagine the company’s landlords eliminating or even deferring rent much further — especially considering the company just raised north of $1 billion from equity and debt issuances, which is public information.

AMC has $5.8 billion of long-term debt — expensive debt that will further restrict future cash flows.

So how you think this company is going to fly north I have no idea. Movie business is dead - theaters will never return to what it was. Reddit kid money being used to pay debts - not investments. But yeah whatever hero you thinks going to push it to the sky go right ahead - but these ain't the movies.",Ready-Journalist-371,5,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nw6lmm/a_quick_dd_on_clov_borrowing_fee/h17pog5/,0.151,0.802,0.048,-0.9672

2053,BB," I didn't understand shit about all the technical stuff that was said in this presentation - definitely was too advanced for my retarded brain. But what stuck out to me was the idea of the current industry focus on responding to a cyber threat versus BB's focus on preventing cyber threats from happening. This is definitely an edge and this company needs to do better at **COMMUNICATING** and **MARKETING** this. This is their shtick. Luckily for BB, Colonial Pipeline and JBS got fucked in the ass by the ransomware gangs and now companies will try to avoid this situation and will look towards preventative measures rather than just buying Bitcoin. I would love to see BB go all out on marketing to let people know that they're still alive and not just a bottom-of-the-barrel meme stock that makes diamond handers feel like they they wanna be paper handers after this sideways week.

2109,CLF," I don't see a catalyst for CLF to be fast money. I think it is a good value play. They have the ore and make the finished products. They have made a lot of acquisitions over the past year with Arcelor-Mittal and AK Steel facilities being the big ones. Steel is absolutely a cyclical business and this summer should be really good to CLF so I am betting on good earnings in August. 

I am a steel buyer by trade and speak with mills on a regular basis and just about our entire industry expects that prices will not come down this year. Demand is high, mills running at less than typical capacity, foreign steel is expensive and availability is low, scrap prices continue to rise, supply chain is disrupted, and everyone just really likes making money.

A large portion of the float is tied up. Institutions and insiders hold over 40% of the float and since the company went publicly recently the shares are still short term so can't be easily traded.

The stock is heavily shorted with the last report at 41% and the past few days most likely meant more borrowed shares.

Short borrow fees are over 100% with little to no shares available. Most shorts got in when the price was low and in some cases they will be at double right now, so more than they bargained for.

If we hit $22 by EOW over 200,000 calls are in the money which would push a gamma squeeze.

What makes it attractive is the low public float at a reasonable price. Trading 500 million shares of CLOV costs a third of what it would need for AMC. The call options are already purchased and just waiting to be used so setting up a gamma squeeze doesn't require a high cost of entry like GME and AMC.

2136,CLOV," For those of you holding CLOV that are freaking out, I suggest you read up on the Elliot Wave theory. Major uptrends in stock price happen in 5 major waves. The first wave is the impulsive wave, the first breakout to the upside which shows the start of an uptrend. Then the second wave is the first correction wave. The correction wave in an uptrend is usually around 40-60 percent of the length of the impulsive wave. Then we get in to the third wave, the second impulsive wave, which is normally the wave with the most upside. Then the second corrective wave, then the last impulsive wave. Which totals to 3 major waves. Now with this in mind, give the CLOV chart a look. You will notice right away it appears we had the first major impulsive wave from 13to 28. That was the break of the sideways trend and the start of the uptrend. That is a 124  percent move up. Now if we look at the recent pullback that trolls want to call a “crash” there was a 50 percent move to the downside. That pullback is about in the range of the 40-60 percent of the length of the move up, sound familiar right? Now with signs of a bottom of 15.9, MACD curling up and breaking out to the upside on the 30 minute chart, and price currently at 17.15 at the time of writing this, we are seeing signs the second impulsive wave has just started. Trolls love to say the clov run is over, but in reality this is just the definition of an uptrend. This pullback was healthy and expected to continue the move up. As for the short squeeze, with the short fee now at a record high of 116 percent (I have never seen the fee that high for any stock before) I suspect shorts will start covering during the second impulsive wave up. Clov apes do not give in to the BS, we are right at the tip of the short squeeze and to give up now would be stupid.

2296,AMC, I resist pointing out to them that AMC is using their fantasy to their advantage.  I started reducing my stake the second they announced they were issuing shares (which the cult gobbled up).  AMC management is unloading shares for prices they never thought possible (which the cult gobbled up).  AMC’s creditors converted their debt to equity and sold shares (which the cult gobbled up).  They all claim to buying and holding but if 80% of the company is owned by retail investors and there is that much volatility they are clearly competing against each other.,BarkingCat450,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nwtnri/wkhs_and_why_it_could_be_a_nobrainer/h1buw8u/,0.018,0.882,0.1,0.7269

Another aspect is you have so much attention on a ticker like WISH that it gets pumped and FOMO pumped to the point where algos kick in and cover and I'm sure institutions are playing w/retail here to whip them in and out of the trade.

2663,AMC," Maybe.  I'm still skeptical for the reason I think they are just shifting into another business that is on a downtrend.  I don't know if you play games but what Microsoft is doing with gamepass is the future to me.  If I can pay 15 bucks a month and get access to that vast a catalogue and one that is only growing then wheres the market for digital copies?  

The biggest knock on digital from the get go well you dont physically own the game because if so and so company goes under theres no way to play what you bought.  This was the original argument against digital and whether its right or wrong it brings up the point that well why even buy them in the first place when I can just goto gamepass and get that game I like plus many more for a full 25% of the cost of a retail copy.

Thats the problem I see with gamestop in the future while yes they are in a better position obviously than they were last year I don't see how they catch up with where the industry is heading since the entire business is moving towards making sure places like gamestop dont exist.

2780,WISH," $Wish: Let’s talk fundamentals.

Wish management has the following long term financial targets: 

-25-30% (of revenue) Cost of goods sold

-40-45% sales and marketing expense

-8-9% Gen and Admin expense

This implies long term net income margins of 16-27%. Analysts believe they will continue to grow revenue by 20-25% per year over the next several years.

Looking out 5 years to 2026 if we assume conservatively: 

-19% annual revenue growth from 2021 projected $3.2 billion 

-15% net income margin in 2026

-We get $7.64 billion in revenue and $1.146 billion non gaap net income. Put a conservative p/e multiple on that and you can see that the fundamentals will be dragging the share price much much higher over time.   

Finally, Future growth opportunities from Wish’s investor relations website:


Multiple growth opportunities with new product expansion
* Wish Local opens up large growth opportunity
* Consumer goods and branded product expand catalog
* Open Wish platform for logistics and marketing as a service

Some notes on the above.. Wish local allows brick and mortar retail shops to store wish inventory for very low cost, unlike expensive Amazon fulfillment center real estate. The retail store gets the benefit of potential new customers walking in their door to pick up wish packages, they have the option to deliver the package for wish (for compensation), and they get to upload their own inventory to wish’s platform to reach a global customer base. This also helps wish reduce shipping times. It’s a win win. There were over 55,000 wish local partners as of Q1. 

Wish is focusing on getting more expensive (branded) products on the platform because they note it’s more profitable to sell higher priced goods, or at least multiple cheap goods in one delivery. They’re focusing marketing strategy on retaining high Life Time Value customers, as opposed to people that buy once and never return. 

Their logistics revenue grew 300% in 2020 to over $500 million. This logistics segment alone is worth far more than the current market cap. Logistics margins aren’t as profitable as market place or product boost (advertising revenue), but their logistics margins are improving and will be a profit center In a couple more quarters. 

Please read the Q4 2020, Q1 2021 shareholder letters. 

Not financial advice. Full disclosure I’m long the stock (obviously) and very bullish.

https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm

Download the May zip file. Ctrl+f for WISH. You’ll see over 800k fails to deliver. This list is as of May 14. The second half of May wont be posted until the middle of June but with volume like this odds are the fails to deliver quantity for WISH will have exploded. While you’re at it compare WISH to the other memes… you’ll see over 800k fail to delivers for WISH and less for the rest…

Not financial advice…

That was the fails when volume was at 30m or less. Now the volume is 10X. So what do you think the fails are at now??",howhowardshowered,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nwdwv3/wish_yolo_update/h18vcpx/,0.046,0.793,0.161,0.9935

2783,WISH," WISH is spending millions a year on fancy houses in LA and Las Vegas for “influencers” to pose in and have parties at for free. They spend $500,000 a month on just their mansion in LA. Let that sink in.

2914,CLF," Copied this multiple times at this point - 

CLF is pretty much the only WSB short interest play with limited fundamental downside; they’re shitting money and have a ton of macroeconomic tailwinds. If you think its late for CLF you’re probably not aware of the industry landscape or the companies footing in it.

UWMC you could argue is another one that is currently shitting money, but the outlook for mortgages is awful. Housing starts down 3 months in a row; share valuations are forward looking, and that’s why UWMC isn’t going anywhere.

This is not the case for steel demand - its robust as hell and shipping constraints/ Trade policy (read up on china’a role in the export steel market) / Nations using infrastructure-as-stimulus post-covid / industry consolidation more than likely keep things hot.
