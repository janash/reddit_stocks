0,MS," 10x problem - as others astutely mentioned, Mixer was a disaster, EVEN AFTER paying top Twitch streamers to swtich - Ninja being one of the huge names.   Mixer was not 10x better; hence no take-up.   Comment regarding Teamspeak - Discord is 10X better and hit great timing with tech/games and TBH Teamspeak didn't keep up.  So no, folks are not married to Discord, but the solution that replaces it will need to be 10x better.

Another case in point - what if MS offered it's own GitHub... ohh wait they do, it's called TFS.  It would be the exact same situation as Mixer.  They were lucky GitHub sold to them.

Cable? That's been dying. Massive telecom & film studio consolidation has all been for the sole purpose of competing with Netflix and Amazon. Some of them will certainly try and use some sketchy non competitive bull, watch for net neutrality to continue to be a major issue.

Cinema? Please that's basically a subscription service where you make less than  15 bucks a ticket and not everyone is going to your movie. average viewers were going maybe once a month before covid. We may see a surge as people get out and about after lockdown but I dont see a viable long term path for theaters and studios are finally getting used to cutting them out anyway.

Back catalogs you have a point on, but only because studios figured out that the reason Netflix wanted to rent their catalog was so they could make bank off of it, and then basically charged netflix to pay them to create their own services (also part of why there's been so much studio consolidation). But most people want to watch more recent stuff. They arent paying 20 bucks a month to watch titanic at will.

Netflix's niche is 100% personalized content. They make a TON of stuff. Everyone is saying ""they have so much junk"" guess what that junk absolutely was targeted for someone who isnt you. Yes they have some big mass appeal stuff but they are getting more and more targeted. I think they need to advertise a little better, but I've been seeing changes. I honestly think it wont be long until they start rolling out targeted cuts of films where different people see different versions of content, at least in the first few weeks to see what reactions are like. They also have tried getting into the interactive film stuff, we'll see if that works out.

118,TV," I'm surprised that they are valued as high as they are, but I can make some counter arguments. First, if you're going to recommend a device to someone:

* shield is expensive and for enthusiasts. 

* chromecast without remote annoys many people. New one with remote is step in right direction.

* Apple TV is great if you want to drop money and possibly sucked into an ecosystem void. Also they just finally decided to fix the remote yesterday that everyone hates after what, 3-5 years?

* Fire TVs, for me, have just been a garbage platform advertising Amazon.

The built in smart tv? Well, I bought a top of the line Samsung KS series 4K HDR quantum dot tv (~$3K when new I think?). The Tizen OS is slow, and many apps don't get updated enough. Some apps don't add the latest features, and I believe (but not certain) that certain apps aren't even offered any more. Try explaining to people that they have a Tizen OS TV. I know Plex dropped support for Samsung Smart TVs a few years back that were one model year older than mine. The 'smart' in a smart TV comes with a lifespan that is seemingly shorter than the TV.

So I literally recommend Roku to most people. I use it myself on both my KS series TVs. It's smoother, more responsive, has all the features and services that my TV doesn't have. The roku has the most neutral platform with the simplest interface and use, you can't go wrong.

154,COIN," I mean yes, you have to do some mental gymnastics but they align.

My issue is more with how they're investing now. For example, let's look at PLTR. PLTR DPO's and sits around 9 dollars a share and ARK Invest does nothing. Sure PLTR is new to the market, but they're well established in the private market and I'm sure ARK knew about them and what they were about prior to listing.

Fast forward, PLTR pops and ARK dips it's toes in PLTR at 17 dollars a share. PLTR continues to pump and ARK starts to double down throughout. Recently it has been up and down and ARK has been buying the dip driving their current cost average up to 25 dollars a share.

Now I'm not knocking PLTR as a bad company, I'm not knocking ARK Invest for buying dips (that's how it's done)...what is really questionable to me is...if they're really so awesome at finding diamond companies, why did they choose to ignore PLTR at 9 dollars after the DPO, but as soon as it's pumped 200% they're going to make massive buys.

156,DKNG," I mean yes, you have to do some mental gymnastics but they align.

My issue is more with how they're investing now. For example, let's look at PLTR. PLTR DPO's and sits around 9 dollars a share and ARK Invest does nothing. Sure PLTR is new to the market, but they're well established in the private market and I'm sure ARK knew about them and what they were about prior to listing.

Fast forward, PLTR pops and ARK dips it's toes in PLTR at 17 dollars a share. PLTR continues to pump and ARK starts to double down throughout. Recently it has been up and down and ARK has been buying the dip driving their current cost average up to 25 dollars a share.

Now I'm not knocking PLTR as a bad company, I'm not knocking ARK Invest for buying dips (that's how it's done)...what is really questionable to me is...if they're really so awesome at finding diamond companies, why did they choose to ignore PLTR at 9 dollars after the DPO, but as soon as it's pumped 200% they're going to make massive buys. To me it just seems like they're chasing social media FOMO now.

Not the huge leg up, just that they are living in completely different world than finance professionals that the statistics represented, thus will have different statistical result, including being affected by all the biases you listed. I hardly see how GME and Tesla stock is argument for retail investor success when most lost money on these exact stocks. Either with wrong buy in prices or wrong option plays.

269,MO," Altria Group (MO) is the parent company of Phillip Morris USA, so yes, it's basically Phillip Morris, too.  It's just no longer part of the same company - they operate separately (some call them ""sister companies"").  Altria Group is also the parent of other companies apart from Phillip Morris USA, like U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Company which sells the popular brands Copenhagen and Skoal, as well as John Middleton, the producer of Black and Mild cigars.  They also own a wine company, and have partial equity in JUUL (vaping), Anheuser-Busch (beer), and Cronos (cannabis).   They also have a majority stake in a nicotine pouch company.  It's all [here](https://www.altria.com/about-altria/who-we-are?src=topnav) if you're curious to see it.

That's why they're called Altria *Group*, it's a group of companies, which just so happen to include Phillip Morris USA, the producer of Marlboro cigarettes (in the USA).

The reason the ticker is MO is because Altria group originated from a corporation called Philip Morris Industries, which included both the domestic and international Phillip Morris business.  They decided to rebrand from Phillip Morris, in part, to get away from the stigma of Big Tobacco and also to show that they do more than just produce cigarettes.  A smart move, seeing as how smoking is declining in the US.

I haven't looked at the numbers myself recently, but I would assume that the biggest source of revenue for Altria Group at present is still cigarette sales via Phillip Morris USA.

Phillip Morris International spun off in 2008.  They did this to prevent regulatory pressure in the USA from spilling over into emerging markets, where regulatory pressure is quite lax.  They focus entirely on tobacco, which includes cigarettes, but also their heat-not-burn product IQOS, which they claim will be the future (and are doing quite well with).",shortyafter,5,/r/stocks/comments/mv1dg6/big_tobacco_stocks_drop_after_biden/gvbav7k/,0.024,0.927,0.049,0.5493

273,BTI," You're most welcome!  I felt strongly about these picks and did a lot of research on them, I enjoy sharing what I've learned. My second biggest position is actually in MO precisely because they seem like they have a great future in cannabis, and they've also shown an ability and willingness to adapt to a changing market and changing regulations.  The fact that they're a well-established company with steady cash flows makes them a better pick than a start-up cannabis company, IMO. 

PM is not far behind for me, smoking in the developing world shows no signs of declining and their IQOS product is doing really well.  I invested slightly less because they're already very expensive... Altria looked like more bang for your buck.

I have small positions in the two of the other biggest tobacco companies, Imperial Brands and Japan Tobacco, but neither seem as innovative or reliable as PM or MO.

If you're interested in the cannabis play you could check out British American Tobacco (US ticker: BTI).  They recently put a big stake in Organigram, and they've also got global distribution including US.  It's the best worldwide tobacco play (MO and PM only catch US or international but not both), which in and of itself is awesome, and cannabis could really be a winner for them.

389,UK," Let's check out the numbers comparing it to one of the maddest gambling countries in the world: UK - a country where online betting is legalized and they gamble much more than other European countries. 

&#x200B;

 **47% of Brits** have gambled in some way in the last 4 weeks. 

 On average, Brits spend **£2.60 per week** on gambling, totaling over **£135.20 per year**. According to Businessfirstonline online gambling accounts for 38% of the total gambling market. However that is the total gambling market including casinos, sport betting etc. Exchanging the currency would result in 180$ per person and now the % results in around $68 per person.  In 2015 sports betting made 45% of all online gambling in the UK, so we now have around $30 per person. 

The US has around 320 million people. Multiple $30 with 320 and we get 9600 million spend in the US on Online Sportsbetting. 

Which would be 9.5 billion for the whole industry in sales. In the UK profit margins are:

William Hill 4.5% and Playtec is negative but has around 5% operating margins. These have several offline branches as well, so we say 12% is profit which is extremely generous. 

Taking the theoretical size of 9.5b of online sportsbetting and applying 12% (which is very generous) would result in around 1.14b in revenue. 

Average P/E ratio of InternetB2C betting sites was 15.6 according to Credit Suisse, that would result in an industry that should be around 16b for online sports betting. 

Draftkings is valued at 22b so in terms of online sports betting it is bigger than the theoretical industry of mad gambling Brits. So while the opportunity seems to be there, the price is already ahead of itself.",RoPrime12,2,/r/stocks/comments/mv63g1/any_thoughts_on_dkng/gvatpoh/,0.035,0.885,0.08,0.9421

393,DFS," I understand the argument but I'm not a fan of comparing the US and UK. They are very different betting markets. I think you can get an indicative figure just look at the early US revenue numbers. 

Last 6 months of 2020 has roughly $1.2B in revenue from the sports betting market. Even though Jan-Mar normally has strong revenue too, its a fair assumption the second half would have strong numbers than the first so conservatively we'll say that annual revenue right now for the market is $1.75-2B. That's with less than 30% of US residents having access to sports betting and less than 20% having access to full mobile wagering (which in a lot of states that have it accounts for roughly 80% of betting revenue). Based on this your revenue number of $9.5B doesn't look too far off but here's the thing, several of these states only legalized this past year and are going to see heavy immediate growth to their revenue numbers. Even in established states, revenue numbers are increasing at large rates:

Nevada that's been established for decades saw roughly a 15% revenue increase from 2018 Q4 to 2019 Q4 and over a 25% increase from 2019 Q4 to 2020 Q4.

New Jersey saw over a 50% increase from 2019 Q4 to 2020 Q4. 

Where the US revenue figure lands is anybody's best guess but I think $9.5B is incredibly modest. Also, more states are moving towards in-venue betting and some places (like FUBO) are working towards betting integration for live viewing (I'd expect books to follow that and DKNG has already worked a deal with Dish).

Also people keep labeling DraftKings as a ""US Only"" sports betting play. Canada is close to legalizing single game wagering and I feel very confident saying DKNG will be in the forefront of that market and will be an added boost to revenue.

Also, don't be shocked if DKNG expands beyond sports betting. There's still plenty of revenue opportunities available in:
- DFS
- igaming
- esports

I don't disagree with you that DKNG is aggressively priced but I do think there is some justification behind it. I still think the long term outlook for this company is very good and there is growth opportunity beyond current levels for people with a long term outlook.

That being said, it seems like only a matter of time before people start catching onto the broader implications and use cases for VR. People have started doing work meetings in VR, concerts and performances are starting to happen in VR, I've been doing my workouts in VR, my parents want to start doing in-VR movie nights with my brother and I since we all live apart from each other. I think that the public consensus is that VR is a ""gaming thing"" and it's not nearly as limited as that. But that will take time to overcome. We'll have to see with AR. I think it's kind of a crapshoot as to when/if it'll take off, especially since there's some significant hardware hurdles that have to be cleared, but I see a lot of these bigger companies (Amazon, Microsoft, Google, etc) hiring like CRAZY for their AR/VR R&D divisions, which tells me they're envisioning a big future for it.",tiptuppington,3,/r/stocks/comments/mvbyxu/rstocks_daily_discussion_wednesday_apr_21_2021/gvc7kje/,0.06,0.857,0.083,0.3408
533,GME," Honest question from someone that isn’t in GME at all but has loosely followed along with everything

There seem to be two common talking points on this sub that I see almost daily 

1) GME is extremely overvalued and the only people still in it are college kids and idiots that think it’s going to make them rich

2) Everyone overestimates the impact that retail has on the market and retail alone doesn’t really have an effect on share price

To me these two statements seem to be at odds with one another. GME has been on a slow decline for a while now, but it has also been above $100 for 2 straight months which to me (and most people on this sub) seems to be way too high. If most of the people still invested in GME are young/stupid retail investors but retail investors don’t have a real impact on the price of a stock then why hasn’t GME plummeted back to $20-$40/share?",ffthrowaway5,4,/r/stocks/comments/mvbyxu/rstocks_daily_discussion_wednesday_apr_21_2021/gvc72g1/,0.015,0.913,0.072,0.8658

537,GME, Just another interesting perspective. Right now you can make a mint selling covered calls on GME. I haven’t taken the plunge myself yet because I don’t trust that GME can actually keep its inflated value enough. But if you buy 100 shares today at $160 you can write a covered call for a month out for $200. If your shares get called away you make 20% on your investment and also collect a premium of a few grand since it’s so volatile. If your shares don’t get called you still made a few grand in like 2 months.

Long story short, they found a way to spend $550m on a worthless company that was that.

565,GE," I’d like to clear some confusion up that currently surrounds PLUG. The “shady shit” you’re referring to isn’t actually shady, it’s just been spun that was by people who don’t fully understand what they’re reading. 

First, the accounting error: 

Plug has been using KPMG as an independent auditor for 25 years. As a practice, independent auditors rotate the auditor that works with a company every 3-4 years. In Q4 2020 KPMG decided to rotate the auditor working with plug. This auditor that came in to audit the Q4 and Year end results found that he had a different interpretation of the SEC rules for how certain things were accounted for over the past 3 years. Upon consultation with all appropriate players to include Plug and KPMG it was agreed upon that the revelations of this auditor was the correct interpretation. This does not mean that Plug or anyone did anything wrong in the past, and KPMG as the independent auditor has blessed every quarterly and yearly report over this time period. Plug has been very clear that the revelations do not affect Plug's cash position or business relationships. The company recently stated that they are optimistic that the financials will be restated before their ER in early May. 

Second, CEO selling shares:

As for the CEO selling his shares: this was a pre-determined sale in accordance with SEC rule 10b5-1 trading plan. Essentially most executives of publicly traded companies have share sales built into their compensation packages. This sale was scheduled a long time ago, and therefore was not Andy participating in insider trading. He did not sell for any reason other than it was built into his contract to execute on that day. 

Also, there was definitely shady shit going on with plug and GE pre-2008, however Andy Marsh stepped in as CEO in 2008 and turned the company around. 

I hope that sheds light on some of the FUD that has been going around. Plug has a bright future as the leader in a disruptive industry. It seems like every week there is another new, major PR announcement about a partnership or new project developments. 

If you’re still concerned about the future of hydrogen because the infrastructure isn’t there. Well the big oil boys are going to take care of that for us! Shell and Toyota are now forming a plan to develop a hydrogen infrastructure in the US.  Europe and Asia have already begun developing their green hydrogen infrastructures. So the ducks are lining up nicely for plug to succeed.

572,GM," As others have stated, there are a lot of new companies in the eV space and a lot of old companies who can compete. Not everyone can survive. Some will need to fold. Question is who? Some randomish thoughts follow..

Tesla is likely ok but their valuation is lunacy. 

Rivian is probably going to be the 2nd biggest due to backing by Amazon and time frames. Their truck is almost here. SUV early next year I think. They also had a lot more time to develop and test so odds are, these guys will make it.

F will be ok because aside from legacy stuff, they own a chunk of Rivian which, ironically, might be worth more than their own company in time.

RIDE - Trashy CEO paid contractors to place pre-orders. Constantly makes lofty statement without basis like 1st truck to market or the 1st ""fleet"" truck. Both are statements are BS and add the fraud and I would avoid this. Its Nikola 2.0.

GM is throwing darts a board hoping to get lucky. 1st it was Nikola but that didnt pan out. Now they sort of have some connection to RIDE but look what those clowns did... GM is cursed (lol).

Canoo - Interesting. Solid engineering group. Pretty open about tech. Stock took a beating. I bought some this morning... should have bought more. Up about 10% already. But I am not trying to steer you, this is still highly speculative.

Lucid - Interesting. Solid team but the stupidest car coming to market... they are making a luxury sedan to compete against the Model S... which already doesnt sell well. /sigh

Volkswagen - Fallout from Emission fraud is still lingering. Basically bunch of liars and thieves who make cheap cars for the masses. Still, they are popular and they are all in on eV but their stock has already climbed a lot so probably not worth it.

Toyota - Late to the party but has eV hybrids. The RAV4 seems nice.

Fiat - Crappy company but I own a Crystler Pacifica PHEV... and its freaking awesome and basically cost $23k new after rebates and write offs (qualifies for Hummer writeoff lol). Never thought I could like a minivan... But anyway, they have some eV plays.  


Charging stations are problematic for a couple of reasons.

1 - They are cheap to make and install. Very simple tech. Its basically an electrical outlet with a meter... practically no barriers to entry.  
2 - Many charge far too much and they have to do that to be profitable. Problem is, most of the time, this makes them parity or even more expensive than octane... people wont go for that.

653,ALL," DCA wins every time. That and compounding interest is like never mentioned anymore lol.

You routinely contribute to a mixed and well diversified portfolio, every month, through thick and thin, through bulls and bears, through booms, bubbles, and crashes....and after 30 years....Holy shit you'll have a shit ton of shares and lots of zeros and commas.

Just from my own experience with accounts like my Roth and 401k. Once you break the infamous 100k mark, the numbers start climbing fast (compounding is such a beautiful thing to see).

And it takes ALL the emotion out of your analysis and any moves you make. I don't care what the price of a stock is on any given day, week, or even year. Idc. All I care about is how many shares I snagged up over 30 years of consistent buying. This is essentially how all retirement funds ""think"", because it's a 100% guarantee. The only time this doesn't work is if you are right at the cusp of retirement and a crash hits. But even then, you should be repositioning towards less risky investments and essentially have phased out of the stock market around those ages.

Like...if people invested monthly starting at 18...and invest until 55. That gives them an extra decade of buffer before they retire around 65, for them to move to much safer routes. That is almost 40 years of continuous investing. And you can bet you'll have seen some recessions/bubble crashes throughout all of it. Doesn't matter. That's 40 years of nonstop buying. Anywhere near the age of 55 and the market is ""green""....you'll easily be a millionaire/multiM. You don't have have be a whiz. Just consistent and dedicated.

Everyone should really treat their ""wealth management"" investments just like a retirement account. Be aggressive at younger ages, but don't tinker too much. Go growth stocks, sure. But keep contributing, regardless of momentum or swings.

Everyone really should ask themselves, ""am I here to make money or to grow wealth."" Neither answer is wrong. But where people get tripped up is when they say they want to grow wealth but employ a ""make money"" strategy that tries to capture momentums and swings and they totally miss the big picture.

For us (the small guy) the market will chew me up and spit me out. The market isn't for me to make fast money. It's a casino if you think of it that way. But as a little guy, it is definitely the best vehicle for me to grow wealth (along with other investment vehicles like Real Estate and appreciating physical property).

Jaime does it, worked with the guy for years, trusts him and Joe doesn't take orders from him. To my knowledge the only umbrella that Joe Rogan has over him is iTunes and then Spotify which are more so platforms than they are agencies. I'd compare spotify and itunes more to twitch and youtube than I would some talent agency.

>Ben Shapiro

Yeah but he owns the company that does it for him.

>You are kidding yourself if you think influencer marketing will be the first industry in modern capitalism is that isn't dominated by mega corporations.

As a splinter from the previous comments I'm pretty sure podcasting isn't dominated by major corporations and most of the large podcasters - Joe Rogan, Ben Shapiro, Howard Stern, all own their own IPs so that they are free to produce content that's entertaining and in their own best interest.

There was actually a very similar controversy over this exact thing back in May 2020, Call her Daddy, worked through a similar platform you're talking about (Barstool) to get big, however as soon as they did they got into a huge contract battle with Barstool over trying to gain control of their own IP.

>But if a streamer is a soloist who is going to line up all their business deals for them?

Generally its between the sponsor and content producer, if the content producer is big and profitable sponsors reach out to the content producer to advertise their content. But it has a very negative relationship with viewers because the second some streamer plays a mobile game for 40k an hour or talks about Raid: Shadow Legends for 2 minutes they lose about 80% of their viewers.

>Also, isn't it handy to have someone manage all of your social media ads, your website, your video editing, filming and comment moderation?

696,COIN," Because COIN has to prove they can make money consistently.  Just like Facebook when they IPO'd or any other company.

However, if crypto is traded regularly, then yeah, they will make the money and the stock will 10x like other exchange stocks like NASDAQ (NDAQ) or NYSE (ICE)

BUT if crypto isn't traded regularly, as in a crypto bear market for several years and no one wants to trade it, then COIN is going to probably plummet to 90% of it's current value:

Taking a look at the fundamentals of COIN a year ago, they earned way less:

* Rev growth q/q 495%
* EPS growth q/q 734%

While it's fantastic to know how much earnings growth coinbase has achieved, if they return to what they originally were earning, this stock is done for (but i'm hopeful).

Although another risk factor is if traditional exchanges allow for crypto trading, then why go to coinbase at all if you can just trade where you're familiar with.",provoko,2,/r/stocks/comments/mvo4uw/to_coin_or_not_to_coin_that_is_the_question/gvd5ml7/,0.03,0.824,0.146,0.9565
697,DD," Patience is your biggest asset as a retail trader.    

Generally speaking market timing strategies don't work, you're looking to sell things at a 25%+ loss, and then use DCA to time your way back into the market: But without the ability to predict the future you're just gambling that the market, does what? Goes down slowly over whatever your DCA period is? Otherwise, it is just a 25%+ loss with no real way for DCA to make up for it.  

My advice is:   

 - Do nothing.    
 - Set limits or alerts to auto-exit these positions at **break-even**, since you clearly have no DD/story/plan for the positions (likely months from now).    
 - Invest in low fee index funds since you are bored with actively managing stuff.    
 - Stop pretending you can predict the market. Stop trying to time the market. Stop making rash decisions with no plan or DD.",TimeRemove,23,/r/stocks/comments/mvfvoc/two_options_1_liquidate_everything_and_wait_for/gvbo6nh/,0.197,0.744,0.059,-0.969

751,NFLX," Sounds like a tomato, tomatoe problem, right?

You start with the ""Revenue"" part. That's your gross ""income"" level and you go down the books, accounting in your ""Costs of Revenue"", ie. what you need to spend, operating expenses which include payroll, marketing, costs of production, etc. and factor some other things like pesky taxes, depreciations and the like.

The *Revenue itself* usually is purely derived from *sales of products or services to whoever your business partners are (ie. B2B or B2C).* 

There are other kinds of income, like long term interest, leases billed etc. - *unless* leasing or renting out space is your main model of revenue. Think REITs. They only have Revenues derived from letting living/office space.

It's complicated until you arrive at the EBITDA line.

Once you have EBITDA, you factor in any write-offs (""Depreciatons"") and taxes (credits) etc. 

And then you're a certified accountant if you carried all the Zeroes properly and can show your Big Head Honcho (CEO) who usually is very interested in the ""net income"" part, ie. the margin.

Look at the NFLX finance sheet to see how it's accounted, from top (Revenue) to bottom (EBITDA and further down):

764,GME," Borrowing shares for shorting was not invented with GME.  It is literally how shorting works.  All legal short sales are selling borrowed shares.  If you do not borrow the shares you have a naked short and naked shorting is illegal.  This is how the market has worked for decades it is nothing new.  Borrowing the share does not reduce the risk of the short at all.  The risk of the short is that the stock goes up and if it goes up too much they can be margin called because the cost to maintain the proper margin balance also goes up with the price of the shorted shares.

Shorting is not slowing societal progress or murdering it.  It is people betting that a bunch of stocks are going to go down and possibly to zero but it doesn't actually cause the company itself to fail.

The only new thing is that new people jumped on the hype train and are listening to a bunch of conspiracy theories and don't understand how the market works.",imnotgood42,18,/r/stocks/comments/mviz96/share_borrowing_is_getting_paid_to_destroy_the/gvc9e5l/,0.086,0.849,0.065,-0.8721

771,ALL," You are giving a blanket statement to address short selling, but have assumed the account is a MARGIN account. Majority of passive investors are not investing through a margin account, and don’t even understand shorting. I think the general thought, is that ALL accounts hold the securities as derivatives, and regardless if it’s a margin account those derivatives may not contain the underlying stock. Understood that margin accounts lend often and that is OK. THAT makes sense because it could also be seen a a hedge by the broker against the chance of the security tanking and recouping the cost of the ‘loan’. 

The discussion is on short selling securities where the holder has 100% ownership.

Maybe they put it in the fine print that it’s “ok”, but the OP and the discussion is surrounding the thought that the securities should be physically in the brokers possession, but they have elected to hold derivatives in lieu of the physical security. You’ve only addressed a small portion of what the OP is trying to get at, I think. How would you address brokers lending the shares out in quantities HIGHER than would be reasonable to hedge against margin positions their customers hold?

Edit seeing as you continually mention that is common practice for margin accounts. A quick google search can show you the difference.

“The two main types of brokerage accounts are cash accounts and margin accounts. Cash account requires that all transactions must be made with available cash or long positions. Margin accounts allow investors to borrow money against the value of the securities in their account.”

Typically, cash accounts are what is used by retail when taking long positions. Margin accounts are usually used when trading options, or when operating as a business. Obviously not limited to those points - but I suggest you research it",relishburger,0,/r/stocks/comments/mviz96/share_borrowing_is_getting_paid_to_destroy_the/gvcu7lj/,0.0,0.874,0.126,0.9883
