You should be able to sell to open at least 5 contracts at 18 strike and get around $450-500 in premiums now in order to wait until after this Friday to see if it panned out. Theoretically, if PLTR decides to rally you could chase it on the way up each week and keep pocketing chunky premiums. If it never hits your strike, you would be lowering your cost basis on the 3600 shares you already have now. Also, sell Covered Calls on your 3600 and get around $470 or more each week at the $24 strike to also lower your basis while you're waiting for the moon-shot.",Saaan,10,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n9jqdc/me_holding_pltr_rn/gxp9f8j/,0.073,0.855,0.071,0.4019

175,GME," > GameStop themselves confirmed they are heavily shorted

No they didn't.  They stated there **was** a short squeeze in the past.  They did not make any statements about their current situation.     If you disagree post the link to the quote from GME.   Also GME has **no idea** about the number of shares that are short (SI%) - they literally have no way of knowing this information other than the FINRA published data which GME holders say is false.

>almost every day shows a 5:1 buy to sell ratio

This type of trade analysis makes no sense.  There is a buyer and seller for every share of stock traded.   People keep repeating this stuff without a basic understanding of what the numbers they are looking at means.

> How could they have covered millions upon millions of shares whilst simultaneously driving the price down?

You don't have to short sell a stock for the price to go down.   The price is set by the current buyers and sellers.    If no one is willing to buy at $140 and then next buyer is at $135, then the bid drops to $135 - no shares had to change hands.

So many people act like it takes a certain level of volume to drive a stock price up or down - that isn't how price discovery works.   A stock price is based on the last trade.     The price can drop without any short selling, it can simply be people who are long trying to sell their shares and accepting the current bid price.

489,LDI," You guys realize the share-price, and the public float means that the 100-110 million shares of public float times the share price comes to 660-726 million dollars if the share-price is 6.6. Which means, all else being equal, if the share price remained neutral that means they could buy up 41.3 to 45 of the Class A float. You know, the shares on the market.

Considering the dividend yield is almost 6.2% at 6.47, and they have 1.5 Billion in Senior Notes (800 million was issued on April 16 so it doesn't show on the balance sheet for this quarter) with a 5.5% dividend yield it makes perfect sense to do a share buy back as opposed to an early redemption of notes and they get more bang for buck. Furthermore, they get a Earnings Per Share Boost by doing this. This helps the top and the bottom line in short. This also boosts the mortgage servicing income, as well as the interest income they receive, tallies more than the dividend yield and the interest income on the 1.5B notes I'm bullish on their ability to sustain the dividend.

The Earnings Report was a decidedly mixed bag, and there's no two ways about it. Here are some of my thoughts that are additional:

1. The 49.1B in origination was a whiff, as they guided for 52-57B in originations. Gain on sale fell right in the middle-ish which was fine. I was right to guide for a little less or roughly 1B in net income, and if the salaries, commissions, and benefits hadn't increased exponentially 123,624 million they would have met right around 1B at 983,624,000.
2. I like they are guiding up as opposed to everyone else for Q2, and considering their miss for Q1 I feel they may even be being conservative so as to not disappoint again. One thing I didn't like was that their gain on sale margin was expected to be .75%-1.1% for Q2, but one part of that may be that they have an in-house jumbo program where they retain servicing which might compress margin. With that said, there is definitely a pricing war going on, and as the CEO of LDI said we don't know when that'll end but as he stated no one likes to sell something for ninety cents on the dollar, and we can expect higher margins when the pricing war cools. Please note RKT's wholesale margin is expected to be 1%.
3. I like that they are investing in "" Continued investment into machine learning and Robotic Process Automation (RPA) to further advance our operational excellence while driving down costs."" Margin expansion is key, especially since they already have a margin advantage.
4. I like that they have ""Continued to invest in our technology platform and on-site teams resulting in additional operational efficiencies focused on reducing costs, reducing closing times, and increasing loan processing speed"" since, again, margin advantage. I also like reduced closing and loan processing speeds.
5. I like that:  ""Our continued investments in the cloud, as well as technologies that increase Underwriting efficiency, such as Automated Document Recognition and Optical Character Recognition, have strengthened our technology advantage while driving greater efficiency, and reducing both fixed and variable costs."" Ditto with everything else.
6. Their jumbo and government portion of both refinance and purchase are extremely low relative to Q1 2020 because they only turned the spigot back on them the latter part of March. This is probably why it's so low, and why they are guiding up. Remember the gain on sale margin for government loans are smaller than conventional though so that might help explain some of the margin compression. This should also help them Q3 and Q4.
7. The seasonally adjusted annual homebuilding rate is at over 1.7 million home as April. There is a 4 million home backlog, and to keep up with demand home builders need to build 1.2 million homes a year. It needs to be more than 1.2 million to start reducing the backlog.
8. RKT's share price was roughly 20 dollars when it announced its 1 billion dollar buyback and had a market cap of 40 billion at the time. UWMC's market cap is roughly 10.8B. So it's market cap is exactly 27% what RKT's was at the time of the buyback. But the share buyback is 30% of RKT's. So there is more bang for buck. Additionally, there was a 1.1B special dividend of 1.1B which equated to roughly 5.5% at 20 dollars. The current annual yield on UWMC is over 6%. What's more, doing share buyback will increase EPS, net income, cash flow, and the balance sheet as opposed to RKT where it will only help EPS. Therefore, there is strong upside to be had at this price point.
9. I like that their highest expense (employees) is variable and stands at above 2/3rds of their expenses since it's easy to downsize in times of hardship, or they can choose to maintain staffing levels but not replace people to leave for a natural deceleration of income.
10. I'm revising my expectations of 2-2.5 Billion dollars a year in net income to roughly 1.5-2.25 Billion, and I am being very conservative on the low end. I am calculating roughly 500 million in net income for Q2 2021 to be somewhat conservative. The way I am coming to that conclusion is by calculating a 49.1B origination for Q2 even though they are guiding for 51-55B (and considering the embarrassment of the whiff, and the new products they have on offer to increase capacity, I believe them to be conservative). I am also assuming a 75 basis point margin on gain on sale which is a touch more than 34% of the margin for Q1 2021. Under these presumptions  they would be making 368,035,000 in loan production income. I am going to flat out live in delusion land and assume that Mortgage Servicing Income remains the same at 115,205,000 after accounting for the fact that mortgage servicing income minus change in fair value, plus gain on sale, and interest income equals that. That totals revenue of 483,240,000. I am going to assume the absolute worst and assume that they don't compress their expenses whatsoever and so their expenses will tally  317,000,000. Thus their net income will be 166,240,000.

I won't place the income tax because:  ""UWMC's net income for periods prior to the first quarter of 2021 does not reflect an income tax provision, since UWM (UWMC's accounting predecessor) is a pass-through entity not subject to federal and most state income taxes. For periods commencing with the first quarter of 2021, UWMC's net income does not reflect the income tax provision that would otherwise be reflected if 100% of the economic interest in UWM was owned by UWMC. Therefore, for comparison purposes, UWMC provides “Adjusted net income”, which is our pre-tax income adjusted for a 23.78% estimated effective tax rate. “Adjusted net income” is a Non-GAAP Metric.""

If one looks at the net income attributable to UWMC on the cash flow statement and then divides by the provision for income taxes, then that is an effective tax rate of 26.8% for roughly 5.7% of the float which is roughly the 6 percent of free float. What I am trying to say is that we only pay net income on the 6% of free float that is the Class A public float. The adjusted net income would be if the entirety of the company was taxed, which it isn't, so disregard adjusted net income as it's not GAAP. We'll assume a 25 percent haircut to income tax as a result (though it would be a higher haircut, I'm just lazy) which would give taxes of 9,664.

After accounting for federal and state taxes, the new net income would be 166,230,336. Net income and thus EPS is pre dividend income, but let's count the dividend before EPS and count it as part of net income for a truly catastrophic scenario. So, let's assume no share buybacks occurred (worst case scenario), we'd then remove 10,310,420.5 (.10\* 103,104,205). The new net income after accounting for dividends is 155,919,916. Please note that in accounting you don't calculate the net income by putting the dividend as a expense. I'm just doing this to give you guys an absolute shit tier scenario with revenue misses, no mortgage servicing rights increases and thus no mortgage servicing income and interest increases, no margin gain, expenses that do not decrease, a bit more tax than they'd actually pay, no shares bought back, and dividends as an expense and thus weigh down on net income and thus EPS. I did not count the interest expense on the new 700 million senior notes however. But it should come to roughly 31 million.

The EPS would be .097, so round it to ten cents. Account for the same EPS for Q3 and Q4. You get 30 cents. This is 30 cents without the dividend payout ratio since the dividend is already accounted for. We'll not include Q1. The dividend of 40 cents alone will net you a p/e ratio of 16.175. The actual EPS for you as a class A shareholder would be 70 cents for the period Q2 to Q4. That would translate to a P/E ratio of 9.24. If you count the EPS of Q1 (which is Earnings per share of .47) then the FY 2021 EPS would be .70 and the P/E ratio would be 8.64. But if you count the dividend of .40 in addition to the EPS then it becomes 1.17 and the P/E ratio becomes 5.52. The only reason I count the dividend is because the dividend payout ratio is literally .006 (.10\*.06=.006) per quarter. However, you're still getting ten cents a quarter on a stock that is 6.47 while retaining your economic interest in the company itself which is adding roughly 77 cents in EPS FY 2021 under a catastrophic failure of epic proportions scenario.",Hani95,13,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n9hsma/uwmc_earnings_update_good_news_shitty_news_and/gxpkb06/,0.046,0.83,0.124,0.9992
490,RKT," You guys realize the share-price, and the public float means that the 100-110 million shares of public float times the share price comes to 660-726 million dollars if the share-price is 6.6. Which means, all else being equal, if the share price remained neutral that means they could buy up 41.3 to 45 of the Class A float. You know, the shares on the market.

Considering the dividend yield is almost 6.2% at 6.47, and they have 1.5 Billion in Senior Notes (800 million was issued on April 16 so it doesn't show on the balance sheet for this quarter) with a 5.5% dividend yield it makes perfect sense to do a share buy back as opposed to an early redemption of notes and they get more bang for buck. Furthermore, they get a Earnings Per Share Boost by doing this. This helps the top and the bottom line in short. This also boosts the mortgage servicing income, as well as the interest income they receive, tallies more than the dividend yield and the interest income on the 1.5B notes I'm bullish on their ability to sustain the dividend.

The Earnings Report was a decidedly mixed bag, and there's no two ways about it. Here are some of my thoughts that are additional:

1. The 49.1B in origination was a whiff, as they guided for 52-57B in originations. Gain on sale fell right in the middle-ish which was fine. I was right to guide for a little less or roughly 1B in net income, and if the salaries, commissions, and benefits hadn't increased exponentially 123,624 million they would have met right around 1B at 983,624,000.
2. I like they are guiding up as opposed to everyone else for Q2, and considering their miss for Q1 I feel they may even be being conservative so as to not disappoint again. One thing I didn't like was that their gain on sale margin was expected to be .75%-1.1% for Q2, but one part of that may be that they have an in-house jumbo program where they retain servicing which might compress margin. With that said, there is definitely a pricing war going on, and as the CEO of LDI said we don't know when that'll end but as he stated no one likes to sell something for ninety cents on the dollar, and we can expect higher margins when the pricing war cools. Please note RKT's wholesale margin is expected to be 1%.
3. I like that they are investing in "" Continued investment into machine learning and Robotic Process Automation (RPA) to further advance our operational excellence while driving down costs."" Margin expansion is key, especially since they already have a margin advantage.
4. I like that they have ""Continued to invest in our technology platform and on-site teams resulting in additional operational efficiencies focused on reducing costs, reducing closing times, and increasing loan processing speed"" since, again, margin advantage. I also like reduced closing and loan processing speeds.
5. I like that:  ""Our continued investments in the cloud, as well as technologies that increase Underwriting efficiency, such as Automated Document Recognition and Optical Character Recognition, have strengthened our technology advantage while driving greater efficiency, and reducing both fixed and variable costs."" Ditto with everything else.
6. Their jumbo and government portion of both refinance and purchase are extremely low relative to Q1 2020 because they only turned the spigot back on them the latter part of March. This is probably why it's so low, and why they are guiding up. Remember the gain on sale margin for government loans are smaller than conventional though so that might help explain some of the margin compression. This should also help them Q3 and Q4.
7. The seasonally adjusted annual homebuilding rate is at over 1.7 million home as April. There is a 4 million home backlog, and to keep up with demand home builders need to build 1.2 million homes a year. It needs to be more than 1.2 million to start reducing the backlog.
8. RKT's share price was roughly 20 dollars when it announced its 1 billion dollar buyback and had a market cap of 40 billion at the time. UWMC's market cap is roughly 10.8B. So it's market cap is exactly 27% what RKT's was at the time of the buyback. But the share buyback is 30% of RKT's. So there is more bang for buck. Additionally, there was a 1.1B special dividend of 1.1B which equated to roughly 5.5% at 20 dollars. The current annual yield on UWMC is over 6%. What's more, doing share buyback will increase EPS, net income, cash flow, and the balance sheet as opposed to RKT where it will only help EPS. Therefore, there is strong upside to be had at this price point.
9. I like that their highest expense (employees) is variable and stands at above 2/3rds of their expenses since it's easy to downsize in times of hardship, or they can choose to maintain staffing levels but not replace people to leave for a natural deceleration of income.
10. I'm revising my expectations of 2-2.5 Billion dollars a year in net income to roughly 1.5-2.25 Billion, and I am being very conservative on the low end. I am calculating roughly 500 million in net income for Q2 2021 to be somewhat conservative. The way I am coming to that conclusion is by calculating a 49.1B origination for Q2 even though they are guiding for 51-55B (and considering the embarrassment of the whiff, and the new products they have on offer to increase capacity, I believe them to be conservative). I am also assuming a 75 basis point margin on gain on sale which is a touch more than 34% of the margin for Q1 2021. Under these presumptions  they would be making 368,035,000 in loan production income.

**Buyback Class D Conversion ($7 / share)**: 1,459,212,644 (Class D left); 103,104,205 (Class A left) = \~6.6% float

**Buyback Current Float ($7 / share)**: 1,502,069,787 (Class D left); 60,247,062 (Class A left) = \~3.8% float

Yes we get the idea. But the idea that all of these short positions haven't covered is a stretch. Maybe the GME crowd is right and it is one big conspiracy rigging the numbers and lying and all the hedge funds are secretly sitting on these shorts still and just paying the fees and costs, long over their covering deadlines. But that isnt likely. What is more likely is a large number was sold off early and the short laddering since is exactly what it seemed like. And every day they offload a little more of what they have left.

The money they would have to pay to still be holding shorts on positions they had deadlines on 4 months ago would be adding up massively at this point.

Dont get me wrong, I am holding 40 shares of GME just in case. But I think most of the shorts are gone.

Even the current short float is misleading. People shorted the stock when it was at 150+ since the first time it broke it because it was a fantastic play.

They shorted once when it was $4, the huge $480 rally wasn't a a margin call that squeeze them, confirmed by the last SEC congressional hearing rightbout of the SEC's mouth. Means the $4 shorts drove up the price to 480 (plus retail bandwagon) to cover. Because they had to cover at 20-40 dollars (4-10x their initial short). Then they doubled down in February.

It's a lose lose for them. 1) cover, lose money 3-10x their initial investment, and put in their SEC filing they lose money, which would have retail gather around GME again, or 2) extend, lose money on interest, drive prices and try to buy back where they can. That SEC noose is closing in around them.

&#x200B;

I've been following for 6 months and know as much as I will tel you.

Debt shouldn't worry you. 2/3rds of debt are on hand. Meaning, 1.5 billion is owed but has 1 billion in cash.

Dilution... Had 70 million left from 2013... Half (1/3rd) have been issued (17 million) and in the 6 days we saw the stock drop .90 cents about and all the shares were bought up. Id assume another dilution of remaining once it hits 14-15. cash is the name of the game.

AMC is making moves to cut debt and expand. The bought out osedion (Something like that) or another movie company.

&#x200B;

Pandemic is opening back up and people are buying AMC gift cards and seeing movies like no other because of what GME/AMC started... Remember... The two MOST shorted stocks were...

GM3

and

A /\\/\\ C

GM3 was 140% when this started

A /\\/\\ C was 85% when it started.

&#x200B;

These two stocks were the start of this whole crazy bull/Ape market.

GME sky rocketed and they screwed a lot of people over putting life savings into it. This is where AMC comes into play. People missed out on GME and brokers screwed others. Everyone who couldn't afford GME or didn't trust it to stay this high put money into AMC and held it like it was a New Born baby.

AMC Apes have done the same DD, same Memes, and had the same manipulation/issue. AMC and GME were shorted by the same companies. Who.. Idk. Prob Citadel and Melvin.

&#x200B;

So... I can tell you from my history in AMC that we are going to roll this stock harder than a rock.

I don't want to keep typing. So ask me anything. What are your concerns. Ill see if I can answer them for you and provide proof and sources if it helps.

Every Ape matters. Meaning, you matter. Im not asking you to sell your GME shares to buy AMC. I am asking for you to spread the word about AMC. If I can convince you, maybe you will convince another ape.

I am so confident in this... Just not confident in the SEC/Market/ What comes next because they(Gov. Hedges, billionaires.. etc... WANT TO KEEP US POOR). I can guarantee a squeeze...YES (No guarantees and not a financial guy, just my opinion) How high this will go depends on a lot of factors.

Based on the SEC preparing for a new market maker... Id say, its going pretty high.

From the end of 2019 (I use end because that's when investors had the best idea of the 2019 AMC financaials) to today AMC got a 505% (164% if we use the absolute high in 2019) increase in its market capitalization and you are telling me that the profits in 2023 will be similar to that period???

668,UE," To my knowledge, even though Trump reinstated coal mining in the US, coal’s investments did not followed. The main reason was that coal project need years to be planned and executed which is opposed to the increasing turn to green energy.  

As for the global picture, the UE recovery plan aims to sanctuarise up to 30% of the funds to green energy. Gas energy is also going to ramp up dramatically in the East of Europe with the rise of Russian importations to Germany, which aims to be a gas distributor across the East (if Nord Stream 2 is completed, we’re talking about billions of metric cubes each year, way over the annual Germany’s gas consumption). To me, it appeals for a change in energy sources in Poland and other East europeans countries. 

As for China, the Party is committing itself to ramp up green investments, in order to purify the major cities and to be n1 in green energy provider (which it already is in air and solar).

673,PTC," > It's the hundreds of billions in a variety of corporate welfare programs and cronyism

Agreed. Oil companies get [way too much in subsidies](https://www.eesi.org/papers/view/fact-sheet-fossil-fuel-subsidies-a-closer-look-at-tax-breaks-and-societal-costs). I'd also argue that ""renewable energy companies"" is an increasingly nebulous term, as traditional electric utilities are embracing renewable energy for the low cost and environmental impact. Most solar and wind companies are viable without the ITC and PTC, anyway.

>Did you know that with a complete conversion to EVs alone, we'd need 3x times the electricity of our current demand? 

Even if that's true (which I don't believe it is), did you know that our electric demand also increased sharply with the invention and mass adoption of air conditioning? Our power grid was able to adapt, and we are currently seeing the beginning of an adaptation for mass electrification (of heating, of transportation, of cooking, etc).

Imagine thinking that large-scale EV adoption would lead to no more road lights or air conditioning in all of California.

680,TWO," LOL! Yes. 2x-3x the power requirement for EV vehicles across the board. Our grid has been deteriorating for decades. There is ZERO comparison between the impact on our grid in the 60s (A/C) and what EVs would cause now. California can't even keep the lights on as it is during the summer -- not to mention that they routinely buy energy from other states. They've been having intermittent rolling blackouts for TWO DECADES, and they STILL haven't bothered doing anything about it. Only an ignorant fool thinks they could plug-in 15 million cars... and buses... and trucks... and heavy machinery... and whatever I'm leaving out, without any impact on their failing electric grid. You grossly, grossly underestimate the amount of additional power involved.

757,UWMC," The Gain on Sale Margins are what's going to drive the stock price in the short/medium term. Mortgage Originators are coming off a great year in 2020 (volume/originations for the industry went up to about $4 trillion and Gain on Sale Margins went up to record highs). Somewhere between $3.0 -$3.5 trillion is the expectation for volume in 2021, but GoS margins are the big unknown. They've dropped significantly already, but the question is what direction they are headed now.

I think Matt/UWMC can produce a ton of volume and gain market share, but the question is how much revenue will that volume generate? Producing $1 billion of mortgages at 200 bps of GoS Margin yields $20 million of revenue. Producing $1 billion of mortgages at 100 bps yields $10 million of revenue. The expense base probably isn't going to change that much relative to the volume and the Servicing segment should do better with higher interest rates, but the GoS Margin is the big unknown.

UWMC has the potential to be a big winner in the long-term, but there are some significant short-term headwinds. I don't have any position in UWMC btw.",throughatube,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n9xrrg/is_the_market_right_about_uwmc/gxr1txo/,0.0,0.858,0.142,0.9828

817,RKT," I don't think you can read into these numbers the way you are. For one, RKT's partner network isn't just mortgage broker originations. Only the specific RKT TPO platform is mortgage broker originations.

In contrast, RKT's partner network volume, as they report it, is essentially all mortgage volume they get that are not direct to consumer. They lump it all together. This includes real estate agent partner network, the broker RKT TPO platform, and other ""partners.""

As far as I'm aware, Rocket does not breakdown it's partner network volume in its SEC filings so it's unclear what its exact broker volume is.

At a minimum though, the Rocket partner volume is comprised of more than just it's broker channel. Specifically, [this March 8, 2021 article](https://www.housingwire.com/articles/rocket-pro-tpo-finally-reveals-broker-origination-volume/) says Rocket finally disclosed its 2020 mortgage broker volume as $97 billion. In contrast, Rocket's recent annual 10-k indicates its 2020 partner network loan volume was $106 billion. Thus, the partner network loan volume has to include more than just the broker volume.

The Q4 2020 $37.9 billion and Q1 2021 $40.7 billion partner network loan volumes are only a 7.5% difference. I don't think you can read into how successful or unsuccessful UWMC's ultimatum is from just those numbers.

Also, presumably, even if UWMS's ultimatum were successful, it would have driven a short term mortgage broker spike to Rocket. That is, UWMC issues the ultimatum, all the brokers realize they're going to have to choose one, so they all test out both UWMC and Rocket to see which is the preferable platform. However, that doesn't mean that short term spike will be a long term one. I think only this upcoming quarter will tell how successful it was.

Lastly, from an economics perspective, as long as UWMC is able to give its customers lower rates, it'd be pretty weird for it to lose market share to Rocket. It would mean brokers aren't doing their jobs and taking their clients to the lowest rate lender.

I haven't seen anything in these recent quarterly releases indicating averaging interest rates for Rocket and UWMC, but last quarter I believe UWMC's average rate was something like 0.5% less than Rocket's, a pretty significant difference when you're dealing with 3% interest rates.",JuanPabloElTres,14,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n9i0sf/rkt_is_eating_into_uwmcs_market_share/gxol0pd/,0.026,0.904,0.069,0.9563

822,RKT," I see it as the opposite. RKT guided down for the next quarter, UWMC guided up.

RKT does 4x the volume of UWMC, but their big claim to fame is an iPhone app. UWMC has a dramatically lower close time (17 days on average vs 40-50 for RKT), averages lower interest rates, and a lower default rate (meaning they are cherry picking higher quality candidates)

The above factors are very important in a competitive environment, especially since customers at the broker level will be much more likely to use UWMC simply due to the fast closing times, not to mention the obvious benefits to the customer lower rates mean.

A house is a big purchase, RKT might have a more intuitive and convenient application interface, but I don’t see that holding a lot of sway long term since you can save a few hundred bucks a month in interest and close much faster by choosing UWMC.

UWMC is sitting on a shitload of cash, is investing in growth, and I can see them growing just as fast if not faster than RKT, they’re definately primed for the current environment and going forward have every advantage over RKT.

833,LDI," Some very important context relevant to this that was revealed in the UWMC conference call this morning:

Ishbia stated that because of how quickly UWMC can close and service loans, the effect of the interest rate increase in March was actually felt and impacted their Q1 results, since loans started in March were already closed and on the books by the end of Q1. In contrast, other lenders that have longer loan closing times may not actually show the full impact of the March interest rate increase since the loan applications from March may not have been closed by the end of Q1, but rather the decreased loans from March will show in their Q2 results. For many of these companies with longer time to close a loan, Q1 results may only show loans that were started from December-Februrary, and thus their Q1 results may look better than UWMC. 

But it will bite them in their Q2 results. This is why companies like LDI and RKT have reduced their guidance for Q2, because that is when the reduction in loans from March will be added to their books.

Ishbia stated that because of how quickly UWMC can close and service loans, the effect of the interest rate increase in March was actually felt and impacted their Q1 results, since loans started in March were already closed and on the books by the end of Q1. In contrast, other lenders that have longer loan closing times may not actually show the full impact of the March interest rate increase since the loan applications from March may not have been closed by the end of Q1, but rather the decreased loans from March will show in their Q2 results. For many of these companies with longer time to close a loan, Q1 results may only show loans that were started from December-Februrary, and thus their Q1 results may look better than UWMC. 

But it will bite them in their Q2 results. This is why companies like LDI and RKT have reduced their guidance for Q2, because that is when the reduction in loans from March will be added to their books. In contrast, Ishbia strongly reiterated during the conference call that Q2 will be even better than Q1, and is probably one of the few mortgage companies that is guiding higher for Q2 than Q1.",Kendalf,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n9i0sf/rkt_is_eating_into_uwmcs_market_share/gxr3ycz/,0.0,0.904,0.096,0.9609

846,RKT," I took a look at RKT on TD & I think I figured it out. Some websites are including minority interest in liabilities & some are not.

Assets- $34,732,277,000 minus Liabilities - $26,426,448,000 = $8,305,829,000 Book Value

Divide Book Value by the total outstanding shares of 1,984,454,000, which gets you to a book value per share of 4.19.

Share price of $16.83 divided by $4.19 book value her share is a P/B around 4.

However... Dan Gilbert/etc. own 94% of the company, so TD appears to be taking 94% of the book value & putting it on the liability line as minority interest, which is correct per GAAP.

94% of $8,305,829,000 Book Value  = $7,750,000,000 Minority Interest

Then if you reduce the book value by the minority interest & you do all the calculations again you get a P/B of 60.

I'm no expert by any means, but it doesn't seem to make sense to include minority interest in calculating P/B. TD's P/B calculation is including every outstanding share in the company, including Dan Gilberts, not just the float.

So why would you reduce book value by the 94% minority interest, but then use EVERY outstanding share including those owned by the minority interest in the P/B calculation?

submission or execution, either by IBKR or by the market. Filters may also result in an order being cancelled or rejected. IBKR may also cap the price or size of Client's orders before they are

Also, it is based on a false sense of group think based on morals rather than greed. Don’t fool yourself. If this is to work, and WSB did NOT work prior to GME, we need to get back to what made GME work in the first place. There will not be another GME. I was in GME from August 2020. Pounded stocktwits boards, well before you probably were even aware of it. The po in t is this. The whole success of WSB my friend, is based on value investing inspired by Michael Burry. It’s morphed into something that is ultimately going to hurt us, not help us, as we naively believe we will all pile in some bloated meme stock that is NOT a GME, because we all believe we are here to beat institutions and quants and prove a “moral” point. However, you’re confusing a market that allowed these high growth, no revenue stocks to thrive.. soon, it will end, it already is... the liquidity is drying up to pump into high growth no rev stocks, but us retail will still blindly pour in, lose more and more money, while those stocks that abide by what made GME a deep value will be the ones that ultimately bring returns. If you can’t see this, see GME for what it was, how it started, in the context it did, I wish you the best. Ultimately, a hedge fund, a big institution, or WSB isn’t going to determine where a stock trades. Fundamentals and mean reversion will.

The only way to fix it would be seen as extremely harsh and cruel.  As in, ""you either go out and do something to support yourself, or you starve"" harsh and cruel.  It all starts with allowing people/institutions to fail instead of propping them up indefinitely.  I would eliminate almost all corporate subsidies/bailouts; if you aren't profitable get fucked, you deserve to go bankrupt.  Then I'd reduce unemployment benefits to below minimum wage (if they aren't there's no motivation to work), and then start agressively slashing government budgets.  There's no reason for half of the government jobs to even exist, and the government is just a bloated, slow, money sucking monstrosity (just look at their budgets relative to GDP over the last 100 years, it's disgusting how large we've let the government get) that is WAY too involved in every aspect of our life.",poorlyimplemented,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n9nzkc/see_the_light_that_burry_has_shown_us/gxqk0l8/,0.172,0.724,0.104,-0.9409

1185,AMC," The “institutional investors” are passive funds so using them as a bull case doesn’t make any sense. As more people buy the fund itself- the more the fund buys. 

Movies are not dead, i agree. Let’s just say that people do go back to move theaters at pre pandemic levels. (cause the whole “lots of people like this stock so they will go to movies more” argument is comically stupid). AMC is trading at 500% the market cap it was at pre pandemic. 

The AMC ceo said he does not expect profit levels of 2019 until at least 2023. At the end of 2019 AMC had a market cap of 780M it has a market cap of 4.52B right now. 

AMC got almost 360M attendance per year in 2017-2019 and pulled a loss 2 of those 3 years. If you think there are enough investors in AMC to make a dent in this number you are delusional. 

In order to JUSTIFY current price point, movies need to be a LOT more than just “not dead” they need to come back at multiples, 2-3 times as hard in theaters as before to justify the CURRENT PRICE.
