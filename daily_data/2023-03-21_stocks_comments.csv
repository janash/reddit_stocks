0,AI," I’m heavily invested in big tech, but I’d be a proponent of breaking them up. Right now we have a constant stream of news threatening some kind of action and the big players all being extraordinarily cautious with everything they do, to keep public opinion positive. Just do it and rip the bandaid off. You see this with google and AI, you see this with Facebook and anything to do with privacy (it doesn’t look like it from the outside, but facebooks internal privacy review loves to stop anything before it gets going)

What I don’t want is a series of regulations to hamstring these companies. I have the same feeling toward banks. Break up the banks so one failing doesn’t bring down the financial system.

2,TV," > I’m heavily invested in big tech, but I’d be a proponent of breaking them up. 

Which makes sense if investment in them.  As a company like Google broken up is worth a lot more money than one entity.

I totally agree that it would remove the overhang of this kind of constant news.  That is only going to get worse.

The thing people do not understand is how much user experience would be worse if they broken them up.

Take YouTube.   The first thing an independent YouTube would do is end the blocking of ads.   Google has always had the ability to do that.   YouTube TV for example you can NOT block ads.    

But I totally agree on your post that the constant threats is not good for share price.

BTW, breaking up would not change anything.   We still will have concentration.   That is human nature and the Internet on why that is the way today and not going to change.",bartturner,-4,/r/stocks/comments/11xfwwa/washington_prepares_for_war_with_amazon_on/jd418l0/,0.153,0.747,0.1,-0.9022
3,GM," For example, Sears itself was slowly lumbering towards a slow death, but did successfully spin off Coldwell Banker, Discover Bank, Allstate Insurance, Dean Witter (a stock brokerage that later combined with Morgan Stanley), and a bunch of other assets.

Out of the GM bankruptcy, Ally Bank (formerly GMAC) was one of the more valuable businesses to emerge.

Breaking up big bloated companies can sometimes be helpful at creating value. Often big companies are too risk averse to want to pursue things that might challenge their existing dominance in a field (Kodak's invention of the digital camera and abandoning it, Canon/Nikon being slow to adopt mirrorless, Sony sabotaging its cell phone division to not step on its camera division, etc.).

I am old and worked at Contel during the Judge Greene Agreement.  So know it well and suspect a lot better than oneself.  I lived it.

It is NOT anything like this and makes no sense to use as an example.   

On every single computer someone CHOOSES to use Google they could have used something else.    That was NOT the case with the phone.   Completely different situation.

78,FT," [Bearish trends in lithium](https://www.mining.com/web/lithium-prices-in-china-halve-in-just-four-months/).

I've wrote about this before [(see thread here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1055z8t/overview_of_the_lithium_market_production/j39lzjk/), but the supply-side of Lithium mining appears to be booming with new mines coming online all over the world. It's increasingly seen as a critical metal and therefore is getting more greenlighted supply around the world. [Graphic](https://i.imgur.com/ZUrZF5M.png) of new supply by 2025 and [recent production expansion](https://i.imgur.com/6YBeeDF.png).

> Analysts at Fastmarkets NewGen estimate global lithium production surged by 36% year-on-year in 2021 and expect total supply will rise from 540,400 tonnes of LCE in 2021 to more than three million tonnes by 2030.

I'd rather stick with copper, whose outlook looks much brighter due to future supply deficits.

The past few days saw positive price outlooks for copper being announced by Trafigura and Goldman Sachs, along with [G&R in their quarterly letter](http://gorozen.com/). Trafigura points out there are only 3.5 days of inventory for copper, which is very tight by historical standards (the number should be more like 20-30 days). Meanwhile there continues to be major shortfalls in production thanks to political instability in Peru.

Jeff Currie:

> “On copper, the forward outlook is extraordinarily postive. We’ll be at the lowest observable inventories that have ever been recorded at 125,000 tonnes. We have peak supply occuring in 2024…Near term we put (the copper price) at $10,500 and longer term our price target is $15,000 a tonne.”

Here is Jeff Currie's longer report [about copper](https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/pages/copper-is-the-new-oil.html).

Trafigura:

> The co-head of metals and minerals at the world’s biggest copper trader said on Monday the copper price could hit a new record high within the next 12 months owing to very tight stocks, even above $12,000 a tonne.

> “I would highlight copper as the most critical metal globally given the shortage in the market. We only had 3.5 days of copper stock equivalent at the end of last year,” Trafigura’s Kostas Bintas told the FT Commodities Global Summit.

March 14th:

> Global copper inventories held in warehouses monitored by the London Metal Exchange (LME) hit the lowest in 17 years last month

Rio Tinto even sees a positive short-term outlook, despite all the fear the past few weeks and muted China recovery. We see evidence of the latter because China smelters are exporting more of their copper they don't need.

The loyalty of their userbase is pretty much ridiculous and they've been releasing great products (M1 Macbooks are incredibly popular among professionals, Airpods have been incredibly successful, iPad is the only tablet people know, Apple Watch has over 3x the market share of second Samsung).

The loyalty of their userbase is pretty much ridiculous and they've been releasing great products (M1 Macbooks are incredibly popular among professionals, Airpods have been incredibly successful, iPad is the only tablet people know, Apple Watch has over 3x the market share of second Samsung). They have operational excellence that very few companies can compare to. Even if they fail with future products (like AR/VR, car), their current portfolio with increasing recurring service revenue is going to keep delivering incredible returns. Their customers are mostly well off and will keep buying expensive phones in a recession. Their loyalty is even higher with young users and not owning an iPhone is a source of embarassment among Gen Z.

PE is a borderline useless metric and anyone who is going to short AAPL based on that is an idiot, sorry.

148,CS," not only possible but that is 100% the reality . 

Not even their  CEO can be sure about the future, how could a CEO know if some of their big clients gonna take their money to JPM.  Public has no info in regards to risk , their accounting is so fancy not even best wall street accountants could decifer it. 

I would suggest going to theshkrelipill channel,,,yes , he is back , he does some of the best fin.statement analysis. 

I had a discussion with a guy who worked at a big bank  , high level position and he said CS was a great buy , It was a while ago ,,,he said many people were buying and that CS was gonna get bought out.  He was right about the buy out but he thought the price was gonna be closer to $5 a share and look what happened. 

I would stay away from them and only day trade them going for  2-3% gains  from like 6am to 10am usually just 2-3 trades and I am done trading them .",john8a7a,0,/r/stocks/comments/11x24uv/beaten_down_regional_banks_how_to_analyze/jd23mho/,0.079,0.826,0.096,0.4932
