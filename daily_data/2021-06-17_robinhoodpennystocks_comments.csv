7,ATOS," Nobody can know for sure what any stock will do. It‚Äôs entirely up to the investor to weigh out and determine what risks they‚Äôre willing to take. A common tactic is to sell enough to get your initial investment back (at a price you‚Äôre happy selling at) and then let the rest ride. This way, your remaining shares are pure profit. This is known as ‚Äúplaying with house money‚Äù. 

I cant see ATOS ever being worthless. Their CEO is, by all definitions, a genius. They have multiple products that they‚Äôre working on that have solid results thus far.

18,SENS," SENS got added to the Russell 3000 and more importantly it has received impressive data demonstrated by its next-gen Eversense glucose monitoring system (CGM) System for up to 180 days in a prospective trial.
Across 49,000 paired points, the overall mean absolute relative difference (MARD) against reference value was 9.1% for the primary sensor, the company said comparing that with 8.5% for the SBA sensor over 12,000 paired points.
MARD is considered to be the most popular method of measuring the accuracy of a glucose monitor. In terms of MARD, Senseonics‚Äô monitor appears to perform neck and neck against rivals.
G6, the latest iteration of glucose monitors from Dexcom (DXCM +2.6%) has an overall MARD of 9.0, according to the Dexcom website.
