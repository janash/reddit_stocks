He also used TSLA to buy Bitcoin then pumped it to make TSLA look more profitable than what it was.

7,GM," I would short it if I could afford the interest payments for a substantial amount of time too. Who knows when the bubble is going to burst? It could go on long enough to bankrupt me.

Can anyone actually make a bullish case for Tesla at this point? Their assets are 56 billion and their market cap is 555 billion. Their revenue is 52b. They have under 2% of the vehicle market. Compare this to GM who's got over 200 billion in assets, generates 120b+ in revenue, and their market cap is a mere 86b. It's just fucking nonsense.

So what you're saying at this point if you buy Tesla instead of GM is: ""I am more confident Muskdaddy can harvest $10 of value from $1 than GM can harvest $0.43 of value from $1.""

I think Elon Musk is pretty good and GM is not great, but I don't think he's 20x better. That's a HUGE target for GM to hit. Keep in mind, when we're talking about management of very large companies it's a pretty narrow band of difference in management capabilities. Shareholders and boards will pay top dollar for management that can harvest 1.1x or 1.2x more value from a dollar than their competitors. We're talking about the Alan Mulally's of the world. CEO's credited with turning around 2 or 3 companies.

The greatest businessmen of all time such as Rockefeller, Ford, Carnegie, Vanderbilt... these guys harvested between 2 and 3 times more value from a dollar than their contemporaries. And that made them the richest, most powerful men in the world capable of making and unmaking *entire nations* in their era. Rockefeller got a billion dollars in *1916*!

33,FCF," The problem with Tesla is the fact that it has already priced-in about 6 years of growth because of hype. A company like Tesla can't stay at a 600 P/E, and 70 P/FCF if the sole reason holding them at such high valuation is hype around a CEO and a social sentiment for the future. See what happened to railroads stocks in the early 1900s, and the car stocks in the 1950s. 

If you think these metrics are able to be maintained, honestly, tell me how. Even Amazon, a company spending billions year over year in R&D, was considered by many (at 100-200 PE) to be overvalued as fuck even after proving they were a cash-cow with AWS, Amazon website, etc. They are even 2x as profitable as Tesla!

 I'm far from thinking that Telsa is dying. But thinking it will become a SUSTAINABLE trillion dollar+ company while:

1. Having a 3% profitability

2. Crazy priced-in valuations (because of hype and 'a sentiment for the future

3. The need to issue 5% more share PER YEAR to sustain operations AND ALSO regulatory credits (money given by the government for developping non-polluting technology 

4. Having an almost bigger market cap than the 12 largests automakers in the world that sell over 90% of the cars 

5. Not really having a monopoly in the EV sector

Tesla is not only an automaker, but without this source of revenue, the company WILL not be able to sustain its growth. So the people saying 'your point is not relevant, Tesla doesn't only make cars' are wrong.

I'm not anti-Tesla, I'm just against betting for the future when it has been proved and demonstrated than jumping on the trend, after it has already exploded, will net you lower returns over the years. You bet money last year? Nice. Betting this year? Meh, it is a bubble only waiting to explode. In the short term, I guess it could rise. 1-2 years maybe? But give it 10-20 years and I guarantee you Tesla will not be where you're expecting it to be. 

Only a 8% compound annual growth rate would put the company at a 2.8T valuation. How would they achieve that? Hell, I think they never will. But whatever, I'm a gay-bear.",TheNumberTw0,3,/r/stocks/comments/new7su/michael_burry_of_the_big_short_reveals_a_530/gykp9e2/,0.056,0.859,0.085,0.8221

You won’t like this but none. 


> Like the Post says I have been steady acquiring Joann fabrics (JOAN) stocks because it is a pick and shovel stock. If you are unfamiliar with the topic, what that means is in a gold rush you don’t go digging for gold you sell the picks and shovels to dig gold. Tech stocks can be way overvalued, so instead of buying Etsy or EBay, one might buy JOAN because it sells to those who sell on those platforms. 



Yeah but people aren’t traveling 1000s of miles to buy yarn so they can knit socks and sell it on EBay. Most people sell used items on EBay anyway. 


Honestly I do not think this logic works in the stock market. It works at the local retail level or online retail level but not with stocks. Think back to where the term came from, the gold rush. People traveled thousands of miles to go mine gold and when they got to the west coast they had to buy equipment from the few people that sold them. Stuff was expensive in the west because stuff was scarce, and the people who came to the west had no other choice but to buy from the local shops in town. The pans they used cost them $8 or about $250 in today’s money. A pair of boots would go for $6 or about $185 today. Rice sold for $8 a pound or about $250 a pound today. As you can see the town shops in the west definitely had the upper hand back then. This being said, the cost of a pan didn’t go up in Virginia, it was only in the small mining towns. So it also takes into account regional aspects as well.

A substantial proportion of capacity expansion is spent on equipment (what ASML sells) because it's wildly expensive to get equipment that can fabricate leading-edge semiconductors. I believe one tool can cost $10M-$20M and that price goes up substantially with each new iteration of chips - look up Moore's Second Law. 

Another reason the stocks are priced like this is because semiconductor equipment is so fucking complicated that each market is dominated by one or two companies which usually combine for 90% market share, meaning hella pricing power.

IPOE (SoFi) shareholder merger approval vote is next week (Ticker symbol change 3 days later)... which led to some price movement yesterday.. but will pick up today and tomorrow.

**Catalyst- The run up to Merger/ Shareholder Vote**
IPOE is following same pre-merger path as IPOB... both ran up to $26, then pulled back to $15.. then IPOB ran up to $32 in the lead up to Vote & Ticker change. IPOE is at $15, about to start the run to leading up to Merger.  This is the Catalyst than will cause a squeeze.

**4 Million May Calls between $17.50 - $22.50**
will trigger $4 Million shares to be bought (not to mention future month $17.50 - $22.50 Calls which are even larger).

**Shorts are weakened**
Also- shorts a now vulnerable. when yesterday ended, around 2,000 total shares were in the sell lines of Level 2. And no resistance over $16.50. Today should be the tipping point.

**SoFi supports a larger valuation**
Also- SoFi supports a much larger valuation. It offers a full range of banking, investing, lending, insurance and has expanded internationally.  also owns Galileo a Baas company (Fintech software, platform.. worth over $2B.  It powers Robinhood, Chime and many others). Additionally, SoFi will be profitable next year and highs higher revenues than Robinhood.. and Sofi is just starting their expansion growth phase.

In preliminary work to go public later in the year.. Robinhood is being valued at $40B.  (compare this to SoFi's valuation at current price if $15 .. which is around $8Billion).

the answer is that it's WTI front month emphasis on front month. It has high volatility and it has been bid up a humongous amount the last two months.

306,WTI," So you went from you have no idea, then lied to me about your question, and now you have some explanation. 

Why do you even bother to post on here

If you were half right, which you aren't, you would've seen a crash through more than WTI. i.e., Saudi Arabia or UAE. We didn't. Even brent didn't crack more than a percent and change down. The reason is because WTI in particular is being buoyed by JCPOA because America is very anti-Iran oil, and a lot of futures traders are making it a self-fulfilling prophecy of sorts. 

Whether you realize it or not (you don't, for the record) you're just seeing some random daily futures contract because Google is tailoring search results to your location. They see American retail investor who knows jack shit, and they show him WTI front month. If you were in Canada maybe it'd be Guernsey Light Sweet or something. If you actually were in oil, to take a random example, maybe they'd show your local Wyoming Sweet. A tale as old as time. But WTI =/= the world's oil supply, or anything like that. I mean this: go back to your crayons

A 2.5% drop in a few minutes is an asterisk. Switch to candles. A smoothed/normalized line graph from whatever free daily futures chart you're looking at will inevitably smooth out all sorts of 2% drops throughout the month.",CommercialFindingNo9,1,/r/stocks/comments/nf66zs/rstocks_daily_discussion_technicals_tuesday_may/gyl9m35/,0.05,0.901,0.049,0.4215

So if a trader bought/sold the same stock 3 times in a week for example and lost 500 bucks and tried to use this as a tax writeoff of some kind it wouldn't work... the IRS would label it a short term wash sale and say screw off thats your loss :) hope that helps.",7LyLa,2,/r/stocks/comments/new9vv/is_there_a_limit_to_how_many_times_you_can_trade/gyijx6y/,0.156,0.738,0.106,-0.5994

Recent earnings report was pretty decent. It beat earnings per share, but was a little below revenue targets because of some supply chain issues, apparently foam is harder to get cause of COVID. But supply chain issues will go away with time. They increased guidance on EPS as well. I think hopefully the beating down of growth stocks is over.

One of the key components to this dynamic is the exemption of software from any sort of legal liability.  

When software is employed in a manner that makes life or death decisions for human beings on a daily, common man level, that liability exemption will evaporate.

Beyond that, there's this fundamental failure of understand what is being ""disintermediated"".  Float.  That is what is being disintermediated.  There is a *remarkable* percentage of capital market investment that comes directly from insurance industry float.  Removal of that float will be devastating for the capital markets.

...but more importantly, what people really fail to understand is that the combination of those two factors is completely non-linear.

421,HD," So your points are:
1. Software has no capabilities of choosing who will die or live in a near-sighted accident situations. - Legal issue.
2. Switching too fast to self-driving will destroy a piece of chains in capitalist economy (insurance industry will be slinmed), which can collapse the economy partially.

To encounter point 1, I think we can eliminate human driving in the near future. By using central HD spatial data and install more IoT sensors ( geo fence, smart traffic control), we can achieve near 100% non human driving. The 5G will be crucial here. But there will be way less traffic, less accident, less death). With enough proves ( death rate statically), most of us will switch to full self driving car if it is free.

To encounter point 2, I think car insurance companies do not contribute to the growth of society. If I remember correctly, they even lobby the lawmaker to mandate this driver must have insurance law. Most of the car insurance is leeches, they go full internet already, they don't promote local job growth

It's possible that NewCo (in which you will receive some equity) will pay a dividend that makes up the difference, but I think the general consensus *at the moment* is that that is unlikely given that they'll need to reinvest a large portion of their FCF into the business to generate content to grow and gain subscribers.

So, it's still a ways off to know exactly (a) how many shares of NewCo you will receive per share of T, (b) what exactly T will cut their dividend to, (c) whether NewCo will pay a dividend, and if so, how much per share.

Whether you sell is completely up to you. I've got 200 shares of T, and I'm still sorting through what I want to do.

460,SOL," Roth IRA is a balance of risk/reward. On one hand, taxes are not a thing, so there is little incentive to hold for long period wrt capital gains, etc. On the other, you cannot easily fund that account, so if you blow it up, then you are SOL.

They seem to want to grow by buying companies and existing drugs rather than through R&D. So debt will remain part of ABBV future, and with ultra low cost of funding loans, it may work in its favor. 

Own it and ABT for a long time, if I had to sell one, would be ABBV as I believe ABT is much lower risk, with more stable growth ahead of it.

464,FSLY," If you are dead set in not selling your winner then there’s little point in selling your losers since the max you can write off in your taxes is 1.5k (if single, 3k if not) – unless you are sure that your losers won’t see a better day (realize a 5k loss next year is still better than realize a 10k loss this year even with the deduction).  I would hold on to the losers unless you need the money to do whatever (including adding to your winners).

Tax harvesting is a way to reduce your realized gain and to limit your risk  in questionable stocks.  If there’s no realized gain, it makes little sense in selling for a loss – unless you think the stock won’t recover and are OK with opportunity cost.

473,IMO," I agree
RIETS are easier to maintain and less of a hassle
But actual properties have a much better ROI if you're dedicated and can give you passive income for a life time and once your mortgage payments are done you can sell the house at an appreciated value. IMO buying actual real estate is way better. It is hectic but worth the ROI. Like OP said he doesn't wanna keep it in exchanges and wants to get insured asap.
