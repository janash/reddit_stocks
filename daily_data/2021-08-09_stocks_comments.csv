1,BNTX," The value of the underlying technology platform carries a higher relative value for BNTX and MRNA. Both of those are early stage, high growth biotech companies, so they're not really valued based on sales, the sales are just a great plus. Both of those companies are more mRNA therapeutics plays, including for cancer treatment and infectious disease vaccines. For Pfizer, being a mature pharma, theyre valued based on their profitability. Theres also relative market caps. If the value of the mRNA vaccine for each other them is like $5B, that will only drive a small rise in Pfizer stock, while MRNA and BNTX skyrocketed.

13,IMO, Moderna and Biontech are the „Tesla“ of Pharma. Their mRNA technology has proven to work on COVID and now they are expected to produce other medicine for Malaria or Cancer. To develop those could take a long time and to generate profit from them even longer. But the COVID vaccine has shown that they are capable to produce a highly effective product generating profits with their new approach. The stock market is trading the hopes in the possible future of mRNA companies and the P/E ratios reflect that. If you ask what car manufacturers are the better buy and compare the P/E ratio of Tesla with the one of Toyota or Volkswagen you come to the same conclusion than with these Pharma stocks. Comparing their stock performance of the last month and years can give an indication where Moderna and Biontech could go and on the other hand how much patience you might need with a Pfizer investment.

24,PFE," With biotech, let's face it, unless u have a PhD in the science, u won't know if their pipeline of drugs will work or not. Biotech is as unknown as it gets. U can randomly read news that it works and is approved and it moves to the next stage or it goes kaput.


I wouldnt put a big position against moderna juz in case they make more blockbuster drugs. We really dunno.
Alternatively, their pipeline may just go bust going forward too.
Who knows?


And considering PFE stock and IBB index, doesn't outperform the S & P 500 in the last 5 years, there is no major reason to hold them long term imo. There are good as a short term trade or if u wanna bet on a specific biotech stock that u think can outperform. As an index, is not worth it.


And considering there is noise and unhappiness against ""price gouging"" drugs, all the more reason to not buy the IBB index.

34,DD," True, which shows that P/E ratio isn’t really a good way of comparing companies.

Pfizer shareholders are heavily diluted compared to Moderna shareholders, so it makes sense that the price would be lower for Pfizer - a well-established company with limited strong growth potential. I imagine there’s also more liquidity in the trading of Pfizer because of the number of shares, which makes its price more stable.

I’d be surprised if Moderna didn’t significantly dilute their shareholders over the next 5-10 years, which is bad news for anyone investing at this high price point now. The stock will go down at some point and that’s the time to buy in (if you’ve done your DD and believe in the company).",Mozza215,1,/r/stocks/comments/p0p46j/why_are_moderna_and_biontech_priced_so_much/h89bfys/,0.057,0.793,0.149,0.8803

I was getting close to giving up and selling recently but I held on so today's news that they are being acquired by DraftKings is great news for me.

I think that DraftKings is getting a great deal on them and it is good for GNOG investors too since even though they were very undervalued, the market just did not give a damn about them so they were probably going to stay undervalued for a long time.

80,CPA," As someone in the industry, I would say it depends.

I say this because you will undoubtedly have questions which we are more qualified to answer than a google search or YouTube video. We also have a great deal of knowledge and access which is either hard to find or unavailable to a lot of people. 

Many people will say no as it’s easy to learn or find on the internet. I would ask myself if I have the time, motivation, or the need to learn it. 

If you enjoy DIY then an advisor isn’t necessary. 

If you want to pay someone to do it all for you while you focus on your career, family, and life, then the fees charged are worthwhile just as much as a good CPA and lawyer are great to have on your team. 

Regarding what to look for in an adviser, search out investment advisers that are registered and Series 65 holders. In the industry, most financial planners are generally holders of product licenses such as Series 6, 7, and 63, or 66. These types of advisors are paid based on the commissions they receive from the products they sell you. This is inherently a conflict of interest, but it is disclosed, so buyer beware.

Series 65 holders are licensed to give advice. They aren’t permitted to effect the purchase or sale of securities unless they have power of attorney or discretionary permission of their clients. Their fees is the advice and management they provide, and these are also the licensees required to adhere to the fiduciary standard designed in the Prudent Investor Act or Uniform Prudent Investor Act.

89,IRS," ETFs can be more tax efficient compared to traditional mutual funds. Generally, holding an ETF in a taxable account will generate less tax liabilities than if you held a similarly structured mutual fund in the same account.

From the perspective of the IRS, the tax treatment of ETFs and mutual funds are the same. Both are subject to capital gains tax and taxation of dividend income. However, ETFs are structured in such a manner that taxes are minimized for the holder of the ETF and the ultimate tax bill (after the ETF is sold and capital gains tax is incurred) is less than what the investor would have paid with a similarly structured mutual fund.",alamedastrip,4,/r/stocks/comments/p0r7t2/should_i_hire_a_financial_advisor/h8b1m2f/,0.013,0.919,0.068,0.7474

93,YOU," Long thesis? At this point, if you still need an explanation, you probably hate money. 

1. CEO leaves after fraud allegations. If the company is legit, why leave? You can easily disprove it in court.
2. Trevor sold shares recently and had it transferred to his wife. Interesting. Someone who believes in the company and said they were close to releasing their product is selling shares when Nikola is near all-time low. Who does that? 
3. This is a company whose entire revenue thus far is from solar panels that Trevor Milton purchased. 
4. Revenue guidance for future sales and orders continue declining. Again, if you claim your product is near release, your guidance should be improving because more companies would be interested. The lack of interest and declining guidelines just prove these companies are just getting sick of the b/s and no longer want to deal with Nikola. Could you imagine if Tesla is about to release a new vehicle and revenue/orders begin declining by more than half?
5. The next b/s that Wall Street is pushing is that Nikola is losing less money so some are bullish. LOL. The reason they are losing less money is because they are receiving less in funding and their cash deposits are dwindling which means they have to spend less periodically to keep this charade going. They can't get any new funding unless someone is high as a kite. COVID is the perfect excuse for them to lie about higher supplies cost and the availability of parts. 
6. The #1 most obvious implication of this being a fraud was when Nikola basically threw Trevor Milton, their former CEO and current largest shareholder, under the bus when the fraud allegations were made aware. If you're Nikola (management), you've been working with this guy for years. Trevor Milton couldn't have possibly hid this fraud just by himself. It had to be a team effort. So how did YOU, as the management of a billion dollar company by valuation, let this go unnoticed for this long? If you've been this idiotic to let Trevor Milton lie to you all this time, how the hell are you going to realistically release a product that is actually working? It makes no sense. They need to investigate everyone who was in the company and had an executive role in the company.

208,HPQ," I know its a lot, but HPQ is one of those companies that I would love to get on a sale but its not ""buy-at-any-price"". 

I just looked up too and in 2021 Q2 their PC revenue was $10.6b but only $710m operating profit while printing was $5.3b in revenue but $951m in operating profit. So that's when literally everyone was buying a PC. In more normal times, for example, in 2019 Q2 PC revenue were $8.9b and $385op, and printing was $5.1b and $839op.

So their PC business is low margin (around 4%) and their printing business is higher margin (around 17%) but we can agree that it is in decline. Now, in 2020-21 it did well because people bought printers to print from home but really their main revenue maker is selling B2B printing supplies. How many people will come back to the office? How much printing will there be? And even then we are moving more and more towards digitization and less printing. PCs as I mentioned before is low margin high competition business so nothing to speak of.  Not to mention that business is absolutely loaded up with debt. I mean HPQ has negative shareholders equity.

Having that said, dividend is high and I like what their new CEO is doing (although hes a bit weird guy) but still, I would need significant margin of safety to buy any HPQ.

Many more plant food/hydroponic people coming into the market so the market will become more fractured.  Also you are assuming that growers will prefer $SMG over other products for their cannabis.

They have many other vaccines and personalized cancer treatments in their pipeline too.

COVID is expected to become endemic, so COVID shots will be a regular thing like the flu. They are also looking into creating a 4-in-1 “respiratory vaccine” which includes COVID, flu, hMPV, and RSV, which would be taken annually, which could help sustain profits and fund research in the pipeline. They started collaborating with outside partners for an HIV vaccine, have Epstein-Barr in the pipeline (virus that causes mono), and have a vaccine of a potential contagion-like virus in early stages of research (Nipah if you’re curious)

I was hesitant before, but now I plan to buy more, they crushed earnings and still have a lot of doses to go.

Always, always, *ALWAYS* keep at least 6-12 months worth of your expenses in cash. Ready to go at a moment’s notice. 


Now, if your plan is to use that cash in a “nuclear winter” type scenario to buy things like non-perishable food items, fuel, ammunition, etc. Wares that are only useful when cash ceases to matter much, if at all, you’re going to be SOL. 
There’s going to be a long line of people already outbidding you and outpacing you to reach those wares.


Correct me if I’m wrong, but it seems like you’re asking how you can go from extremely illiquid Rich Uncle Pennybags to tin-foil hat prepper in less than one business day. If that’s the case, you need to cash out 6-12 months worth of cash ASAP and take out another $10-$15K to build a stockpile of food, ammunition, fuel, learn basic outdoor survival skills and get training on your firearms (basically start prepping) because the scenario you are painting (sounds worse than the Great Depression) will get real ugly, real quick. We had a virus with a survival rate of 99.8% hit and within month after the WHO declared it a pandemic, the entire country was out of Lysol, toilet paper, ammunition, Clorox and face masks.
