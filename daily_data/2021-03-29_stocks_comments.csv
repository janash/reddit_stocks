5,DD," Is the company mature or is it a young growth stock?  
Generally in bigger mature companies c-suite management are remunerated via stocks. So if they want that holiday home they’re selling stocks (even if they think the company will be successful).  
If it’s a young company expecting huge growth it probably isn’t an amazing sign - just factor it into all the other DD you do.  
It does seem odd that the CFO could sell shares so early so I’m assuming it isn’t a mature company, as you mentioned companies commonly use share issues to incentivise talented c-suite employees to stick around for years.  
If it’s a penny stock then alarm bells should be ringing, as plenty of them these days seem to be designed to enrich management and disappear.",daveor,1,/r/stocks/comments/mfrpiz/if_a_cfo_sells_a_few_million_worth_of_stock_a_few/gsq3hdr/,0.045,0.742,0.214,0.9721

14,CS," Can someone try to explain, in plain English, how this scenario unfolded -- assuming it was largely triggered by a margin call?  

Allegedly, Archegos was either *long* stocks like ViacomCBS and Discovery, or held derivatives tied to their stock prices appreciating -- or both -- and the stocks started dropping in value early last week.  We are assuming the initial decline had nothing to do with Archegos, correct?  And then at some point, on Thursday or Friday, their value ostensibly dropped below Archegos's margin maintenance requirement with places like CS and Nomura (?), thus prompting/requiring Archegos to cash out in a major way in order to fulfill its obligations to those banks?

Assuming this is correct . . . why would Archegos have needed to sell **$20B** in shares -- based on news reports?   This sounds like a staggering amount of money.  Does that not assume that they had to have been long those positions in the first place?

You want to maximize your gains and to do this in the short , you need to understand the movements. So you analize the plot, candles, TIs and everything else you can so you can be sure you have a tactic regarding this stock.

For example. You found stock XYZ at 47.5$. After your TA, you concluded that of the price goes bellow 46$ it will tank to 40$, but if it goes to 49$ it will soar to 55$.

&#x200B;

I follow stocks almost daily. I ´ve been dabbling / Investing for a good portion of 20 years now. 

I´ve seen plenty of times where patterns from TA were indeed working.

I have only recently added a pattern indicator in my tradeview account and almost all sell / buy signals on all stocks I did test runs with were right, most of the time. (lets say about 75% of the time.

yet I always have t remember:   
\- only about 10% of acutal daytraders (professional , educated and informed traders) beat the market consistently. 

\- not even 10% of Forex traders make actual profit conistently.

daytraders and forex traders seem to rely heavily on TA as they rarely stay long enough into any investment to make FA even worthwile to spend time on. 

So I draw my own conclusions on this: if it would be working and would be more reliable, the yields of traders would be much muich higher than they are in reality. again, I am talking consistent , long term profits. not having a few good weeks, months or even years.

59,RSI," I don't think it is BS for ""short-term"" signals especially. I also don't believe you would get the most out of it ""as a human"". Some people try to visually ""see"" some shapes or trying to come up with special magic numbers say on RSI (for example) which I believe are not very reliable. 

For example, there simple technical trading using RSI values that go above 70 and come below 30; I algorithmically used machine learning to discover proper values for RSI long/short trades strategy ([https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/042114/overbought-or-oversold-use-relative-strength-index-find-out.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/042114/overbought-or-oversold-use-relative-strength-index-find-out.asp))  on S&P500 holdings, and realized that 70/30 rule of RSI is not holding for the majority of the securities in S&P500 and most of the securities had their RSI pair-value for better trading. So if you are blindly, for example, follow overbough/oversold RSI trading strategy to select your holdings, you might end up losing money without having ability to finetune the parameters automatically.

 I personally think, in this day and age, if you are going to be using technical indicators, you need to rely on computational models and algorithms. They are better suited to ""discover"" patterns specific to individual securities using technical indicators and test their reliability, unlike many humans! Also, you must acknowledge that discovered pattern might have a very low lifespan and you might end up looking for new ones! so you are better off finding a way to automate this whole process.

Secondly isn't Tesla more than a car company? Don't they do things with energy and insurance as well? Not to mention bitcoin now (that's a different story). I think Tesla has big plans for the future as really if you think about it they're pretty much a new company in terms of long term big picture thinking. The old guard GM Ford Chrysler all had to start somewhere as well, but they are now old companies and quite frankly I think out of touch and have no vision, regardless of their current pivoting to EV. I've owned all of the big 3 at some point and I can honestly say never again. They make garbage. I drive a Toyota, regardless what you think of Toyota as a company, the Japanese are technology and quality driven, I think that's what Tesla is going for and will probably introduce a dividend at some point in its history. Again, I don't own shares of Tesla, and I don't know the stocks history, but wasn't there a short squeeze on it before when it was at $40?

224,ATH," I own too much Dis not to pay attention. They have been falling off good news for 2+ weeks now, and I believe they are the ""Apple"" of cyclical/reopening stocks.

Apple started falling from its ATH a long time ago despite being a great stock and company. They were the indicator for what started with the rest of Tech in February.

The recovery fad is already over and at this point it's people trying to fool other people to pump up stocks that historically never were even that great and now are at ATHs (notice Disney got crushed as soon as it hit a new ATH when everyone was talking about how great reopening plays are).

(I'm not saying Disney is not a great stock, I'm saying they are premier but I would never touch oil/airplanes/cruise ships/etc at this point)

I'll buy the tech dip as long as it's major companies who have a great 5-10 years ahead of them. If Nasdaq's not bouncing relatively soon, aka April, then our market is screwed anyways. Goign back to Apple, however, they are hanging in there just fine today, so the cycle does appear to me to be coming around.

This is not advice, but I'm comfortable riding this out.

A company is considered to be in a space-related business if its product(s) either has as its essential purpose — or is dependent upon — space-based functions (the revenue produced by space related companies is referred to as “space revenues). In the case of companies that make products that go into space (such as launch vehicles), or companies that operate systems in space (such as satellites), the space-related nature of the business is clear. For companies whose products and services are solely used on the surface of the Earth, space must play an essential role in the business in order to be classified as “space-related”. For example, a GPS smartwatch is not a viable product without its GPS satellite connectivity, while a car with GPS navigation can still serve its basic function without that space-related perk.",turkeychicken,3,/r/stocks/comments/mflod9/rstocks_daily_discussion_monday_mar_29_2021/gsooauh/,0.007,0.941,0.052,0.8663

March is traditionally a very challening month for the market and tech has been particially hammered. The upside is that April is traditionally one of the best months for the stock market.

Or to an extent it might just be right place right time last year with Ark, like a winning NCAA tourney bracket... a lot of luck goes into it, and obviously DD, but sometimes the luck is more important.

2. GDP growth will be tremendous next year or so.  This will increases earnings for value, small cap and cyclicals ... Not so much for innovation (their earnings are far out in the future not now).  High earnings will spark flows into cyclicals and way from innovation (this has actually been happening over last several months)

Almost all of ARK stocks are momentum stocks and have been inflated by trend traders ... If momentum dies so may the sky-high prices.

That said, there is more room on the upside ... We're not in crazy bubble territory yet ... Its possible that post-covid euphoria could drive all prices higher ...

I have. And their earnings haven't changed much. from the height of 2020.

projected earnings are also relatively flat compared to 2019.

401,GME," In this case, because when it goes flat on GME and when there is low volume, with out SSR, the tendency is for a breakout down.

I'm wanting to hop in for a run up, I'm quite bullish, but options are very expensive, so they arent an option, really.

The cost of the share is borderline prohibitive, so I'm actually hopeful for some prolice drop before it rockets, if it does at all.

Being realistic, the gamma side of thing eases on the options market.  Plus no one in their right mind is exercising a 180c option.  Just wait a few months and buy shares at 50 when the price drops.

So for short squeeze, I'm not sold it will happen.  We saw the market swat it down and slap the share price in the face at 340, and again after the earnings report, resulting in a sell off.

Dividends is a different type of tax and you get 2k dividends tax free allowance a year, then it's taxed at 7.5% for lowest tax bracket.

I think residential solar is inevitable.  To the best of my knowledge, Enphase and Tesla are the only manufacturers of home power storage batteries that can be used with different types of power.  Enphase is respected within the solar community, but is, and this is how it was explained to me: Many current solar users use alternative energy because they want to be “off the grid.”  ENPH doesn’t really market to these buyers beyond some of their niche products that are above my understanding.  ENPH residential services are like a Nest thermostat- you’re able to to control and monitor from your phone, it’s an expensive investment, installers have to do everything, but they have an excellent support network.  They integrate with tons of solar companies as well.

Have of the penny stocks I see DD on that are about to explode have documents that state we never expect to be profitable.  They just slowly filoute the stock every time it is pumped and pay themselves from the company.  It’s just a legal kind of fraud.  Except their documents tell you it’s fraud.  If they are paying high rent to an accountant for their HQ address, never expect to turn a profit, etc it’s never a long term play.  

With everything, especially pennies it’s important to do your DD and know what red flags to look for.  I do own several pennies.

462,CAP," 
It’s true more stock means more diversified however diversification is more than just number of stock. When you think about risk with diversification:


Go through these steps:
1. Equity or bonds - you’re young so you can afford to take on risk. Standard recommendation is you can go 90/10 or 95/5
2. Country/region: most people are in US only because that’s what they see and what they have information access to. International exposure provides that diversification or even outperformance. 
3. Small or large cap: small caps are more volatile than large caps because they tend to have more risks associated with them also less access to capital like larger companies 
4. Industry breakdown: you already saw it where large cap tend to be tech heavy just because that sector gained so much. 

Most of funds or etfs can help you control 1 and 2 really well, somewhat on 3 and less on 4. But that’s ok 1 2 and 3 drives a lot of the returns. 

FSSNX - https://fundresearch.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/composition/316146182
FZROX - https://fundresearch.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/composition/31635T708

Ok looks like you got a EQUITY US SMALL CAP, EQUITY US LARGE CAP

You can own both like a 70/30 split FZROX/FSSNX....large cap provides a more steady return while small cap provides an enhanced return. 
However you’re still only in US Equities


Final note on fidelity. I don’t like them after so many accounts (401K and brokerages). I find them expensive, and their exp ratios is always higher than comparable vanguard index funds. Of course $6000 doesn’t matter right now about  extra 0.5%. Hey you’re a med student...it’s good to know some of the basics of this stuff.

463,UK," Haha, I’m also in the UK and my parents are fixated on the price per share, only going for cheap companies and thinking it’s a good deal because you then own more shares (compared to investing the same capital in companies with more expensive shares). I had to wonder if that advice in the OP came from your parents.

In reality I don’t think it matters much at all, assuming you can buy fractional shares. ‘Cheap’ shares might not move very much or even fall, while ‘expensive’ shares can still give you good gains. I don’t have much money invested but am still able to grow it by paying more attention to the possible percentage change in a stock rather than the absolute price.

Another piece of advice would be to use a broker that gives you access to US shares as well as UK shares. I (personally) find the US market much more exciting!

465,DD," Although i agree to an extent, the FDA has already fast tracked two psychedelic trials, one of which from the currently largest company in the space, Compass pathways, which is researching fixing treatment resistant depression. Also Mind Medicine is working on Phase 2A trials for MC-18, a drug that if successful, solves the entire opioid epidemic. If the science is there to back it up and the FDA approves any psychedelic treatments it doesn’t matter what politicians have to say, none of these companies are pushing for recreational use, so legislation doesn’t matter. The key is that these trials are working to get psychedelics approved as drugs for treatment with a therapist, *none* of them want your average joe blow to be able to buy LSD or shrooms at a walmart. These treatments are setting out to fix and take over entire markets in sweeps; the opioid epidemic, addiction in general, and *treatment resistant* depression are all entirely open markets that are just waiting for a company to swoop in and dominate. 

I think with the focus on FDA approval as opposed to legislation, alongside the growing concerns of mental health in the states and internationally, if there is science to back it up they can all make bank. Many people are apprehensive about psychedelics but a lot of the negative stigma would change drastically if there were trained professionals offering a service to fix a currently unfixable problem. 

Thats just my 2 cents, i could be entirely wrong. Im not arguing that its not extremely speculative, because it is. Im just saying that if some of these drugs get approved, there is a huge market for them to make money (they’re all looking to finish trials within the next 2-3 years). Currently its insanely speculative as nobody knows if any of these drugs will pass or work, BUT there has been decades of research and anecdotal experiences that heavily point towards their successes. Obviously do your own DD, im not advocating for anyone to invest, i just truly find the space fascinating

521,ENPH," I can't speak to SPWR in particular (though I hold 300 shares). They recently sold a lot of ENPH stock close to its high, so they had a sudden rush of money that's not related to the core of their business, thus their 2020 Q4 results shouldn't be considered representative. 

Solar in general has passed a major milestone in 2019/2020 in which it became cheaper than nuclear power (residential solar) and even natural gas (utility solar). Since solar is likely to get cheaper still due to Swanson's law (similar to Moore's law), the tailwinds are very strongly at the back of all stocks in this sector. 

That said, as  an investor I've noticed that the rise in the price of solar equities like SPWR is correlated to EVs. It wouldn't surprise me if solar is just tagged ""green high growth"" in algorithms along with hydrogen and EVs. Right now a lot of their movement is correlated, even though in my opinion the case for solar is much stronger  in the medium and long term than either hydrogen or EVs.

525,MA," Sell orders often fail. My own issue is that I have stop loss orders in place, but for only part of my shares, because I haven’t been paying attention how many I had. 

Basically it should do fine, just not be the leader it’s been. Better to think long term than short term, though all losses suck. In general, I try to sell if stocks break the 50 day MA or 100 day MA, which causes further losses, depending on my timeline. If things cross the 50 day MA on strong volume it can mean really bad things.

Do you plan to add to your REIT allocation if TSM grows or only when you feel like REITs deserve more of your cash?

I would love to dedicate my entire Roth to REITs but wouldn’t know how to factor that into all of my other holdings. I don’t want to “have” to have a 10% REIT allocation.",manlymatt83,1,/r/stocks/comments/mfeqzd/does_anyone_just_own_scv_reits_etc_outright/gsn5twa/,0.0,0.92,0.08,0.5859
575,FCF," Yeah that’s a dilemma. To be honest the way I have it now, I did a major overhaul of my Roth earlier this year so I’m basically slightly overweight REITs compared to where I’ll end up based on my contributions and some basic calculations. I’ve overshot it slightly but over the year it’ll adjust back to where I want it, about 15%. I’m a believer in REITs and overall I have a fairly barbell approach, with a decent bifurcation between “growth” and “value/income”. I don’t like to describe them as such because my growth names have great FCF generation already, they just don’t pay a dividend. And likewise my value/income names are still growing and in some cases (some REITs) in very aggressive expansion mode. So it’s overall very nuanced, but either way most of my money is in TSM and an international allocation. 

To answer your question, I’d contribute more to REITs definitely, especially if they’re good value at the time. I just need to consider the tax implications since the Roth contribution is a small fraction every year and in the end I don’t want REITs to get dwarfed by everything else.",lomoprince,1,/r/stocks/comments/mfeqzd/does_anyone_just_own_scv_reits_etc_outright/gsn9swg/,0.034,0.808,0.158,0.9786
