Attorney? Ok
All assets to non-profits? BS
Family “knew” about $ but didn’t receive any? BS 
   Initial $$$$ was “inherited” leaving legal 
   insinuation it was intended to “care for” family.
   That means his “extra” accumulated $ was pre-
   marked for other family (nuclear or extended).
   If he had ANY previous “will” that mentioned a 
   family members name, will contested & reversed. 
   Any family having ever received $ from him instant   
   reversal for “failure to properly provide for”. We 
   can do this for awhile. So I’ll stop!

10,NYC," Food banks can be huge. Take [Chicago's Food Bank](https://www.chicagosfoodbank.org/about/), for example. From the about page:

> We act as the hub for a network of more than 700 food pantries, soup kitchens, shelters and other programs. These programs provide food where it’s most needed. We also address the root causes of hunger. Public benefits outreach and job training programs offer support for our neighbors to overcome poverty.

Or from [Food Bank for New York City](https://1giqgs400j4830k22r3m4wqg-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/FBNYC_Annual-Report_FY2019.pdf):

> 57.5 million meals distributed to 1.4 million new yorkers

> 132 free meals moved per minute

That corresponds to an overhead of less than one cent per meal if the Executive director for NYC was earning $400K/year. About 1/6 of that organization's expenses are management and fundraising. About $5 million for management, $3 million fundraising.

This doesn't include additional costs incurred at each individual food pantry, since they primarily depend on food banks, although  they take local donations, too.",antirabbit,6,/r/stocks/comments/mf7tae/unknown_stock_market_investor_died_with_188m_in/gsn3d41/,0.033,0.887,0.08,0.7717
11,OR," But therein lies the problem. CEOs are compared to other CEOs. In that sense the CEO that makes 5% more looks rich compared to the CEO making 5% less. So they compete against themselves. But 5% of $400K is $20K. That $20K could be the entire salary of a non profit worker that's not a CEO. So each year, the CEOs are trying to make more than the CEO next to them, not considering the downstream effects. Before you know it, CEOs are getting yearly raises, bonuses, and other compensation worth way more to the rest of society, but they only see it as a marginal benefit to them. As a result, CEO and executive pay runs rampant at little to no benefit to the actual charity under the guise that it's fair because other CEOs with runaway salary's are making that much. Another way to think about it is, what is the marginal value of a 5% raise to someone making $20K a year vs. $200K a year. Now, what is $10k to someone making $20K a year vs someone making $200K a year. OR, what is $10K toward the actual mission of the charity, if it's, say a food bank, that's a hell of a lot of canned goods and non perishables. The marginal benefit is significantly higher to the lower paid worker. So, while $400K a year among CEOs may not be a big deal. Simply paying a salary of $400K a year in a nonprofit setting, may be.",snowmanvt,6,/r/stocks/comments/mf7tae/unknown_stock_market_investor_died_with_188m_in/gsn7r0z/,0.063,0.812,0.125,0.949

67,GOOGL," Depends on the stock. There are lots of ways to see when a stock is soaring high enough to justify closing your position or taking profits. 

When a stock is dramatically overvalued. When it's growth potential gets destroyed. When its industry/sector is or will be dramatically compromised. When holding that stock gives you less earning potential than investing in another stock.

Is GOOGL a good stock? I believe so. Is it a long term hold? Absolutely. 

But I just sold it to buy  stocks for companies that will profit from infrastructure (Biden to announce that plan shortly).

GOOGL went down 3.5%. My infrastructure stocks went up 10%.

When infrastructure stocks are overvalued, I will sell those stocks and rebuy GOOGL (assuming it's at the right price).

94,GM," First off, I own no shares of Tesla cause it's too expensive for me. 

Secondly isn't Tesla more than a car company? Don't they do things with energy and insurance as well? Not to mention bitcoin now (that's a different story). I think Tesla has big plans for the future as really if you think about it they're pretty much a new company in terms of long term big picture thinking. The old guard GM Ford Chrysler all had to start somewhere as well, but they are now old companies and quite frankly I think out of touch and have no vision, regardless of their current pivoting to EV. I've owned all of the big 3 at some point and I can honestly say never again. They make garbage. I drive a Toyota, regardless what you think of Toyota as a company, the Japanese are technology and quality driven, I think that's what Tesla is going for and will probably introduce a dividend at some point in its history. Again, I don't own shares of Tesla, and I don't know the stocks history, but wasn't there a short squeeze on it before when it was at $40? Maybe that's why they refuse to dilute the stock so nobody thinks of trying to short it again. Correct me if I'm wrong.

Cash being low is a concern since ARKK is experiencing outflows and the more that happens the more she will need to start selling positions to cover them.  Meme stocks in particular are falling from grace and it's also possible with the economy reopening that people are losing interests in playing the stock market.

I think puts on any bear market / OB rally is easy money now and for the foreseeable future. What's clear to me is that these stocks are 90% hyped up, air-gapped, over-valued garbage and the flagship company in the fund can't decide if they make EV's, make new batteries, trade BTC, have a lock on autonomous driving or want to colonize another fucking planet.",Gravity-Rides,6,/r/stocks/comments/mf4qmg/arkk_has_put_in_a_bottom/gslnyb3/,0.106,0.735,0.159,0.7359

134,ATH," I think the ""nighmare scenario"" that a lot of the new retailers that invested in tech near the ATH may come start to unfold: 

Big Tech recovering \~halfway, while speculative/growth stocks and ETFS remaining near their bottoms for an extended period of time. This means a majority of stock portfolios for these newbie retailers being down 30-50% for 6+ months. 

And at the same time, the major indices (DOW, SP500) and value stocks shooting up.

135,TSLA," So... they shouldn’t present their case for predicted future value based on their understanding of future market conditions? I really don’t see how their forecast for Tesla is a conflict of interest. Transparency and forecasting are part of Ark’s thing.

Basically their entire prospectus is oriented around this idea that these technologies will hit an inflection point as they approach mass adoption and their stock values will grow rapidly. When they show their work on this for Tesla, everyone freaks out and says “Hey wait a minute, that’s too much! You can’t do that! They’re just pumping!” Those arguments just don’t hold much water with me. What would be the point in pumping something with a five year forecast? The timeline is too long for the pump to matter, even if the price rises short term it will drop to what people are comfortable with inside of that timeframe. Would damage the funds reputation for no real gain. I think it’s just cynicism run amok. Their TSLA evaluation is just an example of the kind of growth that Ark has always claimed is at the center of their investment strategy. But everyone gets all offended when they predict exactly what they always said they were trying to target. Maybe they’ll be right on Tesla, or maybe they’ll be right on one of their other holdings, that’s why you buy the fund instead of just TSLA. If a few take off the fund as a whole benefits. If Ark is wrong, the risk is distributed amongst their other holdings. 

If you compare five year growth for any major companies that have been successful with new technology, Ark’s evaluation for Tesla looks aggressive but not really obscene. This of course assumes Ark is right about TSLA being much more than just as auto manufacturer. A lot can change in five years.",urk_the_red,29,/r/stocks/comments/mf4qmg/arkk_has_put_in_a_bottom/gsllsy4/,0.057,0.868,0.075,0.8371

Also the biggest thing is people for some reason believe investing in TSLA == investing in Elon.

Elon has said numerous times TSLA isn't his endgame; he just wanted to light a fire under the world's car manufacturers towards sustainable cars (EVs). And he has accomplished that.

142,JP," There are securities laws at federal and state level that govern this, even internationally.  An analysts role is to do an analysis and publish reports on valuations, including assumptions and the whole bang shoot.  They’re supposed to be objective and have an iron wall between them and the marketing people and overall leadership who are making investment decisions with other people’s money. Some analysts put a $67 price on Tesla others $1,200.  Imagine if the CEOs of Barclays, City Group, JP Morgan, Roth Capital, Bernstein or Gordon Johnson would go all over social media and tweet that Tesla is 60 to 90% over priced in the market. It would cause mayhem.  What do they all have in common? Their analysts have all issued reports with abysmal price targets.  One, it would be extremely unprofessional for them to do so, at worst they could refer to their analyst reports, I don’t think they even do that. But to put their opinion on it would, in my opinion, be breaking the ethics code. Same for Ms Wood, what makes hers all the more stark is the extent of her valuations and the depth that her funds (with other people’s money) are invested. Again, just my opinion.

156,TSLA," They’re a small company for all that they hold a lot of money, and analysis is central to their entire operation. Saying that the analyst wing of the company should make announcements and not the CEO, is like saying the aquatic part of an orca should swim and not the blowhole.

And they are an investment company not a car company. It makes perfect sense for them to announce price targets for their holdings. More than it would for Musk to announce stock price targets for Tesla. 

To me it seems clear that Ark truly believes in their analysis of Tesla’s potential share price in five years. Whether you agree with them or not seems a better place to stake an argument than saying that a fund shouldn’t be transparent about what they believe the value proposition for one of their holdings is.

Let the quarterly earnings come through and the tech sector will prove it's worth....these are good blue chip stocks.

As for the other sectors like growth and speculative plays such as in the ark k fund they will have to improve their quarterly  earnings and EPS to show they can be profitable it will take a more than one year.....I recommend you watch some of the recent videos  of cathie wood where she talks abt growth stocks...and wht to expect....from her funds.

So I say for the above hold and hold dont sell....concentrate on 2 things
Average down if you have spare cash.......and increase your cash holdings too SAVE sit on cash.....remember  cash is an asset too.

As for Chilean funds...if u cant see an improved outlook...you might just have to take a loss...thts part of investing and learning the best Investers lose money it's part of the game....so cut your losses be honest about the future potential  of those investments.

179,USA," Yeah i don't really want to invest in specific stocks because of this. Losing 70% of my portfolio wouldn't even surprise me after all that's happened. I can see your point there, being -17% in the red is not really that bad, but it's been 5 years of not being able to use that money, 5 years of disciplined saving in an indexed fund which is supposed to be safer and it's been nothing but losing money in my personal experience.

So i think i'm doing something wrong. I'm bullish on Chile: fast vaccination, the index is not in a bubble, actually over 1.5 standard deviations lower than other countries according to analysts. So it should keep recovering right? But these terrible events keep happening, one after another. So i dont really know what i should do.

So i take this fintech fund that invests in USA tech mainly and the next day i'm in the red already. And the next month is worse and now it keeps getting worse and worse. It honestly looks as if I single-handedly caused the tech-sector crash because of me investing in it. 

So yeah, i'll just keep waiting for years and years while my portfolio keeps crashing and crashing. Maybe in 20 years i'll be at 0% again?

195,TA," my personal experience and my personal opinion: 

&#x200B;

I follow stocks almost daily. I ´ve been dabbling / Investing for a good portion of 20 years now. 

I´ve seen plenty of times where patterns from TA were indeed working.

I have only recently added a pattern indicator in my tradeview account and almost all sell / buy signals on all stocks I did test runs with were right, most of the time. (lets say about 75% of the time.

yet I always have t remember:   
\- only about 10% of acutal daytraders (professional , educated and informed traders) beat the market consistently. 

\- not even 10% of Forex traders make actual profit conistently.

daytraders and forex traders seem to rely heavily on TA as they rarely stay long enough into any investment to make FA even worthwile to spend time on. 

So I draw my own conclusions on this: if it would be working and would be more reliable, the yields of traders would be much muich higher than they are in reality. again, I am talking consistent , long term profits. not having a few good weeks, months or even years. 

&#x200B;

Well lots of retail traders and institutions trade via computer algorithms who’s job it is to automatically execute trades usually based on technical indicators.

239,IRS," I invest mainly in VTI and using a backtest analysis from when I started investing in 2016 or so VTI returned nearly 2% more with dividends reinvested. 13.4% vs 15.5%. Historically though this is a good return. 

Dividends are def a ""boomer thing"" but there's nothing wrong with that. I'm a professional with a self-managed retirement account and didn't even really understand dividends (other than reinvesting the random money that showed up in my SEP IRA) until the IRS sent me a ""FYI you owe us taxes on yo dividends"" letter last year..

Look to the west for growth stocks or check how your bank/country handles dividend taxation on foreign exchanges. 

Since you’re young you should embrace growth and volatility. Do not overestimate diversification, five stocks are a good start - two does well, two does ok and one does shit. As your capital grows and you find new opportunities you may want to start diversifying or just abandon old investments. 

As long are you are continually dropping money in to the market you’re pretty much immune to dips and crashes over the long run.

Perhaps pick 2 really good solid blue chips, 2 solid growth companies and then 1 high risk/high reward play (with Max 10% weight).

Profit us calculated everytime to sell a share.

You won't be taxed if you make 2k as this is within your 12k allowance.

Dividends is a different type of tax and you get 2k dividends tax free allowance a year, then it's taxed at 7.5% for lowest tax bracket.

I had to wonder if that advice in the OP came from your parents.

In reality I don’t think it matters much at all, assuming you can buy fractional shares. ‘Cheap’ shares might not move very much or even fall, while ‘expensive’ shares can still give you good gains. I don’t have much money invested but am still able to grow it by paying more attention to the possible percentage change in a stock rather than the absolute price.

Another piece of advice would be to use a broker that gives you access to US shares as well as UK shares. I (personally) find the US market much more exciting!
