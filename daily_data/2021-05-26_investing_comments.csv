* James Bond
* Stargate
* Rocky
* Pink panther
* Robocop

4,TV," This is the ""siloing"" of content distribution that the entertainment industry has been saying would happen. The key takeaway is that Amazon has massive revenue streams outside of entertainment media that other distributors don't, asides from Disney who has major merchandising and theme parks. Amazon is wisely using that cash to gain ground, not just with this deal but also producing a Lord of the Rings based TV show for over $400 million dollars. That's a budget roughly more than twice of any season of Game of Thrones. It is a massive investment for a TV show, one that no other studio can even match. Prime also has amazing value outside of video, really they give the video away for almost free. At this point Netflix needs to build more alliances with rivals instead of being its own island, or branch out into other services/revenue streams, otherwise it will lose immense market share.",Epiphany79,2,/r/investing/comments/nli79t/amazon_will_buy_mgm_film_and_television_in_845/gzjjbdg/,0.038,0.81,0.152,0.9465

55,FB," Yeah, some M&As go well. Some go bad.

Also, how long are you involved with a company after a M&A? 3 months? 6 months? 3 years? What's the turnover like after 6 months? Sure, 10-20% is nice, but that is not a lot of money. Especially if they were working under startup pay. They now are just at what they are worth at big companies. 

Sure, some people have stock options. How many of the entire workforce? 20%? 50%? Usually, it's only the employees considered integral to the success of the company. So either the initial/founding employees or the people that came on later that had a ""secret sauce"" to make the company successful. But the grunts doing the work, they usually don't get anything. Especially if they joined the company after the first 50 employees.

I've been involved in M&A that went decent. The upside is you have a bigger company. The downside is you have a bigger company.

Small companies are good because they have to be nimble and smart. They also have few employees, so communication is typically better between the CEO and the grunts. There are also a lot of downsides to working with small companies. 

When you move to a big company, communication is less efficient just due to their size. It's hard for someone to communicate efficiently with more than about 5-10 people. When your company is 1000 people, the CEO talks to the C-Suite executives, the C-Suite talks to VPs, the VPs talk to mid level managers, and the mid level mangers talk to employees. That makes the CEO 3 levels disconnected from employees. Communication is not efficient that way. 

A ""reasoning"" between M&A is that they say they cut overhead, and that's true. If we lived in a world where everybody made the same fucking widget and had the same exact HR department. Like when FB took over Instagram. They say they made ""instagram"" more efficient. All they did was integrate Instagram into FB to boost FB and Instagram. They stopped innovating Instagram on its own. 

That's the net effect of a M&A. A large business is looking to turn an innovative company into a lackluster shit pile of operations. 

That's because something like 80% of M&A are designed specifically to eliminate competition. It's hard to find the exact number because of course every lawyer at the M&A companies is going to say ""Oh, it's about innovation, not competition"" because otherwise they'll get in trouble with anti-trust law **Cough cough** Zukerburg **Cough cough**. But cutting through the bullshit, that's what it's all about. 

At a big company, innovation is extremely hard. The reason is that a big company has executives who make decisions. These executives usually don't have a good grasp of how the lower levels work. And tech/efficiency innovations usually occur at the lower levels. Executives make business innovations that are usually just operation improvements. Because they are typically managing via numbers. And you can never spot a tech innovation by looking at P&L statements. So a big business typically is stuck only doing operation improvements. It's the reason why Ford/GM could never figure out how to build an EV until Tesla came along. They knew they'd have to risk roughly 2-5 Billion dollars to bring out a Model 3 type car, and they weren't willing to do that until they had proof that it would work. Now that someone else did the big tech advancement, they got down to what they know well, operational improvements on the process that Tesla pioneered. 

What does this all mean? With a lot of M&A, the economy as a whole is operationally more efficient but less technologically innovative. 

And our economy is setup to encourage M&A. That's because it's hard to convince a stockholder in a private company to not sell out for a 4-10x multiplier. You'd have to wait 4-10 years to see that kind of money, and most people aren't willing to wait that long. Especially after spending 5-10 years building out a company working ungodly hours. Or if the company doesn't make any profit at all. 

And what's the end goal of M&A? Basically 1-3 companies running every market sector in our economy. So we'll have a lot of ""operationally"" efficient companies. But they aren't going to do any tech innovation. So we'll be stuck with a lot of unskilled labor, paid shit, doing menial tasks. With a few white collared workers getting paid middle class wages and a tiny fraction of C-Suite execs that look at numbers all day. 

Why would they innovate if they have 30-60% market share? They already have a winning product(s) and everything is honky dory. Think Coors, Budweiser, and miller in the 60s-90s. They were the only game in town for beer. And the only way they competed with each other was in the fucking superbowl commercials. Products were shit. And everybody knew it. But they didn't care. 90% of their market was alcoholics, and they didn't care if the beer was shit. If they did anything drastic, their company would be at risk. So they didn't do shit, and just made shitty beer.

That is the future of the US economy, unless something crazy happens. A few companies running ""operationally efficient"" but with shitty products. Expect shitty movies. Expect shitty internet. Shitty beer. It won't happen overnight, but in 30 years?

63,IP," They got Marvel Studios and Star Wars IP. And exactly, they are brand new and already gaining subscribers fast. Netflix has less and less IP they can use as other companies start their own streaming services and use their own or buy IPs for them to use exclusively. What other moat does Netflix have compared to these other companies (Amazon, Disney, Apple, Google) that are also all now starting to take streaming seriously? Those other companies are also all involved in many different areas, they don't just need streaming services to survive like Netflix does. They will slowly choke Netflix out.

Will people completely stop using Netflix? No, but many have already started rotating different streaming services as one gets stale until new shows/seasons comes out. As in if there is a good show in a different platform, they will cancel their other streaming services, and only use one to watch that specific shows. Then they will rotate to the next streaming service and so on. Before when Netflix was the only giant streaming service, people didn't need to do that. But now with so many great streaming services coming, most people will not pay for most of them at the same time, they will just go rotating monthly to whichever they want to watch. 

This will big blow to Netflix because instead of having a subscriber paying every month for the whole year, they will now have subscribers who only pay 2-4 months of a year of each different streaming services.",Batboyo,6,/r/investing/comments/nli79t/amazon_will_buy_mgm_film_and_television_in_845/gzj1o1y/,0.044,0.88,0.076,0.8562
64,TV," > It's like they're trying to promote piracy at this point.

Gotta love the hot takes from redditors who think they know more about the streaming business (or any business really) than the executives who specialize in that business.

Piracy is not as much of a threat to the majority of these players anymore.  The subscription costs don't just buy you access to their content, it buys you convenience.  The convenience of having that content on any device, anytime, anywhere.  I'm sure someone will brag about how their sick plex server or whatever bullshit, but your average consumer doesn't want to deal with that nonsense.  The majority just wants to hit a button on their phone or TV remote and see the content as soon as it's available

Almost no commercials (some still do have ads). Only channels you want. You don't have to pay $20 for a package of 10 channels all cause you want the 1 main channel in the package.


Then extra perks that this created are, not just the channel, but the entire companies catalog in most cases. 

Watch what you want to watch when ever you want. No more schedule you have to follow or miss the newest episode of your favorite show. Remember when 2 shows you liked where on at the same time? Not an issue anymore.

Can cancel any service you want without interrupting service for others. Put things on rotations. You'll always have new shows when you come back and you can cut costs down to $20-$30 a month.

Torrenting will suddenly become as convenient for many (not all). The compromise being watching it on a PC/laptop without extra effort.

It really depends on the kind of user - which I'd put into 3 broad categories;

There are the ultra lazy that will just put anything semi appealing on - will probably stick to the subscriptions and add to the list over time. 

Then you've got the semi-active users that look for specific stuff, they currently have a few services and are the most likely to end up torrenting a few movies at a time because they can't find them or they're on another service they don't have/want. These are the users that are likely to fall off the edge into piracy and reduce the number of services they sub to.

Then you've got ""super users"" or ""old fashioned"" who'll have their Plex server setup tailored to their wants and needs and either torrent or rip DVD/Bluray still. These probably only share a subscription if that. This is definitely <5% of all users.

Of course those execs have probably assessed this as not a huge deal - but execs have been wrong in the past and will be wrong many times in the future.

What's to stop Netflix displaying ads? I believe they have experimented with it...

What's to stop Disney carving up the library into separate bundles over time - starts out as a way to save money, eventually prices increase to well beyond the current costs. Just a potential scenario.

Long term subscriptions too. I can see it now, pay only $5 p/m if you sign up to this 18 month contract. This feels unlikely though, monthly subscriptions seem to be almost universally preferred by the big companies at this point. Seems counter intuitive in markets where users can hop around so easily.

I'd also open storefronts/classes with brick and mortar - think joining forces with Equinox to maintain brand image - and continue being something that makes people feel good about how they look AND superior.

So I'm a huge VG bear and I have high conviction that they will go bankrupt or liquidate or sell for peanuts, but here are some possibilities:

* If you look on their website, they clearly state that 250k was for early birds and if you sign up for waitlist, you most likely won't get that price. So 1.5 mil is a lower bound on revenue per flight.
* They have 2 spaceships (Unity -- tested and Imagine -- untested) and have 2 more under construction. Burt Rutan's Xprize winner was able to relaunch in 2 weeks, it is plausible that 2 space ships can do 50 launches a year after they get the kinks out and 4 space ships can do 100 launches. Maybe more. I personally would be concerned about market size if they can get to that cadence. 100 launches per year at 2 million revenue per flight is 200 million per year. Not enough to justify current valuation and still not profitable -- especially considering that many launches will add to costs. They'll have to launch a lot more often or somehow cut costs or charge a lot more.
* Their long term pivot business plan is point to point hypersonic transit. Good luck with that. They do have an advantage with their mothership-spaceship model in that they can launch from a population center without causing sonic boom issues in populated areas -- something Starship point-to-point has an issue with. Starship has to kludge it by saying there is going to be a transfer to an offshore platform. The problem with the mothership-spaceship model is it doesn't scale to larger ships and to get good margin, you need more passengers.

Space tourism will certainly be a thing (there are already companies planning on having hotels in orbit), but most of the available 'rewards' \~right\~now\~ are the kind governments and state agencies usually reach for.  Pieces of the space travel vertical may be profitable, since the US government is leaning heavily on private companies for launch vehicles and lunar landers, but as far as products go, there really isn't much out there right now.

Eventually someone will put furnaces on the moon and convert lunar regolith into building blocks and they'll make something with them.

100,AAPL," Hi

In short, I do.  Now, do you remember what they used to say about IBM in the 1950s-1960s and their stupid computers.  IBM, MSFT, AAPL, DELL, HPQ, all of them had a huge run from the 1960s-2010s.  With that said.  SPCE, if it works will have a similar run, you are getting in on the ground level.  Need I mention TSLA 10 years ago that you would have bought at $25.   Most serious investors, unless they are in already, will not join you until later stages.  When they join, the stock will get so expensive you will pass it by and miss it. 

They have a different approach from Space X and others.  They have a plane that launches another small plane into space.  It is re-usable and can carry people to the edge of space.

107,SPCE," I've done a lot of research into the commercial space sector. I'm going to lay it too you straight: Virgin Galactic is a BS company with no real future, which is seeing stock bumps based on mostly meaningless accomplishments and (more important) the fact that people want to desperately invest in SpaceX, but can't. Virgin Galactic is the girlfriend you get when the one of your dreams isn't remotely interested in you. Except it's not a girl. It's a dog dressed in a people suit that does stupid dog tricks.

First, let's talk about business model. To date it's sold about about 600 tickets for $250,000 for what amounts to a joy ride where you experience a few minutes of weightlessness and see the curvature of the earth in a vehicle, that despite extensive testing, is far less safe than a jetliner (obviously).

Wealthy adventure seekers and influencers with deep enough pockets and tolerance of risk will go for it. How big is that market really? For comparison climbing Mount Everest, a modestly comparable ""once in a lifetime adventure"" costs about $50,000 on average. The very upper end of an Everest adventure is $150,000. An expedition also takes about two months, after months of preparation. So adventurers are getting a substantial return on their $50,000 - $150,000. A total of 800 people do it a year, including guides, or about 600 non-local climbers. 

By contrast, a Virgin Galactic flight amounts to an afternoon trip. About 3 hours, and 5 minutes of weightlessness for $250,000. Word will get out on that among those who could afford that real fast: it's a dangerous rip off, and you're better off waiting for a the real thing.

Well a Blue Origin New Shepard Flight will be significantly more substantial a suborbital experience for a (reportedly) comparable price. Furthermore in terms of ""experience factor"" (which is ultimately, what you're paying for), you experience blasting off on a rocket and landing in a capsule... way more ""adventure-y"" than taking off and landing like an airplane. I know that sounds ridiculous on its face, but folks are only buying experience, and nothing else. And the more authentic space experience? The one that blasts off like a rocket and lands like Apollo 11, or the one that is closer to a business jet?

But even New Shepard is pretty B.S. too because its experience will be both costly and short. The ROI, compared to an Everest Expedition, is still ridiculous.

Really, what people would be looking for is a two week trip to space on a Crew Dragon or Starship, the former of which are in an entirely other price bracket (for now) and the latter is years away. That, with a couple of weeks of space-training (or however long they do it for a fully private trip like that down the road), would be much more in line with the Everest model of a high-price adventure with a substantial ROI.

Virgin Galactic said that they expect $1 billion in revenue annually at their spacepot. That's a complete joke. They would have to sell 4000 tickets a year, and fly three times a day. They will not sell 4000 tickets a year. That is nearly 7 times as many people flying per year as climbing Mount Everest.  They will not fly three times a day including weekends and holidays. They have one vehicle that can fly.  Even with two more, they won't turn them around in less than 24 hours. And they won't be durable enough to fly without prolonged maintenance at that rate. That's better than even a Boeing jet.

It's a trap. It's a huge trap. I've been saying it's a trap well before meme stocks and SpaceX being substantial. Taking a step back and looking at development of the sector from a historical perspective, Virgin Galactic has been Richard Branson's non-serious flight of fancy for nearly 20 years because unlike Elon Musk, he did not have the ambition or vision to develop actual orbital spaceflight from the ground up. And that's not typical Elon bootlicking. The fact is, for folks who weren't old enough to remember, in the Early 2000s, in the wake of Columbia, a lot of private space companies started and almost none of them had the patience to actually build vehicles to go into orbit on their own. A bunch of them tried to buy surplus government hardware - old engines, vehicles and even ICBMs. A number of them also tried to do suborbital because it was supposed to be cheaper, faster and easier. That is where Virgin Galactic fell. But tell me if you've heard some of these names: Rocketplane Kistler, Excalibur Almaz, Space Transport Corporation, Mir Corp, Armadillo Aerospace,  XCOR Aerospace. Many more mostly paper companies. They all delivered big promises. They all failed. Blue Origin could have easily been one of those too, but Bezos had money to bankroll it that others didn't.

Who made it from that era?

Just SpaceX, Orbital, SNC, Blue Origin, Virgin Galactic. And of that list, Orbital and SNC's overall business long predate the commercial space era and them going commercial was more like a business shift and then too, only partial in nature (they're old Space in a new Space costume).  Blue Origin has Bezos billions and SpaceX is the only one to truly start from scratch and launch things into orbit through an extremely iterative process. Even Orbital spent years largely relying on old Russian engines and retired US ICBMs - as I said, the original private space model of using surplus government equipment to skip developing technology from scratch. Only SpaceX and Virgin Galactic did that (at first). Difference being, SpaceX aimed higher, while Virgin Galactic built shoddy vehicles, on bad times, and got people killed in the process. It's ideas of Space Travel are very 2004 too. Suborbital joy rides for the super rich? They've been stuck on that path because they decided back in 2004/2005, that orbital would be too hard. Except it wasn't, as Elon and Orbital showed, and before long, Blue Origin. And that doesn't even mention the small rocket launch companies that have popped up since then, like with the Electron rocket.

It is possible. Your space company just has to have good engineering fundamentals. And Virgin Galactic does not. 

Can you make money in the short term on Virgin Galactic? Probably. There just isn't a lot of options for people who want to invest in the commercial space industry (that isn't old Space, like Boeing or Northrop, which now owns Orbital), and our darling SpaceX just isn't interested in going public.

But in the long term?

\- Its business forecast make no sense and presumes a flight rate it'll never meet.

\- Its nearest competitor, Blue Origin, will offer a better, more authentic ""space flight"" experience and compete for the same customers and nearly the same price target.

\- Given its rate of technical development, it'll be 15 years minimum before it puts a person into space, and by then, ""Block II"" Starships with huge passenger loads will (potentially) be flying into orbit, and it'll be at a pre-Crew Dragon level of achievement. Even if it builds such a vehicle, how does it compete against Starship? It doesn't.

Does this sound like a serious space company? Does this sound like a business worth investing in? Getting SPCE as its symbol just underscores the lack of seriousness of it as a business.  It's cheap sloganeering. Yeah guys... totally SpaceX, right? Totally about space travel, right? Ridiculous.  It's a suborbital stunt flight vehicle with no future and a business that's been built on bad tech and bad promises since four years before the Falcon 1 flew the first time.

Avoid it if going long. Short, better people can give you advice for that. But long... no shot. It's bullshit. It'll always be bullshit. It was bullshit before Richard Branson got people killed for his little ego trip. It's bullshit today. It'll be bullshit three years from now when we read articles asking ""where are Virgin Galactic's customers?"".",tarn12,1,/r/investing/comments/nl3ne2/question_how_do_you_expect_virgin_galactic_to_be/gziqzs0/,0.085,0.803,0.112,0.9886
108,SPCE," For the space tourism market, a lot of it will depend on the size of the market and what the competition does. But let's just assume Virgin Galactic does 400 flights a year and work back from there.  
One UBS analyst calculated that, assuming each flight holds 6 passengers, each ticket costs $400k, and they do 400 flights a year, Virgin Galactic will make almost $1B a year in sales. If I use a lower ticket price of $250k, that gets us to $600MM in sales.  
Then we have costs. First, the engine. RocketMotorTwo, which needs to be swapped each flight, currently costs about $250k to build at current rates of production. So that works out to $100MM a year. If we assume they engines cost a third of what they do today once SPCE gets to higher production, that's $33MM a year in engine costs.   
Second, there's the vehicle itself. SPCE thinks each vehicle can sustain the wear of 50 flights a year for up to 10 years, which means that at 400 flights a year, they'll need 8 vehicles. SPCE estimates cost-per-vehicle at $30MM-$35MM. Assuming they can build each vehicle for $30MM and capitalizing the costs (depreciating over 10 years), that works out to $3MM-per-year-per-vehicle or $24MM-per-year for a fleet of 8 vehicles.  
Third, we have other operating expenses. I'd eyeball them at 50% of sales. Why? Well, if I use American Airlines' salaries and wages, they're at about 30% of revenues in some pre-COVID periods (I lazily pulled up 2018). Yes, a space company might not have baggage handlers or unions, but there will still be other highly specialized staff. Then I add an additional 20% of revenues on top for stuff like the cost of running WhiteKnightTwo, licenses, taxes, etc. So at 50% of sales, we're talking about $125k-$200k per flight or $300MM to $500MM per year.  
Putting it all together:

116,IMO," 250k for a space orbit sounds like horrible value at 125k per passenger. 

There’s a market for very high flying millionaires sure, but not a big one and most would probably rather not drop 250g (and risk their life)  to go on a space trip and float around looking out a window. It’s a once in lifetime experience key word being once. 

Clients are going to want a space walk experience for that price, I am not sure Virgin is prepared to offer that, but IMO that is by far their biggest viable upsell to ticket sales.




You could argue there’s a niche corporate / incentive travel market with real spending power that can cover the cost of a charter but—- but good luck trying to get a company to sign off on a space trip without a well established track record of safety.

123,VG," >The SpaceX business model and Virgin Galactic model are not the same at all.

They're not all that different. People in this very thread are saying hypersonic point to point travel may be VG's bread and butter once they figure out space tourism. But SpaceX has said they are looking to fo the same thing. Now let's see which is a better business model: even if VG could bring costs down substantially,  an intercontinental trip would cost around $100k to carry 6 people. SpaceX would be able to carry 100+ passengers on the same flight for less than $10k.

National space agencies and their contractors tend to try really hard to get it right the first time and not blow anything up, and that's a much slower process.

It's not really a crisis either or unexpected.  When the SLR exemptions were removed earlier this year, one of the potential issues people were concerned with was excess deposit money flooding into money market funds and pushing t-bill rates to zero or negative which is exactly what has happened.

There's a bunch of excess cash sitting around as deposits currently and not enough short term debt or overnight borrowing to put it into for money market funds and banks.  That's pushed all these rates towards zero or in some cases below.  That matters to the Fed because it impacts their target rate and  they enforce that rate through OMO, repo and reverse repo operations like this.  It should also be transitory as it's largely caused by the US treasury drawing down the TGA for the most recent round of stimulus and maybe tax refunds going out as well.

189,TM," I've been buying TM, currently up to 44 shares with a cost basis of just under $157.  

Short term (i think/hope) they will have a blow out quarter,  they are such a well run company that they said they don't expect any problems with chip shortages that are shutting down the other car manufacturers. Morningstar has them rated as a three,  but said they will reevaluate after the June numbers come out and I expect those will be good. 

Medium term,  I really don't think the infrastructure for mass adoption of pure Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV) will be in place for a lot longer than people anticipate, for example,  large number of chargers in apartment building or hotel parking lots.   Toyota has the Plug in Hybrid (PHEV) that is the perfect balance right now of a 60%-80% EV, but can go anywhere without range anxiety.   They have two models right now and more coming next year (I think).  They currently have eight regular hybrid models (all the minivans are hybrid) that look really good.   This should improve the financials even more since it's less CAFE credits to purchase making the other companies Pure BEV need to actually be profitable instead of supplemented by selling CAFE credits.  

Long term they have the scale and are working on both advanced batteries and Hydrogen and will be ready whichever becomes adopted.   They do have a pure BEV for next year,  and expect eight models by 2025 which i think is still plenty early even with optimistic assumptions about infrastructure.

197,ICE," If you believe that the world is at a tipping point with EV adoption then there is a phenomenon in disruptive innovation where overall demand for a product actually drops as you approach 30-70% penetration of the new technology.

This is fundamentally because people push back their normal upgrade cycle to wait for the new technology to meet their expectations.  When this pinch point is reached, all the big auto company’s current P/E ratios are going to be garbage in determining future profitability because those products will quickly reach zero demand.  Some will survive, some will fail, some will merge together.

So buying a legacy automaker is highly speculative because we don’t know who will emerge from the other side of this ICE demand collapse.

So their spend would go higher yield lower purchase price points for WMT.  Immediate synergies.  Also, no cannibalization of existing sales.  Walmart and Rite Aid already co-exist.  The spend that is done at Walmart at its large department stores is separate from the ""convenience"" spend that is done at local, nearby retail pharmacies.

So the result is a big net incremental gain for WMT of $24 billion in sales and $3 - $5 billion in profit.

231,TM," Tried posting this but the bot told me to post it here instead - sorry please don’t ban!!
Why are car P/E ratios generally under 10? For something that (apart from some short term sales) should always be needed, it seems like a bargain. 

Could it be that Tesla expectations of dominance are subtracting from the expected returns of these car companies? I am looking at Toyota for example, who were the early leaders in electric tech and are now focusing on a large new range of ev’s. Could TM be a great buy if I think they will catch up on the ev tech?

Lastly, with the expected switch to greener tech, any thoughts on silver? I visit r/wallstreetsilver a lot and they have me convinced that the price will explode, but I would love other investors opinions. Reasons for silver: 
Decreased supply: mined silver per year has been decreasing and it is very difficult to find silver mines (most silver is a by product from other mines). 
Increased demand: Green tech (eg solar panels and electric cars). Also increased investor focus (silver squeeze movement plus it is a traditional inflation hedge)
Silver has got a bad name due to some etfs like SLV not being backed by physical silver, but PSLV is legit (or I prefer buying it from my local coin store and keeping it in my possession)

Edit: another question: would a silver post as to my reasons for being bullish on it be welcomed on this sub? Happy to share what I’ve learnt if so",coinsrus101,1,/r/investing/comments/nlccgx/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gzi7r4x/,0.061,0.779,0.16,0.9848
232,CPA," Hey- hoping to hear some feedback/advice

I’m 23 years old, CPA, currently investing about $2,000 per month into individual stocks. Total portfolio is about $40k, made up of 28 stocks. Mostly high multiple tech (ARK stocks), but also some healthcare, big tech, and REITs for the yield. I also have a Roth that I contribute $500 per month.

I won’t need the money for 20-30+ years, and I’m comfortable holding through volatility. My focus is really just finding quality companies that will be long-term winners. My question is:

1. How many stocks is enough to be adequately diversified as the portfolio grows? I feel i could cut down to under 20 stocks and concentrate in my top holdings. 

2. I’ve been aggressively buying stocks on the way down and trimming positions on the way up. How often should I be taking profit? Does this strategy make sense long-term?

241,WKHS," > Why are car P/E ratios generally under 10?

They've been that way for a while now. Automobile manufacturing is a very competitive, capital-intensive business - there's a massive list of carmakers in the US that have gone bankrupt over the years - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_defunct_automobile_manufacturers_of_the_United_States. Aston Martin has gone bankrupt 7 times and almost was #8 last year.

Could there be some degree of multiple expansion if legacy companies succeed in EV? Possibly, but EVs don't change the fact that the automobile business is a difficult business. How many times has Tesla talked about being in distress along the way? This is an industry where few succeed, but in the last year the way that people were buying anything EV-related would suggest people thought *all* of these names were going to succeed.

People hyped up EVs to the point of a massive bubble in things like WKHS last year, which only delivered 6 trucks last quarter. A lot of the weaker/weakest EV plays have now lost well over half their value. Rob Arnott called the rise in EV stocks a ""big market delusion"": 

""A “big market delusion,” according to the paper, occurs when all the firms in an evolving industry rise together, despite that fact that they are competing against each other and only some can ultimately succeed. The trio cited airlines as a past example of an industry built around emerging technology, where “virtually every company in the business either failed or merged into a larger airline, most of which also collapsed.” (https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1qx4f8709q5nf/Big-Market-Delusion-Rob-Arnott-Attacks-Tesla-Electric-Vehicle-Industry)

Amusingly, Ark seems to now be inching towards Volkswagen the other day after acting like anything that wasn't named Tesla was a dinosaur. https://seekingalpha.com/news/3699476-ark-invest-eyes-volkswagen-as-a-potential-electric-vehicle-disruptor

""I visit r/wallstreetsilver a lot and they have me convinced that the price will explode""

Of course they think that. Weedstocks thinks weed stocks are going to the moon. So much of the silver stuff that I've seen resembles variations on precious metal bug blogs a decade ago and people are again taking up the kind of ""buying silver because of lack of confidence in the financial system"" type of theories. Personally, I dislike investing in metals/basic materials because inevitably they're a trade - mineral/material gets hyped, prices ramp and the cure for high prices is often high prices: more supply suddenly comes online, customers figure out workarounds, etc. See the rare earth bubble of several years ago, for example. People can do well with metals/minerals, but they should keep an eye on industry dynamics.",dvdmovie1,2,/r/investing/comments/nlccgx/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gzi9bik/,0.069,0.815,0.116,0.9649
242,TD," Yes. TBH your strategy is too broad and simple to work.  Consider this: if it were that easy to swing trade profitable, wouldn’t lots of amateurs be making a killing doing it?

I’m no expert, but here is some food for thought based on my learning in stocks...

1) You need a well-defined system in order to be profitable.  Your trade idea is to buy large cap stocks after they post small gains and ride the momentum until they stop moving up.  Are you talking about gains between market open and close, or do intraday gains count?  How much of a loss will you accept before cutting a bad trade?  Does there need to be a catalyst gain, or or do any old gains count.  That’s just the tip of the iceberg of what swing traders typically consider.

2) A typical trading system goes through these steps:  study, back test, trade in a simulated account, trade with very small amounts, trade full size. Beginners tend to be impatient, so they skip the prep steps and then lose their money.

3) Typical swing trading systems break the total bankroll into 10 parts (that would make your trade size $1,000 each)

4) There is a popular swing trading system called CANSLIM that I suggest you read about.  It has fairly simple rules and is popular among less experienced traders.  investors business daily has a subscription service where they give you tons of good stocks to consider with notes about how they stack up in the CANSLIM system.  It costs about $40 per month and gives you stocks to consider while teaching you the context of why they are good for swing trading.

5) you need a trading platform that can support this type of trading.  I suggest thinkorswim through TD Ameritrade

Hope this helps!

Note:  I write long answers because they help me reinforce good habits in my own trading, not because I’m a preachy weirdo...",dddumbdumbbb,2,/r/investing/comments/nlccgx/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gzjxcee/,0.062,0.764,0.175,0.9922
243,MSFT," > Is there any downsides to this strategy beyond day trading restrictions and short term capital gains tax?

It's risky, but it seems like you understand the risk. 

Why not measure yourself against a passive investor at the same time? Put say 5k into your MSFT swing trading, and put 5k into the VOO or SPY, and measure how you do against the S&P500 ETF (Historically 8% a year).",hellrazzer24,1,/r/investing/comments/nlccgx/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gzjrdxe/,0.056,0.841,0.104,0.5362
