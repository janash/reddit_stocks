34,EV," I guess the takeaway here would be a few things, right?

1. Invest in electric vehicle manufacturers in some capacity
2. Invest in the charging technologies even if that means looking at conventional gas stations who are moving into electric charging platforms.. doubly so if they provide fast charging and food/services for travelers. Who will bring that next battery station service that wins? It'll be one thing for a 30 minute fast charge (assuming tech exists), but what about 30 mins and a burger? 30 mins and putt putt golf while you wait? Dog park/food/battery charging area? Who goes for the big move and makes the charging station a ""thing""? Gas takes 2 minutes, and unless they come up with some 5-10 minute quick charge tech for all EVs, someone will realize people sitting in their cars for 30 minutes in a wasted sales opportunity and start something new.
3. Invest in the companies who build batteries or any shared EV tech

When you've done your DD and researched a company you think deserves your investment, don't question it the next week. Research the trends in value for the past 5-30 days and set purchase limits you think will give you the greatest value.

DON'T TOUCH THE LIMITS. If the stock dips lower than the limits, buy more. If it doesn't, c'est la vie. There's more stock to buy and more DD to be done.

Take CTXR for example.  I have a lot of shares and it dropped quite a bit from yesterday.

Seeing red today or anywhere before that should not affect my plan unless I see a bad catalyst directly linked to them.

Or take my mistake with SPRWF.  I bought hoping it should shoot up quick and I'd make 10% in a day.  I had an exit number if it went against me.  I exited when it hit that.  That was my plan.

192,EV," from /u/rhetorical_twix over in stocks

Stock indexes go red for a reason, and you should always be alert when it does. The market sell-off on Tuesday to Thursday was concentrated in recent high-growth stocks, across all market capitalizations. What I started to see on Thursday was a flight to value. What happened on Friday was a rotation of capital from pandemic stocks to small cap and mid cap stocks.

On Friday, as the Finviz heat map shows, we saw a sell-off in 2020's growth stocks (i.e. mega cap tech, health care and consumer defensive stocks).

The other thing the Finviz heat map shows is another move of capital into small caps and mid caps as investors take profits from large and mega caps that were pumped up by the pandemic and build more distributed portfolios. I.e. people are building new portfolios for 2021's that move away from pandemic stocks.

This is important information to pay attention to. Which is why, in my opinion, you don't ignore Red days, or complain about people you think are naive or inexperienced investors when they sit up and start asking questions or selling stocks they think have topped out to buy new stocks that they think are better going forward.

If you're not ready to take information that the Red days offer us, and update/rebalance your portfolio going forward based on that information, you're going to miss out on signals that the environment may be changing. And then you might get stuck in diminishing returns as the market moves in a different direction than the portfolio you're sitting in serves best.

IMO, the action last week suggests people who are going to sit in a 2020-inspired pandemic portfolio for all of 2021 will probably see diminishing returns.

The rotations into small and mid caps, and also from mega cap growth to value, have been taking place from time to time since the November election, and it seems to be an accelerating trend. Last week also saw a big drop in gold prices at the same time as a stiff uptick in consumer interest rates, which indicates a move away from pandemic safe havens, into higher interest and higher yield investments. The selling of gold into a consumer interest rate hike also suggests the move to value investing in the latter half of last week isn't just noise, because gold is also a hedge against inflation and has tended to go up during times of climbing interest rates.

So everyone who is bashing Red day alarmists in threads where you talk about how you got big gains in 2020 for doing nothing but investing in Apple type stocks, buying in at the March bottom or riding SPY for 100% gains, if you're not updating your portfolio for 2021 right now, you're probably underperforming the market as these sector and market cap rotations occur.

For me, last week was the week where I disengaged from a lot of EV sector investments, leaving only a few percent of my portfolio in them. And I was ready to catch the small and mid cap industrial bounce on Friday, which was a big green day for me even tho the indices were flat.

Personally, I expect these trends to small cap, mid cap and value stocks to continue throughout the Spring and I expect the money for those gains will continue to come from the mega cap tech stocks and pandemic portfolio positions that people/institutional investors are are taking profits from.

The Red days raise alarms that something is happening and that something is sometimes a change in direction. So I see the rotation out of mega cap and large cap pandemic plays and into small cap, mid cap and value + growth stocks is a trend that is firming up.

That trend is probably going to become very significant by the end of the quarter, in March, when institutional and professional investors have to rebalance their portfolios across asset classes, take profits and cut bloated positions. The shift in interest rates and asset class rotations is a significant change in investing environment. If you're still sitting in passive index ETFs or pandemic stocks, you may want to start preparing for a rebalance, too.

There will probably be more Red days like this one, particularly toward the end of March. So for many who are still sitting in pandemic portfolios, you might have a Red March if you don't start revisiting your holdings in February.",armored-dinnerjacket,17,/r/pennystocks/comments/lqf40z/what_is_going_on_today/gogjapd/,0.026,0.871,0.104,0.9944
193,IMO," from /u/rhetorical_twix over in stocks

Stock indexes go red for a reason, and you should always be alert when it does. The market sell-off on Tuesday to Thursday was concentrated in recent high-growth stocks, across all market capitalizations. What I started to see on Thursday was a flight to value. What happened on Friday was a rotation of capital from pandemic stocks to small cap and mid cap stocks.

On Friday, as the Finviz heat map shows, we saw a sell-off in 2020's growth stocks (i.e. mega cap tech, health care and consumer defensive stocks).

The other thing the Finviz heat map shows is another move of capital into small caps and mid caps as investors take profits from large and mega caps that were pumped up by the pandemic and build more distributed portfolios. I.e. people are building new portfolios for 2021's that move away from pandemic stocks.

This is important information to pay attention to. Which is why, in my opinion, you don't ignore Red days, or complain about people you think are naive or inexperienced investors when they sit up and start asking questions or selling stocks they think have topped out to buy new stocks that they think are better going forward.

If you're not ready to take information that the Red days offer us, and update/rebalance your portfolio going forward based on that information, you're going to miss out on signals that the environment may be changing. And then you might get stuck in diminishing returns as the market moves in a different direction than the portfolio you're sitting in serves best.

IMO, the action last week suggests people who are going to sit in a 2020-inspired pandemic portfolio for all of 2021 will probably see diminishing returns.

The rotations into small and mid caps, and also from mega cap growth to value, have been taking place from time to time since the November election, and it seems to be an accelerating trend. Last week also saw a big drop in gold prices at the same time as a stiff uptick in consumer interest rates, which indicates a move away from pandemic safe havens, into higher interest and higher yield investments. The selling of gold into a consumer interest rate hike also suggests the move to value investing in the latter half of last week isn't just noise, because gold is also a hedge against inflation and has tended to go up during times of climbing interest rates.

So everyone who is bashing Red day alarmists in threads where you talk about how you got big gains in 2020 for doing nothing but investing in Apple type stocks, buying in at the March bottom or riding SPY for 100% gains, if you're not updating your portfolio for 2021 right now, you're probably underperforming the market as these sector and market cap rotations occur.

216,CEO," hicago, IL, Feb. 15, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- FOMO CORP. (US OTC: ETFM) has agreed to acquire SmartGuard Energy LLC (SGE). SGE consists of the following entities: LED Funding IV LLC, d/b/a LED Funding LLC, and Lux Solutions LLC.

Management believes the acquisition of SGE, together with the recent acquisition of Independence LED Lighting (ILED - https://independenceled.com/) and the planned acquisition of EcoLite (https://www.ecoliteled.com/), enhances FOMO‚Äôs ability to provide comprehensive solutions under the anticipated smart/clean buildings initiative for Commercial, Municipal, and Federal buildings throughout the U.S. Since 2015, SGE has retrofitted and financed installations at more than 300 buildings in the U.S. and Puerto Rico where their Lighting-as-a-Service (LaaS) model was pioneered. SGE had a combined (LED Funding plus Lux Solutions) revenue of more than $3,200,000 in 2020. The value of SGE‚Äôs potential projects in 2021 is estimated to be over $13,000,000.

A letter of intent (LOI) for the planned acquisition was approved by the FOMO CORP. Board and signed by William F. Butler, CEO of SmartGuard Energy LLC, and FOMO CORP. CEO, Vik Grover, on February 12, 2021. The LOI has also been filed as an 8K with the SEC, and William Butler has agreed to serve as a member of the FOMO CORP. Advisory Board.

Said William Butler: ‚ÄúWe look forward to working with the FOMO team. We plan to derive value by leveraging our businesses synergies to accelerate growth and to create shareholder value.‚Äù

Vik Grover commented: ‚ÄúOur service platform continues to grow with the anticipated acquisition of the outstanding commercial lighting and green energy consulting businesses in SGE, which will nicely complement our ILED business and anticipated acquisition of EcoLite. We believe that SGE has attractive growth characteristics with its impressive sales funnel. LED Funding provides us with a resource to provide no-money-down financing options to our clients who are looking to slash their operating costs and their carbon footprint by converting to LED lighting and other green solutions.‚Äù

As part of the transaction, FOMO will purchase 100% of the membership interests of SGE for the following consideration, subject to adjustment based on audited results:

2,000,000 Restricted 1% Series B Preferred Shares with a market valuation of $6,000,000;
$3,000,000 cash;
$3,000,000 one-year seller note adjusted for net debt of SGE at closing, and;
For each of the three years following the closing of this planned transaction, FOMO will make an additional payment to the principals of SGE whenever the sales of SGE made at regular margins exceed an annual baseline of $13,381,047. The amount of each payment will be computed at 10% of the excess of actual sales exceeding the baseline and will be paid in equity valued at the trailing 30-day average of FOMO‚Äôs share price",ilovechainsaws460,3,/r/pennystocks/comments/lq7033/etfm_2_new_work_contracts_posted_today_one_is_a/gogcwdl/,0.015,0.867,0.118,0.9908

245,DD," SNNAF, Sienna resources is for me a 3x-4x mid summer. They are moving solely on their lithium deposit and some small news on their other claims. Their partnership with EMX royalty group should give them a huge edge in locating some deposits on their projects in Scandinavia. EMX already made a massive discovery on the Palladium One project that is beside Sienna's project so I think they pretty much know what is there. Initial sampling indicated levels up to 30x normal in their target areas so when they fire up those drills here in a couple months I think the stock could really move. I would dig into them for some DD yourself but all things are looking up from my perspective. Honestly everything that should drive them up is coming now over the next several month. Other than some sampling programs they haven't had any real news or catalysts yet. The two projects they are focusing on this spring is the Gold formation in Norway and the Platinum/ Palladium one in Finland. So much potential. EMX's goal is always to put discoveries into production as fast as they can which is good too. It will help drive them forward. I also like that they are fully cashed up so there won't be any dilution of the stock for the foreseeable future here. If they hit, they probably will see what they can generate but at that point we already have the big win.",ToastTurtle,6,/r/pennystocks/comments/lq64ue/green_strategy_to_combat_the_red_invest_in/gof8bo1/,0.007,0.899,0.094,0.9716

They've got a great board with connections to the FDA, which will help with fast tracking authorization. This will be huge in the long run!

Blackrock didn't buy ARDS because they think it's ready to moon. They bought as part of a fund that tracks the whole market. They don't give a darn about ARDS. Same story with Vanguard, they only have shares because the funds track the entire market, so they are required to buy shares.

Earnings multiplier. Based on DD, calculate the expected growth in earnings per share over a time frame. P/E x EPS (expected) = future price. But there are many other ways that analysts calculate future stock prices.
