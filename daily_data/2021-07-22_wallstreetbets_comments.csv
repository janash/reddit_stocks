37,CLOV," I was starting out daytrading and have been building up my consistency. Then came along the CLOV army and for some reason I said why not YOLO my trading account and ride this to the moon. So that's what I'm doing. It's hard going from daytrading multiple stocks to just monitoring just one stock and thinking which dip to buy to average down my position. It's hard. And I've been at it for almost 2 months with the CLOV army. The reversal yesterday really lifted my spirits. And looking at the volume that's finally coming in to buy up CLOV, I'm pretty sure that there's more price action coming and we should dig deep, really dig deep because CLOV has a lot of bag holders (paper hands) now who are ready to sell once it hits their target price. I'm diamond handing this thing because for once I wanna feel what it's like to win big. To see my portfolio rise 1000%. I want to know this feeling and tell my kids that I survived and resisted for the months to sell, when I was holding CLOV at a 60% loss but won back plenty. I know you share the same vision as me.

236,HR," Good questions! Though they're such leading questions I can't help but feel like they're not in good faith.

> Why would an acquirer pay billions to acquire a company that made under 500k last quarter? And was trading under $1 only a year ago, and whose fair value is under $3 per share by even the most aggressive valuations?

Why would revenue of the acquired company matter? The tech is what a potential acquirer would be after, not MVIS's revenue.

Also, the 'most aggressive valuation' of MVIS would be in the range of $60-$120, depending on how you view their chances of getting bought out at a price per share in that range.

> A company that can’t even manufacture its own products and whose fixed assets on their balance sheet is less than $1 million book value?

They are opening up a production line in Asia soon. (I don't remember exactly the details, but can find them if you're interested.)

> Why would this company do a share offering if they are going to be acquired soon?

One potential reason is a so-called 'breakup fee', where an acquirer wants to ensure they can get paid (by MVIS) in case an acquisition fails.

> Why would they continue hiring HR people if they are getting bought out soon?

Because until they're bought out, MVIS must continue business as usual. It would be reckless to do otherwise; if an acquisition does not go through, MVIS must keep operating as a going concern for its shareholders.

> What company would pay such a huge premium for below average quality LiDAR from a company that has zero LiDAR customers?

Well that's a leading question. MVIS long-range LIDAR is in fact *not* below average quality; it's actually best-in-class, and this is what MVIS bulls are hoping the market (and acquirers) will notice (or are currently noticing). MVIS has zero LIDAR customers because their LRL product is relatively new to the market; the A-sample was completed and shipped out for external testing only in the last three months. Why don't we take a look at EOY and see if MVIS has LIDAR customers then, eh?

> If MVIS has such valuable patents, why have they not been able to turn them into a significant source of revenue?

This, I think, is your most reasonable question. In the past I think MVIS leadership has not been effective in turning their significant patents into revenue, but the past couple years, with Sumit Sharma at the helm, have seen MVIS retargeting to their long range LIDAR product. So it is true that historically MVIS has not made revenue off their patents, but MVIS bulls speculate that their LIDAR product will bring in either large revenues or high buyout potential.

> What evidence do you have that this guy they hired is going to work with them on M&a? Sounds like that isn’t the only thing he works on.

First, Drew Markham is not a guy. She tends to get hired by companies only for a few months, to finalize M&A processes. It's not 100% correlation, of course, but it just adds to the MVIS bull case.

This tells me two things:

1) When have you ever heard of an employee being compensated in July? Bonuses go at the end of year. This makes me think a buyout as pretty imminent and this was a thank you for the hard work.

2) ATM programs can be put in place relatively quickly and finalize quickly. I think MVIS did this to increase their balance sheet, making them more competitive price wise in terms.

MVIS got a $14M development fee, and $10M upfront loan to develop their tech for the HL2. They got the development fee. Then they signed a new deal with MSFT in March 2020 to move physical production of the tech to MSFT, and in return they get royalties for an unspecified amount for each unit sold. So they aren't involved at all anymore other than receiving a royalty payment each time a HL2 is sold. 

Unfortunately, they have to subtract any royalty payments from the upfront $10M. They've done about 2.5M of this, and expect to do another 2.5M this year (2021), though they only did \~480k in Q1. So they have to wait another \~2 years or longer to get any royalty revenue from the HL2, it's just all going to the 10M upfront loan.

Ideally all the regulatory negative sentiment will be out of the window, VIE structure gets officially approved (or status quo continues), and BABA along with Chinese tech stock will resume printing. 

At some point the risk/reward will be simply too good and investors will toss their money back into the sector.

473,CLOV," I was starting out daytrading and have been building up my consistency. Then came along the CLOV army and for some reason I said why not YOLO my trading account and ride this to the moon. So that's what I'm doing. It's hard going from daytrading multiple stocks to just monitoring just one stock and thinking which dip to buy to average down my position. It's hard. And I've been at it for almost 2 months with the CLOV army. The reversal yesterday really lifted my spirits. And looking at the volume that's finally coming in to buy up CLOV, I'm pretty sure that there's more price action coming and we should dig deep, really dig deep because CLOV has a lot of bag holders (paper hands) now who are ready to sell once it hits their target price. I'm diamond handing this thing because for once I wanna feel what it's like to win big. To see my portfolio rise 1000%. I want to know this feeling and tell my kids that I survived and resisted for the months to sell, when I was holding CLOV at a 60% loss but won back plenty. I know you share the same vision as me. So don't paper hand. Let this CLOV ride to the triples and let's all go to the moon.",justbemenooneelse,26,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/opasr1/daily_popular_tickers_thread_for_july_22_2021/h65goya/,0.041,0.845,0.114,0.9293

All the DD is intact.  I wish their upper management would be more aggressive with their buyback though..  It just needs a bit of institutional interest so they can kill each other on their spread schemes.

The good things is that they are mostly losing the money to each other.  Nothing is really changing, except their market cap and the current price point.

667,ADSK," I disagree …respectfully. Forget stop losses and short term thinking. I have just 2 steps to success in options:

1. Buy options - but only, I repeat only when Bloomberg officially announces that we’re in a recession - officially per definition. By then we’ve already been in a recession for a few months. 
Exception - when something unusual happens to an individual company you’ve been following for 10 years, like say BABA being so cheap, or ADSK having an implied volatility in the 20s while they’re set for immense growth. 

2. Only buy calls, only 2year OTM LEAPS. Buy half or third position. 100% percent guaranteed that the value of your options will be down about 50% shortly after you buy, this is my guarantee. When that happens buy the second half of the position for half the price. It might go down again, you could then double down or just wait. It won’t matter in 2 years.

There is just one more thing - and this is the most important of all. Only buy for a company that you’ve been following for 5 or 10 years, and only a company not susceptible to new tech disruption and in a market  that it dominates by 30% or more so not susceptible to competition, with a competitive advantage stronger than carbide and a competitive advantage that no one knows about fully. During the course of a decade there will be an amazing deal in plain sight and it will go unnoticed for months to a year. You can then feel confident to keep doubling down because their earnings and revenues are growing double digit. You will really feel the pain in options when price falls. But with this approach you will instead be filled with excitement when the price falls because to you it’s just marked down on sale. Because as it posts double digit growth, the price action won’t matter.

The trick becomes finding something to invest in along side them that is negatively correlated but also has growth potential to become a sort of store for gains/slush fund for dips.

Its really the last of the publicly traded deep sea drillers.  I think they're picking up assets on the cheap and new contracts but they're still trading like they're gonna bk.

There was a substantial build in positive gamma which brings our estimated max move to just 71bbps/31pts for today. 4350 is large support with 4376 the next level overhead. 4400 is the top end of our range into Fridays close.""*

*""Implied volatility (i.e. VIX) has now been crushed, and its likely realized will drop sharply now, too. This will further pressure implied volatility and keep pressure on markets to shift higher. Below is a snapshot of our compression model, which is simply measures how large the intraday high/low range is.""*

*""We’ve talked about the compression of trading ranges into OPEX, and the expansion in the week after. As you can see by the circled area we are coming off of a large trading range and anticipate markets “re-compress” as it shifts to the high gamma area of 4375-4400.""*

Chart:  https://imgur.com/gallery/WOq1oEz

*""Compression = tight trading ranges = pressure on implied volatility = markets higher.""*

*""If markets chose to slide lower today, we see an inflection point at 4335 with very little reason to look for downside further than that. The gamma flip lines have shifted down to 4300, but substantial OI remains in the 4200-4300 which indicates support underneath.""*

Everyone will take the share fraction. Downside will be that it’s going to be at whatever the table says it will be in the S1 or whatever it is. You should basically come out even.

So even though earnings were just barely missed his reassessment comments spooked people in an already spooked market.

1040,AMC," I've been long on Cinemark pre-covid.

Before and even during Covid they invested a lot into upgrading theaters (great time to do it when people aren't there anyway).
