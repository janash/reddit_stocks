1,FREQ," I put a few thousand into FREQ, because I have tinnitus and am worried about further hearing loss.

Then they dropped 75% the next week when their product trial showed no significant improvement to hearing upon multiple applications. So, even though I invested in hopes of them changing the world, they may not. 

Still hoping they figure it out. Not for my portfolio’s sake, but for my ears’.",flyover,193,/r/investing/comments/ofruwg/what_companies_did_you_invest_in_because_you/h4el3je/,0.095,0.828,0.077,-0.0557

5,SNES," SNES. Senestech has a single product in Contrapest, an oral contraceptive for rats. I invested in them not because they are a good stock play (they aren't, have shed 99% of valuation over the last 5 years, and might go bankrupt in any given quarter), but because I really want to see them succeed.

The contraceptive approach has shown significant impact in agricultural and major urban  test environments and avoids moral and environmental issues of adverse impact on other animal populations and animal cruelty. As far as the rats are concerned, they get some tasty treats and live out the rest of their natural life without reproducing.

As we further concentrate into major cities and as states follow California's lead in limiting rat poison use, I think widespread adoption of Senestech's product could make a tremendous impact on controlling rat populations, food spoilage, and the spread of disease. Whether adoption occurs before bankruptcy is another question though.",DeliciousTea,50,/r/investing/comments/ofruwg/what_companies_did_you_invest_in_because_you/h4eqiqf/,0.103,0.808,0.089,-0.6609

14,CBD," Since there has been no mention of the US Based cannabis industry, I’d like to introduce [**$MSOS**](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSOS?p=MSOS)

Consider how useful hemp is in terms of fibres and plastics, as well as CBD, CBN, THC, etc, the potential treatments and medicine, not to mention the recreational use which will probably blow everything else out of the water and seriously disrupt alcohol. Alcohol sales in the US alone was over $250,000,000,000 (2019). [**Weed tax in Illinois**](https://www.google.ca/amp/s/www.greenentrepreneur.com/amphtml/370598) is already **eclipsing booze tax**, and most states are very much in need of tax revenue that could very well go towards crumbling infrastructure. A lot of Americans don’t even have access to clean drinking water.

As cannabis moves from the illicit market to the highly regulated and safer licit market, a whole new industry comes to life. A new source of tax revenue can surge literally overnight. All it takes is some lawmakers to vote in favour and sign it into law. Not to mention all the jobs that are being created and the additional income tax earned from grow ops that become legit.

Currently, 19 states have legalized recreational use marijuana. NY has just signed it into law (comes into effect in possibly more than a year from now) as well as NJ, whom will likely start sales this fall. Imagine how many of NYC’s 8,500,000 residents will want to cross the river to NJ… sales are growing briskly in all markets. NYC alone is the world’s biggest cannabis market.

But this company started by the late great ""Alfred Mann,"" known for his humanitarian visions for ""mankind,"" has literally changed the lives of so many people around the world with Type 1 & Type 2 Diabetes. He never lived to see the ever growing acceptance of his drug called ""Afrezza."" Afrezza is a white dry powdered inhaled insulin that is inserted into a little plastic whistle looking device that transports the insulin into your mouth. This fast acting insulin stabilizes a diabetics' blood sugar levels rapidly. More so than any other injectable insulin on the market. And Afrezza is the ONLY inhalable dry product insulin on the market, as well as,  with their patent that extends well past our lifetimes. So what's not to like? Ask the shorts! And then Go Figure!! I suppose shorts find reasons to hate a company so they short it. Some don't hate the product, they hate the management of the company. And then there are mostly those on that side of the trade that short any given stock simply to follow the heard because some influential Hedge Fund, etc., has found a tiny chink in the armor and traders pile on for no good reason without even doing their own research, for example. But whatever the reason(s), MNKD will have it's day! And when it does, it won't need any memes' play to project it to where it should have been years ago...

119,SOL," I work with a lot of satellite signal equipment.
The biggest issue with trying to get lots of ""bandwidth"" within satellite services is water, we call it ""rain fade"". Basically, you can get better and more robust signal at lower frequencies, but have a less medium to work with when sending data through.
At higher frequencies, water (rain/clouds) tend to interfere with the signal, but you can push more data through. But it's not as reliable. If you're using Ka band, and it starts raining, you're SOL.
So it's generally a give and take. Usually the answer is a better modem, what basically translates your signal to usable data. Certain equipment allows for more efficient symbol translation (Qualcomm has a good handle on this). As well as finding the best band for the mission/task. Better transceivers and receivers help too ofc. But it's hard to package solid sat lock into a phone, I'm curious on how they got around it.

Anyways, here's a good article: https://www.esa.int/Applications/Telecommunications_Integrated_Applications/Satellite_frequency_bands

135,AI," I couldn't agree more.

People don't appreciate Tesla's level of vertical integration in my opinion.

Amazon's cash cow, AWS was invented out of necessity to provide their services.

Tesla keeps creating solutions for their own problems which few have the capital and concentration of expertise and execution power to achieve.

For example, they're building out enormous computing power in their Dojo project to train their AI which once online could be offered as a service.

They needed specialty processing for full self-driving so they developed their own silicon.

They make their own seats in-house.  Most automotive companies use suppliers for this and other major parts of the car.  To me, if Tesla is an automotive manufacturer, then other companies are just assemblers.        

They need more battery capacity so they're building out their own infrastructure to supplement suppliers.

When faced with a problem, they don't just try to throw money at it, they invent solutions in-house and capture that value.",rockguitardude,24,/r/investing/comments/ofruwg/what_companies_did_you_invest_in_because_you/h4en3q8/,0.06,0.891,0.048,-0.4645

178,SOFI," The main point of differentiation is the fact that it’s all online, which drives down OpEx dramatically due to not having to run branches (cost of real estate and staff). That’s the obvious bit, but if you look at their offerings as a whole, everything is either on-par or better than what a traditional bank offers. 2% credit card is on-par, their loan rates are typically better, they offer free Robo-Investing, all 3 basic types of investing accounts (Ind. and both IRAs). If they manage to start offering HSAs as well, they’ll lap even most traditional brokerages). 

Their “checking” account offers actual interest on your spending cash. 

They embrace crypto. This is big and will be bigger if and when they manage to combine this with IRAs. I’d kill for the ability to buy just 1 BTC in my Roth right now.

Then there’s Anthony Noto, who’s essentially the perfect CEO for this company.

Galileo makes it so that SOFI has some control over what most other FinTechs can achieve. They control their payment processing.

I’ve been a customer since 2019 and have had nothing but good experiences. Just an overall great company that still has a lot of room to grow. That last bit is the reason I have such high conviction on this stock. In this market so many things are fully priced already, but SOFI still has room to run.

They are innovating in many ways that other manufacturers can’t compete with such as improved best in class HVAC systems that have very little range impact.

But let’s step away from cars for a second. I think Tesla will be the biggest company in the world in 2040. 

They will make full home HVAC systems, replace natural gas as a heating fuel across North America, and provide and introduce low cost efficient HVAC for india.

They will be the worlds state of the art battery production company, and will expand into electric airliners in the mid to late 2030s.

They will begin to offer modular carbon nuetral housing that comes with Tesla power walls, solar roofs, passive house certifications, whole house hyper-efficient HVAC with HEPA filtering.

Tesla is overvalued by every metric and common sense.  However you cannot put a price on a brilliant Chairman who can move markets with a simple tweet.

A lot of the hype is centered around full self driving being a thing and Tesla being the leader in fully autonomous driving. Full self driving is a week away every other week.. for years now. At what point does the user base accept reality?  Plenty of complaints from owners that they can’t transfer the FSD purchase to future models - so is it a software license purchase, or hardware?  When does that lawsuit come to fruition?  When do governments clamp down on the use of self driving and it’s limitations?

Here’s the thing - how much has been priced into the stock where FSD fails to be a complete product?  What if it’s never fully self driving like we’ve been led on to believe?  *what if customers don’t actually want a car that drives itself because they don’t like nanny tech?* - how much of that has been priced in?

Is it a car company?
Is it a tech company?
Is it a energy company?
Is it a battery supply company?

Here’s the thing tho.. if anyone questions the above and the stock tanks, elon simply tweets out “so excited to work on our new, mid-sized pick up truck or convertible model 3.. expected soon!”  And the stock doubles in a few days - wiping out the shorts.

That’s Tesla and Elon magic in a nutshell.”


“I agree with you that self driving tools are *helpful*, but I question the ambitions and real world practically of *full* self driving.

Problem is, even when there’s this big gaping hole of mis-pricing, as a fund manager you can’t take advantage of the opportunity because if the short-market moves against Tesla, a simple Tweet from Elon will move it right back and wipe you out - even if it’s 100% bullshit.”",Hutz_Lionel,11,/r/investing/comments/ofr9xw/are_permabears_delusional/h4ei08m/,0.037,0.899,0.064,0.8119

At what point does the user base accept reality?  Plenty of complaints from owners that they can’t transfer the FSD purchase to future models - so is it a software license purchase, or hardware?  When does that lawsuit come to fruition?  When do governments clamp down on the use of self driving and it’s limitations?

Here’s the thing - how much has been priced into the stock where FSD fails to be a complete product?  What if it’s never fully self driving like we’ve been led on to believe?  *what if customers don’t actually want a car that drives itself because they don’t like nanny tech?* - how much of that has been priced in?

Is it a car company?
Is it a tech company?
Is it a energy company?
Is it a battery supply company?

Here’s the thing tho.. if anyone questions the above and the stock tanks, elon simply tweets out “so excited to work on our new, mid-sized pick up truck or convertible model 3.. expected soon!”  And the stock doubles in a few days - wiping out the shorts.

That’s Tesla and Elon magic in a nutshell.”


“I agree with you that self driving tools are *helpful*, but I question the ambitions and real world practically of *full* self driving.

Tesla has been pushing a narrative of being at the cusp of full self driving for years - Elon himself has been pumping the idea of FSD being ready for years now. Oct 2016: https://www.tesla.com/blog/all-tesla-cars-being-produced-now-have-full-self-driving-hardware

Meanwhile in the real world, drivers (including myself) *are turning off autonomous features* : https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/27/drivers-turning-off-annoying-or-bothersome-vehicle-safety-systems.html

Nowhere am I insinuating that self driving is not useful or welcome, but rather to what degree?


Problem is, even when there’s this big gaping hole of mis-pricing, as a fund manager you can’t take advantage of the opportunity because if the short-market moves against Tesla, a simple Tweet from Elon will move it right back and wipe you out - even if it’s 100% bullshit.”",Hutz_Lionel,11,/r/investing/comments/ofr9xw/are_permabears_delusional/h4ei08m/,0.037,0.899,0.064,0.8119

1. You have a portfolio of only tech stocks. Tech has done exceedingly well over the last decade, but there were rotations during that period out of tech and considerable pullbacks at times. There's no diversification - you're reliant on one sector.  You have to be okay with the idea that you're going to underperform at times if you're going to be all tech, not to mention the volatility of growth names.

2.  ""and there seems to be no reason why they would do bad in the future."" The issue with tech is that everyone thinks this way. Tech is certainly a big part of everyday life - and a bigger part of everyday life ahead - but are you going to find an investor that doesn't think that way? Probably not. There is the possibility that tech isn't the same degree of leadership in the future. And really, I'm not into making decade long predictions, but could tech underperform over the next year or so? I don't think it's unreasonable given how insane the performance of aggressive growth broadly was last year.

3. ""As everyone already noticed, today these stock dropped and it made me build-up some anxiety."" You have to invest beyond the ultra short term. Stocks aren't going to go up every day or every week or every month and sometimes they're going to have a not a great year. If you aren't actively trading (which is not something I'd really recommend), then you have to look beyond the ultra short-term.

4. ""How risky is holding stocks like these?"" These are growth stocks - there is going to be real volatility at times. Look at something like NVDA - that has had tremendous upside momentum in the last month or so and is definitely technically overbought. But in Feb when there was a major rotation out of growth that lost about 25% in less than a month.  Again, as noted above too, you have all tech/no diversification. 

5. ""why they would do bad in the future (except for a complete market crash)"" There are certainly market corrections at times and that doesn't mean that the fundamentals have necessarily changed, it's just the reality of stocks don't go up every day - and there will be days like today where the futures are down 500 points. If you are considering selling because of a down day, then the issue is that your view of investing is not realistic. There's going to be down days, down weeks, down months at times.",dvdmovie1,11,/r/investing/comments/og3fqi/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/h4gkskm/,0.071,0.842,0.087,0.7271

276,NVDA," No worries! Just didn't want you to have the wrong set of expectations.

So stocks are broadly categorized into two categories based on their price. 

- A highly priced stock is called a ""growth"" stock because it is expected to greatly grow revenue and earnings in the future. You pay a higher price compared to the stock's current earnings/share because the earnings are expected to be higher in the future than they are today. If growth exceeds expectations when you bought it, the stock will rise in price. If growth fails to meet those expectations, it will fall in price. Growth stocks tend to trade at 40x earnings or more. NVDA trades at 80x earnings (at current earnings assuming no growth, it will take you 80 years to make your money back).

- A moderately (or low) priced stock is called a ""value"" stock because it is expected to keep to moderately grow revenue and earnings in the future, or stay the same. You pay a lower price compared to the stock's current earnings/share. This stock is somewhat safer because you are paying less for what the company earns, but it has less ""upside"" because it likely won't significantly grow those earnings. These companies tend to trade around 15-20x earnings. (The entire stock market is currently averaging around 20x earnings, for reference)

NVDA is a staple growth tech company, but this type of company has some inherent risks that if growth expectations don't come to fruition, the company will dramatically drop in value.",WeenisWrinkle,1,/r/investing/comments/og3fqi/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/h4hcmb9/,0.075,0.854,0.072,0.5697
