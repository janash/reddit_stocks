5,TBI," They increased the actual rate on the facility to 5 bps too.  People are flipping out over nothing as usual though, this whole thing has just been the Fed moving in to put a 5 bps floor on short term credit rates after things briefly traded negative and T-bill rates got very close to zero.

If banks or anyone else needs cash they're free to borrow it for next to nothing instead of nothing or use some of those reserve balances they've got sitting around to actually settle up with the treasury.  Or the Fed can just reduce the size of its facility here.  Like there's a million options here that don't end in disaster which is pretty common for Pozsar's commentary most of the time.

6,GME," I tried to pay attention to the video, he never really talked about Dodd-Frank I think. And this has nothing to do with GME. Cash has been going up since July 2020 even after the big spike post initial Covid crash:

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CASACBW027SBOG

There's no visible spike in April.

The true problem has been a lack of supply of short term T-Bills in the last couple of months because of the excess cash that has been built up because of the FED covid response and the Treasury issuing less amount of T-Bills compared to last year.

https://www.investmentnews.com/t-bills-shortage-to-worsen-189939

Reverse Repo started going up when the T-Bill short term rate went to almost 0:

https://ycharts.com/indicators/1_month_treasury_rate

This made the 0% rate reverse repo a perfect substitute. Look how it goes up to 0.05% when the RRP rate is changed to 0.05%. Increasing the RRP to 0.05% was a way to avoid going to negative rates.

This, of course isn't viable, but the point is that a lot of traders under-research and then make emotion-based purchase/sale based on short-term trends.   


If you are confident that your picks will succeed in the long run, don't lock in a loss on a short term dip.

15,IBM, I've invested in some companies for years before dumping them. I think I was in IBM for almost 4 years. I've since moved a larger portion to s&p index funds.

16,TSLA," People are pointing out the market is up and your picks are down. Money has been moving out of growth into value stocks. Those are the big ones in index funds. More stable but less potential for growth.

So it’s possible your picks are good and it’s just a down time right now. If so, this is your chance to buy more. Example: January my TSLA was at a $900 all time high. It’s been down ~30% ever since. Am I selling? Heck no. It helps that I bought below the current price so I still feel “in the green” but regardless I have a 10 year valuation in mind so anything below that is just a blowout sale.

Now I’m not necessarily saying double down. You’re new so you might have made bad picks. Why do you believe in the companies? To be a worthy investment you should see all the following:

* You love their products and others do too. They actually provide value that other companies do not (and preferably cannot).

* You have evaluated their financial situation and projected future financials and believe it justifies a significantly higher valuation in the future.

* You believe the market currently undervalues the company so you have a good buying opportunity.

* You really understand the fundamentals of the business and still believe in it long term.

If all those were true when you bought, just ask if any of the recent news makes a long term difference to your thesis. If so, you need to reevaluate. If not, the day traders have put their shares on sale for you in their mad attempt to show quarterly profits.

As others are saying you may need to step back to more stable investments if low diversification is freaking you out. But if you do your homework you can mitigate the risk, put yourself in a confident mindset, and long term reap greater rewards than an index fund.

Oh, and if you believe in a company’s future I know of no strategy to predict short term market bottoms. Others say buy low sell high. I say buy regularly and when on sale. Sell literally nothing for 10 years as long as my thesis remains intact.",Good_Reaction_2247,1,/r/investing/comments/og5a4e/when_do_you_decide_to_cut_your_losses/h4iixf7/,0.063,0.778,0.159,0.9907
17,ENPH," It's hard to say what the best approach for you would be, but I will say that it's good to remember that you never actually take a loss (or a gain) until you sell.

If you think you picked good stocks, and think the value will increase over the time you plan to own them, a dip in cost is a reason to buy more.

But, if you need access to the capital in the short term, or if you start to think the money (no matter how much the stock you bought has dropped in value) will grow faster somewhere else, you'll want to switch.

Honestly, data shows it's very hard to beat the market as an investor, and index funds are probably the best growth strategy for most people. Anytime you're picking individual stocks, you're taking a bigger risk than you would with an index fun. The reason to take that risk is that you have convinced yourself it will outperform the market.

And - that happens sometimes. Like, I have a small handful of SEDG shares that I bought at about $45, and they're now worth $265. Of course, they were also pricing over $350 a while back, so if I bought them then, I'd have them showing as a ""loss"" right now. Same for ENPH, I have a handful of shared purchased at $18-19, now worth about $180. But, I also have a handful of investments where I bought a stock for more than I could sell it for right now. And some of those, I have bailed on - while they might climb back out of the ditch over time, if I can put my money on another rocket launching sooner and flying higher, I will.

Again, however, I think it's important to recognize all of this is basically gambling, and I tend to keep most of my investments in index funds like CISIX, FSKAX, and VOO.

EDITED TO ADD: I want to emphasize the word ""handful"" of shares with my individual stock picks. With both the wins and losses above, I'm talking about initial investments of under $500, with the ""wins"" now worth a few thousand. My goal is to keep 70-90% of my investments in index funds.",ToojMajal,1,/r/investing/comments/og5a4e/when_do_you_decide_to_cut_your_losses/h4hjlk1/,0.029,0.788,0.183,0.9959

19,PT," Some example of the companies would be helpful, BUT you should have decided on where to cut your losses BEFORE getting into the stock!

Number one rule before investing or trading is to have a plan.  The plan provides a list of stocks you have researched and want to trade/own.  Then the plan provides where and how you want to enter a position.  The plan also (very important part many people forget about) provides a detailed exit strategy.

I have multiple accounts and some are trading but some are investment style.  Even my investment accounts I treat like a trading account but in slow motion.  I will only enter a stock on my stock list, I will enter on a down day (I also have a number of other criteria and indicators) and if I get into the stock, I immediately set up the exit.  My investment accounts don't always have a PT (profit target) exit as these are stocks I'm fine to hold for years and collect dividends.  However they will all have a stop loss of some sort in place so I always limit my loss.  Many are a trailing stop so that it also protects my profits as the stock climbs.  Sure at times I get taken out, but I just wait for an opportunity and get back in to that same stock later, or something else.

Sorry... that ended up longer than planned.  But trading/investing is a complicated job that requires a lot of study and work if you want to do it for any length of time.

57,NVDA," A few thoughts:

1. You have a portfolio of only tech stocks. Tech has done exceedingly well over the last decade, but there were rotations during that period out of tech and considerable pullbacks at times. There's no diversification - you're reliant on one sector.  You have to be okay with the idea that you're going to underperform at times if you're going to be all tech, not to mention the volatility of growth names.

2.  ""and there seems to be no reason why they would do bad in the future."" The issue with tech is that everyone thinks this way. Tech is certainly a big part of everyday life - and a bigger part of everyday life ahead - but are you going to find an investor that doesn't think that way? Probably not. There is the possibility that tech isn't the same degree of leadership in the future. And really, I'm not into making decade long predictions, but could tech underperform over the next year or so? I don't think it's unreasonable given how insane the performance of aggressive growth broadly was last year.

3. ""As everyone already noticed, today these stock dropped and it made me build-up some anxiety."" You have to invest beyond the ultra short term. Stocks aren't going to go up every day or every week or every month and sometimes they're going to have a not a great year. If you aren't actively trading (which is not something I'd really recommend), then you have to look beyond the ultra short-term.

4. ""How risky is holding stocks like these?"" These are growth stocks - there is going to be real volatility at times. Look at something like NVDA - that has had tremendous upside momentum in the last month or so and is definitely technically overbought. But in Feb when there was a major rotation out of growth that lost about 25% in less than a month.  Again, as noted above too, you have all tech/no diversification. 

5. ""why they would do bad in the future (except for a complete market crash)"" There are certainly market corrections at times and that doesn't mean that the fundamentals have necessarily changed, it's just the reality of stocks don't go up every day - and there will be days like today where the futures are down 500 points. If you are considering selling because of a down day, then the issue is that your view of investing is not realistic. There's going to be down days, down weeks, down months at times.",dvdmovie1,11,/r/investing/comments/og3fqi/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/h4gkskm/,0.071,0.842,0.087,0.7271

71,NVDA," No worries! Just didn't want you to have the wrong set of expectations.

So stocks are broadly categorized into two categories based on their price. 

- A highly priced stock is called a ""growth"" stock because it is expected to greatly grow revenue and earnings in the future. You pay a higher price compared to the stock's current earnings/share because the earnings are expected to be higher in the future than they are today. If growth exceeds expectations when you bought it, the stock will rise in price. If growth fails to meet those expectations, it will fall in price. Growth stocks tend to trade at 40x earnings or more. NVDA trades at 80x earnings (at current earnings assuming no growth, it will take you 80 years to make your money back).

- A moderately (or low) priced stock is called a ""value"" stock because it is expected to keep to moderately grow revenue and earnings in the future, or stay the same. You pay a lower price compared to the stock's current earnings/share. This stock is somewhat safer because you are paying less for what the company earns, but it has less ""upside"" because it likely won't significantly grow those earnings. These companies tend to trade around 15-20x earnings. (The entire stock market is currently averaging around 20x earnings, for reference)

NVDA is a staple growth tech company, but this type of company has some inherent risks that if growth expectations don't come to fruition, the company will dramatically drop in value.",WeenisWrinkle,1,/r/investing/comments/og3fqi/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/h4hcmb9/,0.075,0.854,0.072,0.5697
72,BOE," The FED, ECB and BOE all have quantitative easing programs: they buy long term low risk debt, like government bonds, to stimulate investments. This way they increasing the money supply in order to avoid lowering interest rates. It's unclear at what point lowering interest rates becomes counterproductive, but I don't think interest rates below -1% are realistic.

The main objective for central banks and monetary policy is to maintain price stability. The economy is managed by governments through fiscal policy. Your assumption the no 1 solution to fight a recession therefore is incorrect: central banks don't fight recessions, governments do. Low interest rates/quantitative easing increases governments ability to stimulate the economy by lowering financing costs, but they're not meant to fight a recession (in theory).",iminfornow,6,/r/investing/comments/ogd8ne/hypothetical_interest_rates_in_recession/h4ide6w/,0.23,0.598,0.173,-0.7935
73,GDP," The stock market and the economy are 2 separate (albeit related) things. Just because stocks are flying and the bubble might burst doesn't mean its a recession or potential recession. Recession is based on negative GDP growth and currently the majority of major economies are seeing growth in GDP following vaccine rollout and the easing of the pandemic.

The Fed also aren't mandated to protect the stock market despite what many people seem to think. The job of the Fed (and most other central banks) is to support economic growth with low unemployment and stable prices.

Climate change is certainly a threat to everyones long term growth and wellbeing, but the impact of climate change is likely to kick in over a long period and not be one sudden shock to the system causing a recession.",Evandinho,4,/r/investing/comments/ogd8ne/hypothetical_interest_rates_in_recession/h4ile0q/,0.101,0.763,0.136,0.3045
74,GDP," You were right 20 years ago. 

Markets-Economy dichotomy has been around for so long that everyone is ready to parrot that statement without losing a beat. 

I would day right now the correlation  between both is about 1, ie, markets down will bring down the economy but the opposite is not necessarily true, as we saw from the previous year. 

The reason  I'm right is very simple,
BlackRock, Vanguard, 2204 different ETFs and about 180 sovereign pension funds all working relentlessly pouring capital from the economy into the market. 

Because markets do crush once in a while, and as of right now, too many people depend on healthy savings they accumulated over the last 40 years,  markets go down means savings go down which means boomers will either have to sell assets, housing crush, or go back to the labor force which will create it's own set of problems. 

GDP is also artificially inflated, once the above happens, there will be much less spending, investing and to prevent a revolution the government won't hike taxes so there will be less government spending, at least at first.",glimpus,1,/r/investing/comments/ogd8ne/hypothetical_interest_rates_in_recession/h4iq6tk/,0.053,0.882,0.065,0.1012

87,CSCO," Congrats on getting going early! Your self reported risk tolerance is too low for individual stocks, especially high beta stocks.  On the other hand a lot of people at your age don't have a good way to measure their risk tolerance.   So I am taking your risk tolerance with a grain of salt.  Also, since you are young, I would start building a core portfolio (you don't have to change what you have now) out of new cash in a backbone ETF pair like SCHB/SCHF.  This will give you diversification and better risk adjusted return.  It can be added to and rebalanced annually.

With your individual stocks you absolutely have to manage them.  You can't fire and forget.  You should be building your own annual valuations for them with a new price target at least at every quarterly report.  If they have significant appreciation available (room to grow to your price target) they are a ""buy""... if they don't have much they are a hold... and if they get to or over price target, sell and move on to the next thing.   You should resolve your buy/hold/sell decisions to your own price targets.  Just because you think a company will be here for you in 30 years doesn't mean they will, and even if they are, they may not be good investments over that time frame.  as an example, everybody was buying CSCO in 2000.

92,STEM," I read an article showing that the best investors with the best gains were either:

1. Dead
2. Forgot their account existed

You can do it the hard way or the easy way. The easy way is just keeping buying the S&P 500. Set it and forget it.

The best college preparation for the investment world is the degree which will give you the job with the most income (ie STEM) -- with you being able to tolerate the profession.

Because imo, money generated from income is most of the battle. If you have a job that pays you pennies, you're going to spend a long time making practically nothing as opposed to if you have a job that pays well - it's a whole lot easier to invest and get massive gains.

And often what pays well is STEM.

Especially if you're going with a loan, get a degree that you know you can easily pay the money back and more. And a degree in Philosophy for like 90% of people means you'll probably be having a tough time finding a job. What's the point of paying hundreds of thousands of dollars for a degree where you're jobless? As opposed to much more highly coveted degrees and professions. Not all degrees are created equal. Some pay you a whole lot more and Philosophy isn't it.",Dracomies,1,/r/investing/comments/og2vi2/discussion_on_the_best_education_to_be_a_better/h4iakc0/,0.06,0.788,0.152,0.973
93,AAPL," I really only see 3 reasons to trim positions:

1. If the holding is becoming a large majority of your portfolio. If AAPL is like 50% or more then yes you should trim to diversify.

2. If the holding has changed fundamentally. If AAPL suddenly goes from selling iPhones to manufacturing chemicals or building fighter jets, then yes, trim or sell all immediately. 

3. If the holding is built purely from momentum and FOMO. i.e., those meme stocks, but that doesn't apply to AAPL. 

Otherwise, buying, adding and holding (until condition 1 or 2 are met as state above) a fundamentally strong giant like AAPl is always better than constantly rebalancing.",BussySlayer69,27,/r/investing/comments/ogbnx6/thoughts_on_trimming_positions/h4hx5oe/,0.0,0.841,0.159,0.9484

I think this is a stock by stock decision.  AAPL has been already consolidating, so I would not sell that.  If you do want to sell I normally do what I call half off, I take half off when the market is going up real fast (high RSI), then wait for a pullback to lower RSI levels.

They took on a whole lot of debt and/or diluted the previous shares of the company to survive the last 15 months. So even when they are back to pre-pandemic footing in terms of income and operations, the shares won't quite as valuable for awhile.

DAL nearly tripled their long-term debt and doubled their overall liabilities so far. So even when revenue and profits fully recover, they have more debt to content with going into the future.

AAL didn't increase quite this much, but they increased the amount of shares outstanding quite a bit, which dilutes ownership from previous stock holders. So even with AAL has recovered financially, they have more shares out there splitting it.

 However, AAL raised over $2 billion in cash in issuing new stock to survive this. (They were on worse financial footing going into this)
