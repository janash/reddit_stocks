2,ALL," SHORT LADDER ATTACK INCOMING HOLD HOLD HOLD UPVOTE AND SHARE

In the last hour of trading some of us are predicting they will launch a short ladder attack to make it look like it’s selling off to trick you into selling your shares. Their goal is to go under $115 to get out of their expiring contracts. This will be a major victory for them.

Hedge funds sell back and forth with one another at lower and lower bids in rapid succession, tricking algorithms into thinking there is a mass sell off when there actually isn’t. (They do this to scare off retail investors to engineer a sell off). Once the attack is over, the stock will normally go back up due to its demand. Then they will rinse and repeat their attack, each time hoping to chip away more and more retail investors. Most people in here know this, so if retail investors are selling, it’s unlikely that it’s anyone at all.

ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS HOLD HOLD HOLD! DONT GET PAPER HANDS DURING THE LAST HOUR, ITS WHAT THEY WANT!

29,ALL," Fidelity. Here's how to transfer - this post was removed by the mods in w.s.b, and I don't know why:

# Transferring from RH to Fidelity

This process is actually very simple. Earlier, I used to move ""mature"" positions from RH to Fidelity. I moved all my positions today. This is how I did this:

1. Log on to your Fidelity trading account on a browser.
2. In a different tab, log on to your RH account. Go to your info, and copy your RHS account number. Focus back on the Fidelity tab after copying this number.
3. In the top right of the Fidelity home page, type ""transfer asset"". Click on the link, and you should be in the Transfer of Assets (TOA) page.
4. Click on ""Start a transfer""
5. In the ""Select your current firm"" field, type ""Robinhood"". It should show up as ""Robinhood Securities Llc."". Select that to go to the next step.
6. In the next screen, paste the previously copied RH account number, and select ""individual"" in the account type.
7. In the next screen, you can select a specific equity or the whole account. Like I mentioned above, earlier I used to transfer single equities, but today, I selected ""entire account"".
8. I know that this works as I have transferred other accounts into Fidelity in the past without an issue (once I had an incorrect cost-basis, but that was taken care of with a phone call).
9. Wait 2-3 days for your RH account to show nothing, and a day or two after that for everything to pop up on Fidelity.
10. Now, you may shut down the RH account. Make sure you download ALL transactions before you close out the account. Who knows whether RH will even exist by the time it's the next tax filing season.",shantired,1817,/r/stocks/comments/l7tc1x/would_like_to_take_my_business_elsewhere_since_rh/gl95htk/,0.0,0.943,0.057,0.8957

Please read!!! This text will be the most important piece that you’ll see today!!!

They didn’t exit any of their short positions! You can look it up!!! The fund sold their shares to other funds, which made the stock algorithm think the stock is being sold —> price goes down —> the found that bought sells those shares again to the fund that sold them in the first place —> price drops even more —> they keep doing that —> price drops lower every time —> but as long as we hold they weren’t able to exit any positions!!! Shorts are still up 120% percent. As long as we hold the squeeze is inevitable!! And if you don’t believe me, look at the GME after hour stock price!

Furthermore don’t sell at 1000$ tomorrow or next week!!! It can be way fucking higher! I‘m talking about numbers around 10/20k per share! Compared to the VW squeeze in 2008 GME would need to be valued at 34000$ per share!!!

READ THIS!!!! COPIED IT FROM A WISE REDDITOR!!!

EVERYBODY READ THIS! Important!

Since it got removed: When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND 💎🙌 )

When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND 💎🙌 )

Too much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!) so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.

First, we need to understand what is ""Days to Cover"" or ""Short Ratio"" .

Official definition:

• ⁠Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted. • ⁠Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for the company in question. • ⁠A high 'days to cover' ratio can often signal a potential short squeeze.

Dumbed down version:

• ⁠imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days. • ⁠Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called ""Days to Cover""

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.

So you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.

So what does that mean for us?

Well, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.

Now, IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing! So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!

Now, CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit, but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!

The only numbers you should be looking at is the short ratio. If it's getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun. If it's still at fucking 138-140% like it is now, NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET.

We're at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to cover.

TL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!

Please read!!! This text will be the most important piece that you’ll see today!!!

They didn’t exit any of their short positions! You can look it up!!! The fund sold their shares to other funds, which made the stock algorithm think the stock is being sold —> price goes down —> the found that bought sells those shares again to the fund that sold them in the first place —> price drops even more —> they keep doing that —> price drops lower every time —> but as long as we hold they weren’t able to exit any positions!!! Shorts are still up 120% percent. As long as we hold the squeeze is inevitable!! And if you don’t believe me, look at the GME after hour stock price!

Furthermore don’t sell at 1000$ tomorrow or next week!!! It can be way fucking higher! I‘m talking about numbers around 10/20k per share! Compared to the VW squeeze in 2008 GME would need to be valued at 34000$ per share!!!

EVERYBODY READ THIS! Important!

When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND 💎🙌 )

Too much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!) so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.

First, we need to understand what is ""Days to Cover"" or ""Short Ratio"" .

Official definition:

• ⁠Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted. • ⁠Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for the company in question. • ⁠A high 'days to cover' ratio can often signal a potential short squeeze.

Dumbed down version:

• ⁠imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days. • ⁠Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called ""Days to Cover""

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.

So you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.

So what does that mean for us?

Well, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.

207,WPM, Love WPM. Sold out years ago when the Canadian Revenue Agency was going after them. Regret the sell but bought in again yesterday morning. Pretty unique business and fits well with the difficulty of mining it. They also have stockpiled it in the past to drive prices up. Do you know if they have any silver stored or if they sold when the prices jumped?

211,GME," There are undoubtedly a lot of big money and algo-traders that entered the fray.  If everyone who owns GME on principal is holding, then ask yourself how we're still trading tens of millions of shares?  Those are traders trying to capitalize on the price action.

212,AMC," Note that the following does not work for AMC but for GME due to the insane short interest. For AMC it accounts to a certain extend, but the unique position of GME appears due to it being shorted over 100%. So even if you want to cover every short it's physically impossible because so many shares don't exist. The only way is borrowing shares but you can't reserve shares.

And keep in mind, it's very unlikely they can buy all (all meaning not the 140% or the remaining 121%, but all of their own, as it's most likely split up) at once, meaning if they buy a big portion of stocks it will skyrocket the price and make it even worse for their other shorts. That also means everyone else has to buy on that increasing price and usually its just some major capitals invested in it (in such a game) and they wouldn't allow the other just to buy stocks and make it worse for the others. They work together and instead sell around in between them to lower stock price, but as long as people hold this has no effect (as in, yes it will bounce down, but go back up again).

Note: This gets even worse in puts since every put is worth 100 shares needed. These are options which expire today, which will force the person holding the options to exercise them. Or rather, it's exercised for them. That means if they have a put on 10$ and now it's on e.g. 200$, then they have to pay...I don't even know how puts are calculated since they have their own value. But it's a heck ton.

Shorts on the other hand do not run out. The only way a short is forced to close (in that case, squeezed) is if the account goes in such a negative value that the broker is forced to close their positions because they simply can't hold it anymore. And this is why a ton of people warn that Friday is not when it's over and newbies simply don't understand this. If people run away on Monday (since it happens after Friday closing hours) it meant nothing for the shorts, an even worse, every big company shorting at that point will make insane profit.",oodex,9,/r/stocks/comments/l7t1b0/cant_the_rich_just_buy_gme_or_amc/gl9ciy4/,0.105,0.796,0.099,-0.6887

217,GME," But why would they buy it an invest?

Its a bad investment. Yes you can bankrupt the short sellers and ut some compedition out of business. But most people at some point often look for a retrun on their investment.

I don't know much about the USA specifics since I am UK but currently there is a lot of similar things going on around the world in the retail sector. The entire industry / sector is completely unstable. People simply do not shop in the malls and shopping centers any more. Why would they? You can buy the item on the internet and it turns up 24-48 hours later and often its cheaper. Covid mostly has actually just massivly accelerated this process.

Even for more major items. Like I walked into a TV shop to try to actually buy a TV... They didn't have any in stock of any of the TV's I would have accepted. Their answer was ""We can order it for you and it would be here in 2 weeks"". No as a customer that is not acceptable since I can order it myself and it would be with me in 2 days and the whole process would be faster, cheaper.

So if you simply buy / invest into a failing market sector. The sector is still going to be failing. The people won't actually get a return on their investment. Yes it would prop GME up for a while longer but ultimatly its still going to fail in a business model. Look at it from a different perspective... What services do gamestop actually offer than other places don't.

Also I have a completly different take on the entire thing. I don't see anything that has happened with GME anything but a pump and dump. What I actually see is the people who think they are currently doing the manipulation are actally the manipulated. Effectivly somebody came up with a good back story and played on people emotions (hate the rich). I think the following happened

1. Identification of a creditable backstory (Mervin was spotted to have a large amount of shorts)
2. A few key people buy as much GME as they can afford (You can see this before the story hit)
3. Let the story out... Play the people tell them they can bankrupt mervin.
4. People really buy into the story based on emtion and irrational decision making. Cause there has beena  real narrative of ""hate the rich"" being pushed the last few years.
5. The original story guys sell out. Who care what happens to the rest. Somebody going to be left holding the bag.

We saw a lot of this around the first dot com bubble in late 90's. It was always the same pattern. At some stage next week people will really realise what actually happened.

Like all pump and dump's like this the people who get to the game early.. Also piggy back on it.

The people who get to the game late are left holding the bag. Next week you will see how butt hurt they are about losing massive amounts of money and how unfair the entire situation it even though they basically just gave their money voluntarly to the rich because they don't understand that the big boy game means big boy rules. This btw is why the ""rich"" are ""rich"" in the first place.. They see/do something that works the other 99% don't see/do.

The only thing that surprises me about this is that the back story has been so damm good. That even the entire media has also bought it.... This is because it really did hit mervin... Now if they had the balls and the credit lines to see it though. I can gurentee you they would have a very different outcome.

231,ALL," SHORT LADDER ATTACK INCOMING HOLD HOLD HOLD UPVOTE AND SHARE

In the last hour of trading some of us are predicting they will launch a short ladder attack to make it look like it’s selling off to trick you into selling your shares. Their goal is to go under $115 to get out of their expiring contracts. This will be a major victory for them.

Hedge funds sell back and forth with one another at lower and lower bids in rapid succession, tricking algorithms into thinking there is a mass sell off when there actually isn’t. (They do this to scare off retail investors to engineer a sell off). Once the attack is over, the stock will normally go back up due to its demand. Then they will rinse and repeat their attack, each time hoping to chip away more and more retail investors. Most people in here know this, so if retail investors are selling, it’s unlikely that it’s anyone at all.

ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS HOLD HOLD HOLD! DONT GET PAPER HANDS DURING THE LAST HOUR, ITS WHAT THEY WANT!

239,DD," Yes. Once the shorts have covered upward pressure stops. 

This trade works both ways. The shorts are in a crowded theater with a small exit right now and are all rushing for the door driving the price up.

Same principle on the way down. If you hold for the peak then the script flips and the longs are in a crowded theater with a small exit. Everyone rushes for the door at once. 

The other thing to consider is once it starts to descend there are not going to be a bunch of buyers in the higher levels. Once people realize it is tanking and the squeeze is over the price can descend at a crazy rapid pace until there are buyers. 

This is actually the piece that the media has right about it being dangerous for retail. If you do not recognize how the exit on this trade happens you can go from 400+ to 14 dollars very quickly. 

This is not advice purely educational. Do your own DD plan your exit. I pulled the trigger on my sell orders too quickly and left money on the table. ( I also bought in early December so my cost was lower) but I am also out safely and don’t run the risk of being caught in the collapse.

It’s essentially a game of prisoners dilemma. Too much profit taking ends the squeeze but no profit taking and you could just watch your position implode with no exit in site

241,AMC," In theory never. Look at AMC historically. If things open back up, AMC won't go out of business.

Also, the point of what people are doing now is to hold until the bitter end. I'm not giving you advice but if you have all your eggs in AMC you're doing it wrong.

250,GME, So the hedge funds borrowed the ability to purchase millions of shares of a stock like GME back when it was maybe $10 or so with the plan that they sell those shares immediately and then repay the borrower when the price of those shares drops.

Now if that price never happens they still have to pay back the person they borrowed the stocks from and the only way to do that is by buying the stock are whatever price it currently sits at.

Hedge funds shorting the stock pay interest on the shares they've borrowed based on the current price of the stock. These hedge funds can afford to pay high interest. It sucks, but they've got money. And paying interest is a lot cheaper than actually buying the $500 stocks to cover the short. 

In the meantime, they might make some money themselves on this squeeze and cover their shorts once the price drops dramatically.

Hedge funds shorting the stock pay interest on the shares they've borrowed based on the current price of the stock. These hedge funds can afford to pay high interest. It sucks, but they've got money. And paying interest is a lot cheaper than actually buying the $500 stocks to cover the short.

Not as boring; I just increased position in TSMC since it's currently dipping, probably because Samsung announced it's planning to start producing chips themselves. However, it will take Samsung time to build factories and start producing, TSMC is way ahead, so I think TSMC will be fine. TSMC is currently at full capacity and expanding.

Sony is also going through a dip, they're now in between console generations. I think they'll recover when PS5 is more widely available and the numbers come in.

Something else that could be promising is eBay - they’re cutting out PayPal and doing all transactions in-house - I don’t have the exact numbers off the top of my head but basically their fees will go up around 2.9% while net seller fees will go down (if you factor in the 3.4% PayPal fee). So by the end of 2021 their top line revenue will be increasing by a proportional amount no matter the volume now that the middleman (PayPal) is cut out. Of course the actual amount will probably be lower than the total fee increase if they have to pay credit card/Apple Pay fees - however they wouldn’t be making the switch if they didn’t see it as a profitable move. Of course we be in a tech bubble and who knows if it’ll be a good long position.

499,RH," It's likely to go higher before it crashes. Robinhood and a few others are attempting to slow the momentum by limiting the number of shares users can buy in aggregate, which is likely what's keeping it from just boosting into the stratosphere.

A large number of users also seem to be switching to other brokers due to RH issues, so there's a bit of a transition going on too while people setup their new accounts (many seem to have to wait a few days before they are being allowed to trade on those new accounts).

There's a lot going on right now, so can be difficult to follow which way the tide is turning.

If you think the idea behind the squeeze is sound, then hold. If you're just in it to say you were there and make a few bucks, go ahead and sell.

Worst case is you lose out on $75, but more likely you just about break even on the way down or still even profit a bit. Best case scenario you make a bit, potentially much more.

520,IMO," Anybody who follows Apple knows that a dip always happens after earnings release.  EVERY SINGLE TIME.  

Doesn't matter how good the earnings report is either.  Always a dip.

The reason for this is Wall Street doesn't like the fact that Tim Cook won't provide guidance on the next quarter.  Since he refuses to provide them with this info, it causes the street to ""lose confidence"" that Apple can continue their record gains.

It's quite absurd IMO.  If Apple came out next quarter showing it to be the first company in history with a trillion dollar revenue quarter, the stop would drop 5% because Tim Cook refuses to speculate on the next quarter.

So I recommend that everybody short Apple stock a day or so before the next earnings statement and the cover your short over the next few days as Apple takes a 5% dip.

1.  If he provides conservative guidance on the next quarter, Apple stock takes a moderate dip because institutional investors will view it as negative compared to their massive prior earnings report.

2.  If he provides optimistic guidance on the next quarter and Apple fails to meet those expectations, then Apple takes a monster hit.

3.  If he does nothing and refuses to give guidance, Apple stock will take a small hit (5-10%) but Tim Cook figures that's better than potentially taking a huge hit if he does #1 or #2.

573,ALL," SHORT LADDER ATTACK INCOMING HOLD HOLD HOLD UPVOTE AND SHARE

In the last hour of trading some of us are predicting they will launch a short ladder attack to make it look like it’s selling off to trick you into selling your shares. Their goal is to go under $115 to get out of their expiring contracts. This will be a major victory for them.

Hedge funds sell back and forth with one another at lower and lower bids in rapid succession, tricking algorithms into thinking there is a mass sell off when there actually isn’t. (They do this to scare off retail investors to engineer a sell off). Once the attack is over, the stock will normally go back up due to its demand. Then they will rinse and repeat their attack, each time hoping to chip away more and more retail investors. Most people in here know this, so if retail investors are selling, it’s unlikely that it’s anyone at all.

Now the average user would be thinking what do these numbers mean? If S3 Ventures are right? Keep what you are doing and you will squeeze them dry but if Ortex is right then they have already started covering their short positions to people who are buying the dips and with brokers reducing the capacity to buy more stocks.

Essentially they can do short ladder -> buy your dips -> repeat -> until they covered most of their short positions on fat losses but saving themselves from eternal squeeze.

[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-retail-trading-shortbets-idUSKBN29X1SW] This also coincides work with the latest report of Ortex estimating 70M loss by Top Firms (they covered their positons taking the losses)

And it actually makes sense with all of the shady shit that RH and other brokers have pulled off (although probably not since clearance firms did increased the deposits to match with the volatility although still quite weird that chose yesterday for it and not the day prior to it right when movement gained its maximum peak. 

So Hedge fends keep doing a short-ladder and buy your dips reducing their overall loss, these billionaires aren't billionaires by being dumb. I'm pretty sure taking the L is one of the most important lesson and being realistic with market demands (especially if you are a shorter which they are). 

---

Bottom-line being that you need to become cautious if Ortex is right and start planning an exit strategy unless you want to sacrifice the newcomers in this movement and end them with burned hands because when the hedge funds are done with their coverings - RH and all of the other brokers will remove all the restrictions and what will be happening would be is pump and dump except the losses and profits will be shared among retailers alone (and most probably newcomers/noobs since they lack any experience).

Whats worse is that GME, BB, NOK, AMC are all tracking GME as their leader and heavily co-relating it meaning if GME falls and then so will other stocks with it.

TLDR: **Start planning exit strategy if Ortex's data is right telling that Hedge Funds have covered most of their positions by now but please don't sell instantly, you have to HOLD and mutually agree with a profitable exit strategy.**

Now the average user would be thinking what do these numbers mean? If S3 Ventures are right? Keep what you are doing and you will squeeze them dry but if Ortex is right then they have already started covering their short positions to people who are buying the dips and with brokers reducing the capacity to buy more stocks.

Essentially they can do short ladder -> buy your dips -> repeat -> until they covered most of their short positions on fat losses but saving themselves from eternal squeeze.

Bottom-line being that you need to become cautious if Ortex is right and start planning an exit strategy unless you want to sacrifice the newcomers in this movement and end them with burned hands because when the hedge funds are done with their coverings - RH and all of the other brokers will remove all the restrictions and what will be happening would be is pump and dump except the losses and profits will be shared among retailers alone (and most probably newcomers/noobs since they lack any experience).

Whats worse is that GME, BB, NOK, AMC are all tracking GME as their leader and heavily co-relating it meaning if GME falls and then so will other stocks with it.

TLDR: **Start planning exit strategy if Ortex's data is right telling that Hedge Funds have covered most of their positions by now but please don't sell instantly, you have to HOLD and mutually agree with a profitable exit strategy.**

UPVOTE AND SHARE

In the last hour of trading some of us are predicting they will launch a short ladder attack to make it look like it’s selling off to trick you into selling your shares. Their goal is to go under $115 to get out of their expiring contracts. This will be a major victory for them.

Hedge funds sell back and forth with one another at lower and lower bids in rapid succession, tricking algorithms into thinking there is a mass sell off when there actually isn’t. (They do this to scare off retail investors to engineer a sell off). Once the attack is over, the stock will normally go back up due to its demand. Then they will rinse and repeat their attack, each time hoping to chip away more and more retail investors. Most people in here know this, so if retail investors are selling, it’s unlikely that it’s anyone at all.

Yes, the short float is big but who is not to say that they did not just move the short positions at a higher price and the increase now is the effect of them covering at the lower prices and also the price increased due to high demand and large amount of greed from people wanting a part in the squeeze. Also, they could have covered by now since the stock grew by 700 in 9 days. Was that the squeeze? They don't have to disclose where they short so maybe that's why they aren't saying anything?

Robinhood and other shitty brokerages are allowing us to buy 2, 5, or very low numbers of GME. However, they are allowing option contracts.

610,GME," The reason it is thought that this stock will continue to rise over the coming days is the fact that all the big traders who shorted this stock have to buy back in to cover their short positions at some point. Over 90% of all $GME shares at the start of all this were shorted.

~Quick Guide to Shorting Stocks~

1) An investor borrows a security (stock) and sells it on the open market, planning to buy it back later for less money.

2) Short sellers bet on, and profit from, a drop in a security's price. This can be contrasted with long investors who want the price to go up.

3) Short selling is high risk, high reward. If the security happened to go up in price and not down, then the short sellers can no longer profit by buying back in, instead they have to buy in at a higher price therefore losing a lot of money, or they may trigger a margin call on their broker account.

4) Margin Call happens once you reach a certain threshold with your broker account. The broker will perform a margin call, and if you don't deposit more funds or if the price moves further against you, then the trade will automatically close and you'll be left with 2-3% of the account's original value.

Back to $GME - much of the remaining 10% or so shares were bought up by retail investors like those on WSB, plus other investors, who are all holding onto their shares and even buying more. So, essentially, there's very little opportunity for those short investors to buy back in unless they want to lose money. And even if they do buy in, it causes the share price to actually rise even further. So they are all locked into this massive snowball effect.

Now, someone WILL get burned and left holding the bag at some point, it just depends on how early people sell their positions and how quickly it all moves. But basically Wall Street traders are locked into this, and the price is only increasing. It closed today far higher than it did yesterday, and it's thought that it will really take off early next week.

To add fuel to the fire and what makes WSB so confident is that other big investors are still piling money into GME. Justin Sun for example was planning to buy $10 million worth of shares when the Asia markets opened: https://twitter.com/justinsuntron/status/1355163433700745220?s=19

What happens if they didn't lie on CNBC and have actually covered? What happens when the official short reports from the exchanges release on February 9 and the short interest is almost nothing?

Anyone holding then will be fucked by the sell off. The hope of the squeeze is keeping people holding. Once that is gone, profit taking. 

Keep in mind Melvin liquidated all its long positions on Tuesday and Wednesday. They didn't liquidate so they could sit in Cash. It was used to cover. Very few could buy yesterday after the crash and yet the price rallied...

The float is about 50.65M, shares outstanding are short interest as of 1/15 (the only 100% accurate number we have) was 121.98% percent. Shares held short would be about 61.8 million. 

They could have been covering since Wednesday when they liquidated or even before. Only WSBers are HODL on GME. Plenty of traders have been buying and selling.

At the end of the day, the stocks have to be returned. And the only way they are getting the stocks back, is if they buy them. And if you've visited WSB, nobody is selling. Not even the person who holds tens of millions of dollars in GME on there is selling. He is the one leading the charge.

So the only way the shorts can be returned is if they are bought back. If the hedge funds can't buy them back, someone in the line has to.

Yeah I don't know shit about anything, most of the answers I get to this point to S3 Partners but I've read the true data is released twice a month, so next on Feb 1:

https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1355225495835709441

This guy says that the original shorts have been squeezed (the first run up) and (mostly?) closed, and now there are new shorts (hedge funds doubling down at the current prices) maintaining that >100% short. And I guess WSB will try to continue squeezing these new shorts.

https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355234358194556928

But I'm not really clear on this second wave of shorts, perhaps if enough time passes retail confidence/attention will fade and the second squeeze doesn't happen. It seems like people also think the first squeeze is ongoing but isn't that impossible to know without knowing if the original shorts were closed?

672,GME," it could go to $1000, it could go to $10.  

Basically, stocks can be shorted which just means someone expects the price to fall and they make money off it falling.  hedge funds have spent millions, billions on betting Game Stop will go down...so much, they bet 140% of the floated shares will be shorted.  That is 40% more than what should be the max and even then 100% is ridiculous.  

So what has happened here is the community came together to keep the price from falling, which forces the shorts to lose money and thus not make money because their price targets are never reached. They have lost $70 billion in a matter of days because of this. and it will be over $100 by today IMHO.  Maybe $120b. 

IF the shorts cover their position, which means they have to pay out at the current stock price of $300 or whatever it is, it will close out their short position but at a Massive loss and it will cause the stock price to rise. 

IF a bunch of people started selling GME, the stock price will slowly fall, making it easier for the shorts to recover their money or at least lessen the damage. 

but nobody knows wtf is going to happen, because we don't know what elite forces will start getting involved (SEC, govt officials, etc..) or what bailouts will happen.  That is why if you want to buy it...I'd buy a couple shares if you can afford it and just hope it goes up.  and assume it will go down and you will lose the money.  

It's gambling, plain and simple.  Gamble what you are willing to be fine losing.

[WSB will not allow me to post since I’m less than 45days old on their sub. If you think this makes sense, please feel free to repost]

I love you all and this group. And I still hold a large proportion of my GME and AMC positions. That said, I do want to call out that the short squeeze we were all expecting may now not materialize. Here’s why:

There were 50M trades today. Retail investors couldn’t buy much due to restrictions. So very likely that majority of the buys were done by short sellers covering their position. Total short was around 60M as of Jan 15. Assuming they accounted for 80% of the buys today, that’s 40M positions closed. Only 20M shorts likely left, if that. High enough - but not enough for the kind of squeeze projected. Daily trading volumes are 100M - 200M and these shorts can easily cover their positions without moving the price much in these volumes.

Does that mean the price won’t go up? No - the price can still move if enough people buy. But at that point, it’ll be no different than a pump and dump - we will just be taking money from a fellow retard who’ll be left holding the bag. Not from the hedge funds who’ve likely already exited their positions.

This is all theory. I hope I’m proven wrong and the hedge funds were fools to short even more. I don’t think they’d want to play with fire again after getting burnt though.

Welcome your thoughts. But please don’t pile on without rationally thinking through this. A lot of people’s money is at stake here.

PS: I intend to hold the GME and AMC positions I have right through the end of this (wherever we end up). For me, this was as much or more about the cause as the money. And so, I’m prepared to lose the money as well if it so happens.

PS2: Please get the hell out of Robinhood. Those sellouts built their business on us retail investors and they’ve sold us out to their hedge fund buddies.

689,OR," I learned today that there exists a such thing as a clearing firm (ie. the clearing firm behind WeBull who restricted WeBull's gme transactions).

Why does buying/selling a stock need two different entities in the middle?

When I first started investing, I was very annoyed by the fact that I have to go through a middle man a.k.a the broker.

In physical goods market, such as when buying a clothing, if I want to buy a Nike product, I can directly go to Nike website to order OR go through a middle man such as Amazon to buy Nike product. I did not get why I can't just directly go buy a stock like that.

However, if I think differently, it kinda makes sense because Nike's job is to sell their product so they spend time setting up their website and stuff to sell directly. However, companies' job is not to sell stocks so it'd be inefficient for them to set things up but rather just delegate to a middle man (broker) to do the job.

However, now that I realized there is one more middle man (clearing firm), I'm now not getting why stock market needs two different entities rather than just having one entity dealing the whole flow of buying and selling.

Is that just the legacy of old way or is that actually something that has to stay that way even in the future? (To elaborate what I mean: How things are done change over time when people realize the old way is inefficient and new technology/knowledge can be used to do things in a more efficient way. I'm wondering if having two middle man is actually how things have to be done or is just an old way that is legacy but should be changed to a more efficient way now/future.)",whiteSkar,8,/r/stocks/comments/l7mzx9/rstocks_daily_discussion_fundamentals_friday_jan/gl7tipc/,0.013,0.943,0.044,0.8459

Here's what I don't get, if someone on here could answer it for me:

What is the exit strategy for these guys?  At some point, the price *will* come down.  I'm not saying that the price crashes today or next week -- but it will, at some point, come back down to reality. Eventually, either the short interest all gets covered, some hedge funds go bankrupt and simply skip out on their obligations, WSB loses interest in this and people pull their money either because they are bored or they want the cash, and/or the regulators intervene and put a stop to it (whatever that looks like). In any event, it's safe to say that GME does not stay at ~$300 in perpetuity.

Meanwhile, the only way this works is if people continue to buy -- and the reality is they are paying ~$300 for share in a company that has a non-sustainable model and is on a slow, inevitable march to bankruptcy and a stock price of $0.

So a bunch of people are going to be left holding the bag. I just don't see how there is a long-term strategy to unwind this without a bunch of people, from retailers to hedge funds, taking the hit.

What's your idea about GME and r/wallstreetbets? Many people in there are motivated like crazy, everyone says hold and they think it can go up to 10k-20k. There are some serious screenshots of losses but still, everyone says hold.

Could these massive amounts of loss screenshots be fake and make people just lose money? I don’t think so, but...

Why GME pumped up like crazy while it's just a normal company?

Right now I’m in loss of ~£1000 in my strategy (fake money, trial, no real money) account. This started to concern me because I wouldn’t be happy if this was my real money.

797,UWMC," Fundamental comments below. Cup and handle question: Could a cup and handle apply to a company going through a SPAC merger and is a 1yr chart long enough to identify? I've seen criticism of using short term charts. Looking at the UWMC 1yr chart, it looks like the end of the handle right now, but is the recent merger a variable that would negate looking for something like this?

Edit: merger is complete. This WAS a spac and listed as UWMC on 1/22

On fundamentals: UWMC reports earnings next week. [UWMC is the number one wholesale lender and sitting on cash from the merger](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210121005895/en/United-Wholesale-Mortgage-LLC-and-Gores-Holdings-IV-Inc.-Announce-Closing-of-Business-Combination) and Ishbia.

On volume: We all know [the refi boom continues](http://www.mortgagenewsdaily.com/consumer_rates/960651.aspx) but UWM is strong on purchases, even offering a [10 day appraisal guarantee](https://www.housingwire.com/articles/uwm-will-partially-refund-borrowers-for-late-appraisals/)

Catalyst for increase: upcoming earnings will be juiced by the [IPO pricing incentive](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.housingwire.com/articles/uwm-offering-61-bps-on-conventional-loans-through-march-8/amp/)

806,CEO," I learned the hard way awhile back that as long as Tim Cook is CEO, Apple stock is going to fall after every earnings statement.

It doesn't matter how good the earnings statement is, Apple always drops afterwards.  Apple could report a 1 trillion dollar quarterly earnings, and Apple would still drop like a rock afterwards.

Why?  Because Tim Cook refuses to give guidance on the next quarter.  He likes to play things conservatively, and he probably worries that if he gives expectations and Apple doesn't meet it, their stock could drop by 25-50%

So instead Tim Cook gives out awesome earnings statements, but stays silent on guidance for the next quarter.  Wall Street hates that, and as a result Apple stock always falls after an earnings statement is released.

Tim Cook has made the the decision that he would rather not give guidance and cause a 5-10% dip, rather than give guidance and run the risk of a 50% dip if Apple doesn't meet their targets.

So my strategy for Apple is to immediately short the stock a day before the earnings statement comes out, wait for the stock to tank over a week or two, and then buy more on the dip.",platon20,6,/r/stocks/comments/l7mzx9/rstocks_daily_discussion_fundamentals_friday_jan/gl969vk/,0.075,0.887,0.038,-0.6747

815,GME," Its not so much about the company or how well its doing. Its now about taking advantage of a unique situation. The reason it is thought that this stock will continue to rise over the coming days is the fact that all those who shorted it (originally over 90% of the shares held were shorted) have to buy back in to cover at some point. The remaining shares have been bought up by WSB and other investors and many are holding or even buying more. So, essentially, there's very little opportunity for those big shorts to buy back in unless they pay more, and when they do so... guess what? The share price just continues to rise each time. So its a massive snowball effect. Yes someone will get burned and left holding the bag ar some point, its kind of about how greedy people are going to be and timing the exit right.

To add fuel to the fire, other big investors are still piling money into GME. Justin Sun for example is planning to buy $10 million worth of shares when the Asia markets open (https://twitter.com/justinsuntron/status/1355163433700745220?s=19)

If you understand shorting, you know it’s hard as fuck to pull off correctly. The number is more around 20 billion for GME. That 20 billion doesn’t tell the whole story. It sounds so significant but it’s because these hedges were that greedy. Who shorts 300k at 3.50 ya know? They can double down all they want, they will win eventually. 

You’re focusing on GME, but what happens when they stop reporting short interest positions to drive price lower and just blend in with Normal routines? Citron already said moving forward they’ll never report. 

It drives down the overall price action, volume, and eagerness. Volkswagen in 2008 was not that either. A company bought up the float, forming it into a low float stock essentially. More demand, less supply, higher price. That’s what caused a squeeze. People here think holding shares are gonna prevent something, they only do if everyone is on board. Little billy 20 shares won’t do shit when you can NAKED SHORT SELL. Not just shorting, but reshortingwith IMAGINARY shares not even in the float.

I’m not defending them, who would? I’m simply stating my opinion on what has and will happen. Why are shorts down 70 billion on the year aside from it being difficult?

With that said I still have 1 part I am not understanding. So the DTC has to hold the stock for 2 days. Why is this considered a risk for them? I think you mentioned that the risk is in finding a matching “partner” for a given trade. But I assumed that when I made a bid, and someone matched with their ask, that the “match” has already been made. So what is meant by the DTC needing to match a transaction? If it is already matched, then it shouldn’t really matter if the stock has gone up or down should it? (Unless somehow either side was able to back out of the deal, which I wouldn’t imagine should be possible).

Another question I have... I’ve see. “clearing house” and the dtc used interchangeably, but from what I can tell they are separate entities.

Realistically I don’t see Melvin shorting more than 10% of the stock. It was probably a few funds/ investors doing it and collectively the shorted more than 100%.

I do have a bad feeling about the way WSB pumped GME. Stock markets are not really made for these targeted buys and holds. Read up on bear raids from the 90s and how they were ruled illegal. This is pretty much the same but in a different direction. I think WSB had a good intention, but then just got infiltrated by people wanting to pump the stock and some other ones saying that they are just here to make a statement.

Point is, this is triggering bubbles everywhere. Now they are pumping Doge (coin) which is not shorted by anyone, and does not harm Wall Street at all.

That's just one guy's opinion, but one who is ""in the industry"". Streaming is doing damage to theaters, [exclusive release windows](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/28/amc-strikes-historic-deal-with-universal-shortening-number-of-days-films-need-to-run-in-theaters-before-going-digital.html) are dropping, and the ""hype"" is video on demand. There is a bit of convenience to staying at home to watch something (No overpriced concessions! You can pause for bathroom breaks!) and home televisions are much, much better than they used to be at the height of the strip mall peak era (all complete with new, shiny cinemas of course) in the early 1990s. So it is very possible cinema will have to reform even more around offering a total experience (more Alamo Drafthouse-ish than what they were before).

That being said, people will be going out more after coronavirus plays out. Maybe the cinema is one of those destinations. if you want to put a little bit in cinema, AMC previously was not the greatest one to play outside the memes due to a lousy balance sheet (although [the memesters are helping here](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/amc-entertainment-to-issue-444-million-shares-as-investors-opt-to-convert-600-million-of-convertible-debt-2021-01-28) so we'll see what happens).

1044,GME," To answer in order:

\- Both Melvin and Citron reported closing their initial short positions ([ref](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-27/melvin-capital-closes-out-its-gamestop-position-cnbc-reports).) Not sure if they entered into new short positions after, but it was reported they both closed at a loss.

\- No idea. Maybe try and get a poll going over there.

\- Complex question. You would need to know how many outstanding shorts are presently open, then multiply that volume with the share price. You would also need to know who owns the short position and how much capital they have at their expense. Not sure this answer is possible.

\- For every buyer there is a seller. Hypothetically, if every shareholder decides that they are only willing to sell for $500, then that becomes market price per share. However, what if nobody wants to buy at $500? One shareholder decides to sell and finds a buyer at $450. That makes $450 the market price. This cycle continues in either direction as buyers and sellers determine the price they are willing to buy/sell.

The problem with the GME move is it's not tied to fundamentals and it's become manipulated and inflated to levels beyond what most would consider reasonable market value. With that said, each shareholder has every right to set their sell price. If nobody is willing to buy, then it simply won't get filled.",InfinitusStultorum,3,/r/stocks/comments/l855cz/is_there_enough_money_to_be_squeezed_out_for/glb4c61/,0.069,0.871,0.059,-0.1088

1. Price dropping from AH due to exchanges blocking buy orders of BB yesterday, and limiting buy orders today (I think RH only allowed each person to buy 65 shares max); and only allowing sell orders to get executed.
2. The options market influencing a closing price specifically around $14-15 due to something called ""pinning"".

1126,DD," Eu investor here. I am invested long in RR on the LSE. The reason why I took it over other listings is the fact that I believe that the Pound as been really weak at this time (granted: Brexit + Covid). I expect, and this is my personal belief, the pound to recover in the next few years. Therefore amplifying my profits if/when I decided to sell or re-balance my portfolio.

On another note, I don't expect Rolls-Royce to go bankrupt (although is always a possibility) due to their involvement and importance to British economy, the government won't let that easily happen (but nothing is guaranteed). Also, RR is making changes (energy, defense,etc), its evolving, so expect a very turbulent (pun intended)  year at least. It is my personal belief that it will get worse before it gets better. In any case, I keep buying dips and playing for the long game.

Everyone is expecting a recover from travel at some point in the future, although airline companies need to sell tickets to create revenue, RR does not. It does not matter to RR if the plane is full or if it has only 1 passenger. What matters is that those engines are rolling. Therefore I expect a quicker initial bump on RR when air-travel starts putting planes in the air. And the to trade sideways until planes are getting full and more are needed in the air and bumping it some more - unlike airlines, which will see revenues growing with number of tickets in a more smooth linear way.

I didn't want to turn me comment on an extensive DD but I am aware of those weaknesses and others including their debt, wasting resources (in my opinion) developing electric engines for small planes that have a tiny moat (??) .

I am also in RR for many many years... 5 years minimum unless something fundamental changes for the worst. Hence why I am buying my way in slowly while deploying the majority of the cash into other, more near term upside companies.

1129,DD," Ok, I am going to answer you from memory cause I am on my phone and out for the weekend. You should definitely research this, the Rolls Royce website has information on this matter.

There are many forces driving this, but I assure you that the market (almost) always corrects itself instantly for any arbitrage. Hence is usually really hard to take advantage of this.

Each stock has different rights and that is explained on their website. Therefore they are valued differently (voting rights, etc).

I also remember that in 2007 1Pound was roughly 1.6 € I think. Therefore the stock should automatically be 60% higher when in €. 

Other thing is volume, bid-ask spreads and liquidity... RR LSE is the most liquid if I am not mistaken. 

Then there is the dividend that has different rules for each stock (if I remember correctly) . On LSE I can chose to receive money, I can chose to receive RR stocks or I can receive a different, low tier stock if I want too (all explained in their website) 

I read a lot about this, but I don't remember all the specifics and some details might be a little fuzzy... but at the end of the day I went with RR.LSE and I am trusting my previous DD CD

1130,RXT," The are at least a few potential down sides, but they seem highly limited in my opinion.

* **1.** The short sellers are correct, and RXT declines in price. This is largely dependent on timing, and I haven't found any sufficient information that leads me to believe they are correct.

* **2.** RXT remains under the radar. Since part of my thesis relies on the continued activity of traders seeking out companies with high short interest, a lack of activity may result in RXT trading flat. 

* **3.** Any negative anomaly, such as an announcement of poor performance, lack of sales, financial distress, etc. Based on RKT's history, this seems unlikely.

1132,GME," I don't expect any stock to become the next GME, certainly not within the near term. The circumstances are too unique. Instead, 
and with consideration to the current climate, it's prudent to look for opportunities in stocks with abnormal short interest, but which are fundamentally good stocks. These provide secure price floors while offering upside opportunity.

The majority of GME's movement has been due to high volume call option purchases and gamma squeezes, not short squeezes. The short interest has remained astronomically high, and additional short positions have been opened throughout the past several weeks. Markets predominantly move based on forward thinking (anticipation). 

A volume/float ratio of 33x is a positive indicator for this trade. When making speculations of this nature, the ideal entry is during a high volume/float ratio, not a small one. A small ratio indicates increased price action, which means most traders have already arrived to the party. 

You don't require a proverbial ""squeeze"" for high short interest companies to move. If the climate dictates substantial risk, which it does, and the underlying company indicates positive growth, which it does, it becomes asymmetrically risky to maintain a short position. 

Regardless of these ideas, it's likely that over the next few weeks, we'll see a large influx of retail traders seeking out anything with an abnormal short interest, and this drives price action.",thirtydelta,5,/r/stocks/comments/l7yg4u/when_short_sellers_are_wrong_opportunities_with/gl9m6s8/,0.019,0.772,0.209,0.9938

You get this wrong. GME is fucking with *some* hedgefonds. You will have a lot of wallstreet money that cashed in on long positions during the meteoric rise. Wallstreet will make tons of money with this either way.

Scenario 1:
It's a pump & dump with no squeeze before the dump is started. Shorts will make a fortune and big money will have optimized exits losing a lot less than retailers.

Squeeze will materialize. Wallstreet and the hedgefonds pumping money into this will win, as will the people invested in the stock that don't miss the exit.

I think at $80 it was a good time to jump in and if you can time one of the more dramatic dips that is awesome as well.

I hate shorting so I would love this to hurt the hedges to the maximum but I'm also going to give advice of what I would do since this is a bit of a prisoner's dilemma for everyone involved at this point in time.

1214,CEO," Your assets in Robinhood are SIPC insured for up to $500,000.

That being said, one of three things is happening with Robinhood:  
  
1. They are in cahoots with hedge funds and intentionally restricted trading to stop their users from earning money at the expense of their business partners. This is highly unethical and illegal. If you want a broker that is ethical, you should stop using Robinhood.  
  
2. They are having liquidity problems and cannot come up with the margin required by clearing houses. The CEO denies that this is the case but may be hesitant to openly admit it because the company is trying to go public. If you want a broker that is financially secure, you should stop using Robinhood.  
  
3. Robinhood is genuinely concerned about their users and has decided to restrict them from buying certain high-risk stocks to protect them. If you want a broker, not a nanny, you should stop using Robinhood.  
  
No matter which of these is true, the conclusion is the same: you should stop using Robinhood. Most online brokerages will allow you to transfer your assets from Robinhood. Robinhood charges $75 for this but many brokerages will pay it for you or otherwise reimburse you if your portfolio is worth enough.",Powered_by_JetA,20,/r/stocks/comments/l89pxt/should_i_realistically_get_off_rh/glbe0nd/,0.144,0.729,0.126,-0.6518

Some said that yes the MMs did close their naked shorts and then others say that SI % float is still 129% or 98% or something and that they still have not been squeezed if its 98% then I would assume that yes they did close a portion today.

Of course when short sellers close the price goes up, which made sense assuming they closed at $113 > causing stock to go back up 

And as you said what stops them from doing this tomorrow well it just depends on volume. I think they were able to do it today because of the dirty stuff they pulled with multiple stock halts and telling brokers to not sell anymore so whether they do something similar tomorrow is definitely interesting to see how they would do it.

It was weird how it went up like crazy AH which didn't make sense cos most volume and retail investors are low during that time and so you would think the big dogs want it to go low, but its kinda sketch cos possibly they playing both sides as someone was explaining to me essentially hiking the price up AH by putting in calls but once its hiked they sell new shorts > next day market open they start their scare tactics as they been doing > driving the price down allowing them to close those new shorts > now they put in new calls to spike it AH and do it all over which really does kinda make sense in regards to what happened.",mateyman,1,/r/stocks/comments/l7ldq3/quick_question_about_calls_that_need_to_be/gl7i9kt/,0.056,0.893,0.051,-0.3612

1262,RH," Read about the collateral requirements put up by clearing houses. FFS RH does not clear their orders on GME or meme stocks. If the clearing house asks to put up 100% collateral for a creation of new order, RH just stops allowing new orders to be open.

1264,RH," Say you are a clearing house. You connect buyers and sellers. The brokerage send your order to the clearing house, they give you the stock or money depending on if you buy or sell, but they need 3 days to confirm that the order is legit. This is because of SEC regulations. In the meantime they take on risk because in 3 days the price of an asset will change so they ask for collateral from the brokerages. Usually this collateral is small because no stock jumps from 100 to 400 and back to 120 in 2 days. Because they stock is more volatile they need to hedge better, and now they ask for 100% collateral from brokerages on top of your money that they transferred to the clearing house.

1284,AAPL," I posted this in /r/options, but I'll post this here for those wondering.

 Here's why this was a great day to buy NASDAQ/Tech.

First, I hope you're familiar with the concept of max-pain, and today is the essence of max-pain trying to kill off every written option to maximize returns.

For example, this is a [list of FB calls expiring today](https://ibb.co/YWBKzFk), nearly 57,000 options with rights on 5.7m shares. Every last call owner until 250 will be massacred today, a good thing if you wrote 275 (covered or naked) calls a few weeks ago instead of buying them.

Then here is the [same story with FB puts](https://ibb.co/8zgsFgs), with nearly 40,000 of them being massacred out in the open. The max pain area for FB for the day will be between 250 and 257, the lower it goes, you should pick up any option expiring next month or later.

The story is the same for AAPL, AMD, and MSFT where everyone is getting slaughtered regardless of their position's side. For AAPL the max pain area seems to be $130 to $131, AMD's is $87-$88, and anything above $88C or below $87P is well butchered. MSFT's max pain is around $230 to $235, anything above $235C and below $230P is wrecked. Again, puts will be up today, there is no doubt about it given the market bleed, but they are only up relative to yesterday.

I can see us trading for the rest of day within those thresholds, and personally, it's a great time to pick up cheap calls for FEB. I welcome all criticism and thoughts... also, not financial advice.

I think it is wonky now because your cash position was unsettled so the numbers aren’t adding up. Did you actually purchase the share for 249 or is that what you set the limit to? Cause the numbers are still not adding up anyway. I’d check and verify your purchase price and see if the math adds up then.

## Free riding violation

**What is it?** While the term ""free riding"" may sound like a pleasant experience, it's anything but. A free riding violation occurs when you buy securities and then pay for that purchase by using the proceeds from a sale of the same securities. This practice violates Regulation T of the Federal Reserve Board concerning broker-dealer credit to customers. The following examples illustrate how 2 hypothetical traders (Marty and Trudy) might incur free riding violations.

**Free riding example, Marty:**

* Marty has $0 cash available to trade
* On Monday morning, Marty buys $10,000 of ABC stock
* No payment is received from Marty by Wednesday's settlement date
* On Thursday, Marty sells ABC stock for $10,500 to cover the cost of his purchase

A free riding violation occurs because Marty did not pay for the stock in full prior to selling it.",Artistic_Gap2203,1,/r/stocks/comments/l81222/day_trade_with_unsettled_funds/gla2zqb/,0.148,0.677,0.175,0.5859
