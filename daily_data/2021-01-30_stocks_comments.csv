1,GME," I'm not sad or depressed, I'm very angry.  Those will probably come later, so I get where you're coming from.  I'm in this GME thing, have been for some time.  Luckily my cost basis is below $300 so the absolute blatant market manipulation that happened Thursday, on top of all the other things, only helped me lower my cost basis.

If no real reforms come from this, which I honestly don't expect, then the system is officially rigged and the rich run the US.  So far they can blatantly lie, cheat, and steal and face no repercussions.  I didn't follow the 2008 crash enough when I was younger, I was in college, but it sounds like those incredibly risky investors should've been put in jail.

Anyone involved with Thursday's \~$300-400 depression to close out their shorts at significantly less losses should have all their money taken from them and divided amongst the shareholders who they stole from.  Then they should go to jail for however long is appropriate for stealing tens or hundreds of billions of dollars, market manipulation, lying, etc.  I'm no lawyer, but life in prison sounds fair.",CompulsionOSU,15,/r/stocks/comments/l8b4pp/is_anyone_else_feeling_really_depressed_from_the/glcbq91/,0.21,0.717,0.073,-0.9842
2,DD," You were naive, but that doesn’t mean you have to feel bad for yourself. The socioeconomic elite always have had the upper hand and always will, that’s just a fact of life (not just stocks). That doesn’t mean you can’t do well for yourself, it just means you’re more limited than some.

Those with wealth always have better resources than those who don’t and worse resources than those with more wealth, and it will stay that way. From access to information, brokers, and trades. 

As technology advances, those who have the best software and the fastest computers will be able to process news and make trades better and faster than someone without those resources can open an article and read the headline. 

Those with faster internet connections can make better trades than you. What happens if their order gets to market in a microsecond and yours takes a millisecond? You’re last in line. But you’re still in the line.

People will always scheme, plot, or have the upper-hand to you. But that won’t stop you from doing well. You can still do your DD and make smart decisions that give you financial gain. You just won’t beat the best of the best in a 1-to-1 competition.

4,GOOD," it's a pandemic.

this is a tough world we're in right now. this was NOT supposed to be an easy market. And many of us thought we were shooting fish in a barrel this year. Or bobbing for AAPLs. And the market was still so, so high. IT STILL IS. And, I'm sorry for being bearish but when I get that gut feeling----I am not an analyst. I am not that smart. Ok? I have sold early. I have underperformed S&P. And other years I have CRUSHED it. Is it a bummer when I underperform? OF COURSE.

But from my point of view, watching all time highs combined with manias multiplied by short squeezes----feeling some confusion??? THAT IS FAIR. And if you have a bad feeling about this----it is OKAY to lock in some gains. The market and the economy have been COMPLETELY divorced this year.

So, if you have a bad gut feeling about this, you do not have to buy the dip. You can recognize that gut feeling is a GOOD part of your craft. You can look at this and say no. I don't think this was good for the market, I don't think this was good for my investments, I don't think this was good for Feburary or March or April, and you can say lock in my gains. You can look at WSB and say I'm going to wait until this insanity is over and I'll get back in afterwards thank you. You can say ""that isn't my market."" That's okay. If you look at this and think the WSB boys might be right---that's ok. I think they are. And I think it's bad.

6,UK," So I know I'm late to this party and I'm sure my comments won't be read by a lot of folks. But I'm offering this to OP.

The world has always operated in favor of the rich. The rich and the powerful have always had the upper hand--and that's true going back to before the founding of the Roman Republic or the rise of classical Greek Hellenism.

What is worth remembering is not how the world favors the rich and powerful.

But **how far we've come towards leveling the playing field since then.**

We no longer live in the world of a ""Republic"" who was controlled by senators hand-picked from powerful families who employed slaves to run their household. We no longer live in a feudal world where aristocrats owned every stitch of land, running those lands like a business, and who ran Parliament like a corporate board meeting.

Instead, we now live in a world where individuals can invest in stocks, where people are allowed to start their own companies, and where entrepreneurship is actually praised rather than sneered at. (Once upon a time, Napoleon supposedly sneered at the UK as a ""nation of shopkeepers""--the idea being the little guy, the shopkeeper, is an inferior to the aristocratic class which Napoleon represented.)

----

In other words, in the competition between the aristocratic and powerful elite, and the common man, the common man has made serious inroads into the halls of power.

But it's not perfect, as you can see.

----

So don't fret that the rich and powerful have rigged the game. They've **always** rigged the game.

Instead, be cheered by the fact that the rich and powerful are losing ground to folks like us.",w3woody,3,/r/stocks/comments/l8b4pp/is_anyone_else_feeling_really_depressed_from_the/gldkck6/,0.063,0.74,0.198,0.9921

What u/DeepFuckingValue has taught us is invaluable. Never again will a company be able to be shorted like they did with GME. These events will never be forgotten. It might, but probably not, have consequences changing the entire industry. If not, it will inspire decentralized stockbrokers to become a thing through some kind of tokenization in the future. There will be a solution. Just like coordination could overthrow governments during the Arab Spring, so can it be used to redistribute money in society. The fact that we are just learning this now is mind-blowing, none-the-less, we can do anything. If we collectively do it, even if they wanna call it illegal at some point, whatever, it's not.

On top of that I am a female in my mid thirties originally from a “developing country” now living in a “first world country” so more than disappointed I’m mad. Mad because people like me never get financial education, as a woman you are never told to invest. Ever. And then everyone treats you like you don’t know what you are doing. On top of that where I live everyone is telling you to go with very conservative saving options like accounts that barely give you a 1-2% per year while most of the people get stuck with mortgages that will pay until they are 60 y/o and then there’s the stock market where you actually have a chance and then this happens. It makes my blood boil. But believe this, if you enjoy it, are good at it and like trading, keep doing it!

We volunteered for Bernie’s campaign, worked our hearts out for months, created SO much support without any billionaire or Wall Street donors. We knew it was an uneven playing field, but we thought we could overwhelm it through hard work and a plan that would benefit everybody. 

But when Wall Street feels threatened, they make calls. First there was the voting machine debacle in Iowa; it’s since come out there was tampering to disadvantage Bernie and the DNC was heavily involved. Then there was the constant smear jobs in the media, the blatant double standard where they refuse to call out other candidates who blatantly bald-faced lie during debates. When that didn’t kill momentum they started shutting down polling stations in progressive leaning areas. Finally they had all the candidates drop out and endorse Joe Biden right before Super Tuesday.

21,RH," I'm actually ecstatic about it. Then again I've always traded with the MM moves in mind and its a part of my trading plan to watch for their manipulations and even to get out when I start seeing certain that doesn't go with my trade analysis. I always knew that if you had a ton of money you could basically rig the technical analysis in your favor. I didn't know how deep that really went until this week when they pulled out EVERY filthy card they had and still lost to a bunch of nuts on an internet forum. 

To see these people flailing around trying to fix their own fuck up and that average people were the ones to band together and screw them over so hard that they made blatant fools out of themselves to protect their interests made me cackling like a maniac. To see most of the world, Democrat and Republican, foreign and domestic SEETHING about it and join in to buy and hold against these assholes made me almost weep with joy. I shed a tear at the end of yesterday. It snapped me out, if only for a while, from a string of depression thats been going on for a long while (unrelated to the market). I honestly can't recall the last time I felt this happy for such an extended amount of time. 

It is a free market, but maybe ""too free"". People with billions are allowed to do what they want too, which apparently includes:

1. owning a virtual monopoly on amateur investors and the money that fuels the trades that they make (Citadel is RH's largest MM so has a huge amount of sway. Some reports from anonymous people at RH are saying they believe that Citadel told RH to put the buy hold in but only after some shorts doubled down. Scant evidence, but of course their is.)

2. Have friends at CNBC apparently forget what a short squeeze is and spread essentially propaganda to try their best to convince people to stop ""for their best interests.""

3. Over leverage their accounts to the point that they could go billions in debt while retail traders can't. 

4. Trade amongst themselves to artificially deflate pricing and crash a market (which is what short sellers always do, just not as blatant as it was this week). 

5. Have servers closer to Wallstreet so that their orders get in milliseconds faster. 

6. Have their trades go through despite market conditions because they're best bros with their brokers while the average Joe gets throttled due to volatility. 

7. [Fill in the blank with whatever you're pissed about from this week. The list is endless.]

The SEC NEEDS to do something after today. They always knew that what they were doing wasn't fair but didn't have either the back bone or the support to do anything about it. 

The people showed their hand, didn't back down, and unless something terrifically stupid happens Monday have bankrupted a hedge fund and hit Wall Street where it hurts-- right in the wallet. This has shown many people that they're not powerless if we work together and showed wall street that they're not untouchable. They struck the fear of God into these people. 

Keep your chin up. I can't blame you for feeling the way you do. I would too if I hadn't already seen it for what it is, but try to think of it like this.

Despite the rigging of our financial freedoms YOU have beaten the market against all odds. Billionaires wanted YOUR money all this time and yet you've done well with your money in a tumultuous market and have taken profits yourself. Against all odds you've made this hobby of yours profitable and fun! Don't let this get you down and try to see it as a light in the darkness. This showed a lot of cracks and errors in the system.

31,GME," For anyone watching the GME situation (all of us?), consider these relevant points and taking the relevant actions:

 1. Big money is MORTIFIED and the retaliation is completely unprecedented: coordinated attacks, willingness to risk prison over financial loss, concealing data, etc. They're shaking because we're holding GME. Despite any other lack of information available, this may be the best signal for why you should hold. Period.

 2. After the massive GME rise, there was a LOT of bot activity trying to distract, dissuade, etc. They're poisoning the well, and it's difficult to know what can be trusted and what can't. The one thing we DEFINITELY know, however, is that all of those attacks are being done to make us sell GME and spin the narrative that the complicit agents are victims / good guys.

 3. Robinhood + Citadel are trying to spin a BS narrative. If your institution can't afford something, shut everything down equally and go bankrupt. Choosing a specific stock to shut down is perhaps the most egregiously corrupt action ever taken in the market (which is saying A LOT). YOU weren't allowed to buy when major funds were, especially at CRITICAL times with CRITICAL buying opportunities to protect Citadel + big money and it collectively cost us tens of billions in lost opportunity. They're being sued, and rightfully so, but laws need to change to ruthlessly punish them NOW. Contact your representatives, SEC, etc. if you haven't already.

 4. Hedges might lie about their short positions, or restrict visibility as much as possible. They can break laws and face negligible fees by comparison to the rest of what they stand to lose. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume they might do this among many other PR stunts to terrify you. Keep updated.

36,GME," It has been entertaining to watch, but I’m more anxious than ever for the hordes of Redditors who invested money based on WSB misunderstandings of how short squeezes work. 

I’ve posted several other places, but short interest >100% doesn’t indicate naked shorting. It just means some of the shorter shares have been re-shorted. The missing piece of information on WSB is that each short also creates a new long position, so long interest is also greater than 100%. 

A lot of people have a very simplistic idea of how hedge funds work, too. They can be long and short at the same time. They can also exit their short trades during the dips and re-enter the short at a higher price when the price increases again. They may even have machines walking their shorts up in price using the insane volatility we’re seeing.

Finally, several hedge funds are making billions on this run-up because they’re long GME and/or trading the volatility. Where does that money come from? Much of it is coming out of Redditor’s pockets because they’ve been told they can’t lose on this trade when they absolutely can (and many will).

I’m not a big investor but I bought some GME yesterday at $400.  It dipped to just under $200, and I went to buy more, but it was frozen (on webull).  I could sell but not buy.  Today I could buy again and it was at 300-350 most the day.

Because webull (and RH) halted buying I’m currently in the red, whereas if they hadn’t, I’d be in the black.

It’s discouraging that although the goal is to “buy low, sell high”, the major outlets for small time investors really only allowed the opposite.

50,GME," 33 as well! I learned a lot about the market since September. I was doing incredibly well in stocks and decided to go options. Did even better!. Took all my profits and went into Gamestop stock because after researching and checking it out I believed based on past console cycles that it could hit 25+. Bought a 150 at... let me see... 14.29 on the 25th of November. Wasn't moving fast enough for me after the rush of options. Sold for a loss. Bought up some 12/04 22c. That Monday it started rocketing and I sold those calls and made the best money I've ever made for the least amount of work. Then it kept rising and I fomo'd the majority of my account into 12/04 22c at a ridiculous premium right before it took a dive. Through the meager remainder into GME before pulling it out when I needed extra cash for Christmas. 

The thing is I knew and read that nothing was going to happen till late January or until April. I explained it to my previous roommate and tried to get him to invest in it but he refused. He called me all excited to ask how much I made this week. I had to explain it and it hurt. My girlfriend also asked how much I made off it and I had to explain it to her which sucked.

Moral of the story: I learned fomo buying is a terrible financial plan. Weekly options are fun but I'm more likely to lose than win on them. When I make a plan I need to stick with it. 

Here's the thing; I enjoyed how much I learned about the market. I enjoyed the research. I enjoyed watching plays work out or even lose.

53,ANY," I think we might be headed for a crash tbh despite the optimism other people are still feeling. But it'll be more like March 2020 than 2008. Quick and dirty and then back to earning money at a breakneck pace.

Here's why I think so and the process I envision:

1. We have them genuinely terrified. Something has changed and they know it. The shifting of the foundations beneath their feet and that feeling of losing control (they haven't lost control, but to someone who is used to getting everything they want, when they want it, ANY loss of control feels like an indignity) is going to make them more cautious.

2. Talk of being in a bubble has been increasing constantly the past few months. People were already on edge and there was an overall increase in skittishness..add this new uneasiness over the changing markets to the pile.

3. Stocks have been dumping all week, largely due to hedge funds needing liquidity, but red stocks and red futures have a powerful influence on the emotions of the average trader no matter the cause.

4. Things start to snowball rapidly, more stocks start dumping. Panic and a crash ensues.

5. Here's what's critical to the rapid turnaround I see: people won't end up chalking this up to the bubble bursting. After a month or so, when the dust settles, people won't blame overextended tech, they'll blame the GME drama (and they'll be partly right.) Having GME to blame for the market correction will make them feel more comfortable buying the dip and getting back in. A lot of people have become addicted to this very heady bull market, and whatever it takes to convince themselves it's time to buy up more stocks, they'll seize on. This isn't a bad thing, mind you. 

6. More stimulus is inbound, which in theory is already priced in but personally I think people have given up on (so it isn't priced in, not anymore, and that's why the market hasn't been all that perky since inauguration), and that will provide a nice dose of optimism.

56,GME," I just want to add one thing here to what others have said: Take a small amount of money that you can afford to lose, and have fun with some riskier investments. But build a stable base of total market/""safer"" index funds as mentioned below and treat it conservatively with regard to risk. But the risky stuff is what made it fun, and what motivated me to learn most of my knowledge about the markets. So understand the conservative advice about stable long-term growth first (/r/investing is a great place to start, but also books like The Simple Path to Wealth), but don't be afraid to play around a bit with smaller amounts of money. *Especially* if you're a ""learn by doing"" type of person like I am. I do stand by the need to ""understand the rules [of more-traditional investing] before you learn when to break them"" though.

One good piece of advice that stuck with me as well is ""always have a thesis"" for every investment. Say it to yourself out loud, write it down, etc. Just a simple ""I believe GME will rise to $420.69 by next week because WSB says it will and I read some confusing stuff about Short Interest"" (sorry lol had to).

80,GME," Hi friend,

I am in no way a financial advisor and I do understand this is more about a push back against the billionaires than it is about the money, but if selling 2 shares for $500 or more could help immensely then I would definitely sell as soon as possible.  

For one, the hedge funds have likely gotten out or at least hedged against their losses by now so any additional increase won’t hurt them.  

But second, it is basically an objective fact that GME will be back to $10 at some point in time, it may be next year, but it also could be next week.  

If you do sell and it doubles in value before collapsing don’t lose sleep over it, I assure you that you will never time the market perfectly. 

The best way to start is to put whatever you can in a mutual fund every month and forget that it’s even there.  Then when/if your balance hits 5 figures you can play around with a couple hundred dollars on individual stocks like you are now. 

This GME story this week was fascinating and refreshing, but I do fear this meme convinced a lot of people to jump when the stock was already $200+ and they’re the ones that will lose in the end, just this time they’ll lose to the 10%ers instead of the 1%ers.",nomorecowardlypunts,7,/r/stocks/comments/l8b4pp/is_anyone_else_feeling_really_depressed_from_the/gld0gx9/,0.109,0.716,0.175,0.9655

 1. Big money is MORTIFIED and the retaliation is completely unprecedented: coordinated attacks, willingness to risk prison over financial loss, concealing data, etc. They're shaking because we're holding GME. Despite any other lack of information available, this may be the best signal for why you should hold. Period.

 2. After the massive GME rise, there was a LOT of bot activity trying to distract, dissuade, etc. They're poisoning the well, and it's difficult to know what can be trusted and what can't. The one thing we DEFINITELY know, however, is that all of those attacks are being done to make us sell GME and spin the narrative that the complicit agents are victims / good guys.

 3. Robinhood + Citadel are trying to spin a BS narrative. If your institution can't afford something, shut everything down equally and go bankrupt. Choosing a specific stock to shut down is perhaps the most egregiously corrupt action ever taken in the market (which is saying A LOT). YOU weren't allowed to buy when major funds were, especially at CRITICAL times with CRITICAL buying opportunities to protect Citadel + big money and it collectively cost us tens of billions in lost opportunity. They're being sued, and rightfully so, but laws need to change to ruthlessly punish them NOW. Contact your representatives, SEC, etc. if you haven't already.

 4. Hedges might lie about their short positions, or restrict visibility as much as possible. They can break laws and face negligible fees by comparison to the rest of what they stand to lose. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume they might do this among many other PR stunts to terrify you. Keep updated. Someone pointed out that iborrowdesk is no longer reporting on updated gme because, again, the legal consequences don't matter enough and they're protecting their interests. Refer to #1.

 5. We don't know WHEN short positions will be covered, only the math that requires them to cover as we move forward. So if they delay and everyone gives in, they could save a lot of money. However, the longer they delay, the more they have to pay. So it's a matter of whether or not they double down and face higher risk/reward or not. Be prepared to WAIT.

 6. If you set visible limits, the hedge funds can use this data to their advantage and potentially have attack vectors against us. However, if you don't set limits, you might miss out on major trading spikes when they happen. The selfless act is to avoid low limits, but the ultimate goal is to distribute wealth to the people so take if you're the people who need it.

 7. If you're angry at Robinhood, move accounts AFTER this is over so that you're not frozen. Also, DO NOT transfer to your bank, because that will trigger a tax event. You're supposed to transfer between brokers. Look into this further yourself, since I'm not a tax expert.

96,GME," Hi, some stupid questions from a noob who is trying to learn a bit more about how this works. Hoping someone with a bit of knowledge might be able to answer me.

I've been reading up a bit, and from what I understand the Estimated Short Interest on GME has hovered around 70 million USD for the last few days, with an apparent drop to 38 million friday according to ortex.com. 

So, over the course of say 4 weeks, that would be an interest of anywhere between 760 - 1400 million. At the same time, covering all the outstanding shorts at the current share price, would roughly be 17 billion. If the share price were to fall to say $250 however, it would already be 4 billion less. Doesn't that mean that essentially mean that for the short sellers, the best proposition is to just pay the interest for a month or two, hoping the price goes down? I mean, trying to close the position now would only drive up the share price and their daily expenditure no? 

Also, what makes people think the price might go up to say $1,000 or $5,000? I understand the fundamental idea of dictating the price because of scarcity, but I just don't understand why the short sellers would come into a position where they ""have"" to buy. As I understand it, these shorts don't expire. So what mechanism are people pointing at that forces short sellers to try and close out their position? Is it because the broker will want the shares back because they think the liquidity of the short seller is becoming in question?

Could be that I'm missing something very obvious here, or getting some basic stuff wrong. As I said, I don't really know much about this, but now that I'm ""in"" (just a few shares, if it evaporates it's fine), I'd like to understand it better.

Edit: Also, Melvin Capital apparently manages about 13 billion in assets and they got an injection of 2,5 billion. That makes me think that if the stock stays anywhere near these levels, they will simply go bankrupt instead of covering their shorts? There may be other short sellers apparently, but ultimately, the money has to come from somewhere and if the squeeze happens and people want to convert, will it not simply be that the short sellers will not be able to cover their position at all?",mistervanilla,94,/r/stocks/comments/l8rhr3/weekend_gme_thread_homework_for_all_lets_stop/gle473k/,0.044,0.868,0.088,0.9261

This was temporary and lasted only for the afternoon of trading and persisted into the after-hours.

This was Wednesday morning 9-10am, Thursday morning again, same time, and intermittently Friday morning same time (but not on every single attempt I made to put in an order).

One thing people don't seem to realize is that they don't have to liquidate their positions to move to fidelity. They can open an account, and fund it however, with a check, ACH transfer, etc, and be able to trade instantly. If you have a Robinhood or other brokerage account, you can also (or instead) have the contents of the account transferred in, stocks, bonds and all. You just follow the transfer account process.

I’m stuck between 2 options for switching brokers: 

1) after the short squeeze, initiate an ACAT transfer from robinhood to fidelity. 

2) On Monday, liquidate all my assets in Robinhood except GME, withdraw funds to bank, open brokerage account with fidelity and deposit the equity I had there. 

My main concerns are timing and having access to my trades. The ACAT transfer would definitely be the most convenient, and probably the same amount of time/slightly quicker. But, I’m not sure how robinhood is going to be financially after everything is said and done. (Bankruptcy?)

You could've also had people freeriding under reg T (I've seen it, people complaining about the 90 day freeze in WSB), which would cause additional issues, and robinhood would *still* have to back the trades, even though it's a ""cash account""

Similiar (but obviously not the same, just giving a very light example) to how a bank wouldn't be able to give out cash to everyone if they came to withdrawal their accounts at the same time, even though it's ""your"" money.

However what actually happened was a coordinated counter effort by the hedge funds against the GME longs by providing us with lots of buying opportunities scattered across the market. 

Why does this make sense? Because all the GME longs are now seeing their superstar stock start to sink in a sea of red and since the golden rule of investing is to buy low and sell high they want retail traders to sell their GME positions (to free up shares so they can short their way out of this mess) and to buy something else.",quick_pwn,4,/r/stocks/comments/l8mk8v/gme_second_act_margin_call_explained_amc_other/gldvntn/,0.019,0.871,0.11,0.9136

I took an estimate of the interest paid by shorts just for holding through the weekend.  Depending on interest rate (https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME has it at 32.8%), there will be $30-40 million in interest paid, just for the two day weekend.  That creates upward pressure.

I also think retail holders have the ability to make a difference in the size of the float.  When Robinhood removes the 1 share cap, assuming all trades settle early this week, and the clearing houses return to normal.  This is a worldwide phenomenon.  I saw posts about hearing about GME on rural Nova Scotia radio and in Norwegian newspaper headlines.  70 million people worldwide purchasing 1 share buys the entire total of outstanding shares.  The same for 14 million people buying 5 shares.  People want to be part of history. Normally people buying 1-5 shares doesn’t make a difference.  This time it does.

Shorters will get margin called and be forced to buy stocks that are in limited supply. They will have to pay any sell limit. This in turn causes more and more shorts to be margin called further pushing up the price. The price will fall after the short sellers purchase 140% of the float.

If we ignore the short squeeze, who in their right mind buys GME @ 300? Everyone has a selling point and the whole rage seems to be $1000, and this whole hold your shares so no one can cover attitude is likely to fail and then you become the bag holder.

281,DD," High enough that I haven’t pulled money out. Even foregoing all of the reported values of 70-113% shorted stock left and the fact that their interest is ridiculously high we can look at it from the psychological perspective. They risked jail time for this when they shut down trade. They’ve been hitting the market with two short ladder attacks A DAY. They’ve been running ADVERTISEMENTS to say that they’re perfectly fine. Now idk about you but if I was “perfectly fine” I wouldn’t pay ad money to try to convince the people that I wasn’t vulnerable to. They’ve manipulated the media - most obviously CNBC - to claim that everything is fine. The subreddit was bombarded with bots. The discord was shut down once and then hacked another time. Doesn’t sound like someone who isn’t worried. If anything it sounds like someone who is about to lose their ass and knows that a $100 million cost of business fine would be worth it if they could stop hemorrhaging billions of dollars. On top of that there’s the issue that the math is still compounding with how they have allegedly shorted some of the stock that they used to make the ladder on Friday and even that wasn’t enough to stop the $115 options from coming through. So do I think that there will be a squeeze? Absolutely. The question remaining is when and how long will it take to cover. I won’t address the second bit because there’s plenty of DD on that in the sub but I believe that it’ll be Tuesday afternoon at latest considering that they’re losing $30 mill daily on interest now from estimation. How high and how far the squeeze goes is a matter of math and human psychology. We’re in the game theory now and all they’re tactics to break retail’s commitment have failed (yes even after many of us lost 80%) so the line is strong. I think it’s because they’ve managed to do one of the dumbest things that they could’ve done to an American: they fucked with our free market.

305,GME," A company doesn’t gain from having a high stock price, existing owners who sell get the money not the company.  

If the company sells brand new shares, they get the money directly and existing shares are worth less.  Tesla, for example, has used its high price to issue new shares before.  But there might not be enough demand, at current price, for GME to raise a ton of money that way.

Another way a company can benefit from a high stock price is borrowing with the stock value of the company as collateral.  But lenders know this price is a bubble.",advester,3,/r/stocks/comments/l8fcbm/an_oversimplified_look_at_the_gme_situation/gldmqf6/,0.0,0.823,0.177,0.94

This analogy is nonsense. You act like small time investors who frequent Reddit are the only people long on this stock. You also act like people don't have real lives where major expenses come up and they have to liquidate most of their investments to cover them.

And u are gonna get ur orders out before the market comes insanely crashing down before the computers.

Which u wont, and the retailers dont get this.

What will trigger the 90% fall is that computers are set to sell out on a certain value, let say the hegdefund (on the buyer side) as that at 600.

So first spike is like 300-500. halted

This will make it jump to like 500-700.

This will sell it - halted

500-300

halted

300-100 

halted.

this is probably the pattern. You as retail have to be able to sell out before the computers are triggered and u dont know if that is at 300,400,500 or higher.

If you buy a put you are betting the stock goes down. As we all know if you buy an option that is your max loss. So buying an option is defined risk. 

When you short a stock you borrow it and sell it but you owe someone the shares back. They have to buy shares back to close their position. 

WSB’s noted that the hedge funds had their dick in the cookie jar so they started buying stock at like $30-40 per share to prevent the shorts from getting the shares forcing them to hold their position which is expensive. 

I think the hedge funds went short at like 15-20. The stock is like 300. So the shorts have lost so they have lost 15-20 Times their initial investment. 

GME has a Market Capitalization of $22B RIGHT NOW. the stock is worth $12.83. The company is really worth like a Billion. Maybe more. My point is that the shorts lost like $70B on GME. Ouch.

405,GME," Here's a bear argument:

I invested heavily into GME at $17. I'm completely sold of at $300. So I was very bullish, but I had to sell-off for one reason: Price movement is no longer connected to supply and demand. This is due to illegal activity on behalf of MMs and brokers and hedge funds, not the actual demand. I have no idea what illegal thing they will do next, and with such a large investment, I had to sell. I'm bearish because of risk. What if the SEC does shut down GME, restrict all forms of trading? Obviously this shouldn't fix problems, but what if these fundamental issues are just fixed by more illegal activity or even government bailout?

I don't know, which is why I couldn't remain any longer. Illegal activity isn't predictable or defensible, outside of lawsuits and things.

439,ALL," Sure, happy to explain.

Just one note, citadel and citadel securities are separate entities. They are only allowed to open long positions, they are not allowed to short the stock. Just because they invested in Melving does not mean they shorted GME, melvin closed their position on Tuesday. Citadel was just able to buy a portion of a hedge fund for cheap because of the losses they incurred.

DTCC, the clearinghouse for WeBull, Robinhood and other brokerages, recently raised the collateral requirements for GameStop transactions to nearly 100%.

When RH takes a buy order it goes to it's clearinghouse to exchange it's clients money for shares. The shares are immediately and conveniently transferred to the client, but the funds aren’t transferred for 2 days. There's this gap between the broker and the clearinghouse for these unsettled trades that the clearinghouse will require some cash upfront (margin) for but otherwise accepts exposure for the rest.

If the stock being bought is extremely volatile, expensive and has a huge amount of recent volume and therefore unsettled trades, the clearinghouse will eventually realize they are floating quite a lot more to the broker than they are comfortable with on the back of a very risky equity. GME fits all these characteristics.
It's this point in the GME scenario where DTCC sets margin requirements to 100%. They tell their brokers, ""Hey if you want to get GME stock from us, we will not accept your word that this trade will settle in two days. Instead we need the money upfront since we are already way too exposed to this one ticker from you.""

Now, if Robinhood wants to continue filling buy orders for it's clients it needs to come up with ALL the money for each trade. RH does not have nearly enough cash on hand to handle this, hence the recent draw down from of Robinhood's credit lines as they try to get enough liquidity to keep buying shares for their clients.
Eventually the brokers just don't have enough cash, throw in the towel and stop accepting buy orders until they can settle more trades or the clearinghouses release the margin requirements for these stocks.

The concept that Robinhood would fuck over basically their entire user base on purpose to help a minority investor's minority investment in a hedge fund that already closed their fucking short position doesn't stand up to even the smallest amount of scrutiny.

441,RH," Sure, happy to explain.

Just one note, citadel and citadel securities are separate entities. They are only allowed to open long positions, they are not allowed to short the stock. Just because they invested in Melving does not mean they shorted GME, melvin closed their position on Tuesday. Citadel was just able to buy a portion of a hedge fund for cheap because of the losses they incurred.

DTCC, the clearinghouse for WeBull, Robinhood and other brokerages, recently raised the collateral requirements for GameStop transactions to nearly 100%.

When RH takes a buy order it goes to it's clearinghouse to exchange it's clients money for shares. The shares are immediately and conveniently transferred to the client, but the funds aren’t transferred for 2 days. There's this gap between the broker and the clearinghouse for these unsettled trades that the clearinghouse will require some cash upfront (margin) for but otherwise accepts exposure for the rest.

If the stock being bought is extremely volatile, expensive and has a huge amount of recent volume and therefore unsettled trades, the clearinghouse will eventually realize they are floating quite a lot more to the broker than they are comfortable with on the back of a very risky equity. GME fits all these characteristics.
It's this point in the GME scenario where DTCC sets margin requirements to 100%. They tell their brokers, ""Hey if you want to get GME stock from us, we will not accept your word that this trade will settle in two days. Instead we need the money upfront since we are already way too exposed to this one ticker from you.""

Now, if Robinhood wants to continue filling buy orders for it's clients it needs to come up with ALL the money for each trade. RH does not have nearly enough cash on hand to handle this, hence the recent draw down from of Robinhood's credit lines as they try to get enough liquidity to keep buying shares for their clients.

They’re considered [Tesla’s biggest competitor](https://www.fool.ca/2020/09/23/new-tesla-competitor-you-wont-believe-which-stock-it-is/).

624,BB," Entirely possible, but I doubt the entire market will join in with Apple. BB has a sterling security reputation, especially with Western Governments. The Canadian Government still uses BBM and grants its a Protected B approval. In contrast Office isn't allowed any protected Communications.

BB also hold user security with the upmost respect. They will not give over your data for no reason, and had to exit India because of it.

Sure there is a ton of competition within the Auto Sector, but QNX is becoming a very popular programming base in the Automotive sector. Ford  shifted from Microsoft Auto to QNX in 2014. Ford also has similar long term visions for the Vehicle and interconnected cities as BB.

In contrast GM and Honda (partners for 3 EVs currently in development) both use Android Automotive to run their head units. GM has publically committed past 2021 as well. But in the past have used QNX. 

Other automakers currently using QNX include VW (Audi, Porsche and Volkswagen), Hyundai/KIA, BMW, Mercedes, Toyota, Land Cruiser and Jaguar. 

All these companies will be looking to streamline costs and BB is a legitimate player in the game. A major concern moving into the new era of vehicles is security. Apple and Google both have shown to be great in that regard, but BB was always the strongest in that arena. It wasn't enough to help establish supremacy, but people are going to take car security far more seriously than mobile security. 

At least I'd hope. 

Further on, Amazon buying into IVY is huge news, and if the rollout is promising, I'd expect it to seamlessly move over to Ford, VW Group and Rivian vehicles. Since those groups are all partnering together on development of EV technology. 

Ford is taking the software side of the company very seriously. The Sync 4 system for the Mach E was panned as the weakest part of the vehicle at showings, and they sacked their CEO over it. Their new CEO is all about inutive Software for their vehicles. 

If the QNX base is strong enough, and devolpers aren't limited by it, IVY will be able to slide right into these systems. 

There are a metric shitton of variable that can go either way, and over the next year or two probably will go both ways. However the potential upside is worth the risk. 

I've decided to go with 20% BB (hoping to average down if it drops below $10), and another 20% in Ford. The F150 E will be the tipping point for EVs and demand is going to be insane. People also fail to recognize how Ford has a strong fincial arm as well. Until COVID they always payed strong dividends, and their willingness to enter the EV market with such strong platforms is exciting. 

No offense to Nissan/Renault, but the Leaf is kinda and always has kinda been lame. The Volt/Bolt from GM were failures because they were just so uninspired. Ford will be the first true competitor to Tesla in the market in terms of platform and their partnership with BB helps strengthen their hands. 

Overall BB is a long term hold, and not something you should go all in on looking to get rich quick.

627,GM," Entirely possible, but I doubt the entire market will join in with Apple. BB has a sterling security reputation, especially with Western Governments. The Canadian Government still uses BBM and grants its a Protected B approval. In contrast Office isn't allowed any protected Communications.

BB also hold user security with the upmost respect. They will not give over your data for no reason, and had to exit India because of it.

Sure there is a ton of competition within the Auto Sector, but QNX is becoming a very popular programming base in the Automotive sector. Ford  shifted from Microsoft Auto to QNX in 2014. Ford also has similar long term visions for the Vehicle and interconnected cities as BB.

In contrast GM and Honda (partners for 3 EVs currently in development) both use Android Automotive to run their head units. GM has publically committed past 2021 as well. But in the past have used QNX. 

Other automakers currently using QNX include VW (Audi, Porsche and Volkswagen), Hyundai/KIA, BMW, Mercedes, Toyota, Land Cruiser and Jaguar. 

All these companies will be looking to streamline costs and BB is a legitimate player in the game. A major concern moving into the new era of vehicles is security. Apple and Google both have shown to be great in that regard, but BB was always the strongest in that arena. It wasn't enough to help establish supremacy, but people are going to take car security far more seriously than mobile security. 

At least I'd hope. 

Further on, Amazon buying into IVY is huge news, and if the rollout is promising, I'd expect it to seamlessly move over to Ford, VW Group and Rivian vehicles. Since those groups are all partnering together on development of EV technology. 

Ford is taking the software side of the company very seriously. The Sync 4 system for the Mach E was panned as the weakest part of the vehicle at showings, and they sacked their CEO over it. Their new CEO is all about inutive Software for their vehicles. 

If the QNX base is strong enough, and devolpers aren't limited by it, IVY will be able to slide right into these systems. 

There are a metric shitton of variable that can go either way, and over the next year or two probably will go both ways. However the potential upside is worth the risk. 

I've decided to go with 20% BB (hoping to average down if it drops below $10), and another 20% in Ford. The F150 E will be the tipping point for EVs and demand is going to be insane. People also fail to recognize how Ford has a strong fincial arm as well. Until COVID they always payed strong dividends, and their willingness to enter the EV market with such strong platforms is exciting. 

No offense to Nissan/Renault, but the Leaf is kinda and always has kinda been lame. The Volt/Bolt from GM were failures because they were just so uninspired. Ford will be the first true competitor to Tesla in the market in terms of platform and their partnership with BB helps strengthen their hands. 

Overall BB is a long term hold, and not something you should go all in on looking to get rich quick. But as a risky investment that will likely lose in the short term, but has tremendous upside over the long term.

future potential hinges mostly on their willingness to now transition to online retail with the guidance of the ryan cohen and the other two board members that came over from chewy

another potential advantage is using valuable brick and mortar locations in the way walmart does in order to compete with amazon (i can expand on this if youre not too familiar with walmarts recent success in competing with amazon)

>Failure to deliver means that one of the counterparties (in this case, the firm who sold you the option, RH or the clearing house) has failed to deliver you a contractually obligated position, profit or certificate. Since there's no float and ITM calls get exercised by HFT bots at the end of the day, how in the fucking hell are they gonna deliver the option holders their contractually obligated merchandise if there is no merchandise to be delivered? There simply isn't enough for everyone. Thousands (or possibly hundreds of thousands) of failures to deliver = big risk

Correct me if I'm wrong, but as I understand it, RH and other brokers act to facilitate the sale of shares. So if you want to buy 10 shares of GME at $300 each, you put in your buy order to your broker. This is basically you telling RH that you would like to purchase 10 GME for $300. They accept your order and place that order on the market, which in this case is with NASDAQ. There, many other brokers are doing the same thing for their customers, that is, placing their buy orders and sell orders with NASDAQ. 

On the NASDAQ exchange, they will try to match your buy order for 10 GME @$300 with someone else that has put in a sell order for $300. Once a suitable seller is found, the transaction occurs and RH will move those shares into your account and transfer your money to the seller via their broker. RH and the seller's broker earn a commission in facilitating this sale.

Now if your order has been accepted by RH and gone to the market, but no suitable seller can be found, because say no one is selling, or because all the sellers want more than $300 for their shares, then your order doesn't get filled and it just stays there. The order remains there until a seller comes along willing to sell you their GME shares for $300.

So what I don't get is that if there aren't any available shares, then why would that matter to brokers such as RH? How are they at risk of not delivering the GME shares? Because if they can't find a seller, then your order is still incomplete. It's not like you place your order and they take your money and then promise to give you the shares. They only take your money once a seller has been found. They only earn a commission once the transaction has gone ahead. If a seller can't be found, then no commission is paid by the customer to the broker.

Therefore, how can this set up a situation where there is a failure to deliver?",goldenage768,2,/r/stocks/comments/l8i72x/can_we_please_stop_the_misinformation/glcy6kx/,0.059,0.85,0.091,0.9409

The linked article is a great explanation, but it doesn’t capture the point that running out of shares IS the goal of WSB.  They want the share price to push to absurd levels, it’s purely a momentum play over there.  

I would say WSB is mad at the right thing for the wrong reason.  They are mad because they think RH is doing something nefarious to help institutional money, when in fact they just got told by their middle man that orders won’t be filled.  What they SHOULD be mad about is the communication from RH, because if they had just come out and said publicly our clearing is struggling to find shares, that would have added more fuel to the short squeeze fire than any celebrity could have.

So say you've bought a call option that expires today. You've bought 1 contract @50. Someone has to have sold you that contract, in this case we will call him the seller. The contract expires and it's ITM and you tell your broker you want to exercise that contract. This means you will pay $5,000 to receive 100 shares of GME. So your broker (RH) has to go and get those 100 shares for you from the market. The current price of GME is $350. Now the seller of that contact has to pay for those shares to give to you. This will cost them $35,000. They're responsible for paying this, not their broker, not the clearing house. So how is the clearing house at risk?

If there's a lack of supply of shares on the market, then when the seller's broker goes to buy the 100 shares, this will drive the price up right?

No matter which of these is true, the conclusion is the same: you should stop using Robinhood. Most online brokerages will allow you to transfer your assets from Robinhood.

They either:

When there are far bigger brokerages that now also offer no commission.

(3) are make money off you: you are the product, not the customer. It's clear their revenue is charging money makers to see your orders and tweaking order flow to their benefit. Again, why be taken advantage of when other brokerages are less ethically challenged?

(4) they lie: Vlad went on TV saying they restricted trading because of ""SEC regulations."" What? Then why didn't every other brokerage (Fidelity, M1, etc.) Every brokerage is well stocked with securities lawyers, so why didn't they all restrict trading.

(5) Volatility is their weakness: you may not remember, but they shut down trading last March and you couldn't access your money or sell during days when the market was collapsing by 9%.

874,GME," May have been good for all retail perhaps, but it's sure bad as hell for everyone on reddit stock communities that were here before the GME excitement. And it sure isn't good for all the idiots I see now on Facebook and Instagram talking about how they put all their money in crap like Doge, or whatever the hell people have been pumping with the headline of: ""let's take this to x!""

The reddit investment communities were fending off pump schemes all the time. Even in wsb, it was fought. Now they have 4million new members who all think this is all a pump game and every post is the same.

The spectrum of investment communities here went from conservative investors (r/investing) to highly risky speculative investors (r/wsb), but everyone actively reinforced the fundamental concept that we're all playing independently at our own risk. And even in places like wsb where everyone talked like an idiot, it was only a facade- before this influx. That community was a collection of investors who wanted to act juvenile and play a little more risky,  in order to take advantage of the bullish recovery. Now it's a mob of juveniles who jumped in on a huge wave and think they are investors. 

A month ago, if you asked for any advice in wsb, the response you would have received would have either been some total bullshit funny joke, or a suggestion to go to one of the other investment subs to learn from them. Now everyone is ""teaching"" everyone on how to quickly get rich. However that ""teaching"" is nothing more than steps on how to help pump a stock. 

And now, everywhere I go for my DDs, is flooding with nothing more than ""short squeeze"" hypothesis that rely on mass momentum. It's no longer about identifying hidden opportunities that exist via natural market forces, which is what we all actually rely on to make real investment decisions- risky or conservative ones.

I don't blame retail for this or all the idiots that flooded reddit to pump the next stock. I specifically blame Melvin and Andrew Left for making an absolutely irresponsible and grossly negligent play, then making it a public spectacle when they chose to double down instead of cutting their losses. Now because of their bullshit, we have what we have here today.

889,GME," To answer in order:

\- Both Melvin and Citron reported closing their initial short positions ([ref](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-27/melvin-capital-closes-out-its-gamestop-position-cnbc-reports).) Not sure if they entered into new short positions after, but it was reported they both closed at a loss.

\- No idea. Maybe try and get a poll going over there.

\- Complex question. You would need to know how many outstanding shorts are presently open, then multiply that volume with the share price. You would also need to know who owns the short position and how much capital they have at their expense. Not sure this answer is possible.

\- For every buyer there is a seller. Hypothetically, if every shareholder decides that they are only willing to sell for $500, then that becomes market price per share. However, what if nobody wants to buy at $500? One shareholder decides to sell and finds a buyer at $450. That makes $450 the market price. This cycle continues in either direction as buyers and sellers determine the price they are willing to buy/sell.

The problem with the GME move is it's not tied to fundamentals and it's become manipulated and inflated to levels beyond what most would consider reasonable market value. With that said, each shareholder has every right to set their sell price. If nobody is willing to buy, then it simply won't get filled.",InfinitusStultorum,5,/r/stocks/comments/l855cz/is_there_enough_money_to_be_squeezed_out_for/glb4c61/,0.069,0.871,0.059,-0.1088
890,GME," They shorted 146% of the shares. Which means they owe more shares than what currently exist. This means they will have to purchase a share multiple times in order to cover their positions.

There will almost certainly be bag holders left, who threw a couple grand in and lose it. But with 146% shorted that number will be lower than normal because hedges will be buying it at any price. The conversation about GME has shifted from ""we can make so much money"" to ""we can make those fuckers lose so much money"".

899,CEO," I think there are several reasons, though it's just a guess, since I don't work for them. Firstly, they all play the short game too, and nobody wants to be the next target.

Blackrock and Morgan Stanley bigwigs echoed that sentiment, and I'm sure others did too.

Secondly, these funds manage trillions in assets. They stand to lose a lot more from the red waves we've had in the past few days, caused in part by hedge funds desperately closing their shorts, than what they could gain from a single stock. It's in their interest to stop the bleeding too.

Finally, they're Wall Street buddies, and in a perceived ""class warfare"" such as this one, the institutions will back each other against the retail investors. You might think it's a silly argument, but these people are neighbors, coworkers, family, they go to meetings and dinners together, they're IB chat business besties.

909,BB," So here is my take and i am an idiot so consider that.

GME was the huge opportunity at making crazy money with squeeze potential. It reached a price per share people no longer wanted to to invest despite the squeeze not having happened yet. People turned to other stocks looking for the next short squeeze. BB and NOK were both plugged early on leading to quite rapid increases in their stock price however did not generate the same level of interest as either gme or amc. The public does not have enough money/power to force 3-5 short squeezes simultaneously and I imagine BB and NOK having been easier to manipulate by hedge funds with less resistance from the public.

In my opinion both are decent long term plays but short term probably going to see a lot of people bag carrying unless people move on to them once GME has been finished however I am not sure this will be the case.

Either 1 of 2 scenarios play out in my head.. and by no means I’m a financial expert but it’s what logically makes sense to me..

1.	The short squeeze happens, the stock shoots up to a few thousand dollars and bankrupts some hedge funds.. they’re forced to liquidate all of their holdings including blue chip stocks, etc. causing downward pressure on the market.. this triggers people’s stop losses, bearish sentiment, etc. causing a larger cascading effect
2.	the hedge funds wait it out, they sell off their other holdings in blue chips, etc. to pay off the interest on the shorts and cover the losses of closing their older shorts and take out new shorts.. this goes on for a while causing downward pressure on the market.. this triggers people’s stop losses, bearish sentiment, etc. causing a larger cascading effect",SlicedMango,46,/r/stocks/comments/l8l1h7/my_prediciton_on_what_will_happen/glda71t/,0.161,0.8,0.039,-0.9686

956,GME," It’s uncharted territory. Has there ever been a squeeze on a 100%+ SI? The VW SI was 99%. Looking back at that chart there was a peak and dip. I speculate people covered old shorts and added new ones then. But Porsche kept holding until the infinity spike; actually longer, they still have controlling interest of VW.

The unpredictable could happen, which has a lot of people scared. I kept hearing on CNBC yesterday that GME won’t spill to the broader market, it’s contained. But it already has a bit.

The shorts might ride it out, they might also get greedy double down some more. 

More shares have been sold than exist to buy, it’ll be difficult to unwind the synthetic shorts without causing a price spike.

957,GME," I think you're right that greed will cause the whole thing to collapse quite abruptly. I sold most of my small amount of GME yesterday for a roughly 100% gain (held on to a couple shares to see what happens) because I figured it was better to make pretty good gains rather than hope for astronomical gains. The timing of selling at an astronomical high seemed too precise to be really practical, and even if I did manage that, the amount I'd make wouldn't be life changing. I had 8-10 shares, so if it hits a $1000/share I have $10k. That's great but not life changing. 

I assume that there's a fair number of people like me, who had enough to get in for the ride, but are going to try to be practical about taking profits. As I've been learning about the stock market it seems like most of the advice preaches consistent gains over time rather than one huge jackpot.

In 2008 the VW short squeeze made VW the most valuable company in the world for a SINGLE DAY. People with unrealistic expectations are going to get burned, bad.

Here's why: Apple TV and LG TV's having Stadia.   


You can Bluetooth an xbox or PS controller to an apple TV to use apple arcade and play games there. Yeah, it doesn't have the same capabilities as an xbox or PS5 yet...but not far off. I believe the next gen console, won't be a console at all. Sony could potentially survive if they bake it into their TV's...but what's that mean for Microsoft...probably more reliance on PC.   


If gamestop were to pivot to be something like a steam, or stadia I think that it could be a decent company, but I think its a bit far fetched to think they can totally pivot to be a PC parts company.

Here's why: Apple TV and LG TV's having Stadia.   


You can Bluetooth an xbox or PS controller to an apple TV to use apple arcade and play games there. Yeah, it doesn't have the same capabilities as an xbox or PS5 yet...but not far off. I believe the next gen console, won't be a console at all. Sony could potentially survive if they bake it into their TV's...but what's that mean for Microsoft...probably more reliance on PC.   


If gamestop were to pivot to be something like a steam, or stadia I think that it could be a decent company, but I think its a bit far fetched to think they can totally pivot to be a PC parts company. The supply on chips and GPU is so low now no one can get them without a shopping cart bot online or standing in a long line at a store. It would be near impossible for them to get supply.

DTCC, the clearinghouse for WeBull, Robinhood and other brokerages, recently raised the collateral requirements for GameStop transactions to nearly 100%.

When RH takes a buy order it goes to it's clearinghouse to exchange it's clients money for shares. The shares are immediately and conveniently transferred to the client, but the funds aren’t transferred for 2 days. There's this gap between the broker and the clearinghouse for these unsettled trades that the clearinghouse will require some cash upfront (margin) for but otherwise accepts exposure for the rest.

If the stock being bought is extremely volatile, expensive and has a huge amount of recent volume and therefore unsettled trades, the clearinghouse will eventually realize they are floating quite a lot more to the broker than they are comfortable with on the back of a very risky equity. GME fits all these characteristics.
It's this point in the GME scenario where DTCC sets margin requirements to 100%. They tell their brokers, ""Hey if you want to get GME stock from us, we will not accept your word that this trade will settle in two days. Instead we need the money upfront since we are already way too exposed to this one ticker from you.""

Now, if Robinhood wants to continue filling buy orders for it's clients it needs to come up with ALL the money for each trade. RH does not have nearly enough cash on hand to handle this, hence the recent draw down from of Robinhood's credit lines as they try to get enough liquidity to keep buying shares for their clients.
Eventually the brokers just don't have enough cash, throw in the towel and stop accepting buy orders until they can settle more trades or the clearinghouses release the margin requirements for these stocks.

The concept that Robinhood would fuck over basically their entire user base on purpose to help a minority investor's minority investment in a hedge fund that already closed their fucking short position doesn't stand up to even the smallest amount of scrutiny. It's just a boring case of the market plumping going wild because it's not built to handle pumps of this scale.",MichKOG,12,/r/stocks/comments/l8h5cz/future_of_the_us_economy/glcoeza/,0.055,0.853,0.092,0.9157

**Thursday:** Stocks were back up \~1.2% and GME was going through a crazy ride (I think the day range was like $115 to $480.... totally normal....sheesh).

**Friday:** Stocks were back down 2.0%. I don't know what other news there was today as I've been busy with work and Resin printing.

Those are not unusual fluctuations but.... we know some liquidation is occurring but not to what degree of that movement is from other liquidation and what degree are other (maybe worse) factors.

For me, personally, I'll be holding for now. CRSR is in it's usual limbo game of $35 - $45 but I am putting a sell order in at \~$42 to profit take (bought at $18 and change). PTON has actually been up this week overall so I'll hold onto it. I don't see a better 6-month stock to hold that I want to take the 7% (maybe more) hit for holding it less than a year.

1117,EV," The thing I like about investing into the stock market is that I can apply the knowledge that I gain from reading news, reports, and opinions, I can apply in real world to make money.
For example, I want to invest in hydrogen fuel cell, well great what do I buy? Is there a market for it? Is the auto industry heading towards that change? Once I answer those questions and I like the results then I’ll look at companies that are leading the research into it. Take Plug as an example. They are promising hydrogen fuel cell company. Now I want to see what the research analyst are saying and how their finances are. 
The analyst usually give an opinion if it’s a good buy and what the target price can be. Based on that report and understanding there finances I will buy their stocks. It’s also good to google financial lingo like EBITDA, Income, Expenses, TAM, etc... These reports will talk in this financial lingo which Overtime you’ll learn.

Similarly if I’m interested in EV cars, or tech companies like Palantir or Apple, or payment companies like PayPal, or even dating companies like Match ill research those and buy it I think they have good case.

1136,OR," Let me preface this by saying the strategy I'm laying out is for **long** term investing. There's also a big difference between *investing* and *trading*, the biggest difference being timeframe. To me (and I'm sure it's the same for a lot of people), investing is long term, whereas trading is short term. Where exactly the line is drawn is up for debate. 

---

First and foremost: do you have a six month emergency fund? If not, work towards that first. 

Then, if you have a 401(k) with your employer, contribute enough to receive their max match.

If you don't have an IRA/Roth IRA, open one. You can use a broker such as Fidelity or Vanguard. You can contribute a max of $6000/year to this account. 

If your company offers a Health Savings Account (HSA), I would recommend signing up for it if it makes sense for you medically/financially. The thing about these account is that they're only available with a High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP). These types of plans have lower premiums, but higher deductibles than traditional health plans. This really isn't an issue if you have no preexisting health issues and only plan to see the doctor for an annual checkup. Also, you're allowed to contribute $3550/year to this account.

Once these ""retirement"" accounts are taken care of, you can turn your attention towards a brokerage account. OR, if you're able to afford it, try to max out your yearly 401k contributions (current max is $19.5k/year).

Although this seems very boring and you won't be able to touch this money until you're like 60, consistently putting money into retirement accounts will guarantee long term gains. Sure they might only be 10-15% (maybe) a year, but compound interest is a beast and over 20-30 years you can amass a substantial nest egg for retirement.

[This flowchart](https://i.imgur.com/u0ocDRI.png) more or less explains what I wrote. Keep in mind, you don't have to follow any of this, or can pick and choose what works for you. 

I would also research *three fun portfolios*. It's a pretty reliable, somewhat hands-off strategy. All of my retirement accounts are structured using this method to some extent.",404__LostAngeles,3,/r/stocks/comments/l8673o/never_bought_stocks_before_looking_for_advice_to/glcam77/,0.026,0.882,0.092,0.9773
1137,AT," The reason the ""sticking it to Wall Street"" narrative is successful is because the theory is that MOSTLY hedgefonds have to pay out. So it's good vs bad and the only one losing is the baddies because they shorted. 

I was really intrigued at the beginning but now I feel this party is over already but nobody wants to leave.. If you got in at the runup to 100, you already won big but people are expecting insane amounts.. I just don't see this happening AT ALL.

1198,GME," I'm not debating the short intrest. I'm debating the ""squeeze on Tuesday"".

The shorts can literally cover whenever they want, there's more than enough float.

You understand that a squeeze only happen if the shorts choose to cash out and there is no float available, therefore they have no choice but to go to whomever holds the share can then set the price. As long as there is a float there is no squeeze. 

Everyone acts like they found the stock market cheat code suddenly...that's not how it works. GME for sure was a squeeze, and hedges got caught...but everything else doesn't meet the criteria at all. Hedges aren't fucking dumb, they will adapt to market conditions quickly. Spreading the idea that retail can squeeze a stock at will and encouraging new/extremely dumb money to invest in pumped equity is dangerous and you're more than likely going to hurt a lot of new money when the bags start dropping.

1219,ACH," T+2 isn’t some law, it’s how banking works.  Day 1 is for the money to go from the first bank to the clearing house, day 2 is from the clearing house to the second bank.  The ACH process is how money is transferred in an inexpensive process.  Wire transfers are direct bank to bank and same day, but will cost upwards of $25/transfer - for each end.  ACH costs pennies.  So when these institutions are dealing with the volume of transactions that they do, there’s no way they’re going to pay for wires.  I run a receivables department for a Fortune 200 company, so I deal in customers paying both ways.

I would say that because of the ACH process, and the volatility of the transactions this past week, the statement seems completely plausible...",Leehouse65,11,/r/stocks/comments/l8kgse/can_someone_verify_if_this_statement_is_correct/gld39dk/,0.034,0.966,0.0,-0.5267
1220,GME," That statement is only half correct since it works on the sell-side also.  The brokerage technically doesn't immediately get the money from the clearinghouse when you sell your share but they front you the money immediately - when you are on margin.

During the deep crash in March/April,  there are a lot more selling $$ from many stocks (30+% of the whole market) combined vs. the run-up you see now in GME (10000% of a single small-cap stock).  The brokerage front a significantly more money back in March than they'll ever need to do now.

They made it all possible because there is an agreement between the clearinghouse and the brokerage that ""passes"" the collaterals from the user directly to the clearinghouse.  In the case of GME, limiting buying power of the user to ""cash only"" effectively protects both the brokerage and the clearinghouse since they are guaranteed to get paid for the shares by the user's cash.

If you put a ton of purchases on your credit card,  the bank may have a problem.  if you do the same on your debit card the bank is most likely won't care (ignore the fact the bank lends out more money than they hold in cash).",paq12x,1,/r/stocks/comments/l8kgse/can_someone_verify_if_this_statement_is_correct/gld6hy0/,0.05,0.864,0.086,0.7883

It would be foolish of the investor to not begin pricing this in, even as a rumor. The market does not wait to price until things are concrete, hence buy the rumor sell the news.

 At $15 share price, with Ryan Cohen entering a greater stake, potential evidence of a pivot to improved e-commerce and store presence and eliminating less profitable or overly dense locations, a strong argument can be made that the value is there to justify a higher price per share. This is the point that I made entry.

All this short squeeze, hype, blah blah, does not justify the current price. Enter the commodity thesis. Not the one I'm following but also not one I object to.

You get this wrong. GME is fucking with *some* hedgefonds. You will have a lot of wallstreet money that cashed in on long positions during the meteoric rise. Wallstreet will make tons of money with this either way.

It's a pump & dump with no squeeze before the dump is started. Shorts will make a fortune and big money will have optimized exits losing a lot less than retailers.

**What Likely Happened**: The risk department retard @ the clearing house, who does jack shit all year other than flag Stacy's trade so he can get some face time with her runs to the C-Suite frazzled; He has looked at option open interest expiring this week, has done the math and there simply isn't enough float for GME in anyway, shape or form; turns out WSB is printing out their stock certificates and burying them in the Mojave Desert. It's simply not enough.

In addition, they got a Snapchat from SEC/OCC which said hey, if you fucking keep selling open positions, you're on your own; we ain't gonna help you. SEC is sneaky like that; they like sending messages through the backdoor, not the front because they used to be hedgies themselves. If you're not following, Front door is making a public statement while the backdoor is a threat sent to an intermediary who you and millions of investors don't even know exists.

So, they call up the risk department at RH and tell em to stop fucking selling GME, there simply isn't enough float, the SEC told the clearing house they're on their own and who tf is gonna take the blame/liability if there's a ""failure to deliver""? 

---------------------------

2) **Failure to Deliver**:

This is a pretty fucking big deal. Bigger than you imagine, because it's basically a slam-dunk law suit. 

Failure to deliver means that one of the counterparties (in this case, the firm who sold you the option, RH or the clearing house) has failed to deliver you a contractually obligated position, profit or certificate. Since there's no float and ITM calls get exercised by HFT bots at the end of the day, how in the fucking hell are they gonna deliver the option holders their contractually obligated merchandise if there is no merchandise to be delivered? There simply isn't enough for everyone. Thousands (or possibly hundreds of thousands) of failures to deliver =  big risk


---------------------------

3) **Liability**: 

You must be asking so what? Fuck them; They should be the ones figuring it out and they gotta give me, the customer, the right to choose or whatever the fuck; That sounds great in a boomer fashion but it's not that simple. Robinhood is contractually obligated to deliver you those shares or positions. If they fail to, they become liable for any losses or profits that you may have endured and they will LOSE in court cause they FAILED to DELIVER. How many people have options on GME on RH? Half? Imagine if half of these fine RH customers were legally owed benefits and they were engaged in DDoS style lawsuits involving Robinhood or the clearing house. There would be no Robinhood left. There would likely be no clearing house left. Robinhood is also a shitshow of a company, so they likely didn't even have additional collateral to put up to the clearing house for normal share buying and selling on the meme tickers and since they bank with T-Mobile, they had to pull the plug.

Hence: Bad Decision > Bankruptcy or worse (WSB finds Vlad's mom and becomes her boyfriend collectively)


I personally don't believe it was out of malice or a coordination for RH; there's definitely coordination all around, but occam's razor says this is not such an ordeal.

1296,ALL," DTCC, the clearinghouse for WeBull, Robinhood and other brokerages, recently raised the collateral requirements for GameStop transactions to nearly 100%.

When RH takes a buy order it goes to it's clearinghouse to exchange it's clients money for shares. The shares are immediately and conveniently transferred to the client, but the funds aren’t transferred for 2 days. There's this gap between the broker and the clearinghouse for these unsettled trades that the clearinghouse will require some cash upfront (margin) for but otherwise accepts exposure for the rest.

If the stock being bought is extremely volatile, expensive and has a huge amount of recent volume and therefore unsettled trades, the clearinghouse will eventually realize they are floating quite a lot more to the broker than they are comfortable with on the back of a very risky equity. GME fits all these characteristics.
It's this point in the GME scenario where DTCC sets margin requirements to 100%. They tell their brokers, ""Hey if you want to get GME stock from us, we will not accept your word that this trade will settle in two days. Instead we need the money upfront since we are already way too exposed to this one ticker from you.""

Now, if Robinhood wants to continue filling buy orders for it's clients it needs to come up with ALL the money for each trade. RH does not have nearly enough cash on hand to handle this, hence the recent draw down from of Robinhood's credit lines as they try to get enough liquidity to keep buying shares for their clients.
Eventually the brokers just don't have enough cash, throw in the towel and stop accepting buy orders until they can settle more trades or the clearinghouses release the margin requirements for these stocks.

The concept that Robinhood would fuck over basically their entire user base on purpose to help a minority investor's minority investment in a hedge fund that already closed their fucking short position doesn't stand up to even the smallest amount of scrutiny.

1299,RH," Thanks for the good explanation.  I had read tidbits, but nothing this thorough.

I hadn't heard of Melvin investment in RH.
I had read Citadel paid RH something like 40% of their revenue.

It sounds like you think there wasn't anything sketchy (for lack of a better word) on Thursday.  I understand that brokers have to covered themselves.  It just seems suspicious.

Having most clearing houses (not just Apex and DTCC) ban buying on the same day makes me wonder.  Not to mention Thursday looked like a blatant short attack that couldn't be defended since many couldn't buy.  I'm sure the people most underwater exited their shorts then, which is disgusting.

Thoughts?

Also, why haven't most brokers, especially RH just outright said this?  That would at least help the situation.  There's lying and opacity all over.   I just don't get it.",CompulsionOSU,3,/r/stocks/comments/l8fiy3/regarding_stock_ticker_buying_limitations_can/glcgmez/,0.162,0.713,0.125,-0.8482
1300,GME," It’s not really suspicious when you consider that the volume index on GME was 600%. People that are not too familiar with the markets have to understand that this volatility is unprecedented. It literally happens probably ones in like 30 years.

What I want you to get out of this. You may think that hedge funds only hold short positions in GME. The answer is some do and some dont. Blackrock the largest hedge fund/money manager with over 2 trillion dollars AUM has a long position in GME. Blackrock is more powerful than any hedge fund, and has more political rep then many of them combined. There is no real reason why Balckrock would be happy with the price tanking so much.

Also, on the note of citadel. Citadel market maker and citadel hedge fund are too different things. Robinhood makes money from citadel market maker because the route their orders to them (options mostly if I understand correctly) and citadel pays them a fee for that.

Finance world is shady. But they are smart shady people, and they would not be caught in such a blatant situation especially considering many of them eat each other for breakfast. I recommend reading about the battle for Herbalife, where a hedge fund lost billions to another fund because they had different views on the company.",MichKOG,5,/r/stocks/comments/l8fiy3/regarding_stock_ticker_buying_limitations_can/glch1z1/,0.031,0.89,0.079,0.8756

In other words, this should shake the confidence of all those 401k holders as their investment is only as secure as the MMs want it to be.
