If crash is imminent, people holding GME won‚Äôt sell. Shorts will be forced to close out positions when margin calls start going out. Price will slowly go up while shorts begin to cover. FOMO wave will come in and buy shares. This will force the rest of the shorts to unwind their short positions. When everyone is strapped at home, in home entertainment will surge.

161,CLOV," I like the stock, but these squeeze plays are very unpredictable. A few of the factors affecting this stock.

1. Hindenburg short report. CLOV responded to the report, but the market has not responded favorably. It‚Äôs rather beat down.  Your opinion may vary on Hindenburg, mine is that they are a bit of a mixed bag, and not reliable. 

2. It ran last Thursday (4/08) on news that they are in 10 states doing direct contracting (seems to be a test model for 2021) through Medicare. This seems counterintuitive that they would be included in this new model if they are under DOJ investigation. Source: https://innovation.cms.gov/media/document/gpdc-model-participant-announcement

3.  Demetrios Kouzoukas is joining the board. According to the CEO, ‚ÄúHe has an encyclopedic knowledge of Medicare rules and regulations, combined with an incredibly astute business and strategy acumen.‚Äù  What is interesting to me is that he will serve on the Audit Committee.

4. ‚ÄúShort Interest‚Äù  This is difficult to calculate. I agree with OP that CEO‚Äôs shares should not be in the float, since they are locked up. You should know that smart shorts will hedge their bet with calls.  So I never bet on a short squeeze.

The big players are all vested in making CLOV successful, and the speculation that I've seen indicates a $19/share valuation by next year. **I already view CLOV as a company with strong growth potential, and I strongly believe it will be trading above $15 by Q1 2022.** The basis of my target is their expected customer growth and revenue increase. **This is regardless of a short squeeze, which will temporarily inflate the price of stock.**

CLOVer Health Investments is currently an ugly prospect thanks to recent bad press and a lawsuit. The company remains optimistic to double their customer base during the next year after hiring Kouzoukas (Do your DD. Personally, I believe this is likely in the current political climate). The mainstream media is trying really hard to connect Kouzoukas to Trump to make the company look worse. I view this as an obvious F.U.D. by the shorts and their pawns in the media.

230,PM," ‚ÄòRoaring Kitty‚Äô Boosts GameStop Bet After Exercising Options
Saturday, April 17, 2021 09:39 PM 
By Yueqi Yang

Keith Gill exercised 500 call options at strike price of $12
Gill‚Äôs Reddit post shows he now owns 200,000 GameStop shares
(Bloomberg) --The Reddit user who helped fuel the surge in GameStop Corp.‚Äôs stock price this year has doubled down on his bet by exercising his call options and buying even more shares.
Keith Gill, who goes by monikers ‚ÄúRoaring Kitty‚Äù and ‚ÄúDeepF___gValue,‚Äù posted a screenshot of his portfolio showing that he has exercised 500 GameStop call options expiring Friday at a strike price of $12, giving him 50,000 more shares. The stock closed at $154.69 on Friday.


Keith Gill speaks virtually during a House Financial Services Committee hearing on Feb. 18.
On top of that, Gill bought another 50,000 shares of the video-game retailer, effectively doubling his holdings to 200,000 shares from 100,000 at the beginning of the month. His total investment in GameStop is now worth more than $30 million, giving him a profit of nearly $20 million.

Gill‚Äôs mother, Elaine Gill, reached by phone at his childhood home in Massachusetts, confirmed the Reddit screenshots posted by her son.

Gill rose to fame this year as one of the most influential voices on Reddit and YouTube amid an effort by retail traders to squeeze GameStop short-sellers. He testified at a congressional hearing in February, where he said he didn‚Äôt call for anyone to buy or sell the shares for his profit.


Screenshot posted by Roaring Kitty on the r/wallstreetbets Reddit page.
The comments came as he was hit with a lawsuit that accused him of misrepresenting himself as an amateur investor. The suit alleges that he was actually a licensed securities professional who manipulated the market for profit, which he denied.

On Friday, GameStop Chief Executive Officer George Sherman, who is expected to leave, sold almost $12 million in shares. The company is looking for a new CEO as part of a shake-up spurred by activist investor and Chewy.com co-founder Ryan Cohen, a person with knowledge of the matter has said.

That 134% is based only on shares possible to be traded, which isn't wrong way of calculating it IMHO. In reality those 134% are like 30 something %, but again that's it if we include shares unable to be traded. 30 is a lot on it's own anyway.

Surprisingly too they have more older users than one would expect with only 64% of their users being less than 16 and a surprising 14% being 25 and over.

The product is definitely attracting the repetitive player-base needed to be a winner, if I were to guess there‚Äôs just either a management problem or they‚Äôre still in a huge growth period, the latter of which is fine and justifies their losses.

I'm usually a total war gamer and a mount&blade and football manager gamer. But Roblox has some really fun stuff. And yes it's also immensely popular with kids her entire school and all the kids at her programming class (one of her hobbies) are very much into it. When she turned 10 she was allowed to have a sleepover party with friends and they all slept in the living room. At one point around 4 AM my wife went downstairs because she heard something. They had turned my pc on, and my daughter's pc and where playing Roblox on it and then 3 other girls where also playing roblox on their phones.

419,DD," I'm not reading any of that, since a quick glance up at the end I see ""I won't go into fundamentals"" and I saw the word ""squeeze"", which tells me all I need to know about this DD.

&#x200B;

All you need to know about this company is this:

&#x200B;

* It's one of Chamath's many, many scammer endeavors
* There is a significant amount of short interest, which makes it a very volatile stock
* Volatile stocks based on this thesis are great for intraday scalps but are not investible.  Like, really great.  However, you will never see a significant gamma squeeze like you saw with Gamestop in early January, as most of the shorts are sitting in the $8-$9 range already, and thus aren't feeling any squeeze pressure.
* You should never hold this stock.  Ever.  If you want to trade it, put it on a watch list and if you see it starting to go parabolic, scale in for the ride up, and either use your ""Travelcenters of America"" (using that from now on cause the automod bans me when I use the acronym for technical analysis for quoting a sub billion company) skills to identify where the peak is (it's usually somewhere between 9 and 11 dollars) or else guess and hope for the best, then sell your calls right as the volume starts to dry up a little bit.  The trade should take no more than half an hour.
* Immediately go short and let it retrace at least 50% of the way back down.  If you're good with Travelcenters of America, you can probably let it retrace 80%.  If you were shadowing me yesterday, you saw me call a top at $10.02 (I was 1 cent off, sue me), told everybody to go into 5/21 9p's, and had them hold to $8.32 (so I was 4 cents off on the downside, double sue me).  Which means if you played my shadow right, you were in that trade for 2 hours, entered in your put at $1.30 and you exited at 1.70.  Intraday like that is the only worthwhile way to play this ""company"".
* If you ""just like the stock"", you might be the bad kind of retarded.

Retards and autists pls.

Also, most biotech/pharma stocks see massive movements on approval/breakthrough days. So, unless there is any potential catalyst, it's not likely that it will despite whatever your shitty 2012 4/20 memes indicate.

Also, your TA is way off. Price action shows that a reversal back down is more likely than a breakthrough.",ashu54,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/msrrzp/tech_will_break_its_420_resistance_on_420/guvfh7t/,0.0,0.927,0.073,0.498
