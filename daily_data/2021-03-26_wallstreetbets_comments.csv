**4:00 Update**

At end of the day, GME ended pretty much where it ended yesterday. All things considered, GME is still in a really strong position. Today was not a bad day for GME.

I don't really have any good explanation as to what happened today without sounding like a conspiracy theorist. There are obviously a lot of things about the stock market I don't understand. That's why I'm a smooth brained ape. I apologize that I let things get out of hand.

I will do better.

Current price: 180.00

**3:41 Update**

I realized nobody knows what I'm referencing. [2018 North Carolina's 9th congressional district election. ](liebertpub.com/doi/full/10.1089/eli.2019.0544). Absentee votes made no sense with the data we had available. They found out that the board was withholding certain absentee votes.

I really just want to understand the logic of how market orders works. Do they trade on the uptick or downtick? I've always assumed uptick but I have no idea. I've not been able to find anything that explains what the rules of that are. I want to better understand the rules of the game so I can play the game better.

I don't understand the rules that made today happen. I genuinely try to explain what the market is doing based on the data I see. Today is the first day where the data has made no sense to me. 

Current price: 177.91

**3:13 Update**

I want to be very clear. I'm not mad that GME went down. I'm not even mad that it's in the Red. I don't think that GME is in a bad position all things considered. I'm mad because there are some really strange patterns and coincidences going on that that I literally don't understand. None of the math makes sense to me anymore. I can't logically understand the narrative that explains what happened today unless it implies that the entire fucking economy is compromised.

The lack of transparency in the PUBLIC STOCK MARKET. How are we not able to double check the numbers to know that everything was valid? Why is everything so secret? 

I just want to know how many fucking shorts are in the market of the companies I'm looking to invest in. Why the fuck is that information impossible to find?

Current price: 173.03



**2:59 Update**

Russell 2000 is still matching GME. How. The entire fucking point of shit like the Russell is to take the composite of a large variety of stock so that it looks like a collection of all the stocks. Are you seriously telling me that all 2000 or however many stocks (I'm assuming that's what 2000 means) they have are trending the same way as Gamestop?

Y'all, I don't have an explanation as to what the fucks been going on. I'm literally too smooth brained to understand this. The only thing that comes to my mind would have implications so fucking crazy that I can't believe that they're true.

Current price: 172.88

**2:38 Update**

Seriously, can I get 538 or someone to do a statical analysis on the trades today? I literally don't understand how the velocity can change so sudden and be so consistent on literally the same level of volume. Was there some massive news that I miss? Is there mechanic of the stock market that I don't understand? Someone please help me.

Didn't we figure out that there was voting fraud because statical analysis of the votes showed that that possibility was so fucking insane that something was up?

Current price: 169.50

**2:30 Update**

How the fuck does this logically work?!?

From opening bell to 10:44 (74 minutes), GME traded 15,957240 shares. GME went up by 18.60 or up 9% from where GME started today. 

From that point on until 2:02 (191 minutes), GME traded another aprox. 15,957,240 shares. GME dropped $46.15 or down 22.4% from the price at 10:44.

I'm literally too smooth brained to understand this. Can anyone give me an explanation?

Current price: 169.50

**2:00 Update**

Let's talk volume. By the time this fall started (10:44), the volume was at 15,967,240. I'm keeping that for myself in case I need it for a future post.

Current price: 166.63

**1:47 Update**

I really refuse to believe that GME is such a big aspect of the Russell 2000 that it would copy GMEs trajectory. Either this is a coincidence, or they're manipulating the Russell 2000 to bring GME down.

I really can't comprehend that the HFs have so much unchecked power that they can move something like the Russell 2000. This has to be a crazy conspiracy theory, right?

I can't think of where else they're getting these shorts.

Any ideas anyone?

Current price: 171.29

**1:30 Update**

I feel like the Russell 2000 and GME are moving in the same direction for the most part. That feels interesting, though I don't have enough data to see if there's an actual correlation. If they're shorting the Russell 2000, that would explain where they're getting their shorts from.

I wish I could see the other ETFs and see how those numbers stack up with what's happened today.

Current price: 181.53

**1:23 Update**

So busy talking about my dog that I missed that GME went into the Red. There's still no volume though, so I expect that number to change if volume picks up. It seems a lot of people are waiting to see if GME will go any lower before they buy in today. I'm suspecting we'll have an interesting power hour.

Volume: 29,000,000

Shorts available: 10,000

Current price: 181.70

**1:17 Update**

As we wait for something interesting to happen, let me introduce you all to my good boy. [This is Banjo Mooseheart.](http://imgur.com/gallery/MlDhAOn) He is a Shepherd mix and lives a very hard life. He has many adventures and I plan to write a collection of those adventures in The Tales of Banjo Mooseheart. He loves peanut butter and running around the house. He's kept me sane over many stressful nights.

He's a good boy.

Current price: 183.29


**12:57 Update**

How much have volume slowed?

One hour into the day, we were at around 15,000,000 volume. Two hours and 15 minutes later, GME only got an extra 12,000,000 volume. This is a big reason that GME essentially stalled. This HFs were able to attack the stock during the low volume to destroy GME's momentum and bring it down, however they stopped their attack when they couldn't break into the Red. Because volume hasn't kicked back up, GME stalled where it's at now (around 190).

If HFs are out of ammo, and volume doesn't pick up, this is where GME will end up at the end of the day.

Again, GME has had a pretty traumatic week. If it ends up in the green, it'll go into next week with a ton of momentum. Calls ITM outweigh Puts so there should be that bump next week.

Next week's option chain is a monthly (not a weekly) so the stakes will probably be larger.

Also, HFs still need to close their shorts.

It wasn't the day many were hoping for, but I would still consider it a success for GME investors.

I still feel that 200 is reasonable.

Volume: 27,900,000

Shorts available: 7,000

Current price: 190.49


**12:29 Update**

Yes, yes. Shorts. I finally have some time to look at data. Forgive me for not reporting earlier.

A lot of shorts have been fired. Upward to 191,000 actual shorts and God knows how many synthetic shorts have been fired since this morning. Even with all of that though, GME is still in the green.

That's so fucking huge. As their ammunition runs low (is that even possible?) GME's upward trend should continue. Finishing above 200 seems quite reasonable.

GME seems to have stalled close to yesterday's close. It seems that the HFs were able to stop the upward momentum, though they haven't been able to keep GME in the Red. Volume is still relatively low compared to this morning. 

Lunch hasn't really picked up. Moonshot is probably out of the realm of possibilities for today. Don't you dare assume that I'm saying the final squeeze is dead. I'm just saying that it probably won't happen today. It was a long shot anyways.

Even if GME stays here for the rest of the day though, it would be a huge statement for GME's resiliency after everything it's endured this week.

Volume: 26,400,000

Current price: 189.23

**11:54 Update**

GME rebound. It seems to have momentum, which should keep up if volume picks up again.

Current price: 190.43

**11:29 Update**

Holy fuck.

The onslaught continues. $30 in 50 minutes. However, the volume still doesn't match the first hour. We'll see if volume increases at lunch.

Volume: 22,000,000

Current price: 179.45

**11:04 Update**

GME keeps dropping, but volume hasn't kicked back up. Revised adjusted napkin math makes my estimate total volume at 67,925,000 which means that the volume in the past 30 minutes has been MUCH less than at opening bell. You can't legitimize a stocks price with that kind of volume. That's why the price goes up when the volume is up. The sample size at higher volume is more representative of the market' actual perception of a stocks value.

Please just close your shorts. I really don't think you're going to convince enough people with these scare tactics.

Volume: 19,800,000

Current price: 196.25

**10:52 Update**

Holy fuck. Did y'all see that? That strike took GME down nearly $10 in like 5 second. What a fucking missile.

Current price: 198.48

I’ve missed the initial boost on almost every one of their SA picks because I didn’t really check my email that often. 

That said, I still have made a fuck ton from their picks that I would have never heard of. TPIC for like $14 (now at $50 but I don’t think they recommend it still) and BILI at $20 (they don’t recommend this one either anymore but I sold it at ~$135). 

Both of those had a little boost when they were recommended and then slumped and stagnated until last year. Not sure when they stopped recommending them or said to sell but they both made me a ton of money. Their other picks are good too but like you said they aren’t FDs or gonna make a bunch in a month or two.

There is no connection to GME. The connection is that hedge fund shorties having been manipulating the market, and if they fall it will temporarily make a lot of people uncomfortable. GOOD, this shit needs to stop. Borrowing shares without true owners knowledge, market manipulation, and illegal check kiting does not work in Vegas, and it should not work on Wall Street.

But truth is Ferrari essentially had to pick their top 499 customers to buy the LaF, and there were more than 499 people who wanted one

Same thing is happening right now with Porsche and the 992 911 gt3. There are more customers than there are build slots so they have to choose. And since these are at the end of the day premium luxury items, i don't blame these companies for being selective

And its not just Ferrari and Porsche who do this. Ford did it with the Ford GT. Pagani and Koenigsegg are pretty selective or will put you on a many year waitlist.

306,IMO," Normally they would want us in anything so they can run it against us. Twelve years ago when I started trading, I was watching Crammer and he mentioned about ten stocks to hold. I made notes of all of them and they all were down the very next day 20 to 50 dollars. Every single one of them. there wasn't one stock that was green. Now those are some great holds huh?

Bad new is always IMO time to buy and buy as much as possible.  So I'm no paper hands bitch.  I have held through both spikes and will continue holding. Especially when they seem so desperate to protect the retail investors by telling us to stay away from a stock that we like. Not financial advice is only from my experience just my personal option. So if you need financial advice seek a professional. Just keep in the back of your mind how good news in media is really BAD news and when bad news hits the media its usually really good news.

One other note to be considered, why are the all of a sudden so ready to help the retail trader with advice. No one was there to rescue me when I was down over 100k in a single trade. ;)

&#x200B;

EDIT: Also at the opening bell we will often times see huge amounts of green within the first 10 to 20 minutes (headfake) to convince buyers to buy before they start selling or create a sell off (headfake) by dropping price for 10 to 20 minutes when they want to convince traders to sell. Thus creating buyers or selling so they can do the opposite. If they want to buy they first create sellers. So if they want to cover what would they do? They need sellers to buy back and would love for the price levels to be much cheaper even profitable for them to get out or at least somewhere around breakeven.",daytraderarchitects,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mdfycw/great_day_today_apes/gsanu3a/,0.063,0.796,0.142,0.9684

368,EAF," You are so close to a realization. Yes, pollution crackdowns will hurt the steel industry, which is exactly why Nucor is in a position to capitalize since they are one of the few steel companies that do not use any blast furnaces and actually have a green plan that is way ahead of the manufacturing industry. You literally acknowledge this yourself, but stop one step short. Nucor is investing in renewable energy and even equipping plants with solar energy sources and the EAF operation is already well below environmental requirements.

&#x200B;

And where do you get this turnover rate stat. Citation seriously needed. I've never heard of a manufacturing company that spends so much capital staying well ahead of safe work standards. Everything I'm googling shows they have one of the best retention rates in that business.

As Leon and Fortress do thy hide their identities behind other instruments, e.g. Fortress reorganized Dynex Capital DX 2000-03 behind CMO Capstead Mortgage, Fortress sold 70% interest in Nationstar for $3.8B to Mr. Cooper COOP which is a big position of Leon Cooperman (Fortress/SoftBank is the biggest shareholder in $COOP but they do not show on any journal, maybe position in another street name next to KKR 17% COOP position), OCN, OMF, NRZ Leon Cooperman holds most of them right alongside Fortress. EJF Capital holds 10M NOVC, MassMutual 19.3M, Fortress holds 22M of NOVC. Fortress is Taberna I and II, EJF is Kodiak CDO CDOs that hold all of NOVC only Sr Debt to leave Ch 11 with $6.3M cash & no cram down. NOVC Chairman Barry Igdaloff made a fortune over 20 yr Board Membership at Dynex Capital $DX thanks to Wesley Edens and Fortress ownership of CMO Capstead Mgt. 

Fortress should be expected to do what they have done before and Leon Cooperman will probably be right there like COOP, OCN, etc. I expect they will separate NOVC own Novastar Financial as tax exempt MREIT just like Fortress did at $DS which separated $NRZ, $SNR, $GCI (one of Leon Cooperman positions). $NRZ 2020 10K shows Fortress cashed $170M Mgt Fee and $20M NRZ dividends in one yr alone 2019.

The police officers first shot didn’t kill it and it was trashing around wildly as the fire crew tried to get hold of it and hold it down for the second shot. Blood flying everywhere on them.

551,GME," The company's reporting was full of CYA legalese, which is to be expected, given the circumstances. I'm not concerned about the statement.

In fact, the statement is about volatile price movements and whether they reflect the company's current or future valuation. Here, GameStop's executives make the case that such volatility is not representative of either. I agree.

This is a company that was heading straight down, well into last year, and it now seems to be turning straight into a new direction. Reasonably linear trajectories of the share price would better reflect the company's valuation. 

What this statement does not speak to is the executives' view on the current share price's positioning vis-a-vis current or prospective performance. This is a question you are asking, and, however valid, it is not addressed in the quoted statement or elsewhere in the official release (if memory serves me correctly). 

I can hardly imagine a company - even headed by the most masochistic of CEOs - reporting cynically about its current or future valuation.

The answer to your question is more nuanced, of course, because you're asking whether the current share price reflects current or prospective company performance. Well, who decides that? Me? You? The market?

When it comes to me and you, I'm sure you can answer for yourself. As for me, like most, I'm making decisions based on myriad influences, ranging from personal due diligence, bias, impulsivity, mania, a magic 8-ball, whatever.

Seriously, I know I'll get downvoted because ApE GaNg or whatever, but putting your literal life savings into an ultra-volatile stock is not wise. It could work out, or it could ruin your life.

People who are actively encouraging this behavior are being selfish. They want other people risking their money so that they themselves make money. But, this is not a game. Your life savings can evaporate in a day on a stock like GME. 

The hard truth is that the GME ""movement"" claims to be about fighting the hedge funds for the working man, or whatever, but if you're encouraging the working man to risk everything they have on a stock, you're a hypocrite. The initial GME rally to 500 and crash back down to 50 hurt regular folks a lot more than it hurt the 1%. *A lot* more. 

You wanna throw some fuck-around money into a volatile stock? Hell ya brother, that's what this place is all about. I do it every week. But don't put your livelihood on the line for fucking gamestop.

One of them was Gabe Plotkin, founder and chief investment officer of Melvin Capital, a hedge fund that required billions in additional cash after incurring major losses due to a short squeeze of GameStop stock by groups of retail investors.

901,GME," I don’t think people realize what kind of whale retail actually is. I remember hearing that half of all robinhood users have GameStop stock back in January. They have 23 million users, so 11.5m. Average account size of 5k. And since I’m sure not everyone is balls deep with all of their portfolio in just GME, we’ll cut that down to $1500. 

**That would be 17.25 billion dollars, or roughly 90 million shares at current market value.** That’s not accounting for any other platforms. This is why I disagree with the narrative that retail is simply riding the coat tails of whales. I think retail is the whale, and a much larger one than anyone realizes.

Edit: corrected numbers, adding this snippet from CNBC article Incase link not allowed

“JMP Securities analyst Devin Ryan estimates Robinhood's total accounts are now closer to 23 million, including the 3 million gained in January and 10 million users added in 2020 as investing from home boomed during the pandemic.

Robinhood's Tenev told Congress last week the company had delivered more than $35 billion in realized gains to investors, which implies big growth in customers and customer assets.

You have to think about the compounding effect. This would “natural” make the stock price go up. The higher the “natural” price per share the higher the squeeze and the higher the loss for the HFs. At some point, I hope....unless they want to go the Bear Stearns route and not accept the truth, they would start buying all the shares to cover and force the squeeze.

Considering that many of the early folks have 1000+ shares, I think 20 shares is very conservative. I’m of the belief that retail owns between 75%-100%+ of the float, and shorts are fuk.

935,USA," The USA will be significantly less impacted by this than much of the rest of the world. Little of America’s trade relies on the Suez by comparison to nations nearer to it.

Most US trade either comes from China across the Pacific, from Mexico by road, from South America via the Atlantic or Pacific, and from Europe across the Atlantic. The only US trade that comes through the Suez Canal is Middle Eastern oil, and much of America’s oil now comes from either domestic sources or Canada.

This means we’ll see momentary bumps in US-based companies, who will still be able to conduct business at regular speed, and momentary dips in European ones who can’t because of the blockage.",Atheist-Paladin,10,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mdnfyc/suez_canal_blockage/gsalc7y/,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

941,UK," Once ships start to route around Africa, expect oil and diesel prices to go up. It's not just the impact to supply and delays to get oil to refineries, it is also an increase in consumption of diesel and fuel oil by those ships routing around Africa. 

A trip from Shanghai to the UK via the Suez is about 11800 miles, the same trip going around the entire continent of Africa is almost 17,000 miles. That extra mileage adds about 11 days and a shit ton of fuel. The newer and most fuel efficient  Suezmax ships burn 60 tons of fuel per day at slow steaming. Older ships coupled with the need to steam faster will likely burn closer to 110 tons of fuel per day.  The cost of shipping will obviously go up dramatically due to the cost of fuel, staffing and time. But the cost of fuel itself will also likely go up. Figure Diesel is roughly 750 barrels per ton. So, each ship will burn an extra 8,200 barrels per trip and if 300 ships take the long way around, that's an increase consumption of 2,460,000 barrels. I will admit this is very rough numbers and doesn't take into account that those ships would burn that fuel either way - but you do have to consider it is an increase in fuel burned for the same amount of cargo. 

The biggest question is whether the price of oil and distillates will go up because of this increased demand or will that cost be absorbed into the increase in shipping costs. And, how much can the shipping companies increase profits while passing on their increased costs to their customers.",emsbronco,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mdnfyc/suez_canal_blockage/gsbs7zj/,0.014,0.899,0.087,0.9613

1016,GME," That's enough to buy 100+ shares of something. You only need 100 shares to sell a call. The deeper OTM you sell it the less you make.... But the more times you could likely sell it making sustained income. Go deep as fuck to start. Until you get a feel for how the stock trends and then maybe drag it closer to ITM to maximize premium and still have low risk of assignments. Think of it as supplemental income to start. Once you have a bigger starting investment of say like 40 or 50k then it could be a decent yearly income. 

The trick is to make a decent bit while still holding the stock needed to make someone whole in case they decide to exercise and you get assigned. You don't necessarily want to get assigned per se... But the deeper OTM your call the more you'll make if you get assigned. The closer to ITM the more premium you make.

 So say I bought 1000 shares of XYZ at 5$ a share. That means I can sell 10 calls. If I sell weeklies and sell them OTM at 15$ strike price  and make say .25$ in premium per share I make 25$ per option sold. A total of 250$ per week for all 10 contracts just in premium. That's all yours. No one gets to take that. Not to mention if I get assigned on all 10 of those contracts they have to buy those shares from me at 15$ a share. So in this case I've turned 5k$ into 15.25k$.  But maybe I could sell those same contracts for an entire year if I'm lucky before I get assigned on them. Obviously the price will go up and down in premium because of volatility and relationship to the strike price and current price but leat say on average I can sell the contracts at 180$ a week and not get assigned until that last week... That means that I sold 10 contracts 52 times for 180$ per week. 52 x 180$= 9360$ in that year in options contract premiums. Plus getting assigned at the end for 15k. I turned a 5k investment into 24,360$ minus taxes.

Now it's important that if you're going to sell a call that you do it with stock to back that call up... Otherwise if you get assigned you gotta buy at the price the stock is currently trading for and they get to buy at the strike. So say I sell a naked call... Idk why I would be that retarded... But let's just say I am. I sell the call while the stock price is at 12$ at a 36$ strike and only 1$ premium... And let's say this stock is GME... And then someone exercises the call at 200$.... Welp... My dumb ass having no shares has to buy that shit... At 200$ per share times 100 shares. Now. I'm.. fucked... 20k-3.6k=16.4k... then you have 100$ premium you made to offset your loss by 100$ for a grand total of 16.3k loss per call...big oof

TLDR:

If you're gonna sell calls have stock to back it up. Or you're fucked if you get assigned. Just don't fuck around with naked calls man... Might as well set fire to everything you own at that point. 

If you're gonna sell puts make sure you're okay with buying the stocks sold at the strike price you set and have the money to buy them... Or you're fucked. Otherwise buy calls and buy puts. The most you can lose is your premium.

1017,GME," I want to stress that I am NOT a trader, I am buy and hold who generates some extra income on the side from select situations. If I look right now in my portfolio for example I own 100 shares of Splunk. I am up 180% as I’ve had them for a few years, come down quite a bit off the highs, I don’t feel like selling and paying capital gains and just kind of like them long term, I know competitors are lining up. next earnings release isn’t until June so I don’t think anything is gonna happen to make the price suddenly jump. Stock is it $133 I could sell 1 call, say the May $145, collect $450. If the stock goes up 10% in the next seven weeks and it gets called so be it, i’m happy I sold for $1200 more than it is today plus I have the extra $450. If it’s any price under 145 on that date the $450 was free money. But again, I’m not a trader, buying for $4800 and selling for $14,500 a few years later is the money, the extra $450 is just a low effort way of making a tiny bit more.

Honestly anything I do with options, from hedging to rolling the dice on the next GME, pales in comparison to The simple fact that I’ve been maxing out my annual 401(k) contributions for 25 years.

On the long run, more witcher on netflix could bring more attention to the game itself, and cyberpunk patches will come and make it the game it was supposed to be.

I'd like to get your opinion:

Wouldn't the days to cover ratio or short interest ratio (whatever you want to call it) prove that XL is likely a highly shorted stock?

1161,DD," This stock has been banging the liquidation price floor often recently, so currently traders are assigning no or negative premium to its ""overhead"", which is mainly management and growth prospects. Considering the options route, it's difficult to predict when this sentiment ends.  Also, the Russell inclusion plan fell flat, and it'll be in June earliest, if it happens. As such, I wouldn't expect any fast-acting catalysts soon. Considering stocks, you just missed the ex-dividend date, but if you do your DD and conclude that it's a safe bet, then I would agree - this seems to have very little or no downside but a lot of upwards potential. Usually it's considered a ""buy"" signal if the price is so low that very few of its current owners are ""in the money"" (and the company itself is solid), and this is what's happening right now.

Actually, I believe shorting this stock intraday would be a good play, if you had enough capital for this.

1169,PLTR," The voting power really does matter...

Might be confusing this with another company I'm looking at, so someone fact check this, but aren't they structured in such a way that Thiel and Karp together have majority voting power, regardless of share ownership.

So as long as Thiel and Karp agree he can stay there's no outside pressure on him from shareholders. If they're cool with the long term strategy, then he's safe regardless of price targets. I believe in the leadership and I'm a hopeful investor. I can be wrong.

If you don't like it, don't buy, but if you're advocating for others not to buy, make sure what you're saying is fact based and not generalizations that may be accurate for other situations, but doesn't apply to this case.

Edit:

To address the selling tech part, their existing contracts are growing, they have amazing retention, and they're adding clients. Their clients then have Palantir platforms ingrained in their processes and then PLTR has a client for life. As these people move companies, they bring up ""at my last job we used *insert PLTR platform*"". There's already been a lot of expansion throughout different government agencies as people move around, and I'm confident the same will happen in the corporate world since their platforms provide true value. I see it as all substance, no flash.

This isn't about selling, this is a network effect that has the potential to ingrain itself in nearly all businesses since the problems they address are domain-agnostic.

Anyone can make a word processor, but imagine trying to steal business from Microsoft Word today. It's possible, but you'd have a mountain to climb

I see a similar thing happening with PLTR for data driven decision making platforms.

The differences from Word are that there are no serious competitors in the space yet (so you don't need to out market) and not everyone realizes the value brought by the platform (potentially a reason to market) however, marketing that aspect will draw attention to potential competitors. In my mind, it's best to be the only one in the space and grow out your ingrained user base early, rather than hype train and be inundated with noise from competitors",jrodbtllr138,5,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mdrmb7/palantir_ceo_lawyers_tell_me_my_job_is_to_evade/gsb7n2i/,0.07,0.814,0.116,0.971

1238,GME," I am not sure why you're saying ""there's no fuckery here"" when otc IS the dark pool even if done through an ATS...according to the government...Just because something is NON ATS doesn't mean that an OTC transaction is more legit; it's just about as secret as an ats transaction.

**dark pool is just a term for OTC exchanges (ATS, alternative trading systems or something), there can be unlisted HFT exchanges done OUTSIDE dark pools**


the half billion trade frequency of GME was done non-ats!

https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/investing-basics/glossary/alternative-trading-systems-atss

Furthermore, let's look at the sauce for the OTC report for, say, september 2020.

https://otctransparency.finra.org/otctransparency/OtcIssueData

What you see is 110 million shares traded and only 272,000 total trades.

So the high frequency trading has changed by several orders of magnitude done outside ATS in OTC trades.

1243,GME," Let me start with your first point that ""OTC IS the dark pool"". I read the site you posted and I feel I may have been slightly misleading so I will reword things, but my point remains the same. OTC refers to any trade made off the exchange while ATS is specifically between 2 investors directly. This is why FINRA makes this distinction. OTC non-ATS is brokerage and market maker trading, ATS is investor to investor trading. 

If people need I can give examples of what would be considered ATS and what would be OTC-non ATS. Just don't feel that's relevant here.

Next I honestly cannot comprehend how you calculated total traded volume for GME in September. What I did is I went to [yahoo finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/history?p=GME) and downloaded a spreadsheet of the historical data of GME for the past year. I then used excel to quickly sum together all of the volumes for the September trading days (should be cells G113-G133). I found 254,864,200 total shares traded. No clue where you got 272,000. What that means? 110M traded OTC, 255M traded total. \~50% traded OTC just as every other stock and data point I provided. You just added more proof to my pudding that this is a normal thing.

I chose my stocks as close to at random as I could, but give me another NYSE stock you consider to be less ""voluminously traded"" and I'll gladly add it to the data supporting my case.

My conclusion stands, as I just demonstrated there has been NO shift in OTC market behavior relative to total volume. Furthermore, I continue to say, I am NOT trying to say there is no manipulation, or even that it is impossible that Citadel's market making division isn't purposely selling GME for less than they bought it to lower the price for a loss in hopes of saving other divisions. I believe the stock is manipulated and I have hope for the squeeze, especially with todays price action. What I am saying is that the sheer existence of these OTC trades means NOTHING.

Not necessarily always true. come on.

>I honestly cannot comprehend how you calculated total traded volume for GME in September

I was talking about the submitted otc non-ats issuance for gme in september; just sort it by monthly and go to that months reporting then bring up gme.

>I chose my stocks as close to at random as I could

Are you sure? because most of them are the highest frequency trades for Jan if you sort by volume of trades, not shares.

masks how high the HFT is by suggesting it's normy.

Except the trade frequency is insanely high",rub_a_dub-dub,7,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/md9psv/on_the_dark_poolotc_trading_claims_amcgme/gs8z5ty/,0.052,0.91,0.038,-0.2151

I'ma jump on a soapbox here. All you new WSB'ers need to understand that there is a HUGE difference between an autist and a retard.
