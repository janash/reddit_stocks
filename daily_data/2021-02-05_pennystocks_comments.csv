So RIGL is therapeutics, and Moderna & Pfizer are Vaccines, read very bottom of each paragraphs.

RIGL is to treat existing case of infection

Moderna & Pfizer is to prevent healthy people from getting COVID-19 in the future. However, cannot use this to treat a patient who is already sick.

## How do antibody therapeutics work?

To make an antibody therapeutic, we can take blood from a person who has already survived COVID-19, extract the antibody-producing B cells, and use genetic sequencing technology to make antibodies. If we can identify the antibody that neutralizes SARS-CoV2 in a test tube, then we can produce massive quantities of that antibody to use as a drug. The antibody is injected into a patient experiencing COVID-19, helping them fight off the infection. These therapeutics are designed to treat existing cases of infection.

## How does a vaccine work?

A vaccine, however, is what we call “active immunity.” A vaccine can be a piece of a virus, an inactivated virus, or a live virus that no longer has the ability to cause disease. When we inject this into a human being, the immune system launches an attack as if the person were actually experiencing a genuine SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, though, the person will not get sick, and that attack will give the inoculated person what we call “immune memory.” Immune memory protects them from future infection because the body has already learned how to respond to the virus, allowing your body to clear SARS-CoV-2 before it can do any damage. In many cases, this protective immunity can last years to an entire lifetime. Vaccines are perfectly safe and can prevent healthy people from getting COVID-19 in the future. However, we cannot use this to treat a patient who is already sick.",dohtem213,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/ld1t8i/amazing_how_nobody_talks_about_this_stock_when/gm5noid/,0.065,0.796,0.139,0.9817

In many cases, this protective immunity can last years to an entire lifetime. Vaccines are perfectly safe and can prevent healthy people from getting COVID-19 in the future. However, we cannot use this to treat a patient who is already sick.",dohtem213,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/ld1t8i/amazing_how_nobody_talks_about_this_stock_when/gm5noid/,0.065,0.796,0.139,0.9817

In the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the Company’s revenue from continuing operations is expected to be between $25.5 million and $25.8 million and between $100.9 million and $101.6 million, respectively. Revenue for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2020 was negatively impacted by COVID-19 shelter-in-place policies and restrictions on elective surgical procedures around the world, which began in most geographies in March 2020 and continued to varying degrees throughout 2020 and presently. The Company expects its operating loss to be between $106.1 million and $116.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2020 and between $185 million and $196 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, inclusive of approximately $92.4 million of non-recurring charges related to its acquisition of Holo Surgical. As of December 31, 2020, the Company’s cash balance is expected to be approximately $44 million.

The recall by the Company’s former OEM businesses of their Cervalign ACP System, which occurred in January 2021, is expected to result in a lost revenue opportunity for the year ending December 31, 2021. In the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company generated $2.5 million of revenue from the sale of the Cervalign ACP System. The Company is working with its former OEM businesses to address the issue that resulted in the recall through product design alterations, although there can be no assurance as to if or when such efforts will be successful. At December 31, 2020, the Company held approximately $1.9 million of Cervalign ACP System inventory, which will be written off in the fourth quarter of 2020.

158,CNS," The site explains their rationale and is a good read.

https://www.tonixpharma.com/pipeline/tnx-102-sl-for-fibromyalgia

So nCBP (norcyclobenzaprine) is a long lived metabolite that is reduced in production  due to the sublingual formulation. This metabolite is a CNS (central nervous system) activator which is linked to insomnia, tachycardia, sweating, and palpitations.  By avoiding that metabolite production they believe that the drug is safe for long term use. Another thing is that the drug is focused on sleep related fibromyalgia exacerbation and on PTSD. So as above, CNS activity increase can negatively effect sleep quality. Cyclobenzaprine, however, is an antagonist for histamine-1, serotonin-2a, and alpha-1adrenergic receptors which are associated with different sleep mechanisms respectively.

So I think really it is interesting as it is not only treating fibromyalgia by addressing sleep exacerbation but also is agreed by the FDA for PTSD. Though I couldn't see anything overt on the website I think there is also possibility for off-label use with other sleep disorders.",PenguinNinjaCat,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/lcueci/dd_for_tnxp_looks_great_to_me_tell_me_what_you/gm3tas3/,0.032,0.883,0.085,0.7566

162,TNXP," When a company pulls a reverse split, it's usually due to low share prices.  Its usually a signal that a company isn't doing well.

From my own experience with TNXP, I held about 200 shares for about a month.  The price didn't move, but people were slowly buying.  Then the price busted out over a dollar over 2 days of trading.  Almost immediately, TNXP took an offer, reducing the price to .90 again.  They needed money so bad, they took the first pile of cash they could get.  Now sometimes, that's a sign of growth, which is good.  But with TNXP, I believe it may be something else.  Idk I'm not a professional.

> buy now before it TAKESOFF? 

>In all seriousness I don't know much about investing or business. What I do know is tech. The drone industry is still seriously under developed. There is massive untapped potential. The way drones are used now is extremely short-sighted. It's like when cellphones became something everyone could own, but people were only using them to make phone calls. No. It's a handheld computer, camera, microphone, alarm clock, etc. (you get the idea) 

>The potential of the drone industry is to automate the sky. Anything that flies, or that needs flying to be done right now, can be done by drones. Package delivery, yes. Human delivery (air taxi), yes. Unloading/loading shipping containers. Autonomous inspections and maintenance of wind turbines, cell towers, powerlines, oil and gas pipelines, large fuel/storage tanks. 3d printing entire buildings using drones as the printer head. The sky is the limit. 

>And DDC is a serious company. They are the only government certified company that has permission to fly autonomous beyond line of sight missions. And they're the only ones already doing it. Shares at $2 is nothing when it will be at $200+ in a few years.

They use many different proteins that the immune system detects which allow the vaccine to be sensitive to different mutations. You can read about it in the study report as well.   
They also have deals about delivering Brazil.   


Also I think that the US will more likely allow an US-Indian Co-production than using the Russian vaccine Sputnik V in their country as well. Germany is thinking about it after an international study report in the Lancet that states the efficacy.

454,DD," Definitely far from an expert over here, but I started out investing $100 a year ago and between several flips and a few good investments it's turned into about $3600. 

My advice? Find some stocks in the $0.00× range to start off with. Do your DD to choose wisely, then invest about $10 each into them. Each time you double your profit, secure your profit and reinvest on the next dip. Once you're up to about $200 or $300 find a decent stock in the $0.0×-$0.x range and then put a fair amount into that. Essentially climbing the ladder. (:

Considering the poor research results, I think it is unlikely that Frostamatinib will replace thrombopoietin mimetics, Rituximab, or splenectomies, and I have doubts about its success with COVID-19 patients as well. At 18%, Frostamatinib has the lowest stable response rate of any first-line or second-line treatment. Compare this against steroid use, where dexamethasone and predisone have response rates of 79% and 59%, or Rituximab, which demonstrates an initial response rate of 62%. Second-line treatments, such as Eltrombopag, have 80% response rates. Frostamatinib also has a large side-effect profile.

607,CRNT," I haven’t done much DD on CRNT. Currently based off of graphical data and other analysis it looks like it’s going to stay steady between $5.00 - $5.91 for a little while. For next week I’d say you can catch it around $5.20 and have an exit point around $5.60.

619,DD," I am definitely in long term. They have a sound conservative business model that I believe has a great chance of succeeding in its own. 

The real kicker that nobody talks about with this stock is that it should always trade above normal valuations and be a meme stock that is talked about. The investors in the league will be extremely dedicated fans and will always be buzzing about it with others who will watch and invest as well (who doesn’t want to own part of a football league).  It will have demand for the stock because its football and it will have a dedicated base of fans larger than a normal league could expect because it can be invested in by normal people. 

There is a ton of DD available posted by myself and others about the leadership and ties to the NFL as a developmental league.
