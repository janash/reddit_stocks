0,EOD," I will admit that chart looks fine as hell. 

However, be careful with ARK investments. They themselves drive stock prices up. Meaning, when they sell off half the shares, that shit will tank before you can pick your phone up. 

I need to trademark ""ARK-effect^^TM"". Simply having Cathy and select your stock for her ETF/investments unnaturally pumps your stock, and inevitably, Cathy selling tanks your shit by 70% EOD. 

(The TM means trademarked, fuck off.)

Who am I kidding. Throwing $500 at it tomorrow. Thanks, OP.",MyThrowawayThyme,55,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/osax1h/penny_stock_under_2/h6nm03i/,0.153,0.73,0.117,-0.8225

2,RSI," Looking at it now, I like the future potential longterm but I hate the chart with a passion. Near resistance, MACD, RSI etc all showing overbought. For a stock to go from $20 to where it is now it shows bad management and they probably don't care much for investors and are traded simply to raise money. (Like most penny stocks, it's a toxic cycle) BUT, cathy bought even at 1.40s... this tells me she knows something we don't, or is simply buying to have exposure while being fine with taking a loss on it. If this is a winner, it's one of the few rare stocks that recover from a chart like that. I'm not sure if they JUST pivoted into joints/hips replacements  or what, but if cathy wasn't buying it'd be a big pass for me. I'll take a look at the fundamentals tomorrow because I'm intrigued as to why she's buying into resistance on this kind of chart, I'm amazed that she is.",ZenLeTomson,14,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/osax1h/penny_stock_under_2/h6nxw2i/,0.101,0.787,0.112,0.2651
3,CFMS," Glad I read this, I used to trade CFMS stock a bit in the past and they seemed like a great company, it just never seemed to run in correlation with how good they seemed to me.  Nice to see ARK loading, just wish they were closer to that dollar mark since ARK generally has a 5 yr plan when loading.",SnooCalculations9259,2,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/osax1h/penny_stock_under_2/h6nlr8h/,0.0,0.731,0.269,0.9517
