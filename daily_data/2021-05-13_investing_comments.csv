1,ETH," As someone that regularly comes in here to argue in crypto's favor, this is a huge deal that can't really be understated.

ETH is already halfway to BTC's market cap.  This could legitimately lead to the ""flippening"" ETH folks have been wanting for so long.  Why?

7,ETH, Seems pretty simple to me. There is a strong risk that ETH overtakes BTC.

Hence the decision to no longer take BTC as payment.

18,ETH," I'll give it a quick pitch.  I'd argue that by a number of metrics, ETH is already bigger than BTC, and has room to grow.

ETH has a number of places creating demand that will drive price up in a sustainable way: as capital for staking; collateral for on-chain decentralized lending; and to pay for transactions on the network.  

Additionally, the upcoming lockdown of it's monetary policy will potentially make it deflationary.

---

**Staking:** Ethereum's Proof of Stake [""beacon chain""](https://beaconcha.in/) went live last november, and already has over $15 billion worth of ETH staked.  

The people running those validators (equivalent of miners) are currently being paid around 6% APY (ETH-denominated).  Attractiveness of that has been creating a sink on the circulating supply.

*(Technically PoS isn't in control of Ethereum's consensus yet -- the changeover from PoW is currently being tested, but targetting Q4-21)*.

---

**Collateral:** Ethereum has a huge ecosystem running on-chain.  One of the backbones of that is lending protocols like MakerDAO, Aave, and Compound.  

At the base, many of these are powered by people locking up their Ethereum as collateral, creating another sink on the circulating supply. 

DeFi currently has approximately [$78 billion](https://defipulse.com/) worth of collateral lock up on chain.

---

**Transactions:** ETH has to be used to pay for transactions on the network.  And it's doing more business than Bitcoin.

Ethereum has infamously high fees right now, but that's just because people are literally in a bidding war to get their transactions on-chain.  Fees used to be < 1 cent, but then the network got popular.  (There have been continual upgrades to increase it's capacity, but demand just keeps increasing to keep pace.  There are plenty more upgrades on the way).

Case in point for popularity is https://cryptofees.info/ -- look how much people are bidding to access the Ethereum network, compared even to Bitcoin (much less other coins).  I'd note -- all the rows in pink aren't other chains, those are projects running *on Ethereum*, which are generating their own fees on top of Ethereum transaction fees.

Another argument is the velocity of money https://money-movers.info/ -- Ethereum is already moving billions more per day than Bitcoin, and it's increasing.

---

**Monetary Policy** is being locked down, and is projected to become deflationary. 

PoW block rewards are currently increasing supply at around 4-5% per year.  However, once PoS takes over later this year, inflation will drop down to around 1%, due to the increased efficiency and lower costs of the tech.

More importantly though is Ethereum's London upgrade coming in July. Among other things, this will implement a ""burn"" where a portion of the ETH fee for each transaction will be destroyed.  **Think of the burn like a perpetual stock buyback based on a % of gross revenue** -- see cryptofees above for an idea of the gross.

Estimates are that this will burn the supply by around 0-3% per year, starting in July.  Note that when combined with the PoS upgrade, this means Ethereum's supply is estimated to be slowly deflating by 0-2% starting next year, and continuing indefinitely.

Staking, combined with the burn, is what has had a whole lot of people squirrelling away ETH as fast as they can.

---

\*edit\*:  Oh yeah, I should have mentioned: 

**Smart Contracts:** One of the main reasons Ethereum's Decentralized Finance (DeFi) movement is so huge is because of smart contracts. 

A lot of the lending projects I mentioned above (like MakerDAO and Aave) have people lending & borrow collateral.  Why are they willing to do this? Because smart contracts mean they can perform their daily operations on-chain, and people can borrow and lend *without anyone having to trust a middleman custodian* -- since the smart contracts provide the trust, and Ethereum secures it. 

This opens up a huge set of opportunities for financial operations to take place beyond simple ""let me move coins from A to B"" -- borrowing, lending, derivatives, NFTs, you name it.  And Ethereum literally pioneered the field here.  It's the reason the network exists.",ryebit,29,/r/investing/comments/nb164d/elon_musk_tesla_will_no_longer_accept_bitcoin_as/gxz8hke/,0.052,0.832,0.116,0.992

I like what I see in ETH for the most part, but it's still not hard to find coins that are less environmentally impactful. I do think there's still room for significant growth in ETH, albeit with a still-limited understanding. 

The lighter coins, especially ones designed to be eco-friendly, are appealing to me at first glance but I'll need to research each one before I can start to make moves.

33,DCF," Lots of comments here explaining that inflation drives stock prices down because it increases cost of new borrowing.  This might be true of some subset of the market (companies that need to borrow lots of cash all the time), but why would it impact companies with lots of cash on their balance sheets (the major tech companies) or companies that have large existing debt (which gets cheaper with inflation)?

I think what's being missed here is that we've *already had massive inflation* \-- in the prices of stocks in the market.  Why is core inflation bad for stocks in this environment? It's not just the interest rate risk of future debt for them (which can break either way and affects different stocks differently), *it's the risk of a change in the risk-free rate*.  Basically, asset inflation has been driven by the TINA crowd saying that, with a risk-free rate near zero, 2%-4% discount rates on stocks are ok.  If interest rates rise to fight core inflation, then 1%-3% returns might be available risk-free, meaning now the discount rate for equities rises to 4%-6%, driving down the value of future cash flows and the value of these stocks.  DCF is *highly non-linear* in the discount rate, meaning a couple of percentage point rise makes a huge difference in the net present value of the asset.

Prices in this market aren't just assuming gangbuster cash flow growth out many, many years, they are also assuming very, very low interest rates out many years.  This could be true -- 2%-4% could be the best anybody could hope for for a long time.  But these put the market in a precariously unstable point...because the discount rate really can't get lower, and profit assumptions are crazy high.  So it might work out that the prices are right, but really any change in the fundamentals is highly likely to be in the opposite direction.  Asset deflation will follow (sometimes rapidly, sometimes just a long horizontal period).  Personally, I've still been using a 10% discount rate in my screens.  Lots fewer opportunities, but those I do find are much safer long-term.

So should you sell? Well, I don't know -- that's up to you.  But if you've been invested for 5-15-25 years, and all the sudden you had a 40%-100% increase in the last year, was that really reasonable? I'd just stay invested and chalk up any reduction in prices to mean reversion and stay invested, because it wasn't ""real"" anyway and the long-term curve would still look good.

35,GDP," The Federal Reserve aims to keep inflation around two percent. One of the main ways they do this is by adjusting interest rates. Higher interest rates are generally bad for some companies for four reasons:

A) Companies with variable interest rates will see their interest payments increase (which means less profits)

B) Company valuation values future cash flow lower than present cash flow. Future cash flow is ""discounted"" using interest rates. For example: If i offered you 1000$ today or 1500$ dollars in a year, which would you chose? You would value the 1500$ in the future lower due to the time value of money, and it might only be ""worth"" 1460$ or something today. The same applies for company revenues/dividends (it's called discounted cash flow)

C) Higher interest rates means buying U.S treasury bonds is more attractive, and thus less money is invested in stocks/businesses

D) Higher interest rates means higher mortgage/credit card/consumer loan costs, which means less money going to consumption.

&#x200B;

Also in the U.S specifically there is research suggesting that the high debt levels might have adverse effects on GDP growth, and interest rate payments may have something to do with that.",Norre1,1,/r/investing/comments/nbcn9g/why_is_inflation_bad_for_stocks/gy0nnwg/,0.056,0.757,0.186,0.9792
36,DCF," At a base level, equities are worth the sum of their future discounted cash flows. Inflation directly decreases the value of future cash flows. Further, as inflation increases, one should expect interest rates to increase as well. This increases the discount rate, which, in a DCF, translates what inflation does to future cash flows by directly decreasing the value of future cash flows. 

Moderate inflation (let's assume something like 2-3%) should be fine for stocks because that should hurt fixed income more, but should still be readily translatable to earnings. However, inflation at a higher handle (let's say 4%) will hurt equities through the mechanism described above. 

As future cash becomes worth less, physical assets that pay off now (e.g. energy, ags, base metals, particularly those in backwardation) become worth more, which is why commodities act as a decent inflation hedge.",elev57,1,/r/investing/comments/nbcn9g/why_is_inflation_bad_for_stocks/gy0tkce/,0.055,0.792,0.152,0.7834

43,IMO," You’ve hit the nail on the head, IMO. If inflation continues to run hot, there will be lots of public pressure to do something about it, which is to raise interest rates. So, expecting higher rates, people would sell growth companies who require cheap debt.

But you’re also correct, the Fed has basically said “we aren’t even thinking about thinking about thinking about raising interest rates”. I think they’re being honest, even though the markets seem to be selling off in expectation of higher rates. I think there is simply too much debt, both public and private, for them to raise rates. The federal government has to refinance about $10T of the debt every year. If rates go up, government is fucked. Especially because they have increasingly refinanced into shorter-term treasuries to get the very lowest rates possible. Plus all these growth companies with crazy ratios and tons of debt would fold en masse. I think they simply won’t raise rates, even if they should.",-seabass,1,/r/investing/comments/nbcn9g/why_is_inflation_bad_for_stocks/gy050hj/,0.136,0.77,0.094,-0.8458

>I have family members that rent out residential properties and they seem to be doing fine

I mean, I think this is indicative of the mentality that many RE investors get in to.  Perhaps they are doing fine, who knows.  Real estate is an investment - so you should be charting that return with some very honest accounting to see what your capital is yielding, and comparing that return to other investments.  For me, if I've got a house with a cap rate of 6% then I'm selling it all day long.  Why take on all of the risks associated with individual property ownership for a return that can be matched by dumping it in an index fund and taking a nap?

For OP: You should realize if you have to ask r/investing then you clearly aren't ready to buy. Personally, trading/investing is a mental/psychological battle. A strong sense of conviction in your investing strategy coupled with a strong faith in both a company as well as the your homework on the company will allow you to hold the line and pick up more when the stock falls on bad news or keeps going up over the years.

89,UK," First post so go easy on me... 

I'm 28 and as many others also have I have started to be serious about investing in the stock market with savings accounts interest rates so low. I'm UK based and can invest 20k/yr within an ISA wrapper to avoid taxes on capital gains. 

I own a house, have approx 220k on my mortgage which has a locked in rate of 1.84% for the next 4.5 years. I have student debt of approximately 17k at 1.25%. I don't have any finance on cars etc. 

I have around 25k in savings and have kept back 10k as a rainy day fund so have 15k available to invest. 

I was originally planning on buying in at around £500/week in various funds to try and avoid lump summing it and then markets tanking (like they seem to be potentially doing currently!) 

My time horizon is initially around 7-8 years when I plan on upgrading the house, then long term towards retirement. Currently working full time in a secure job.

I realise I'm really lucky to have this opportunity to hopefully try and invest my money wisely but it seems there's a lot of uncertainty currently with post Covid recovery/inflation etc. My risk tolerance is fairly high I feel but probably hard to say until you experience it). 

Over the past few days there's been a fairly big tech sell off it seems and a lot of panic/fear. 

Would anyone consider a different approach to averaging in my money over the next 6 months? Would you put a decent lump sum in after corrections downwards?

90,EDIT," Man, I'm freaking out. I have been a buy & hold index fund investor for the 20 years of my adult life. It always sort of bothered me that I didn't understand the underlying mechanisms of the markets I was investing in. I read ""Random Walk"" and I think I understood most of it. But it was written at the beginning of the index fund craze, and at least the edition I read felt a little out of date.

Then I heard a Grantham interview and read some Hussman, and their gloomy prognostication really struck a chord with my natural inclination towards pessimism. What haunts me the most is that by any reasonable valuation metric, current prices are unthethered from the underlying assets, and this seems to be the case across all sectors of the market. Half of people seem to be throwing money at speculative investments and the other half are telling me to blindly invest in an index fund and forget about it, because 'historic returns'.

My armchair diagnosis is that there are a lot of people like me that are blindly investing in broad index funds that could care less about the underlying value of the assets as long as the price keeps going up, which it has done for a decade. I suspect at some time in the future we'll look back and see that index funds were a craze like any other and laugh at the certainly we currently feel that these assets will return 6-8% on average until the end of time.

I know you shouldn't try to time the market... Is not believing in the market at all the same as timing it?

So SPY does not have to re balance do to price changes

 Now things like stock issuance , or stock buy backs change the shares outstanding and therefore market cap and these numbers are only available when the company releases their quarterly statements so until they release those you have no clue if you need to re balance or not.
