A) Drew Markham/MVIS General Counsel and M&A Ace reviewed the MSFT/MVIS Contract/NDA and determined they were within their rights to disclose the relationship publicly (which gives MVIS significantly greater negotiating leverage in discussing an acquisition of the Near-Eye Display (NED) AR vertical, which powers the Hololens 2). The announcement puts significantly more pressure on MSFT to acquire the NED vertical, especially considering the national security risks associated with this critical IP being vital to the $22B US Army IVAS contract. The Department of Defense has conducted a thorough review and I‚Äôm sure they have identified that Microsoft not owning the rights to the ‚ÄúMiracle *MicroVision* Display Engine‚Äù represents a national security threat. It would make sense for the DoD to put pressure on MSFT to acquire this IP to prevent it from falling into enemy hands.

or

B) Microsoft gave MicroVision the green light to announce the relationship because MSFT is about to announce acquiring the NED vertical.

213,AR," Sure!

- No one outside the company has seen the lidar device, every time they say something positive about it, we just have to take their word for it
- They confirmed that they are basically dropping the AR business. I think they're even writing off some equipment related to it. From what I can tell, most people were drawn to this company when it was revealed that their stuff was in the Hololens... but if that business isn't being pursued, that doesn't seem like anything to get excited about
- It no longer seems that they are pursuing a buyout. A buyout would be the simplest way to make a quick buck on the stock, but if they're not pursuing that, it means that no one wants them (at the current price at least)

Basically, what I see (and what yesterday's EC confirmed) is a company with a proven track record of failure going all-in on a device no one has seen/independently tested. 

I don't blame them! If you have gullible shareholders willing to buy tens of millions of shares from you, then why not have some fun and try to make cool tech. It's fun!

Are Nobel prize winning chemists actually smarter than the guys at QS? Elon Musk has overseen companies that have successfully commercialized EV's and Space Flight, and I can't think of anyone key there that has won a Nobel Prize. Did Steve Jobs win a Nobel Prize, yet under him, Apple developed the most successful consumer electronic device in history. What about Jeff Bezos, who successfully did not blow himself up in his expensive free-fall ride, has he won a Nobel Prize? Investing in his company way back would have made you more money than looking for people with Nobel Prizes.

The fact is QS has, unless Singh is a dirty liar, made significant publicized process on solid-state batteries. Microvast has not. Comparing the two and their valuations is meaningless. Yeah, QS is pre-revenue and very speculative to invest in, but if they succeed in commercializing what they have shown so far, investors will make an easy 10-20X return.

And, seriously, people stop with the pointless bull about credentials that are irrelevant.

I've seen that video while doing my research.

To be quite honest, it just looks like the guy is smashing some random battery cell with a hammer lol  
It doesn't even look like there is electrolyte inside after the penetration test when he shows a close-up of the battery.  
And when you Google Translate the title of the video, it translates to ""Microvast battery crash test for e-bike battery""  
What makes me more skeptical is that there is no way the battery he ""tests"" in the video is for an e-bike. The dimension of that battery cell will never be able to fit inside a battery pack for e-bikes.  
For me, that video is disqualified as any kind of analysis or evidence for the safety of MVST battery cells.  


  
Like I said, I'm searching for videos from reputable testing companies with the tests done under set conditions and controlled laboratory settings.  


  
I would like to see certifications, testing standards or videos from reputable companies such as TUV Rheinland.

The DD here says:

>Microvast is a leading global provider of next-generation battery technologies for commercial and specialty electric vehicles.

So I am trying to understand 15M in revenue in Q1 2021 makes you a leading...?

>I‚Äôm not arguing QS should be worth less. I‚Äôm just saying if MVST is an already established company

>As you can see Microvast is an established multinational corporation with production all over the globe.

Again, per their own filings with the SEC, they had 15M in revenue in Q1 2021. This DD suggests something very different.

You say they have a wide range of products... Well 15M in revenue in Q1 2021 does not make it seem like they have that wide a range of products.

If you can't give a coherent story about where they are actually up to right now, why should anyone give much thought to suggestions that they are going anyplace with solid-state. It is an expensive and difficult process to figure out how to commercialize solid-state. QS has publicized info about where they claim they are up to (most recently 10 layer cells) and has claimed that VW, at least, was able to have access to their cells to validate their claims. What has MVST done but say they have 14 years of some sort of experience. Per Singh (interview with Sandy Munro) from QS their iterative process took, I think a 50 year iterative process down to 4 years, so time here and what you are doing to iterate quickly once you have what you think is a workable approach is a huge deal.

One last thing, I can't find mention of solid-state on MVST's website. Maybe some blurb someplace about working on developing a solid electrolyte which means next to nothing. QS claims to have a working separator that solves the dendrite problem. What QS likely has to solve, and this is a bigger deal than many will acknowledge, is scaling up this process to make cells with sufficient layers and in quantity. To me QS seems to have more of an engineering challenge to solve rather than a basic science challenge. MVST is still apparently on the basic science part. While the basic science is hard, the engineering to mass produce them might be just as hard if not harder, so as long as QS still has to go, MVST seems to have a lot longer to go.",aka0007,0,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oy8kd2/microvast_vs_quantumscape/h7ss22p/,0.027,0.921,0.053,0.8225

327,MVST," You have to be careful with warrants, most SPACs, which is what MVST merged with, have warrants, however there are conditions for when they can be called for redemption by the company.

This is usually to do with the common stock trading above a certain price for a certain period of time. Most commonly with SPAC mergers; this will be >$18 for 20 of 30 days.

In most cases, the company will call for warrants to be redeemed for shares when one of a few different criteria are met. If you fail to act on this, your warrants will be redeemed automatically by the company for a penny, so essentially expiring worthless.

The SEC filings will have the information for each SPAC regarding warrant redemption and the conditions allowing for them to be called.

Essentially though, you have it right.

>A Pump and Dump SPAC Scam By Silicon
Valley Celebrities, That Makes Theranos

>As we analyzed the few scraps of data QS has shared with
investors, we noticed numerous red flags. In particular, the
company goes to great lengths to conceal the capacity of
the prototype cells that are the basis of its far-reaching
claims. We consulted a leading academic, who concluded
the cells are less than 200mAh ‚Äì that is, less than 1/3th the
capacity of a common hearing aid battery.

>Leading experts indicated that one of the most common
tricks in battery research is using tiny cells with no useful
capacity to claim a ‚Äúbreakthrough.‚Äù The battery field is a
graveyard of companies that made far-reaching claims with
single-layer cells the size of a coin or credit card, that never
worked outside the lab. QS is worth $15B because investors
expect it to dominate batteries for electric vehicles ‚Äì off a
prototype with 5% of an iPhone battery‚Äôs capacity.

edit: if you aren't convinced, here are some more nuggets of information:

>The ‚Äúbattery fraud‚Äô‚Äù checklist even warns against specific
tricks prevalent in Quantumscape‚Äôs data presentation, such
as using misleading Y-axis scales for key metrics. 

>Y-axis is scaled from 0-100%, even
though the 4 test cells shown are all
between 95-100%

How did we get sufficient investment to buy 6.95M shares just today alone. Plus similar amounts the previous days. I don‚Äôt think so. What is much more likely is the EV market in general is looking strong as Biden was rolling out new targets and incentives for half the vehicle market to be EV by the end of the decade. It‚Äôs hard not to do well as a reputable battery maker when all machinery is becoming electric which places enormous demand on the battery market. With a tail wind like that the competition is meaningless as the world needs ALL of the batteries able to be produced by ALL the battery makers. At the same time the EV revolution is happening, so is the solar revolution which you guessed it also takes a gigantic amount of batteries. So how could it be possible for them to not sell every battery they can possibly produce?

959,ICE," There's no market share being eaten here. Only 2-3% of EVs are total all vehicle sales.

Tesla is shooting for 20% of worldwide market share, as Elon mentioned in prior earnings calls because he says Tesla cannot do it alone. Hence this is also why Elon has open sourced his EV technology to its competitors, to fulfill its mission to electrify the whole world.

So assuming Tesla succeeds to capture 20% market share, there's still 80% market share to be shared amongst other EV makers. Currently, Tesla's sold all cars it has produced, so it is its EVs that are eating into ICE sales, not the other way around. The reality is Tesla has a supply issue and are not able to meet its demand, so technically its still Tesla that is eating into the legacy automakers market share.

Legacy automakers also face a problem of cannibalizing their own ICE inventory to push forward their own EV segment. This means there will be big discounts on their ICEs, which will hurt bottom line.

I think the ones that will be at the top are Tesla, Volkswagen, Apple (if they get into the space), Ford, Volvo, \[Chinese EV brands\], Hyundai.

964,RIDE," F-150 lightning is hitting sales floors in large numbers 1Q 2022. Pre-orders are available now.

F-150 hybrids are selling now. 

F also has the best selling truck in America for the past 50+ years and a dealer/repair network across the country.

F also had a ownership stake in Rivian alongside Amazon.

I am not sure what you mean by frame ladder pickup?

The fraud claims against RIDE have arisen due to questions on their actual sales and I don't think that is solely BS from short sellers. I hope they figure it out and get going. Plenty of room for more players to shakeup the EV space.

965,RIDE," Cybertruck and Rivian are unibody.  There's a whole cottage industry of companies that buy pickup trucks, remove the bed, and replace it with a section that's task-centric as a work truck.  You can't replace the back half of a Rivian just the same as how you can't replace the back half of a Honda Ridgeline.

That leaves the Endurance and the Lightning as the only two viable options.  No matter how many sales the Lightning gets, there's still plenty of leftover sales for the Endurance especially since indications are such that it's being manufactured right now and the Lightning isn't.

1005,GENI," Smash & grab short seller Spruce Point blocked me on Twitter before releasing their ""report"" today on Genius Sports, which isn't even worth covering here. Clearly they were caught off guard by NFL deal and rushed their garbage out the door. Unlucky for them, Genius Sports and Draftkings $DKNG announced a comprehensive sports betting data deal today that is wide ranging, multi-league (including NFL) and multi-year that totally destroys their thesis.

Spruce Point is an activist short seller that gives select investors and friends an early view of their calls so they can front run the market before it's released to the public. These investors can short and then profit from the resulting panic selling (""smash & grab"").

I'm calling on Spruce Point to disclose 1) their GENI short position 2) when they released the report to their investors and friends 3) commit to not covering their short until at least 70% of their short target is realized and 4) unblock me so we can have a discussion.

1028,ICE," Nothing I said was factually incorrect. Certainly more substantial than your wild speculation on what Ford's margins are or what vehicle choice makes a consumer stupid or smart. 

Some of the best features on the Lightning that the Cybertruck doesn't have include bi-directional charging for powering homes, 11 onboard 240 & 120 volt outlets to power worksites, campsites, etc., intelligent range estimation including your trailer, zone-lighting, integrated fleet telematics services on the Pro model, and yes useful interior features like sleeper seats and a foldable table. 

It also shares a lot of parts and the body style of the ICE F-150, which Ford sells a million of annually and will absolutely help them lower costs on economies of scale, as well as allow customers to use their existing accessories with their EV F-150. 

I'm not trying to disparage the Cybertruck. I'm sure it will find a niche in the market when it finally arrives. You came in here trying to call it the be-all-end-all of EV trucks and I'm simply trying to explain that it's not.

You guys should really do something about your security. My account was breached these past few weeks and I couldn‚Äôt do anything about it.

The hacker logged into my account and loaded up on 8/6 HOOD 70C calls yesterday when it was trading for $85.

HOOD is now trading at $51.24 and each of those contracts is worth $60 now from almost $3000 yesterday. Rent is coming up so I‚Äôm going to need my money back.

1179,NVAX," Company has already guided filing EUAs during Q3. Why would it go up based on that?

During May quarterly report, they changed their guidance from June to the ""fall"", only a month notice before the delay there... and then there were murmurs that an EUA filing may happen in Philippines, or somewhere else, sometime by the end of July but that never happened.

On the other hand, if they announce a delay like ""end of Q3"" or any mention of Q4, then it goes -20% overnight.

After the move in the past 2 days, it would be plenty wise to take most, if not all, off the table. NVAX is unproven when it comes to bringing a product to the market.

I'm hanging onto 100 shares for now. I do think India EUA approval, further orders in light of strong variant data coming out now, and UK/EU filings, will keep us going strong into end of Q3.

*""2)It infers that options market makers needed to purchase stock in order to hedge their exposure""*

*""As you can see below, right after the market opened there was a surge in positive delta activity (green line) which is likely call buying. In effect there was a gamma squeeze right at the open. This in turn pushed the stock price to an initial high near $80 (red arrow). Shortly after the stock reverted strongly as options flows turned bearish ‚Äì traders bought puts and sold calls (blue arrow).""*

*""Notice that after the blue arrow the options delta stays flat. This suggests that options trading was directionally neutral, and remained that way up until ~2PM EST. At that point the options flow turned quite bullish (green arrow), which coincided with the stock pinning the $70 strike.""*

Chart 2:  https://imgur.com/gallery/a5YjNqO

*""As noted above, $70 was the highest available strike for options yesterday. Our EquityHub data shows that is exactly where most traders now hold the bulk of call positions, and the strike which SpotGamma considers the key options strike for today. Given this, we think its no coincidence that the stock closed right at $70 last night.""* 

Chart 3:  https://imgur.com/gallery/v8ICgue

*""Today the exchanges have now listed options strikes up to $170, which gives traders a whole new set of calls to purchase. This may setup a further gamma squeeze in HOOD as traders push into these higher strike calls. We think retail traders in particular are attracted to these higher strikes as they generally cost less (from a premium perspective) making them more accessible to traders with smaller assets.""*

*""For a gamma squeeze to continue we want to see the stock trade over $70, with todays call volumes in the order of several hundred thousand. That volume needs to show particularly at strikes in the $75-100 range. This should keep the pressure on dealers to buy the stock which could keep the gamma squeeze in motion. If the stock cannot hold $70, then dealers may be able to start an unwind of their long stock hedges, which could pressure the stock back lower.""*

*""The other factor here is time. The bulk of the current options position does not expire until 8/20, which means that the decay of those call positions is a bit slower than we may see in typical gamma squeezes. Most often traders pile into the weekly expirations, with only ~5 days to expiration. We‚Äôve documented this phenomenon here. The fact that there is more time to expiration on these RobinHood calls could work to the benefit of bullish traders.""*",MomolanZozolan,6,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oydmm5/fraternal_association_of_gambling_gentlemen_and/h7szctv/,0.044,0.92,0.035,-0.3182

1245,SOFI," Well, I'm up over 400 (Bit over 1%) today despite losing almost 400$ on Wayfair. Yay for risk management, and not being able to buy a second pair of puts due to the wide bid-ask I guess? My week so far.

1. Corsair earnings play which took me for 1500 dollars, only to see it recover to 29 briefly today. Probably should have let my protective collar do its thing, and given it time since I had till August 20.
2. Made some of that money up by making roughly 320 net profit on SOFI PMCC calls in the space of a quarter of a day. 
3. Sold a pair of Wayfair poor man puts for a little under 400 for August 27. Keeping them, since there's no use selling and you never know the stock could drill due to macro. Down 85%, or 328$ on them. 
4. Sold 2 Viacom 38 CSP's for 200. Those came back all for me. Got 200 shares of Viacom CBS, and sold 1 38.5 for 1.14, and 1 43 for this Friday. The 38.5 will net me a 3.6% return roughly for holding it for 3 days. I'll likely keep the last 100 shares, and keep selling CC's on it. That's  a total net ofth 325 in premium, plus an additional 25 when those shares get called away.
5. Made good money on my Viacom bet, but should have bought calls instead  instead of Wayfair puts. Up 8.5% on the shares I'll keep in 2 days.
6. Just bought 10 10$ August 20 calls for Alight at .45 a pop. IV is only in the mid 50's, earnings are on August 12 and I like the company and think it's poised for a good quarter. Looking to add to the 3 Feb calls I already have to add to that when I can get a good entry point.

So far I am down roughly 1,158 in realized losses, even though I'm up on unrealized (Shares).",Hani95,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oydmm5/fraternal_association_of_gambling_gentlemen_and/h7uaji4/,0.026,0.878,0.096,0.9598
