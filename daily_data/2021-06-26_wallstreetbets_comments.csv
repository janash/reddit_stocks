I mean, I like that I don't have to worry too much about Fidelity not letting me buy/sell GME, but the amount of clicks and loading time just to get to the place where I can buy an option is absolutely ridiculous everywhere except Robinhood.

Some examples of where other brokers fail in terms of API:

* Drop downs to select which options we want to view instead of just showing us everything with a scrollbar for a given date. Why is the default showing us like 5 ITM options? 

* More drop downs once we click an option to tell us what we want to do, be it buy/sell/close etc. 

* Making us enter limit prices instead of just giving us a default (Fidelity isn't too bad, you still have to click the bid/ask price. TDA is awful)

* Making us hit a refresh button to see the actual price NOW after we've done all this since its definitely changed since then, instead of just updating automatically and showing the correct price

* Not showing the underlying's value in real time (I mean, this is pretty important if you're trying to buy an option, right?)

All in all, while I do like that they'll fill faster, it still takes me like 5 minutes of sifting through tiny text and awful interfaces to actually purchase the damn thing and often the trade is gone by that point.

33,PII," I'm not super knowledgeable about options, just starting out trading options myself. I'll try and answer what I can, and hopefully some more knowledgeable apes here can help us/correct me if I say anything wrong. Figure the best way to learn is to post and see if I'm right or wrong lol.

You are correct 1 contract is equal to controlling 100 shares. I actually bought 100 calls at a 40$ strike price. I just edited out PII from the Screenshot, and instead of leaving the order number blank I figured I'd throw in a little starwars Easter egg for the fellow nerd apes.
I bought the calls last Thursday (6/17 the share price was around 35$ IIRC) paying a premium of $2.45 per share so each contract I bought was $245. To control 100 shares I paid 245$ instead of 3,500. Now multiply this buy 100 because I bought 100 contracts so (10,000 shares) with the strike price (right to buy the shares) at 40$ (and add 1$ per contract for Vanguard's commission. I needed the share price to go above 42.46$ to break even (strike price + premium paid).

Yea i just sold all the contracts Friday morning on the news of FAA approval. I could have been greedy and held them longer, but it was at the upper end of my exit price pre market already. I told myself I'd get out if the shares were around 45-50$ on Friday giving me an estimated sell price of 100k. I figured it had room to grow a bit more, and if it doesn't sell today I can aways wait for the flight planed for July 4th MERIKA FUCK YA! I set a limit order before going to work to sell all 100 contracts for 15$ (1,500$ per contract remember we are talking in terms of 100 shares per contract), and it printed right as I was getting on the highway to work, near the high of the day. I was happy netting 130k in gains, yes I could have waited for the flight, but what if it got postponed. Since my expiration date was so close to the flight I didn't want to risk it. I still have shares in the company for the long haul, I'm just exploring options for short term trades.

As for who bought the calls, hopefully another space ape with $550,000 to pay me and buy those shares at 40$ instead of 80$ or higher on a successful flight. And for why, wouldn't you rather buy shares at 40$ instead of 80$ you can turn around and sell for a profit right away or hold to purchase your space ticket. Selling/buying the contracts I'd say is similar to selling /buying stocks. With Vanguard I can't do market orders for options, only limit orders, set the price you want, when someone wants to buy at that price they meet you behind a Wendy's to trade Pokémon cards and blowies.

What I want you to do is to go on Yahoo Finance. Look up Apple chart and select Max. You will discover that Apple was trapped in a small tight range under 10 for nearly two and half decades. Steve Jobs took seven years to convince the skeptics and the iPhone was introduced in 2007 and only until 2010 that Apple instituonal Investors bought into Steve Jobs vision. From 1985 until 2010
The stock was stagnant. It takes 10 years for a tech company to be fully transitioned from hardware to software. John Chen did a miraculous job and he beat Steve Jobs in Blackberry's turnaround time.

226,PTON," I completely see your points regarding this stock, and I personally don't see this company ever coming up to PTON's level, but it could easily get to Nautilus's level which is a 2-3x bagger (within a year or possibly around merger). They also have a headstart on Nautilus with content, subscribers and equipment.

Beachbody has been around for years, and I'd say that, although they have a lot of subscribers and have managed to operate with free cash flow, yeah, they plateaued. They had some big successes like P90x and Insanity, but the company style became quite outdated and didn't make the pivot online as well or quickly as they could have.

However, what makes me bullish is that they are now entering a growth tech field at bargain basement prices, and, importantly, have the ex-Disney+ and Tik Too CEOs guiding it. I wouldn't be investing if it was only the original Beachbody CEO doing it since I don't think they could do the pivot well enough. I'm looking to see a brand image overhaul and plenty of marketing. 

I think $BODY will have to be aggressive with growth at first, and yeah, this could reduce profits for a couple years like it did for PTON, but for me it still has great potential for stock price growth in the current market. I also that they have their content and equipment ready with established sales history in place. As long as PTON is doing well, I see good reason to get excited for this one.

I buy and sell ATM or a bit ITM calls weekly churning stocks sometimes regularly.  If it drops, your adjusted value due to premiums usually covers it.  Then you sell the next week the CC you want and can leave a little upside.  4-7% weekly aint bad.

280,MU," MU is on track to exceed all expectations for their earnings report on Wednesday. Their earnings report is likely positive for Q3 and leading into Q4, but they will need to prove that their cyclical lows after the current highs can be over-ridden by the huge surge they have been experiencing since pandemic hit.     

Safest strat: Slowly load up on calls expiring on July 2nd and stocks to pump options for short term gains. Sell off calls leading to the earnings report (4:30 EST on Wednesday June 30th which is after market close) and lock in free money and hold a few to YoLo on good earnings report.   

$YoLo STRAT: Load up on calls at open Monday and dump at open Thursday after the (extremely likely to be) positive earnings report on Wednesday after market close.    

I bought 16 calls at market open so I'm going full YoLo$ for after earnings report. Going to post my biggest gains or biggest losses on here next Friday, wish me Luck you stanky Apes ;)

345,VERY," Only discovered day trading maybe a month and a half ago and can see how this would happen.  My girl goea to the casino and almost every time she has a win, doubles down, to lose it all.

Whew.   And then shes borrowing money from me on her next chexk cause im the saver.  Tough to get ahead in life when your partner isnt there financially, or rather makes money but gives it to the casino usually within days....

I think that if you have a gambling addiction its hard to cut down, and VERY hard to stop that train.

Its silly to suggest that you step away for awhile because thats obviously not happening, so ill just say the others have great advice for you.  Let go of options, small plays for dopamine rushes.

347,RSI," It is easy to make bad trades from revenge trading, being too tired to trade or out of boredom. When revenge trading or trading while tired you forget things or simple rules like not checking RSI first or doing much research and then you are staring at a 70% loss the next day thinking it would recover (it didn't and usually will not) on weekly options. 

Rules to live by.

1. If you must trade a weekly option hold it no longer than a few hours, don't hold over night and never buy on Monday to hope for a miracle on Friday. 

2. Make sure the stock movement is nearing the end of a trend and buy calls or puts in the correct direction. Check RSI, don't buy puts if it's below 30 and don't buy calls if its above 70. More so if it is a weekly. 

3. Don't trade out of boredom.

4. Be patient, don't fomo, cash is a position too, wait for a good setup to happen with a lot of research behind it. 

5. Take your gains even if it is only 10-20%. Those gains add up over time and are way less risky. 

6. Do not turn a profit into a loss by thinking it will go even higher.

7. Watch out for offerings after a pump on crap penny stocks. 

8. Spy is the easiest stock to option trade if you are a technical trader. If you need to options trade do it on the Spy, stop trading options on crap penny stocks. Spy is almost too predictable with textbook patterns and easier to trade using just the RSI. Why? Because the hive mind of everyone trading in those same patterns.

9. Don't be a dumbass after a big winning trade that you have it together and can't lose. 

10. Don't get the attitude that, ""My bills are paid, this is just house money at this point."" and make risky yolo plays just because. You will lose your hard earned winnings very quickly by trying to have fun instead of making money. 

The biggest advice is to not even trade options and to trade stocks. It may seem harder to do with a small account because a 10% gain on $100 is only $10. However it is better than buying a weekly only for it to theta burn 49% by the next day forcing you to sell at a huge loss.",Key_nine,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o8dj0n/revenge_traders_how_do_you_stop/h34wsds/,0.101,0.77,0.128,0.9339

Nokia Target at Wall Street High as Goldman Likes 5G-Spending Prospects

Goldman Sachs upgraded Nokia stock, 'factoring in a better 5G spending backdrop, wireless product progress and [market]-share gain potential.'

Nokia  (NOK) shares rose on Friday after Goldman Sachs analyst Alexander Duval upgraded the communications equipment company to buy from neutral.


He raised his price target to $6.50 from $4.90, giving him the highest target of analysts tracked by Bloomberg.

Duval said he’s “factoring in a better 5G spending backdrop, wireless product progress and [market]-share gain potential.”

Nokia recently traded at $5.53, up 7.5%. It has surged 42% over the past six months.

“Nokia has underperformed peer Ericsson ERIC by 75% (and European tech by 67%) in the last three years,” Duval said. 

That’s due to “lagging wireless equipment product quality, share losses and negative earnings-per-share revisions. However, we see scope for upside.”


First, “wireless market demand continues to improve, driven by 5G,” he said.

Second, “there is evidence that Nokia’s wireless base-station product position for 5G is improving, suggesting they can regain their place as a key tech enabler for cellular connectivity.”

And third, “we see scope for [market]-share gains from Chinese vendors such as Huawei, especially in Europe,” Duval said.

Nokia’s first-quarter earnings beat analyst expectations. Revenue increased 3% to 5.08 billion euros ($6.16 billion), beating analysts' forecast of $4.74 billion.


Net income totaled $451.5 million, or about 7 cents a share, beating analysts' consensus estimate of 1 cent a share.

In March, Nokia unveiled a five-year deal with AT&T  (T)  to help expand the telecom giant's 5G network coverage in the U.S.

Under the agreement, Nokia will provide its latest fifth-generation equipment to power 5G on AT&T’s C-Band network.",Two2Rails,9,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o861m1/goldmans_upgrades_nok_to_buy_with_pt_of_650/h333670/,0.043,0.793,0.164,0.9871

527,ES," Hey guys. A hot take for next week. SPX smashed through the 90 dollar expected move weekly options priced in and AMAZINGLY volatility got crushed on Friday implying only a 50 pt move next week. LOL 😂. 

I will be a buyer of short term volatility and optionally sell the jacked up longer term vol to finance. What I’ve noticed is that when markets start to become inefficient, it actually leads to more inefficiency which presents opportunity.

Costco doesn't have employees. 75% of the people you see ""working"" at Costco aren't employees. Those sample ladies? Contract employees. The Costco call center? Contract labor. The Verizon booth? Duh. Outside of a manager, a customer service person, a receipt slave, and a few general stock slaves, Costco doesn't have the manpower like Target does.

588,EVER," The public short interest of GME is like < 17% currently, not 140% as it had been back early Jan before the price went from $15ish to almost $500 (hint: many of the old shorts had to cover. That was the entire point of the rally).

\[and yes, I understand the % is most likely under reported because institutions don't have to share.\]

Just on retail brokerages alone (e.g.: IBKR, Fidelity, Merrill, etc), there's MILLIONS of available legal shares to short GME (this was not the case until the past two weeks+). And the fee to short is like less than two dollars a year per share. Then there's institutional brokerages with possibly even far more legal shares available to short.

So... what are all these cultists talking about. Who knows.

If shorts don't have to cover when price goes from $4 to $500ish on January, then why should they ever need to cover. Say they shorted 10% of their money. $4 to $500 means that 10% became 1250%. And GME margin call requirements became like 3\~5x in many brokerages (and high fees) during Jan squeeze.

So if someone had $1000 and shorted at $4 20% of his/her money, that someone would have by share price of $500 had a brokerage account with net worth of -$1500. Yes. NEGATIVE $1500. If you truly believe no one ever needs to cover when in negative money, then why should those group EVER need to cover. At that point, you have to accept the entire US Govt is corrupt and you will never win. Clearly, what's to stop institutions from having negative infinity dollar net worth?

Oh and by the way, institutions like Citadel have been reporting record level profits this year. Apparently all this retail stupidity has helped market makers like Citadel (who took both positions) make a net profit in tens of billions of dollars.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: You are probably deep in a MLM pyramid like structure cult. It's a pump and dump scheme.

Also, if you never sell, then you never realize profits. That means you never made money. You do know.. to make money, you buy low sell high in the stock market, right? Money doesn't come out of thin air. It requires active participants on both sides.

Plus, most of in real life people I know (including me) have promoted to keep holding/buying while selling ourselves at a profit. You never thought that maybe many people here want you to keep buying/holding so they can sell quietly at a huge profit?

Also, shorts WANT the price to go up. Just short at $320+ and cover at $200s (will also increase price). Hope other idiots join and pump up the stock again. Then rinse and repeat. I wouldn't be surprised if shorts are also doing regular buys in order to make prices to go up in hopes even more suckers go in. Got to milk dumb money as much as possible when you can. Plus, hedging these is so cheap by buying those unrealistic calls. A few thousand dollars can hedge against hundreds of thousands of dollars easily. So those hedging (insurances) while shorting exists too. Then there's also continuously selling impossible puts/calls to make money from those premium. Imagine someone buying 5 cent puts of GME.

Remember, money is made from both sides. There is nothing wrong with both going long and short and making money from the volatility. You are in the stock market to profit (I think). Only risk what you are willing to lose in the stock market.

How incredibly flawed your understanding of Intel’s fabrication abilities and their architecture. How long have you been following Intel? 3 seconds?

616,AMD," Intel almost killed AMD now that AMD is fighting back it should help intel push back, I bet they get a big fat check from the gov to build out more Chips, Yes they could have done it years ago but why when they didn't need too. 

My guess drops a few more points before slowly pushing up, sub 40-45 range and pushes back to 75 once it stops sucking so hard, it's a long play.",gharg99,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o85951/intel_23_itm_calls/h332snq/,0.103,0.81,0.086,-0.091
