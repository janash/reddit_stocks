1,MSFT," One thing you could consider is looking at variation over time, compared to a historical baseline.

For example, let's say on an average day in January you typically had 3 funds buying MSFT, and 7 selling. All of a sudden, in February, you see this changes to 6 buying, and 4 selling. This would lead me to believe that something abnormal has happened relative to historical activity, and could be worth digging into further. You could apply the same logic to total number of funds transacting in a given security.

10,EV," Having been investing and actively trading since 1998, this has an eerily similar feel to 1999.  It is that time when everyone is jumping into the market. The hot topic of every conversation is their returns on whatever stock and whatever speculative stock de jour is.  Over the past 2 years, the conversation has evolved from an occasional discussion of whether to buy apple/facebook to tsla to non revenue generating early stage companies with valuations in the billions to penny stocks that 'went up 7x in 5 days!'.

This is also a market where you can't lose.  I am use to seeing my portfolio move up and down by a few hundred to maybe 2-3k on a very special day.  Currently, I am seeing my portolio move by 4 figures regularly (more up than down). While not every stock is up every day, there is definitely certain flavors where a stock would go up by 4-5% over a few days, consolidate while other stocks in my portfolio would go up 4-5%.  I have also been holding some losers for years, thinking I would use them for tax loss harvesting.. however even those are green. I don't know if I am more sad that I cannot TLH or to be happy about the gainz.

While it is certainly euphoric, the last time I felt like this was in 1998 where I though i was going to be the next hot shot wall street banker.  I recall trading 10k into \~150k at the peak and thinking I was hot shit.. every stock I touched went up by 5-50%.  I was looking at my portfolio every few minutes and I was glued to the computer screen. I recall bragging to my dad about my accomplishments. He gave me a side eye telling me to cash some out and put into some boring companies. Of course I didn't and rode it back down to maybe 25k.. anyone would be ecstatic about 150% gains, but I was depressed and scared of investing for the next 5 years because I 'lost' 125k.

I can tell from talking to my current colleagues who are relatively new to active investing how euphoric they are to be seeing 40% gains since November thinking they are investing gods.  I recall debby downers in 1999 talking about valuation and me responding with 'this time is different, its a new economy', fundamentals no longer work.  Even Warren Buffet admits to not understanding internet stocks.  Its all about growth and not profit, that will come later. Back then we were talking about internet companies, today it is early stage EV SPACS and gig economy companies that have no pathway to profitability.

This time its going to be different, until its not.",greenerdoc,213,/r/investing/comments/ljclbp/found_some_articles_dated_back_to_the_dotcom_bust/gncjdh9/,0.051,0.859,0.091,0.9275

18,EV," The difference with Tesla is they make electric vehicles which are the future as opposed to traditional auto makers whose main product will be slowly phased out over the next 20 years. Yes legacy manufacturers are investing in EV but that brings me to my second and more important point.

Tesla is cutting edge and innovative. Innovation almost always leads to serious profits no matter the industry never mind an industry that is just getting off the ground and has huge support from government and the public. Tesla is just as much a technology company as a car company. They have made advances in everything from materials science to battery technology to auto driving software and likely tons of other things I am forgetting. This is why Tesla is not overvalued.

29,XOM," Only a few narrow sectors are like the dot com bubble - Electric Vehicles and maybe weed.

In the dot com era, *everything* was trading like it was going to end up like AMZN or MSFT.  It was even just tech stocks, it was virtually everything.  Some run of the mill widget manufacturer would open up a website to sell their widgets, change their name to WidgetsRus.com and the stock would double over the next 3 months.  It was 100% speculation with no reality.

And that's how EV stocks are trading right now.  They're not all going to be the winner.  One, or a few of them will.  The ones who don't will will drop like a rock.  The ones that do win are probably close to fairly valued right now.  There is no guarantee, of course, that TSLA will be a winner.

38,DIS," > The market as a whole is currently trading at P/E’s that have only been seen in bubbles before big crashes.

My argument against this is that you're either looking at trailing P/E ratios or forward looking P/E ratios.

If you're looking at trailing P/E ratios, well, we've been in a worldwide pandemic for the past year.  While that has been a windfall for some companies, the vast majority have been damaged by it.  So is a company like Disney or Buffalo Wild Wings trading at high trailing P/Es?  Of course they are, because the past 12 months doesn't represent typical operations.

If you're looking at forward P/E ratios, then what are those forward looking earnings based upon?  Because if you look at actual earnings vs. analysts expectations, 80% of companies are beating them - frequently substantially.

53,ABC," ATT I've got nothing for ya.

DIS I am super, super bullish - primarily because of Disney+.  Disney's market cap is about $340B.  Netflix is about $260B - so not a huge difference.

Netflix has around 200 million subscribers and transitioned from mailing out DVDs to streaming in 2007 (14 years ago).  Disney+ has just shy of 100 million subscribers and launched in November 2019 (14 months ago). I see no reason that Disney+ can't or won't duplicate Netflix's content library, plus have all the Lucasfilms, Marvel and Disney animation content on top of it.

To me, that means that in 5 years, possibly 8-10, Disney+ will have replaced Netflix as the default streaming service (which is still a growing industry as cord-cutting continues).  Disney has gotten half as many subscribers in 14 months as NFLX got in 14 years.  I don't know when Disney will pass them, but I wouldn't be shocked if it's less than 3 years from now.  And once they've got critical mass, they can gradually raise their rates to NFLX levels.

So in a nutshell, my opinion is that you're essentially going to have a NFLX inside of DIS within 5 years.  And if NFLX is worth 75% of DIS today, then what is DIS worth when they've got a streaming service that is beating NFLX?

You couple that with the parks, ESPN, cruise line, ABC, movie studios, and all the other shit that Disney owns and I think you've got a big winner for a long-term hold over the next decade.  Is it going to 10X and be a $3.5 Trillion company a decade from now?  Doubtful.  But is it going to go up consistent with little risk of significant decline?

I asked about ATT because I see them a lot like Disney just not as well managed. Like Disney they have content and IP. Their app just launched and needs to gain traction tho (hence Disney’s better management). Where I see potential in ATT is their other areas. Disney has parks etc. ATT has the internet. They can install it in your house, and give you a cellphone service too. Pretty integrated. Put the internet in your house, a cellphone in your hand and an app to watch their content on. 

I do wonder why they haven’t forced people to get the app tho. Like manage your internet and cell account via our HBOmax app. Maybe be illegal to do that tho. I’m not sure. Long term I look at ATT as a lot of potential. With the right management like Disney and the stock can shoot up. It’s a cheaper entry level stock too at around 30 bucks.

62,USA," I am getting to the age where I should have been investing in my retirement 10 years ago. However, I just was not savvy or have enough ""disposable income"" to make it happen. Plus the interest just was not there.

Now looking into the different options out there it is a bit overwhelming. And am unsure of which direction to head with my investments.

&#x200B;

I am 34 and reside in central USA.

I am a Systems Engineer making 85k a year.

Looking to save for the next 30 years for my retirement.

I am currently very risk-tolerant, have my investments set aggressive.

Currently, I have several thousand in Bitcoin, several thousand in odds and ends stocks that I play with on a weekly basis (fun money more or less), and just over 1.5k into an Acorn aggressive investment account. It breaks down as such, (55% - VOO, 30% -  IXUS, 10% -  IJH, and 5% - IJR) Currently it has gained 5.82%.

Unmarried guy, minimal bills and 0 debt. It takes less than 1.5k a month for all living expenses.

I am currently looking at saving around 30% of my net income, around 1.8k a month.

&#x200B;

My question is as follows. How do I go about investing these savings? I have an Acorns investment account that has sparked this interest in investments and planning for the future. I like it as it is an automatic way for me to set it and forget it. Automatic pulls from my direct deposit, max my IRA and then the rest of the 30% is dropped into the investment account.

I am questioning which is the best path to follow. I just opened a Roth IRA and was/am planning on investing the max 6k. As well as quit playing around with stocks myself and dumping the rest of my investments into the 4 stocks mentioned earlier. According to my research, the best/recommended investment strategy is to max out one's IRA, then 401k and then dump what is left into stocks.

Maybe it is me not understanding tax law as well as I should. But at my age, the average amount that an IRA will net me is 500k at the time of retirement. Whereas if I would just dump all that money into stocks instead I would average about 1.7M by the time I am 65. Assuming an average rate of return. I understand that there are certain breaks in taxes with the IRA vs taxes I would have to pay on stock investments. But could someone enlighten me as to why I would even want to mess with an IRA instead of just dumping it all into the market?

To me, it just seems that the IRA is a waste as it just will not return the gains that I would want, and that 6k would be better served earning a higher percentage that would result in higher compounding interest in the long run. Or am I just not seeing the tax benefits?

63,VS," I am getting to the age where I should have been investing in my retirement 10 years ago. However, I just was not savvy or have enough ""disposable income"" to make it happen. Plus the interest just was not there.

Now looking into the different options out there it is a bit overwhelming. And am unsure of which direction to head with my investments.

&#x200B;

I am 34 and reside in central USA.

I am a Systems Engineer making 85k a year.

Looking to save for the next 30 years for my retirement.

I am currently very risk-tolerant, have my investments set aggressive.

Currently, I have several thousand in Bitcoin, several thousand in odds and ends stocks that I play with on a weekly basis (fun money more or less), and just over 1.5k into an Acorn aggressive investment account. It breaks down as such, (55% - VOO, 30% -  IXUS, 10% -  IJH, and 5% - IJR) Currently it has gained 5.82%.

Unmarried guy, minimal bills and 0 debt. It takes less than 1.5k a month for all living expenses.

I am currently looking at saving around 30% of my net income, around 1.8k a month.

&#x200B;

My question is as follows. How do I go about investing these savings? I have an Acorns investment account that has sparked this interest in investments and planning for the future. I like it as it is an automatic way for me to set it and forget it. Automatic pulls from my direct deposit, max my IRA and then the rest of the 30% is dropped into the investment account.

I am questioning which is the best path to follow. I just opened a Roth IRA and was/am planning on investing the max 6k. As well as quit playing around with stocks myself and dumping the rest of my investments into the 4 stocks mentioned earlier. According to my research, the best/recommended investment strategy is to max out one's IRA, then 401k and then dump what is left into stocks.

Maybe it is me not understanding tax law as well as I should. But at my age, the average amount that an IRA will net me is 500k at the time of retirement. Whereas if I would just dump all that money into stocks instead I would average about 1.7M by the time I am 65. Assuming an average rate of return. I understand that there are certain breaks in taxes with the IRA vs taxes I would have to pay on stock investments. But could someone enlighten me as to why I would even want to mess with an IRA instead of just dumping it all into the market?

To me, it just seems that the IRA is a waste as it just will not return the gains that I would want, and that 6k would be better served earning a higher percentage that would result in higher compounding interest in the long run. Or am I just not seeing the tax benefits?

64,AMD," So, I’m 26 and just got a new job which allows me to invest roughly $2 000 every month during the coming 1,5 years. I have $12 000 in cash right now that I’m looking to invest as soon as possible. 

My target goal is to reach $60 000, preferably within 1,5 years. In any other circumstances, I would never have these types of short-term goals, and I realise the amount of risk involved. After I reach $60 000 I’ll transition into something less risky. For now, I’m game to gamble, somewhat. I’m willing to take medium to high risks.

So what should I do with the $12 000 I have on hand? And how should I go about investing $2 000 every month? 

I’ve picked a few EFTs I’d like to spread about $6 000 to: VTI, ARK Genomic, ARK innovation, ARK Next Generation Internet, ARK Autonomous Technology & Robotics. 

Then I have a few stocks for the remaining $6 000: AMD, Disney, Evolution Gaming Group, Apex Technology Investment Corporation, Palantir, Darling Ingredients, Energy Fuel, Crowdstrike, and Twilio. 

Too risky? Is this the equivalent of going to a casino and putting it all on red? Should I go with more or less stocks/EFTs? Or should I be looking into going more into something that is less tech?",Noouri,1,/r/investing/comments/ljlr27/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gndvhss/,0.033,0.887,0.08,0.8792

I am looking for advice. Is there a broker like Webull where there is a comment section or ability to see social media like twitter built in?  
Not looking for just a social media score, where they simple give a number.  
It is nice to see when a stock gets super hyped.  
Basically I like seeing when rocket ships appear, so I know when to bolt or at least considering to bolt.

Webull for those that don't know has a built in comment section. Think: stocktwits built into Webull.   
From what I can see Fidelity has a social media sentiment score, but you don't actually see the social media posts.   
If there is a broker that has posts, I'm looking for general users like you and I, not just analysts.

Here’s what I’m considering:
  
-SPY (I like the dividend potential)
- ESGV  (I like this US.stock ETF but I can’t find much data on it?)
- FSCSX  (software and IT seem like a smart investment. This also looks to have good returns, if I’m reading the info correctly)
- SCHE ( emerging markets ETF.  Low risk I think and has a nice international blend)
- SWISX (international index that looks to have promising performance)

88,RE," I love Cathie Wood. The catch will be that on market corrections those stocks will cut the other way too, their losses will be worse that the general market, most likely. 

If you only go half in, you know it going to run for two more years. If you go all in you know the market will crash ;) That would favor dripping into the market or going with your more defensive SPY included allocation.... though SPY is hardly defensive. Maybe a dividend vehicle would be a better choice (instead of SPY), esp in a bear market. This market is crazy. A correction has to happen, in a week, or a year, of five. No one knows. Inflation could be here now and it is in the market, not where ppl expect to see it. This could be the new normal... no telling.

I always ask myself what would hurt more (I ask this about selling stocks too). Going half in and having the market run away from me for years?  Going all in and there is a 20% crash that I cant buy the dip on because I am already in? I think allocation to both would smooth things out no matter what the market does. I would also diversify into non-market correlated vehicles. 5% in crpyto maybe. I think /BTC to 100k is not unreasonable. GLD, RE, collectibles,

89,IMO," I persoanlly would recommend to be careful with ARK funds. They are funds which means that they have to deal with in/outflows at bad times. Ontop of that they are mostly invested into small companies with low-ish market caps which can easily be artificially pushed up by fund inflows and thus show high short term returns due to  inflated prices.

I'm not saying those companies are bad or that the fund(managers) wont perform but i am seeing that they are holding very expensive companies and performed unsustainably well. What would happen if they would underperform the market for let's say a year? IMO too risky to be worth it.

> Space’s net sales in 2020 increased $1.0 billion, or 9%, compared to 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to higher net sales of approximately $525 million for government satellite programs due to higher volume (primarily Next Gen OPIR); and about $430 million for strategic and missile defense programs due to higher volume (primarily hypersonic development programs, inclusive of impacts due to the acquisition of i3's hypersonics portfolio in November 2020).

>Space’s  operating  profit  in  2020  decreased  $42  million,  or  4%,  compared  to  2019.  **Operating  profit  decreased  approximately  $90  million  for government satellite programs** due to lower risk retirements on the various programs (primarily AEHF) that were partially offset by higher risk retirements and volume on the Next Gen OPIR program. **This decrease was partially offset by increases of $40 million for commercial satellite programs due to charges recorded for performance matters in 2019 not repeated in 2020**. Operating profit for strategic and missile defense programs was comparable as higher risk retirements and volume on hypersonic development programs were offset by lower risk retirements and volume on fleet ballistic missile programs. **Adjustments not related to volume, including net profit booking rate adjustments, were $100 million lower in 2020 compared to 2019.**

>Backlog decreased in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to higher sales on multi-year contracts awarded in prior years. Additionally, backlog as of December 31, 2020 reflects a decrease due to the UK Ministry of Defense’s intent to assume 100% ownership of the program on June 30, 2021.

87% of LM Space's net sales are US Government customers and 13% are international. Overall, compared to Lockheed's entire portfolio, commercial space is a very small percentage and also doesn't seem to match up with your claims anyways.

It's the largest in terms of number of vessels in this list.

110,NAV," Index mutual funds - yes, it’s purely NAV based. For ETFs, there’s something called the creation/redemption mechanism. If the price of the ETF grows too high relative to NAV, “authorized participants” go into the market, buy the companies the ETF owns, and exchange them for a relatively overvalued share of the ETF. The reverse happens when the ETF price is too low relative to NAV. In this way, ETF prices are kept very close to their NAV.

In both cases, billions of dollars flowing into index funds lead to fund managers blindly buying the market, which does push up asset prices.",sprrrtrns,8,/r/investing/comments/ljomtp/price_setting_for_index_fund/gnewf0r/,0.02,0.909,0.071,0.6486
111,NAV," NAV is the price according to each holding, so if the prices of holdings goes up, so does NAV.
