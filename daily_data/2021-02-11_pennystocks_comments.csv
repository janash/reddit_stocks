Both she and I lost our father's to Melanoma, so this was way too stressful for us.

Then I'm sitting here waiting for her to finish up paperwork, and I read a DD about a company that is actively trying to take away the pain and anxiety that I've felt too many times in my life AND it could make me money in the process? You bet your ass I'm in! Don't care that it's already up 10% today. Don't care if this investment loses me money (although I would much prefer it make money 🤑)

But the instances of CTCL is quite rare and is pretty much just applying a bandaid to a cut.

Oral mucositis has a wider variety of applications from cancer/radiation treatments (general) and is one that may seen as the product of this company pending results and approval

It's good that they're both in phase 3 but if they make it through the market, this should easily be a $10 stock at the very least.

84,SNGX," Looking over their drugs:

**SGX301**- This is a topical treatment for cutaneous T cell lymphoma (lymphoma in the skin).  Looks like the treatment is applied like a cream and then activated by light.   Basically a cream that will cause the skin the react violently with light.  So anything like cancer in the skin will get killed with the violent reaction.  Kind of like burning the skin but not quite as bad.  Al-Qaeda occupying a small town? Send in the army and dont worry about civilian casualties kind of treatment.   Cutaneous T cell lymphoma is pretty rare so they will probably charge a ton for it.  If FDA approved it will be the only approved option so insurance may cover it. 

**SGX942**.  Treatment for mucositis.  Chemotherapy for cancer tends to kill fast growing cells.  Cancer grows fast so it dies slightly faster than the body with chemo.  hair cells and cells lining the mouth and gut also grow fast.  So chemo can cause hair loss and really painful sores in the mouth (mucositis).  

Their treatment is a cocktails of amino acids given IV, not impressive.  But phase 2 had some positive results reducing duration of symptoms.  But this treatment is a bit like having a flame thrower pointed at your lawn and then throwing some fertilizer on it hoping it helps keep the flame thrower from killing the lawn.   I dont have high hopes for this one.  I see insurances trying to refuse coverage for this.  Expensive with only small benefits.  

**SGX201 and 203** appear to be the same medicine.  This is a topical steroid for treating Crohns and other inflammation in the bowel.   Crohns is bad inflammation in the bowel treated with steroid tablets or other other heavy duty immune drugs.  these have lots of side effects.   Something like this that would just coat the surface of the bowel and not get absorbed would reduce side effects.   The down side is that it is probably not going to be very strong.  

we do the same thing with skin conditions like psoriasis.  We start with the steroid creams but if they dont work we move on to the more powerful meds.  The same medicine, betamethasone, is already available as a skin cream. 

Crohns is a pretty severe inflammatory condition so I'm worried this treatment wont be strong enough.  But it has a sound basis for trying to see if it would work. 

I'll keep an eye on SNGX.  The treatments are a long shot for working but if approved they would fill areas with no other approved treatments.",automatedcharterer,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/lhkyf3/deep_dd_on_soligenix_sngx_read_it_first/gmyyfy2/,0.12,0.714,0.166,0.9679

93,DD," Other tips I have:

Make sure that the DD posters and commenters also actively engage in other, non-financial related subreddits. That at least increases the chance that they are real accounts, not just bots or human trolls trying to push a stock, though that does not exclude the account owner from trying to do it himself.

If they are also active on their own DD thread and answer questions and comments thats even better.

Analyze their comments and posts on if they ""sound real"". If it reads like a generic copy and paste (""I agree!"" instead of ""Your argument that X is Y is sound!"") or if there are patterns or similarities between their comments and posts then that could be an indication that they are just trying to push a stock and not actually engage with the community for real.

114,DD, As a newbie I appreciate this. Of course I joined because of all the hoopla news recently. But I also came because I want to learn more about the stock market… Of course I want to make a lot of money but at the same time I’m willing to take it easy and play the long game… Right now I feel like I’m easily swayed and I appreciate knowing that there are some people in this forum that take it seriously and don’t want people like me to get completely screwed over… I love the DD.,glendaleterrorist,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/lh49m8/a_few_tips_in_regards_to_stock_picking_and_a_note/gmw4ueq/,0.061,0.654,0.286,0.9723
115,DD," I'm still new to this sub and mostly just lurk for good DD but I just wanted to say that I REALLY appreciate this post. It makes me feel encouraged to scrutinize any incoming information very heavily which is always a good thing.

Definitely A LOT of new ""noise"" out there to filter out so a little direction from the OGs on what to look for and what to avoid is invaluable.

Final aside: I'm already up almost 10k this year, largely by some really good plays that I got pointed to here. So I just wanted to say I love you guys and thank you. Keep up the Good Work!

Otcmarkets.com you can see pennystocks that are being sold ,  up to date news by ticker + screener. Some stocks have warnings. 

Unbiastock.com shows you stocks that are trading last hour or 6-12-24.

Finviz.com is a stock screener with many filters but only non-OTC .

My stock portfolio is a free app to monitor your portfolio .

TD Ameritrade lets you buy almost any stock.  RH and Webull don't allow OTC and most pennystocks are OTC. Fidelity also good but occasionally don't offer a stock. 

I trade 4-5 stocks daily but that is cuz I'm on my phone most of the day monitoring my 64 stock portfolio and seeing what others recommend or what is selling .

The general advice for pennystocks is to trade not invest . Occasionally you find a winner that you keep and might add to. You make more money with several 20% short trades that add up over time vs chasing winners and losing money in the process. 

We all make the mistake of getting in late, or selling too early . 

I don't do what some do like deeply research a company Sec filings , balance sheet etc. 

I go to Yahoo Finance and click view all. Check 50/200 MA + Float that the smaller the better and prefer under 100M. Billions of shares in a pennystock is a warning sign. Ideally the numbers at the bottom like earnings growth,  operating income,  EBITDA should be positive but rarely the case with pennystocks or companies that are growing. 

Before a purchase I check Yahoo Finance conversations. You can see how much interest by number of new conversations.  Also good info from posters that know about the company.  Volume too is important.  Should be much higher than usual.

I also go to Stocktwits for the same .

Someone pointed out that companies that price rises 100% in last year or months will probably keep going . This is very true in pennystocks. 

But these sites + Reddit are full of pumpers and dumpers.  So read through the lines.

Finally when a stock seems a winner by the point it crosses 100% for you many recoup investment.  I wait until 220-240% so I only have to sell 30% of stocks not 50%.

But these sites + Reddit are full of pumpers and dumpers.  So read through the lines.

Finally when a stock seems a winner by the point it crosses 100% for you many recoup investment.  I wait until 220-240% so I only have to sell 30% of stocks not 50%. This threshold usually happens in one day.

176,DD," Just posting my 2 cents here as a doc. Don’t put much weight on most of these biotech companies that all of a sudden are getting into the Covid market, that have never been in the vaccine market previously. I know fibromyalgia, cancer, and gene therapy sound like a natural segue into vaccine development, but it isn’t. Also for those looking for DD, vaccines using bacterial and viral vectors for viral antígens have been studies for decades now. It’s a really cool idea,  it unfortunately there are a lot of issues with them and have not proven efficacious. 

I don’t mean to rain on your parade. Tonix may hold its weight on the other trials they have going on, but jumping on the Covid bandwagon out of the blue seems like an easy way for them to squeeze more money out of the market.",Chitown_Derp,56,/r/pennystocks/comments/lh8itm/tnxp_tonix_pharmaceutical_upcoming_milestones/gmwek2l/,0.039,0.867,0.094,0.8014

186,III," Good question. My initial thoughts on there Phase I/II results are that the immuno-response is relatively low compared to Moderna/Pfizer. I am also skeptical as they cut their study group in Phase 2 by half according to reports, which is kind of strange. Lastly, they are using a inactivated virus for the vaccine that often requires booster shots, as the immuno-response is not as strong as live attenuated vaccines and (based on the early evidences) mRNA vaccines. Then again, mRNA vaccines were just theoretical for the most part up until recently. Pretty cool stuff.

&#x200B;

Anyways, I think that Ocugen (a biotech company focusing on eye diseases) partnering up with Bharat biotech is a gamble. The FDA is unlikely to award them emergency use athorization with the current results published. If they were to prove superior efficacy with more phase III trials, they might get it. However, take into consideration that Ocugen would then have to establish distribution in the US, which I can't imagine is an overnight thing.

Any chance you could give me your opinion on what they are doing and the likelihood of them actually succeeding in the pharma sector as a weed company? 

They are currently awaiting results of a Phase 2 trial of using their medical MJ to help patients with Covid-19, should be posted very soon.

--

I bought in before this company did a reverse split and the stock crashed to the ground after the whole weed market went down as well. They decided to shift their main focus to the medical benefits for MJ.

Like you mentioned in your post, the market has been waiting to see the first quarter sales results.

Any thoughts on their morphine alternative, Olinvyk/Oliceridine?  Seems to me like it should be massive - I've heard of morphine shortages, something about Oli not causing ""respiratory depression"" or something...  Maybe something about it being less problematic from an opioid addiction perspective?

213,DD," DD from a review from budcars... pretty damning.

""

I don't like to post bad reviews, but my experience with BudCars was extremely disappointing.  First, I received a flyer in the mail that reads in a nicely highlighted star ""ALL ORDERS 20% OFF FOR NEW CUSTOMERS"" - which sounds good.  

So, I jump online and look over their products, which seem on par for cannabis delivery places in the Sacramento area, and I select two items totaling  ~$65 - not a huge order since I have not used them before and I don't know this company or their staff or whether or not they are reliable, timely, or professional - and begin the process of registering an account and placing an order.  

First problem:  It clearly states in a number of places on their website that orders over $50 get free delivery, yet when I am about to check out, the delivery fee is still included.  Not a big deal as it is only three or four dollars and I have to call anyway to pay with a card instead of cash.  **Note that everywhere on the website that it lists debit or credit card payments are available if you call, there is no information stipulating that there is a minimum amount to place an order using a card.  Not even in the fine print of their website, which I did take the time to read after all calling.

Second problem: the young woman on the phone is friendly and helpful but apologizes and tells me that the 20% only applies to minimum orders of $100 for new customers.  I look over the flyer again as I am talking to her - not only does it not say that anywhere on the flyer, is specifically says ""ALL ORDERS"" in all caps!  The only stipulation for a 20% discount is that you be a new customer, which I would have been.  No minimum order limit is listed anywhere. Also nowhere on the flyer is any information suggesting terms subject to change or expire.  This flyer is a 20% off coupon for new customers. Period.  No exclusions.  

The young woman continues to apologize offers me 10% off, tells me what a great deal it is, and when I continue to point out that there is no minimum order listed on the flyer, offers to let me speak to a manager.  A young man comes on the phone - Brian May have been his name, but I am not sure - and proceeds to tell me that flyers are costly to print and there is fine print assumed.  Then after going round a bit, he offers to give me the 20% off and he tells me what a great deal he is giving me and basically how lucky I am and if the owner were there he would have already hung up on me...

WOW.  I'm thinking to myself, one, I'm never ordering from this place again and two, do they think that everyone calling to order is some college stoner who is too high to understand how advertisement laws work or knows what professional service actually is?!  I admit, I getting pretty annoyed with this guy at this point, but I am still being polite despite my growing frustration and am STILL willing to try their business - I really do like to support local folks and as an independent contractor, appreciates the hurdles small companies have to face to ""get established.""  Maybe that's just me?  Maybe they are having a bad day at the shop?  Maybe they are just young? I can think of a lot of excuses for the lack of professionalism - none of them are really legitimate if you are running a business.

Third problem:  So, according to this gentleman, he is ever so kindly gracing me with a 20% discount and free delivery - despite those being clearly stated terms on their flyer and website.... I thank him and tell him that part of the reason I called was to pay with my card.  We are, after all, still under a Shelter in Place order and dealing with a **pandemic** and should do what we can to limit contact with each other.... including not paying for products and services with cash.  He tells me, ""oh, there's an $80 minimum for card orders.""

That's three strikes.  I pull up the BudCars website as I am talking to him and tell him that (again) no minimum orders or stipulations are listed online.  He rudely tells me that if their service isn't working out for me, maybe I should cancel my order.  We go round again, and I am still being polite and he is using polite wording, but has a rather rude tone, and finally I tell him that there is no way I would spend MORE money ordering from a place that is run so shoddily.  

Extremely disappointing!  Misleading advertising, misleading website information, and impolite management all combine to merit a one star review.    I would not give any stars, but sadly have to give at least one to leave a review.  I will also be contacting the BBB.

250,DD," This is a really good list.  The first three are pretty much identical to how I start.  

A few additional things to note, if there is no news on OTC Markets, I usually start some digging to see if there is news elsewhere.  The stuff in news is only what is reported through the market (I think it is a 6F report).  So chatter on this sub with no news on OTC piques my curiosity that I may be getting in before the catalyst.  Usually not, but I have found some awesome run ups that way.  

Two other things I look at early on - (1) how many shares are issued and what is the market cap?  (2) look at the financials and see how it is trending.  

Almost every company in the sub $1 range is going to losing money, but looking at the income statement gives me an idea of whether this is a company that is ramping up sales or spending money developing a product, etc.  I just like to make sure the financial support the narrative.  As an example, if someone is posting about how there is going to be some huge announcement about a drug therapy the company developed, I go look at the income statement and see how much money has been spent on R&D or testing to see if that story is reasonable.

Just some other ideas for a quick and dirty DD.",SnidelyWhiplash1,12,/r/pennystocks/comments/lhor6t/how_i_do_due_diligence/gmyig9p/,0.042,0.856,0.102,0.9423
251,DD," I just wanted to say thank you for this information.  I’ve only started investing a few weeks ago, but I’m only playing with money I can lose with no issue.  With that said, I like the penny stocks because the small amount of money I use allows me to obtain more shares per dollar.  I’ve been looking at lots of different DDs and have been curious on the methods by which these companies even appear on peoples’ radar. 

There’s so many stocks worth less than $1 so it can make it a bit daunting to sort through them.  I had thought about asking how to go about doing my own DD, but I’m sure that’s asked often and I didn’t want to beat a dead horse.  I definitely agree with the idea of once a DD is posted to the sub, it’s oftentimes too late.  Thus, why I’d like to know how to get ahead of the stock like they do.

256,TD," I do this all the time.

Here is what I do.

I have three broker accounts but I use two since it suits my style.

I have a isolated brokerage account for penny stocks that is separate from my main trading account because most of these will sit for a long time before they move. 

I use TD Ameritrade and Schwab. TD Ameritrade for its dope research tools and “stock hacker” feature which helps me find literally boatloads of otc tickers. Then I use Schwab’s streetsmart edge to execute the otc trades since TD Ameritrade charges $6.95 for otc tickers but Schwab its $0 which is what you want.

I have Schwab’s Streetsmart edge up on the right monitor and TD Ameritrade’s thinkorswim up in my center and left side monitor with a browser window as well on the far left.

So I run the stock hacker with filters for tickers with .000001 to .01 because why not this is for fun and then I sort by market cap.

Then I usually start at the first non zero market cap and start punching in tickers into seeking alphas premium research and otcmarkets if seeking alpha doesn’t have what I am looking for. I’ll also use Feedly to register alerts and Google alerts to give me updates on anything with the company right to my phone. If I think it’s a dead company I move on, if I think it’s got potential I put a $1 into it which gives like 11,000-1,000,000 shares depending on the share price. If I think it’s super dope and has recent small movements with news to support that and not pump and dump characteristics then I’ll throw $10-$100 in it (rare putting in $100 but I’m mostly throwing $1-$10).

Once I put cash in on a stock I’ll create an alert for it on either platform to alert me if it hits .50 cents and then .80-$1.00. That way I can go in and see what I want to do, my alerts help manage holding tons of various stocks.

This process nets me decent cash over the year and I randomly find good ones, a lot don’t do anything but sit dormant but hey I usually just lost a $1 lol it’s gambling and more fun to me than a lotto ticket even though that’s what it is.

I use penny stock earnings to fund my bigger trades but I have more fun with penny stocks especially the super low ones (.000001). It’s cool to see thousands to millions of shares for so cheap turn into like .985 or $1.23 and see you bought in at like some insanely low number at .000001 lol

Either way it’s fun to do when drunk too lol",Mr_Voltiac,6,/r/pennystocks/comments/lhor6t/how_i_do_due_diligence/gmzfo2f/,0.047,0.77,0.183,0.9968
257,DD, I always include financials in my DD.,soareyousaying,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/lhor6t/how_i_do_due_diligence/gmzja33/,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0

259,CG," For the naysayers among you, realize that this doesn't necessarily assume that your account is *only* worth $1000. Let's be conservative and decide that you want to sell *rising* stocks at 7.5% gain after at most one month. This means that $1000 of your portfolio is assumed to be in a single equity that will rise 7.5% over the course of the month, not that the total value of your portfolio starts at $1000.  


Note that not all positions will pan out; the assumption is only that you have $1000 that succeed in attaining 7.5% each period (in my example, a month). To put that in perspective, I have a play account (I call it my ""YOLO account"" as opposed to my actual retirement account) worth about $12,000 - not a negligible amount of money, but not a ton either. It grew to that size after I started actively investing in it in October. The first couple thousand grew slowly as I hedged risks and managed losses\*. Currently, however, I can diversify those $12,000 into several different equities. If I can count on just $1000 worth to give me a 7.5% return in the first month, even if the other $11k drops down to $0 (the probability of which is very low), there's more risk in my account, but I am still on track. The next month, I just need $1075 to rise 7.5%, regardless of what my other positions/securities look like. In the likely scenario that I don't lose everything but the top performer in my portfolio, I have a fair bit of padding to hedge against potential losses in the top ($1000 + 7.5%)\^1.075 % of my account.   


As a result of the current rate of growth, I have 6 equities all purchased in the last 3 weeks that have each gained at least 10%. The highest of the bunch was purchased on 2/2 and is currently up about 40%.   


Assuming that I only pick one winner for the value + capital growth of the original investment (not counting possible dividends), I would have a pre-tax $1,000,000 after about 97 months, or about 8 years and a little over a month. Capital gains taxes will do their work on this -- if my math is right, at the likely CG rates in 2021, it would take about 13.5 years to hit $1,000,000. If that seems like a long time, realize that most people invest into mutual funds in their 401(k)/403b and/or IRA for *40 years* to try to reach $1,000,000. If you can then invest that $1,000,000 into a safe income-producing fund with a 6.5% annual rate of return, you'll have a comfortable pretax income of about $65,000/year. Yes, the tax man will take his share of that. He's also taking his share of your current income, and theoretically you're investing a good portion of that money, now unnecessary. The real expense to consider (for the Americans) whether that's enough income is healthcare.  


So why don't more people do this? First, because people tend to fear losses. If $11k out of my original $12k loses money, I've added a degree of risk to my portfolio, but as I mentioned earlier, I'm still on track. Losses aren't to be feared so much as managed and leveraged. That brings me to my second point: people don't want to manage their portfolios actively. I'm lucky to have the skills to automate most of my trades, so I'm actively investing without putting a ridiculous amount of time into investing. Not everyone can do that. Stop losses and 7.5% limit sales are your friends. Finally, because for decades, investing has been treated like an alchemical superpower that only Wall Street super geniuses should engage in. ""It's better to pay someone else to handle these things"" and/or ""Do you realize how much you could lose on the stock market!?"" (I had to ease my mom's fears that she couldn't lose more than she invested when she was only buying shares. She still panic sold because she had no idea that sometimes equities are cyclical. She is absolutely terrified of managing her own finances no matter how easy it is. She's now well past retirement age and still working, unfortunately). This was basically true in the days of paper trading, and it has continued to benefit the brokers to continue perpetuating these ideas. The truth is, as everyone here knows, you can learn basic finance in a few weeks, you can have a decent grasp on fundamentals and technical analysis in a month, and you can invest and experiment for as long as you need to before starting to engage in this plan.   


Someone asked why all Wall Street folks aren't bajillionaires according to this math. The answer is simple: they have clients, and sometimes their investments lose traction. Most hedge fund managers make more money than you or I will ever even dream of, and they do it because my 13.5 years to a million dollars is their 13.5 days to a million dollars (remember that they're only taking a \~1% commission from the funds they manage). Still, if they make a $1bn bet and lose money one month, that's money out of their commission and their investors will want their assets moved into more conservative asset classes. For the hedge fund manager, it's safer to make small, steady gains overall.  


The safest strategy by far is to make sure that you are dollar-cost averaging, continuing to invest into your portfolio while you gain and lose your new capital growth. This extra money is more to invest, but it cushions your losses so that you can continue to invest the amount you wanted to even if your top gainer missed the 7.5% mark.  


By the way, I just got an alert that my top position sold at its price target. Nice! Now time to find another one.

Last revenue report was something like 75k, they are gonna slaughter that at the end of this month. Currently at about .15, looking likely to at least hit .50 but I could see it going as high as a dollar or 2.

342,MS," #STEV

Excited about this stock, a friend asked me about it, I hadn't heard of it, and I weighed in as well as got in heavy. Still under 2 cents, get in while you can. TLDR DD is they are in the business of stevia production management and consulting, the sugar substitute, and people are going to continue to focus on their health during the Rona lockdown and coming out of it, and health foods aren't going anywhere. Stevia, the product, is a household name that is here to stay.


#SNPW

I continue to be optimistic on this. In around .05-.09 depending on which batch, watched it hit .30 and could have walked away with x3-x6 money. Holding due to thinking it will be a dollar stock. Current at 0.16, great time to buy

#BCLI

I continue to be long on this. Penny stock, but $7+ shares. March will yield FDA study results for their MS study. Sort of a roulette wheel; will be great news and a big jump, or won't be good news and will be bad. Up 60% in last 3 months.

#ASTI

452,CEO," There's definitely some outstanding questions that will need answers here along the way.

Here's a couple of thoughts from my point of view:

The CEO owns 39% of MedRecycler per the article you linked. Two other groups own the remaining 10% of that 49%. This doesn't seem uncommon, especially since it's not a majority ownership.

I do not think National Mechanical Group (NMG) is the same as the plumbing service (National Mechanical Service) which is what I'm assuming you looked up. National Mechanical Group Corp is listed on the solar panel patent ([http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=10529880.PN.&OS=PN/10529880&RS=PN/10529880](http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=10529880.PN.&OS=PN/10529880&RS=PN/10529880)). I suspect this is a bit of a shell subsidiary at the moment, holding the solar panel patent and perhaps some other IP. This is also the subsidiary that is labeled to be in partnership for the Durango project ([https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/11/20/1950179/0/en/Sun-Pacific-Holding-Corp-s-Subsidiary-National-Mechanical-Group-in-Partnership-with-Blissful-Holdings-Identifies-80-Million-Project-Funding-Source-Partner-for-Solar-Farm-Project-in.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/11/20/1950179/0/en/Sun-Pacific-Holding-Corp-s-Subsidiary-National-Mechanical-Group-in-Partnership-with-Blissful-Holdings-Identifies-80-Million-Project-Funding-Source-Partner-for-Solar-Farm-Project-in.html)). Some more clarification from the company would be great here, for sure, but I wouldn't say I find it off-putting. I find it a bit more representative of a still developing company looking to find its legs.

Finding its legs will also mean getting more management in place. I think that's a good point to keep tabs on. The CEO looks to have a good amount on his plate, and he will need to establish some help at a management level within the company. I suspect (hope?) we see some positive growth in this area when more revenue pours in. This might be when MedRecycler opens, when more contracts are agreed to with bus shelters/benches/etc., or when there are contracts for the solar panels after UL certification. These are all things to keep an eye on, as they are necessary to generate revenue in order to grow.

I still think the official solar panel patents, the official Rhode Island government bond money ($17M!) slated to be released with MedRecycler opening, and the official DEM documentation on the MedRecycler trumps not having all of the answers to a few of these questions, but that's just my opinion, so I'm choosing to hold.

Of course, most of this is just my opinion with some food for thought. I certainly can't claim any of it as fact except the documentation which is on legit government websites. That much is fact. The rest is a guessing game...I guess that's why it's an OTC and not on NASDAQ (yet? LOL).

The CEO owns 39% of MedRecycler per the article you linked. Two other groups own the remaining 10% of that 49%. This doesn't seem uncommon, especially since it's not a majority ownership.

I do not think National Mechanical Group (NMG) is the same as the plumbing service (National Mechanical Service) which is what I'm assuming you looked up. National Mechanical Group Corp is listed on the solar panel patent ([http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=10529880.PN.&OS=PN/10529880&RS=PN/10529880](http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=10529880.PN.&OS=PN/10529880&RS=PN/10529880)).

This is also the subsidiary that is labeled to be in partnership for the Durango project ([https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/11/20/1950179/0/en/Sun-Pacific-Holding-Corp-s-Subsidiary-National-Mechanical-Group-in-Partnership-with-Blissful-Holdings-Identifies-80-Million-Project-Funding-Source-Partner-for-Solar-Farm-Project-in.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/11/20/1950179/0/en/Sun-Pacific-Holding-Corp-s-Subsidiary-National-Mechanical-Group-in-Partnership-with-Blissful-Holdings-Identifies-80-Million-Project-Funding-Source-Partner-for-Solar-Farm-Project-in.html)). Some more clarification from the company would be great here, for sure, but I wouldn't say I find it off-putting. I find it a bit more representative of a still developing company looking to find its legs.

Finding its legs will also mean getting more management in place. I think that's a good point to keep tabs on. The CEO looks to have a good amount on his plate, and he will need to establish some help at a management level within the company. I suspect (hope?) we see some positive growth in this area when more revenue pours in. This might be when MedRecycler opens, when more contracts are agreed to with bus shelters/benches/etc., or when there are contracts for the solar panels after UL certification. These are all things to keep an eye on, as they are necessary to generate revenue in order to grow.

I still think the official solar panel patents, the official Rhode Island government bond money ($17M!) slated to be released with MedRecycler opening, and the official DEM documentation on the MedRecycler trumps not having all of the answers to a few of these questions, but that's just my opinion, so I'm choosing to hold.

Of course, most of this is just my opinion with some food for thought. I certainly can't claim any of it as fact except the documentation which is on legit government websites. That much is fact. The rest is a guessing game...I guess that's why it's an OTC and not on NASDAQ (yet? LOL).

458,CEO," I am wondering if you had a chance to attend or listen to the West Warwick planning board meeting January 12, 2021.

If you did, then you would know that the day the Medrecycler facility is approved a 17 million dollar RI bond will be released to SNPW,

It is important to note those bonds are all ready spoken for by ONE Investor, there is no public money involved.

Let's address the board.

Yes, management is basically one individual (so was Tesla, that seems to be working out)).

What this one individual has been able to accomplish:

- was able to file several patents and have them approved for a non glass solar panels

- had the ability to raise enough cash to pay for R&D, design, purchasing of equipment, and all legal work to have Medrecyler ready to go on line

- able to negotiate 5 to 10 year contracts with Cities in at least 3 states for SNPW's outdoor advertising solar powered bus shelters and trash bin.

- formed a partnership with a Mexican company to co-built the Durango Mexican Solar Farm.

Let's address The unnamed subsidiary

While National Mechanical Group Corp' was a plumbing business, how difficult do you think it is for the company to hire solar panel installer experts and retrain train their employees from installing massive boilers to installing solar panels?

Let's address why be in SNPW now

- Biden is president

- Biden is the climate change green energy and environmental president

- Gina M. Raimondo, former Governor of RI is the new Sec of Commence

- Raimondo shares a table with Pres Biden

- SNPW's CEO and Raimondo are friends

- When Biden killed the Keystone pipeline day one he promised those that lost high paying fossil fuel jobs will have new high paying jobs in government supported green energy jobs such as solar.

464,CEO," I posted on the other ""DD"" post for this company - one of their ""projects"" the MedRecycler facility is here in RI (other side of the state from me).   In reading their filings, they are basically hinging the company's success on the completion of this project and if it doesn't go forward, they are bankrupt (their own words in the 8-K or 10-K, can't remember which one it was).

Being from RI, I can tell you there is considerable opposition to the project and the CEO was recently connected to an attempted fraud for $45m in covid masks that caused the town council in West Warwick to sour on the project.  I've seen RIDEM is still moving forward with the permitting process, but in a state like RI, all you need is a vocal few to kill something that is controversial.

So lets clear up your points one by one, as I'm honestly not sure whether you're just dealing emotionally or intentionally ramping. So let's be rational. 

1. Comparing this to Tesla does not only stink of ramping its also RIDICULOUSLY farfetched, I would even go as far as to call it a lie. Tesla was not initially built on Musk, he was not always the CEO, and he was not, nor was there ever, a board of one. This is just plain dumb. 
2. 'how hard is it to retrain plumbers as electrical engineers' Very hard, the skillset between plumbing and electrical engineering of this kind are worlds apart. You'd need, at the very least, skilled and trained electricians. These people are not cheap and retraining is absolutely not on the cards. You're talking years of training here. As I said before, I have family members who are solar engineers so I know exactly how long it takes. Helps you out a lot if you don't make absurd assumptions about industries you know nothing about
3. Your ONLY potentially valid point is the FORMER Governor of RI having the ear of the president. And even then, it's a big if. It's not a given that that GR will grant contracts to this company on the basis they have a deal with RI, they'll have that deal regardless. 
   1. Cronyism is a much more compelling argument that you make in saying the CEO and GR are friends. But still, no guarantees and it doesn't make it a viable business. 
4. MedCycle NEEDS a 17.2m injection in order to fund MedRecycler.

There was a bill in 2019 ([http://webserver.rilin.state.ri.us/billtext19/housetext19/h5448.htm](http://webserver.rilin.state.ri.us/billtext19/housetext19/h5448.htm)) that came up on both the house and senate side that stalled (senate moved to establish a commission to study - which really means ""DOA"" but we want people to think there is a chance).

Rhode Island is not like anywhere else and you cannot reason with the extreme ""progressives"" on things like this.  The only hope this facility has IMO is that the extremists do some research or they want to horse trade something else they value more (like maybe $15 min wage) for support on this.",Objective_Kitchen_94,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/lhi78p/sun_pacific_snpw_a_word_of_caution/gmyq81z/,0.052,0.863,0.085,0.7407

489,ABEV," No worries. I started trying out trading actively like 2 years ago, wound up losing like 50% of my portfolio the first year because I expected the COVID crash to double-bottom and didn't set real stop-losses on leveraged short ETFs. Was a painful experience, but since July I'm up 200%. Now I'm sitting 1/2 in cash and about 1/3 in fairly boring plays like Subaru (FUJFY), Airbus (EADSY), and ABEV because their valuations are reasonable and they should benefit from COVID rebounds.   


First lesson: valuation matters no matter what people say - learn basic fundamentals analysis - Debt/Equity ratio, Price/Sales estimates, etc.  and compare them with the sector/industry. Same with insider buying and learning what different kinds of equity offerings indicate.  
\- For where to look for info on these things, Roaring Kitty/DFV has an excellent video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2CBcthRVKE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2CBcthRVKE) 

Second Lesson: stay away from leveraged products until you know what you are doing, and stay away from leveraged short etfs, period.   


Third Lesson: Have a stop-loss or trailing stop-loss set. If the stock is high-volatility, some brokers won't allow that, so you have to stick to your mental exists. This is where learning about support/resistance, trend analysis, and technical indicators are important.   
\- If you don't mind reading, this book is an outstanding way to learn technical analysis, especially the first half: [https://smile.amazon.com/Technical-Analysis-Financial-Markets-Comprehensive/dp/0735200661/ref=sr\_1\_2?dchild=1&keywords=technical+analysis&qid=1613073238&sr=8-2](https://smile.amazon.com/Technical-Analysis-Financial-Markets-Comprehensive/dp/0735200661/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=technical+analysis&qid=1613073238&sr=8-2)   


Final Lesson: pay attention to market sector performance and look for good opportunities in underperforming sectors that are primed for a rebound. This isn't perfect, but it's a good guideline.",Delavan1185,2,/r/pennystocks/comments/lhq9if/everything_is_fine_i_think_sweats_profusely/gmz5wt2/,0.079,0.773,0.148,0.9704

There is no real data or information about this company and anything concrete that comes up points toward it being a scam trying to take advantage of market trends(CBD & psilocybin). Looking through the history of their Twitter posts is more than enough to be extremely wary(Check back 2-3 years and look at replies from past shareholders.) 

I have no issue with being wrong about this, but someone please help me see what I'm missing here. The CEO doesn't even have a LinkedIn.

EDIT: We are also being downvoted but no one will engage, so yet another sign that this is a: pump and dump scam.",thanasip,2,/r/pennystocks/comments/lhd5mc/minerco_inc_mine_full_indepth_dd/gmz4igy/,0.18,0.74,0.08,-0.9001
504,REAL," Go through their Twitter history, it is the SAME company that sold beverages a few years ago. They have NOT just adopted the ticket symbol. They posted a video of a random plot in Jamaica, without an address and their posts in general are of low quality and very shady. 

Where do we hear these zoom calls you are referring to? The content on their website is changing frequently. I think it is you who needs to post some proof. 

I made a 700% return on this stock just by pure luck, but I wouldn't advise anyone to open a position worth more then what they can afford to lose in a day. I only started researching it in depth when it jumped up in recent days even though there has been no news.  

This will probably get down voted because people don't want to hear it, but go look through replies on their Twitter from a few of years ago.

512,DD," It was described in a previous DD. Basically biotech can have an ebb and flow to it. Investors got excited about it early on, then it fizzled out. Now they have re-gained interest from investors again years later. Sounds like they are making good progress in their clinicals (if I am understanding everything correctly) and are small enough to be bought out to my understanding.  


Biotech's can't really make earnings until their product is released so until then, they kinda revolve around hype and testing results (once again to my understanding). One bit of good news, is that I read somewhere they have enough funding for their current clinicals to carry them to 2023, so they should be safe for the short and relatively long plays.",gamefreak054,3,/r/pennystocks/comments/lho9ud/agtc_earnings_update_and_takeoff_from_penny_land/gmz111b/,0.0,0.843,0.157,0.9607

It is definitely concerning to me that J&J is in a similar place with their clinical study on XLRP (and of course more funding and stronger pipeline etc.).

However, my initial thoughts are while yes J&J has a pipeline for a similar therapy, Gene therapy is one of the fastest growing industries in 2020, AGTC is involved in more than XLRP and there should be room for other players when it's all said and done.

I by no means suggest that ACB is overvalued. On the contrary if you put this into perspective of tech stocks it is conservative. Or I won’t use the “T” word here in case I geT into Trouble. 

On the contrary I am saying that FIRE is significantly undervalued, in a huge way if their revenue forecast is anything to go by. Looking at it in simplistic terms it would take FIRE 16.373 years to pay its market cap from its revenues. This is only the beginning of a massive economy which will begin to go global in the coming years. Once this happens it’s established and profitable companies that will come out on top. 

ACB would take 52.276 years based on this forecast. To be fair to ACB this is not bad based on their size. If they can get down operating costs and scalability perfected then they will increase their profits exponentially and I would still say is a very good long term cannabis play. 

But I like pennies. And FIRE is a very hot penny stock rn that won’t stay in this forum for long. 🔥 🌱 

Also it is this stage of a market that is flooded with companies trying to establish themselves. The larger the size can sometimes be the downfall. Issues in manufacturing, quality control, contracts pending governmental approval. All of these factors can be serious hurdles for a company in this market. Going from black to white doesn’t, and can’t happen overnight. As a result the supply chain and distribution chain is still not close to the pharmaceutical industry proper. 

So approach with caution folks. We all know what happens when you play with fire... You get burned

2.) stock goes above 3 before then. I exercise the contract thus buying Xspa at the strike price even if the market price is higher. After buying, I could sell the stock at market for profit or go long and hold

Otcmarkets.com you can see pennystocks that are being sold ,  up to date news by ticker + screener. Some stocks have warnings. 

Unbiastock.com shows you stocks that are trading last hour or 6-12-24.

Finviz.com is a stock screener with many filters but only non-OTC .

My stock portfolio is a free app to monitor your portfolio .

TD Ameritrade lets you buy almost any stock.  RH and Webull don't allow OTC and most pennystocks are OTC. Fidelity also good but occasionally don't offer a stock. 

I trade 4-5 stocks daily but that is cuz I'm on my phone most of the day monitoring my 64 stock portfolio and seeing what others recommend or what is selling .

The general advice for pennystocks is to trade not invest . Occasionally you find a winner that you keep and might add to. You make more money with several 20% short trades that add up over time vs chasing winners and losing money in the process. 

We all make the mistake of getting in late, or selling too early . 

I don't do what some do like deeply research a company Sec filings , balance sheet etc. 

I go to Yahoo Finance and click view all. Check 50/200 MA + Float that the smaller the better and prefer under 100M. Billions of shares in a pennystock is a warning sign. Ideally the numbers at the bottom like earnings growth,  operating income,  EBITDA should be positive but rarely the case with pennystocks or companies that are growing. 

Before a purchase I check Yahoo Finance conversations. You can see how much interest by number of new conversations.  Also good info from posters that know about the company.  Volume too is important.  Should be much higher than usual.

I also go to Stocktwits for the same .

Someone pointed out that companies that price rises 100% in last year or months will probably keep going . This is very true in pennystocks. 

But these sites + Reddit are full of pumpers and dumpers.  So read through the lines.

Finally when a stock seems a winner by the point it crosses 100% for you many recoup investment.  I wait until 220-240% so I only have to sell 30% of stocks not 50%.

679,CBD," Delta 8 THC is a cannabinoid naturally present in very low amounts in cannabis plants (both hemp and psychoactive). However, with some light chemistry (acids and things I don't quite understand) you can synthesize D8 THC from CBD. Neat part is that, since it is derived entirely from hemp, it is legal under the Farm Bill that passed in 2018. That is to say, you can order and have D8 THC shipped in most every state in the union legally. It supposedly will not intoxicate you quite as much as Delta 9 but, speaking personally, not only would I not be able to tell much of a difference in a blind test but I actually prefer D8 carts to D9 carts.

680,THC," Delta 8 THC is a cannabinoid naturally present in very low amounts in cannabis plants (both hemp and psychoactive). However, with some light chemistry (acids and things I don't quite understand) you can synthesize D8 THC from CBD. Neat part is that, since it is derived entirely from hemp, it is legal under the Farm Bill that passed in 2018. That is to say, you can order and have D8 THC shipped in most every state in the union legally. It supposedly will not intoxicate you quite as much as Delta 9 but, speaking personally, not only would I not be able to tell much of a difference in a blind test but I actually prefer D8 carts to D9 carts.

705,DD," Recommending a lotto/custodian play: PFWIQ (currently sits at $.0029)

PFWIQ is a company that's being taken out of bankruptcy by a custodian. It's currently being cleaned up and is likely to be sold to another owner so they can then reverse merger it and become a new company. Think TSNP and its insane Nov-Feb run.

Some things to note is that it's early on in [a process that requires lots of patience](https://old.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/leu7pd/penny_stocks_under_01_to_buy_this_week/gmjja5x/?context=3). The custodian is still in court trying to take the Q off the ticker, and then afterwards has to find a buyer. To reach the end is a several months play. Not to mention, this play could totally fail.

However, the custodian is the King of OTC SPACs/custodian plays: David Lazar (google David Lazar InvestorsHub for a compilation page + extra DD of his tickers - automod always deletes my post when I link to there). 

He's got a great track record of finding diamonds in the rough that turn into great investments. One great recent example is XMET where it's run from $.0009 to $.02 in less than two months, and the new owner hasn't even announced what the new company will be. Still has a lot left to go tbh.

If you're a patient investor or trader, give PFWIQ a chance. It could turn into a lotto ticker or at the very least a nice runner of a trade (when it reaches a new step in the process) considering David Lazar's name recognition among reverse merger/OTC SPAC players.

724,CEO," > registered agent by the name of Riley Park based in Colorado

That is just someone that works (or worked) for https://www.registeredagentsinc.com. They offer incorporation services, which Cocannco clearly used: https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1791146/000107878219000875/f1aoffering_2b1.htm

Don Bosch was the Cocannco CEO from that point:
https://sec.report/Document/0000000000-19-015340/filename1.pdf

According to their website, Rich Thomas is now the CEO: https://www.cocannco.com/investor-relations/leadership/

The only conclusion to draw here is that whoever owns IMAGEXPRES now is utilizing the services of Registered Agents Inc. Cocannco also utilized their services. Registered Agents Inc has branches in 4 states and claims ""We also help tens of thousands of small business owners"".

EDIT: The current ImageXpres owner almost certainly isn't the old CEO or CFO though, because they [agreed to never serve as officers or directors of any publicly traded company in their settlement with the SEC](https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/money/business/2013/10/10/fairport-men-pay-75000-to-settle-fraud-allegations/2961083/) in 2013.",CarrollPete,5,/r/pennystocks/comments/lh5fjo/daily_triple_zerolotto_plays_021121/gmwma9s/,0.0,0.92,0.08,0.8781

From a drone delivery perspective they already face competition in the US, Europe, etc.  There are huge players like UPS, FedEx, Amazon, Google and smaller outfits as well all competing in this space just not in Canada.  Many of those listed already have or are working the Part 135 FAA cert they need to operate in the US and have drones going through type certification. To my knowledge DDC does not.  And anyone who says theyll expand into air taxis doesn't understand the Urban Air Mobility market.  To type certify a vehicle to carry 4 passengers like an air taxi you'd be looking at around $1B USD.    Look at the money Joby and Archer have raised and they still need more .

735,KTOS," ALPP? There are a lot of businesses who have got their foot in various sectors of the drone world.

One example is KTOS who specialise in security and defence.  They are not a penny stock, but they are solid, and to move a company like that out the way will take a lot more than a rising share price.

I own shares in the three companies and will probably invest in more new start ups, if they have a solid plan.  They will (or should) have their own niche for a specific market.",HotdogMcDraw,3,/r/pennystocks/comments/lht8yp/takof_drone_delivery_canada_about_to_takeoff/gmzbp2a/,0.0,0.83,0.17,0.9177

**UPDATE** SOME MORE INFO ON RF FILTERS...The proliferation of 4G LTE networks, the deployment of new 5G networks, and the pervasive nature of Wi-Fi are driving a dramatic increase in the number of RF bands that smartphones and other mobile devices must support. And with the coming of IoT, those bands will be more congested than ever! Each band must be isolated using filters to avoid interference that will drain battery life, reduce data speeds, and cause dropped calls. RF filters are nothing new, and have been a part of mobile devices since their creation with 1G phones and those old wireless handsets we had at home before the advent of cellular tech!

 &nbsp;

What makes this unique is that 5G needs to be even more isolated from other bands to ensure signal reliability and strength. $RESN is at the forefront of this tech for 5G.

847,CTRM," Here's why I'm sus of this stock. For one, I'm always sus if I go to their website's homepage and the *first* thing I see is their stock symbol and/or stock price. That isn't necessarily a dealbreaker for me, but it makes me a little skeptical. I'd rather a company's webpage immediately point me to their product instead of their stock price.

Another thing is that their mobile website also seems to be spotty for me. Sometimes it works, but sometimes it doesn't. It seems like I can't always click on the thing I want to click, but that could just be my wifi or my phone. It's also not the end all be all of a company.

The biggest red flag to me is that [they literally only have 1 official full time employee](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CTRM/profile/) working for them, according to their records. While this could just mean that they use contractors for everything, that still seems pretty weird to me.

This stock is super sketchy to me and I remember seeing it at $0.40 or so and thinking that people should sell now. But clearly my analysis didn't mean shit because that stock continues to rise and they continue to buy more ships. I have no idea who is going to drive those ships, but they have them and the stock keeps going up.

So maybe do the exact opposite of what I'm doing.",crastle,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/lhosje/ctrm_is_set_to_make_some_gain/gmz1yer/,0.043,0.881,0.076,0.8783

Otcmarkets.com you can see pennystocks that are being sold ,  up to date news by ticker + screener. Some stocks have warnings. 

Unbiastock.com shows you stocks that are trading last hour or 6-12-24.

Finviz.com is a stock screener with many filters but only non-OTC .

My stock portfolio is a free app to monitor your portfolio .

TD Ameritrade lets you buy almost any stock.  RH and Webull don't allow OTC and most pennystocks are OTC. Fidelity also good but occasionally don't offer a stock. 

I trade 4-5 stocks daily but that is cuz I'm on my phone most of the day monitoring my 64 stock portfolio and seeing what others recommend or what is selling .

The general advice for pennystocks is to trade not invest . Occasionally you find a winner that you keep and might add to. You make more money with several 20% short trades that add up over time vs chasing winners and losing money in the process. 

We all make the mistake of getting in late, or selling too early . 

I don't do what some do like deeply research a company Sec filings , balance sheet etc. 

I go to Yahoo Finance and click view all. Check 50/200 MA + Float that the smaller the better and prefer under 100M. Billions of shares in a pennystock is a warning sign. Ideally the numbers at the bottom like earnings growth,  operating income,  EBITDA should be positive but rarely the case with pennystocks or companies that are growing. 

Before a purchase I check Yahoo Finance conversations. You can see how much interest by number of new conversations.  Also good info from posters that know about the company.  Volume too is important.  Should be much higher than usual.

I also go to Stocktwits for the same .

Someone pointed out that companies that price rises 100% in last year or months will probably keep going . This is very true in pennystocks. 

But these sites + Reddit are full of pumpers and dumpers.  So read through the lines.

Finally when a stock seems a winner by the point it crosses 100% for you many recoup investment.  I wait until 220-240% so I only have to sell 30% of stocks not 50%.

> If they're going to ship vehicles this year, where's the prototype? 

According to their website:

*The ReVolt Electric Motorcycle has been developed through multiple pilot phases.  An industrial engineering firm is currently designing the manufacturing capacity to mass produce the ReVolt Electric Motorcycle.*

That's it. That's the whole sum of information about their electric motorcycle. Two sentences. Zero tangible information.

> Where's the factory? 

Non-existent/unknown.

> How many workers have they hired? 

Zero/unknown.

> How are they distributing the motorcycles after they get built? 

They're not building any motorcycles. You may as well be asking how they're going to mine dog farts from the moons of Saturn. It's just as likely as them building an actual motorcycle.

> What does any of this have to do with crypto?

Nothing/unknown. They've also, as of September 2020, added that their magical electric motorcycle that will totally be built and run on lithium-alternative batteries will be made out of hemp. Not joking: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alyi-electric-vehicle-design-embraces-182100446.html

This operation was performed on February 4th, 2021 by Dr. Chatchawarl Sarntipiphat, orthopedic surgeon at the Srinagarind University Hospital in the Thai province of Khon Kaen, successfully performed this on an 11-year-old patient with idiopathic scoliosis. Doctor Sarntiphat specifies the context of this operation: ""This type of scoliosis requires corrective surgical treatment because the permanent deviation of the spine can quickly lead to deformation of the vertebral bodies, especially during the child's growth phase. Particularly indicated for this type The patented Mont Blanc Spineway's 3D + implant significantly corrects deformation while maintaining the natural curves of the spine. "" Spineway has been present in Thailand through exclusive sales since 2016 and is expanding its know-how on the Asian continent with the establishment of a national distribution agreement within the main health centers in Malaysia a few months after the signing of an exclusive trade agreement for the sale of its products in Japan. With this presence in the region, Spineway and its partner will present the entire product portfolio to the principal surgeons and in particular the solutions for minimally invasive surgery Mont-Blanc MIS. Stéphane Le Roux, CEO of Spineway, said: ""We are excited about this partnership in Malaysia, a country recognized as one of the best healthcare systems in Asia. Our Mont-Blanc MIS range and the MISTI platform developed by Spineway make it possible Doctors and patients who can benefit from advanced surgical techniques thanks to unique properties that make surgical intervention more efficient. "" Sales are expected to begin in June 2021 after an agreement was reached to market Spineway products with the Malaysian regulator, the Medical Device Authority (MDA). With this first installation of the Mont Blanc 3D + implant in Thailand and this new distribution agreement in Malaysia, Spineway continues its development in Asia thanks to the high added value of its technologies.

937,DOC," All of those are pulling back right now. I think there is a lot of opportunity on the pot and mushroom stocks but with the last couple weeks the pull back was inevitable. RHT has an advantage over their competition in that their system is approved by Medicaid and Medicare. All the competition has to go though private insurers. Reason is pretty simple, their price is better and expenses cheaper. I am holding 53k shares and trying to get more. Just not sure what I want to sell to get them..... LOL.... First world problems..

I mentioned DOC.v/DOCRF, SHG.v/SHGFF, TRIP.cn/TRUFF, CBDT.cn/EPWCT to highlight the change from when the promo company was hired verses current prices. I wouldn't recommend any of them as they have already popped IMO. RHT having contracted Wall Street Reporter today should have a good couple months ahead of them if they have the following they seem to. I believed in this company for quite a while now and haven't been disappointed. I am looking forward to seeing some of my goals for this company to happen a bit sooner now.

941,ABC," Stop losses are a security measurement usually used on risky picks. Let's say you set a stop loss at -5% or -10% and it goes downwards. Your position gets closed and you are sad because you liked the stock. Now it goes further down to -20 or even -30%. Yesterday that happened to a lot of stocks. It prevented you from being down that much, but at the same time if you really like the stock, you can now get in again but for the same money but with more shares.

Let's make an example. You put 100$ into stock ABC which is worth 1$, so 100 shares. It goes down by 10% to 0.9$ and your stop loss kicks in. You get notified and lost 10$. You check the stock and see it goes further down, now it's at -30%. If you use the same 90$ that you initially had invested, you can now buy 128 shares. So now you increased your shares by 28% thanks to the stop loss.

This is of course a more extreme but not uncommon example.

Let's go even further. We talk about penny stocks and reality is pump & dumps co-exist with them. Not every increase is a pump & dump, but rarely is there an increase without one. The reason is simple: If a stock goes naturally up thanks to good news, it's easy to promote the stock for the investor to his audience, just like here on Reddit. People associate the climb purely with positive news because we have no set value behind the good news. You buy in because you like the stock and it goes down a lot as the dump happens.

But stop losses are not meant to deal with volatility (but can be used, see first example), but more to prevent heavy losses.

I will use an example of a stock I am in. CLWD was once a 18$ stock due to pump & dump from the company. Yes, the company itself. That is long ago and the people are convicted and out of the company, but point is it was there. You know where it was this beginning year? 0.0065. And along the way since I am in on it I got to know a dude that is holding CLWD shares at 16.8$. Let that sink in. In the beginning of the year, he was down  to 0.038% of his initial investment, and the worst part is if it goes up again he won't profit. At best, if ever, and it goes beyond 16.8$, he will make minimal profit, while others that got in on 0.1$, 0.05$ or heck even 0.0065$ look at 10000% profit.

Currently the market is rather forgiving and more towards ""stock goes up, stock goes down"", as in it constantly re-bounces often. And overall the stock market has a trend of going up a lot. But especially in options, leverage and for that regard penny stocks the high volatility can be used to minimize losses and maximize profits by using tools like trailing stop, stop losses, stop limits at the right time. The right time is really hard to determine and volume speaks a lot there, but also market sentiment.",oodex,3,/r/pennystocks/comments/lhfv4z/and_some_tips_from_my_side_too/gmx8alk/,0.146,0.722,0.132,-0.6147
