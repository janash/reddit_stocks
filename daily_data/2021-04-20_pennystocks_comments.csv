A lot of the information you see in these top level DDs is almost always already priced in. Everyone that owns this stock knows about coming earnings calls. That catalyst is likely priced in - much like it was recently with 88 energy. 

It doesn't take much to go from undervalued and overvalued with penny stocks. You only need a few investors with a few million to make the price of a penny stock overvalued.  

The information in a DD can be identical but at one entry point it's amazing and a week later it's a terrible buy.

26,LNG," I don't understand the competitive advantage of Driftwood LNG.  There are already a number of LNG facilities in that area.  There is Sabine Pass, Cheniere, Golden Pass, and Cameron already in that neck of the woods.  And those are just the ones that I personally know of.  What good does adding an additional facility do when it is going to compete with the existing players and offers no inherent economic advantage over those other players or puts the product any closer to the major markets?

If you want to watch for an LNG play, watch the race to get a major terminal on the west coast of the US.  Pembina looks like the leader right now to get a pipeline and major terminal that will be able to export to Asian markets out of Coos Bay in Southern Oregon.  It isn't a penny stock, but if you are wanting to try to track down potential big winners in the future LNG market... I think the better money play is Pembina ($PBA).  

Another game changer would be if they could complete an LNG pipeline to bring gas down from the Alaskan North Slope and export that out of Nikiski (a little south of Anchorage).  If that pipeline could be completed, the emerging main players if that deal comes together would be a good place to invest.

28,IMO," IMO, it's going to shoot up only if:

1. the market currently massively undervalues them. I believe it's the latest tendency to project insane 10 years ahead, so if everything goes as the market sees it, they won't shoot up. Their drilling is most likely already included in the price.
2. they're way, way more lucky than everyone's projection. Say, they find more customers than projected, expand at a crazy pace, technology allows better compression etc.

What worries me also - and I'm taking word for word here, didn't look at financials - if they paid out all their debt, that's a worrying sign. Are they gonna expand solely on cash? Isn't it norm to be in debt when you're sure the business is sustainable and will continue to grow, and use the debt to grow? Am I missing something?

29,LNG," Fair concerns. The business model is to acquire equity partners (likely overseas companies that sell nat gas). In exchange for the upfront cost commitments to build the driftwood facility (which already has all approvals), the equity partner will get LNG at cost and an equity stake.
