That’s the issue with these stocks boards: you have to be able to sift through the garbage because there are a few intelligent DDs in there. But the average person has no conviction in their plays and their actions are dictated by emotion. FOMO in at ATH and panic sell at the smallest correction

I think ARK funds are a perfect example of this. Without mentioning my opinion on the funds, notice how quickly sentiment changed.

Random price targets ($100 by x date with nothing to back it) is another one. Information/rumors without sources or with random sources like a single reddit comment too.

181,CO," To use your example, CO has a 2.9% tax on alcohol and marijuana. However, they have an extra tax on recreational marijuana of 15%. So a total of 17.9 (nearly 18%) tax on marijuana. 

If I can buy a few buds for $23.58 dollars at a store but only $20 from my dealer, it might not be worth going to the store. Every 6th purchase is free from a dealer at that point. If one smokes pretty regularly that could be a difference of a few hundred bucks over a year. That's a lot of extra doobies. 

Now, as for beer, yeah, I can brew my own, but I know it will take a lot of time and effort. Therefore, if I knew a guy who made his own beer in large quantities and I didn't have to pay any taxes on it like 18% (and I liked the beer), then I think I would probably just keep going to him instead of buying from a store. A 3% tax is still there, but negligible.

Despite what you believe, they are not the same quality either. Go compare. Ask your grower for a strain a dispensary carries. Look at them. Compare them.

Does your grower even grow legal quality? Ever ask him how it works? They sell the biggest best buds to dispensaries, the shake and little buds go to the dealers. It is how they maintain their higher **tested** values of THC.

271,GME," It’s pretty much like; if you bought all your shares on credit, and you somehow got close to becoming a liability to the lender... (the shares increased in value, you didn’t have the money to cover what you borrowed, etc.) then the lender does a margin call which essentially asks you to cover what you borrowed by paying cash or liquidating your other assets to free up the cash. 

I think I said that okay. Smooth brain here just trying to help.

Oh and the margin % is the amount of money they require you have in the account in relation to the amt that security costs. So with GME if the margin % is 100, you’d have to have the same amount of cash in your account as the amount you’re borrowing to purchase the stock.",Praytell_Tryme,4,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mv50nw/amc_gme_100300_margin_at_schwab_for_wed_421_amc/gvb57zy/,0.012,0.792,0.196,0.9732
272,DD,"  A margin call happens if the value of a margin account falls below a broker's required limit. If a HF has a fuck ton of shorts positions, and they lose enough money to exceed their margin limit, they get margin called, meaning that they need to either deposit enough money into their account(s) or sell off other assets to bring their account value(s) above their broker's limit.

Now, regardless of your opinions on the DD behind stocks like GME, assume some asset is being repeatedly shorted by a HF; the longer they play out that strategy, the more positions they're required to sell off to keep their account from getting margin called. If they do get margin called, they can be forced to sell off any other assets they have until they meet their margin limit.

If a HF runs out of assets to liquidate and doesn't have enough cash to cover their shorts, someone has to step in to cover the positions for them. The negative beta of GME is thought to be because entities short on GME are being forced to sell off a ton of assets to prevent them from getting margin called.

BB does a lot of work with IoT, but it's honestly not some domineering market leader in this field. It has cybersecurity products - but again, it's no market leader.

A comparable company making security products in the same exact category (IoT, event management, UEM) is Cisco. Cisco trades at 4.67 P/S vs BBs 5.42 P/S.

BB revenue and profit is dropping, not to mention stripping and selling away assets will reduce licensing revenue (big revenue driver for BB), for short term capital.

The one unique brightspot in BBs product porfolio is QNX Neutrino, but you're expecting too benefit from it imo. Total BB revenue from software/services (like QNX) for 2020 was less than $700mn - total number of cars that use QNX is 175mn - therefore the **most** money BB can make from QNX per car is less than $4 per year.

344,BB," It has a $700mn cash on hand, and $700mn in long-term debt.

[https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/BB/blackberry/cash-on-hand](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/BB/blackberry/cash-on-hand)

BB patents were worth roughly $2.5bn in 2019, but plenty have already been sold off and would have already contributed to the $700mn cash.

[https://seekingalpha.com/article/4302309-blackberry-real-story-is-in-patents](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4302309-blackberry-real-story-is-in-patents)

[https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/blackberry-sells-smartphone-patents-to-huawei](https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/blackberry-sells-smartphone-patents-to-huawei)

So I'd argue that a $2bn valued patent portfolio is probably overestimating. Not to mention around $350mn in revenue in 2020 came from those patents, so selling off patents brings revenue down to like $600mn.

[https://businessquant.com/blackberry-revenue-by-segment](https://businessquant.com/blackberry-revenue-by-segment)

So at best you're probably looking at a company with around $1.5bn on hand after debt and after sales of patents, with reduced revenues.

I can't find any reliable data for a 68% EV market share? But you're certainly overestimating QNX revenue growth. Total revenue for software (like QNX) was less than $700mn dollars in 2020 - with 175mn cars using it, BB literally must be making under $4 per car per year. Not a huge revenue driver. Not to mention most car companies use multiple operating systems, including android and linux. Who's to say google won't just invest heavily into android to beat out the market?

Spark isn't anything impressive. A comparable company making security products in the same exact category (IoT, event management, UEM) is Cisco. Cisco trades at 4.67 P/S vs BBs 5.42 P/S. Not to mention if you're actually talking cybersec, BB isn't a significant player at all.

Blackberry IVY could be interesting, but without seeing it in action we have no idea how well the software will work - AWS partners with loads of companies and provides cloud services/machine learning services to loads of companies. And it's slightly worrying that they're using AWS IoT tech rather than relying on BB IoT tech.

Revenue is decreasing, profits are decreasing. It's not this hugely undervalued tech company. It's up like 30% from pre-january spike, up 100% from April 2020. At best a very long term play hoping that Ivy / QNX can be monetised better - looking at a 5 - 10 year timeline.

Assuming a revenue of 600mn after patents sold, the company would trade at a valuation of 5 x its revenue. Lets take their partner for BB IVY, Amazon for a comparison.

[https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AMZN/amazon/revenue](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AMZN/amazon/revenue)

Adding cash on hand + taking away long term debt (same as what we did with BB) Amazon is worth $1.75tn. Revenue of $386bn. Therefore trades at 4.5 x revenue after add cash + taking away debt. Do you seriously think BB should be trading at **significantly** higher multiples than Amazon? Even though BB is a business with declining revenue, doesn't make a profit and is fireselling revenue-generating assets? What sort of logic is that?

Not to mention - licensing is actually where revenue growth has been driven. BB has two segments for revenue, software & services and licensing. Q1 2020 licensing revenue was 79mn, software was 168mn. Q1 2021? 108mn for licensing and 151mn for software.

Even Sena have partnered with helmet makers to get models built with or for their equipment.

Going on sentiment, the only thing I'd say you shouldn't overlook is the professional use of GoPros. They're used a lot more than one might think in filming movies, TV shows, documentaries, commercials, real estate tours, and even in academia.

927,RKT," Your broker should provide a 1099 that reports the gains and losses after the year is over. Assuming all the stocks were bought within the last few years they should show on Box A or D which as long as you don't have wash sales can be reported in summary on Sch D (lines 1a and 8a). If you have wash sales, those items should be separated from the rest and shown on Sch D (in summary) on lines 1b and 8b and then detailed on Form 8949.

FYI, if you are able to, always a good idea to try to check your brokers calc. I use ETrade and when RKT issued a dividend which resulted in options being repriced they changed the cost to $0. I contacted them and they corrected it to show the correct cost. Had they not corrected it, would probably have had something like $15K in overreported income.",aka0007,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mv5cmh/taxes_on_100_stock_trades/gvbr110/,0.018,0.914,0.068,0.7672

Wish I was American right about now.

This doesn't work in Canada. Different tax rules and forms, I think, that don't allow your software to calculate a DCA on multiple trades in the same equity.

So in summary I'm hearing: as long as it's the sameish stock, bought within 30 days, the IRS doesn't care about the individual profit of each share, just your total gain loss?

936,ACB," If you're gonna trade a lot (particularly the same security) either:
1) hire someone to save you time
2) keep a running tally of your dollar cost average / average cost base (ACB)

I made over 100 trades last year and am at 200 this year ... It's not so bad with single positions but regardless they want you to calculate your ACB in Canadian dollars which means applying the F/X on the DAY of each trade.

There is one website that sort of does it for you but it was running slow for me so I just wrote a formula in Excel but still a giant PITA.

Basically you need to pay taxes on your net capital gains (CAD). Losses are carried forward or back. If you incur a loss within 30 days of buying the stock it is an ineligible loss and needs to be added back to the cost basis (unless you have closed out the position and don't rebuy within 30 days).

Also if you own more than 100K CAD in US equities (cost basis not market value) at any time in the year in a non registered account you need to file form T1135 ...

At least that's what I learned this weekend. I am not a tax expert though. There are sites out there that verified this so I'm pretty sure.",bigdawgruffruff,5,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mv5cmh/taxes_on_100_stock_trades/gva7nme/,0.07,0.843,0.087,0.5032

997,NIO," NIO is selling around 7,000 vehicles a year. Much of the engineering around the vehicles is their own, even though they do outsource the manufacturing. Note that stock price was under $1.50 as they had issues right after the ES8 launch. They didn’t climb out of that until recently with their production and sales volumes increasing. Even then, the price was raised by TSLA’s S&P 500 addition.

And no, the Fisker Karma had many issues including incomplete software, excessive weight, underperforming motors, and so forth. They never achieved the promised power and powertrain reliability was an issue.
