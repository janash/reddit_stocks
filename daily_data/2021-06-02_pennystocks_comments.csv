56,SO," You know, it’s like your SO tells you that they’ve got a big surprise for you at home for your birthday. After a long day at work, you get home, your SO is standing outside to greet you.

He unzips his pants and proceeds to empty his bladder right onto your face. Seems like forever. This guy had really been saving up. So many questions? Who is this? Why me? Why so much piss?

Finally he’s done, your SO apologizes and says “that’s not the surprise”. So you keep walking into your house. There you find the twin of the 8ft tall man. He unzips. Slaps you across the face with his cured salami, and proceeds to dump his bladder. 

It’s at this point you ask, “why don’t I just leave?” It’s all kinda bullshit at this point. Getting pissed on isn’t pleasant at all, and your SO is kind of a lying and evil person. But you don’t leave. For whatever reason you still believe that there is a great surprise that will make the Olympic swimming pool’s worth of piss all worth it. 

Finally the second guy is done. Your SO escorts you to the bedroom. Wow. You think maybe all of your friends are in there or you’re about to get the best sex of your life. Something. Nope.

On paper I'm in the black every month and EOY. But in reality, a startup is a money vacuum with a shitload of nickel/dime expenses and a lot of rob peter/pay paul.

It's definitely a red flag, but if leadership looks good and the other boxes are ticked off and looking okay, low cash in hand isn't necessarily a deal breaker.

73,IMO," Nice! I always avoid stocks that jump up in price randomly without any recent news, so that's good that there was a catalyst to explain the rise.

> Thoughts? Does this all look legit? 

I don't have a great grasp on NFTs, but with these kind of things, you don't typically have to be the first to market, but rather you just need to do it better/easier.

Have you used both Cryptokitties and Microbuddies? If so, how does the ease of use compare between the two? I notice that Microbuddies is using MetaMask/Eth, so guessing it's not too difficult for the average crypto-user to pick up.

From an artwork perspective I think Microbuddies has a long way to go, but again, NFTs aren't really my thing, so maybe the exclusiveness to some people might bypass the work-in-progress artwork they're currently using.

IMO, if the NFT was the only thing they're working on, it'd probably be a pass from me, just because that's super speculative and there appears to be another, farther along, project out there. But that doesn't mean they couldn't pull a ""Facebook"" and blow Myspace out of the water down the line.

It does seem like they have other things going on though, so it doesn't scream SCAM to me. Might be worth throwing a bit of change into as a YOLO, but I wouldn't be betting the house on it.",browncoats4lyfe,2,/r/pennystocks/comments/nqsne8/gmer_whats_the_catch_dd/h0co30s/,0.015,0.84,0.144,0.9859
74,TYME," Some recent and future catalysts that may driving the stock to the $2.50+ per share territory...  
  
\- TYME's 2021 ASCO abstract for drug candidate SM-88 in Ewing and other sarcomas reveals stable disease was achieved in 75.0% (6/8 with available data) with no serious drug-related AEs.  
  
\- Clinical results thus far from trials of SM-88 in multiple advanced cancers, including pancreatic, prostate, sarcomas, breast, and other cancers have demonstrated the significant potential of the company's CMBT pipeline.  
  
\- The company's TYME-19 patented COVID-19 therapy is formulated to overcome any mutations of the virus. When the patent was announced TYME jumped almost 300%. Proof-of-concept trials to start in 2H2020.  
  
\- On February 8, 2021, TYME announced that it closed its previously announced registered direct offering of 40M shares of its common stock at a purchase price of $2.50/share. The company is now funded to 3Q 2022. TYME may use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire or invest in businesses, products and technologies that are complementary to its own.  
  
\- On June 10, 2021, TYME executive management team will provide an updated business plan derived from the conclusions of the Company’s comprehensive strategic review that was conducted over the past several months. The goal of the strategic review was to assess TYME’s current pipeline, explore additional development opportunities, examine drug development process and determine how best to maximize the efficiency of the Company’s capital expenditures.

78,CTO," Sorry, but AMYZF is not competition to ABML.  

ABML has **ex-Tesla Ryan Melsert** as CTO, grants and/or support from **BASF, DuPont, the Department of Energy**, a partnership with American Lithium to test new extraction technology, and a **closed-loop battery recycling** method that is substantially faster, lower in cost, and greener than any competitors in the industry.

AMYZF on the other hand...the announcement yesterday is limited purely to scrap generated in battery development (from your AMYZF link: *”feedstock material used in these recycling tests comes from lithium-ion battery production waste”*).  This is exceptionally narrow and limited in scope.

**ABML will be a giant in the recycling and extraction space**, and the same just isn’t true for AMYZF at this stage in the game.
