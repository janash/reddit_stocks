3,JP," JP could solve the problem by issuing stock, but they have no desire to do so since it will dilute earnings.  As for MM funds, they wouldn't be buying anymore in treasuries than JP would to support the deposits.

4,JP," They just can't do anything productive with the money.  Right now loan origination isn't limited by capital or reserve levels, it's limited by the pool of eligible borrowers.  So if JP Morgan takes on deposits they have to do something that generates a lower return with them, like dump them into excess reserves at the Fed or buy treasuries that don't return too much with them.  But with SLR they also have to post extra tier 1 capital to cover those assets since it doesn't treat them as risk-free.

Here's some math:

Let's say that a big bank can generate a 10 basis point spread between what they pay depositors and what they make by dumping money into t-bills or as excess reserves at the Federal Reserve.

If the bank takes on a billion dollars in extra deposits they would need to raise or hold onto an additional $30M in Tier 1 capital, this is fairly expensive capital btw either common stock or preferred equity.  However they would only be generating around $1M in interest in such a scenario.  So they're getting around a 3.33% yield off that Tier 1 capital which might cost them 5%+ to actually raise (preferred equity).  That's before inflation and completely ignoring the fact that a 1-YR T-Bill currently yields only 8 basis points and IOER (what the Fed pays for extra reserves) is only 10 basis points itself.  It might literally cost them money to take on extra deposits that they don't need here.

They could also retain earnings and not pay out dividends or do share buybacks to raise the capital, but again they're literally making next to no money off these deposits anyways so their shareholders are likely better off by simply having the bank not accept deposits and have more capital to return.",ObservationalHumor,8,/r/investing/comments/maqmx6/jp_morgan_may_soon_turn_away_deposits_from/grua53u/,0.054,0.892,0.054,-0.0206

6,JPM," There is a difference between reserves and equity. The SLR rule says that banks needs to put up $150 billion of equity. Equity is shareholder capital, and no amount of deposits will generate a penny of shareholder capital, not directly anyway.

JPM does have $280 billion in equity, but they definitely do not have $150 billion of equity to spare.",lee1026,14,/r/investing/comments/maqmx6/jp_morgan_may_soon_turn_away_deposits_from/gru3wdh/,0.026,0.916,0.058,0.4497
7,JPM," The limit is based on equity, or how much money a bank have that **don't** have to be returned.

By taking a deposit, you are getting money, but it is money that you have to return, so your equity don't increase.

Under SLR rules, each $100 in bonds need to have $3 in equity and $97 in deposits. JPM have limited equity, and so need to start turning away deposits or raise more equity. JPM apparently don't want to raise more equity, so here we are.",lee1026,3,/r/investing/comments/maqmx6/jp_morgan_may_soon_turn_away_deposits_from/gru4bh3/,0.07,0.93,0.0,-0.6281
8,SV," Too many people pumping this stock without realising what they actually do. You've listed Twist, Fulgent and NeoGenetics as competitors and I'm not entirely sure why. You may as well have listed off any biotech company. 

They're an interesting company but a circa 2.5bn market cap is insane.  Yes, they can identify SV's very well, but they don't capture the underlying sequence which means that they fit into a fairly niche use case. You also mention PacBio and a few papers but research institutions are already invested in sequencing platforms from PacBio as well as Oxford Nanopore for SV detection. On top of that the bioinformatics pipelines to detect SV's from short read sequencing (Illumina) are only getting better. In terms of the scientific literature, there are actually very few publications using Saphyr. PacBio on the other hand was recently used in a massive study to map the centromeres (essentially the last missing piece of the human genome). 

They remind me of the bone density scanners from the film ""The Pursuit of Happiness"": They do a slightly better job at a very specific thing, but are only worth buying in very limited cases. If it drops in valuation it's definitely worth a look at but like I said at the beginning, 2.5bn is madness.",ButtFlannel69,7,/r/investing/comments/ma9f0t/bngo_bionano_genomics_dd_the_future_of_genomics/grtjow8/,0.06,0.77,0.17,0.9767

17,ALL," BNGO was less than 50 cents in December. Up 1518% in three months and you see growth potential? No offense, but the whole sector is bonkers even within the already overvalued tech as a whole.

For what can happen if you do not present a bear case, see what happened to an arguably (worse, and way smaller) investment opportunity in the Biomedical Science Market, Idera Pharmaceutical (IDRA).

One clinical trial went sideways last week and the stock went from 5.21 USD on Friday close, to the news hitting after market, to a AH value of 1.9650 USD.

As of today she is at 1.78 USD, with a drop of market cap of 68% or 83.67 Million.

95,API," I'm looking for some portfolio analysis and tracking tools.  

Any information or suggestions would be greatly appreciated - even if the suggestion is somewhere else to post that may be a better/targeted audience.

Specifically: 

* I'd like data and a plot of whole-portfolio performance with **dividend reinvestment counted as profit/gains**.  
* A resolution of daily close would be ideal.
* The ability to compare to major indices would be nice

Background:

My brokerage account is in ETrade.  I've tried ETrade Pro and Power ETrade.  The ""Portfolios->Performance"" area in ETrade is as close as I've found to what I'm looking for.

I wrote my own simple program in Python to do exactly what I want, but it is a pain to get new position data into it.  I even tried getting the ETrade API up and running in Python to solve this, but ran into challenges and circled back around to - ""why am I doing this - I feel like I can't possibly be the only one out there that wants to see this information presented this way"". 

I'm a generally long-term investor.  I'm not making a ton of trades, but I do add to my portfolio bi-weekly, so I have quite a few individual positions with differing cost basis to track.  Most of my positions are in a few ETFs, but I do have some in a few more speculative areas.",InquisitiveFactotum,1,/r/investing/comments/maixu3/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gruvhr2/,0.02,0.89,0.09,0.8568

97,ACH," Disclaimer: I’m not a cpa, etc..

> As I understand it, I have to pay taxes four times a year now

No you don’t. It only means that if you do nothing, you will likely underpay taxes for 2021 and if it’s enough, pay interest and a small penalty for the amount you underpaid when you file taxes in 2022.

> What is the easiest way to pay this?

For federal, you can pay estimated taxes online from the website through ACH.

For your last two questions, you have to guesstimate the tax. I wouldn’t change your w4 (see below) since this is a one time thing. I’d just make a one time estimated tax payment before April 15. For the calculation, what I typically do is use your marginal income tax bracket for 2020 and multiply that by 15000 and round up.

Another way to solve this is find the minimum amount of money you have to prepay to not get penalties and make sure you pay that. If your total with holdings is at least the amount you paid in tax in 2020, you won’t be penalized. So you can adjust w4 this year to be at least that. Note that I’m going off my memory of the rule here. I know some states income tax rules are different in this regard and my thresholds might have overlapped.",FinndBors,2,/r/investing/comments/maixu3/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/grtfi6b/,0.053,0.904,0.043,0.1779

103,APHA," *tl;dr –* Multiply TLRY's price by 0.8381. If the result of that equation is higher than APHA's current price, buy APHA. If the result of that equation is lower than APHA's price, buy TLRY. In math:

TLRY \* 0.8381 = X

If X > APHA, buy APHA

If X < APHA, buy TLRY

&#x200B;

*Long version –*  
In the case of TRLY/APHA, each share you own of APHA will automatically convert to 0.8381 shares of TLRY. (The conversion is automatic, you don't need to do anything. New ticker will be TLRY. APHA just goes away.)

Using the numbers you provided, if TLRY is at $23 and APHA is at $19 at the time of the merger, you would be better off owning APHA because $23\*0.8381=$19.28. In this scenario, you would sort of make $0.28 on each share when APHA shares convert to TLRY.

Every single time I've checked since the merger was announced, APHA has been the better deal, so the one to buy. As the merger approaches, the gap between them will continue to narrow until there's probably no difference in buying one or the other.

Yes, considering index being ""overvalued"" is your minority opinion and not consensus whatsoever. He asked for a good S&P500 fund, and that's a pretty easy answer to give.

It's diversified across every sector. If he had asked for an energy play, BPMP would have been an appropriate response.
