Things you can look at to address your 'limitations of analysis':

1. calculate the beta of the portfolio
2. calculate Sharpe ratio of the portfolio and compare to S&P500
3. calculate upside/downside capture
4. regress the portfolio against different factors to calculate alpha and exposure to different market risk factors (such as fama french -- commonly used)

236,GE," I get your hesitance, this place gets manipulated by big and small ‚Äî but hear me out.

I‚Äôm a regular guy, and I‚Äôd been working on something in parallel to this for months back in the winter. The data comes from public filings that go into a system called Edgar. Congress are the closest things we have to psychic‚Äôs, that‚Äôs what this comes down to imo ‚Äî I was sitting here wondering about my investments one day, stewing about some private lossporn I‚Äôd made and I wondered ‚Äúwho? Who knows? I‚Äôm sick of guessing‚Äù. Nobody knows, but out of all the nobodies, congress knows the most. They set the rules, they hear whispers of what company is going to get things like antitrust violations or whatever before anyone else does. In a world of guesses, ‚Äúthey‚Äù might be making the most educated guesses.

But when I looked, I saw so much loss porn, it was crazy. The guy who made the system above (the tracker) posted a great one a month or so ago when I first noticed his work. It was a story about someone who‚Äôd bought Tesla a few years back, then took losses for an entire year. What did he do? He doubled down like a fucking ape. Good job, right? Then he holds it for more losses and sells it a month before a yearlong bullrun on the stock. It was the most embarrassing thing I‚Äôve ever seen.

I have no doubt there‚Äôs good data in there, and I think these guys are absolutely onto something. Hell, I‚Äôve made a few trades based on the data I saw initially, like overall congress LOVES General Electric. When I saw that I realized they hold so much GE that they clearly aren‚Äôt going to sanction it into the ground for anything. 

The main problem I saw with this was the filing delay. We get the data too late and you‚Äôre right that we can absolutely be manipulated by this into being bag holders though.

While I'm sure this post took a lot of effort, its borderline worthless. There are definitely corrupt people in congress but they aren't getting rich from insider trading besides possibly a few outliers. They get rich from a lot of different revenue streams that are controversial, like closed door meetings and lobbying contributions. For example turbotax only spends about $2 million a year to prevent the IRS from just doing our taxes free and automatically.

325,GME," Your words from your post 1 month ago that had 24k+ upvotes and hundreds of awards:

""The silver market is and has been rigged for years. WSB was never moving into silver. The media got the story wrong.The general theme could be described as this: If banks hold the silver, the price is allowed to rise, but if you hold the silver, the price is forced to fall.""

Guess what silver prices have done for the past 300 years. THEY'VE DECREASED. People stopped using it as currency which was its main reason for having value. ""But products like EVs and smart phones still use silver!"" Yea, but not much, and people have gotten really good at strip mining entire mountains with machinery to get the raw materials they need thus decreasing the price of those raw materials. Originally people were mining silver by hand and panning for gold in rivers. Look at the production rate of silver over the past 50 years. You'll notice that supply quickly caught up with any demand.

Where am I getting all this jargon nonsense bearish silver sentiment from? [https://sdbullion.com/silver-price-history](https://sdbullion.com/silver-price-history) . Go take a look yourself. SGS-ALT inflation adjusted chart shows you all you need to know. People who have been hoarding silver for generations have gotten fucked. That's why every silver stacker I see is an old man losing his fucking hair. If there was enough demand for silver you wouldn't need to encourage people to buy it. It would just go up in price.

Also notice that anytime anyone pro-silver posts a chart of silver price over time it never shows more than 50 years of history? Also notice how its never inflation adjusted? Did you know aluminum  used to be more valuable than gold when it was first being produced? You know what I use aluminum for now? Protecting my $2 baking sheet from my $1/lb chicken breasts.

346,AG," I see your point but feel differently for a few reason:

1) we didn‚Äôt have the internet throughout the history of silver like we do now (more specifically for the last 110 years or so of bank manipulation), thus the common man couldn‚Äôt communicate and collaborate as easily as now (I.e. GME squeeze wasn‚Äôt possible even 5-10 years ago as people weren‚Äôt all over on Reddit, Twitter, etc.)

2) silver production is largely a byproduct of other resource mining at this point, mostly due to the low price but also due to the fact that it‚Äôs a fringe ore that is usually found peripherally to other metals like gold, iron, aluminum, etc.

Therefore, when price skyrockets and/or demand skyrockets it‚Äôs not as simple as just ‚Äúopening new mines‚Äù. There is a significant delay between exploration and development before production/release of silver. The production has recently started tapering in recent months/years as the lag between no new mines being opened in the past years and the supply effects catches up. 

In the coming years, due to inelastic industrial demand, skyrocketing inflation, and increased retail investment demand, I believe the banks paper silver game will finally be exposed (they don‚Äôt have the physical silver they pretend to, and they‚Äôre deathly afraid of getting caught with their pants down) and there will be a significant lag before silver production is able to be meaningfully increased...

469,AT," Do you lump all commodities together? Grains have seen the biggest of their move, but cattle prices are still at historically low levels while meat packing margins are the highest in history. Cattle prices take the longest of the meats to react to input and demand shocks. Hog prices have had an awesome run the last few months while cattle have been relatively quiet because of the turnaround in the production cycle. A hog cycle is close to 8 months while the calf cycle could be up to 2 years. I have no doubt cattle will catch up in time as they have done historically. The 2012 drought caused $7-$8 corn like we have now, and cattle prices nearly doubled...after a year of consolidation. History will repeat itself.

545,XL," Do you have a source for this? 


The Keystone pipeline is still in service. The Keystone XL pipeline (phase 4 of the project) was shut down, and it was never finished so it couldn't affect oil prices. 


Not to mention, overseas oil is literally cheaper than NA oil. Remember when oil was $30 a barrel one year ago? Oil rigs were being shut down everywhere because it was impossible for them to profit on drilling at those prices.",outofideastx,6,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/narfhp/inflation_is_real/gxvklip/,0.0,0.958,0.042,0.504
546,BP," the pipeline was bad in the long term tbh 

&#x200B;

1. Building the Keystone pipeline and opening up the Tar Sands will negatively impact national and local economies: Burning the recoverable tar sands oil will increase the earth‚Äôs temperature by a minimum of 2 degree Celsius, which NYU Law School‚Äôs Environmental Law Center estimates could permanently cut the US GDP by 2.5%. At the same time state and local economies are already buckling under the real-time economic effects of our nation‚Äôs dependence on fossil fuels. In the past two years, the vast majority of U.S. counties ‚Äú‚Äú 67 percent ‚Äú‚Äú were affected by at least one of the eleven $1 billion dollar extreme weather events. Superstorm Sandy alone caused an estimated $80 billion in damage. The drought that affected 80% of US farmland last summer destroyed a quarter of the US corn crop and did at least $20 billion damage to the economy.  
  
2. The same fossil fuel interests pushing the Keystone pipeline have been cutting, not creating, jobs: Despite generating $546 billion in profits between 2005 and 2010, ExxonMobil, Chevron, Shell, and BP reduced their U.S. workforce by 11,200 employees over that period. In 2010 alone, the top five oil companies slashed their global workforce by 4,400 employees ‚Äú‚Äù the same year executives paid themselves nearly $220 million. But at least those working in the industry as a whole get paid high wages, right? Turns out that 40 percent of U.S oil-industry jobs consist of minimum-wage work at gas stations. Instead of bankrolling an industry that is laying off workers and threatening our economic future, isn‚Äôt it time to take the billions in subsidies going to oil companies and invest instead in a sector that both creates jobs and protects the planet?  
  
3. Unemployment will rise: According to Mark Zandi, the Chief Economist of Moody‚Äôs Analytics: ‚ÄúSuperstorm Sandy wreaked havoc on the job market in November, slicing an estimated 86,000 jobs from payrolls.‚Äù¬ù In the wake of Hurricane Irene, the number of workers filing unemployment claims in Vermont went from 731 before Irene to 1,331 two weeks afterwards. Hurricane Katrina wiped out 129,000 jobs in the New Orleans region ‚Äú‚Äù nearly 20 percent. For the U.S. economy as a whole, 2011 cost US taxpayers $52 billion.  
  
4. Poor and working people will be disproportionately affected: KXL and projects like it result in disproportionately negative impact on already struggling working families. According to a recent report by the Center for American Progress called ‚ÄúHeavy Weather: How Climate Destruction Harms Middle- and Lower-Income Americans, lower-and middle income households are disproportionately affected by the most expensive extreme weather events. Sixteen states were afflicted by five or more extreme weather events in 2011-12. Households in disaster-declared counties in these states earn $48,137, or seven percent below the U.S. median income.  
  
5. Building the sustainable economy, not the Keystone pipeline, will create far more jobs: Our nation is in desperate need of jobs. Approving the Keystone pipeline locks our nation into a trajectory of guaranteed job loss and threatens the stability of the US economy. Why keep the ‚Äújob-killing‚Äù¬ù course, when the alternative-energy path is already out-performing other sectors of the economy. For example, the solar industry continues to be an engine of job growth ‚Äî creating jobs six times faster than the overall job market. Research by the Solar Foundation shows a 13 percent growth in high-skilled solar jobs spanning installations, sales, marketing, manufacturing and software development ‚Äî bringing total direct jobs to 119,000 in the sector. And according to the Political Economy Research Institute at the University of Massachusetts‚Äù‚ÄúAmherst, investment in a green infrastructure program would create nearly four times as many jobs as an equal investment in oil and gas.  
  
A study by Synapse Energy Economics developed a Transition Scenario for the electric power industry based on reducing energy consumption, phasing out high-emission power plants, and building new, lower-emission energy facilities. The study estimated the number of ‚Äújob years‚Äù¬ù ‚Äú‚Äù one new worker employed for one year ‚Äú‚Äù that would be created by the Transition Scenario over a decade:  
  
444,000 job-years for construction workers, equivalent to 44,400 construction workers working full time for the entire decade.  
90,000 job-years for operations and maintenance workers, equivalent to about 9,000 full time workers employed over the decade.

574,PM," The only problem is that gold prices have been rather pitiful the last half year due to the same folks who rail about PMs buying into that other new thing that isn't allowed here. Despite all the printing and inflation it's down over the last 6 months, though it did jump a little this month as that other asset has sort of slowed it's price growth.

PM might do ok anyway, but that's just another question mark as to whether you'll get the sort of incredible they saw in the 70s.

It's also still a real question as to whether this inflation is transitory, a lot of this will probably depend on whether people start demanding wage increases as the price of everything goes up. If those wage increases occur then the inflation will be much more likely to become permanent. I suspect some wage increases will occur, because companies are having trouble getting people to come back because unemployment payments have been pretty good and sometimes better than old wages. Inflation is sort of self-sustaining in that inflation drives more inflation. I think that's why Powell keeps insisting that it's going to be temporary. You need everyone to believe that it's temporary so it stays that way.",bittabet,4,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/na85cz/negative_real_rates_will_go_into_uncharted/gxtp4f0/,0.074,0.85,0.077,0.1655

662,GDP," The problem is, we don't really know how much of the consumer price index increase is real inflation or just reflecting the supply/demand shocks.

So many factors at play:

* Demand - It's still low in some areas and isn't coming back in others. But for some things like raw materials, demand is skyrocketing because of changes in consumer habits (like buying homes).
* Supply - Also like demand, it's down in some areas as certain businesses haven't returned to normal production levels. While in others it's unaffected.
* Job market - It's crowded in some places, which labor shortages exist in others. Especially in low-paid jobs. Labor shortages can drive up costs.
* Shipping - Almost every product needs to be shipped, often multiple times. But many truck drivers took the pandemic as a time to retire or take a career shift. Since people have been preaching how self-driving vehicles are going to put them all out of work for decades at this point. So shipping costs have skyrocketed.

So really, if you want to find the true inflation number. Find a collection of commodities that's not been impacted by supply/demand changes and aren't shipped or require low-paid labor. Measure increase in the price of that commodity. The problem is the pandemic is so impacting that almost no market was left untouched.

Really, what we're talking about, is how hard is it to actually find the true amount of inflation. No one index or figure tells the whole story, and it's not just the aggregate of all of them. Otherwise, inflation would just be GDP.

So yes, the price increases may very well be transitory in respect of the consumer price index.",ShadowyInsights,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/narcj3/inflation_is_not_goddam_transitory_stupid/gxw27v3/,0.078,0.801,0.121,0.9539

761,DD," I love that someone is actually talking about Medicare bc I live my life in the Medicare space as a broker, so I match Medicare buyers with sellers. I don‚Äôt know $clov but I‚Äôve seen it mentioned a lot on here so I‚Äôll have to do some research. Company wise look at Humana, United healthcare and anthem. They all carry Medicare advantage and have become very competitive in the Medicare supplement space whereas they had no interest being competitive a few years ago. If clov‚Äôs focus is outcome based, then they are in the Medicare advantage space. Most seniors, especially younger seniors want a supplement not an advantage plan. Advantage plans are great for vets, low income urban populations and older seniors who don‚Äôt travel for extended periods of time, aka not for snow birds. Just based on my business, I would say the Medicare supplement market will explode, but also prescription drug plans. In this space again you have Humana as a leader, WellCare (centene), United healthcare and Aetna/cvs. Anthem has entered the space but isn‚Äôt big yet, at least in my selling area. I don‚Äôt know how clov plays into this, but maybe I‚Äôll do my first DD on the subject, but definitely this space will be a really big deal if we see a Medicare buy in pass. 
From my phone, I‚Äôll edit later for corrections.

823,DEA," I would argue SSRI and SNRIs are not major breakthroughs at all.  In fact, the mechanisms of the drugs and their explanations are horse manure.  

Ketamine has been around longer than any SSRI and SNRI treatment.  It works in glutamate pathways as does psilocybin.  Given the prevalence of glutamate in the brain, we see explosive action in the brain with these alternative treatments.  I would caution you with your equating psilocybin mechanisms to any SSRI action.  It simply doesnt work like these drugs.

Medical psychiatry has unfortunately harmed generations of indviduals with reliance on SSRI and SNRI drugs where efficacy rates border on laughable in placebo tests.  They create dependency, almost uniformly have no impact on plasticity, and have horrific side effect profiles.  However, they have dramatically increased dependency on psychiatrists and driven revenue for the health system with med check up visits.

849,CIA," The context is long and sounds fucking insane, but the gist is the Army created a program to find intelligence officers that may have latent psychic abilities. They sent them to a special training facility out in the woods to hone those abilities. The training regimen and private company they contracted to run it still exist if you want to pay to get the same training. The goal was to be able to spy on adversaries through remote viewing or astral projection. Some of the viewers reported being able to view a location at any point in time. This report is one of a series of viewings of a specific location on Mars, in this case, one million years in the past. It corroborates some of the information from other viewers looking at the same location in the 80s. Supposedly they found large underground structures that they described as abandoned cities.

I know it basically sounds like the plot to Stranger Things, but it was a real program. The government used to deny that it existed, then lied about it being shut down while keeping it active under CIA control instead of the Army for years. Officially the program was shuttered for not providing enough actionable reliable intel. However, the program did have some noteworthy successes, like seeing and giving detailed measurements of a Soviet submarine that was nearly twice the size of what we thought their largest sub was. The report was initially ignored as completely ludicrous until we got another sighting of it from a satellite and confirmed from recon plane flyover a few months later.

The program operated under half a dozen code names over the years, and was initially several separate initiatives that were all combined in 91 under the code name Stargate Project. One of the intel officers involved was interviewed extensively for the book The Men Who Stare at Goats which was later adapted into an awful movie.",DorkHonor,12,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/naer45/can_wsb_collectively_confirm_ufos_do_or_do_not/gxthxop/,0.077,0.826,0.098,0.8158

Fun side tangent, when the military decided that remote viewing was bullshit they started looking for precognition instead. The test is pretty simple. You show the test subject a series of images most of which are fairly mundane. Some of them are quite shocking or jarring though. You closely monitor pupil dilation throughout the test as there's a fairly obvious dilation response to the shocking images, but what they're looking for are those that consistently show that dilation response a few seconds before being shown the image. Supposedly they've found subjects that consistently respond around 3-5 seconds in advance of the stimulus.

My thesis is consistent with yours.  

How I'm playing it however is a leveraged play through Entree Resources (ETG:TO).  Current share price = $0.82 CAD.

What makes this play interesting is their JV interest in the large copper/gold development in Mongolia. The mining license is majority held by Turquoise Resources / Mongolia govt.  Rio Tinto is also involved.

To make things more interesting, Entree has large insider ownership between Sandstorm Gold (22%) Turquoise Hill (8%) and Rio Tinto (9%), as of February.  A bunch more insider buying has occurred and these numbers are higher (Sandstorm for sure).

923,FSD," Something about redirecting Chinese production to sell in Europe, delivery numbers being down in China, Teslas getting pulled over by Chinese cops, no PR team saving them in the PRC, and Giga Berlin being delayed (waiting for the shoe to drop on Austin delays), tech and ARKK currently getting whacked, commodity prices rising.

Near term sentiment is negative.  Might be a good IV play, but $57 is an odd number without much liquidity.

I see two possible near term upside catalysts to catch this and hold it above $600.

1)  FSD beta 9 comes out shortly and delivers what Musk has been saying will blow your mind in terms of step change improvements.  Cue fanboi youtube videos.

2)  Releasing plans for their ""economy"" car - Tesla model 2?  that has a price point and specs that get people excited.",SecretUsername2000,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/napius/the_big_tesla_short/gxvlx4b/,0.068,0.855,0.077,0.3071
924,AMZN," That's not a price target or valuation, though if you're going off PE ratios look no further than AMZN circa 2016 at about 1,000. 
The core auto business posted over $5B in gross profit while building out multiple international production sites. They have higher margins than traditional auto manufacturers and have a decent cadence hitting their target production rates. Can you say depreciation? FSD is hella behind, but it's the dominant tech (say nothing of the infrastructure and engineering team they've built to develop it) in the space that will fundamentally change transportation in this country.

Old-auto stocks are essentially just bonds at this point vs a company with real disruptive growth prospects in multiple industries. I'll keep buying until a 3T valuation and hold till about 4.5/5 in 8 years.

926,TV," Tesla's shares traded at less than $100 as early as last April. The majority of its income is coming from the sale of regulatory credits to other auto manufacturers, while its actual auto sales have been tenuous at best since 2020. It's newest luxury sedan, The Model S, is priced between $80-150K, while the sale of its regulatory credits have begun to decline along with their production due to chip shortages across the industry. Do you need more common sense arguments here? Tesla is hemorrhaging money more and more each day. Don't even get me started on their balance sheets. How much of their valuation has been speculative this whole time? 60-70%? And now the illustrious CEO thinks he can claim he has aspergers on live TV for clout. 

Sure, this company still has long-term potential, and name brand recognition may carry it a long way in the future, but EV production and adoption is still years away, even with pipelines shutting down all across the US. My catalyst? Why I decided to enter the position? Rising interest rates. Who is going to buy their product when it's too expensive and when nobody needs their regulatory credits anymore? Do you think they will still collect 100% of the premium by the end of Q2? 

So yes, my bones will feel better, especially after I break even on this trade.",FuckingJacked,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/napius/the_big_tesla_short/gxwey43/,0.013,0.877,0.109,0.9695
