80,AMC," Under the urging of my 16 year old son, I purchased 10 shares at 11.94...and then after watching it for an hour or so, I picked up 10 more at 13.33. (Do yourself a favor, just buy your equivalent of 20 shares the first time and make some more money.)

I will say that I did look at the past 3 years of AMC stock prices and was pleased that even around $12-14  share, it's not at a historical high point. So even if I get stuck with these shares, I think the post-covid hunger to take loved ones to the movies will probably surge the value of movie theaters (and travel, but that's another topic).

196,AMC, I have been riding AMC since April of last year. With AMC I was able to purchase stock in Apple and Tesla which are stocks I have always wanted to own. I then turned 100% profit on Tesla and not so much on Apple. Through all of that that though I have kept buying more AMC every time it dipped that I could. It wasn't much 20 bucks here or 50 there. I now have 280 shares of AMC and the wife and I are planning to build a house this year so I expect all of you to get me to $300 so I can put a fat chunk of change down and the wife and I have already decided some of what we pull out of AMC will be donated somewhere.

Yes, they are limiting how many shares can be bought.

Also, go to a different app.
Robinhood is trying to kill this trade, illegally, to benefit their friends.

Try fidelity, schwabb, try webull, there are other trading apps besides Robinhood. I would get out of Robinhood (and will) but I’m stuck with $3k in Robinhood hood at the moment and was able to buy AMC so I’m sticking with them for now, but I will definitely be dumping Robinhood.

I bought into SNDL a few days ago because I think that medical marijuana is going to gain traction in more US states, and possibly at least decriminalization on the federal level. If and when that happens, SNDL will be able to sell to US customers more easily and gain more market visibility.

337,SNDL," Bear case:

Financials need some work. Down 50% in revenue from Q3 to Q2, nearly doubled operating expenses, not yet profitable. Burns through a lot of cash. Sales decreasing quarterly. Recently offered $100m in shares, leading to dilution. A lot of this could be attributed to COVID however the cannabis cultivation business is a tough one, slim margins and lots of competition. Feel like I should mention despite rising operating costs they have tried to keep debt pay off a priority.

Many people playing US Decriminalization. This is what many people are long on. However, they have many competitors in the cannabis cultivation industry already (canopy, aphria, cureleaf, etc) and it will only rise as decriminalization is passed (which is unknown as to when it will happen). Which brings me to my next point.

The problem with the cannabis cultivation/retail sector is that there is already tons of hype and media coverage over the expected CAGR and growth of the cannabis industry. Many companies are going to be trying to get in on the growth and, in my opinion, it will cause cultivators to cut corners on cannabis growing in order to lower costs to make profit. Demand will force retailers to cut prices to be competitive, and you will have companies fighting to make the best weed. This is already the case in the private cultivation business, where even the top cultivators struggle to grow better weed than home-grown (source: i am a home grower) because it is simply too costly (in terms of trying to generate profit) to cultivate TOP shelf cannabis while trying to sell to an entire market and keep prices competitive. Not saying that every company will have the slimmest margins with minimal profit, because this isn't the case, however this brings me to my next point.

My personal opinion (I am not a financial advisor, just excited for the cannabis industry as a grower myself and trying to provide some insight) is that the most profitable companies in the cannabis industry will be the hands off ones. Ones that do not need to fight to create the best quality or best value cannabis. The competition will be something serious. I am invested in SSPK, the SPAC to acquire WeedMaps (has been profitable for the last 12 years, delivering $160m in revenue 2020 alone), for the reason that they are hands off and do not need to worry about growing it, but they will be the ones in the best place to profit from it (or so is my opinion).

396,SNDL," Bear case:

Financials are barren. Down 50% in revenue from Q3 to Q2, nearly doubled operating expenses, not yet profitable. Burns through a lot of cash. Sales decreasing quarterly. Recently offered $100m in shares, leading to dilution. A lot of this could be attributed to COVID however the cannabis cultivation business is a tough one, slim margins and lots of competition.

Based in [Canada](https://imgur.com/a/AwjzMsL). While they do good work where they are based, I feel that many people are playing the decriminalization in the US. This is what many people are long on. However, they have many competitors in the cannabis cultivation industry already (canopy, aphria, cureleaf, etc) and it will only rise as decriminalization is passed (which is unknown as to when it will happen). Which brings me to my next point.

The problem with the cannabis cultivation/retail sector is that there is already tons of hype and media coverage over the expected CAGR and growth of the cannabis industry. Many companies are going to be trying to get in on the growth and, in my opinion, it will cause cultivators to cut corners on cannabis growing in order to lower costs to make profit. Demand will force retailers to cut prices to be competitive, and you will have companies fighting to make the best weed. This is already the case in the private cultivation business, where even the top cultivators struggle to grow better weed than home-grown (source: i am a home grower) because it is simply too costly (in terms of trying to generate profit) to cultivate TOP shelf cannabis while trying to sell to an entire market and keep prices competitive. Not saying that every company will have the slimmest margins with minimal profit, because this isn't the case, however this brings me to my next point.

My personal opinion (I am not a financial advisor, just excited for the cannabis industry as a grower myself and trying to provide some insight) is that the most profitable companies in the cannabis industry will be the hands off ones.

397,SSPK," Bear case:

Financials are barren. Down 50% in revenue from Q3 to Q2, nearly doubled operating expenses, not yet profitable. Burns through a lot of cash. Sales decreasing quarterly. Recently offered $100m in shares, leading to dilution. A lot of this could be attributed to COVID however the cannabis cultivation business is a tough one, slim margins and lots of competition.

Based in [Canada](https://imgur.com/a/AwjzMsL). While they do good work where they are based, I feel that many people are playing the decriminalization in the US. This is what many people are long on. However, they have many competitors in the cannabis cultivation industry already (canopy, aphria, cureleaf, etc) and it will only rise as decriminalization is passed (which is unknown as to when it will happen). Which brings me to my next point.

The problem with the cannabis cultivation/retail sector is that there is already tons of hype and media coverage over the expected CAGR and growth of the cannabis industry. Many companies are going to be trying to get in on the growth and, in my opinion, it will cause cultivators to cut corners on cannabis growing in order to lower costs to make profit. Demand will force retailers to cut prices to be competitive, and you will have companies fighting to make the best weed. This is already the case in the private cultivation business, where even the top cultivators struggle to grow better weed than home-grown (source: i am a home grower) because it is simply too costly (in terms of trying to generate profit) to cultivate TOP shelf cannabis while trying to sell to an entire market and keep prices competitive. Not saying that every company will have the slimmest margins with minimal profit, because this isn't the case, however this brings me to my next point.

My personal opinion (I am not a financial advisor, just excited for the cannabis industry as a grower myself and trying to provide some insight) is that the most profitable companies in the cannabis industry will be the hands off ones. Ones that do not need to fight to create the best quality or best value cannabis. The competition will be something serious. I am invested in SSPK, the SPAC to acquire WeedMaps (has been profitable for the last 12 years, delivering $160m in revenue 2020 alone), for the reason that they are hands off and do not need to worry about growing it, but they will be the ones in the best place to profit from it (or so is my opinion).

460,HUGE," The biggest test will be how tight we hold once this reaches $20, or close to it. If they can manipulate the price down from there it could cause serious panic selling. They know how many shares were bought in the 15 & up range and how much those people are down currently. Those are the shares they can shake loose the easiest- imo 

If we can reach that $20 area during market hours, weather the storm as it drops waaay back down (10-11 range, maybe lower) and still continue to buy the dips- that’s gonna be a HUGE win. 

I truly don’t know shit. Charts are fucked. Support seems to be in the 10-11 range. Shaky hands are higher up. I feel those are the next target. Allow a lift to the upper teens without much pressure and then slam the price down, make shaky hands try to break even. 

Just a feeling. I don’t know anymore than the neighbors dog. 

Mean dog though.

Edit: if the money you have in here can’t take a 50-75% beating, figure out what you need to do. This is going to be a rough ride. If you like a good fight and want to bloody the lips of these manipulative mother fuckers-  HOLD THE FUCKING LINE !!!!!

Edit : changed my support range from 10-13 to 10-11. It is hard to tell how high the actual support might be because of the manipulation yesterday.

Edit again- I suck at charting. 7-8 range held damn good but that was during the possible illegal bullshit period.",channellock_jehova,7,/r/pennystocks/comments/l7l1gy/amc_megathread/gl8b6ky/,0.148,0.747,0.106,-0.9426

SHORT STOCK DOESN'T HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATE

Hedgefund whales are spreading disinfo saying Friday is make-or-break for $GME. Call options expiring ITM on Friday will drive the price up if levels are maintained, but may not trigger the short squeeze.

It may be Friday, but it could be next week the we see the real squeeze.

DON'T PANIC IF THE SQUEEZE DOESN'T HAPPEN FRIDAY.

It's not guaranteed to. The only thing that is guaranteed mathematically is that the shorts will have to cover at some point in the future. They are trying to get enough people hooked on the false expectation of Friday so that if/when it doesn't happen, enough will sell out of panic/despair. DON'T BE THAT PERSON.

WE LIKE THE STOCKKEEP HOLDING UNTIL THEY FEEL THE PAIN, WHETHER THAT'S FRIDAY OR NEXT WEEK5,000+💎🙌🏻🚀

It's not guaranteed to. The only thing that is guaranteed mathematically is that the shorts will have to cover at some point in the future. They are trying to get enough people hooked on the false expectation of Friday so that if/when it doesn't happen, enough will sell out of panic/despair. DON'T BE THAT PERSON.

534,AMC," I want to cosign this. I bought AMC at 11 regardless of the outcome. Just going by fundamentals and non-meme buying, this stock makes long-term sense. When covid lifts, people are going back to the movies and AMC is going to be the only game left standing. They've got the loan to wait it out, and the initial few months after the vaccine takes hold is going to be a bunch of desperate people missing that big-budget theater experience and social activity.  I'd honestly love to buy more if it dips lower.  Pre-digital rental /sale dominance, AMC was comfortable around 15.  I suspect that it will settle safely at 20.00.

611,TMDI," I do speculative analysis in my professional life, so it helps that I'm already curtailing through a list of stocks every week. I think our approach is intuitive in many ways, but counter-intuitive in a few.

Without going into a lengthy and boring exposition, here are a few key concepts. If a company fails to meet any of these criteria, it's not considered for investment. There are exceptions made for companies in the resource industry.

* 1. **Industry**: The company must exist in an industry where its products and services can rapidly scale
* 2. **Product/Service**: The company must offer a product or service that is unique to the industry or protected by patents and copyright. 
* 3. **Management**: The company must be managed by experienced executives who have a demonstrated history of success in the industry. These executives must also have beneficial access to, or relationships with, other key players in the industry. For instance, if it's a medical device company, the executives should have close relationships with major manufacturers, engineers, or distributors. 
* 4. **Company Stage**: The company must be pre-commercialization. Companies who are still in development provide asymmetrical risk. By gaining exposure prior to revenue, you guarantee that you'll have an open position before the crowd arrives. 
* 5. **Low Volume/Float Ratio**: A low ratio indicates that the company is at a stage of low volatility, where price action is minimal. 
* 6. **Finances**: You need to look at the companies quarterly cash burn, and make sure they have enough capital to carry them through until revenue growth.
* 7. **Partnerships**: Who is the company partnered with? How does that partnership encourage the success of the company? For instance, I opened a long position in TMDI because they have an incentive based partnership with Medtronic, the largest medical device company in the world. 
* 8. **Catalysts**: This is more important for short term traders, who want to enter and exit positions quickly. Is the catalyst 1 month, 2 months, or years away?",thirtydelta,20,/r/pennystocks/comments/l7q5dz/what_is_your_strategy/gla6yd2/,0.041,0.829,0.13,0.9851
612,AMZN," I agree with most people’s posts on what to look for. I am a trained chart technician. So if I see something forming based on charts patterns I’ll enter. It doesn’t matter if it’s AMZN at $3,300+ or a penny stock. They tend to perform the same way. 

I simply scan low priced stocks by clicking through them at a rapid pace. When I see a pattern I write the stock down. I may do this with 3-5 hundred stocks.  If I have to look at it too long... probably not a pattern or one I normally trade. 

Then I’ll come back and analyze a bit more. Is it a trade or investment? Whats short term target (Daily chart)? long term target  (weekly/monthly chart)? What industry is it in?  Do they MAKE stuff that people buy? Or is it some service industry/local stock/idea company?  

I’m specifically looking for something that the algorithms will move, then looking for longer term play.  I don’t want to tie up capital waiting for something to happen. 

Taking profit:

Some people take 1/2 at a 100% gain and let the rest ride. Others take profit out in 1/3 lot increments.   REMEMBER you can always get back in on another buy or sell setup. 

With options: I’ve found it best for me to take 60-70% of my trade off (If a short term strategy)  on the first major move into the direction I’m trading.  Then put in an order to replenish 1/2 the amount I sold at the same entry price I originally entered.   Ex:   Buy 10 contracts @ $X.  On first blast sell 6 contracts then immediately put in order for 3 contracts @ $X.  (The theory is an initial move that explodes volatility then the pullback to the initial purchase option price or a bit less.) 

The idea is to sell the volatility spike then reload when reverts back to the mean.",Greenies21,15,/r/pennystocks/comments/l7q5dz/what_is_your_strategy/glaa6tz/,0.007,0.923,0.071,0.9556
613,NAV," I've been investing/trading for over a decade off and on depending on my financial situation.

Here is my advice:

Check out all the technical stuff on a stock you held that did well/bad.  Look at its history via financials, but also it's history via charts.  Use indicators galore, like Bollinger bands, SMA, MACD, RSI, Williams %R, Volume, Volume by Price, PSAR.  Learn simple stuff, like how bids are demands, asks are supply, and greater demand usually means increased NAV.  Learn about the bid/ask spread.  If you see greater demand, then check the volume and if it is higher than average, compare to RSI (is it above 50), and see if there is a Bollinger band squeeze - all together that may be a strong indication of a break out going up.

But, what if you need to decide to hold long term or short term.  Any time I look at a stock I check a few things immediately: Beta for volatility, put/call ratio (0.7-1.0 is neutral, below that is good sentiment), TTM P/E ratio vs Forward P/E ratio (smaller Forward is good), read any analysis I can find and take a look at the companies site and reviews to determine possible growth as well as possible knowledge assets that may outweigh the competition.  If all the above looks good and the Beta is something I can stomach, then I go long.  If not, fallback to the technical information, and if that doesn't convince you, then stay away.

That was a good deal of technical jargon for someone who may not know any of it, but it is important for you to learn about it.  Investopedia is great for breaking this stuff down barney style.  Go to the site and just go back and forth looking at different things you find on your brokerage site when looking up stocks, your history of making gains and losses.

For penny stocks, if they don't have serious potential for growth combined with great marketing and garnering of customer base, then they aren't worth it to go long.

Always have exit strategies: Exit price 1 @ 20% inc, Exit price 2 @ 50% inc, stop loss @ -15%.  If you don't know where to start with exit strategies, then learn the Bollinger Bands and use top for Exit price 1, and bottom for stop loss.

Lastly, don't buy into a stock because someone tells you to.  Buy into a stock  because you believe in what you see with your own two eyes and the knowledge you gain from researching it gives you good indicators for return even with the risk.",AnUnusedCondom,11,/r/pennystocks/comments/l7q5dz/what_is_your_strategy/glb5tpi/,0.053,0.797,0.15,0.9941

Everyone should absolutely ride the wave - buy low, sell high, make small chunks of money. But holding this long term is a major gamble, especially with how not-so-great their finances are.

SNDL is definitely trying to take over Zenabis, or at least is playing hard and dirty with their debts. If it happens *and* weed is legalized, federally, in the US? Sure, it'll pop off right quick. 

But if both of those don't happen? SNDL drops back down to it's $.50 range, hovers there for a while, and gets delisted.

706,DD," You have a very very valid point . When I first did the DD I was thinking about these things as well. But I don't think Apple watch will ever become CGM certified it is just no where enough as accurate. This is the reason why they will never use your Apple watch at the hospital to check you heart rate or oxygen levels even thought that's what it can do (ithink). Sugar monitoring will always be specialized and will always have to be CGM certified, I would be surprised if apple decided to buy the company and offer it as a package with their watches that would be amazing.

 This product will be the most disruptive in the field since litteraly it will make any type 1 diabetics feel not like a diabetic.

This is going to take off next week. You’re probably wondering if I’m so confident why would you spend the time writing a post on Reddit. The truth is I want this to fly next week, I’m hoping our launch pad starts even higher before things take off. This bad boy is so undervalued at 69 million market cap.

In general looking for a broker I can buy penny stocks through without the commission/fees if possible. Was on TD Ameritrade and $6.95 fee hit me due to app not showing it. 

Curious if anybody has thoughts on either Schwab or Fidelity, alternatively, and if there are really no fees associated with OTC stocks besides if they are foreign companies (on Fidelity afaik). Seems like there are some quirks and drawbacks for each brokerage.

Thanks and hope everybody is well 🤓",thespianclination,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/l7j3pj/the_lounge_thoughts_noob_stuff_low_effort_brokers/gl78w3b/,0.052,0.817,0.131,0.8757

Try some smaller trades to start-I watch EWLL(which is dogshit, but I make dough on it on the regular-it's always well below a penny....it's fun to buy them a half million shares).  They are in OZSC, which is an interesting company but is north of a few cents now.  They are also in and out of a bunch more.  Have fun with it....in penny stocks, as long as you aren't all in on a single one, its fun, and you can train yourself to do the research, and to watch trends.

982,DD," Thanks!!!  This is why I signed up too.  I like making money, but more than that, I like if I can make money while also having fun and trying to be interesting.  I appreciate everyone's kindness and willingness to share.  I've learned a lot from r/pennystocks over the past year, and I am truly grateful.  People hear have read DD, done their own DD, made money, and paid off their house, their mom's medical bills, student loans, etc.  This subreddit (and others) have saved lives.  Obviously, there are also dangers and cautionary tales to investing money that you can't afford to lose, so my heart goes out to those who haven't been so fortunate.  So, I try to remember that everyone I meet is fighting a hard battle, and I try to respond with kindness.  They say that if you give a man a mask, then he will show you his true face, and the reality is that the internet is a mask that we can hide behind where we can say mean things without much fear of repercussion, but I think that there is real repercussion in how we feel about ourselves after we say something unkind.  Again, I'm not perfect.  I just try to be a better version of myself every day.  Sometimes I succeed, and sometimes I don't, but there is tomorrow.  And I try to remember what I heard that Dave Chappell once said.  He said that most people can be funny, but it might be much more important to be interesting.  I really thought about that a lot because humor can be painful if care isn't exercised.  Humor is a funny thing, right?  Being interesting and funny at the same time is tough, and I try my best, but it isn't easy.  I sometimes see unkind comments on other subreddits, and I often wish that if the person had taken 10 extra seconds, where they could have made the same point, but in a nicer way that would be easier to hear and more able to be pondered and accepted.  Words are important.  And so, I try.  And I am grateful for your comment.  Thanks!  Your kind comment gave me the forum to say this, and I am grateful for that as well.  Again, I'm not perfect.

Thanks for the GOLD. Hopefully Sam (CEO) doesn't let us down and puts out the much sought after presentation and annual report. I've been loading heavily sub-penny and expecting great things from this company.

They have already reduced the OS by 50m and I've heard more reduction is to occur. Regardless the OS is much better than any of those stinky pinkies with BILLIONS of shares.

It's also been made known that there's no toxic funding and no plans on any as well as no RS.

Sam has hinted at generating a ICO which is presumed to be used throughout the MJ market.

**Sheridan, Wyoming--(Newsfile Corp. - December 4, 2020) - Critical Solutions, Inc. (OTC PINK: CSLI) announces it has successfully completed the launch of MKH Finance. Mr. Sam Barraza, CEO of MKH Ventures, states, ''We are excited about the new direction of CSLI. As promised one of our first steps is to have our shareholders learn about the multiple streams of revenue owned by the company that allow for our growth in the expanding cannabis market. We have developed relationships that help support the capital needs of the cannabis industry. At MKH Finance, through our parent company of MKH Ventures, we have access to both private and public financing that can be readily deployed in as little as 72 hours. In the cannabis industry time is money and money is the tool to most effectively use time. Our goal is support our clients with debt or equity capital through loans or revolving lines of credit, leases of property we own, or investing in businesses using cash or shares of our common stock. Thanks to Mr. Munck, our Director of Business Development, we are assisting JV partners to secure a new building through direct investment from MKH Ventures with a certain percentage of operations and cultivation coming back to our balance sheet. In the coming weeks, we will highlight each of the multi-million-dollar contracts.""**

**With the global legal marijuana market size expected to reach USD 73.6 billion by 2027 and with potential national legalization, we are confident that our management team will efficiently capitalize on the various real estate, finance, and consulting services we provide to maximize shareholder value.""**

1047,AMD," Take everything you read online with a grain of salt, especially the link you posted from r/investing, and even this very comment. Everyone will have a varying opinion, and those opinions are largely influenced by their personal experience, not objective insight. 

Penny stocks are speculations more than they are investments. You're taking a position in a company that has potential, but has yet to prove its worth. Naturally, this comes with high risk, but that risk also comes with high reward. 

Yes, most penny stocks are worthless, regardless of their market price. The requirements to be listed on the OTC market are very small, and thus questionable companies are able to enter the market with minimal effort. For example, many penny stocks listed on the pink sheets have no obligation to provide the SEC with any information. They submit financial data during their first offering, but that information is rarely updated, and there is no requirement to do so. 

Additionally, most penny stocks have low floats and low volume, so when they experience a burst in price action, the share price can move extremely quickly. This makes penny stocks an appealing destination for pump and dump schemes. 

Now, let's look at the bright side. Just because a stock trades under $5/share (the upper limit for penny stock designation), doesn't mean it's a scam or a bad investment. 

Here are some examples of highly successful companies that were once penny stocks.

Ultimately, I think you have to accept that penny stocks are speculations. They carry a high risk/reward profile, and they require you to do a fair amount of research in order to be successful. With enough due diligence, they can be highly profitable. 

* 1. Amazon
* 2. Apple
* 3. Monster Beverage Corp
* 4. AMD
* 5. Ford
* 6. Snapchat

These are examples that come to mind, but there are countless others.

However, I'm just getting into pennystocks and am currently down 25% this week, I'm guessing because of all the other stuff going on.  Not as much fun as last week.

1049,DD, personally I feel like penny stocks are great when you don't have a large amount of money.  It is one of the few types of stock where you are not stuck buying 1 to 10 shares. Instead you can buy 100 to 100k and your ceiling is a lot higher if you do your DD.

1057,IT," Penny stocks are for everyone, but you need to know what you are doing. I trade penny stocks for a living since 1997.

First I began my trading career during the IT bubble, when every day I had dozens of stocks running 1000% on news  in a matter of 5 or 10 minutes. It was crazy. 

It was easy to make money, but, it was also risky. I won some, I lost some, but I didn't know what I was doing. It was pure luck.

So I decided to learn Technical Analysis to be able to read and understand the charts. So I used the website [stockscharts.com](https://stockscharts.com) to learn TA. It took me 3 years to find my chart template I use until today, but, after one year I was already making money consistently, a lot of money.

It was like robbing a bank every day. I had many days of making $100K in profits, and my best day I made about $300K.

So anyone can make a lot of money trading penny stocks, but you need to learn TA to know where are the supports and resistances, so you know where to buy and where to sell. If not you are trading blind.

For example in this chart you can see I drew some lines. You need to learn which points you can connect, to use those lines as support or resistance points. You buy the supports and sell the resistances. This way you can maximize your profits and avoid the risk of buying a resistance and see your investment going down right after buying.

1061,CEO," I'm sure everyone has their reasons. I'm new here, personally this is just for fun. My 'real' investments are in more traditional places, I don't have the stomach to be playing around with real money in penny stocks.

It's like going to a casino but no one is bringing me drinks. Only bringing money that I can afford to lose.

I've been trying to do research on the promoted companies here, and yeah, a lot of them seem like garbage. 1-2 people as CEO, CFO, COO; No products, No income; or one I was looking at yesterday was nothing but renderings, no real pictures of the stuff they claimed to make/sell. Some are a massive runaround - this company making stuff for this other company who claims to be acquiring another company who's buying the debt of the first company and so on.

But there are also a few that actually are real businesses. They make things. They sell things. They have physical storefronts and income and employees. 

Money can be made on both.

It's an incredibly highly shorted stock, with nothing but good news for weeks now, new locations, partnerships etc.  It's a solid target for punishing shorts, decent stock with the potential of an actual future.  It doesn't have the nostalgia that GameStop or Nokia do, but it's already up .40 in pre-market and just this morning with very little momentum was able to squeeze to 3.70.

I did find something about raising 15 million dollars in private placement offers back in Feb 2020, but I dont understand any of that 😂. Also want to look at a few thing competition wise, but besides all that, here is what I wrote.

First, currently holding 1 mil shares @ $.0001. Grabbed it back in August 2020 off a random post here. Literally bought as a joke to say I own a million shares of a company and as a $100 lotto ticket. I didnt start to actually looking into the company til a few weeks ago. Holding all million for 1-2 years at a minimum (although I did buy another 10k shares at a later date that I'll sell at some point). Do your DD, but with all the upcoming catalysts this one is sitting on the launchpad ready to rocket to Pluto. Actually, here you go in terms of catalysts...

1. Multiple chain retailers are on board and will sign a contract with INND once they reach mid tier OTCQB
2. New product with better tech and for a lower cost coming out in the next 30-45 days
3. Doing a dual PR release with a NYSE chain retailer soon
4. Just announced no reverse split in the near future
5. Been waiting for FDA approval on over the counter hearing aids... law was passed in 2017 to sell and FDA was suppose to approve in 2020, but covid. Wrote a letter at the start of 2021 and expected to hear in the next few weeks. 
6. Currently delinquent on SEC filings, but working to come current within the next 55 days.

The only other competitor is $EAR and they're currently trading around the $50-60 range. They're primed to be up in this area IMO... hell even half of what they're trading would be amazing. Currently selling in Walmart and on Amazon. 

Last but not least, remember I OWN a large cheap/low risk to me position... do your own DD and feel free to verify all my info. I'm not trying to pump (twitter account has 6 followers haha and I havent publically said anything on social media), but every close friend I've told has bought a position into it.

1199,IMO," Here was my reply earlier in an INND post... I havent looked into financials yet as I need my uncle's help with those numbers. I did find something about raising 15 million dollars in private placement offers back in Feb 2020, but I dont understand any of that 😂. Also want to look at a few thing competition wise, but besides all that, here is what I wrote.

First, currently holding 1 mil shares @ $.0001. Grabbed it back in August 2020 off a random post here. Literally bought as a joke to say I own a million shares of a company and as a $100 lotto ticket. I didnt start to actually looking into the company til a few weeks ago. Holding all million for 1-2 years at a minimum (although I did buy another 10k shares at a later date that I'll sell at some point). Do your DD, but with all the upcoming catalysts this one is sitting on the launchpad ready to rocket to Pluto. Actually, here you go in terms of catalysts...

1. Multiple chain retailers are on board and will sign a contract with INND once they reach mid tier OTCQB
2. New product with better tech and for a lower cost coming out in the next 30-45 days
3. Doing a dual PR release with a NYSE chain retailer soon

Remember, it's not only the airlines but the entire travel industry incl. hotels, airports, etc that need to go back to normal.

After careful consideration, I'd say it's not a buy-now stock, but I believe it has potential to be profitable if the company won't go private and survive this crisis. My modest prediction is watchlist for 1 year and hope for the best.

This post is mostly for a discussion purpose to check if my DD was on-point. It is my first penny stock, which I found during my research that's why I bought a small number of shares. Next time I would just add it to my checklist first.

1229,ANY," I fell for the PASO hype for about a week and got off fast realizing I (nor ANY of the investors) had any idea what they were buying into.  I quickly realized that no one seemed to question what revenue if any CLX even had even if they did merge.  It is just a start up venture of another company Sirius IQ who seemed as random of a company as that one.  

I learned from my time with PASO if you can not find the company website, has no good visibility of the managers, and/ or you can't find an internet presence of their management prior work then you only have yourself to blame if things go sour. 

My opinion, don't ""anchor"" and just sell your stock and find the many good ones out there to invest in.  I did am glad I cut loose quick.",10xwannabe,6,/r/pennystocks/comments/l869id/paso_bag_holders/glawnht/,0.075,0.866,0.059,-0.1027

1232,GME, I’m in the process of changing brokers. Once that’s completed and the GME saga settles down I’ll liquidate what I can of my portfolio for profits and spread it between ALPP and ABML,Paytz,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/l869id/paso_bag_holders/glb0m1i/,0.0,0.914,0.086,0.4404
1233,KODK," Shorting would be borrowing stocks, sell, then try to buy back cheaper to repay it. So for instance, KODK went up to $60 at a high back in July 29. I could try to borrow say 100 shares from my broker and sell those 100 shares right away for $60 each giving me $6000. Now I would hope that KODK drops to a lower price, which it did, to buy back the 100 shares I owe. KODK then drops to about $6 per share on August 27. So now I can buy back the 100 shares at $6 a piece coming out to $600. I would then have profited $6000 - $600 = $5400. I would have also lost some money on the interest paid on the borrowed shares.",ShootingTurtle,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/l89b7v/help_with_this_stock/glbg14d/,0.034,0.789,0.177,0.946
