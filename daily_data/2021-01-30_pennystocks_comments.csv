For me, personally, I am choosing not to transfer right now because the squeeze may happen within the next couple of business days and I don’t want to miss it. Transferring your portfolio from RH to Fidelity or any other broker takes a couple of business days and if the squeeze happens during this time, you will be screwed because you wouldn’t have access to anything. 

As a workaround, I  opened up an account on Fidelity and deposited the same amount I did into RH. I plan to buy some more shares on Fidelity at dips around the cost I purchased on RH (this may not be possible to do without a loss if you were able to buy shares on RH at much lower prices).

163,AMC," I went in on a 3k invest on AMC back in December. Went in for 30 5.5calls out to June when I heard the Pfizer vaccine was approved and the moderna vaccine wasn't far behind. This was also the time when Warner bros announced they would release all their 2021 movies straight to streaming and AMC announced they may have to declare bankruptcy in January. 

I went in on Friday. 3k in June 18th calls and another 1.5k in January 22nd calls and 700 AMC shares for an average of 3.50 which I accumulated over time. I had faith they would pull through because I love the movies and i also did a little bit of Due diligence.

I knew that movie studios receive around 60% of the ticket sales and there was no way Hollywood studios would give up that revenue. Straight to streaming is the 2020 equivalent of going straight to DVD in the 90s. Its a death sentence, there's no money to be made especially when many high profile films costs upwards of the 100s of millions to produce.

So there i was, Friday night with maybe a little under 8k invested in AMC. Fast forward a week or so. AMC announces theyre going to sell 200 million shares.
Price drops 5% every day for the next few days down to about 2. I held all the way down to 2 where my 💎 👐 finally turned to paper and I sold my 700 shares. I was down 90% at one point.

Now if you had been paying attention to recent events, you would have caught that I had 30 calls for AMC to expire on the 22nd of Jan... AMC began its meteoric rise the week after.... If I had pushed those calls out to the 29th I would be in tendie town...another smooth brain move I made was sell some $7 calls on my 500 shares of AMC for some quick premium...

In 2008 there was a 2T bailout and many people lost their homes, jobs, and pensions from what I view as gross negligence in the valuation of the CDO securities.  

I for one remember how they used the bailout to give themselves bonuses and then lobby the gov for deregulation

Through the entirety of last week the message was invest at your own risk because we will not get a bailout. Unlike 2008 where they knew they were too big to fail and would get a bailout.

Yes some people will lose, but we told them that was their risk at the start and to do their own DD.

There are some excellent penny stocks (many penny exempt or new companies with real products/ services just getting started), but a lot of the stuff folk are buying are just hype and momentum.  ALL these type of plays should not be more then 10% of one's long term investments.  One should have 90% in buy/ hold passive investments with asset allocation of stocks/ bonds according to one's risk tolerance.  

If one doesn't understand you do not get paid for taking on unsystematic vs. systematic risk then some reading should be done.  There is a difference between investing and speculating.

256,SP," However the next “catalyst” is dosing and efficacy on the mono arm - which should be given to us sometime within the next 1-2 months. Trials have continued to expand so that should be a positive sign. You also have earnings, and you have the bio conference Feb 16-18. However, this is no guarantee the SP moves. We can all see the chart, it’s been kept in a 5% percent variance channel by algo for months. It’s at basically cash value per share - i.e. it has been manipulated to a point it’s drugs have zero value. Both those FDA approved and in market, and those in trials.

265,BE," Here is a post I just put together about $INND... 

THIS CANNOT BE BOUGHT ON WEBULL AND/OR ROBINHOOD... TD Ameritrade and Schwab are 2 prime candidates to buy it on. This is also an OTC Pink Slip which tend to have a much higher risk than stocks on the NYSE. Only invest what you're willing to lose. I am not a financial advisor. Cliff Notes are at the bottom.

With that, I currently hold 1 mil shares @ $.0001. Grabbed it back in August 2020 off a random post here. Literally bought as a joke to say I own a million shares of a company and as a $100 lotto ticket (with zero DD). I didnt start actually looking into the company til a few weeks ago when it started moving. Holding all million for 1-2 years at a minimum (although I did buy another 10k shares at a later date ($.001) that I'll sell at some point). Do your own DD, but with all the upcoming catalysts this one is sitting on the launchpad ready to 🚀🚀🚀 to Pluto. Actually I'll make it easy for you, here you go in terms of catalysts...

1. Multiple chain retailers are on board and will sign a contract with INND once they reach mid tier OTCQB
2. New product with better tech and for a lower cost coming out in March (just posted a tweet of the new product today Friday, 29 Jan 2021)
3. Doing a dual PR release with a NYSE chain retailer in the near future.
4. Recently announced no reverse split... with the current growth and the fact they want to grow organically they're trying to avoid this at all cost.
5. Been waiting for FDA approval on over the counter hearing aids... The Over the Counter Hearing Aid Act was passed in 2017 to sell and FDA was suppose to approve in 2020, but covid. Wrote a letter at the start of 2021 and expected to hear in the next few weeks. They also have 2 politicians pushing the FDA to make a decision sooner than later.

The only other competitor is $EAR and they're currently trading around the $50-60 range. On the topic of Eargo (EAR) Inc, they are only an online retailer with no physical stores. They are however like the Bose Headphones of hearing aids from the sounds of the website. But, it looks like they're target market is upper class... they're cheapest option is the base model at $19XX with the top of the line running you roughly $2950! Gross profit wise they reported $12.8 mil in 3rd quarter... up from $4.2 mil in 3rd quarter 2019. 

They're primed to be up in this area IMO... hell even half of what they're trading would be amazing. Currently selling in Walmart, Sears, another retailer I cant think of, and on Amazon. They're target market is the average Joe IMO. Like I stated earlier, they plan to partner up and sign contracts with a host of other retailers including Target, Walgreens, CVS, Rite Aid, and Best Buy just to name a few. 

$EAR is really the only other competition, but it does give a small insight into the hearing aid market. Another hearing aid company is in Minnesota, but it sounds like that company has a host of upper management issues that is currently putting them in and out of court. They also havent released a product in a few years.

With INND's new product, they'll be selling the base model at $995 and the top of the line at $1450. On top of that, they have a large handful of kiosks in Wal Marts that are free to use (with plans to roll out more in the very near future). What's the purpose of the kiosks? ""InnerScope’s Hearing Loss Information Center will encourage Walmart customers to take immediate action for treating their hearing loss by either being referred locally to a contracted hearing healthcare professional, or by directly purchasing one of InnerScope’s Hearing Products."" They're currently in about 4500 Walmarts.

Now for the bad, but good. They're currently delinquent on SEC Filings. HOWEVER, they're working on becoming current within the next 55 days. The last time they filed financials was back in 2018!

Last but not least, remember I OWN a large cheap/low risk to me position... do your own DD and feel free to verify all my info. I'm not trying to pump (twitter account has 6 followers haha, I generally lurk here, and I havent publically said anything on social media), but every close friend I've told has bought a position into it. Right now you can spend $58 for 10k shares if you want to take a super small position. 

Best part about this is, the CEO updates the company twitter page nightly and is completely transparent!

267,CVS," Here is a post I just put together about $INND... 

THIS CANNOT BE BOUGHT ON WEBULL AND/OR ROBINHOOD... TD Ameritrade and Schwab are 2 prime candidates to buy it on. This is also an OTC Pink Slip which tend to have a much higher risk than stocks on the NYSE. Only invest what you're willing to lose. I am not a financial advisor. Cliff Notes are at the bottom.

With that, I currently hold 1 mil shares @ $.0001. Grabbed it back in August 2020 off a random post here. Literally bought as a joke to say I own a million shares of a company and as a $100 lotto ticket (with zero DD). I didnt start actually looking into the company til a few weeks ago when it started moving. Holding all million for 1-2 years at a minimum (although I did buy another 10k shares at a later date ($.001) that I'll sell at some point). Do your own DD, but with all the upcoming catalysts this one is sitting on the launchpad ready to 🚀🚀🚀 to Pluto. Actually I'll make it easy for you, here you go in terms of catalysts...

1. Multiple chain retailers are on board and will sign a contract with INND once they reach mid tier OTCQB
2. New product with better tech and for a lower cost coming out in March (just posted a tweet of the new product today Friday, 29 Jan 2021)
3. Doing a dual PR release with a NYSE chain retailer in the near future.
4. Recently announced no reverse split... with the current growth and the fact they want to grow organically they're trying to avoid this at all cost.
5. Been waiting for FDA approval on over the counter hearing aids... The Over the Counter Hearing Aid Act was passed in 2017 to sell and FDA was suppose to approve in 2020, but covid. Wrote a letter at the start of 2021 and expected to hear in the next few weeks. They also have 2 politicians pushing the FDA to make a decision sooner than later.

The only other competitor is $EAR and they're currently trading around the $50-60 range. On the topic of Eargo (EAR) Inc, they are only an online retailer with no physical stores. They are however like the Bose Headphones of hearing aids from the sounds of the website. But, it looks like they're target market is upper class... they're cheapest option is the base model at $19XX with the top of the line running you roughly $2950! Gross profit wise they reported $12.8 mil in 3rd quarter... up from $4.2 mil in 3rd quarter 2019. 

They're primed to be up in this area IMO... hell even half of what they're trading would be amazing. Currently selling in Walmart, Sears, another retailer I cant think of, and on Amazon. They're target market is the average Joe IMO. Like I stated earlier, they plan to partner up and sign contracts with a host of other retailers including Target, Walgreens, CVS, Rite Aid, and Best Buy just to name a few. 

$EAR is really the only other competition, but it does give a small insight into the hearing aid market. Another hearing aid company is in Minnesota, but it sounds like that company has a host of upper management issues that is currently putting them in and out of court. They also havent released a product in a few years.

With INND's new product, they'll be selling the base model at $995 and the top of the line at $1450. On top of that, they have a large handful of kiosks in Wal Marts that are free to use (with plans to roll out more in the very near future). What's the purpose of the kiosks? ""InnerScope’s Hearing Loss Information Center will encourage Walmart customers to take immediate action for treating their hearing loss by either being referred locally to a contracted hearing healthcare professional, or by directly purchasing one of InnerScope’s Hearing Products."" They're currently in about 4500 Walmarts.

Now for the bad, but good. They're currently delinquent on SEC Filings. HOWEVER, they're working on becoming current within the next 55 days. The last time they filed financials was back in 2018!

Last but not least, remember I OWN a large cheap/low risk to me position... do your own DD and feel free to verify all my info. I'm not trying to pump (twitter account has 6 followers haha, I generally lurk here, and I havent publically said anything on social media), but every close friend I've told has bought a position into it.

281,IP," I don't think that would be the case. First and for most is that the verdict was during this week when everything was tanking from low volume, frankly money just fled the field. Look at ABML which had great news on Thursday (4.5M DOE grant) and yet finished the day and week down. When there is no volume to prop the price up any stock is going to be pulled down. 

Second I don't believe we have seen the share reduction from that verdict yet. The verdict hasn't also been broadcasted much, as it isn't even a news item on news aggregators like yahoo. 

Third ATVK was about share reductions while HCMC would be a cash settlement and royalties. Cash is king. Shares reduction will not effect your bottom line and is just an item to increase stock price while cash is the lifeblood of a company. With cash the company can expand, invest and grow. Dropping a few million shares isn't going to effect the daily life of the company what so ever, it is entirely for the shareholders. The only impact it would have is if they do a public offering and raise money off the newer more consolidated price. 

ATVK is also weird stock with a hodgepodge of IP/""companies"" under it. I do own 4,000 shares of it but I have my doubts on its value. Most of the companies so far under it remind me of junk you would find at sharper image, Walgreens or other stores that peddle ""As seen on TV"" products.",Kierik,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/l8o8cv/hcmc_this_could_be_one_to_hold/gle2qp8/,0.028,0.885,0.087,0.8519

I saw this stock while scanning lithium stocks and realize they own cesium deposits too. I went to yahoo and price target is $3 in the next 12 months. How accurate, who knows.. what I do know, this is one of less than a handful of miners that control cesium. Feel free to investigate more DD.  

What I do know is that the days of gold and silver are done. These resources aren’t as important when looking to generate power for the 21st century and beyond. They are truly dinosaurs  🦖 and highly manipulated.

These “commodities qualify as “critical minerals” because each has been identified as a non-fuel mineral or mineral material that is essential to the economic and national security of the United States, that has a supply chain vulnerable to disruption, and that serves an essential function in the manufacturing of a product, the absence of which would have significant consequences for the economy or national security” (USGS website: https://www.usgs.gov/news/interior-releases-2018-s-final-list-35-minerals-deemed-critical-us-national-security-and, dated May 18, 2018).

345,DD," I like the potential in this space but there are a lot of players that popped up in the last year so I'm not sure how things are going to play out yet.  I am however invested in Better Plant Sciences - **VEGGF**  

They are currently at $0.09 per share and spun off a partially owned subsidiary NeonMind Biosciences Inc. who is working on and has patents pending for the use of psilocybin for weight loss... imaging the potential opportunity there!!!!!

I’ve been watching Better Plant build their foundation for a year now but you can do some DD on them through their website [https://betterplantsciences.com/](https://betterplantsciences.com/) 

They also just signed a new distribution agreement that could significantly open up sales in the US through a company that successfully launched brands at a national level for Sephora and Nordstrom!!!!!

347,TD," TD Ameritrade has a great platform to paper trade with called Thinkorswim. YouTube and Google have decent info, but you need to take it all with a grain of salt, there are a lot of scammers out there. Some basic rules are: don't buy or sell anything within 30 minutes of the market opening or closing, don't chase a running stock unless it's just taking off, don't trade with money you can't afford to lose, always place limit orders, not market orders, and don't try to force trades. Always have a strategy, stick to it, and learn to accept two things: you will have losing trades, and some days, it's better to shut down your laptop/phone, and walk away from it and just take the day off, because there are just some days, where the setups won't come. Also, and this is just something I've personally done, you might check out these guys www.pennystockelites.wildapricot.org, I've been with them about 6 months, and they have great picks. What I like, is they always provide a financial report on each stock they pick, and you can use their reports to start learning what to look for in different companies.

Remember there are so many great stock opportunities at the moment

An example for me would be BNGO I invested at $2 but with all this growth I'm still very confident about the company because it ticks a lot of boxes and has a very unique product that's why I'm confident for growth.

411,CSCO," There is a rumor/expectation that nokia is going to reintroduce their dividend after the next earning report. However dividends are a % of the share price if nokia comes out with a 5% dividend it will be meaningless. But Microsoft pays a .97% dividend that will easily exceed any hypothetical nokia 5% dividend.

Personally BMWYY and CSCO get to stay in my portfolio because they pump out a nice dividend and they are in the proce range you are looking for.

On the same note if you are looking at it from a present value to future value of money perspective, keep the inflation target in mind, (2% is considered a healthy economy) and available interest rates on high yield savings accounts. (Not great currently) I would look for dividend rates over 3% to see that money maintain/build it's value over time when compared with other investment opportunities. (This is also why bonds might as well be dead)

2. New product with better tech and for a lower cost coming out in the next 30-45 days
3. Doing a dual PR release with a NYSE chain retailer soon
4. Just announced no reverse split in the near future
5. Been waiting for FDA approval on over the counter hearing aids... law was passed in 2017 to sell and FDA was suppose to approve in 2020, but covid. Wrote a letter at the start of 2021 and expected to hear in the next few weeks.

Yes, of course, but if comes with this game. If you want safe and sound “investments”. Invest in long term growth stuff not penny stocks.

456,AM," I trade small cap, momentum plays (long) and am usually done by 9:30 AM Pacific. I set a slightly wide stop loss for protection and I use my discretion. As soon as I see the stock not doing what it ..was.. doing, I exit. Cut losses quickly. I never ever hold over night. That's suicide. As far as losses I don't risk anything I can't afford. And what's great about playing hot ""of the day"" gainers is that the reward is usually pretty high, if not 2:1, maybe 3:1 or more.

When these Pennystocks are done moving for whichever pop up on my screener for the day, it's over. Usually they tank the next few days, some run up maybe halfway then tank again. No potential to really call those secondary or third moves. I see them moving on my screener and I look at the chart, if it looks somewhat safe, I jump on for the ride. And I take profits ..early.

Don't hold them. Don't trust them. Don't invest in them.

Interesting note I think is when I'm on a roll, I increase the size of my trades slightly, and when I'm losing like mad, I decrease my trade size or don't trade.

514,KODK," Shorting would be borrowing stocks, sell, then try to buy back cheaper to repay it. So for instance, KODK went up to $60 at a high back in July 29. I could try to borrow say 100 shares from my broker and sell those 100 shares right away for $60 each giving me $6000. Now I would hope that KODK drops to a lower price, which it did, to buy back the 100 shares I owe. KODK then drops to about $6 per share on August 27. So now I can buy back the 100 shares at $6 a piece coming out to $600. I would then have profited $6000 - $600 = $5400.

536,ANY," It doesn't matter what the company does. Or whatever. This stock has been consistently selling off for a bit now. I don't see ANY reason to buy it. It's not doing anything. It's fading.

The time you want to buy these stocks is when they are GAINING, rapidly. They will pop up on a Gain screener like Finviz (website.)

You play the first day, long, jump in, hold for maybe 10 minutes, playing the momentum, and then get the heck out and never buy the stock again, unless it dips during the first breakout day and goes for a second relay.

After that the play is usually over. I don't know why people are ""investing"" in Pennystocks. These are one hitter quitters.

Find the next HOT GAINER and trade that one instead.
