17,AMC," There is absolutely no evidence to suggest that retailers were the major winners in the majority of these trades, or that the majority of the profits from GME‚Äôs explosion has benefited retailers. The majority of the gains have assuredly gone to other hedge funds or asset managers.

* Robinhood began to restrict trade on Thursday **\[GME January 28th, 2021 $265.00 | $193.60\]**, but retail investors were actually [net sellers of GME](https://imgur.com/a/tkBAuyI) on Tuesday **\[GME January 26th, $88.56 | $147.98\]** and Wednesday **\[GME September 12th, 2019 $354.83 | $347.51\]**. To quote the following from Matt Levine of Bloomberg, ‚ÄúWhat do you make of that? One reading would be: ‚ÄúRetail investors on Reddit might have started the GameStop rally, but they‚Äôre not piling into this stock now, and the price action this week is coming from professionals.‚Äù Or as one Twitter user put it, ‚Äúpast the retail ignition, the rocket ship was mostly intra-fast money warfare.‚Äù This story doesn‚Äôt exactly tell you who the professionals are, whether they‚Äôre traditional Wall Street (hedge funds, etc.) or algorithmic high-frequency traders or just semiprofessional crews of day-traders who don‚Äôt access the market through traditional retail brokers. Someone other than Robinhood traders, anyway.‚Äù
* Other Hedge Funds made massive gains on this stock. Senvest, a hedge fund run by Richard Mashall and Brian Gonick, owned about 5% of GameStop by the end of **\[GME October 15th, 2020 $14.03 | $13.86\]** October. They made nearly [$700m profit](https://www.wsj.com/articles/this-hedge-fund-made-700-million-on-gamestop-11612390687) on selling their GameStop holdings. Another fund, Mudrick Capital Management LP, made almost $200m on AMC in January.
* Hedge funds alone [owned nearly](https://hedgefollow.com/stocks/GME) ([archive](https://i.imgur.com/hoaJk0T.png)) 15m shares of the available 51m float for GameStop at the end of 2020.
* Five huge asset managers, FMR LLC, Blackrock Inc., and Vanguard Group Inc., Morgan Stanley and Dimensional Fund Advisors also[ owned around](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/institutional-holdings) ([archive](https://i.imgur.com/3nvja6Z.png)) 24.5m shares between the five of them at the end of 2020. The Ontario teacher‚Äôs pension fund also [scooped up](https://scoop.upworthy.com/ontario-teachers-pension-fund-gains-500-million-cashing-in-gamestop-stock-rebellion) an easy $500m.

**Someone else wrote a** [**GameStop Manifesto**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nFKt9Vd7bYsVSCIDwbXxrtUFTuJEFJbiOpEAgc2uw5k/edit)**, covering everything from start to finish. Endless amounts of misinformation being spread and pushed by politicians, influencers and alt media with clear agendas. Take your time to go through this to have a true understanding of what actually happened.**

""All of the relevant financial terms one needs to understand in order to have a decent grasp of these topics can be learned in a couple of hours, tops, yet it seems that not one, single, alternative media creator took the time to read up on any basic finance. Large creators with millions of followers including Kyle Kulinski, Tim Pool, Hasan Piker, Vaush, TheStockGuy, Steven Crowder, and influential politicians such as Ted Cruz, AOC and Ilhan Omar, and thousands of smaller ‚Äúpolitical‚Äù and ‚Äúfinance‚Äù channels on both YouTube and Twitch, and even some people who should know better like Elon Musk, Mark Cuban and Chamath Palihapitiya were so hungry to shove their ideological narrative into this situation that they abdicated the great responsibility they have when it comes to informing their audiences.

Aside from the propagation of misinformation, this is a very rare media frenzy that had the ability to directly and negatively harm audiences because it drove them to throw their money away on a garbage gamble, expecting a massive payout near the end. ( [1](https://i.imgur.com/Tb0FOhw.jpg) | [2](https://imgur.com/a/xN3aMNl) | [3](https://www.reddit.com/gallery/lbxn76) | [4](https://i.imgur.com/4VMXhiC.png) | [5](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-55948550) | [6](https://www.pcgamer.com/after-gamestops-share-price-plummets-reddits-wallstreetbets-investors-are-hurting/) | [7](https://www.businessinsider.com/addicted-to-robinhood-wallstreetbets-day-trading-lost-everything-2021-2?IR=T) | [8](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EugXH9yXcAEUUG3?format=jpg&name=large) ). Many large content creators including LinusTechTips and H3H3 either spread the ‚Äúdiamond hands‚Äù meme or showed themselves buying into the stock, undoubtedly driving their viewers to do so as well. It‚Äôs impossible to document the myriad of stories of people negatively impacted by this, and r/wallstreetbet deleting a lot of the negative stories continues to misrepresent the narrative as ‚Äúretail winning big against the hedge funds.‚Äù

It‚Äôs unfortunate that so much hate and vitriol is directed towards members of the finance community and mainstream media when the alternative media got this situation ubiquitously incorrect, sometimes in embarrassing ways. It‚Äôs obvious that there was a political narrative to be spun here, but this was done almost entirely to the benefit of the content creators and politicians spinning the narrative and to the detriment of both the public discourse and the victims who were goaded into buying this stock. It‚Äôs also unfortunate because there are very real criticisms that could be levied towards the financial industry in regards to this situation (Perhaps no commission trading is irresponsible? Perhaps gamifying investment apps is tantamount to gambling? Perhaps margin requirements should increase as short interest increases?), but we won‚Äôt hear any of it. Instead, it will be a barrage of baseless claims by uneducated entertainers lamenting about the ‚Äúunfairness‚Äù of the world of finance, despite them not understanding anything they‚Äôre talking about beyond the basic definition of a short sale.

I am also incredibly disappointed in media consumers. Over and over again, people on both the left and right say they wish they had more factual media, and less sensationalist reporting. And yet, over and over again, you, the consumer, prove yourselves wrong. The majority of consumers are just interested in the most sensationalized piece of media they can find that conforms to their pre-existing political beliefs.

I hope, at the very least, that anyone who‚Äôs listened to me review this document or talk about it on video will have a slightly better understanding of the underlying mechanisms at play here, but I won‚Äôt hold my breath."" - from the GameStop Manifesto",ye4ye,13,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lowgx3/recovery_incoming/go87xyb/,0.068,0.832,0.1,0.9834

His analysis was based on the idea that its stock was priced for near term bankruptcy and he thought it would last beyond the near term at the minimum and was right. He even talks about how he still expects them to likely fail going forward he just doesnt think its in the next 5 years so its a value play til then or at least it was when he made his analysis on 4$ GME not 40$.

But as a long term investment the analysis is dogshit, its built upon assumptions like Gamestop just straight up taking over incredibly difficult niches in the gaming space and doing it based on nothing but hopes and dreams and then somehow making those niches into ultra profitable sectors.

Like for one it talks about the gaming industries growth as a sign that Gamestop (a gaming retailer) will also grow with it.

It ignores that Gamestop business however is shrinking significantly and they are far too late to transition to the digital space and in many case literally cant (walled garden storefronts that are straight up blocking 3rd party resellers like Gamestop). It also ignores that the digital space is incredibly competitive with companies that have REAL brand loyalty already reside and Gamestop is a known negative brand.

So why does the industry getting larger matter to Gamestop when the revenue is straight up going in the exact opposite direction of their specific business?

Like part of his analysis is based on digital media transition being overblown but this year was staggeringly digital focused and Sony and Microsoft straight up are now selling consoles without disc drives which completely cuts Gamestop out.

This also ignores that second hand markets are easier than ever to utilize. Gamestop made much of its money on 2nd hand upsells where their margins were huge. Now that market is far more crowded with Amazon/Best Buy/Target/Walmart/Ect. all offering trade ins and also the fact that Facebook and many other apps now facilitate easy person to person sales which are far better for both the seller and buyer cutting out the middle man that is companies like Gamestop.

At the end he even boils it down to the fact that he clearly knows Hedge Funds are trying to execute incredibly risky shorts on the company and is looking mainly to exploit that. He straight up ends his analysis essentially saying he thinks the company is still in serious trouble but thinks it will outlast these bets that it will be bankrupt by a certain date and is willing to counter bet on it.

45,EA," >Well, it isn't just hopes & dreams. The idea is that with a few key new hires and some effectively negotiated partnerships, along with the cash infusion from their overall stock price rise, they could spin up at least one new division focused more on things like digital delivery and streamers.

But it doesnt just work that way, you cant just toss money and poof it works. The digital delivery market is UNBELIEVABLY oversaturated right now for games and people want LESS storefronts not more.

So not only is the market not welcoming to new competitors its also flooded with way more imposing companies.

Companies that can crush Gamestop with their wallets and are willing to do so to maintain control.

Look at how hard Microsoft is failing on the digital storefront and they are just flooding that division with money. They also have exclusive games and content to bait people into using their service and people STILL wont do it if given the choice.

And Gamestop has none of that, they dont have exclusives they develop in house, they dont have the cash to buy said exclusives compared to others in the market, and they sure as hell dont have the reputation to pull people in without those incentives.

And Streamers? Really? I mean come on this is literally something every company does and it doesnt just flip a switch to success nor work.

Look at how much money Microsoft tossed at the biggest streamers on the planet to pump up their streaming platform and that still didnt move the needle in the slightest.

And again, their reputation is BAD, like REALLY FUCKING BAD.

I get that we are memeing here with regards to GME and its resurrection but as far as a brand goes Gamestop is reviled.

And by the way, not just reviled by consumers but Developers alike, they fucking hate how Gamestop pushed used sales that completely cut them out. Which is why you saw so many developers straight up talking about one time sale codes (these actually existed in EA games for a time) that you had to activate to play and couldnt resell afterwards. These guys are not going to line up to ""help gamestop out"" when Gamestop had no problem twisting the dagger when they were in the power position and real exclusivity deals are available from better companies with much deeper pockets.

>They need a pile of money to happen, but the money by itself isn't everything, and sometimes it will come along anyway if you're making cool things happen.

Thats the thing though, they are not making cool things happen. The suggested business pivots people are throwing out there are just copys of successful current businesses lol.

>Everything from Apple to Tesla started out as mostly just hopes & dreams + a whole lot of ambition.

Gamestop isn't some upstart, they were a billion dollar retailer that gouged the fuck out of its consumers and vendors.

46,GME," >Well, it isn't just hopes & dreams. The idea is that with a few key new hires and some effectively negotiated partnerships, along with the cash infusion from their overall stock price rise, they could spin up at least one new division focused more on things like digital delivery and streamers.

But it doesnt just work that way, you cant just toss money and poof it works. The digital delivery market is UNBELIEVABLY oversaturated right now for games and people want LESS storefronts not more.

So not only is the market not welcoming to new competitors its also flooded with way more imposing companies.

Companies that can crush Gamestop with their wallets and are willing to do so to maintain control.

Look at how hard Microsoft is failing on the digital storefront and they are just flooding that division with money. They also have exclusive games and content to bait people into using their service and people STILL wont do it if given the choice.

And Gamestop has none of that, they dont have exclusives they develop in house, they dont have the cash to buy said exclusives compared to others in the market, and they sure as hell dont have the reputation to pull people in without those incentives.

And Streamers? Really? I mean come on this is literally something every company does and it doesnt just flip a switch to success nor work.

Look at how much money Microsoft tossed at the biggest streamers on the planet to pump up their streaming platform and that still didnt move the needle in the slightest.

And again, their reputation is BAD, like REALLY FUCKING BAD.

I get that we are memeing here with regards to GME and its resurrection but as far as a brand goes Gamestop is reviled.

And by the way, not just reviled by consumers but Developers alike, they fucking hate how Gamestop pushed used sales that completely cut them out. Which is why you saw so many developers straight up talking about one time sale codes (these actually existed in EA games for a time) that you had to activate to play and couldnt resell afterwards. These guys are not going to line up to ""help gamestop out"" when Gamestop had no problem twisting the dagger when they were in the power position and real exclusivity deals are available from better companies with much deeper pockets.

>They need a pile of money to happen, but the money by itself isn't everything, and sometimes it will come along anyway if you're making cool things happen.

Thats the thing though, they are not making cool things happen. The suggested business pivots people are throwing out there are just copys of successful current businesses lol.

>Everything from Apple to Tesla started out as mostly just hopes & dreams + a whole lot of ambition.

Gamestop isn't some upstart, they were a billion dollar retailer that gouged the fuck out of its consumers and vendors. They are not breaking into some unknown groundbreaking business, they are 10 years late on these markets and now as they flame out hope they can somehow survive the transition and hope it works.

110,AMZN," The answer is to sell wayyyy out of the money calls using ridiculously high leverage to 99.99999% guarantee a profit. Say, go sell 10 OTM calls on AMZN at 3700 for $125 each expiring in 5 days for a grand total of $1250. So you make $1250 so long as AMZN doesn't increase by 13.8% this week, which given there's no earnings I would put the probability at close to zero. The downside is if AMZN does rise above 3700 to let's say 3750 you're out $48,750. If it goes to 3800 you're out $98,750. But how likely is a 1.6  trillion dollar company going to jump 14% in 5 days?

114,IMO," Yeah I agree the establishment didn‚Äôt want Bernie. And I know Bloomberg‚Äôs primary goal was keeping Bernie from getting the nomination. But watching it play out, Bloomberg seemed to think he could actually get the nomination because he thought Biden‚Äôs campaign was falling apart rather than solely hurting Bernie and boosting Biden. And when you look at the polls at that time, Biden‚Äôs drop in the polls mirrors exactly Bloomberg‚Äôs rise. In fact it wasn‚Äôt until Bloomberg broke double digits that Biden fell below Bernie. 

TLDR, Bloomberg did solely want to beat Bernie, but didn‚Äôt do so by taking votes from him, actually intended to do so by taking votes from the moderate candidates. 

Warren was what really did Bernie in IMO.

117,TV," We managed to switch the MIL over from cable whilst we were living with her, hooked her up with a smart tv, Netflix and Prime, spent painstaking hours teaching her how to use it herself and then ditched the cable and downgraded her to what is known as 'freeview' in the UK, which is the free TV channels everyone gets, and mostly includes the TV channels she was watching anyway. The only thing she's lost is the ability to record TV shows, but the box was 99% filled with shows her late husband recorded a few years ago and she couldn't bring herself to watch or delete. We offered to torrent all the shows for her so she'd still be able to watch them if she wanted, which she declined and then realised that she was paying to keep a bunch of shit she didn't want to watch saved on a box.

She's saving a buttload every year now and has more shows at her disposal than she can shake a stick at, including loads in her native language, which she'd never get on the paid cable.

Funnily enough, the main reason she was worried about ditching cable is that it was bundled with her phone/internet plan and she was worried about losing or changing her phone plan as it's set up so she can call her overseas relatives at no extra charge. We never got far enough to teach her and the rest of the family to use the internet to communicate, unfortunately, some habits die hard.  


A lot of boomers are just so out of touch that they are too scared to mess with things and keep paying the price.  


We also shopped around and got her a better deal on her electricity and gas rates, as she had been with the same provider for years, assuming that her *loyalty* and the household name of the provider meant she was getting the best deal.

147,JP," ...CCIM is a designation.

So let me get this straight, your DD is:

* That an analyst, and a leasing manager share the same credential and that they're right next to each other on a list that's sorted alphabetically. (Their last names are both Morris... Huh.)

* That Melvin Capital used GS as a prime broker (They also used Morgan Stanley) which is somehow suspicious, even though GS one of the largest prime brokers. (Side note: It's funny to see that Melvin got rekt going long on that, now bankrupt, company.)

* Some random analyst from JMP also has the CCIM designation.

And somehow this all comes back to insider information being traded between the three parties, and then to Melvin Capital? (Not explained)

Edit:

Okay, here's the smoking gun. You say Christopher Morris could have leaked info to short GameStop in 2014?

175,AI," By the way. For better research practices, when studying a topic, you need to figure out what is *normal* in the topic, and what is an *unusual connection*. 

For instance: Yellen had given a speech at a financial company. 

&#x200B;

This connection is entirely normal. She worked as the fed chair for the past half decade. She is a 74 year old economist. 

&#x200B;

That is a completely normal affair to have happened. However, if, for instance, you had Yellen going around and giving speeches at cutting edge physics foundations and being paid for it, *that is unusual*. The same would be true in the reverse, but not always as true. It is very common to see compsci professionals cross-ranging different topics, for instance, especially with AI. Thus, someone like Bill Gates- also taking the capital he can throw around and his general influence- may well be normal just about everywhere except a luddite convention.

&#x200B;

Then ask yourself the question: is it normal to be paid when, perhaps, I am qualified to speak at this or that event, and doing so takes up my time in both travel and effort to perform, especially to a crowd who necessarily wants to hear from (me), the fed chair for years, and lifetime economist. 

That is an extreme case that led to Citadel gaining weird correlations as everyone scrambled to find reasons to hate everyone with a name involved. It should not be surprising that economists fuck.

196,AMC," GME Real Estate is closing stores, but not because they are going bankrupt. When GameStop bought out competitors they left the competing stores open. A lot of malls had two GameStop store locations, hell even my bumfuck nowhere town had two stores. 

Cohen asked them to close brick and mortar locations because in many cases the amount of physical stores in one location is plain silly. Management has been really dropping the ball in this area, they even purchased *another* company that did mobile sales which further compounded the real estate problem.

True - I think Ryan Cohen's involvement was a Hail Mary attempt to pivot from a terribly mismanaged situation, and they had real worries about going bankrupt. BUT, unlike AMC they did not do a share offering in response to the squeeze. If they were about to go bankrupt raising capital would have been a priority.

Robinhood did not have the capital to secure the funds at risk because they were undercapitalized. Robinhood had thousands if not millions of people buying GME on margin which put them in a higher risk category. Technically in the eyes of the law robinhood did what they had to do, whether or not there was nefarious reasoning for the increase in capital requirements for funds at risk knowing robinhood could not pay is a different matter though.

250,GME," They could be lying, or more likely exaggerating the extent of there shorts...HF shorting is routine,  nobody holds on to shorts for 7 years, it's on-again off-again cyclical strategy.  What they may have been doing is routinely shorting oscillation.  I look at GME an it trades at \~40 starting in June 2013 and continues until Oct 2015 declining to   \~25 in 2017, maybe he has a crystal ball, but I think he was obfuscating.

"" the investor may wish to hold on to the short for as long as he or she maintains the opposing long position, or at least until he or she no longer considers the long position to be in danger of significant decline. ""

He's not telling the whole story.  If hedging is to balance your risk, then you would have a long position commensurate with your shorts for insurance.

The only reason that I can think of, why someone would take an extreme ""naked short ""position is that they have some insider knowledge, that guaranteed them a lock on profits.... what they did not see coming, and nobody did was a bunch of normal (maybe abnormal) fucking people finding the chink in there armor,  pulling a short squeeze. If indeed GME is 440% oversold with synthetic shares, and if you believe what some of these HF Managers were saying ""this could have wrecked the financial system"" then it means these assholes have really rigged the system.

If I were you(I am not. I am not a financial advisor), I‚Äôd Buy OTMs on those drops at discount, flip them the following day/week after it rebounds and use profits for more shares. On peaks, but ITM puts, use those as leverage to either flip into profit and buy more shares, or hedge your share count.

I am just gonna copy paste from another post I made because I am too lazy to rephrase it for this post. In short, I would defend Robinhood if I have to. Here what i written in another post:

Honestly  speaking, I was a little disappointed with the 5 hours hearing last  week. I feel like 80% of the questions were targeting Robinhood and  frankly, they are quite 'innocent'. The whole thing started with  Melvin/Citadel and potential other hedgefund 'illegally' shorting a  company and they were caught with their hands in the jar.

Robinhood  is just a platform who unfortunately got stuck between everybody and if  you are looking from the perspective of who has the most financial gain  or whatsoever, Robinhood is the biggest loser of all in this GME saga:  they lost significant trust from their customers, brand damage, IPO  potentially hurt and so much more while gaining nothing. Sometimes what  you see is not what you think it is. Let's not forget other platforms  did the exact same thing RH did though they were able to recover quicker  probably because they have far less user than RH (thus requiring  significantly less collateral).

Long story short, **I would defend Robinhood** (you like it or not, their platform is so much easier and intuitive to use when compared to others). **The  focus of the hearing should have been the naked shorting by Melvin and  the transaction mechanism between Cidatel and the clearing house.**

The questioning from the real police, the real forensics,  the people like you and me who work a 9-5 job trying to help others, there will be hell to pay.

Police seem to get a lot of disrespect, but trust me there's a lot of crime out there, and there aren't enough cops to stop it all, and not enough money to get enough cops, and when there are enough cops people will scream AUTHORITARIANISM, STOP! So their situation is not as black and white as people make it out to be. They get an early retirement here, sure, but they also fairly often get shot and killed before reaching that age, so there's that to consider too.

The interviews are not short, they go on as long as they need to, and they are exactly as you'd see in any cop drama.

Good cop, bad cop, legal threats, convincing, using evidence to prove that they are lying, a refusal to receive ""When I was a boy in bulgaria"" to a yes or no question. I'm sure during an official interview, such an action would be highly dangerous for the suspect to parrot, just like that other fellow's conflicting statements too.

This governmental hearing is preliminary, public.

When there is enough reason, the real cops would be sent in to collect  evidence, and you will not have a clue what is going on, when, or where.

Then it goes to a court. When the police believe they truly can catch the bastards with what they have written down and collected.

This is the point where people jump out of windows, sell off their shorts, and shit hits the fan, not right now. When the police demand evidence of the company's financial stock transactions from wherever, and the company (Melvin/Citadel/etc) data doesn't add up, or is missing key months/days of data.

405,UK," I just want to say, if a criminal investigation is started into these guys (and it should be).

The questioning from the real police, the real forensics,  the people like you and me who work a 9-5 job trying to help others, there will be hell to pay.

Police seem to get a lot of disrespect, but trust me there's a lot of crime out there, and there aren't enough cops to stop it all, and not enough money to get enough cops, and when there are enough cops people will scream AUTHORITARIANISM, STOP! So their situation is not as black and white as people make it out to be. They get an early retirement here, sure, but they also fairly often get shot and killed before reaching that age, so there's that to consider too.

The interviews are not short, they go on as long as they need to, and they are exactly as you'd see in any cop drama.

Good cop, bad cop, legal threats, convincing, using evidence to prove that they are lying, a refusal to receive ""When I was a boy in bulgaria"" to a yes or no question. I'm sure during an official interview, such an action would be highly dangerous for the suspect to parrot, just like that other fellow's conflicting statements too.

This governmental hearing is preliminary, public.

When there is enough reason, the real cops would be sent in to collect  evidence, and you will not have a clue what is going on, when, or where.

Then it goes to a court. When the police believe they truly can catch the bastards with what they have written down and collected.

This is the point where people jump out of windows, sell off their shorts, and shit hits the fan, not right now. When the police demand evidence of the company's financial stock transactions from wherever, and the company (Melvin/Citadel/etc) data doesn't add up, or is missing key months/days of data.

KEY TAKEAWAYS

* Both short selling and buying put options are bearish strategies that become more profitable as the market drops.
* Short selling involves the sale of a security not owned by the seller but borrowed and then sold in the market, to be bought back later, with potential for large losses if the market moves up.
* Buying a put option gives the buyer the right to sell the underlying asset at a price stated in the option, with the maximum loss being the premium paid for the option.
* Both short sales and put options have risk-reward profiles that may not make them suitable for novice investors.",u_w_i_n,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/loleca/robinhoods_ceo_vlad_tenev_had_to_give_up_shares/go8k5dk/,0.068,0.876,0.056,-0.3619

On the other side, maybe just 1 or 2 republican senators seemed to take it seriously. The others asked softball questions or just attacked the hearing in general. Granted, I'll give the republicans one thing, that they seemed to understand what was going on much better even if they refused to truly try to dig down.

They wanted yes and no answers to complicated things that need clarification. Almost like asking a guy who killed someone else in self defense ""did you kill person X, yes or no"".

On the other side, even on questions where yes or no should have been sufficient, Vlad dodged like a pro.

Citadel dodged explaining exactly if they provided the exact same execution for similar orders regardless of where it came from, and I can't remember if he was ever asked how he benefited from PFOF, but he never explained.

456,GME," In all fairness if you watch the [cut of her questioning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_s1_mOWoHVM), you'll see that the unmute came at exactly the 5 minute mark.

She was way more prepared than her colleagues, but wasting 2 minutes on PFOF, and dancing around margin buying requirements for customers i truly think wasn't a very good use of her time (PFOF has been around for 2 decades, RH just used it to the maximum). Bad order fills, EVERYONE that i know who trades regularly knows RH has always been the literal bottom of the order execution ladder.

Maybe more stringent margin requirements would have reduced the amount of trading on RH for GME  in general, or might just have delayed it as more people added cash to their account.

IMO, her first question got to the heart of the issue when she was pointing out how they didn't manage their internal risk, but then she delved off into margin and margin rates which again was a waste of time (imo).

Her questions seemed more directed at RH's general business model as opposed to anything that would help shed light on the GME situation. And maybe that's the point of the whole thing, use this to finally prove RH is incompetent and to an extent underhanded in its regular business practices.

All that said, my favorite was  the dude from Ohio who brought up how potentially using a chain of blocks (have to obfuscate the name from automod) and not needing the behemoth of DTCC (or at least not to its current capacity) was quite interesting, and showed a dude that wasnt' just chilling.",username--_--,39,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/loleca/robinhoods_ceo_vlad_tenev_had_to_give_up_shares/go7f6to/,0.093,0.845,0.062,-0.8701

You keep your mouth shut so the prosecution can't seize on something you say as a sign of guilt, because they will be all too happy to twist reality into some weird conspiracy theory to get a conviction.

I even had some for 2/19 at $50, which I closed out on 2/12 (did not want to wait another week to find out the price does not go down) and lost on those about $10K. Could have held till the 19th and with the price decrease (finally) would have reduced my losses by about $10K overall.

I think the Puts was not a bad idea to buy, but I at least recognized I was fighting an irrational army of hodlers and definitely was not going to YOLO on that.

Think of it this way, when a stock bottomed how much lower can it go? Most gamblers at that stage are thinking what a trash stock, can't rally at all. But that's exactly the right place you want to buy in when it's unloved. 

Like PLTR for eg. When it plunged consecutively for 6days in a row from 38 down to 27, that's when you buy in. Wood bought at 27. When it crash again to 25, she bought even more. That's the way to dig yourself out. But when the fear is absolutely brutal. Don't buy when it rocket to $45. That's when you should be considering taking profit. 

AAPL is another. It seems to be forming a base right now and while narrative is bad, I wouldn't be surprised if this is a short term bottom and it retests $145 within the next few weeks.

Rebuild and maybe next time don't go 100% into options like a complete degenerate. I made maybe double what I lost last year by correctly playing GME but I was much more conservative this time-buying cheap shares mostly and only using a small amount of options. Maybe not the maximum returns but managing your risk is more important, and I only put maybe 10% of my liquid assets into the play.

So you still think it's all a big coincidence do you? Well let me tell you that Beethoven wrote piano sonata no. 23 in F minor... F MINOR!! The F minor scale contains 4 half notes. If you take 33 x 4, that would make 132. You might recognize that number? On Feb. 8 GME had a SI of 132% of float.

554,DD," Although OP did an absolutely fantastic job of describing the situation, I feel like I can make my own contribution:  


It is known to everyone in my line of work that when planning these trades quantum mechanics come into play due to the enormous balls of the person trading. Hence the deformation of spacetime caused by said supermassive balls will have to be accounted for when calculating entry and exit points from the trade. Updating the data above gives us the result that, at this rate, the sun will undergo a gamma squeeze and see a rapid price growth in the next 69.420 days. Furthermore, upon such squeeze happening, mars will be in conjuction with the Earth, prompting Elon Musk to launch his colonization mission on that same day. This will cause a negative sentiment momentum and help OP in driving the price down. Once the price is low enough, the subsequent economic crisis will prompt for some americans to make pizza with ketchup, which will cause Italy to invade the US and conquer its territory using pasta and collusion with the local mafia (which are, as we all know, undercover Italian secret service agents). Upon doing this, $PIZZA will skyrocket prompting many to invest in the stonk but to no avail, because the HFs will try and sell even more fake, non-italian, pizzas prompting for a nuclear holocaust of the world's economy.

Thank me later for the DD.

I keep averaging down like this using 10% of my account at every level down. At some point, the stock obviously bounces back . . . and I sell.

That, mathematically, the short squeeze was inevitable once momentum began because the price would continue to rise while available shares would continue to drop.  It's simple supply and demand, but for *shares*, and only the inability to purchase more could stop the squeeze.  I assume you wanted to buy more but could not.

Ask if they understand that high short interest can drive down stock price, and that can result in negative sentiment causing a spiral that can bankrupt a company.  And if that happens, those who shorted the stock are not required to pay taxes on any losses.  Sounds like a good reason to drive the price into the ground, right?  At what, the cost of an under-performing company that was probably going out of business anyway?  I wonder if the billion-dollar market makers have the ability to cause such downward trends. 

Ask if they understand that Citadel handles the majority of Robinhood's order flow.  Ask if they think that might be a conflict of interest if Citadel has a large position in a stock that has a massive uptick in activity that might adversely affect their bet.

Ask if they are aware that these companies have paid multiple fines for illicit behavior.  Which are miniscule in comparison to revenue, to the point that it could easily be absorbed as the cost of doing business.

Tell them about the how reported short interest in GME dropped greatly on Jan 28th, but miraculously skyrocketed in a retail ETF, of which... GME is the primary holding, on the same day.  And by the way, the most recent short interest reports were submitted *late*.
 
Something, something... 5:11 AM phone call, 3-billion in capital, DTCC waiving requirements.  (I haven't really read into that) 

Tell them there are a lot of things that don't seem to add up, and that you're excited to learn more about how the the corruption between Robinhood, Melvin, Citadel and the DTCC will be investigated.  I assume you will be watching the series of congressional hearings from the House Committee on Financial Services?

I may not be 100% accurate on terms and whatnot, and I'm sure people will correct me, but you should call it out for what it is rather than *hurr, durrr... ape go to moon*.

692,DD," You mentioned before staying away from WSB which I think is smart because the community has grown large and splintered enough that one person can't really speak for all unless they do extensive anthropological research on it.

IF I were to talk about WSB I'd agree that it's a place that feels on the edge of things. It is not for everyone, but it's always trying to find interesting things and often succeeding. The incredible DD that are diamonds in the rough over here and the truly interesting discussions an deep explanations about financial systems are more fun and interesting than anywhere else.

What I would focus on is the imbalance of power that has been happening that we have no control over and no power to protect ourselves against while large hedge funds do. The whole idea that Citadel was able to 'invest' in Melvin Capital and also is the largest revenue stream to Robinhood (which got a 1 billion dollar investment after the whole ordeal which kind of sounds like being paid for being the fall guy in this situation). It's kind of ridiculous and sure, MAYBE Citadel is really 2 companies (clearing house and hedge fund) and maybe the two are in NO way connected (except for name), but... it's a great windfall for them to have two companies that can influence both side of the market so that both those companies get out ahead.

Things like that.

One thing that has been bothering me is this narrative about the hyper-inflated value of GME caused by retail investors.  In the end, the only thing that matters in the ‚Äúvalue‚Äù of anything is demand.  The shorts manufactured downward pressure on the stock resulting in manufacturing potential upward pressure on the stock.

723,PII," These are the key aspects I'd like congress to consider implementing. Not trade taxation but policies that make the market fair.

1: Curtailing predatory share lending practices. 

You see all these posts to turn off share lending but why are there all these hoops we have to jump through to turn them off in the first place? The ones who benefit from this are brokerages and not the customers they're supposed to serve. Share lending should only be possible with express written consent of the shareholder, exact knowledge of the income generated by share lending, and the shareholder being the majority profiter of this lending practice.

2: Failure to Deliver punishment and enforcement.

FTDs are bad for a multitude of reasons and can even be strategically employed by hedge funds to gain profits which is against the very nature of fair and equitable transactions and yet the SEC does nothing about it. There needs to be harsh and actually enforced punishments by the SEC for FTDs.

3: Total Market Transparency

We should know, without revealing PII, where the shares are owned and how much by every entity in the market on a weekly or at worst, monthly basis. We shouldn't have to guess how many shares of X stock are owned by retail, institutions, brokerages, funds, etc. We shouldn't have to guess if the reported short interest is truthful or not. It should all be collectively reported and up to date at a macro level.

You are confusing the excess premium charge which DTCC waived  and the total deposit amount, which was still elevated and required the $700m cash infusion

> 3. Citadel, you‚Äôve had adequate time sense out last questioning to verify if someone at Citadel was in direct contact with Robinhood regarding GME and AMC directly. Was any current or prior employee, contractor or fulltime, in contact with Robinhood directly regarding these tickers?

lol, and what do you expect them to say ""yup, you caught us""?

> 7. Vlad, free and efficient markets would dictate that if there were ever a moment in which stock needed to be paused, it would have been paused for both buying and selling and that options contracts would be adjusted for time. Why was this not your approach?

Ask yourself the outrage the sub would have felt if RH paused GME altogether while every other brokerage was trading, and by the time they unpaused it, GME was at $100.

> 6. Vlad, Why did you restrict buying of shares and options when you could have made restrictions on options alone to satisfy what you claim were increased margin requirements. When someone has cash to purchase shares that are not on margin why restrict them?

Increased margin requirements isn't the margin that you and i buy shares with, it is the deposit that RH has to give to DTCC for every **net** GME buy. Essentially something of a collateral to ensure that if anything happened to RH, some money would at least go to the seller. Usually the deposit required per net GME buy was 1-2%, but reportedly due to the volatility, DTCC required 100%.

They cannot use client money for that (since your money is being routed to the seller), they have to use their own money.

Ask yourself the outrage the sub would have felt if RH paused GME altogether while every other brokerage was trading, and by the time they unpaused it, GME was at $100.

> 6. Vlad, Why did you restrict buying of shares and options when you could have made restrictions on options alone to satisfy what you claim were increased margin requirements. When someone has cash to purchase shares that are not on margin why restrict them?

Increased margin requirements isn't the margin that you and i buy shares with, it is the deposit that RH has to give to DTCC for every **net** GME buy. Essentially something of a collateral to ensure that if anything happened to RH, some money would at least go to the seller. Usually the deposit required per net GME buy was 1-2%, but reportedly due to the volatility, DTCC required 100%.

They cannot use client money for that (since your money is being routed to the seller), they have to use their own money.

736,GME," Honestly speaking, I was a little disappointed with the 5 hours hearing last week. I feel like 80% of the questions were targeting Robinhood and frankly, they are quite 'innocent'. The whole thing started with Melvin/Citadel and potential other hedgefund 'illegally' shorting a company and they were caught with their hands in the jar.

Robinhood is just a platform who unfortunately got stuck between everybody and if you are looking from the perspective of who has the most financial gain or whatsoever, Robinhood is the biggest loser of all in this GME saga: they lost significant trust from their customers, brand damage, IPO potentially hurt and so much more while gaining nothing. Sometimes what you see is not what you think it is. Let's not forget other platforms did the exact same thing RH did though they were able to recover quicker probably because they have far less user than RH (thus requiring significantly less collateral).

Long story short, **I would defend Robinhood** (you like it or not, their platform is so much easier and intuitive to use when compared to others). **The focus of the hearing should have been the naked shorting by Melvin and the transaction mechanism between Cidatel and the clearing house.**

Housing prices are inflated but once you get out of the bigger cities the price of land and the cost to build is still a fraction. I've talked to realtors that say people are actually having bidding wars on homes and properties, selling for 5 to 10% over asking price in some cases. Rates are at an all time low but you still have to have impeccable credit and excellent debt to income ratio to get a low rate, so in most cases the lenders are still making out like bandits.

Example: 

-	You have a call credit spread on stock ABC. 110/111
-	Stock ABC trading at 100 before Earnings
-	A predictable Earnings move is +-10%, so 110/90

923,TV," >That whole episode did nothing but damage the cruise industry for the sake of fear-based politics.

People get sick a lot of cruises, and cruise ships are an ancient repurposed industry that uses the dirtiest fuels and skirts international law to stay profitable. They aren't even popular for being a good product, but because boomers watched their boomer TV shows with cruise ships in them and decided pleasure cruises were a status symbol and legitimate vacation.

I don't see how being trapped at sea with every square foot of deck space flooded with people (those wide open decks in the ads don't exist) is a good product.  If they want to revive an ancient vacation business that doesn't need to exist, they should bring back luxury passenger trains. Everyone loves trains, but cruise ships emerged from a long line of giant rat-infested disease-riddled misery vessels that make no sense as a vacation destination.",RobertTheAdventurer,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lp03yz/oc_this_is_how_boomers_invest/go9nmq2/,0.132,0.709,0.159,0.6303

The problem, is not the ideology, I think the problem is that in business it is hard enough as things are to make ANY money, and when a company stops focusing on that and making other things a priority, it is the beginning of the end for it. 

I, and others, have noticed that when ever a company starts doing other things besides making money with the best product or service possible; it eventually folds. As some examples,  Kodac and Polariod. I seem to remember that around late 1990s that both started to do all kind of social work or something, and eventually both ended up bust. Kodac went Chap 11 in 2012, Polariod went bankrupt 2001.

1018,CHWY," My opinion - RC needs a ‚Äúburn of the century‚Äù type roadmap to get this moving above $2-300

If you want to dream, take $5B in e comm sales and put 4x CHWY multiple / 75mm shares = $267 GME. This is my base case upside. 

As Mr. Amazon has covered - a burn is not the same as a squeeze. Squeeze is a technical event caused buy a shortage in available shares. A burn - like Tesla - happens as shorts cover, or switch to long, because a new thesis emerges which is so contradictory to their previous beliefs - that it causes a sustained, multi month or year capitulation

2: store rationalization plan

As Mr. Amazon has covered - a burn is not the same as a squeeze. Squeeze is a technical event caused buy a shortage in available shares. A burn - like Tesla - happens as shorts cover, or switch to long, because a new thesis emerges which is so contradictory to their previous beliefs - that it causes a sustained, multi month or year capitulation

A max short burn would, in my opinion, include:

1. Participation from special advisors / potentially new shareholders or strategic partners: Elon, Chamath, Cuban and/or Microsoft, Sony, Nintendo

2: store rationalization plan

3: concrete E comm roadmap to $10-$20b in E comm sales over next 5-10 years 

4. Fan or PowerUp member engagement and monetization (sponsorships, e sports teams, celebrity deals etc)

5. Other?

I believe in RC. But caution to the dreamers - look at what happened to Eddie Lampert and K-Mart / Sears. This is damned hard work.

There's also zero evidence of any naked short selling.  FTDs are not evidence of naked shorting.

Stories about GME's impending doom were caused by the fact that they were losing tons of money and closing stores all over the place.   That has absolutely nothing to do with short selling or hedge funds.

I'll say it again -- never has the act of selling short (naked or otherwise) bankrupted a company.  There have been cases where short sellers attempt to profit by lying about a company -- that didn't happen here.  GameStop really was bleeding money and closing a lot of stores.   These stories were not fake news.

Board members actually left the board over his crazy short selling conspiracy theories because they didn't want to be associated with him.

1245,IBKR," I am also a europoor and revolut is okay if you just want to buy and sell stonks. Keep in mind they dont have all the stonks, mostly popular and established ones.
I am currently in the process of opening an IBKR account because they offer you way more options to lose money with.
If you want a real brokerage - best option for EU (I believe) is ibkr. They have some commissions and fees, but you can do almost anything and they have been in the market for a second. 
If you only want to buy couple of stonks and hold for a while - then you are good with revolut.

I mean I'm not saying that it wasn't a dick move, and it definitely goes against the interest of the investors using the platform. But the claim that they did it at the behest of Citadel is speculation without investigation.

In fact, I'd argue it's likely they didn't do it at Citadel's order because during the hearing and the days after, they made it clear they had a liquidity issue, even though they claim they didn't have a liquidity issue (on the technicality that their solution was to stop trading in the hours before RH would no longer be liquid), and the onlt reason is they refused to liquidate equity in order to raise capital.

This is a much bigger deal for them business wise. Doing something at Citadel's behest is at worst manipulation, which at worst comes with a slap on the wrist fine. Doing what they claim they did spits in the face of every single one of their users. They admitted to spitting in my face.

I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs reasonable to expect every broker to go under, because they‚Äôre on the hook for HF activity that they can‚Äôt control. They shouldn‚Äôt have halted buying and quite frankly the SEC/NYSE should‚Äôve stepped in rather than brokers to fully halt the stock if they thought it would truly collapse them and the market as a whole.

Improvements to the system can and should be made to prevent this from happening (I.e. transparency around shorting, real-time settlement, legitimate fines and jail time for illegal behaviour, etc...).

to pair with it a good short term sell point, which is usually resistance if it's scalping, is the .618 level @ 35.73. This also happens to be the point with a ton of ranging between highs.

1463,GME," Let me be more clear, DFV could have taken off more money on table than he did have now, its generational FU money. He did sold some to cover his investment and more so that‚Äôs rational.

Also he told Congress that he would buy at current prices and he did - $2mil worth, thats not a token $10k, $50k or $100k.

To do so im sure he believes in his fundamental reasons and really likes the stocks.

Now for normies like me who dont have 1 or 2 v large to play with, yes most of us got in at a high price likely between $80 to 300++ during last week of Jan. And those who are still holding are in 3 categories:
a. Full cash position no margin- cos brokers suddenly implemented 100% cash to cause margin closeouts

b. If we sell now we have to eat 90 - 50% losses, no one will do that.

c. GME is now a global movement and üåé citizens are buying or have bought in.

[https://www.thomasnet.com/articles/top-suppliers/aircraft-engine-manufacturers-suppliers/](https://www.thomasnet.com/articles/top-suppliers/aircraft-engine-manufacturers-suppliers/)

Rolls Royce has history.  It's a UK legacy company.  And it's only studying the idea of nuclear powered space flight.  Nuclear powered flight has been kicked around since the 70s.  Quick Googling reveals:

 

>Why don't we use nuclear power for space?  
>  
>One big issue with **nuclear power** in **space** is that you need to discard the heat somehow, which for RTGs you can only do by radiating the heat. You end up having heat-radiating panels in place of solar panels, with substantially lower **energy** output per kilogram than solar panels, unless you are very far from Sun.

That's a huge engineering problem to hurdle.  US isn't launching it's own vehicles into space, UK isn't, Canada isn't.  It's all being launched by Russia and the vehicles have gone from the shuttles back to the capsules.  So that means going from capsules to something much bigger.  It also means that kind of long distance space travel means greater danger, and a lot of programs would be nervous of what that kind of failure would do to public support.

1622,UK," >Jet engines

Why should a single event like an engine blow up, trigger a grounding. Sometimes you have defects in your blades and one of them will break and destroy the engine. All I saw there was a working fire protection preventing the fire to move to the wing which would have been critical. So basically the engine worked like it was supposed to do even when failing.

Manufactures don't pick the engine. The airlines picks the engine. Based on range, fuel consumption and fleet composition. You will find many plane types flying different engines.

Why would you believe in an increased demand for jet engines? In this business you make the main money by selling spare parts not the engines themselves. Due to the pandemic large fleets have been grounded and will fly for longer times now. At the same time it's likely that the number of flights will need some time to recover to pre-covid numbers. Meaning, you will have more grounded planes to take spare parts from. So where is the demand coming from? Just this single engine failure?

&#x200B;

>Ship engines

&#x200B;

That's definitely not the core business here. Why would you expect any country trying to recover from covid related financial damages to increase their military spending? Isn't it more likely that many countries decide to postpone some military acquisitions.  All the listed defense contracts look more like this is the way of the UK government to keep the company running somehow. Building some 20 engines will not safe the company...

&#x200B;

>Spacecrafts

&#x200B;

For such a big company anything space related is mostly for prestige. There are huge material requirements in space flight. This is usually eating up all your revenues. But you can maybe adapt some of your space developments later for your other business branches.

Also, double counting is a known issue for reporting Institutional ownership, as mutual funds report twice when any number of sub-managers report. The optional reporting of open options contracts can further muddy the waters here as well.

Fund ownership % is *likely* already reported in Institutional ownership (105% Institutional ownership, of which x% is from funds).

There's a similar post that he took some of his estimations from - specifically the retail shares numbers. I think that is the hardest number to estimate, and the one the prev. OP used is just a shot in the dark.

I hadn't seen CNN, but I did see a Yahoo Finance poll of meme stock ownership in the U.S which if extrapolated out produces a *much* higher number. For example, if the thousand people they polled (really small sample so this is a wild estimate) happened to own twice as much as the average then retail would still own about 41 M, which is an absurd number.

To me that begs the question, did they really just ""happen"" to poll people who bought a lot of GME? It's a small sample size but still, the average meme stock investment was around $8K, with a median of $250, and 9% of them bought at least one share of GME. Even if they all bought at $300 that is still a median of close to one share and an average of 26. 

The CNN numbers suggest that Yahoo is off by a factor of 5, or 10 considering that many bought below $300. 

I don't think it is ""10% of all retail with an average of 3"", I think it is more like ""2% of retail with an average of 10"" (that would be 1/4 as many retail traders buying GME and less than half as many average shares than the Yahoo poll suggests).

While it is silly to assume that all or even half the accounts subscribed to WSB bought GME (as some estimates have asserted), I do believe that all the loss porn seems to suggest the average number of shares bought is higher than expected. 40K loss porn is a lot of shares. 

What has got me obsessed over these numbers is that even a conservative guesstimate of retail ownership is over 100% of the float. Either a lot of people are lying on the internet (who would do that?) or we collectively already own waaaay more GME shares than we should. If more people start buying again this just gets crazier.

Where do you think the numbers might be off? It's all estimates on estimates...",godofcatsandgoodfood,7,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/loipt0/critique_of_why_gamestop_was_going_to_cause_a/go7d918/,0.038,0.878,0.083,0.9277

1732,GME," I would imagine we see GME trading stop way before that.

1733,GME," I think those might be right in the number of accounts that purchased GME at any point during the GME mania, but I would say the number that currently have GME in their account is likely closer to the CNN business number. There was a huge volume of GME traded every day so any poll responses likely spans multiple times the float being traded.

There was another comment that said: ""Also, double counting is a known issue for reporting Institutional ownership, as mutual funds report twice when any number of sub-managers report. The optional reporting of open options contracts can further muddy the waters here as well.

Fund ownership % is likely already reported in Institutional ownership (105% Institutional ownership, of which x% is from funds).

The known numbers are off and the assumptions aren't based on any due diligence or reliable research. They're just guesses.""

I think the fund ownership section is likely also off and the idea that since the total number of outstanding shares is more than the float does not necessarily mean there are synthetic shorts.",SolveThisProblem,0,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/loipt0/critique_of_why_gamestop_was_going_to_cause_a/go7hhok/,0.0,0.888,0.112,0.9505

1738,GME," Right, but I thought you said the poll was a thousand people. Which means that number could be way off. Retail investors trading daily I would assume are much more likely to respond to Yahoo Finance polls because they are constantly checking their positions and are probably also the type of people who are buying into the GME frenzy. Most account holders who buy and hold long term are probably less likely to respond to or see the poll and are probably less likely to be a part of the frenzy. I don't know where CNN got their percentage, but I would trust it more than the statistical significance of a small sample yahoo finance poll.

If I polled WSB I would get a crazy percentage that had GME in their accounts, but WSB is a small sample and not representative of retail investors. 

Also, I don't think this subreddit has that many shares. The most I've seen anyone holding is DFV at 100k. I would imagine that if it was all added together, WSB owns maybe 1-2 million shares.",SolveThisProblem,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/loipt0/critique_of_why_gamestop_was_going_to_cause_a/go7obx5/,0.049,0.873,0.078,0.631

1740,RH," CNN appears to be the only ones with a number for retail investors. I'm curious as to how they estimate those numbers. They estimated 17% retail ownership on the 26th, 20% in November, and 15% now.

The move from 20% in October to 17% on the 26th has me scratching my head. That would imply a net sell-off among retail, right? When the stock was going viral. So a viral stock run causes a net sell off of 3%? I'm a little skeptical of that.

I can see why it should go down from the 26th to today, but not from October to January. The data implies that every retail trader who bought in the run was matched by a retail trader who sold, and then some more who sold. This is before the RH restrictions too, when everyone and their mother was buying shares. And then the net sell-off post restrictions was only 2%? 

Institutional ownership lost 12% in that time. 

Maybe I'm missing something about the mechanics of short-selling, so correct me if I'm wrong, but wouldn't a SI% change from 140% to 78% require buying a large number of shares from institutions or retail investors in order to return shares borrowed from other institutions?

So HF A borrows stock from Institution B, then to cover they need to buy from Seller C and return it to Institution B. During this time Institution B is shown as being a holder of the share, right? But Seller C is no longer a holder and they could have been either institutional or retail. 

In the context of their previous data the CNN % ownership seems too high. Either the shorts did not cover, or their numbers are wrong.",godofcatsandgoodfood,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/loipt0/critique_of_why_gamestop_was_going_to_cause_a/go8y6g1/,0.066,0.882,0.053,-0.7823
