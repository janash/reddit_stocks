Umm that's not true at all but if it were then that will be reflected in their wage rate because of market demand. Demand ‚¨ÜÔ∏è wages‚¨ÜÔ∏è. I used emojis to make it simple for you 

>You are probably the same kind of person who is now surprised that people are leaving food service jobs and not returning for minimum wage which after inflation is even less than they were making in 2019.

Don't try to get personal with me. And again that's not true, inflation is way way up and depending on the metric could be up 13% to 15%. CPI alone is up 5% YoY and that excludes a lot of factors bc economists deemed it ToO CoMpLiCaTeD.

And if you're referring to people not returning to work bc UI benefits pay better, well that's true and it's also inorganic wage growth. Full employment can cause rampant inflation and UI is mimicking full employment and competing with market driven efficiencies.

The only people that really lose in this environment is the middle class. The poor don't really benefit bc real wage growth is non existent and the wealthy can simply reallocate.

I included the Low Risk heading in here for a reason. Promoting how healthy this company is and how safe an investment it is while simultaneously promoting options is ludicrous. I know this is WSB, I know. However, options are ***not*** a safe investment. They're inherently risky and thus come with greater rewards. Deep ITM calls are much more safe, as long as you're exercising, but let's be real, WSB thrives on those cheap FDs. If we look at CRSRs activity over the past several months (excluding today. I know it's up a lot) it's just been sideways trading. Which is to be expected, because of it's low IV!  If you buy some slightly OTM calls and hold them until expiry, your investment goes to zero if the stock hardly moves. Even if it moves slightly higher, these will be crushed by Theta decay. Poof! Whereas if you would have put the same amount into stocks, you'd still be holding the equity and might even be in the green!

233,USB," If you are an enthusiast or just really serious about value/performance, you'll know that corsair is not the best brand. Imo they've done a better job than their competitors marketing themselves to their target audience, and that is why they'll remain ahead of their competition. If you can find a good sale on any of their products, you'll still be very happy. 

If you like rgb corsair has the nicest looking rgb hands down and their software is easy to use and customize.  Their customer service is also pretty good. I had to have the front USB panel of my case replaced and all my emails were replied to within 24-36 hours and I was able to get the new part shipped out to me with tracking in 3-4 days.

If you want to get the best value or best performance, there are other brands that are better depending on what you are looking for (fans, ram, power supply, keyboards, mice, etc.). They're not the best in anything but they're decent all around. 

Someone else mentioned El Gato, which they own, and there are much cheaper alternatives to all their products as well (stream deck, capture card) but for the same reasons, I mentioned above, a lot of people will still purchase El Gato products. 

People that have done their research or are really into pc parts know that corsair isn't the best but they have to at least recognize they're still killing it with their intended customer base.",Animalbus,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nzlwcy/crsr_dd_part_2_or_why_corsair_will_swallow_the/h1rbxm5/,0.077,0.829,0.095,-0.3045

268,RH," EDIT: read the reply to mine as well, as there is incorrect information in my post.

That money is what the OP already spent for the right to make a purchase of 100 shares should he or she choose to do so. That money is already gone and spent. However, the higher the price goes, the more money he will make up in return. 

For example, if the price stays above $40 but nothing else, he'll get what he spent on the $40 call plus whatever either RH chose to sell out the options for (I did a $42 option and I ended up with $50 return, so I earned $8 in total) or were this elsewhere he could truly hold the option for those sales until it reached higher.

Underneath the $40 it says 25 buys, so he bought the option to buy 100 shares 25 times.

If the price dips below $40 then all that money is gone.

Now, if the price goes to $50 then he can sell 100 shares (25 times) at $50 each. In his own reply he said he spend $11.65 per share, so imagine buying 100 shares at $11.65 each and selling them for $50.  Now multiply that by 25 (the number of contracts of 100 shares he purchased).",koreawut,4,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nzag7k/amc_to_the_moon/h1p4mdc/,0.0,0.894,0.106,0.964

494,WISH," I'm not smart enough to give you advice in regards to options, unfortunately, but I'm sure some people are.

Right now, you've sold 5 calls with a strike of 12.5. Which means if they get exercised you have to sell the holder 100 shares per contract for 12.5 each.

So at a cost basis of 10.2 that means you will make 1.150 if you get exercised (and you obviously got some premium for selling the calls).

Whether to buy back or not probably depends on how much it would cost you and how confident you are on the price of WISH rising much higher than 12.5.

If you expect the price to rise to - say - 20 fast, buying them back is probably gonna be a good idea since you'd make 4.900 as opposed 1.150 if you were able to sell the shares at 20.

However, if you expect the price to just barely scrape/surpass 12.50, it might not be worth buying back.",DRMRCX,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nzmpxn/wish_coming_true/h1qz6jp/,0.04,0.839,0.121,0.9536

I have two profitable WISH spreads

7/16 10c buy to open and 20c sell to open

And 10/15 12.5c buy to open and 17.5c sell to open

This greatly mitigates risk but of course caps your potential profit if it exceeds the higher target. 

But I'd rather guarantee consistent profits.

926,DCF," This is not a DCF, this is pricing. Terminal value is a huge input for a growth story, and you've turned it away from an intrinsic valuation into pricing using the multiple at the end.

But to stay with your assumptions, am I reading this correctly that you're assuming a Sales / Capital ratio (measure of reinvestment, meaning Change in Revenue / Reinvestment) of almost 4 in the beginning year, and effectively a Sales / Capital ratio of more than 13 in year 5? How is all this revenue growth achieved with no additional reinvestment? Are they progressively getting ridiculously efficient in reinvesting? The Natural Gas Distribution Sector has a Sales to Capital ratio of 0.54 for reference, and even granting unusually high efficiency it strikes me as too much.

I know jack shit about the company, but the insane reinvestment efficiency is fishy to me - and it frankly seems like you forgot to have the company reinvest more in line with its revenue growth.

958,CLNE," Amazon receives warrants for 53.14 million shares of CLNE common stock at an exercise price of $13.49/share. Those warrants become available to Amazon at set intervals as Amazon moves towards its commitment in the agreement to purchase $500M in fuel from CLNE.  Also, Jeff Bezos had to agree to be locked in a giant, sealed hamster ball with 3 cows that have each been fed a #4 from Taco Bell and a 6 pack of Milwaukee's Best.  This will be shown via pay-per-view- please contact your local cable provider.

13.28 million of the warrant shares are immediately available to Amazon.  Amazon will have incentive to exercise these warrants the higher the share price rises over $13.49.

These warrants will essentially act as a dilution when exercised by Amazon.  However, CLNE stands to gain the $500M in revenue plus $716.86M from the warrant shares over the life of this agreement.  Amazon has until 04/16/31 to exercise the warrants.  Once/if fully executed, Amazon would own 19.99% of CLNE common shares.",Bilbo-Baggins77,20,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nz6yy3/my_clne_valuation_model_29_price_target/h1odltv/,0.0,0.744,0.256,0.9902

A great summary. 

It's very hard to grasp just how sticky infrastructure and systems could be, and CLNE is the easy way out. 

An easy way to think about it is how Microsoft OS has managed to stick around for so long.

So the argument which is that Wish sells cheap shit is flawed and incorrect unless you also say the same about Shopify, Amazon, Aliexpress, etc...",IcyTitle1,-2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nznldk/you_wish_for_a_10x_bagger_but_fail_to_realize_its/h1qe2pf/,0.108,0.723,0.17,0.7739

No refunds! On either.

I did some gumshoe dd last week and can confirm that the PetCo near me is undergoing a renovation FWIW. About 1/3 of the store footprint is walled off for the reno. Thought I'd buy some cat food while there and the three person line was not moving because the cashier was taking her sweet ass time collecting phone number info from a slow ass customer (is this 2017?). I ended up ditching my shit because I'm impatient as fuck and instead opting to feed my cat the kids beta fish that night. They do need to work on their customer service as you said. News of self-checkout terminals would be a bullish sign that they actually give a fuck about their customers.

Linkedin shows about 8,500 job openings in the US indicating that they are working on customer service and/or are growing. I have no reference value for that number so take it with a lick of salt.

1593,WKHS," Some modifications...

Point 3 - It is hard to assume that legacy companies can or cannot catch up, when WKHS has yet to produce much or demonstrate an ability to achieve profitable mass production.

Point 5 - Cathie Woods sold all her WKHS shares.

Point 6 - WKHS said it produced 38 C-Series vehicles this year (through March), which is more than double the combined prior three quarters. So they are at roughly 13 trucks per month. At that rate it will take them 50 years to fulfill the Pride Group order. The issue is can WKHS get to profitable mass production of these. That is a massive challenge. Losing money every quarter on low volume production, is not a viable business plan.

Point 8 - For Q1, they had expenses of about 17M versus 500K in revenue. 6M of those expenses where Cost of Goods. It would seem reasonable that as they increase production their costs will rise significantly. Perhaps revenues are rising at a faster rate, but as that loss from operations continues to increase in the coming quarters you will find the cash burn rate increasing. Basically unless they can keep costs flat between now and high volume production (not going to happen) they will be desperate for additional funds soon. Seriously, look at Revenues and operating costs and pray come up with a model that shows how they get from here to operating profit (or positive cash-flow) without needing additional funds. It is a near-impossibility I think.

The other points can be debated as to their merit or relevance, but just focusing on these few points that I believe are factually incorrect or lacking in significant ways.",aka0007,9,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nzhzy0/wkhs_why_you_shouldnt_be_short_no_financial_advice/h1px4cw/,0.043,0.841,0.117,0.962
1594,WKHS," Not saying WKHS will or will not fly in the short-term, but people need to be careful about electric vehicle companies. They are literally the dotcom hype.

There is a ton of hype around these companies but it is important people realize electrical vehicles will remain a complete niche market that is hardcapped by physics (electricity production, transport, rare earth materials for batteries and storage) that are not looking to be solved in the near future at all.

Within 5 to 10 years most major oil producing companies will have switched over to the production of emission free synthetic and bio fuels. All facilities and logistics that are currently involved in the production and distribution of fossil fuels can with relatively minor costs be refitted for the production and distribution of synthetic and bio fuels. The same goes for most modern combustion engines which can quite easily be refitted for the use of synthetic and bio fuels, or are already capable of doing so.

Make all the money you want in the shortterm on EV's but please be aware once the first big announcement on synthetic fuels comes in the electric vehicle industry will plummet and never recover.",eoekas,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nzhzy0/wkhs_why_you_shouldnt_be_short_no_financial_advice/h1qdysh/,0.0,0.892,0.108,0.9663

1644,GO," In times of inflation, debt is your friend. Let other peoples money loose value while you hold a real asset, like gold or real estate.

In times of a deflationary crash with high unemployment, debt is your biggest enemy. Your mortgaged home will be foreclosed and sold for a shit price in a flooded market because everybody else is also bankrupt.

&#x200B;

Right now, both are plausible. The virus haltet trade and made the economy decline. The US and EU are trying to overplay the unemployment with benefits for those people and no mortgage foreclosures. So we could either see a 1923 Germany scenario, with high unemployment followed by hyper inflation because we were ""saved"" from unemployment with printed money, or we get inflation directly, without even seeing the deflationary shock the central banks and governments try to prevent before it even happens.

But in the bigger picture, any look at the M3 money supply in the US (Source: St Louis FRED) as well as the Gold price at $1900 instead of the fixed $35 in 1970 will tell you one thing: MONEY PRINTER GO BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR.

It should be actually a good thing to have debts in case of inflation. Inflation also tends to make the price of houses increase. So I'd say it's a good time to get a loan to buy a house. Inflation will increase the value of your house and decrease the value of your debt at the same time. I'm not sure it works in the US house market (I don't know this market), but in France I'm quite sure it will work.

In any case, GREAT NEWS, for those invested in RIDE. Steve Burns is making a new EV company that will make a Pickup truck with in-wheel motors and batteries (so no need for wires!) and is getting that ATVM loan any day. Lol...

1960,AI," Huge potential for 
- big energy storage (think for countries)
- home energy storage / solar
- AI: autobidder software, fsd, renting out dojo
- If someone will realize a global autonomous taxi fleet in the next 10 years, I‚Äôm putting 90% chance on it being Tesla, and they actually also produce the cars
- Tesla semi, roadster and cybertruck coming
- car software (think apps, fsd, netflix, the spaceX internet, etc). 
- batteries and drive chain technology 
- The cross-selling of it all. Someone who buys a Tesla will help improve AI, will more likely buy Tesla solar, maybe slap some starlink on it, etc
- On this point, tesla insurance. All teslas are equiped with cameras, vehicle tracking and theres plenty of statistics that Teslas are by far both the safest vehicles as well as the vehicles with the least accidents per mile driven (excluding non-daily drivers)
- A monopoly at talent who are willing to work hard for little pay. Best fad AI expert? Working at tesla. Best rocket engineers? Working at spaceX. Best battery people? Tesla.
- just plain manufacturing. Not building some hundred thousand cars, but manufacturing millions on a gigantic Factario scale combined with access to literal rocket engineers who will design new materials and production techniques for you. This combined with inhouse manufacturing and limited varieties (meaning you can build a very optimized car in gigantic quantities) means way better profit margins (20-25% margin now, aiming for 40%) than any competitor. Tesla is internally guiding to grow 50% a year in production, up to 20 million cars a year and actually have the roadmap to back it up

There‚Äôs probably more. This list grows every goddamn year and it all fits together brilliantly. By the time backwards looking analysis people figure it out, they will not inderstand what will happen the year after.

Final note: they are fresh and the only company who can make a profit on EVs. They don‚Äôt have sunk costs on ICE technology. They don‚Äôt need to transition from a dealership model. They don‚Äôt need a cultural transition or get rid of their boomer personnel with decades of experience in  old technology.

- If someone will realize a global autonomous taxi fleet in the next 10 years, I‚Äôm putting 90% chance on it being Tesla, and they actually also produce the cars
- Tesla semi, roadster and cybertruck coming
- car software (think apps, fsd, netflix, the spaceX internet, etc). 
- batteries and drive chain technology 
- The cross-selling of it all. Someone who buys a Tesla will help improve AI, will more likely buy Tesla solar, maybe slap some starlink on it, etc
- On this point, tesla insurance. All teslas are equiped with cameras, vehicle tracking and theres plenty of statistics that Teslas are by far both the safest vehicles as well as the vehicles with the least accidents per mile driven (excluding non-daily drivers)
- A monopoly at talent who are willing to work hard for little pay. Best fad AI expert? Working at tesla. Best rocket engineers? Working at spaceX. Best battery people? Tesla.
- just plain manufacturing. Not building some hundred thousand cars, but manufacturing millions on a gigantic Factario scale combined with access to literal rocket engineers who will design new materials and production techniques for you. This combined with inhouse manufacturing and limited varieties (meaning you can build a very optimized car in gigantic quantities) means way better profit margins (20-25% margin now, aiming for 40%) than any competitor. Tesla is internally guiding to grow 50% a year in production, up to 20 million cars a year and actually have the roadmap to back it up

There‚Äôs probably more. This list grows every goddamn year and it all fits together brilliantly. By the time backwards looking analysis people figure it out, they will not inderstand what will happen the year after.

Final note: they are fresh and the only company who can make a profit on EVs. They don‚Äôt have sunk costs on ICE technology. They don‚Äôt need to transition from a dealership model. They don‚Äôt need a cultural transition or get rid of their boomer personnel with decades of experience in  old technology.

The no squeeze is because short % is unclear with the split market. I only have vague news reports from europe about how heavily it's shorted there. Retail doesn't have easy access from us/canada where the disposable cash is. Even if people are interested you can't do those juicy options. 

As you can see from this thread people are still angry with the company right now which is ironic since people pilled in on GME and GME's entire business model was scam gamers. This is literally the exact opposite scenario where a long trusted company made bad marketing moves. They literally gave refunds to players who had disappointing experiences which is why the stock is plummeting further.

2074,NYC," I just listened in on the annual stockholder's meeting, which just now concluded. The company is poised to make great gains and expand at a pretty rapid pace, especially with the Amazon partnership happening later this year. Amazon will own a 20% stock in the company, but only as they buy more fuel. Currently, they're servicing LA transit, NYC transit, Waste Management, and Republic (waste company). Their numbers look solid and once airports open up, their gallons sold per year will double.

I'll also note that the strike price for Amazon is over $13.

Amazon receives warrants for 53.14 million shares of CLNE common stock at an exercise price of $13.49/share. Those warrants become available to Amazon at set intervals as Amazon moves towards its commitment in the agreement to purchase $500M in fuel from CLNE.

13.28 million of the warrant shares are immediately available to Amazon.  Amazon will have incentive to exercise these warrants the higher the share price rises over $13.49.

These warrants will essentially act as a dilution when exercised by Amazon.  However, CLNE stands to gain the $500M in revenue plus $716.86M from the warrant shares over the life of this agreement.  Amazon has until 04/16/31 to exercise the warrants.  Once/if fully executed, Amazon would own 19.99% of CLNE common shares.",Bilbo-Baggins77,16,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nzqice/clne_cornering_the_market/h1qw8to/,0.03,0.671,0.299,0.9878

2855,ASO," Corsair may go up long long term, I would only consider getting LEAPS though. Short term the premiums on the calls aren't worth the risk imo, and mid term it has a lot of resistance to overcome.

2859,CRSR," Seconded, i remember watching clov do basically this, a small runup, media coverage, then explosion.
