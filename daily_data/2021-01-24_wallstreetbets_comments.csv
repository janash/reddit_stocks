15,GME,"You can only ""short"" a stock when its going up. You can't short a stock on red candles. Shorts arent only betting against the company stock price to fall, they are effectively putting pressure on the stock downward by short selling. In retard terms, they borrow stock from their broker for a daily borrowing rate, to temporarily sell the shares and tank a stock price. Then when it tanks because everyone else sells, they buy those shares back, and keep the profit in between.


Short squeezes happen when a short seller(or multiple) shorts a stock and the stock price rises. If it rises enough, the short sellers must buy the shares back, or their broker will for them due to margin, to cover their short position which ends up putting upward pressure on a stock causing a massive inflow of upward pressure due to a ""short squeeze"".

24,OVID,Yes OP did make a mistake. Closing out a loan account usually knocks your score down a few points if it’s an old loan because the average age of your credit accounts goes down.

You could defer mortgage payments here in Canada, which sounded great, but the details revealed they just tacked the deferred payments to the end of the loan, which will just end up costing you more in the long run, lol.

Maybe in the future we all get take out from the Game Stop restaurant. We buy all our clothes from Game Stop. The Game Stop Mall is a one stop shop for all the Game Stop purchases your family needs. Cars and Jewelry are only of good quality if they came from Game Stop.

Don't believe me? Look at the man's comment history. There are rarely any long comments. Sounds like someone trying not to fuck around with the time continuum, and keep the future on course. About a week ago he was asked if he would use his 1.2M$ in cash for GME shares, and he simply replied,

Maybe I will.

Over a year ago a guy pointed out that he was losing money on GME, and pointed out several reasons for it's poor performance. He simply replied,

January 2021.

This is the reply of a man who knows the future. He doesn't understand that there are other bets to make because this Game Stop meme stock will literally let them overtake every single market they enter starting from Jan 2021. And that appears to be the only important date he knows.

So as a future man he began to YOLO everything into GME before 2021 turned the corner. He didn't care about the spread sheets and cost analysis reports. He was just an autist retard from the future that knew Game Stop would one day own the world, and that it all began in Jan of 2021.

He's turned 10's of thousands of dollars into over 10 million dollars, and he still isn't pulling out. This man knows something, and we need to YOLO into GME now if we want to be millionairs after a year too.",0.124,0.807,0.069,-0.9573

Second of all, one of the major fears is that a GME stock offering will tank the market price, but I am anticipating them to do so at prices upwards of $300-- this is theoretically infinite, after all, and our hands are made of diamond.

based on the 100mil cap, that is at most 300k shares... which is NOTHING compared to short float! 🚀 🚀 🚀 significantly more shorts left on friday already (I think? so fucking hard to find info on that)

BUT 100mil is only 1/5 of their debt... I guess they fucked up with this planned offering and didnt expect such astronomical heights, heights made possibly by our sexy diamond hands. 🚀 🚀 🚀

Someone explain to me why im wrong and shouldnt be even more bullish than ever.

142,FIVE,"Copying from u/NrdRage 

So one of the interesting things that happened yesterday with that Gamma squeeze is that it revealed....the sellers had largely given up (this is important, I promise)


Yesterday morning, there was a large sell wall at 49.50 that I did NOT think $GME was going to be able break through.  So much so that I actually opened a short position at 49.27 in anticipation of bouncing off of it and falling to 45.


That sell wall wasn't defeated, but the entity that put it in place removed it, which is why the stock blew right through and didn't slow down again until about 52.  The important thing, though, was that the next sell wall?  Wasn't until EIGHTY FIVE.  I've never closed a short position so quickly in my life.  The moment I saw it at 50.58 I knew there was no resistance at all and I took my loss immediately.


The removal of that wall was a total capitulation by sellers, who waved the white flag.  Had it not been for the circuit breakers, $GME would have ABSOLUTELY gotten over 100 yesterday.  The only reason it closed as low as it did yesterday was because retail investors aren't used to seeing circuit breakers.  They don't understand them or why they're in place.  So it scared them.  Because why wouldn't it be scary when a stock stops trading?  That gave people who weren't even really looking at GME a few minutes to prepare to open large short positions, which is why you saw the stock absolutely plummet after the 2nd breaker - so much so that it triggered a downside breaker.    But if you look at the sell-side during that downswing, it was all tiny sell orders.  50 shares here, 100 shares there, some 20's, etc.  It was  🧻🤚 running for the hills because they didn't understand what was happening.  So even after that 2nd breaker, there was no real conviction on the sell side.  Which is why the stock was able to rebound to 65 from 57.


This is all a very long TL:DR of saying everybody keeps saying 420.69 as a joke, but....I wouldn't laugh if I were you, because when these squeezes and margin calls happen, there's absolutely no sell conviction to keep the price from skyrocketing.

Seeing a lot of posts of new members saying if it’s too late to buy GME on Monday. The answer is an absolute NO, it is NOT too late IMO. 

This thing is just starting. There were two circuit breaks on Friday that prevented GME from reaching triple digit figures and that value potential can carry over to Monday. 

Second, the media (CNN, Business Insider, FOX, Etc) are all covering what WSB did on Friday. Meaning the GME word is now out of Reddit and into the mainstream media worldwide, this interest and free publicity is going to push the demand even higher. WSB is also getting a huge jump in membership (2 mill subs) and GME was even a top 10 most googled term yesterday. The word is out 

Just YOLO dropped $15,000 to buy even more GME stocks first thing Monday morning at market open. 

The best is yet to come 🚀🚀🚀🚀 💪🏿

Free float is even lower thanks to us keeping it up over $60 at Friday EOD. Monday is going to be pretty wild if enough people hold. I'm hoping the majority of retail shareholders are still us that have been on WSB for a while since we are the ones more likely to continue holding due to the higher appetite for risk lol. Hopefully not too many of the people that guy in Friday were directed from other media outlets, or if they were then hopefully they are looking for 10-50x gains and they hold on Monday waiting for bigger jumps in the sp.

When a big stockholder sells, the stock price will go up creating even more pressure on those who still bet against GME because it becomes increasingly expensive to do so.

People in WSB have been talking about a short squeeze potential in GME for a while now. Here's a [Aug 2020 video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alntJzg0Um4) from DFV discussing it and I believe I've seen it discussed even earlier. I'm certain the big players were well aware of the potential and have been thinking through how they can profit from it.

At most, retail interest may be accelerating a potential short squeeze through buying activity. And if such a squeeze happens, the real money will be made by the big players. Many of them have already been bleeding the short sellers through interest on borrowed shares and might even prefer to draw out the closing of shorts so they can first capture some more interest payments before squeezing them in short closing.",0.0,0.863,0.137,0.9817

Understand that nobody truly ""knows"". There are educated decisions (proper DD), educated guesses, hunches and feelings as well as opposition yelling as loud as possible which will in turn create doubt. In the end, nobody knows.

That's why it's important to set targets, realistic ones and then play with what you can afford to lose.

Diamond hands for one person means from $8 a share to $100, for someone else it might mean $420.69 and for the next guy it's $1000.

It's important to know what you're able/willing to lose vs. ""can you imagine how high it can go?!?"" - it's good to read cautionary tales and understand d what the implications/risks are.

There are no certainties, and EVERYBODY takes hits and losses on the market. But to learn how to offset those losses and make gains in the long run, now that's the skill you want to develop.

356,GME,"It's everything, not just GME but it especially stands for this current situation.

Understand that nobody truly ""knows"". There are educated decisions (proper DD), educated guesses, hunches and feelings as well as opposition yelling as loud as possible which will in turn create doubt. In the end, nobody knows.

That's why it's important to set targets, realistic ones and then play with what you can afford to lose.

Diamond hands for one person means from $8 a share to $100, for someone else it might mean $420.69 and for the next guy it's $1000.

It's important to know what you're able/willing to lose vs. ""can you imagine how high it can go?!?"" - it's good to read cautionary tales and understand d what the implications/risks are.

There are no certainties, and EVERYBODY takes hits and losses on the market. But to learn how to offset those losses and make gains in the long run, now that's the skill you want to develop.

We can get them here with a couple of brokers (search the UK investing sub for a while to find them), specifically US brokers who operate here.

Right now most people are buying stocks because they help with the short squeeze. The massive gains you see are likely call options though (‘calls’ are bets that the stock will go up, ‘puts’ are bets that they’ll go down).

If you see people talking about GME 1/27 100c, for example, those are calls that GME will hit 100 by 27th of January (stupid America dating system). 

Options are way riskier than stocks as you can lose literally everything when they expire, but much more earning potential. I’ve given you a simplified explanation though, and much more goes into it. YouTube should be of some help!

You can agree with someone to buy 1000 shares of Initech stock for $110 each on friday (Ie, that's an option to buy). They set a price for this option, let's say you pay them $5000.  
If the stock hasnt gone up over $110 on friday your option is now worthless (you dont need to use it, because if you did you'd have to pay more per stock than it's worth).  
But if the stock is worth $125 then you can use the option, buy for $110k and immediately sell for $125k, making a profit of $15k minus the $5k you paid for the option.  
Of course in this scenario you could also just have bought stocks for $100 on monday and sold for $125k on friday.  
But if the price goes down, in the case of the option you're only down the price of the option, but if you bought stocks you can potentially lose any amount, eg if the stock nosedives to $50 before you decide to sell then you  lost a full $50k.

Massive potential in the auto industry, but the trick that interests me the most is their Cyber Suite lineup. The Air Force recently contracted to use their Spark UEM system for securely accessing data and communications from within devices (phones/laptops/etc.) without having to manage the device itself. The big benefits are that users/employees can use personal devices and connect to work related resources through the app. Also adds some cool AI features like ""active authentication"" where the app will learn your moves and tendencies over time to continually verify you're the one using the app. (Basically, if someone finds your phone unlocked and tries to poke around in the app, the app recognizes the movements are inconsistent and locks them out.)

If it goes well with the Air Force, this could be adopted by the rest of the US military since it has already met their security certifications. US Military buy-in = deep pockets and consistent contracts.

Right now, Cyber Suite isn't making up much of the market share in that segment.

I have a degree in Computer Science,  I’ve engineered systems that run on Windows, Unix, Linux, containers using Docker and Kubernetes.  Open source software will always have more known vulnerabilities because the code base is easily viewed.  Many people with diverse engineering backgrounds can view that code.  This leads to more vulnerabilities being found, but also to more of those vulnerabilities being fixed, and fixed faster than closed source operating systems.

There’s a reason why Black Hat hackers love to take advantage of organizations that use windows.  It’s not that Linux is impossible to hack but exploiting windows is easier by an order of magnitude.  Those people that hack for profit usually take the path of least resistance to profit.

As of macOS Catalina Apple removed all old NeXTSTEP(based on BSD Unix 4.4) code and the OS is now entirely based on FreeBSD Unix with some Apple custom written code on top of it.

FreeBSD is an entirely open source operating system.  It has many contributors but not as many as Linux and is not as popular, it is still considered more secure by miles than the windows kernel.

Windows makes some very stupid architectural decisions when it comes to security.  Couple that with the performance of the windows kernel  vs the Linux kernel and you now know why most cloud providers exclusively offer Linux.

Microsoft relies on “capturing” your business and making it difficult to use other technologies as integrating with a Microsoft ecosystem is more opaque than say integrating Linux systems with FreeBSD.  Hell even the majority of Azure Cloud instances are running some kind of linux.

Integration is the name of the game in tech the tech world at the moment.  Any company not moving to the cloud and away from Microsoft is frankly behind the curve.

How does this relate to blackberry?  Blackberry devices use two operating systems Blackberry 10 and Android.  Blackberry 10 Based on QNX shown in this chart had its last release three years ago in April and the company has moved to android as of 2019.  Like Microsoft and their Azure Cloud Platform  Blackberry sees that custom homegrown closed source operating systems are dying.  I have a feeling that before the end of the decade Microsoft Windows will either be defunct or will no longer use the closed source NT kernel and be a distribution of Linux or based on some kind of Unix.

Tech companies are seeing the writing on the wall folks the open source operating system revolution isn’t just a passing fad but a trend that’s been on the rise for years.  Don’t bet on the losers folks, bet on where the tech industry is innovating, open source software and platforms.

You're correct. Unlucky-Prize is a paid shill. Been following him for a while.

I'll just quote my past comment summarizing his behaviour (reply to his post on WSB tribalism):

""Unluck-prize is all like ""People don't pay enough attention to me and I get  downvoted, must be tribalism!"", ""WSB content is shit (shocking!) my  analysis is great, witness me!"".

Questions is why does this guy care so much and why he produces so much content on GME.

One  can come to a logical conclusion he's either an average trader with  superiority complex (which is fine) or a paid shill. His first post are  full of manipulative, fearmongering hyperbolic expressions in every  paragraph. When I called him out he adapted and changed the tone of his  messaging.

In his tribalism post  he's in essence complaining about not having enough influence over WSB  crowd. Really mate? Why would you fucking care? Do you get a bonus for a  number of upvotes or what?

\-> Sherman is great - still bearish

\-> MOASS is impossible - bearish

\-> shorts already covered - bearish

\-> Citron knows shorting and is legit - bearish

If the sell the options, who do you think they're selling the options to?  That's right, the market makers who wrote the options.  Open interest goes down, so now MMs unwind their hedges by selling the stock they bought earlier in the week.  My guess is that all the market makers know this is coming and won't be 100% hedged, because they expect a gamma unwinding to happen almost certainly.  So you might not even see as big a gamma squeeze as you would normally expect.

Now, the interim hypothetical mid week squeeze *might* be enough to get some smaller hedge funds margin called on their shorts.  But, the big guys are going to ride it out.

927,GME,"I posted this an another thread, but if you are going to risk it all you should at least know the bear case:

It's possible that the majority of people who wanted in on GME are already maxed out. If thats the case - it could trade sideways or even down early next week.

Image if it trades slightly down for 1 or 2 days and the promised short squeeze doesn't happen. Then all the shares from this weeks ITM call options are delivered on Tuesday and those people take profits, pushing the stock slightly down. Then some bulls who put all their net worth into GME lose interest and start taking just a little bit of cash off the table.

By this point you've had many days of sideways or downwards action AND the available float for shorting is increasing. Eventually things snap and those who joined the meme train make a run for the exits, crashing the stock down to the prices where either shorts have to take profit or value investors step in.

This is just one scenario, however unlikely, that I think is possible. I'm happy to hear feedback on points I may have off.",0.029,0.84,0.131,0.9721

If it takes you over 140K you would be disqualified from making any contribution.

So when you reap in those tasty tendies and later realize that you made too much taxable income,  you will have to pull the excess contribution out ALONG with the gains, get taxed on that income and incur an additional tax penalty for being a tard.

I had a similar situation and was able to catch it quick.  I contributed 3k in early 2020.  I usually only do half in the beginning of the year in case I make too much.  Earlier this month I made a 3k 2021 contribution.  I have GME in taxable accounts and my ROTH.  My gains in the taxable accounts already disqualify me from a ROTH contribution.  Fortunately I was able to have my broker switch the 2021 contribution to a 2020 contribution bringing me to the 6000 max.

There is not a single fraud rule that applies to what is currently happening on WSB - there is no fraudulent information deliberately being dispersed, insider trading, NO part within the whole gamut of fraud. OTOH, the SEC frequently issues advisories that could create new precedent that would apply to social media and the things we see on WSB. Seems like a stretch to me though.

But yeah, always selling to zero shares seems a bit odd as a CFO no? But since he always does this it's probably not a bad sign at all. Maybe he just doesn't like to hold shares as the financial officer, but is this a common occurrence? Just wondering why head finance honcho don't want any.

Typically they will give them options where they can buy the company stock at a reduced price once certain goals are met (at least at a well run company). However this system is also abused, since the board can set the option price. But in theory it's suppose to get the C-suite to align their goals with investor goals and drive the stock price up.

I think Tesla will keep their own platform exclusive. QNX is not new, it's linux-based and has been developed and improved for many years. It will likely be much easier to implement for car companies than software specifically made for Tesla.

Also Blackberry already has deals with Sony I believe but there are lots of electric cars coming from all sorts of brands.

The media is framing this whole thing as though it's happening solely because of WSB, when in reality GameStop/GME is being discussed in literally every trading community in the country. It's literally everywhere. All facebook groups, all discords, all over twitter, probably in every office, over the the phone..... But the media is pushing the narrative that this is all WSB, which is basically fucking impossible.... It's not WSB that has zeroed in on this stock and believe in it, it's the entire country.

And even if it was WSB, WSB is just an internet forum where individuals discuss stocks and share memes. There's no organization. There's no leadership. WSB is just ""investors."" So not only is the media misrepresenting who's buying this stock, but they're also misrepresenting what WSB actually is to make it sound like a nefarious organization, which is obviously ridiculous.",0.053,0.907,0.041,-0.2372

There’s no current legal basis to regulate us in such a way, but I just hope there’s no political pressure to move in such a direction (see, eg, the recent Larry Summers interview on Boomerberg). 

Just speaking frankly, since Establishment Dems now control the political branches in DC, if they choose to regulate in the direction Summers strongly implied in his interview, most established media outlets will go all-in on pushing and selling that course of action to the public at large.

The 1/22 22C means that he had am option position (a call) that he purchased a while ago where on 1/22 he bet that GME would exceed 22$ a share. As we can see, it very much. So for every contract he had, you multiply that by the total dollar difference of current price over the $22 strike price. So if GME ended at $65 a share he would have made $43 (65-22). I dont have the specifics obviously on what exactly amount was made, but just know that contracts consist of 100 shares. So if he bought 5 contracts at 22C, he would be able to buy the shares at 22$ (500 shares) and sell them for 65$ a share. so $43 x 500 = 21.5k in profit alone.

1) Don't put your entire portfolio into options. Try around 20-30% and rest buy shares

2) Set an expiration date that's at least 2mon out. The further the date the more time you have to exit your position with minimal loss. Also means less gains but better safe than sorry

3) Don't look at other peoples gain porn too much. It'll make you think you can have the same success but you most likely wont

So lets say for example you like a stock like BB and have $10k, put $7k into shares, $2k into $15/16C expiring in March/April, $1k into $14/15C expiring in end of Feb/early March

I'm not sure about the ""line of succession"" for inheritance in that case, but if enough people renounce the inheritance then everything goes to the state. Lawmakers being lawmakers the state will get all assets but not pay any of the debt.

My uncle died with large amounts of debt to his landlord. Nobody inherited that. Are you saying if I lived in the USA and it'd been his student debt (as if that drunkard ever would go to college) I'd have no way to renounce the inheritance?",0.152,0.822,0.026,-0.9671

But it was a decision so autistic you’ve breached the savant category and have treaded into u/DeepFuckingValue waters.

**Here’s a list of what to do now if you don’t know already or if you don’t already have a plan:**

1. Pay off debt.

2. Stash as much in retirement accounts as you can. Max 2 Roth IRAs for 2021, 2022, and 2023 if possible. Max your 401k at $19,000 for 2022, and do it again in 2023.

3. Invest the rest in index funds in a taxable brokerage account.

4. Use part of it as down payment on property.

5. Put some in savings for the possible education expenses.

6. Follow the steps and the flow chart in the wiki on the sidebar: “PRIME DIRECTIVE: How to handle $”.

7. Optional: Donate some to me. A stranger. 
Someone who you have never met, just out of the good in your heart, if there is any. ( 🤷‍♂️ Worth a try)

Try this on for size:

We believe in the battle hard-won.

The good fight.

The toughness of mind, quickness of wit, and clarity of heart that can only be earned.

Earned through taking a hit, going down, getting back up, feet planted, fists raised, ready for another furious round.

We are BlackBerry.

After three decades, we are more than still standing, we are standing up for something better.

We are the world’s leading provider of secure and trusted end-to-end mobility solutions.

Because when it comes to your safety, you need to be shoulder-to-shoulder with someone tested, trusted, and forged by experience.",0.105,0.76,0.135,0.6989

2279,PLTR,"**History Refresher:**
Today, WSB falls under its greatest scrutiny, most of which can be attributed to the chagrin of a few large institutional opponents. So, let’s pause for a moment and reflect upon a time not too long ago when another online safe-house slid into similar cross-hairs.  

Let’s start with PLTR. Many of you homophobic retards are too young to remember, but wayyy back in 2016 PLTR’s cofounder *Peter Thiel* quietly bankrolled litigation against an online news forum called Gawker. These law suits tackled [sex tapes, Hulk Hogan, and other random salacious shit](https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattdrange/2016/06/21/peter-thiels-war-on-gawker-a-timeline/), but nothing related to the PLTR cofounder himself?  *So, why did Thiel finance the legal attack against Gawker?* To find the answer, we must go back a decade earlier when Gawker ran a story under the headline “Peter Thiel is totally gay, people.” Gawker outted Thiel. Thiel exacted his petty revenge, as all feisty gays will do.

As history would have it, those lawsuits ultimately shut Gawker down. And today, a half decade later, Gawker has not reassembled in any similar fashion. There is a void. Thiel won, Gawker lost, never mind the truth... Thiel **is** gay. *And that’s okay!* Well, at least outside WSB it is.

Anyways, y’all be careful with the jovial gay-bashing right now. It’s unethical, but that reasoning falls on deaf ears here. So if that doesn’t resonate, then study the day a butthurt Thiel rage-fucked Gawker into oblivion. Your opponents will jump at the earliest opportunity to serve you a coup de gras with a side of virtue-signaling.

Thiel is to Gawker as Left is to WSB",0.087,0.838,0.075,-0.5502

First, there are dividends that come from these securities - for these you'll see a non-resident tax deducted from your account as a result of owning them within a non-registered account (Personal, Joint, or Corporate), TFSA or RESP. This is because these accounts are not recognized by the US. Despite this tax, there is no requirement to file any forms with the IRS.

please please please google the greeks for options, read or watch a short video

your enemy on your calls right now is theta, they will get eaten by it as it is the time component of your contracts.

You should come up with a plan today and tomorrow of how you want to work your position, if they are 60c and GME stays above 60 they are ""in the money"" so you have the option (get it) of selling it for cash value or exercising it before or on expiration (providing you have the funds to do so) so a 60c contract would be the option to buy 100 shares at $60 each. A good thing to think through today would be what price would you be happy profiting at...the time to think about this is now, as once you see a stock rising, and rising, etc, you may not think through enough to realize you could take your profit, and then 20 minutes later the stock gets slammed to 59 and now your options are worth less. The IV is gonna be incredible on these this week, which means that everyone will be paying more for the options, makes it harder to overcome cost of contract and profit.

If you are not interested in holding shares, then just sell it when you are happy with your profit this week, but as OP is saying, its gonna be a hell of a ride, so buckle in cowboy

If you want to buy GME, you will need the cash to cover the 100 shares. If you don't have the cash, DO NOT let it expire worthless

if this is your first time with options contracts please remember this:

**Consider SELLING THEM WHEN YOU ARE UP, take the profits, then keep learning.**

if you hold them, they will go down in value if the stock doesn't continue past $60

Many people, including myself, have spent money on contracts and held them past the perfect time to sell them for max profit...that's because no one knows the future, and human nature is to think that if you are making money, there's gotta be higher stock prices right around the corner.

You're correct. Unlucky-Prize is a paid shill. Been following him for a while.

""Unluck-prize is all like ""People don't pay enough attention to me and I get  downvoted, must be tribalism!"", ""WSB content is shit (shocking!) my  analysis is great, witness me!"".

Questions is why does this guy care so much and why he produces so much content on GME.

One  can come to a logical conclusion he's either an average trader with  superiority complex (which is fine) or a paid shill. His first post are  full of manipulative, fearmongering hyperbolic expressions in every  paragraph. When I called him out he adapted and changed the tone of his  messaging.

In his tribalism post  he's in essence complaining about not having enough influence over WSB  crowd. Really mate? Why would you fucking care? Do you get a bonus for a  number of upvotes or what?

If you dig deeper in his comments (just a few examples from memory) it's full of stuff like:

\-> Cohen is a founder, not a CEO - bearish

\-> Sherman is great - still bearish

\-> Uberkikz (Rod Alzmann ) and others DD posters not even amateurs, their DD sucks - bearish

\-> Institutional investors are not buying GME - bearish

\-> Price action is just a gamma squeeze - bearish

\-> Price action last week is just WSB buying- bearish

\-> there will be a MM catastrophic selling event (had little impact) - bearish

\-> MOASS is impossible - bearish

\-> shorts already covered - bearish

\-> Citron knows shorting and is legit - bearish

\-> We don't know if Melvin is really shorting - bearish

Then he claims he's net bullish. Fuck me, if that does not give paid shill vibes I don't know what does.

>A pro tip I have for this sub is – if you intend to hold a ton of long stock that is in high demand by short sellers, you should get paid to lend it to short sellers. That’s how the option dealers make a lot of their money – I’m sure citadel is making a killing holding a ton of GME stock to hedge, and promptly lending it to hedge funds at 30% borrow rate, while having very little risk. Most brokerages don’t pay you for lending your shares out, but IBKR does. 

This is beginning to sound suspicious. Nobody should be allowing shorts to borrow their shares. Driving up the cost to borrow and reducing the shortable float should be **prime** objectives for people long

&#x200B;

Retail investors own so many less shares than corporations. This is a corporate battle and the only reason retail investors are getting media coverage is because there are significantly more retail investors than usual on this trade vs. other trades. The reality is, I am a retail investor following some stranger's quality due diligence (with regard to Ryan Cohen, short volume, and historical data like VW 2008), and there is no universally agreed upon sale price, and any weight that WSB is exerting on this trade is minimal compared to institutional money.

What I see in this text is 1. an attempt to blame the whole fiasco on retail investors and escape corporate responsibility, and 2. people that don't understand the fervor for video games trying to temper the market. And to them I say: I bought the dip and you can too.

I am an unemployed student and I am better off than the majority of retail investors. I own 172 shares at an average cost of 41.18, and sale price of 420.69 is peanut money compared to what corporations will earn and compared to what I plan to sell at. I am fully leveraged, using my rent money and a credit card advance. Retail investors have zero control over the market; we are just lucky enough to have caught the sewer tsunami.

I’m not sure when it’ll start kicking in but theta decay occurs as the option loses theta value, meaning there’s less time left on it meaning there isn’t as much potential value.

2633,OR,"Okay,

To clear some of this up. IRAs and Roth IRAs treat growth the exact same way. There are no capital gains within either type of IRA. With a traditional IRA, you take the deduction on the front end (if your income falls below the deductibility limits) and you grow every year tax-deferred, then when you pull the money out you pay ordinary income tax. This is why its not beneficial to trade stocks in a pretax IRA. Capital gains rates are usually lower than income tax rates, and most certainly will be down the road as income tax rates rise. 

Roth IRAs also grow tax deferred and they are tax free upon withdrawal. You pay the taxes on the front end. Depending on your marital status, you may make too much money to contribute to a Roth IRA. They determine whether you can contribute to this by calculating your MAGI. Capital gains are included in thus calculation. Meaning gains this year could put you above the income limit and disqualify you from using a Roth IRA. THIS DOES NOT APPLY TO GAINS INSIDE OF IRA OR ROTH IRA. 

Your IRA and Roth IRA can grow as much as you want them to and they have no affect on your taxable income until you pull money out.

This is where a backdoor roth comes in. Contributing to an IRA and converting to a Roth IRA loses this year deductibility   but it allows ypu to take advantage of the biggest benefit offered by retirement accounts: Tax Deferral.",0.046,0.855,0.099,0.9012

It’s only grown and has consensus. At the time there still wasn't promising data to conclude HCQ's use. Why people grabbed onto the fake belief that it was effective is beyond me.  Maybe bc Donnie claimed it worked? As time went on there was _more_ data conclusively **against** HCQ's touted efficacy in treating COVID.

2817,CBOE,"GME Infinite Gamma Squeeze | Gap In Option Market Structure | Once In a Lifetime Opportunity

# Context

What happened last week with GME stock price and option was a combination of a gamma squeeze \[1\] and infinite short squeeze \[2\]. For the first time in financial history all GME call options are in the money (ITM) because the highest call strike price set by the CBOE for Januaray 29, 2021 is $60.

**Note:** A primer on gamma squeeze:

h[ttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2t9bf/gme\_i\_think\_this\_is\_a\_gamma\_squeeze\_where\_dealers/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2t9bf/gme_i_think_this_is_a_gamma_squeeze_where_dealers/)

Market Maker \[1\] are in a condition never observed in financial history. Hundred of thousands of retail (wsb) are buying the GME 60C across the options calendar and MM can't hedge properly because there are not enough GME shares to buy to properly financially hedge (accounting for the interest rate to borrow)

# Market Structure

To summarize the market structure:

1. Few GME shares to hedge.
2. Hundreds of thousands of (wsb) are buying the GME 60C because of the infinite short squeeze.
3. January 29, 2021 60C call option are the highest one on the option change for that date.
4. Conditions for Infinite Gamma Squeeze & Infinite Short Squeeze

As you may now realize --(MM and brokers) hope you don't -- there is a gap in the market structure that leaves them (MM/Citadel) vulnerable to massive losses.

# Infinite Gamma Squeeze

***Should*** **million of retails (wsb) buy the Januray 29, 2021 60C weekly on Monday, this will create an infinite gamma squeeze because MM still can't properly hedge, and are forced to buy shares at whatever price to hedge. MM doing so, forces brokers to margin call the shorts caught in their infinite short squeeze. Both conditions are pro-cyclical and feed on each other in an infinite feedback loop** ***so long as more an more retails buy the GME 60C.***

There is a chance that MM can dump the shares they bought to hedged the gamma steepening and call buying \[1\]. However, doing so does not make them market neutral. It effectively turns MM into a hedge fund. SEC may allow them to get away from this momentarily.

**However, after the MM dump shares in an attempt to stop the infinite gamma squeeze they will be net short GME shares and unhedged/not market neutral.** If after the MM dump, retails continue to buy GME shares up to the $60 price, MM will be caught in a *exponentially worse gamma squeeze*, which should GME go pass 60C (gamma bump) on the week of January 25, it would turn into the one of biggest tail risk event for the MM/Citidal.

**tldr;**

**There is a gap in the market structure so that if millions of retails buy Januray 29 GME 60C on January 25 2021, there is a high probability of both an infinite gamma and short squeeze. This has never happened in financial history. And should millions of retail buy the January 29 GME60C 2021, the losses for MM but profits for retail will be massive. Retails could see 100000% return on their weekly GME Januray 29 call options at the highest strike price.**

**Edit1:** Apparently there may be higher call prices for the January 29 2021 option chains. Fundamentally, this analysis is still correct. Should millions of retail all choose a common higher call strike price to buy (higher than 60C), the gamma squeeze will be triggered when that prices is hit.

Example:

Should millions of retail buy the January 29 70C or January 29 75C, and the infinite short squeeze continues. If the GME 70C or 75C is hit, GME share price enters a gamma squeeze.

What the MM are hoping for are twofolds:

1. They scare retails to sell below $60. This alleviates the infinite gamma squeeze. Or;
2. Retails don't all buy the same call options. But given that wsb loves high risk, I hypothesize they will all choose the furthest OTM call options.

GME at 60 is the Maginot line next week. Should it go to 75, gamma and infinite short squeeze continues. Should it fall below it, MM have won a strategic victory.

**Edit2:**

For gamma squeeze, you look at the open interest (OI) and strike price. Should the share price get close to the price with a highest open interest, that's when the gamma steepening occurs as probability goes to 1. MM have to buy shares to remain neutral as the options are now ITM.

Two things that stood out to me that would seriously help reduce the float. 

The first is their strategy about increasing free cash flow. It’s working even in the tough few quarters caused by COVID. If they have more free cash flow, they can increase dividends (good for boomer interest and great for float if everyone sets it to DRIP). 

The second is the fact that the freaking Finnish government is buying the stock after explicitly saying they wouldn’t a while back. Although there is speculation as to why, one hypothesis is that the Finnish government is afraid of basically a hostile takeover by the US government. They know the US vs. China is about to be the economic Cold War of the 21st century so the US needs 5G/6g that can compete with Huawei and there’s nothing the US government loves more than CONTROL.

3016,AI,"NNOX is interesting. They are a medical imaging company with a vision of “preventative healthcare through early detection”. The OTM calls (I haven’t verified them, but I’ll take your word on that) is probably due to a “Second Opinion” AI they demonstrated in a virtual radiology conference on Jan 6th, 2021. (I couldn’t find a link to the actual demo, but the other company demos are [here.](https://www.nanox.vision)) 

They have some interesting tech. Their electron source is not filament-based (normal ones use a heavy metal filament, such as tantalum, and run a current through it like a lightbulb, then they slam those electrons into an x-ray emitting material using magnets. Filaments like those generate a lot of free electrons randomly, so the x-rays generated can’t easily be controlled. Control≈resolution.) They claim the nanotechnology electron source is digital, allowing them more control over the electrons generated. In the demo, they used less power to generate the image, so that might be true.

Their 3-D imaging device looks cool. High res images they can shuffle through layers to see different things. In that demo, they said they don’t have approval for the 3-D imaging device they created, but from what I understand device approval is easier to get when there are similar devices, so that may not be a huge obstacle. (Tons of imaging devices out there.)

I’m guessing there will be a short bull run as news of it picks up and gets translated into mainstream media. However, since they are in the medical research field and haven’t/won’t post a profit for some time, don’t expect it to go to the moon in the short term. Good long term bet tho.

I’m not an expert, this is not advice, I’m just an internet autist with a physics degree I don’t use. Please don’t sue me for my Wendy’s paycheck if you lose all your tendies, I don’t have enough to share. That being said, I might pick some shares up for the long haul to the moon in 2-5 years.

The rumors of Apple teaming up w/ Hyundai is stupid- South Koreans love Samsung, and Apple hates agnosticism. If they even enter the market, they will be late and alienate users. Cross them off.

Amazon is the big data company that can monetize the entire deal 100x over. They also don't have an OS, but they are getting in game right now before Apple, Microsoft and Google try and pry away at the sector. They already destroyed their competitors with Alexa.

IVY is built on QNX. Some 🌈🐻wrote an article a couple days ago saying BB is ditching QNX for IVY and that's a ""problem,"" that's wrong, IVY is an evolution, a next-gen system.

Lastly, the patent portfolio can protect BB. They can license patents for money and collect on every car sold. BB was ahead of the game with this pivot.

3082,API,">Actually, this is quite different from what QNX has been doing traditionally. So, we announced IVY, which is the intelligent vehicle everywhere. So, IVY is a cloud-connected and cross platform that is multi-OS, multi-cloud, in-car software that allows automakers to access a vehicle sensor data in compliance with safety and security requirements to process that data with updatable code to create new vehicle insights and then share those insights with developers through a consistent and simple in-car API mechanism.

...

>Right. So, it's a 50-50 joint development. And something I didn't stress enough in the last question, just to be clear, this is OS and cloud agnostic. No dependency on AWS cloud and no dependency on QNX. This is truly a generic piece of middleware to create this ecosystem. So, obviously, we're doing development on QNX. We expect QNX to be the high runner within the vehicle because of our dominant position in the car. I mean, this is part of the reason that AWS is very interested in working with us.

3127,GME,"You'll get margin called if your account value falls under a specific number. This number is 

(amount you borrowed)/(1 - maintenance requirement).

Maintenance requirement is set by the broker and can vary from stock to stock. Usually it's like 25~50%.

So say you borrow $10k and GME is pretty volatile, so maintenance req is 45%. This means you have to keep your account value above (10,000)/(1 - 0.45) = $18,181. 

If your account dips under this number, you will get a notice from your broker that goes ""hey we need you to deposit cash into your account to bring it back up to the maintenance req"", and if you can't do that, you are forced to sell off shares to reduce the size of the loan. Bringing your account back up to maintenance is called ""covering"" which is a word you'll see a lot.

An assumption I'm making here is that someone who is yoloing 300 shares on margin is probably not very liquid. They probably don't have $100k sitting around to patch up their margin account if the stock price gets pushed down. On the short side, a hedge fund will have millions and millions sitting around to spend on maintenance, and portfolio managers can just keep pulling money until their boss stomps into their office and goes ""okay what the fuck are you doing"". So having margin buyers on the long side is very likely to be a net negative for us, it will pressure the price down harder than it will push the price up against the shorts.",0.046,0.878,0.076,0.5106
