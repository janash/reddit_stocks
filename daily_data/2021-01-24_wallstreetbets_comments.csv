15,GME,"You can only ""short"" a stock when its going up. You can't short a stock on red candles. Shorts arent only betting against the company stock price to fall, they are effectively putting pressure on the stock downward by short selling. In retard terms, they borrow stock from their broker for a daily borrowing rate, to temporarily sell the shares and tank a stock price. Then when it tanks because everyone else sells, they buy those shares back, and keep the profit in between.


Short squeezes happen when a short seller(or multiple) shorts a stock and the stock price rises. If it rises enough, the short sellers must buy the shares back, or their broker will for them due to margin, to cover their short position which ends up putting upward pressure on a stock causing a massive inflow of upward pressure due to a ""short squeeze"".

24,OVID,Yes OP did make a mistake. Closing out a loan account usually knocks your score down a few points if it’s an old loan because the average age of your credit accounts goes down.

You could defer mortgage payments here in Canada, which sounded great, but the details revealed they just tacked the deferred payments to the end of the loan, which will just end up costing you more in the long run, lol.

Maybe in the future we all get take out from the Game Stop restaurant. We buy all our clothes from Game Stop. The Game Stop Mall is a one stop shop for all the Game Stop purchases your family needs. Cars and Jewelry are only of good quality if they came from Game Stop.

Don't believe me? Look at the man's comment history. There are rarely any long comments. Sounds like someone trying not to fuck around with the time continuum, and keep the future on course. About a week ago he was asked if he would use his 1.2M$ in cash for GME shares, and he simply replied,

Maybe I will.

Over a year ago a guy pointed out that he was losing money on GME, and pointed out several reasons for it's poor performance. He simply replied,

January 2021.

This is the reply of a man who knows the future. He doesn't understand that there are other bets to make because this Game Stop meme stock will literally let them overtake every single market they enter starting from Jan 2021. And that appears to be the only important date he knows.

So as a future man he began to YOLO everything into GME before 2021 turned the corner. He didn't care about the spread sheets and cost analysis reports. He was just an autist retard from the future that knew Game Stop would one day own the world, and that it all began in Jan of 2021.

He's turned 10's of thousands of dollars into over 10 million dollars, and he still isn't pulling out. This man knows something, and we need to YOLO into GME now if we want to be millionairs after a year too.",0.124,0.807,0.069,-0.9573

First of all, is this link dated 12/8/2020 relevant to the anticipated GME offering? 🚀 🚀

Second of all, one of the major fears is that a GME stock offering will tank the market price, but I am anticipating them to do so at prices upwards of $300-- this is theoretically infinite, after all, and our hands are made of diamond.

based on the 100mil cap, that is at most 300k shares... which is NOTHING compared to short float! 🚀 🚀 🚀 significantly more shorts left on friday already (I think? so fucking hard to find info on that)

BUT 100mil is only 1/5 of their debt... I guess they fucked up with this planned offering and didnt expect such astronomical heights, heights made possibly by our sexy diamond hands. 🚀 🚀 🚀

Someone explain to me why im wrong and shouldnt be even more bullish than ever.

154,FIVE,"Copying from u/NrdRage 

So one of the interesting things that happened yesterday with that Gamma squeeze is that it revealed....the sellers had largely given up (this is important, I promise)


Yesterday morning, there was a large sell wall at 49.50 that I did NOT think $GME was going to be able break through.  So much so that I actually opened a short position at 49.27 in anticipation of bouncing off of it and falling to 45.


That sell wall wasn't defeated, but the entity that put it in place removed it, which is why the stock blew right through and didn't slow down again until about 52.  The important thing, though, was that the next sell wall?  Wasn't until EIGHTY FIVE.  I've never closed a short position so quickly in my life.  The moment I saw it at 50.58 I knew there was no resistance at all and I took my loss immediately.


The removal of that wall was a total capitulation by sellers, who waved the white flag.  Had it not been for the circuit breakers, $GME would have ABSOLUTELY gotten over 100 yesterday.  The only reason it closed as low as it did yesterday was because retail investors aren't used to seeing circuit breakers.  They don't understand them or why they're in place.  So it scared them.  Because why wouldn't it be scary when a stock stops trading?  That gave people who weren't even really looking at GME a few minutes to prepare to open large short positions, which is why you saw the stock absolutely plummet after the 2nd breaker - so much so that it triggered a downside breaker.    But if you look at the sell-side during that downswing, it was all tiny sell orders.  50 shares here, 100 shares there, some 20's, etc.  It was  🧻🤚 running for the hills because they didn't understand what was happening.  So even after that 2nd breaker, there was no real conviction on the sell side.  Which is why the stock was able to rebound to 65 from 57.


This is all a very long TL:DR of saying everybody keeps saying 420.69 as a joke, but....I wouldn't laugh if I were you, because when these squeezes and margin calls happen, there's absolutely no sell conviction to keep the price from skyrocketing.

155,GME,"Copying from u/NrdRage 

So one of the interesting things that happened yesterday with that Gamma squeeze is that it revealed....the sellers had largely given up (this is important, I promise)


Yesterday morning, there was a large sell wall at 49.50 that I did NOT think $GME was going to be able break through.  So much so that I actually opened a short position at 49.27 in anticipation of bouncing off of it and falling to 45.


That sell wall wasn't defeated, but the entity that put it in place removed it, which is why the stock blew right through and didn't slow down again until about 52.  The important thing, though, was that the next sell wall?  Wasn't until EIGHTY FIVE.  I've never closed a short position so quickly in my life.  The moment I saw it at 50.58 I knew there was no resistance at all and I took my loss immediately.


The removal of that wall was a total capitulation by sellers, who waved the white flag.  Had it not been for the circuit breakers, $GME would have ABSOLUTELY gotten over 100 yesterday.  The only reason it closed as low as it did yesterday was because retail investors aren't used to seeing circuit breakers.  They don't understand them or why they're in place.  So it scared them.  Because why wouldn't it be scary when a stock stops trading?  That gave people who weren't even really looking at GME a few minutes to prepare to open large short positions, which is why you saw the stock absolutely plummet after the 2nd breaker - so much so that it triggered a downside breaker.    But if you look at the sell-side during that downswing, it was all tiny sell orders.  50 shares here, 100 shares there, some 20's, etc.  It was  🧻🤚 running for the hills because they didn't understand what was happening.

Right now mine is set to 54%, when I wake up on Monday the market will already be closed because I'm going to ship time zone but it doesn't matter to me at all because I'm just going to tighten my trailing stop order and then sleep like a baby waiting for Tuesday where I'm going to do it again. This isn't a fad this is a sophisticated play where we corner the boomers who bet on a bankruptcy. The zoomers who are foaming in right now thanks to YouTube tiktok and discord are hardly even making a dent in the amount of money that the 🌈🐻 are going to be losing because despite what Wall Street bets says, it's not retail versus Wall Street. it's Wall Street versus Wall Street and we're on the side of the winning funds like Fidelity BlackRock and vanguard. Absolutely none of them bought GameStop shares for the purpose of squeezing and selling the peak, they did it because they realized that GameStop is going to liquidate stores, switch their game selling model to e-commerce, fill their retail locations with Xboxes PlayStations PCS and peripherals, turn cash inyo in logistics just like RC did with chewy, and then beat micro center and Best buy by offering exclusive bundles combining their hardware and software. Remember this mother f***** beat Amazon. HE BUILT THE MARK 1 (chewy) IN A F****** CAVE because he understands e-commerce and logistics.

Think about how big the gaming industry right now is and remember that in 2018 the custom built online pc sale portion of the market was around 50 million dollars. GameStop's new plan is to have a single distribution center connected to a couple of retail locations so that they can move computer parts PlayStations Xboxes and Nintendo products at lightning speed to consumers. The age of spending weeks picking out parts on PC part picker and then waiting another two weeks for all the parts to arrive from Amazon is over. within one year from now all you're going to have to do is go to the GameStop website pick a budget click on parts drive over there one day later to pick up your PC and grab a free copy of cyberpunk 2077 on the way out the door.

The good due diligences is that I've read estimate somewhere between 140 and 184 per share by the end of the year, most likely somewhere around 169.

When a big stockholder sells, the stock price will go up creating even more pressure on those who still bet against GME because it becomes increasingly expensive to do so.

People in WSB have been talking about a short squeeze potential in GME for a while now. Here's a [Aug 2020 video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alntJzg0Um4) from DFV discussing it and I believe I've seen it discussed even earlier. I'm certain the big players were well aware of the potential and have been thinking through how they can profit from it.

At most, retail interest may be accelerating a potential short squeeze through buying activity. And if such a squeeze happens, the real money will be made by the big players. Many of them have already been bleeding the short sellers through interest on borrowed shares and might even prefer to draw out the closing of shorts so they can first capture some more interest payments before squeezing them in short closing.",0.0,0.863,0.137,0.9817

A while ago u/Deepfuckingvalue posted his thesis that gamestop was not in fact worthless, and was extremely undervalued at current levels because of the massive shorting.

The lower you sell during the actual MOASS (what we're seeing at the moment are gamma squeezes) the more the growth of the squeeze will be stunted.

523,GME,"Also from the UK my bro: options are a little complicated to explain but are essentially a bet that a stock will reach a certain price before a certain date. We can get them here with a couple of brokers (search the UK investing sub for a while to find them), specifically US brokers who operate here.

Right now most people are buying stocks because they help with the short squeeze. The massive gains you see are likely call options though (‘calls’ are bets that the stock will go up, ‘puts’ are bets that they’ll go down).

If you see people talking about GME 1/27 100c, for example, those are calls that GME will hit 100 by 27th of January (stupid America dating system).

526,UK,"Let's say Initech stock is $100 on monday.  
You can agree with someone to buy 1000 shares of Initech stock for $110 each on friday (Ie, that's an option to buy). They set a price for this option, let's say you pay them $5000.  
If the stock hasnt gone up over $110 on friday your option is now worthless (you dont need to use it, because if you did you'd have to pay more per stock than it's worth).  
But if the stock is worth $125 then you can use the option, buy for $110k and immediately sell for $125k, making a profit of $15k minus the $5k you paid for the option.  
Of course in this scenario you could also just have bought stocks for $100 on monday and sold for $125k on friday.  
But if the price goes down, in the case of the option you're only down the price of the option, but if you bought stocks you can potentially lose any amount, eg if the stock nosedives to $50 before you decide to sell then you  lost a full $50k.

I have a degree in Computer Science,  I’ve engineered systems that run on Windows, Unix, Linux, containers using Docker and Kubernetes.  Open source software will always have more known vulnerabilities because the code base is easily viewed.  Many people with diverse engineering backgrounds can view that code.  This leads to more vulnerabilities being found, but also to more of those vulnerabilities being fixed, and fixed faster than closed source operating systems.

There’s a reason why Black Hat hackers love to take advantage of organizations that use windows.  It’s not that Linux is impossible to hack but exploiting windows is easier by an order of magnitude.  Those people that hack for profit usually take the path of least resistance to profit.

As of macOS Catalina Apple removed all old NeXTSTEP(based on BSD Unix 4.4) code and the OS is now entirely based on FreeBSD Unix with some Apple custom written code on top of it.

FreeBSD is an entirely open source operating system.  It has many contributors but not as many as Linux and is not as popular, it is still considered more secure by miles than the windows kernel.

Windows makes some very stupid architectural decisions when it comes to security.  Couple that with the performance of the windows kernel  vs the Linux kernel and you now know why most cloud providers exclusively offer Linux.

Microsoft relies on “capturing” your business and making it difficult to use other technologies as integrating with a Microsoft ecosystem is more opaque than say integrating Linux systems with FreeBSD.  Hell even the majority of Azure Cloud instances are running some kind of linux.

Integration is the name of the game in tech the tech world at the moment.  Any company not moving to the cloud and away from Microsoft is frankly behind the curve.

How does this relate to blackberry?  Blackberry devices use two operating systems Blackberry 10 and Android.  Blackberry 10 Based on QNX shown in this chart had its last release three years ago in April and the company has moved to android as of 2019.  Like Microsoft and their Azure Cloud Platform  Blackberry sees that custom homegrown closed source operating systems are dying.  I have a feeling that before the end of the decade Microsoft Windows will either be defunct or will no longer use the closed source NT kernel and be a distribution of Linux or based on some kind of Unix.

Tech companies are seeing the writing on the wall folks the open source operating system revolution isn’t just a passing fad but a trend that’s been on the rise for years.  Don’t bet on the losers folks, bet on where the tech industry is innovating, open source software and platforms.

You're correct. Unlucky-Prize is a paid shill. Been following him for a while.

I'll just quote my past comment summarizing his behaviour (reply to his post on WSB tribalism):

""Unluck-prize is all like ""People don't pay enough attention to me and I get  downvoted, must be tribalism!"", ""WSB content is shit (shocking!) my  analysis is great, witness me!"".

Questions is why does this guy care so much and why he produces so much content on GME.

One  can come to a logical conclusion he's either an average trader with  superiority complex (which is fine) or a paid shill. His first post are  full of manipulative, fearmongering hyperbolic expressions in every  paragraph. When I called him out he adapted and changed the tone of his  messaging.

In his tribalism post  he's in essence complaining about not having enough influence over WSB  crowd. Really mate? Why would you fucking care? Do you get a bonus for a  number of upvotes or what?

If you dig deeper in his comments (just a few examples from memory) it's full of stuff like:

\-> Cohen is a founder, not a CEO - bearish

\-> Sherman is great - still bearish

\-> Uberkikz (Rod Alzmann ) and others DD posters not even amateurs, their DD sucks - bearish

\-> Institutional investors are not buying GME - bearish

\-> Price action is just a gamma squeeze - bearish

\-> Price action last week is just WSB buying- bearish

\-> there will be a MM catastrophic selling event (had little impact) - bearish

\-> MOASS is impossible - bearish

\-> shorts already covered - bearish

\-> Citron knows shorting and is legit - bearish

\-> We don't know if Melvin is really shorting - bearish

""Unluck-prize is all like ""People don't pay enough attention to me and I get  downvoted, must be tribalism!"", ""WSB content is shit (shocking!) my  analysis is great, witness me!"".

Questions is why does this guy care so much and why he produces so much content on GME.

One  can come to a logical conclusion he's either an average trader with  superiority complex (which is fine) or a paid shill. His first post are  full of manipulative, fearmongering hyperbolic expressions in every  paragraph. When I called him out he adapted and changed the tone of his  messaging.

In his tribalism post  he's in essence complaining about not having enough influence over WSB  crowd. Really mate? Why would you fucking care? Do you get a bonus for a  number of upvotes or what?

If you dig deeper in his comments (just a few examples from memory) it's full of stuff like:

\-> Cohen is a founder, not a CEO - bearish

\-> Sherman is great - still bearish

\-> Uberkikz (Rod Alzmann ) and others DD posters not even amateurs, their DD sucks - bearish

\-> Institutional investors are not buying GME - bearish

\-> Price action is just a gamma squeeze - bearish

\-> Price action last week is just WSB buying- bearish

\-> there will be a MM catastrophic selling event (had little impact) - bearish

\-> MOASS is impossible - bearish

\-> shorts already covered - bearish

\-> Citron knows shorting and is legit - bearish

\-> We don't know if Melvin is really shorting - bearish

Then he claims he's net bullish. Fuck me, if that does not give paid shill vibes I don't know what does.",0.043,0.856,0.101,0.9567

Now, the interim hypothetical mid week squeeze *might* be enough to get some smaller hedge funds margin called on their shorts.  But, the big guys are going to ride it out.

Reddit could very well shut down this subreddit if it got enough heat from the SEC.

There is not a single fraud rule that applies to what is currently happening on WSB - there is no fraudulent information deliberately being dispersed, insider trading, NO part within the whole gamut of fraud. OTOH, the SEC frequently issues advisories that could create new precedent that would apply to social media and the things we see on WSB. Seems like a stretch to me though. But Reddit pushing against the SEC also seems like a stretch in the event that the two did come to a head. On a more practical level, the SEC would probably say fuck all and leave because everyone on this Reddit would just migrate elsewhere.

It will collapse and fall back down to $20.

No. You won’t.

It's possible that the majority of people who wanted in on GME are already maxed out. If thats the case - it could trade sideways or even down early next week.

Image if it trades slightly down for 1 or 2 days and the promised short squeeze doesn't happen. Then all the shares from this weeks ITM call options are delivered on Tuesday and those people take profits, pushing the stock slightly down. Then some bulls who put all their net worth into GME lose interest and start taking just a little bit of cash off the table.

By this point you've had many days of sideways or downwards action AND the available float for shorting is increasing. Eventually things snap and those who joined the meme train make a run for the exits, crashing the stock down to the prices where either shorts have to take profit or value investors step in.

So when you reap in those tasty tendies and later realize that you made too much taxable income,  you will have to pull the excess contribution out ALONG with the gains, get taxed on that income and incur an additional tax penalty for being a tard.

Earlier this month I made a 3k 2021 contribution.  I have GME in taxable accounts and my ROTH.  My gains in the taxable accounts already disqualify me from a ROTH contribution.

I was also curious about what's going on with that from a learning POV.

The other two that sold some still have a good amount left.

But yeah, always selling to zero shares seems a bit odd as a CFO no? But since he always does this it's probably not a bad sign at all. Maybe he just doesn't like to hold shares as the financial officer, but is this a common occurrence? Just wondering why head finance honcho don't want any.

I just watched the recent interview with Larry Summers on Boomerberg. The interviewer brought up the GME squeeze.

We here all know this is absolute bullshit, that any such regulation would be because we made institutional money look bad. If anything, WSB is most analogous to an old-school self-directed investment club, which the SEC has given the green light to for decades: https://www.sec.gov/reportspubs/investor-publications/investorpubsinvclubhtm.html

The 1/22 22C means that he had am option position (a call) that he purchased a while ago where on 1/22 he bet that GME would exceed 22$ a share. As we can see, it very much. So for every contract he had, you multiply that by the total dollar difference of current price over the $22 strike price. So if GME ended at $65 a share he would have made $43 (65-22). I dont have the specifics obviously on what exactly amount was made, but just know that contracts consist of 100 shares. So if he bought 5 contracts at 22C, he would be able to buy the shares at 22$ (500 shares) and sell them for 65$ a share. so $43 x 500 = 21.5k in profit alone.

1) Don't put your entire portfolio into options. Try around 20-30% and rest buy shares

2) Set an expiration date that's at least 2mon out. The further the date the more time you have to exit your position with minimal loss. Also means less gains but better safe than sorry

3) Don't look at other peoples gain porn too much. It'll make you think you can have the same success but you most likely wont

So lets say for example you like a stock like BB and have $10k, put $7k into shares, $2k into $15/16C expiring in March/April, $1k into $14/15C expiring in end of Feb/early March

Snowflakes revenue growth tripled in last year. I’m sure did a lot in prior pre ipo years. Their quarterly growth is still very high. 


BB revenue has been falling significantly for a long time. 2.5b in 2016. 900m in 2019. 1b in 2020 In a nice surprise.

12 months ago, you made a truly retarded and life-altering decision, on the basis of gut feelings and autism so pure if it was cocaine it’d kill.

But it was a decision so autistic you’ve breached the savant category and have treaded into u/DeepFuckingValue waters.

**Here’s a list of what to do now if you don’t know already or if you don’t already have a plan:**

1. Pay off debt.

2. Stash as much in retirement accounts as you can. Max 2 Roth IRAs for 2021, 2022, and 2023 if possible. Max your 401k at $19,000 for 2022, and do it again in 2023.

3. Invest the rest in index funds in a taxable brokerage account.

4. Use part of it as down payment on property.

5. Put some in savings for the possible education expenses.

6. Follow the steps and the flow chart in the wiki on the sidebar: “PRIME DIRECTIVE: How to handle $”.

7. Optional: Donate some to me. A stranger. 
Someone who you have never met, just out of the good in your heart, if there is any. ( 🤷‍♂️ Worth a try)

2088,GOOD,"**Godspeed.** u/CptStarFall

12 months ago, you made a truly retarded and life-altering decision, on the basis of gut feelings and autism so pure if it was cocaine it’d kill.

But it was a decision so autistic you’ve breached the savant category and have treaded into u/DeepFuckingValue waters.

**Here’s a list of what to do now if you don’t know already or if you don’t already have a plan:**

1. Pay off debt.

2. Stash as much in retirement accounts as you can. Max 2 Roth IRAs for 2021, 2022, and 2023 if possible. Max your 401k at $19,000 for 2022, and do it again in 2023.

3. Invest the rest in index funds in a taxable brokerage account.

4. Use part of it as down payment on property.

5. Put some in savings for the possible education expenses.

6. Follow the steps and the flow chart in the wiki on the sidebar: “PRIME DIRECTIVE: How to handle $”.

7. Optional: Donate some to me. A stranger. 
Someone who you have never met, just out of the good in your heart, if there is any. ( 🤷‍♂️ Worth a try)

[Follow this link for more information. It is a very fantastic resource that has been tried and tested countless times and shared by many.](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics)

**Good luck.**

**PHILOSOPHICAL FEEL-GOOD SHIT**

You are a very, very lucky man. Enjoy your life.
Leave while you still can. 

What you have done has set you on such a good path in life that from here on out, you will **never experience the worries** that other people have. Any offspring you will have will go on to be better people due to the actions you have taken and you yourself will improve the general well-being of the people around you.

You have achieved what many do not, and never will.

Before the gamma squeeze feeding into the short squeeze (creating the gamma short feedback squeeze, I'm coining that term now), shorts still believed in their bear thesis.

But now, the gamma squeeze is driving the price higher and taking even more shares off the table to be traded, which is making MMs nervous. We're getting really close to the point where there will be so little liquidity that MMs are likelier to margin call their clients, including the shorts, just to hedge against open option positions, thereby triggering the short squeeze thanks to a gamma squeeze.

Shorts are paying interest on the shares they shorted, and the big firms have a ton of money to keep doing to to ride out the storm because they still believe in their bear thesis. To them, this is just a ""dip"" in the stock price. But as soon as that bear thesis is concretely destroyed, they will close out their positions.

Before the gamma squeeze feeding into the short squeeze (creating the gamma short feedback squeeze, I'm coining that term now), shorts still believed in their bear thesis. This meant we were waiting for GME or RC to release some piece of positive news that would destroy that bear thesis, which would've forced the shorts to abandon their current short play and unwind their position.

2360,PLTR,"**History Refresher:**
Today, WSB falls under its greatest scrutiny, most of which can be attributed to the chagrin of a few large institutional opponents. So, let’s pause for a moment and reflect upon a time not too long ago when another online safe-house slid into similar cross-hairs.  

Let’s start with PLTR. Many of you homophobic retards are too young to remember, but wayyy back in 2016 PLTR’s cofounder *Peter Thiel* quietly bankrolled litigation against an online news forum called Gawker. These law suits tackled [sex tapes, Hulk Hogan, and other random salacious shit](https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattdrange/2016/06/21/peter-thiels-war-on-gawker-a-timeline/), but nothing related to the PLTR cofounder himself?  *So, why did Thiel finance the legal attack against Gawker?* To find the answer, we must go back a decade earlier when Gawker ran a story under the headline “Peter Thiel is totally gay, people.” Gawker outted Thiel. Thiel exacted his petty revenge, as all feisty gays will do.

As history would have it, those lawsuits ultimately shut Gawker down. And today, a half decade later, Gawker has not reassembled in any similar fashion. There is a void. Thiel won, Gawker lost, never mind the truth... Thiel **is** gay. *And that’s okay!* Well, at least outside WSB it is.

Anyways, y’all be careful with the jovial gay-bashing right now. It’s unethical, but that reasoning falls on deaf ears here. So if that doesn’t resonate, then study the day a butthurt Thiel rage-fucked Gawker into oblivion. Your opponents will jump at the earliest opportunity to serve you a coup de gras with a side of virtue-signaling.

Thiel is to Gawker as Left is to WSB",0.087,0.838,0.075,-0.5502

please please please google the greeks for options, read or watch a short video

your enemy on your calls right now is theta, they will get eaten by it as it is the time component of your contracts.

You should come up with a plan today and tomorrow of how you want to work your position, if they are 60c and GME stays above 60 they are ""in the money"" so you have the option (get it) of selling it for cash value or exercising it before or on expiration (providing you have the funds to do so) so a 60c contract would be the option to buy 100 shares at $60 each. A good thing to think through today would be what price would you be happy profiting at...the time to think about this is now, as once you see a stock rising, and rising, etc, you may not think through enough to realize you could take your profit, and then 20 minutes later the stock gets slammed to 59 and now your options are worth less. The IV is gonna be incredible on these this week, which means that everyone will be paying more for the options, makes it harder to overcome cost of contract and profit.

If you are not interested in holding shares, then just sell it when you are happy with your profit this week, but as OP is saying, its gonna be a hell of a ride, so buckle in cowboy

If you want to buy GME, you will need the cash to cover the 100 shares. If you don't have the cash, DO NOT let it expire worthless

if this is your first time with options contracts please remember this:

**Consider SELLING THEM WHEN YOU ARE UP, take the profits, then keep learning.**

if you hold them, they will go down in value if the stock doesn't continue past $60

Many people, including myself, have spent money on contracts and held them past the perfect time to sell them for max profit...that's because no one knows the future, and human nature is to think that if you are making money, there's gotta be higher stock prices right around the corner. If you are not careful they will very quickly get destroyed if the stock does not stay above your 60 strike

You're correct. Unlucky-Prize is a paid shill. Been following him for a while.

""Unluck-prize is all like ""People don't pay enough attention to me and I get  downvoted, must be tribalism!"", ""WSB content is shit (shocking!) my  analysis is great, witness me!"".

Questions is why does this guy care so much and why he produces so much content on GME.

One  can come to a logical conclusion he's either an average trader with  superiority complex (which is fine) or a paid shill. His first post are  full of manipulative, fearmongering hyperbolic expressions in every  paragraph. When I called him out he adapted and changed the tone of his  messaging.

In his tribalism post  he's in essence complaining about not having enough influence over WSB  crowd. Really mate? Why would you fucking care? Do you get a bonus for a  number of upvotes or what?

If you dig deeper in his comments (just a few examples from memory) it's full of stuff like:

\-> Cohen is a founder, not a CEO - bearish

\-> Sherman is great - still bearish

\-> Uberkikz (Rod Alzmann ) and others DD posters not even amateurs, their DD sucks - bearish

\-> Institutional investors are not buying GME - bearish

\-> Price action is just a gamma squeeze - bearish

\-> Price action last week is just WSB buying- bearish

\-> there will be a MM catastrophic selling event (had little impact) - bearish

\-> MOASS is impossible - bearish

\-> shorts already covered - bearish

\-> Citron knows shorting and is legit - bearish

\-> We don't know if Melvin is really shorting - bearish

Then he claims he's net bullish. Fuck me, if that does not give paid shill vibes I don't know what does.

>One other thing - contrary to what I sometimes read, Melvin Capital was already squeezed, or rather, their dealer was by proxy. Wednesday was that squeeze. They bought a bunch of ITM put options which forced dealers to sell a ton of stock to hedge. When the price shot up, dealers bought into that short they made to hedge the Melvin puts, and now the Melvin puts expired worthless. Melvin can not be squeezed further unless they enter a new short position of some type. 

Ok, so Melvin bought puts and then their dealer got squeezed and the Melvin puts expired worthless. So what? that doesn't say anything about Melvin's core short stock position, those puts weren't Melvin hedges, and so Melvin's short position remains squeezable. 

Not sure why you'd say that.

>Yield Enhancement Program

>A pro tip I have for this sub is – if you intend to hold a ton of long stock that is in high demand by short sellers, you should get paid to lend it to short sellers. That’s how the option dealers make a lot of their money – I’m sure citadel is making a killing holding a ton of GME stock to hedge, and promptly lending it to hedge funds at 30% borrow rate, while having very little risk. Most brokerages don’t pay you for lending your shares out, but IBKR does. 

This is beginning to sound suspicious. Nobody should be allowing shorts to borrow their shares. Driving up the cost to borrow and reducing the shortable float should be **prime** objectives for people long

2550,IBKR,"Third poster tracking down yet another manipulation thread of his. That is three users so far over multiple threads of his:

>One other thing - contrary to what I sometimes read, Melvin Capital was already squeezed, or rather, their dealer was by proxy. Wednesday was that squeeze. They bought a bunch of ITM put options which forced dealers to sell a ton of stock to hedge. When the price shot up, dealers bought into that short they made to hedge the Melvin puts, and now the Melvin puts expired worthless. Melvin can not be squeezed further unless they enter a new short position of some type. 

Ok, so Melvin bought puts and then their dealer got squeezed and the Melvin puts expired worthless. So what? that doesn't say anything about Melvin's core short stock position, those puts weren't Melvin hedges, and so Melvin's short position remains squeezable. 

Not sure why you'd say that.

A year LEAP has tons of theta VALUE, because there’s so much time left on it. If you look at the options you’ll notice theta is 0, meaning it’s not decaying at all for quite a while. 

I’m not sure when it’ll start kicking in but theta decay occurs as the option loses theta value, meaning there’s less time left on it meaning there isn’t as much potential value.

As the option gets closer to expiry, theta will go to -.01 and start losing a dollar in value a day at some point which is about where I’d consider getting rid of it",0.113,0.766,0.122,0.3034

&#x200B;

Retail investors own so many less shares than corporations. This is a corporate battle and the only reason retail investors are getting media coverage is because there are significantly more retail investors than usual on this trade vs. other trades. The reality is, I am a retail investor following some stranger's quality due diligence (with regard to Ryan Cohen, short volume, and historical data like VW 2008), and there is no universally agreed upon sale price, and any weight that WSB is exerting on this trade is minimal compared to institutional money.

What I see in this text is 1. an attempt to blame the whole fiasco on retail investors and escape corporate responsibility, and 2. people that don't understand the fervor for video games trying to temper the market. And to them I say: I bought the dip and you can too.

I am an unemployed student and I am better off than the majority of retail investors. I own 172 shares at an average cost of 41.18, and sale price of 420.69 is peanut money compared to what corporations will earn and compared to what I plan to sell at. I am fully leveraged, using my rent money and a credit card advance. Retail investors have zero control over the market; we are just lucky enough to have caught the sewer tsunami.

2783,OR,"Okay,

To clear some of this up. IRAs and Roth IRAs treat growth the exact same way. There are no capital gains within either type of IRA. With a traditional IRA, you take the deduction on the front end (if your income falls below the deductibility limits) and you grow every year tax-deferred, then when you pull the money out you pay ordinary income tax. This is why its not beneficial to trade stocks in a pretax IRA. Capital gains rates are usually lower than income tax rates, and most certainly will be down the road as income tax rates rise. 

Roth IRAs also grow tax deferred and they are tax free upon withdrawal. You pay the taxes on the front end. Depending on your marital status, you may make too much money to contribute to a Roth IRA. They determine whether you can contribute to this by calculating your MAGI. Capital gains are included in thus calculation. Meaning gains this year could put you above the income limit and disqualify you from using a Roth IRA. THIS DOES NOT APPLY TO GAINS INSIDE OF IRA OR ROTH IRA. 

Your IRA and Roth IRA can grow as much as you want them to and they have no affect on your taxable income until you pull money out.

This is where a backdoor roth comes in. Contributing to an IRA and converting to a Roth IRA loses this year deductibility   but it allows ypu to take advantage of the biggest benefit offered by retirement accounts: Tax Deferral.",0.046,0.855,0.099,0.9012

The rumors of Apple teaming up w/ Hyundai is stupid- South Koreans love Samsung, and Apple hates agnosticism. If they even enter the market, they will be late and alienate users. Cross them off.

Amazon is the big data company that can monetize the entire deal 100x over. They also don't have an OS, but they are getting in game right now before Apple, Microsoft and Google try and pry away at the sector. They already destroyed their competitors with Alexa.

IVY is built on QNX. Some 🌈🐻wrote an article a couple days ago saying BB is ditching QNX for IVY and that's a ""problem,"" that's wrong, IVY is an evolution, a next-gen system.

So, IVY is a cloud-connected and cross platform that is multi-OS, multi-cloud, in-car software that allows automakers to access a vehicle sensor data in compliance with safety and security requirements to process that data with updatable code to create new vehicle insights and then share those insights with developers through a consistent and simple in-car API mechanism.

...

>Right. So, it's a 50-50 joint development. And something I didn't stress enough in the last question, just to be clear, this is OS and cloud agnostic. No dependency on AWS cloud and no dependency on QNX. This is truly a generic piece of middleware to create this ecosystem. So, obviously, we're doing development on QNX. We expect QNX to be the high runner within the vehicle because of our dominant position in the car. I mean, this is part of the reason that AWS is very interested in working with us.

It’s only grown and has consensus. At the time there still wasn't promising data to conclude HCQ's use. Why people grabbed onto the fake belief that it was effective is beyond me.  Maybe bc Donnie claimed it worked? As time went on there was _more_ data conclusively **against** HCQ's touted efficacy in treating COVID.

2928,CBOE,"GME Infinite Gamma Squeeze | Gap In Option Market Structure | Once In a Lifetime Opportunity

# Context

What happened last week with GME stock price and option was a combination of a gamma squeeze \[1\] and infinite short squeeze \[2\]. For the first time in financial history all GME call options are in the money (ITM) because the highest call strike price set by the CBOE for Januaray 29, 2021 is $60.

**Note:** A primer on gamma squeeze:

h[ttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2t9bf/gme\_i\_think\_this\_is\_a\_gamma\_squeeze\_where\_dealers/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2t9bf/gme_i_think_this_is_a_gamma_squeeze_where_dealers/)

Market Maker \[1\] are in a condition never observed in financial history. Hundred of thousands of retail (wsb) are buying the GME 60C across the options calendar and MM can't hedge properly because there are not enough GME shares to buy to properly financially hedge (accounting for the interest rate to borrow)

# Market Structure

To summarize the market structure:

1. Few GME shares to hedge.
2. Hundreds of thousands of (wsb) are buying the GME 60C because of the infinite short squeeze.
3. January 29, 2021 60C call option are the highest one on the option change for that date.
4. Conditions for Infinite Gamma Squeeze & Infinite Short Squeeze

As you may now realize --(MM and brokers) hope you don't -- there is a gap in the market structure that leaves them (MM/Citadel) vulnerable to massive losses.

# Infinite Gamma Squeeze

***Should*** **million of retails (wsb) buy the Januray 29, 2021 60C weekly on Monday, this will create an infinite gamma squeeze because MM still can't properly hedge, and are forced to buy shares at whatever price to hedge. MM doing so, forces brokers to margin call the shorts caught in their infinite short squeeze. Both conditions are pro-cyclical and feed on each other in an infinite feedback loop** ***so long as more an more retails buy the GME 60C.***

There is a chance that MM can dump the shares they bought to hedged the gamma steepening and call buying \[1\]. However, doing so does not make them market neutral. It effectively turns MM into a hedge fund. SEC may allow them to get away from this momentarily.

**However, after the MM dump shares in an attempt to stop the infinite gamma squeeze they will be net short GME shares and unhedged/not market neutral.** If after the MM dump, retails continue to buy GME shares up to the $60 price, MM will be caught in a *exponentially worse gamma squeeze*, which should GME go pass 60C (gamma bump) on the week of January 25, it would turn into the one of biggest tail risk event for the MM/Citidal.

**tldr;**

**There is a gap in the market structure so that if millions of retails buy Januray 29 GME 60C on January 25 2021, there is a high probability of both an infinite gamma and short squeeze. This has never happened in financial history. And should millions of retail buy the January 29 GME60C 2021, the losses for MM but profits for retail will be massive. Retails could see 100000% return on their weekly GME Januray 29 call options at the highest strike price.**

**Edit1:** Apparently there may be higher call prices for the January 29 2021 option chains. Fundamentally, this analysis is still correct. Should millions of retail all choose a common higher call strike price to buy (higher than 60C), the gamma squeeze will be triggered when that prices is hit.

Example:

Should millions of retail buy the January 29 70C or January 29 75C, and the infinite short squeeze continues. If the GME 70C or 75C is hit, GME share price enters a gamma squeeze.

What the MM are hoping for are twofolds:

1. They scare retails to sell below $60. This alleviates the infinite gamma squeeze. Or;
2. Retails don't all buy the same call options. But given that wsb loves high risk, I hypothesize they will all choose the furthest OTM call options.

GME at 60 is the Maginot line next week. Should it go to 75, gamma and infinite short squeeze continues. Should it fall below it, MM have won a strategic victory.

**Edit2:**

For gamma squeeze, you look at the open interest (OI) and strike price. Should the share price get close to the price with a highest open interest, that's when the gamma steepening occurs as probability goes to 1. MM have to buy shares to remain neutral as the options are now ITM.

Since it's always under performing there is simply better investments to be made on stocks that doesnt shit themselves so much. 

The realization that nobody gives 2 fucks about 5g. 

Nokia gets pumped on wsb before every earnings, many people got burned. 

Wiser choice would be to go with alternatives, Samsung, erricson, whatever the fuck USA has, heck if Huawei makes comeback which they are planning to do, i cant imagine nokia is anything but where dreams go die.

Two things that stood out to me that would seriously help reduce the float. 

The first is their strategy about increasing free cash flow. It’s working even in the tough few quarters caused by COVID. If they have more free cash flow, they can increase dividends (good for boomer interest and great for float if everyone sets it to DRIP). 

The second is the fact that the freaking Finnish government is buying the stock after explicitly saying they wouldn’t a while back.

3159,AI,"NNOX is interesting. They are a medical imaging company with a vision of “preventative healthcare through early detection”. The OTM calls (I haven’t verified them, but I’ll take your word on that) is probably due to a “Second Opinion” AI they demonstrated in a virtual radiology conference on Jan 6th, 2021. (I couldn’t find a link to the actual demo, but the other company demos are [here.](https://www.nanox.vision)) 

They have some interesting tech. Their electron source is not filament-based (normal ones use a heavy metal filament, such as tantalum, and run a current through it like a lightbulb, then they slam those electrons into an x-ray emitting material using magnets. Filaments like those generate a lot of free electrons randomly, so the x-rays generated can’t easily be controlled. Control≈resolution.) They claim the nanotechnology electron source is digital, allowing them more control over the electrons generated. In the demo, they used less power to generate the image, so that might be true.

Their 3-D imaging device looks cool. High res images they can shuffle through layers to see different things. In that demo, they said they don’t have approval for the 3-D imaging device they created, but from what I understand device approval is easier to get when there are similar devices, so that may not be a huge obstacle. (Tons of imaging devices out there.)

I’m guessing there will be a short bull run as news of it picks up and gets translated into mainstream media. However, since they are in the medical research field and haven’t/won’t post a profit for some time, don’t expect it to go to the moon in the short term. Good long term bet tho.

I’m not an expert, this is not advice, I’m just an internet autist with a physics degree I don’t use. Please don’t sue me for my Wendy’s paycheck if you lose all your tendies, I don’t have enough to share. That being said, I might pick some shares up for the long haul to the moon in 2-5 years. The bull run is too iffy in the short run for me and I don’t know shit about fuck when it comes to options. Anyone got an emoji for a slow-ass rocket?✈️✈️✈️✈️✈️✈️✈️?

3275,GME,"You'll get margin called if your account value falls under a specific number. This number is 

(amount you borrowed)/(1 - maintenance requirement).

Maintenance requirement is set by the broker and can vary from stock to stock. Usually it's like 25~50%.

So say you borrow $10k and GME is pretty volatile, so maintenance req is 45%. This means you have to keep your account value above (10,000)/(1 - 0.45) = $18,181. 

If your account dips under this number, you will get a notice from your broker that goes ""hey we need you to deposit cash into your account to bring it back up to the maintenance req"", and if you can't do that, you are forced to sell off shares to reduce the size of the loan. Bringing your account back up to maintenance is called ""covering"" which is a word you'll see a lot.

An assumption I'm making here is that someone who is yoloing 300 shares on margin is probably not very liquid. They probably don't have $100k sitting around to patch up their margin account if the stock price gets pushed down. On the short side, a hedge fund will have millions and millions sitting around to spend on maintenance, and portfolio managers can just keep pulling money until their boss stomps into their office and goes ""okay what the fuck are you doing"". So having margin buyers on the long side is very likely to be a net negative for us, it will pressure the price down harder than it will push the price up against the shorts.",0.046,0.878,0.076,0.5106

With that said they have benefited from natural gas prices being high. They don’t refine as much as suncor however, but with low oil prices it’s actually a good thing as they don’t spend as much refining. There recently has been 3 deaths at suncor since Christmas on 2 separate occasions on top of the law suit. If a person wants to be exposed to Canadian oil and gas there is only 2 real players.
