I have $100k liquid that finally freed up from some ARKK options Friday, and I'm considering doing my part with GME; better late than never, I hope.  I'm thinking of buying about $66k worth of shares at open and then buying to open about $33k worth of 4/16 $115c.  Is this a fools move?  If you had $100k, what would you do?  I AM NOT ASKING WHAT I SHOULD DO WITH MY $100K (NFA).

I figure so long as the short float % of interest continues to be over 100%, then there's still juice to be squeezed to move the share price up (I.e. the squeeze hasn't yet squozen).  Is this an incorrect understanding of these short squeezes?

I just want this to work out, but I also think I may do a Reddit raffler if this works out.  If I can get into the 7 figure club by 4/16, I'm thinking of maybe doing a Reddit raffler for 100x $100 Gamestop gift cards.  Is that OK or a violation of WSB TOS?

The valuation of futures, stocks and options may fluctuate, and, as a result, clients may lose more than their original investment. The impact of seasonal and geopolitical events is already factored into market prices. The highly leveraged nature of futures trading means that small market movements will have a great impact on your trading account and this can work against you, leading to large losses or can work for you, leading to large gains. If the market moves against you, you may sustain a total loss greater than the amount you deposited into your account. You are responsible for all the risks and financial resources you use and for the chosen trading system. You should not engage in trading unless you fully understand the nature of the transactions you are entering into and the extent of your exposure to loss.

I have $100k liquid that finally freed up from some ARKK options Friday, and I'm considering doing my part with GME; better late than never, I hope.  I'm thinking of buying about $66k worth of shares at open and then buying to open about $33k worth of 4/16 $115c.  Is this a fools move?  If you had $100k, what would you do?  I AM NOT ASKING WHAT I SHOULD DO WITH MY $100K (NFA).

I figure so long as the short float % of interest continues to be over 100%, then there's still juice to be squeezed to move the share price up (I.e. the squeeze hasn't yet squozen).  Is this an incorrect understanding of these short squeezes?

I just want this to work out, but I also think I may do a Reddit raffler if this works out.

183,ALLY,"I think anyone who YOLOs 100% of their planned GME funds into a weekly 115c is fucking purebred WSB retard, but that doesn't mean they have no place in a trade.  

I'm thinking of buying around $60 and then selling slightly OTM covered calls (think 70-75c's) and using the premiums to buy a disproportionate amount of further OTM calls (think 85-90c's), a couple of OTM puts or two to hedge against a retrace (think 30-45p's), and grabbing a bunch (10:1 VS CC sale) of lotto tickets (100-115c's) with anything left over.  

Would give you strong resilience in a deep crash, no net change in gains up to 70-75 (so +16%-+25% locked in), leveraged gains returning later and breaking even with not selling the CC's around $90-$95, leveraged gains near the option top-end, and SUPREMELY leveraged gains in the event of a squeeze (gamma/otherwise).  

You will lose out if the price goes down to like $45 (though no more than shares would lose out), and you will lose out _potential gains_ compared to shares alone if the price ends around $85 (though you'd still have locked in solid gains of 17%-25%), but in exchange it gives you a host of lotto tickets and security on both ends.  

IMO, this lets us act like shares for the MOST likely scenarios (-10% through +10%), covers our risk in the event of a catastrophe, doesn't cap our gains if it repeats the last few weeks ($95+), leverages us if it moons ($100-$115), and LOTTERIES us if it REALLY moons ($150+)  

[Something like this.](https://optioncreator.com/st86rq8)  

Actual numbers:  

You start _gaining_ money if it crashes below $10.  
You only lose 50% as much due to crashing if it reaches $25.  
You are basically net-neutral (_slightly_ positive) against pure shares from $35-$72  
You miss out on potential gains from $72-$108 (i.e., you lock in 20% gains instead of up to 50% gains).  
You fucking skyrocket beyond $115 (we're talking a $1200 (base 20%) gain for every $1 the price moves).  

EDIT: Final note, if the deep OTM shit is as SUPER pricy as people have been expecting, it'd be worth it to just write some 115c's on day one to cash into the MAD FUCKING PREMIUM and then buy them back later in the week after IV crush. In the scenario where the shares absolutely fucking moon, you are still locking in basically 100% fucking gains and you can't complain about that.  

Depending on your optimism (/level of retardation) you could really commit to the cause and do something like selling EXTREMELY valuable 100c's (if the premiums are as high as everyone is speculating due to the recent gamma squeeze) and cover (either immediately or after 2 days of massive IV crush) with 115c's at a lower premium.

187,VS,"I think anyone who YOLOs 100% of their planned GME funds into a weekly 115c is fucking purebred WSB retard, but that doesn't mean they have no place in a trade.  

I'm thinking of buying around $60 and then selling slightly OTM covered calls (think 70-75c's) and using the premiums to buy a disproportionate amount of further OTM calls (think 85-90c's), a couple of OTM puts or two to hedge against a retrace (think 30-45p's), and grabbing a bunch (10:1 VS CC sale) of lotto tickets (100-115c's) with anything left over.  

Would give you strong resilience in a deep crash, no net change in gains up to 70-75 (so +16%-+25% locked in), leveraged gains returning later and breaking even with not selling the CC's around $90-$95, leveraged gains near the option top-end, and SUPREMELY leveraged gains in the event of a squeeze (gamma/otherwise).  

You will lose out if the price goes down to like $45 (though no more than shares would lose out), and you will lose out _potential gains_ compared to shares alone if the price ends around $85 (though you'd still have locked in solid gains of 17%-25%), but in exchange it gives you a host of lotto tickets and security on both ends.  

IMO, this lets us act like shares for the MOST likely scenarios (-10% through +10%), covers our risk in the event of a catastrophe, doesn't cap our gains if it repeats the last few weeks ($95+), leverages us if it moons ($100-$115), and LOTTERIES us if it REALLY moons ($150+)  

[Something like this.](https://optioncreator.com/st86rq8)  

Actual numbers:  

You start _gaining_ money if it crashes below $10.  
You only lose 50% as much due to crashing if it reaches $25.  
You are basically net-neutral (_slightly_ positive) against pure shares from $35-$72  
You miss out on potential gains from $72-$108 (i.e., you lock in 20% gains instead of up to 50% gains).  
You fucking skyrocket beyond $115 (we're talking a $1200 (base 20%) gain for every $1 the price moves).  

EDIT: Final note, if the deep OTM shit is as SUPER pricy as people have been expecting, it'd be worth it to just write some 115c's on day one to cash into the MAD FUCKING PREMIUM and then buy them back later in the week after IV crush. In the scenario where the shares absolutely fucking moon, you are still locking in basically 100% fucking gains and you can't complain about that.  

Depending on your optimism (/level of retardation) you could really commit to the cause and do something like selling EXTREMELY valuable 100c's (if the premiums are as high as everyone is speculating due to the recent gamma squeeze) and cover (either immediately or after 2 days of massive IV crush) with 115c's at a lower premium.

I have $100k liquid that finally freed up from some ARKK options Friday, and I'm considering doing my part with GME; better late than never, I hope.  I'm thinking of buying about $66k worth of shares at open and then buying to open about $33k worth of 4/16 $115c.  Is this a fools move?  If you had $100k, what would you do?  I AM NOT ASKING WHAT I SHOULD DO WITH MY $100K (NFA).

I figure so long as the short float % of interest continues to be over 100%, then there's still juice to be squeezed to move the share price up (I.e. the squeeze hasn't yet squozen).  Is this an incorrect understanding of these short squeezes?

I just want this to work out, but I also think I may do a Reddit raffler if this works out.  If I can get into the 7 figure club by 4/16, I'm thinking of maybe doing a Reddit raffler for 100x $100 Gamestop gift cards.  Is that OK or a violation of WSB TOS?

Anything written about Gamestop these days intentionally leave out this mid to long-term revamping of their entire business model and only focuses on the quarterly losses, and lack of faith in selling gaming PCs/collectibles. There is no article of substance out there that really understands the social aspect of Gamestop’s potential, the sense of community that ALREADY exists in the gaming community, the appreciation for games as ART and the creators of games as geniuses (i.e. Tim Schafer, Will Wright, John Carmack, etc,) and the overall sentiment anyone under 45-50 feel for video games. We saw what happened with Blockbuster, and to an extent, I believe the support surrounding Gamestop now is that a lot of us still believe in the magic of video games, and want to save not only the nostalgia of our youth, but a brand that defines what kind of generation we are. We’re all rooting for Ryan Cohen and company to make Gamestop the place we visit and feel all fuzzy inside again, like FUNCOLAND as kids.

The valuation of futures, stocks and options may fluctuate, and, as a result, clients may lose more than their original investment. The impact of seasonal and geopolitical events is already factored into market prices. The highly leveraged nature of futures trading means that small market movements will have a great impact on your trading account and this can work against you, leading to large losses or can work for you, leading to large gains. If the market moves against you, you may sustain a total loss greater than the amount you deposited into your account. You are responsible for all the risks and financial resources you use and for the chosen trading system.

620,GME,"I don’t see buying anything from GME as stock manipulation.  It’s real revenue they’ll report in their earnings that will be subject to review and audit.  Securities law provides public companies have to discuss their earnings in md&a, including things like trends, seasonality, etc.  If they all of a sudden had a huge of influx of revenue from for example gift card money and they believed it was attributable to what was going on, and not a real reflection or future earning power, they should mention that in md&a. But the act of giving GME $5 is not the kind of manipulation reguators would normally be concerned with. This is my personal view, but I see activist shorting as much more problematic in terms of manipulation than buying product from a company you want to support.  Not sure a regulator could ever differentiate motivations either. I see your post talks about ethics and you are entitled to your view on ethics. I would disagree though.

631,GME,"I appreciate your reply. I did not intend to suggest it is right to manipulate earnings which may have been read into my comment. I think the difference between us might be you see a deceptive intent in all calls to support GMEs business and I do not.  Revenue does more for more a company than just make earnings reports look better, it helps pay employees and pay debt to continue as a going concern.  Sure, it may also give others confidence.  Does that make it manipulative? 

None of us can buy primary equity to support the business, or lend it money, so this is one way to support it. A shareholder putting more money into a struggling business in the hope of keeping it going could potentially give a distorted view of future earning power,  but it’s not unethical  if done with the intention of helping the business succeed.  All shareholders get to read the financial statements and make up their own minds on the value of future earnings, in the context of all available public information and the issuers commentary and context. 

Maybe a deceptive intent of the type you allege exists or is being called for, maybe not. You clearly believe that with GME, the line into manipulation has been crossed, and I’m sure you feel you have your evidence for that. I don’t believe that, and so I don’t view it as unethical. I also think that’s a hard case to make given the disparate nature of this sub.  

Let me also say, market manipulation is unethical, long or short, full stop.  Your comments on my ethics or the ethics of buying products from GME should be viewed in the light of my comment above.

Reddit could very well shut down this subreddit if it got enough heat from the SEC. In terms of the legal merits, if Reddit were to push back against the SEC, IMO Reddit would have no problem pushing back. There is not a single fraud rule that applies to what is currently happening on WSB - there is no fraudulent information deliberately being dispersed, insider trading, NO part within the whole gamut of fraud. OTOH, the SEC frequently issues advisories that could create new precedent that would apply to social media and the things we see on WSB. Seems like a stretch to me though. But Reddit pushing against the SEC also seems like a stretch in the event that the two did come to a head. On a more practical level, the SEC would probably say fuck all and leave because everyone on this Reddit would just migrate elsewhere. They would have to create a whole new body of law to regulate what's going on here.

This helps me as this past month, I’ve tripled my retirement account, but I’m still depressed for not being in more or being in longer before expiration.

The only way to get your hands on shares to short was if you were a hedgefund calling directly the big funds holding shares in their ETFs etc.

But the media is pushing the narrative that this is all WSB, which is basically fucking impossible.... It's not WSB that has zeroed in on this stock and believe in it, it's the entire country.

And even if it was WSB, WSB is just an internet forum where individuals discuss stocks and share memes. There's no organization. There's no leadership. WSB is just ""investors."" So not only is the media misrepresenting who's buying this stock, but they're also misrepresenting what WSB actually is to make it sound like a nefarious organization, which is obviously ridiculous.",0.053,0.907,0.041,-0.2372

A lot of you might be too young to remember the historical ""those who don't learn from the past"" situations, but over-leveraging and getting too greedy is what caused the housing crisis 13 years ago when these autists started leveraging their portfolios thirty-five-to-fucking-one.

The S&L scandal/crisis, etc.

I'm a free market capitalist.  I really am.  But Wall Street and financial types have proven time and again that, without really strict regulation, there are 3 things that can be counted on:  1, they'll always go full retard. 2, they'll blame ""the little guy"" for why their attempt at going full retard blew up in their faces.  And 3, they'll ask the government to make them whole with the little guy's money because the financial type went full retard.

Those very late night hours occasionally lead me to discussion servers or apps, you know the common ones- I constantly hear kids with no regular income, I.e. a job, no emotional relationships, staying up all night at mom & dads house and bragging about becoming millionaires . Please understand I’m fine with all of those choices & actions I listed- I just know that it’s becoming easier & easier to sit out of life and consistently put off doing anything memorable when your in that mode. I lost my best friend to cancer in his 30’s and he said to me he regretted not going on the trip to Italy I invited him on, I never heard him saying he wished he had more online friends from all over the world.

Now match that with what the media is reporting and how their wheels are spinning overtime, spinning one narrative after the other to downplay the shady dealings of the MM and highlight retail investors as the problem creators.

922,GME,"That's what I did, have GME waiting to go for tomorrow morning and I'm just kind of browsing around now, even looking at things that aren't even the hot topic here. I have no real clue what I'm doing but I am only investing a couple hundred and I'm setting a goal to never ever invest any more of my own cash. I will only continue investing with earnings and I will only do that after recouping or doubling my initial investment. I don't play the wild games some of the riskier people here do, especially since I was lurking a few years back (or maybe it was less than that) when someone lost like $150k in 24 hours.

On that note if GME actually spiked to something ridiculous like 1k+ per share in the next few weeks I'm going to sell 90% of my stock immediately and not gamble on it going higher than that. I still have my doubts it's going to rise that much since it's all speculation around here anyways and nobody actually knows anything. This is really not much different than gambling at a casino, just slightly better odds since you have data to work from in the form of market trends.

At worst I'll be out $200, at best I'll make some nice profits in the coming weeks. Not too bad a gamble. I could invest 2k+ in gme and potentially make 30k+ but that's a huge risk and turning $150 into $2400 is the same chance but much less of a risk and I'm making more money than I had before in both cases. Although saying that now makes me want to invest a bit more if there's actually a high chance of a big payout. If it's looking good I might turn my 200 investment into a 500 investment but it all rests on what things actually look like when I wake up in the morning.",0.083,0.785,0.131,0.9583

The one benefit I see to universities right now is that they give people who aren’t necessarily go-getters a plan for how to enter into a career. Trade schools could also do this, even for things like software engineering. The closest thing right now is coding boot camps but those typically aim for a year or less time investment, which isn’t enough.

A degree should take 2 years and learn the same thing.

Or if you want to go aggro retard type in '.BB210129C15' in the symbol box of the Active Trader tool to see the bid/ask ladder and chart for the 21 Jan 19 15 Calls, for instance. This would work better on fast moving options, particulary if the 'YOLO mode' auto send box is ticked (no confirmation, just buys if your limit order matches).

I would test out the Active Trader before using it live with the 'OnDemand' historical simulator so you don't shoot your foot off.

I don't have a BB position or any opinion on whether the example option above is a good bet or not.

That means everyone else gets proportionally more of the inheritance (e.g. the son who hated his dad says he doesn't want to inherit means more for his siblings).

If the deceased had debt that means all who renounce inheritance won't inherit debt and everyone else will have proportionally more of that, too. I'm not sure about the ""line of succession"" for inheritance in that case, but if enough people renounce the inheritance then everything goes to the state. Lawmakers being lawmakers the state will get all assets but not pay any of the debt.

You guessed it: QNX + IVY = 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

The QNX Neutrino RTOS and their hypervisor will allow the consolidation of all critical (eg. steering, braking) and non-critical (eg. infotainment) systems in vehicles (or any other IoT device) to what is essentially a single hardware package.  If any of you retards heard of virtualization you will recall why a micro-kernel hypervisor is important especially in critical systems (duh, system isolation and fault tolerance).

Here's an overview of QNX and why it's different from Linux and Android (Android runs on a modified Linux kernel):  [https://imgur.com/a/7vRWoZs](https://imgur.com/a/7vRWoZs)

This is where IVY comes in. IVY will be gathering readings from QNX powered vehicles and securely processing this data in **real-time**. Most importantly **IVY is both AWS and QNS agnostic** \- this means any car manufacturer will be able to use IVY even if they don't want to use AWS on the backend or QNX in their vehicles. QNX touches every critical system of a vehicle (braking, traction, velocity, acceleration, proximity, temperature, engine). Their machine learning efforts will allow them to detect things such as: road condition anomalies (eg. ice, potholes, construction) giving cities the ability to react in real-time to deploy autonomous de-icers, construction crews; detection of large scale issues affecting vehicle fleets (eg. airbag defects, engine issues, fuel / battery innefficiencies). Think about how painful / inefficient it is for car manufacturers to detect airbag issues right now. IVY's value increases exponentially as not only vehicles but the city infrastructure becomes more connected. As discussed at the [JP Morgan's 19th Annual Tech/Auto Forum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_rYmUOcsvQ), IVY will be a AWS and QNS agnostic ""middleware"" that any car manufacturer can integrate into their existing system and start collecting and acting on that data. If you wanna connect your raspberry pi RC dildo to IVY you'll just need to `npm install ivy` and add an api key 💥

BlackBerry's latest moves puts them in a really good position. They already have a strong cybersecurity foundation and IVY is basically beginning of IoT big data (think `avg # of sensors in a vehicle * sensor polling frequency * # of vehicles`). Think of how much tendies is in the data alone. Think of how much tendies is in securing this data.

Some of you are questioning the heavy boomer talent that BB is employing but I'd like to remind you that they can tap into the minds of some of the brightest software engineering students at the University of Waterloo. Every year it produces several zucks, torvalds and ritchies. There is incredible talent here and BB is in a position to make big plays.

\- BB sold and ejected their hardware division, one of the anchors that held their business back.

\- Developed QNX, which is becoming a favorite real-time operating system for self-driving cars. QNX has the reaction speed and accuracy to satisfy many safety and insurance underwriting tests. It's also secure, as BB is still a king in cybersecurity.

\- QNX is attractive to auto-makers outside of Tesla (who uses a Linux-based kernel) who want to enter the self-driving market but don't want to develop their own system. Sony,  XPENG, and Nvidia (which means NIO, who will use Nvidia) have confirmed partnerships with BB to use QNX.

\- Self-driving cars with RTOS means cybersecurity becomes a concern. BB has a proven track record with making attack resistant software. BB also already is certified with the US Government and governments around the world, making it easier to implement then other competing systems.

\- BB also has developed IVY, a system that is 50/50 owned in partnership with Amazon, using AWS as a backbone. From what my pea-brain understands, IVY captures data in real-time to manufacturers, insurance underwriters, and government bodies about the conditions the cars with QNX go through and their performance. As an insurance guy, IVY could revolutionize the auto-insurance industry. IVY will also be a profit centre, as it'll be subscription based, very attractive for investors.

Already have some shares in BB I bought awhile ago. Don't really have the cash to sink in to more shares - Should I buy call options?

For every term you see and don't fully understand, read the investopedia page. Don't just blindly believe the retards here, you need to educate yourself from real sources. I think it helps to conceptualize options contracts as a type of insurance policy, paying a smaller amount now (premium) for the right to buy (call) or sell (put) 100 shares of the underlying stock at a specific price (strike) on any day from now until the expiry date. Higher strikes and shorter-dated expiries are cheaper, because it's more unlikely the stock price will move fast/far enough to make exercising the contract profitable -- but if the price DOES move and it becomes profitable then you can sell them for considerable tendies, at a much larger payoff than if you had just spent the same amount to buy the underlying stock. I bought my 28C's when PLTR was at like $20 (and a move to $28 within 4 months seemed unlikely), so now that they're in-the-money (ITM) they have tripled in value. But they can also lose all their value if the stock moves the wrong way. It's a riskier and more leveraged way to bet on the stock price movement.

To have access to options trading on your brokerage, you may have to ""request options trading"" permissions on your account. Usually some kind of quick form to fill out where you say ""yes I am 99 years old and I have been trading options for 99 years and I am super smart and totally not a retard"" and they autoapprove you. I use fidelity, just google for the process with TD.

And once you've learned the basics, start playing around with optionsprofitcalculator.com to visualize how the value of an options contract changes based on the underlying stock's price, time until expiry, and implied volatility (IV). Then you'll be ready to buy your first lottery ticket!",0.037,0.835,0.128,0.9829

______________________________________________________

I don't personally mess with conditional orders or multi-leg options strategies because I'd rather fly by the seat of my pants and just place one-way bets, I enjoy staying on top of the news and all that.   
I'm not thetagang relying on options for a large portion of my expected returns to need steady small profits, I just buy calls (and rarely puts) adding up to only around 10% of my total account size and exit them when I feel like momentum is stopped, I don't have hard rules for capping gains or limiting losses. I've had positions that went down to like -60% and eventually exploded and ended up as doubles or triples, options are just more volatile like that and I prefer to let it play out unless a news item really changes my original thesis.     
Almost never expiries under a month, and I do have a few LEAPs (expiries >1 year) in my non-retirement account to try to get to the long-term capital gains tax rate.  
The rest is in my Roth so it's tax-sheltered (but also can't deduct the losses if you end up with a net loss).

Remember that the price of an option you see is 1/100th of the contract (since a contract applies to x100 shares), so if you see an option at $2.00 that means you'd be buying contracts in increments of $200.  
There are plenty of contracts on any company not currently super-volatile that are like 1 or 200 each if it's OTM or near-dated enough, and the really unlikely ones are sometimes under $100. So you can make small unlikely bets on a bunch of different companies for just a few hundred, and stay on top of each of their daily news and charts and it's fun to track for months on end.

GME I'm not sure about recommending options at this point, the IV is so high from the recent insane price movement that premiums are extremely high, you'll see how that makes them harder to get profitable using the optionsprofitcalculator site (you can manually change IV if you expand the ""manual entry options"" link). TSLA has been the same for months, thetagang is leeching anyone buying one-leg options.  
Also with GME last Friday the stock broke the highest strike price available for calls, so you'd have to see what the new higher strikes are on Monday and how cheap the furthest OTM strike is. I think lots of people are going to continue chasing this up and even those new highest strikes will be in high demand -> high premiums.

PLTR I do believe this is still a very reasonable price point to get in shares, given that they have the first product demo day this Tues 1/26 and Q4 earnings will be in early Feb. And they're announcing new sticky govt contracts constantly now so there will be a steady stream of good news. I plan to hold PLTR shares for several years, I believe in their product and growth plans. (GME personally I'm not trying to hold shares, I just want to ride along with the RC turnaround story with calls in the short-term).   
PLTR IV is still on the high end (in the low 100's) with the recent jump so options premiums are relatively expensive, but still not nearly as bad as GME/TSLA since it's been kinda sideways in the 20s and low 30s for weeks, there are still much higher strikes that have never been near ITM.",0.044,0.885,0.07,0.8714

The rest is in my Roth so it's tax-sheltered (but also can't deduct the losses if you end up with a net loss).

Remember that the price of an option you see is 1/100th of the contract (since a contract applies to x100 shares), so if you see an option at $2.00 that means you'd be buying contracts in increments of $200.  
There are plenty of contracts on any company not currently super-volatile that are like 1 or 200 each if it's OTM or near-dated enough, and the really unlikely ones are sometimes under $100. So you can make small unlikely bets on a bunch of different companies for just a few hundred, and stay on top of each of their daily news and charts and it's fun to track for months on end.

GME I'm not sure about recommending options at this point, the IV is so high from the recent insane price movement that premiums are extremely high, you'll see how that makes them harder to get profitable using the optionsprofitcalculator site (you can manually change IV if you expand the ""manual entry options"" link). TSLA has been the same for months, thetagang is leeching anyone buying one-leg options.  
Also with GME last Friday the stock broke the highest strike price available for calls, so you'd have to see what the new higher strikes are on Monday and how cheap the furthest OTM strike is. I think lots of people are going to continue chasing this up and even those new highest strikes will be in high demand -> high premiums.

PLTR I do believe this is still a very reasonable price point to get in shares, given that they have the first product demo day this Tues 1/26 and Q4 earnings will be in early Feb. And they're announcing new sticky govt contracts constantly now so there will be a steady stream of good news. I plan to hold PLTR shares for several years, I believe in their product and growth plans. (GME personally I'm not trying to hold shares, I just want to ride along with the RC turnaround story with calls in the short-term).   
PLTR IV is still on the high end (in the low 100's) with the recent jump so options premiums are relatively expensive, but still not nearly as bad as GME/TSLA since it's been kinda sideways in the 20s and low 30s for weeks, there are still much higher strikes that have never been near ITM.",0.044,0.885,0.07,0.8714

1487,CEO,"So initially there was a changing sentiment over the company’s future, but that’s kind of a separate story than what’s going on at the moment (afterwards things will return back to this though, whether this side of the story is true or not you’ll see play out over the next few years). Right now, and why people are happy buying at any level/thinking they’ll see a ridiculously high and quick return is because of a speculated short squeeze. 

Why do people think a short squeeze is on the horizon? Because the shorters have been far too over confident in their plays to the point that they’ve created a pretty dangerous situation for themselves. That being that far too many naked short positions have been created on the stock, to the point that they have been running out of shares to borrow to create new positions (so they can’t force the SP down either to try get themselves out of this predicament). So as soon as they’re called upon to close their positions they’ll be forced to buy whatever they can on market. And this is where the other side comes in with everyone telling each other to sell at a much higher price. Since for as long as there is still a shorter that needs to close their position but has yet to do so, they’ll need to buy whatever is available to them. So if no one is willing to sell their shares but only at $100’s above current price then bad luck but the shorters will need to pay. After that point it will inevitably fall right back down, as legitimate investors (those that are long on the stock) aren’t going to buy at crazy high levels, maybe some traders might but fuck that would be risky as hell. Although you probably will see some mom & pop retail investors get burnt if they get FOMO and aren’t aware of what’s actually going on.

So as things currently stand, there’s no legal basis to regulate WSB. But what worries me is, these same fat cats who are now pissed off and weaving false narratives will create political pressure for greater regulation of retail investors—say, taking away options trading unless you have a certain account minimum or something—likely on the grounds of “investor protection.” This is the same outdated, bullshit rationale for the PDT Rule and the Accredited Investor Rule (which keeps most of us from buying into privately-held companies pre-IPO).

The recent interview with Larry Summers on Boomerberg saw him strongly implying that Congress and the SEC should seek stricter regulation of retail in order to “protect retail investors from themselves” and “protect the integrity of the market structure.” Ominous.

And I hate to put a political layer on this, but I think it bears noting: since Establishment Dems now control the political branches in DC, if they choose to regulate in the direction Summers (himself an Establishment Dem) strongly implied in his interview, most established media outlets will go all-in on pushing and selling that course of action to the public at large.

**Short term (coming week):**

* I agree with the gamma squeeze explanation (and I learnt something new!) which means Monday morning will be volatile, likely gapping up and maybe shooting up from FOMO (maybe between $80~$100, or higher)

* We top out between 9:45~10 am then it heads downwards. I expect a ton of retailers to sell and cash out (including a couple of whales) which should bring downward pressure.

* We go back down to $40~$50 (can be wrong about this range) before buyers come in again. This time though, we should expect bigger players coming in as well as short-covering.

**Medium term (after next week):**

* We'll stay around that range till earnings or some other announcement from RC (for ex: increasing his stake in the company). Remember, long-term thesis is for a turn-around but that hasn't happened yet. We're putting money on expectation and hyping that. Most retailers don't have the patience to wait for that either as much as they say they will hold till $1000.

* Doesn't make sense for RC to increase his stake at current prices unless he's already done it and it hasn't been announced yet. I'm sure he will at some point.

* I don't think we'll see short-covering at current levels because this price movement is not sustainable and they know that. When you've got shorts holding onto TSLA after losing $38B in 2020, GME is pocket change. They can afford to wait a couple of weeks.

* I do think the price movement caught them off-guard enough to revisit the short-thesis and they will cover instead of doubling down on the short-bets.

> Looking at the above, it is clear that heading into October of 2008, around 55% of VW shares were already unavailable in the market for any realistic purposes.  As a result, when Porsche increased its stake by an additional 44%, it meant that the true available float went down from 45% of outstanding shares to around just 1% of outstanding shares.

1828,UI,"I work in embedded software, specifically writing linux kernel drivers and doing a process called Board Bringup. That is, take new custom boards and SoCs and get it up and running.

Linux can and does run as an RTOS. See RT-Linux.

But while linux is great, and runs on everything from toasters to supercomputers - it's not something you put in a car. Critical real time software, needs to be developed and certified in a very conservative way - and the linux kernel development process is moving at a breakneck speed, and the internal structures and APIs change all the time (not the interfaces, but the internal source level) - which breaks vendors code who do not submit drivers upstream. That's basically a large majority of all the custom gizmo manufacturers out there. And it breaks hard and often.

No one want's that shit in a car, rocket, train, etc. 

That's where QNX comes in - it's not flashy, but it's a safe software base to build products off that can be put into a car.

And also, QNX is just a kernel - like linux, and QNX does infact already have ports for all the important UI code, like Qt. You can take any software that compiles on linux, and compile it for QNX with few, if any modifications required. It's POSIX after all.

I don't think you understand just how important trusted, tested, and proven software like QNX is for critical systems. This isn't a webpage, where some 25 year old javascript retards, who barely knows how to zip down their pants before taking a piss, can just bruteforce their way to get a barely functioning product shipped - and fix it on the fly with 24 hotfixes per day.

This is serious stuff, and there IS legal liabilities and there IS engineers career on the line - and criminal negligence charges - waiting in the wings if they ship some POS software. They will always chose a vendor who has a proven track record - which also serves as a Cover Your Ass, should anything go wrong.

QNX is in an extremely strong position and no other embedded software is even in the same ballpark. QNX is rock solid and has a 39 year track record. QNX was used in products before Linus Torvalds balls dropped.",0.097,0.814,0.089,-0.4785

1835,BB,"First of all, thank you for your post. Quite insightful. I will respond to your bear case, with the **possible** bullish points (I'll also give the bearish take on it).

&#x200B;

> **""It's so secure!""** 

That's a sentiment around BlackBerry. Basically the stuff they do is normal stuff that doesn't evolve quick - but it is secure.  
\*BBMe - Just messaging, but secure  
\*BlackBerry AtHoc - Just crisis communication, but secure & reliable  
\*BlackBerry Workspaces - Just file sharing, but secure  
\*...

They're looking to advance this sentiment to cars, since in their eyes cars will be the next big connected thing. Especially in self-driving security is key. 

Also they are already running on 175mil cars, one would think they've already had atleast *some* attacks. (In 2017 there were about 100mil Mac computers, and they've suffered some attacks)

*Bullish: They make it secure and get famous for it*  
*Bearish: They make it secure, but others succeed as well / They fail at making/keeping it secure*

&#x200B;

> **""But QNX has a moat! Look at all these safety standards.""** 

It can't hurt to have these certifications. 

*Bullish: Manufacturers care about certifications*  
*Bearish: Manufacturers don't care about certifications*

&#x200B;

> **""Look at the 175 million vehicles using QNX!""** 

It sure doesn't hurt to already have relationships. They have relationships with a lot of top tier manufacturers.

src: [https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/blackberry-qnx-software-now-embedded-in-more-than-175-million-vehicles-301081594.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/blackberry-qnx-software-now-embedded-in-more-than-175-million-vehicles-301081594.html)

The articles also states ""In the past five years we've gone from BlackBerry QNX technology helping to power 60 million cars to today's announcement of more than 175 million ""  
This is about 25% YoY growth. Or x3 in 5 years.

It's no guarantee that they keep growing like this however.

*Bullish: They keep growing like this, or even more with EV's coming (needing more electronics, meaning more software)*  
*Bearish: Manufacturers make their own stuff or use other system suppliers.*

&#x200B;

> **BlackBerry IVY** 

BlackBerry IVY wants to be a platform for all cars, and does not want to own the data generated by the platform. This is something important for manufacturers, and is something the Apple/Android car will probably not provide.  
The way they presented this partnership: BlackBerry knows cars, Amazon knows UI and data. 

*Bullish: Manufacturers implement IVY because they'll own their data, IVY gets a big market share which develops in something like Android/iOS for cars and then the decide to monetize since they can't be beaten at that point. This is hard however, as can be seen in the smartphone world: many have tried and many have failed.*  
*Bearish: They fail.*

&#x200B;

>**Talent** 

I know nothing about this. 

&#x200B;

> **Parting sentiment: Stay simple or get squeezed out**

Looking at the 60 -> 175mil in the past 5 years, I dont think they're on track to be squeezed out. The direction can change ofcourse.

1836,UI,"First of all, thank you for your post. Quite insightful. I will respond to your bear case, with the **possible** bullish points (I'll also give the bearish take on it).

&#x200B;

> **""It's so secure!""** 

That's a sentiment around BlackBerry. Basically the stuff they do is normal stuff that doesn't evolve quick - but it is secure.  
\*BBMe - Just messaging, but secure  
\*BlackBerry AtHoc - Just crisis communication, but secure & reliable  
\*BlackBerry Workspaces - Just file sharing, but secure  
\*...

They're looking to advance this sentiment to cars, since in their eyes cars will be the next big connected thing. Especially in self-driving security is key. 

Also they are already running on 175mil cars, one would think they've already had atleast *some* attacks. (In 2017 there were about 100mil Mac computers, and they've suffered some attacks)

*Bullish: They make it secure and get famous for it*  
*Bearish: They make it secure, but others succeed as well / They fail at making/keeping it secure*

&#x200B;

> **""But QNX has a moat! Look at all these safety standards.""** 

It can't hurt to have these certifications. 

*Bullish: Manufacturers care about certifications*  
*Bearish: Manufacturers don't care about certifications*

&#x200B;

> **""Look at the 175 million vehicles using QNX!""** 

It sure doesn't hurt to already have relationships. They have relationships with a lot of top tier manufacturers.

The articles also states ""In the past five years we've gone from BlackBerry QNX technology helping to power 60 million cars to today's announcement of more than 175 million ""  
This is about 25% YoY growth. Or x3 in 5 years.

It's no guarantee that they keep growing like this however.

*Bullish: They keep growing like this, or even more with EV's coming (needing more electronics, meaning more software)*  
*Bearish: Manufacturers make their own stuff or use other system suppliers.*

&#x200B;

> **BlackBerry IVY** 

BlackBerry IVY wants to be a platform for all cars, and does not want to own the data generated by the platform. This is something important for manufacturers, and is something the Apple/Android car will probably not provide.  
The way they presented this partnership: BlackBerry knows cars, Amazon knows UI and data. 

*Bullish: Manufacturers implement IVY because they'll own their data, IVY gets a big market share which develops in something like Android/iOS for cars and then the decide to monetize since they can't be beaten at that point. This is hard however, as can be seen in the smartphone world: many have tried and many have failed.*  
*Bearish: They fail.*

&#x200B;

>**Talent** 

I know nothing about this. 

&#x200B;

> **Parting sentiment: Stay simple or get squeezed out**

Looking at the 60 -> 175mil in the past 5 years, I dont think they're on track to be squeezed out. The direction can change ofcourse.  
Stay simple is something that may be plausible. However since I have no experience in the field I do not know how fast paced these things are and whether they need to change quick.

Do you think Amazon partnered with BB for IVY for shits and giggles? Management and control of automotive sensor data is going to be a multibillion dollar industry and ivy is poised to be a major part of it.

Their IOT business was actually shrinking prior to the cylance merger and QNX is totally tapped out until IVY comes, but the cybersecurity products were showing good growth before the cylance merger and are experiencing growing demand now according to John Chen's most recent statements regarding cybersuite.

OS development is one of the least attractive avenues for young developers. A fair amount of schools don’t have OS in their curricculum, and when they do it’s literally one of, if not the most, challenging classes they’ll take in CS. Self-taught devs aren’t learning OS either. Most young devs are learning modern web tech stacks and/or Java application dev because that’s where the jobs are (ML has also been on the rise). Now factor in that it’s an embedded system and it’s even *less* appealing. Working in C/C++ at a low level is hard, dirty work. And that’s where they thrive.

That means Google Assistant, Maps, and other automotive-approved Android apps will be available in GM’s cars via the Play Store without requiring the use of an Android smartphone.

It's all about the data. Now that AWS is involved, the collection of automotive data just got a big upgrade for real-time analysis on a vehicle. It is really cool, but be warned I'm an engineer with a masters in business analytics.

Now let's look a little into how the data and services will send BB into space. Many of the companies that have BB's system in their vehicles will have the maintenance/service shops tied into AWS. Each time a vehicle enters the shop, a report - for a fee or subscription fee - will be created with information on how the vehicle's shitty driver. The vehicle is repair and offers more precise time lines on ware-and-tear and future maintenance. Carfax or a new competitor will now be able to receive more information on used vehicles that has BB systems in them for a price. Also car insurance, no need for ""snapshot"" from Progressive. I dont know what the actual game plan or alternate plans are but AWS and BB look like they are about to show up in boots and ruin the black tie affair.

>ETAS GmbH and BlackBerry QNX, a business unit of BlackBerry Limited, will work together to develop and market a safety-critical platform for next-generation connected and autonomous vehicles.

>The two companies are joining forces to develop and market a software platform and associated tools for vehicle computers and domain controllers based on the AUTOSAR Adaptive standard. The joint solution combines BlackBerrry QNX's POSIX-compliant, security-certified real-time operating system and hypervisor with ETAS expertise around functional security and basic software based on the AUTOSAR Adaptive standard. It provides a powerful and secure foundation for the development of microprocessor-based vehicle computers and domain controllers. The solution complies with the ISO 26262:2018 standard, which allows it to be used in systems up to and including ASIL-D. The ETAS and BlackBerry QNX collaboration also aims to help customers work with the integrated solution.

Is that not to be taken seriously in your opinion, say just some light-weight cooperation on establishing standards rather than a business collaboration? I could not find any similar cooperation for e.g. Continental.",0.018,0.893,0.089,0.9179

What is interesting about NOPE is the common wisdom that option flows aren't predictive of price trends, which this is likely going to refute.

2231,GME,"I was actually more in agreement with the conclusions in your previous posts than this one. My theory: This is showing more hallmarks of Blue Apron squeeze than a short squeeze.

**Short term (coming week):**

* I agree with the gamma squeeze explanation (and I learnt something new!) which means Monday morning will be volatile, likely gapping up and maybe shooting up from FOMO (maybe between $80~$100, or higher)

* We top out between 9:45~10 am then it heads downwards. I expect a ton of retailers to sell and cash out (including a couple of whales) which should bring downward pressure.

* We go back down to $40~$50 (can be wrong about this range) before buyers come in again. This time though, we should expect bigger institutional buyers coming in as well as short-covering.

**Medium term (after next week):**

* We'll stay around that range till earnings or some other announcement from RC (for ex: increasing his stake in the company). Remember, long-term thesis is for a turnaround but that hasn't happened yet. We're putting money on expectation and hyping that. Most retailers don't have the patience to wait for that either as much as they say they will hold till $1000.

* Doesn't make sense for RC to increase his stake at current prices unless he's already done it and it hasn't been announced yet. I'm sure he will at some point.

* I don't think we'll see short-covering at current levels because this price movement is not sustainable and they know that. When you've got shorts holding onto TSLA after losing $38B in 2020, GME is pocket change. They can afford to wait a couple of weeks.

* I do think the price movement caught them off-guard enough to revisit the short-thesis and they will cover instead of doubling down on the short-bets. As I imagine, the turnaround may fail but risking the money to find out may not be worth it for many.

* If the turnaround is executed as well as we hope, I'm sure it'll cross $40B. But that will take time, patience and legit 💎👐 that most don't have.

One thing that jumps out is your point about hedge funds and their ability to influence GME in the coming days and weeks. You say that could go one way or the other, and the obvious occurs to me, which is that there are very large short interests wanting very badly to get out of their positions with the least damage.

What are the odds these two groups - current short sellers and large hedge funds not currently short - might, say, realize the existence of certain synergies in their respective situations, and might separately act in ways that when taken together, might benefit them collectively and individually.

In other words, maybe this unique run-up combined with an outsized short interest wanting out asap creates opportunity for the large hedge fund wanting to throw some money around and do some stuff here. Maybe that involves taking the price down and creating better exits for the shorts.

please please please google the greeks for options, read or watch a short video

your enemy on your calls right now is theta, they will get eaten by it as it is the time component of your contracts.

You should come up with a plan today and tomorrow of how you want to work your position, if they are 60c and GME stays above 60 they are ""in the money"" so you have the option (get it) of selling it for cash value or exercising it before or on expiration (providing you have the funds to do so) so a 60c contract would be the option to buy 100 shares at $60 each. A good thing to think through today would be what price would you be happy profiting at...the time to think about this is now, as once you see a stock rising, and rising, etc, you may not think through enough to realize you could take your profit, and then 20 minutes later the stock gets slammed to 59 and now your options are worth less. The IV is gonna be incredible on these this week, which means that everyone will be paying more for the options, makes it harder to overcome cost of contract and profit.

If you are not interested in holding shares, then just sell it when you are happy with your profit this week, but as OP is saying, its gonna be a hell of a ride, so buckle in cowboy

If you want to buy GME, you will need the cash to cover the 100 shares. If you don't have the cash, DO NOT let it expire worthless

if this is your first time with options contracts please remember this:

**Consider SELLING THEM WHEN YOU ARE UP, take the profits, then keep learning.**

if you hold them, they will go down in value if the stock doesn't continue past $60

Many people, including myself, have spent money on contracts and held them past the perfect time to sell them for max profit...that's because no one knows the future, and human nature is to think that if you are making money, there's gotta be higher stock prices right around the corner. If you are not careful they will very quickly get destroyed if the stock does not stay above your 60 strike

your enemy on your calls right now is theta, they will get eaten by it as it is the time component of your contracts.

You should come up with a plan today and tomorrow of how you want to work your position, if they are 60c and GME stays above 60 they are ""in the money"" so you have the option (get it) of selling it for cash value or exercising it before or on expiration (providing you have the funds to do so) so a 60c contract would be the option to buy 100 shares at $60 each. A good thing to think through today would be what price would you be happy profiting at...the time to think about this is now, as once you see a stock rising, and rising, etc, you may not think through enough to realize you could take your profit, and then 20 minutes later the stock gets slammed to 59 and now your options are worth less. The IV is gonna be incredible on these this week, which means that everyone will be paying more for the options, makes it harder to overcome cost of contract and profit.

If you are not interested in holding shares, then just sell it when you are happy with your profit this week, but as OP is saying, its gonna be a hell of a ride, so buckle in cowboy

If you want to buy GME, you will need the cash to cover the 100 shares. If you don't have the cash, DO NOT let it expire worthless

if this is your first time with options contracts please remember this:

**Consider SELLING THEM WHEN YOU ARE UP, take the profits, then keep learning.**

if you hold them, they will go down in value if the stock doesn't continue past $60

Many people, including myself, have spent money on contracts and held them past the perfect time to sell them for max profit...that's because no one knows the future, and human nature is to think that if you are making money, there's gotta be higher stock prices right around the corner. If you are not careful they will very quickly get destroyed if the stock does not stay above your 60 strike

Old comment from another poster who spent a while tracking him:

You're correct. Unlucky-Prize is a paid shill. Been following him for a while.

I'll just quote my past comment summarizing his behaviour (reply to his post on WSB tribalism):

""Unluck-prize is all like ""People don't pay enough attention to me and I get  downvoted, must be tribalism!"", ""WSB content is shit (shocking!) my  analysis is great, witness me!"".

Questions is why does this guy care so much and why he produces so much content on GME.

One  can come to a logical conclusion he's either an average trader with  superiority complex (which is fine) or a paid shill. His first post are  full of manipulative, fearmongering hyperbolic expressions in every  paragraph. When I called him out he adapted and changed the tone of his  messaging.

In his tribalism post  he's in essence complaining about not having enough influence over WSB  crowd. Really mate? Why would you fucking care? Do you get a bonus for a  number of upvotes or what?

If you dig deeper in his comments (just a few examples from memory) it's full of stuff like:

\-> Cohen is a founder, not a CEO - bearish

\-> Sherman is great - still bearish

\-> Uberkikz (Rod Alzmann ) and others DD posters not even amateurs, their DD sucks - bearish

\-> Institutional investors are not buying GME - bearish

\-> Price action is just a gamma squeeze - bearish

\-> Price action last week is just WSB buying- bearish

\-> there will be a MM catastrophic selling event (had little impact) - bearish

\-> MOASS is impossible - bearish

\-> shorts already covered - bearish

\-> Citron knows shorting and is legit - bearish

\-> We don't know if Melvin is really shorting - bearish

Then he claims he's net bullish. Fuck me, if that does not give paid shill vibes I don't know what does.

There are very few options:

- Interactive Brokers (IBKR Lite) - Dunno how long sign-up takes, but apparently there is a fee for market data)
- Tastyworks (their sign-up takes 5-7 business days)
- Lynx.nl (Dutch-only) which just uses IB's system, they are like a broker-reseller. (requires passing some knowledge tests and 2-years trading experience for options...)

The lynx site looks like a scam to me anyway and it's tacky af, they keep showing stats from a different broker while saying they're better but from what I've seen they're worse.

IB seems the best one imho, still debating if I should try to sign up tomorrow as I don't think it'll be approved in time anyway. I really wish DeGiro did options for NYSE, they do it for other exhanges but not the main US ones.

But I'll add to the DD by looking at it's debt and workforce. In 2019 (using the data that I have available that may be shite), the company took on 18k employees or increased it's workforce 40%.

It also took on a load of debt around the same time, now the company was profitable, not wildly so but it's a drug company and they print money faster than JPow ever could. The company has beaten analyst forecasts (which btw was 4 consecutive quarterly forecasts of negative EPS, with beats of around 100 yen)

So why would they need more debt? . The company is priming itself for expansion in it's core business, plus it has plenty of assets and as mentioned above is wisely divesting.

But I'll add to the DD by looking at it's debt and workforce. In 2019 (using the data that I have available that may be shite), the company took on 18k employees or increased it's workforce 40%.

It also took on a load of debt around the same time, now the company was profitable, not wildly so but it's a drug company and they print money faster than JPow ever could. The company has beaten analyst forecasts (which btw was 4 consecutive quarterly forecasts of negative EPS, with beats of around 100 yen)

So why would they need more debt? . The company is priming itself for expansion in it's core business, plus it has plenty of assets and as mentioned above is wisely divesting.

2540,LEAP,"I mean probably selling if it does pop, but I think you might slightly misunderstand theta.

A year LEAP has tons of theta VALUE, because there’s so much time left on it. If you look at the options you’ll notice theta is 0, meaning it’s not decaying at all for quite a while. 

I’m not sure when it’ll start kicking in but theta decay occurs as the option loses theta value, meaning there’s less time left on it meaning there isn’t as much potential value.

As the option gets closer to expiry, theta will go to -.01 and start losing a dollar in value a day at some point which is about where I’d consider getting rid of it",0.113,0.766,0.122,0.3034

2544,BB,"AWS is the driver of this deal. They already have an Alexa SDK plugin for QNX. QNX supports CarPlay and Android Auto. and has been working for years in many cars.

The rumors of Apple teaming up w/ Hyundai is stupid- South Koreans love Samsung, and Apple hates agnosticism. If they even enter the market, they will be late and alienate users. Cross them off.

Amazon is the big data company that can monetize the entire deal 100x over. They also don't have an OS, but they are getting in game right now before Apple, Microsoft and Google try and pry away at the sector. They already destroyed their competitors with Alexa.

IVY is built on QNX. Some 🌈🐻wrote an article a couple days ago saying BB is ditching QNX for IVY and that's a ""problem,"" that's wrong, IVY is an evolution, a next-gen system.

Lastly, the patent portfolio can protect BB. They can license patents for money and collect on every car sold. BB was ahead of the game with this pivot.

2595,API,">Actually, this is quite different from what QNX has been doing traditionally. So, we announced IVY, which is the intelligent vehicle everywhere. So, IVY is a cloud-connected and cross platform that is multi-OS, multi-cloud, in-car software that allows automakers to access a vehicle sensor data in compliance with safety and security requirements to process that data with updatable code to create new vehicle insights and then share those insights with developers through a consistent and simple in-car API mechanism.

...

>Right. So, it's a 50-50 joint development. And something I didn't stress enough in the last question, just to be clear, this is OS and cloud agnostic. No dependency on AWS cloud and no dependency on QNX. This is truly a generic piece of middleware to create this ecosystem. So, obviously, we're doing development on QNX. We expect QNX to be the high runner within the vehicle because of our dominant position in the car. I mean, this is part of the reason that AWS is very interested in working with us.

What they didn't figure out yet is how IVY is going to be monetized like they said in the transcript.
IVY is going to be OS agnostic, meaning your car doesn't need to run QNX to use IVY for data gathering.

That said every single stock I purchased on my own soared over 100% some is luck from buying it early in pandemic decline but some I just bought recently because I know the industry (Tech).   


Just for example:   
JETS: While it tanked 50% I knew its going to recover and its still not there, why? Well like many airlines, they still are not where they were at Feb/2019 so there is a lot of room to wiggle.   
TESLA: I thought to gamble some of the money after the split, and now I am sitting on 158.38% gain  
CRWD: I own stock for what I purchased for my company, am up 99.97%   
MRNA: When we were in mist of pandemic and there was talk about vaccines , there was report of 8 companies making them, MRNA was ahead of them all as I tracked it from phase 1 through 4, clearly was the winner so I bough sh\*\* load of it at 45-60 , was at $170 and I did not sell it, currently its sitting at $130 and my avg return is 95%.  


So what am I saying is, follow what you think it's going to rock it in future, bit of logic applied and you are golden. Now as to SPY, its a safe heaven to make gains over years and for sure it tanks every 5/10y its why avg return is I think 7% ?",0.008,0.857,0.135,0.9886

On the other hand, you stand to gain far more - GME moved 60%-ish on Friday, but the calls I had moved (in one case) from being worth $20 at open to being worth $1500 at their peak (I sold too soon), and my longer term calls went from being worth like $270 to being worth $2550 at peak (I sold for $1455). 

Calls have unlimited upside, just like stonks. Puts have limited upside but also limited downside (vs directly shorting stock).

For GME, buying shares helps trigger the short squeeze, but calls can make you more money. GME calls are also insanely expensive right now due to how volatile the stock is.

Saw some dude's bb post (had to find it no one was talking about it). Watched it closely as it started going up to 8 and got in. Then found another guy making a case for AMD and got in. Looked at probably 50 tickers and had to look at DD on them.

Indicators help, too. Like PLTR -- crossover on the 3 month and yearly macd gave nice odds for a big jump like we saw Friday. Obviously doesn't work all the time, but you can cut losses if you think you were wrong.

As a result, when Porsche increased its stake by an additional 44%, it meant that the true available float went down from 45% of outstanding shares to around just 1% of outstanding shares.
  
Another big difference is market cap. GME is not becoming a 50 billion dollar company when it loses money. It has tiny profit margins and their business model of trade ins is dead. The turnaround home run is priced in. The small market cap also means that firms aren’t going to worry about the squeeze as much as VW with market cap in the hundreds of billions.

NOK may tank and not recover in time. Or, what if the price only goes up enough to cover theta, and you come out net $0 after a whole year? Your money could’ve been put in an ETF and earned more in that time.

3229,NOK,"Sure, I'll try. But warning, it does get a little complicated, I am not an investment advisor, and I strongly suggest you read up on options by yourself. Using the NOK option I posted above:

NOK $5 1/21/22c

- Ask 0.60 
- Delta 0.4720
- Gama 0.1816
- Theta -0.0012 (roughly -0.18 in 6 month)

The **ask** is how much each share is going for, so for this particular example it's going for $0.60 per share, which means $60 a single call contract.

The **delta** is how much the option value (ask) should move up/down by per every dollar change in the stock price. So if NOK goes from $4.22 to $5.22 you can expect the call value to go from $0.60 to roughly $1.07, which means your whole call order would not be worth $107. You've made money!

Now here's where I'm a little fuzzy on the details. **Gamma** is how much delta changes with ever dollar change in the stock price. *I think* if NOK goes from $4.22 to $5.22, you should also see an additional $0.18 increase to the contract value which brings your total to $1.25 per share, or $125 for your contract. This is why you see delta increase the closer they are to the money and the further they are in the money.

But remember, the inverse is also true...

If NOK goes from $4.22 to $3.22 you can expect your $60 call to be worth roughly $15-20 now. This is rough estimate, but you get the idea. You've lost A LOT of money!

I hope this helps to illustrate the very very basics of options pricing. You should absolutely go read some Investopedia articles on it or watch some YouTube videos.

TL;DR: Assuming a $60 call, if NOK goes up by $1, call is now worth roughly $110-125 🥴 But if NOK goes down by $1, call is now worth roughly $15-20 😵",0.035,0.888,0.077,0.889
3230,NOK,"Theta is the time component that is often called “theta decay”.

It’s how much in value the option goes down by per day. Theta is NOT linear, it will **increase** as you get closer to the expiration.

This is why way out of the money weeklies are very risky, because you need the stock price to move very dramatically in the correct direction just to combat theta. 

Conceptually think of it this way, it’s much more likely for NOK to get to $10 in a year versus in a week or in a month. Therefore those yearly options (aka leaps) are much more valuable with much less theta having been decayed than anything closer.

Ok I accept this is a realistic situation where Tesla executes perfectly and gets to $250bn revenue.

Why does that imply a 1T or 2T valuation? VW made that much revenue for the last 8 years. They are valued at ~$100bn. Are EVs going to be so high margin when every company is churning out $25k models for the masses or consumers can pick from a range of premium EVs that don't suck.

People make realistic (but still optimistic) estimates for Tesla's future revenues, but then still think you can apply some insane multiplier to them once they have achieved that growth.

Cabin has nothing to do with Tesla's margins. This does. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giga_Press theres also teardowns by Sandy Munro - he's st the beginning of one on the 2021 model 3 - that take apart the car to see how their manufacturing is done. 

Not only that, but Tesla is producing batteries at volume and continually pushing that manufacturing price down as well, while making the batteries themselves better. 

They could very easily lower car prices, and they have, a bit. Tesla's main issue preventing it from offering a 25k car right now is that it doesn't have the manufacturing capacity to keep up with the kind of demand that would incur. You already have to wait 2 months for a Model 3, people would get angry if that wait became years. Of course, they have multiple factories set to come online this year, so I expect the 25k car soon.

3323,TSLA,"LOL should first read a thing or two. That said I just started like 18 trading days ago and I've turned 10k into 20.5k so you're talking to the right guy!

Anyways you first need options enabled with your brokerage. 

Options are actually cheaper than outright buying 100 stock, with the downside risk of a basic call/put being you lose all the capital you put in it.

Like a true autist, I had a ~$5000 call that turned into ~$10000 two days later as TSLA roared 15% earlier this month. Now had TSLA gone down and stayed down, I would have lost all $5000 I put into that option. This is much riskier than shares in that sense.

Anyways most people here blow up their accounts so just cuz everyone is making money now does not mean it always has been that way and always will be that way.

Understand and accept the risks associated with options and you'll be happy to reap any rewards.",0.076,0.795,0.129,0.8916
3324,GME,"What people here are doing are call options. They are a contract to buy 100 shares for an agreed upon price. So let's say GME is at $65 now. If you buy a call option from me with a price at $70, it means we enter into an agreement where you can buy 100 shares of GME from me for $70/share, no matter what the market price ends up being.

So if GME stocks go to $80, you're getting a great deal - you get to buy something worth $80 for only $70. However, if GME never reached $70, the contract is worthless - no one would want to pay a higher price for the shares than they could in the open market.

Because it's for 100 shares, the value of a contract would reflect that - each dollar GME goes up, the contract could go up by $100 (to simplify things).

Also because it's a contract based on uncertainty, I will charge you some money now for that contract. That's the price you pay, and the amount you will lose if you're wrong. This amount is much less than actually buying 100 shares of the stock. This is how you get these crazy percentages - you're spending a small amount and leveraging price movements of 100 shares. Also the more outrageous the bet, the less it'll cost (if you set the price at $200 it'll be cheaper because the seller thinks it's way less likely for GME to hit $200 than $70). No different from sports betting - you can bet on the 100 to 1 underdog with very little chance of winning, but if you do win you win big.

Because you need to be right on the direction of movement (it needs to go up), the price (what if it went up to $69 only?), and also the timing (it needs to exceed your target before the option expires), it's a high risk/high reward play.",0.057,0.817,0.126,0.9736

I truly hope gme goes to the moon. I really do. I currently own and am holding 129 shares at $62. I originally bought at $41 but was momentarily gay on Friday and sold at around $70. I quickly saw the error of my ways, bought back in, and prayed to our lord and savior papa Cohen for forgiveness. 

I just want to say that as much as I hope for the best, we need to acknowledge the risk. There are many ways this could go south and I don’t want wsb to become a laughing stock after we’ve already had so much success with this squeeze. There are a few ways/reasons I can see that we could get fucked:

1. The big boys are pissed at us, and they have more resources than we degenerates do. It’s entirely possible that now that they’ve seen people here yolo’ing the hell out of gme, they use those resources to make sure we bleed on this just like they did.
2. It’s possible the short squeeze is over. The squeeze as it is right now is already an infinite squeeze. The two examples everybody uses is VW and Apron, but here’s what happened with those. The VW squeeze of ‘08 was the longer lasting of the two, and over the course of an entire week it only caused the stock to double. The Apron squeeze of ‘20 caused the stock to grow 900%, but the entire squeeze only lasted a day. This leads me to think the longer the squeeze lasts, the less potent it is. I think this is because the longer the squeeze, the more time short sellers have to cover their positions, manage risk, and strategize. If we’re being honest with ourselves, the gme squeeze started January 12th when people thought the stock was overvalued already at $20. On Friday it was January 22nd, so more than a week had passed since the start, yet the price has more than tripled. The gme squeeze has already lasted longer than the vw squeeze and yet has been far more potent already. So please consider the possibility that 3 figures is an unrealistic target.
3. It’s possible not everyone on here is lasered into holding, since those who dissent usually get banned, even if they very well may be active in the community. Especially those who started tuning in recently and mainstream holders. Once things get rough you can bet they’ll peace out real quick. 

All this to say, I’m worried about you retards and don’t want to see you get burned. So yes, hold ur shit, to the moon 🚀🚀 and whatnot. But don’t liquidate your 401k and Roth IRA for this because there are risks you might not realize are there. Don’t put in more than you’re willing to lose.

So now, let's say you sell a share for $65 instead of holding.

That's a share they got to buy up for only $65 rather than having to pay more.

So every time you sell a share, shorts get let off the hook little by little until eventually, there aren't any more shares that have to be bought to cover the previous sake of a ""pretend share"".

Now, here's where holding comes in.

There are only so many REAL shares.  The fewer there are available under a sell order, the harder it is for the shorts to buy them up and cover.  And supply and demand tells us that when someone is highly demanded but in low supply, the price goes up.

The longer shareholders keep holding, the more these shirts are gonna get desperate, because they owe those shares (or more likely, money) to someone.

I kind of expect to get downvoted to hell and/or immediately banned because that’s what seems to happen to anyone who challenges the narrative of HOLD GME DIAMOND HANDS DUMP EVERYTHING YOU HAVE 🚀🚀🚀

I truly hope gme goes to the moon. I really do. I currently own and am holding 129 shares at $62. I originally bought at $41 but was momentarily gay on Friday and sold at around $70. I quickly saw the error of my ways, bought back in, and prayed to our lord and savior papa Cohen for forgiveness. 

I just want to say that as much as I hope for the best, we need to acknowledge the risk. There are many ways this could go south and I don’t want wsb to become a laughing stock after we’ve already had so much success with this squeeze. There are a few ways/reasons I can see that we could get fucked:

1. The big boys are pissed at us, and they have more resources than we degenerates do. It’s entirely possible that now that they’ve seen people here yolo’ing the hell out of gme, they use those resources to make sure we bleed on this just like they did.
2. It’s possible the short squeeze is over. The squeeze as it is right now is already an infinite squeeze. The two examples everybody uses is VW and Apron, but here’s what happened with those. The VW squeeze of ‘08 was the longer lasting of the two, and over the course of an entire week it only caused the stock to double. The Apron squeeze of ‘20 caused the stock to grow 900%, but the entire squeeze only lasted a day. This leads me to think the longer the squeeze lasts, the less potent it is. I think this is because the longer the squeeze, the more time short sellers have to cover their positions, manage risk, and strategize. If we’re being honest with ourselves, the gme squeeze started January 12th when people thought the stock was overvalued already at $20. On Friday it was January 22nd, so more than a week had passed since the start, yet the price has more than tripled. The gme squeeze has already lasted longer than the vw squeeze and yet has been far more potent already. So please consider the possibility that 3 figures is an unrealistic target.
3. It’s possible not everyone on here is lasered into holding, since those who dissent usually get banned, even if they very well may be active in the community. Especially those who started tuning in recently and mainstream holders. Once things get rough you can bet they’ll peace out real quick. 

All this to say, I’m worried about you retards and don’t want to see you get burned. So yes, hold ur shit, to the moon 🚀🚀 and whatnot. But don’t liquidate your 401k and Roth IRA for this because there are risks you might not realize are there. Don’t put in more than you’re willing to lose.

Short side: 
- He sold a call at 19 strike for a profit, hoping that GME will go below 19 and this call will be worthless.


He doesn’t want to be naked a short call though, because if GME goes up he needs to deliver 100 shares per contract at ANY price, only getting paid 1900... so:


Long side: 
- He buys a call at 20 strike. Now if GME does go up and his 19 gets exercised, he can buy 100 shares for 20 each then deliver them, only losing 1 dollar a share. 

The long side (20) is cheaper than the short side (19) because it is less in the money ( closer to actual stock price) so he overall makes money that is at risk until the spread expires.

 - Buy 20c - long side
 - Sell 19c - short side

The position was bullish. Imagine put credit spread that covers the price of call contract, or short expensive put that covers the cost of buying straddle. 

Short ITM put was so expensive, so when I sold it, it covered not just the price of 2 long legs, but also possible loss from the price move between long strikes. In other words, if stock is flat or goes down, I make money from ITM put theta, if price goes up, I make even more money from theta + call.

This creates a situation where even if you guess the direction the earnings will move the stock correct you can still lose money on the option from IV crush (the IV going substantially lower after earnings).

I kind of expect to get downvoted to hell and/or immediately banned because that’s what seems to happen to anyone who challenges the narrative of HOLD GME DIAMOND HANDS DUMP EVERYTHING YOU HAVE 🚀🚀🚀

I truly hope gme goes to the moon. I really do. I currently own and am holding 129 shares at $62. I originally bought at $41 but was momentarily gay on Friday and sold at around $70. I quickly saw the error of my ways, bought back in, and prayed to our lord and savior papa Cohen for forgiveness. 

I just want to say that as much as I hope for the best, we need to acknowledge the risk. There are many ways this could go south and I don’t want wsb to become a laughing stock after we’ve already had so much success with this squeeze. There are a few ways/reasons I can see that we could get fucked:

1. The big boys are pissed at us, and they have more resources than we degenerates do. It’s entirely possible that now that they’ve seen people here yolo’ing the hell out of gme, they use those resources to make sure we bleed on this just like they did.
2. It’s possible the short squeeze is over. The squeeze as it is right now is already an infinite squeeze. The two examples everybody uses is VW and Apron, but here’s what happened with those. The VW squeeze of ‘08 was the longer lasting of the two, and over the course of an entire week it only caused the stock to double. The Apron squeeze of ‘20 caused the stock to grow 900%, but the entire squeeze only lasted a day. This leads me to think the longer the squeeze lasts, the less potent it is. I think this is because the longer the squeeze, the more time short sellers have to cover their positions, manage risk, and strategize. If we’re being honest with ourselves, the gme squeeze started January 12th when people thought the stock was overvalued already at $20. On Friday it was January 22nd, so more than a week had passed since the start, yet the price has more than tripled. The gme squeeze has already lasted longer than the vw squeeze and yet has been far more potent already. So please consider the possibility that 3 figures is an unrealistic target.
3. It’s possible not everyone on here is lasered into holding, since those who dissent usually get banned, even if they very well may be active in the community. Especially those who started tuning in recently and mainstream holders. Once things get rough you can bet they’ll peace out real quick. 

All this to say, I’m worried about you retards and don’t want to see you get burned. So yes, hold ur shit, to the moon 🚀🚀 and whatnot. But don’t liquidate your 401k and Roth IRA for this because there are risks you might not realize are there. Don’t put in more than you’re willing to lose.

Consumer, broadcast, and are becoming more relevant in cinema with Fx7, fx9. I’ve worked in entertainment for 10 years and used to see a lot of hitachi / Panasonic...yea that shit is over. For low-budget films the only cameras under 20k that could compete might be black magic...But BM has insane quality control issues while Sony is releasing behemoths like the FX9 that are ahead of the market in just about every way and also don’t fucking break or require a firmware update every day. 

Canon/Nikon DSLR video? Not dead yet... dying? Absolutely. You could shoot a feature film with A7s using cine lenses and not many are going to know you didn’t use a 100k+ camera rig. I don’t know any videographers that don’t use exclusively Sony or haven’t strongly considered switching, with every new camera using something else becomes a lot less tempting.

Photography is a little different, Sony mirrorless IMO are cumbersome for pro photography which is why you’ll see most pro photographers at concerts/sports/weddings etc still using canon/nikon. The drawback in this area is speed...photographers don’t want the bells/whistles and Sony menus equivalent the size of a novella...If Sony made a bigger body camera and dumbed down the design for a pro photo focused camera then they’d put canon/Nikon in the realm of nostalgia and brand-loyalty purchases by photographers..

Amazing DD and will absolutely go long Sony. I’m ashamed and embarrassed I don’t already own it. I’m only commenting on photo/video because that’s what I know intimately and have seen Sony quickly tighten their grip on this market.",0.096,0.843,0.062,-0.8512

I guess they may get an Olympics boost in TV sales (like I said in OP). They may also get an Olympic boost in the sale of professional cameras for sports and broadcasting I guess. But it would be   
a very, very small plus to their overall bottomline. So I'd say it's neglibile.

I know the Japanese government is very keen to use the Olympics to show Japan is still an innovative, technological powerhouse. But for Sony I don't think it really matters.

IMO PC gaming is the future, but more on that another time.

I think this is a great point and I have thought about this too. However, the success of PS4 and instant sell-out of PS5 clearly shows that there is still a ton of interest in consoles, despite PC gaming having a lot of advantages.

I do think that PC gaming has many advantages over console gaming (bigger library, more flexibility (upgrade hardware whenever you want), endless customization options, better prices for games in general and online multiplayer is not locked behind paywall),.

But despite that I still don't really see console gaming going away anytime soon. This is not what the numbers in general have shown. PC gaming has always had the advantages mentioned for over a decade, but console gaming still grew over the past 10 years.

Consoles and PC gaming are both profiting for the growing gaming market as a whole, this is what market analysis shows I think. (I think it's also a very good idea to invest in companies that are more exposed to the PC gaming market btw, such as AMD, but also a publisher like Ubisoft (Ubisoft is quite undervalued compared to EA, ATVI and TTWO and they're about to crush earnings forecast, I'm 100% sure Ubi will jump after earnings report. Not so sure that Sony will beat their earnings forecast, but that's because they already drastically raised it in October. But long-term I'm very bullish on SNE as it's hopefully clear by now xD)

Consoles also have the FIFA/COD/Madden audience by the balls and I don't see that audience switching to PC. FIFA/COD/Madden sells tens of millions of units each year. FIFA is an enormous cash cow for EA and when you look at the numbers all the revenue pretty much comes from PS4, a bit from Xbox and barely anything from PC. Same thing with Madden.

It not just the ""mainstream"" audience, but it's clear that consoles also attracts the core gamers. (otherwise games like Death Stranding, Demon's Souls, Horizon etc wouldn't perform as well as they do in terms of sales).

This lead to me to believe that consoles will always have a lot of appeal. Otherwise the PS5 wouldn't be instantly sold out at launch. And otherwise demand wouldn't be through the roof. Same thing with Nintendo Switch where demand is through the roof. PS4 + Xbox One sales surpass PS3 + Xbox 360 sales launch aligned, so I don't think console gaming is going away anytime soon, though I totally undertand your point.

Next I'd add that honestly, I'd say the value proposition of the PS5 compared to PC gaming is also really good. Compared to PS4, not so much, but it's impossible to beat PS5 for $400 with the same budget for a gaming PC. (granted, a PC is multi-purpose so you can't really compare it 1 to 1). This makes me think that consoles provide a lower barrier of entry to video games than PC gaming.

On top of that, it's clear that Sony is doubling down on exclusive content so that's another USP they have. God of War, Uncharted, Spider-Man etc. Those games have been pulling in big numbers so it's clearly an important asset that Sony has.

I do think SIE should be very vigilent that PC gaming + Google Stadia + Amazon Luna + GeForce Now etc don't eat their lunch even if PlayStation is in an upwards trend. Going by their IR releases, Sony is very aware of this and they also have their own streaming service (PS Now) that they actually started way before Google and Amazon.

Finally, I'll add that Sony Corporation as a whole (so not the PlayStation business) is actually looking to make acquisitions in the gaming market, seperate from PlayStation business. Some people still seem to have the idea that Sony is a cash-poor company, but they actually have $40B in cash on hand.

This is evidenced by the fact that they made a bit to acquire Leyou (company that owns the developer behind Warframe, along with other stuff). This was a bid made by Sony Corporation and not by Sony Interactive Entertainment (PlayStation).

I do think SIE should be very vigilent that PC gaming + Google Stadia + Amazon Luna + GeForce Now etc don't eat their lunch even if PlayStation is in an upwards trend. Going by their IR releases, Sony is very aware of this and they also have their own streaming service (PS Now) that they actually started way before Google and Amazon.

Finally, I'll add that Sony Corporation as a whole (so not the PlayStation business) is actually looking to make acquisitions in the gaming market, seperate from PlayStation business. Some people still seem to have the idea that Sony is a cash-poor company, but they actually have $40B in cash on hand.

This is evidenced by the fact that they made a bit to acquire Leyou (company that owns the developer behind Warframe, along with other stuff). This was a bid made by Sony Corporation and not by Sony Interactive Entertainment (PlayStation).

3829,IMO,">While I do agree with a lot that you’re saying, this is a very optimistic point of view. For the short term, I would say most of your thesis is true (like ps5 dominating), but console gaming is becoming more and more a thing of the past, why pay subscriptions and get a second set of head phones, games and hard drives, when you can just get one set for your PC and use it for everything else like work? IMO PC gaming is the future, but more on that another time.

I think this is a great point and I have thought about this too. However, the success of PS4 and instant sell-out of PS5 clearly shows that there is still a ton of interest in consoles, despite PC gaming having a lot of advantages.

I do think that PC gaming has many advantages over console gaming (bigger library, more flexibility (upgrade hardware whenever you want), endless customization options, better prices for games in general and online multiplayer is not locked behind paywall),.

But despite that I still don't really see console gaming going away anytime soon. This is not what the numbers in general have shown. PC gaming has always had the advantages mentioned for over a decade, but console gaming still grew over the past 10 years.

Consoles and PC gaming are both profiting for the growing gaming market as a whole, this is what market analysis shows I think. (I think it's also a very good idea to invest in companies that are more exposed to the PC gaming market btw, such as AMD, but also a publisher like Ubisoft (Ubisoft is quite undervalued compared to EA, ATVI and TTWO and they're about to crush earnings forecast, I'm 100% sure Ubi will jump after earnings report. Not so sure that Sony will beat their earnings forecast, but that's because they already drastically raised it in October. But long-term I'm very bullish on SNE as it's hopefully clear by now xD)

Consoles also have the FIFA/COD/Madden audience by the balls and I don't see that audience switching to PC. FIFA/COD/Madden sells tens of millions of units each year. FIFA is an enormous cash cow for EA and when you look at the numbers all the revenue pretty much comes from PS4, a bit from Xbox and barely anything from PC. Same thing with Madden.

It not just the ""mainstream"" audience, but it's clear that consoles also attracts the core gamers. (otherwise games like Death Stranding, Demon's Souls, Horizon etc wouldn't perform as well as they do in terms of sales).

This lead to me to believe that consoles will always have a lot of appeal. Otherwise the PS5 wouldn't be instantly sold out at launch. And otherwise demand wouldn't be through the roof. Same thing with Nintendo Switch where demand is through the roof. PS4 + Xbox One sales surpass PS3 + Xbox 360 sales launch aligned, so I don't think console gaming is going away anytime soon, though I totally undertand your point.

Next I'd add that honestly, I'd say the value proposition of the PS5 compared to PC gaming is also really good. Compared to PS4, not so much, but it's impossible to beat PS5 for $400 with the same budget for a gaming PC. (granted, a PC is multi-purpose so you can't really compare it 1 to 1).

Edit since a lot of people are reading this:

Through buying a call the MM buys a number of shares up front to hedge your delta. As stock price changes so does the delta of your call. Higher stock price = higher delta = more shares the MM buys to hedge their risk. Additionally lower stock price = lower delta = less shares needed to hedge risk so the MM sells shares

Also worth nothing that short + long call is a similar position to just buying a put (with the primary difference being that you end up with a bunch of cash if you short). The put position has an advantage when it comes to MM hedging since as the price of the stock falls the delta of the put decreases (gets closer to -1) this causes the MMs to increase the number of shares they short in order to hedge the risk of the put.

At this stage this is pretty much a get out with minimum damage game for them. Let's face it, shorters have immense amount of capital compare to WSB, but they are in a hole they need to dig themselves out. In my head there are two possible broader strategies they could take:

1. Use their shit ton of money (including margins based on other collaterals in their holdings) to double down on shorting, hoping to suppress the price long enough so enough paper hands exit with relative small gains while thinking they've made out like a bandit, eventually restore some stock liquidity in the market so they can cover at the lower price.
2. Capitulate, but using their shit ton of money to manage the price curve so there wouldn't be any explosive price spikes as they cover.  

I believe they've been using plan 1 for the last few weeks. Thus the little covering we've seen so far. There are reports on additional short interests being added in the past few weeks, which further backs up this theory. But due to our  💎👐  it didn't really pan out as they would've hoped.  Also this has the massive side effect of dragging down MMs with them due to large amount of call options purchase. Not only they threw MMs under the bus, but also further reduced stock liquidity as MMs need to deliver assignments.

I think they might start to seriously consider plan 2. This is basically spending lots of money to avoid losing even more money.

To shorters, plan 1 might be a cheaper way to exit if it works out, but carries immense amount of risks. Also it hasn't worked that well so far so history is not on their side. Plan 2 is really, really expensive and needs to be very carefully executed to be worthwhile, but carries a slightly lower risk.

Coming up we might see explosive price action if they go with plan 1 but couldn't keep the lid on. Or continuous swing up and down if they act on plan 2.

At this stage this is pretty much a get out with minimum damage game for them. Let's face it, shorters have immense amount of capital compare to WSB, but they are in a hole they need to dig themselves out. In my head there are two possible broader strategies they could take:

1. Use their shit ton of money (including margins based on other collaterals in their holdings) to double down on shorting, hoping to suppress the price long enough so enough paper hands exit with relative small gains while thinking they've made out like a bandit, eventually restore some stock liquidity in the market so they can cover at the lower price.
2. Capitulate, but using their shit ton of money to manage the price curve so there wouldn't be any explosive price spikes as they cover.  

I believe they've been using plan 1 for the last few weeks. Thus the little covering we've seen so far. There are reports on additional short interests being added in the past few weeks, which further backs up this theory. But due to our  💎👐  it didn't really pan out as they would've hoped.  Also this has the massive side effect of dragging down MMs with them due to large amount of call options purchase. Not only they threw MMs under the bus, but also further reduced stock liquidity as MMs need to deliver assignments.

I think they might start to seriously consider plan 2. This is basically spending lots of money to avoid losing even more money.

To shorters, plan 1 might be a cheaper way to exit if it works out, but carries immense amount of risks. Also it hasn't worked that well so far so history is not on their side. Plan 2 is really, really expensive and needs to be very carefully executed to be worthwhile, but carries a slightly lower risk.

There is two main choices for internet here, TELUS and SHAW.  Then of course a bunch of resellers and CLECS.  Only those two companies own plant infrastructure.

Starlink sounds like a decent choice for someone in a rural setting, and one of many choices for a homeowner in an urban setting.

If they steal the Rural setting, no effect, great for those people.  Current choices are limited, there is some companies that do point to point radio.  This is the same thing, except you aim the dish up!

Business, no issue.  Max bandwidth of 150 isn't gonna steal customers, latency of 20-40ms... Lol.  That is actually terrible.  Latency and jitter are the underated most important things these days.  I would like to see actual results of someone pinging say, google.  I wanna see the latency and jitter.  VOIP and video conferencing is kinda becoming things.  Gamers this is the most important thing.  In this Regard TELUS's fiber internet wins over everyone.

Higher density area's with Condos and MDU.  Starlink won't do anything here.

Now let's get to the install, most people are afraid of a drill, so you ask a homeowner to mount a dish, and then run cables from the outside of their house to the inside, yep 95% or more will need a installer.  Someone will get paid to do this, if Starlink is gonna cover the install cost then they will make you sign a 2 year contract.  They probably won't make their money on the orig install and equip back for 3 years.   Then factor in equipment upgrades or failures.  Profit margins won't be great.  

I think Starlink is great, but it won't be a threat to Telco's in internet.  Telco's make their Bank in Wireless, cell phones.  Also, Telus is diversifying.  There big push has been the acquisition of a wack of security companies, and now they are bundling Security with Internet and TV.  It's actually a smart play.  Another big growth area is Telus Health.  They are making a play with Healthcare records and tele-health.  I actually think this is one of the most promising sides of the business.  They also have a play in Agriculture, but I can't explain that one too well.  So, if you think Starlink is gonna come in and steal a big Telco's lunch, I just don't see it, yet.

But with Papa Elon behind it, I am watching it with great interest.  I won't be running away from my boomer dividend play anytime soon.",0.06,0.752,0.188,0.9969

Speaking strictly about the cosmetics brands that they own: Over the last year or so, KKW has been seriously losing hype. Girls love watching beauty youtubers for makeup reviews and tutorials. I haven’t really seen beauty youtubers talk about KKW in a while (nor Kylie)

Looking at all the makeup brands under Coty, a majority of them are drugstore brands. Shit that you won’t find in Sephora (one of the largest cosmetics retailers, and possibly the most popular—your wife has probably dragged her boyfriend into a Sephora a few times before). Why is this important? Because bitches love Sephora (I’m one of them).

I think Coty will do something similar. They still haven't made it back to their pre covid stock price. Which was lower than revlon's. However they own better brands. For example they own both OPI and Sally Hansen. I bet you have at least one bottle by them in your bathroom. I know I do.

4240,GME,This is what I love about this place. It's the rise of the retail investor. We've band together and made a collective decision and shown the buying power of the retail investor is real and needs to be respected. I work on the PE side and tried to take our company public multiple times in 2019 and the way our underwriters turned their noses up at too much retail investor involvement was telling. Now these same guys are getting fucked on GME. To. The. Fuckin. Moon. And I don't even need a Tardis!,0.045,0.876,0.078,0.4926
4241,GME,"Guys, please think twice before yolo’ing.

I kind of expect to get downvoted to hell and/or immediately banned because that’s what seems to happen to anyone who challenges the narrative of HOLD GME DIAMOND HANDS DUMP EVERYTHING YOU HAVE 🚀🚀🚀

I truly hope gme goes to the moon. I really do. I currently own and am holding 129 shares at $62. I originally bought at $41 but was momentarily gay on Friday and sold at around $70. I quickly saw the error of my ways, bought back in, and prayed to our lord and savior papa Cohen for forgiveness. 

I just want to say that as much as I hope for the best, we need to acknowledge the risk. There are many ways this could go south and I don’t want wsb to become a laughing stock after we’ve already had so much success with this squeeze. There are a few ways/reasons I can see that we could get fucked:

1. The big boys are pissed at us, and they have more resources than we degenerates do. It’s entirely possible that now that they’ve seen people here yolo’ing the hell out of gme, they use those resources to make sure we bleed on this just like they did.
2. It’s possible the short squeeze is over. The squeeze as it is right now is already an infinite squeeze. The two examples everybody uses is VW and Apron, but here’s what happened with those. The VW squeeze of ‘08 was the longer lasting of the two, and over the course of an entire week it only caused the stock to double. The Apron squeeze of ‘20 caused the stock to grow 900%, but the entire squeeze only lasted a day. This leads me to think the longer the squeeze lasts, the less potent it is. I think this is because the longer the squeeze, the more time short sellers have to cover their positions, manage risk, and strategize. If we’re being honest with ourselves, the gme squeeze started January 12th when people thought the stock was overvalued already at $20. On Friday it was January 22nd, so more than a week had passed since the start, yet the price has more than tripled. The gme squeeze has already lasted longer than the vw squeeze and yet has been far more potent already. So please consider the possibility that 3 figures is an unrealistic target.
3. It’s possible not everyone on here is lasered into holding, since those who dissent usually get banned, even if they very well may be active in the community. Especially those who started tuning in recently and mainstream holders. Once things get rough you can bet they’ll peace out real quick. 

All this to say, I’m worried about you retards and don’t want to see you get burned. So yes, hold ur shit, to the moon 🚀🚀 and whatnot. But don’t liquidate your 401k and Roth IRA for this because there are risks you might not realize are there. Don’t put in more than you’re willing to lose.
