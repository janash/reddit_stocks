12,MSFT," I truly believe Apple is in its own ""Ballmer"" period - Jobs brought Mac, iPod, iPhone, iPad and a number of completely revolutionary things to market. Tim Cook has excelled at milking those cash cows - just like Ballmer presided over a period of record sales & profits by milking the established Windows/Office products, but completely lacked innovation (missing mobile/cloud/social trends for years - cough awful Nokia acquisition). Apple's going to continue to put out new phones and things like Airpods, etc, but none of those were truly innovative or game-changing. Cook's a supply chain/operations guy, not a product guy and while growth will continue, they won't have the necessary innovation to truly multiply stock value (the way Nadella has 7-8x MSFT stock since he took over).

Nadella is fucking amazing though. And I expect to see MSFT being a better hold long-term than Apple, unless Apple finds their own Nadella.

Edit: To everyone saying it isn't a fair comparison for Cook - fair enough. Cook's definitely been a better steward of Apple than Ballmer was of MSFT during that period. I just think (in my opinion) that the pattern of visionary CEO who creates markets --> handed off to skilled operator who exploits/grows those markets will repeat. And the real value for investors usually comes from companies who innovate and create new markets. Apple is still a good company and great stock - I hold plenty myself.

31,AR," I get what you're saying, but think you're off the mark on a few things.  For one, Apple stock has already increased 10x since Cook took over 10 years ago, to become the most valuable company in the world well into his tenure.  Microsoft stock price did almost nothing during Balmer's reign.

Cook has repeatedly stressed the importance of AR as the future, and understands the need to win that market.  First generation gear likely to hit market within the next couple of years.  Also talks of them developing their own car.  How those verticals do will determine whether Cook is seen as an innovator or operations guy in my opinion..

Also note that the market wasn't necessarily ready for this technology until very recently, and the developer ecosystem is vital to their success (see: Google Glass).  So waiting until now to pounce and milking smartphones to build the gold standard war chest in the meantime was a smart move.  Microsoft and Facebook are also aggressive players in this space though.

Either way, I don't think the Balmer comparison is fair to Cook, at least not yet.",stippleworth,227,/r/investing/comments/o5w9xy/msft_closes_at_2_trillion_as_second_us_company/h2pafbc/,0.06,0.788,0.152,0.9669

38,TV," Dude.. Cook himself said services are the new money makers. Have you not observed the launch of Apple TV or others? Tim is trying to transform an already multi trillion dollar company.

39,MSFT," I would’ve agreed with you more around 2014, but Apple has innovated in — for lack of a better word — innovative ways since then. You can’t remake the iPhone. That was a once in a blue moon moment where the tech had progressed to make things possible, but no one was taking advantage of it the right way. Apple still does stuff in that vein — I think AirPods and Apple Watch are pretty nifty, and they sell really well. 

If Tim Cook were *stifling* innovation within Apple, or letting bad projects suck the company dry, then I’d be more willing to agree, but I think he rarely (though, from what I infer, sometimes) does that. 

I think their big loss that they’ve failed to fill is Steve Jobs’s ability to sell. He could make a simple innovation seem revolutionary, and vice versa. This let the media follow along with his narrative and repeat it. 

Tim Cook’s Apple doesn’t message nearly as well. They’ve let a few PR disasters get totally away from them completely because they didn’t get in front of the story and shape the narrative. Compare the iPhone 4 Antenna issue to the iPhone 6S battery throttling “scandal.” I won’t get into a dissertation on why, but I’d argue those were equal levels of scandal. Yet, Steve Jobs’ Apple brushed it off, but Tim Cook’s Apple was too afraid to take it head on, forcefully, and get their explanation out into the media.  

But, the company continues to deliver new, interesting, high quality products that people want to buy, and they turn a good profit. They haven’t entered any markets that they’re totally out of their depth in, as Ballmer did with MSFT. They aren’t criminally neglecting any of their core product lines, and they aren’t losing direction as a company.

I'm honestly expecting that they will shortly do another one... if they can keep raising a $1B a week with a 2% decrease in share price they should.

72,AR," Thats the thing, it’s very gimmicky right now because it’s so early but there’s a ton of potential in AR. 

Like you said, construction is a great example.  Surgeons and doctors could make great use of things like this to keep information available at a glance

In Education it has literally limitless possibilities. Imagine instead of listening to a teacher lecture about chemistry you could observe molecular level chemistry and interact with it right in front of your eyes, exploring atoms with holograms and your hands. That would be absolutely awesome. 

[things like this](https://twitter.com/domhofdesign/status/1359587098043568133?s=21)

Doing conversions and translations before your eyes. Ever use Google lens? You could do something like that and identify objects you’re looking at or note down phone numbers, etc etc

Navigation 

I could go on, but my point is the potential is awesome and it goes far beyond gaming and gimmicky stuff like seeing 3D models of sharks in your living room.

73,MP," I think MP Materials should be at the top of this list. 

- Highest ore concentration in North America and possibly worldwide. Have plenty of land to ensure decades of mining. 

- Only rare earth miner in North America and in California no less. 

- Up and running with ~$2b value in equipment and existing facilities. 

- Working on next stage to process and refine on site (existing building). This is huge because it acts to protect national security and domestic supply chains for anything EV/drone/robotics requiring specialized magnets. It would otherwise go to China for refinement. 

- Obvious tailwinds with infrastructure plans and protecting domestic supply chains becoming evermore important.

Did I mention they're already profitable and have beat expectations the last two quarters as a publicly traded company? 

Also worth mentioning they have and are still caught up in SPAC, growth and Chamath related downward pressure. Those that have looked under the hood realize it's far from being in SPAC-land with companies 3+ years away from profitability. 

This is a long term hold for me and any dips are buying opportunities.

Silver, in particular, is the most conductive element on the table, and thus is used heavily in solar panels, batteries, chips, the list goes on. Very big ESG theme there, which the market is expecting to be popular with this administration.

101,MP," I'm excited for the long term when they're both mining and processing the material on site. A one stop shop if you will. 

I also trust management to watch the numbers closely and ensure its run properly as they have a finance/hedge fund background and majority ownership as well. Something I think will be valuable when it comes to mining. 

I really don't have any bear case other than still having to send the material to China for processing. That same company has ~8 stake in MP that is contingent on no interruptions to MP transition to in-house processing so I don't anticipate that being an issue. 

I suppose you could argue the infrastructure bill and funding towards domestic security of supply chains could stagnate or not be passed. That said, of all the squabbling that goes on I think it's safe to say infrastructure/security is mostly bipartisan and because of the China concern it'll be passed in one form or another.",anthonyjh21,2,/r/investing/comments/o6f092/mining_stocks_you_should_be_looking_into/h2srlcx/,0.055,0.835,0.11,0.8519

117,IBKR," depends on your account type.

for ibkr pro, the main goal is to hit the target of 100K USD in IBKR. that way you no longer have to pay monthly fees.

check if you are able to open a IBKR Lite account, which does not have such fees (but iirc its only for US citizens).

the IMPORTANT thing is to take note of the monthly fees! If you are below 26yo, you only pay 3USD a month, but after that you pay 10USD a month! 

Do some calculations to see if based on your trading activity, the commissions generated by you can justify the monthly fee, since you only pay the difference (ie if you pay 2USD commission in a month, you only need to pay 3-2=1USD, or 10-2=8USD if >26yo).",pm_me_panty_picts,0,/r/investing/comments/o629s9/ibkr_for_investing_long_term_for_an_international/h2pwsuf/,0.083,0.903,0.013,-0.639

I think I can easily have 100k by the time I leave the US, (so no fees I suppose?).

120,MSFT," I've been picking stocks since 2014. I've seen years outperforming the index and years underperforming. On average I'm still underperforming but I hope to overcome that average in 2021.

That being said, I prefer stock picking and advice young people expecting to invest for the rest of their lives to do so for a couple of years. Classic advice like time in the market beats timing the market, market indexes outperform retail investors +90% of the time and take risks when you're young are interesting theories. But you never learn about investing like when you pick your stock and win/lose, including about the classics. Learning about asset classes, markets, sectors, financial reports, brokers, shorts and options and everything/one impacting prices will take a few years.

In my experience hedging can be worth it but as a retail investor diversification almost certainly is not. To find out if MSFT is a reasonable investment is difficult enough by itself. Adjusting your risk profile to the MSFT investment involves so much analysis you have to resort to statistics - defeating the purpose of personal stock picking in my opinion. I've backtracked my strategies sometimes and as a tech oriented investor I've not seen many occasions in which diversification based on the statistics I had access to would have yielded better returns compared to not doing so and holding for a few weeks.

My final two cents: 

\- the financial sector is unforgiving: reports are 500+ pages, news comes from anywhere, anytime, their risk and performance is hard to predict, they go through great lengths to hide info and not meeting expectations is like failing to protect your family; they will not be liked

\- differentiate investments into defensive and opportunistic. For opportunistic investments write down a strategy and track it.",iminfornow,1,/r/investing/comments/o626pb/diversification_is_for_idiots/h2q9dnc/,0.085,0.796,0.119,0.9378

122,DOCN," To be honest investing is not that hard if you don't over analyze. Overanalyzing can make you infer stupid shit.

The basic premise is to invest in a company that will be here 10 years from now which will have a moat that will continue to grow.

Based on the list above I think that google for example has a great moat. Be it YouTube, playstore, Gmail, maps and other stuff.

MSFT is another example where it is hard to compete with them also. They are the fastest growing in cloud computing and their enterprise software is second to none.

Netflix eventhough lots of people do not like it, I think will have a future. Their penetration in international markets will be hard to stop, because they have gained so much market share.

Ofcourse valuation is key on making money. That is why the best thing to do is to buy in the range of 20 to 30 P/E.

If you want defensive stocks. 

You can buy Pepsi, Toyota or jnj.

All these companies have a long track record with good dividend growth. Mix both these strategies and never invest in companies that you do not know the product.

Risk is how much down side you lose if you sell at a loss...it's a time constrained concept.

131,MSFT," Oof. Let me break down why I think your working for ""big money"" has fossilized you.

When I say big money I think in terms of millions. You're probably now thinking in terms of 10s or 100s of millions and thats entirely different problem.

And I have no comment on that problem. Eventually amounts will crowd you out of markets.

Look at TSLA. $100 Million blew that market apart. It didn't break 630 because of any other reason than someone injected $100mil in first 10 minutes of trading.

Doing that day over day is not sustainable so you can't wash a 20% return out of that big of money.

Writing options for what you can't forecast is precisely the point of options. 

An options that has a known value is worthless. 

So you're getting it backwards. 

There's a line of predictability that options vaporize on. That's the line that historical performance has worked out to.

I think this guy explains it nice and concisely about the probability of landing in the money on SPY.

https://youtu.be/dgisRHEQ2FM

He also isn't advocating it. He's very cynical.

Your definition of risk is literally where you are going wrong.

If I expect 20% return and get 18% did I have only 2% risk?

Expectation is an entirely unrelated feature of risk.

Risk should mean how much loss will I certainly have if I placed a stop at that point. 

If I accept a 2% loss now what's the probability I get stopped there?

If I know the stock will always go higher 1 or 2 or 3 years from now. I can have no stop. Therefore no risk.

At the sacrifice of time.

And that is literally the philosophy of DCA.

Buy and hold and you'll never lose. You'll get an expected return.

153,DK," Hi all,

I am a dude from Denmark currently living in Canada. I want to start investing, and found that  ETFs are probably best for me. My concern is that ETFs are a long term investment. I have lived abroad for 2 years and will continue to do so for another 2, but then I am heading home to Denmark (most likely). I have all my money in Canada. Can I start investing here, and move my stocks to Denmark when times come? Or will I have to sell them all and re-buy them, losing money to taxes most likely? I am also concerned about this because I hear a lot about stocks being overpriced and perhaps going down over the next while, perhaps meaning it would be better to wait investing till I am back in DK. Looking to invest about 20K, 40/50% split on US and world indexes.

I hope that one day we see real reporting on WSB that investigates how this all came together rather than pushing the narrative of a bunch of scrappy, heroic rebels taking down Wall Street. We make the hedge funds and short sellers out to be the villains of the story (and they are), but let’s not act like there was not a coordinated effort at WSB, complete with secret threads making fun of all the idiots who were buying high, concocting misinformation to keep people buying, using brigade downvoting tactics to suppress information to the contrary and designed to encourage the frenzy all so these people could jump off at the top with their golden parachute and then leave others with the losses of the inevitable crash. They are no more heroes than the hedge fund brokers.

In short, there was a coordinated effort to make GME into a faux-social movement so others could profit at the expense of less sophisticated retail buyers. Frankly, we are treating people like heroes who are little more than an informal investment group who used, and spread, misinformation for their own gain.

157,GME," Although I, like anyone else, don't want this forum to devolve into meme-stock cult hivemind, I don't necessarily know if I agree with locking and deleting threads such as the one with links to a supposed former aide of Liz Warren. Let these threads come to light, and dismiss their bullshit claims like so:

>“As FTDs were spiking and the situation became more and more unsustainable for the shorts towards the end of January, illegal Deep ITM [call] options purchasing was used to naked short and cover FTDs,” he said. The chart below, compiled from historical options data, shows that on January 27, 25 million shares were acquired in this fashion. Overall, this technique conjured up to 150 million naked short shares. The blue line on the chart tracks fails to deliver as a percentage of float. These nearly disappear after January 27.

What the fuck am I reading here?

1) Purchasing deep ITM calls isn't illegal

2) Purchasing ITM calls is equivalent to buying shares, so how does that equate to shorting a stock? It's a bullish purchase.

3) Buying millions of ITM calls cannot create ""150 million short shares"" -- that doesn't even make sense.

Similar disinformation elsewhere: married puts somehow constituting a short position.

Protip: if you buy 100 shares and then buy an ATM put, if the price of a stock drops, you still *lose* money -- just not as much as you would've lost if you *hadn't* bought the put. That's why they call these sorts of options *insurance*.

Just more psychotic ramblings by GME anons interspersed with genuine, good analysis. The article is a toilet made of gold; just beware the shit.

179,GME," OK, here's why I'm denying it.

Right now, if I want to buy a new game, I can go to my game room, power up my PS4, navigate to the store, select the game, buy it, download it, do something else for 5 minutes, then boom, I have a new game. *And* I almost always can get some kind of sale. *And* with PS Plus I get 2 or 3 free games a month. And I *rarely* even buy new games because the back catalog available to me through PS Now is more games than I can play in what's left of my lifetime.

What is **GME** going to offer me that beats the above consumer experience? As in, why would I (I don't even know how this would work), go to a GME digital store and get said game onto my system? How and why would Sony allow that? 

I've seen people arguing that GME's moving away from brick and mortar and carving out a new digital space. Then I've seen other people arguing they're going to turn their stores into new-style arcades or e-sports hubs. Well, *which is it*?

184,UI," I agree, but M1 requires a highly refined OS to truly realize the potential. Apple was first past the post, but the other tech companies will catch up rapidly.

edit: I agree its a gamechanger from a technological POV, I even went and bought one, but its not going to raise Apple to 500/share. Its been out for months and Apple's stock hasn't really increased much. Overall, apple isn't doing anything to add to revenue, they aren't pulling in new adopters. They do the same old same old just in different wraps. They are at least 2 years behind on UI of their mobile phone platform. As such, all they do it feed their core base of buyers new products, at a huge markup, every 12-24 months. But unless they do something like iPod or original iPhone level of innovative, I don't look to see Apple over 200 for a long time. The M1 is cutting edge, but it's not iPod-level innovative and will rapidly be matched in the hardware space.",chronictherapist,1,/r/investing/comments/o6912o/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/h2rtvxe/,0.024,0.834,0.142,0.9698
185,GME," While I'm very in on GME - I don't think this would ever happen for the sole reason that Microsoft and Sony don't want this - they would fight this from happening tooth and nail. It's just very unlikely, even though it would be a fantastic way to manage the used game market. You've got to remember that Sony and Microsoft would have to help in the creation of the infrastructure for a marketplace like that.

At the moment, it's not like anyone who buys a used game  has any control over it - it's permanently locked to your PS/Xbox account. It's not like the good old days of PC games where you had a serial number that you could reuse over and over again. No user would be able to just go and submit one of the games they own to Gamestop's marketplace.

I think it's far more likely that the blockchain they're building will be for collectibles, the typical sort of NFT stuff you see floating around at the moment: animated images, models, etc.",pightle,1,/r/investing/comments/o6912o/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/h2snrss/,0.046,0.859,0.095,0.8304

194,GME," >Who's to say they can't pioneer the next era of gaming?

I don't think that anyone here is saying that. I do believe that there is no bear case for GME. But at the same time, there really isn't a bull thesis for GME either at this valuation. 

You are essentially valuing a startup company at 15bn which just raised 1.7bn who must still shutdown a brick and mortar operation, take the charges to layoff all those employees, etc. 

I don't know what experience you have with startups but I've worked at a few and it's very difficult. And I imagine that it would be a lot more difficult with the baggage attached to the existing Gamestop business to pivot entirely. 

Having a war-chest of cash doesn't guarantee success. Look at Quibi - they raised 1.7bn and they had to shutdown after a few years. And they were coming from a green-field position. 

I don't particularly like to see any company fail. People get laid off and wealth can be lost. But this kind of narrative that is being pushed around by the GME crowd is based on conspiracy theories without regard to any reality of how business works and the amount of effort that it takes to run and grow a business.",greytoc,6,/r/investing/comments/o6912o/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/h2scf2v/,0.146,0.821,0.033,-0.9767
195,GME," And who is to say that they will? As of yet they haven't executed anything except raising money from a bunch of retail who bought in at extremely inflated prices.

The whole idea of getting in on a turnaround story is to buy in when it is undervalued because it has been growing new business but wall street is still pricing it for imminent bankruptcy. GME hasn't been growing anything new so far, but is already priced like it has about a decade of growth under its belt. Best case scenario, GME sees 0% aggregate growth in stock price over the next decade (and that is assuming it actually does turn around in a very explosive way). Buying and holding right now is a terrible idea. 

Now if you decide to ride the sentiment or institute a covered call income strategy off of it.... well that is very feasible, and I made a fair amount of money off of its second run up, although I think the next time we have an actual correction it is quite possible the stock price implodes and takes the position with it.",Joeyjoejoejabadu,2,/r/investing/comments/o6912o/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/h2so0r9/,0.021,0.854,0.125,0.9623
196,PT," I think the irresponsible levels of naked shorting will send it the other way, but time will tell I suppose.

Reputable analysts have a PT much higher than what it is now, so as I said to someone else, it's nice to get different perspectives when trying to assess the true value of a security.
