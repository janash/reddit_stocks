19,GME," Probably a redundant question but...

So what happens April 16th 2021? Does DFV exercise those calls then, or before at a peak? I know GME should go Alpha Centauri by then, which speaks for itself. But if it doesn't, just exercise and hold until it does? What's the exit plan? Gotta cash in for the tendies at some point. Unless you plan on just owning the stocks forever, which I don't condemn, but I also don't plan on doing. I'm holding for you guys, i could be day trading, but I'm not because i believe in you guys and GME/AMC. I'm actually missing out on daily profits because i believe this one is THE one not to miss. I don't want to step off the GME/AMC train just to grab a quick burger and coke only to turn around not being able get back on board and seeing you guys taking off into outer space without me. What say you apes? We are coming up to a milestone and we need to know what everyone is doing so we can continue to hold as a group if need be. I'll admit, I've only got diamond hands as long as you guys do. In this case I'm not a leader. But I'm also not a weak follower. I can't buy the dips cause in all in. Have been for quite some time.

33,GME," 200% growth on E-commerce is pretty clutch too. Shows the restructuring is going very well. They also have $100,000,000 more cash on hand than they did this time last year, and they cut their net losses in half from 2019.

Their current market cap is $13 billion. They're probably going to do that in revenue in 2021 alone lmao. People so distracted by the squeeze they're failing to realize, at it's current price, GME is still a good long term play.

Edit 2: Since my qwik maff got me visibility, check out this section from the GME filing:

>In addition, from January 11, 2021 to March 17, 2021, the closing price of our Class A Common Stock on the NYSE ranged from as low as $19.94 to as high as $347.51 and daily trading volume ranged from approximately 7,060,000 to 197,200,000 shares. 

They also mentioned that:

>A ‚Äúshort squeeze‚Äù due to a sudden increase in demand for shares of our Class A Common Stock that largely exceeds supply has led to, and may continue to lead to, extreme price volatility in shares of our Class A Common Stock.

As a risk factor. Meaning after March 17, they still think GME could (not for sure) get squoozed. Another comment elsewhere mentioned that the term ""short squeeze"" only shows up 58 times in all 10-K filling with the SEC, IIRC.

#NOT BEING ABLE TO TRY THEM OUT!!!!


If gameStop had 'demo' areas where you could game for a bit or program, like, pay some $ to use the hardware for 1 hour in store, or rent, and return (in prstine condition, you are fined like a muddafukka if it has scratches etc... camera evidence or whatever upon sending it out/returning).

Don't think any other business is diong this... Like.. I want to try out the Logitech G915, but i dont want to order it, find out i dont like it, then ship it back etc.

If i could sit down in a **'LAN pc/Gaming style area'** (small pit with 10-20 comps, rotate games mon-sun, e.g. valorant on Mon,Thurs, LoL on Tues,Wed,Sat,  Game X on Sun) and frag other in store customers also trying out gear, while i get to test out a 240 Hz monitor.... that would be awesome. PLUS its a way to meet new friends... cmon us millenials/zoomers are fucking lonely, have very little friends and hardly meet new people since we stay inside all the time gaming.

66,GME," >Actually GME has a huge potential to dominated the video gaming industry.  Could even compete with steam in my opinion. Before you burn me just hear me out.

&#x200B;

1. The video gaming industry is very divided industry by individual publishers, sure steam is massive but only mostly in pc game (in my opinion lately gotten very lazy with their monopolistic attitude abusing game publishers, having poorly optimized ports like nier, etc. They are too busy making halflife 3 by putting grapes in Lord Gabens mouth). Industry is divided Xbox and ps3 have their own stores and collectibles, origin store is mostly all ea works, epic is CCP. There is no universial HUB platform where all these games can sell on. Thus a huge potential opportunity is there in a growing industry for an amazon like platform  

2. Microsoft signed on a multi year strategic partnership with GME, with revenue split share on digital goods even goods not sold by gamestop. (Microsoft is also interested in helping gme develop since they are also powering their servers and staff members.) This is the same microsoft that is aggressively trying to unite the video gaming industry using their servers   

3. Gamestop has massive distributions networks through out the world, aside from just games they can actually distribute items, part, game, collectible, tv, gaming chairs, all gaming related potential products to customers using the door dash drivers.   

4. They now have global marketing on a world scale all free at zero cost and a cult like following ape plus richer paper hands. Plus a god damn movie
5. Power house executive team from google, microsoft, amazon, Nintendo  all directed by Ryan who is experienced at beating amazon at their own game.  Ryan even stated that he wants to beat amazon 
6. if you notice their 2.0 stores have a e tournament build as well where they want to host gaming tournaments. if you've notice they also have built one of the largest e sport arena and development centers in America (Potential future project opportunity) 
7. Gamestop has a powerful member reward system 

Imagine if Ryan,  actually create a ecommerce platform technology company with actual distribution network that can deliver products to customers, powered by a ecommerce powerhouse team and technology backed by a powerhouse server tech company. The company also has showroom for customers engaging them in social events that bring customers together through friendly events and global tournament. With free global marketing and cult like following who would go crazy like cheering at picture you take at mcdonalds. 

&#x200B;

Imagine if steam and amazon had a baby. This is easily a heavily discounted video game amazon company in the making

71,IT," >Don't see why it wouldn't be in the States as well.

I've been involved in three LAN gaming cafe startups in the US, and consulted on several others over the past 20 years.  I have a background in IT, so I was always brought in to build out the network and gaming PCs.  Earliest one was in 2001.  Had players on old Athlon boxes playing games like Runescape, Dark Age of Camelot, and Tribes.  Lots of Quake, too.

They all failed over the years.  Every single one.  Most lasted less than two years.  There was a pattern they would follow.  The place would open, people would attend, and things would be good for a while.  Great, even.  Then a certain subset of people would show up.  The type that didn't suffer from an over-abundance of good parenting.  For one reason or another, the environment would become somewhere most wouldn't want to be.  The outbursts, the smell, the layer of filth on all the equipment.  A complete lack of respect would be shown for the shared equipment they were using.  

Long story short, American culture isn't set up for something like a gaming cafe.  Especially American gaming culture.  Too many of them consider it someone else's job to clean up after them.  I'm in education now, teaching kids programming and electronics.  Things haven't gotten better.  Kids are even less well-behaved these days.  Parents are even more incapable of disciplining their kids, and teaching them to respect something like the shared equipment at a gaming cafe.

The new generation of console are in my opinion glorified PCs and the new generation of digital games are just like steam keys. They just need an app to hold their juicy console keys but why you may ask? It's not like you can play anywhere your xbox/playstation/nintendo games except for the console they are on?

Let me introduce you to cloud gaming [https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass/cloud-gaming](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass/cloud-gaming) Great this is only for xbox games you may say, sony and nintendo will never be part of this!

This addresses the legendary question will Nintendo sell more games if its games worked on playstation and xbox etc. Why would they do that wouldn't they losses money on their consoles sales? They've always lost money on console this isn't anything really new. These console are majority all lost leaders to get people to buy the more extremely highly profitable ""games""

I'm just saying there maybe a potential opportunity of a console key app store that will hold keys to games of different consoles if they can play cross play games through cloud computing but why Gamestop. Aside from it's history , legacy, new cult following, the recent global free marketing and it strategic multi year partnership with Microsoft. It has something steam doesn't. Physical stores across the world and a global distribution network all already paid for. Hear me out. Steam has a very successful key loot box, digital ingame assets market place. Imagine if Gamestop had the same thing but with actual assets as well like controllers, collector items, tv, electronics, plus of course the same digital ingame assets but for consoles.

Not saying the private company steam is in any weak position in the digital world but they really maybe too busy feeding lord gaben our hard earned steam sale money instead of addressing and helping out publishers who give the platform it's products. [https://medium.com/nyc-design/why-publishers-leave-steam-a-make-your-own-platform-trend-f747922635d2](https://medium.com/nyc-design/why-publishers-leave-steam-a-make-your-own-platform-trend-f747922635d2)



I'm actually making the opinion piece that all this seems to fall in line with Microsoft decades long gaming vision. That Gamestop is the face of this movement but Microsoft is actually moving the pieces toward this.

They are actively supporting projects with the goal of uniting the gaming platforms [https://www.pcgamer.com/gogs-quest-to-unite-all-game-launchers-just-might-work-and-microsoft-is-already-on-board/](https://www.pcgamer.com/gogs-quest-to-unite-all-game-launchers-just-might-work-and-microsoft-is-already-on-board/)

They are very active with acquisitions of video game publishers [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox\_Game\_Studios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Game_Studios)

They even was so aggressive to try to buyout nintendo, and tried multiple time to unite the console world many years ago in the past(they failed of course) [https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-wanted-to-buy-nintendo-145746874.html](https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-wanted-to-buy-nintendo-145746874.html) [https://www.eteknix.com/sony-nintendo-rejected-microsofts-joint-console-plan/](https://www.eteknix.com/sony-nintendo-rejected-microsofts-joint-console-plan/)

They may see Gamestop as the Charmastic forerunner who can hid their intentions to unite the gaming industry under Microsoft. They signed on a very lucrative deal with Gamestop powering its distribution center and staff with Microsoft cloud technologies and servers. They perhaps may have seen the potential of GME team and their ecommerce vision. If Microsoft focused on what they did best servers and cloud technologies they would be the biggest beneficiaries if GME achieve it's targets of becoming an ecommerce platform. They even shared their digital revenues with GME and odd offering at no benefit to Microsoft.

95,EA," 1. Whats so funny? It's an accurate statement. The only wishful thinking is wondering if gamestop could consolidate all of the spread out publishers again. EA at least realized origin is a pile of shit and is working with microsoft. I expect some others to probably fold back in to other streaming platforms given time. They only ever launched their services as a vehicle for microtransactions anyways. As long as they could keep shoving those up everyones ass they'll sell on what ever platform.

2. Doesnt mean much? That they partnered with microsoft? Lol ok stupid.

3. yes it is plausible.

4. You were wrong.

5. Empty statement that a team of executives who know what they are doing in the digital retail space are replacing a bunch of boomer dinosaurs who were running gamestop into the ground like the next blockbuster? Again you are quite stupid.

6. People go to physical locations to watch sports all the time genius. 

7. No maybe about it. They have customer data going back more then a decade. That kind of massive amount of consumer data is incredibly valuable. ""They have the least competitive pricing"" Im not surprised you don't realize that this is something that could easily change since you thought the entire board being replaced was an empty statement.

Focusing on just the 23 individual stocks in the list 19 of them have had extremely high volatility recently measuring in the hundreds to thousands of percent. It's hard to say if these necessarily are short squeezes but I think it's safe to say that this verbiage provided in a 10-K form is indicative that the company understands that the conditions are favorable for short squeezes and other high volatility phenomena 

another interesting thing I noted was a few of the stocks were driven down to near zero which is very indicative of an attempt to bankrupt companies so the hedgies don't have to pay back their made up shares.

After seeing it go from 40 back to 400 confirms to me that this is all bullshit and I was an idiot to ""cut my losses"" when they tanked the price in January.  Since then I have bought back half my position at the same cost but it doesn't matter, this time it's personal.

They technically already could because GME has an atm prospectus from December (which they reference).

That prospectus, however, is part of a shelf registration statement that automatically incorporates certain subsequent filings, like Annual Reports.

Everything will be okay. Remember that this is war. GME isn't going to win every battle. The most important step your can take is always the next one. Take the next step y'all, regardless of how difficult that step may be. Don't lose yourself to the madness. Remember what truly matters to you. Tomorrow is another day.

**4:06 Update**

My job chose a terrible time to dump me with work.

Please forgive me delay. I'm fine. Nothing bad happened.

I'm honestly really impressed with today. Since 2pm, there was a steady climb down with a small uptick in volume. This brought it all the way down to 120. 

I'm not sure if this was a long and deliberate attack. If the price continues to drop after hours, I would lean to believe that it wasn't all natural. The volume today was around 22,000,000, which still seems pretty low all things considered. I would have expected quite a bit more for this kind of price change.

Obvious to say that this is going to be a test for a lot of GME holders. Shorts, however, still need to be bought. 

I'll do research tonight and give a better response to this tomorrow evening. There's a lot of information to digest and I haven't had the opportunity to keep up over the past two hours.

Always ask yourself if anything has changed in relation to why you bought in the first place. Does the thesis still hold?

There's still a lot of time for things to change this week.

Current price: 120.33

**1:56 Update**

And here's the slow rise back up. This just looks like long, slow volatility. If it pushes to 150, I may change my mind.

I'm seeing reports that GME has been removed from the database that tracks shorts. I do not know what the implications of that are. I would very much like an explanation as to why that information is no longer available.

Current price: 146.57

**1:40 Update**

GME has been slowly trending down. I don't know if this is general volatility or a slow push down. We'll see if GME makes it's way below 140.

Someone pointed out that IBorrowDesk hasn't updated since 12:15. Does anyone have a website where we can find an updated shorts number?

I want to believe that this is just a glitch, but with all of the information that's already hidden from us, I wouldn't be surprised if the lack of updates was intentional.

I just want to know who's taking out shorts, when those shorts are thrown into the market, and when those shorts close. How the hell is anyone able to make an informed decision when such a massive portion of information is withheld.

Someone does have that information and is keeping that information secret to profit from it.

Can I run for the SEC? Is that legal? 

Current price: 144.45

**1:18 Update**

Honestly, I'm surprised at how slow it's been. I legit thought we would see some massive volatility. It really does seem like a lot of people weren't fazed by the early drop.

If we had seen a consistent downward trajectory after the initial drop with consistently strong volume, I'd argue that retail is selling, but the longer we go with GME stable and low volume, the more I'm convinced that ER didn't actually have that big of an impact on the general consensus of the stock.

Yes, the price is down nearly 20%, but it's still not anywhere close to pre squeeze levels. If the ER was actually bad, why isn't GME back below $50.

Shorts still need to be bought.

Current price: 146.05

**1:02 Update**

Shorts available have been fluctuating a few thousand every 15 minutes or so. I haven't mentioned it because I don't see a discernable effect on the price. There are so many shorts out there that 1,000 more here or there is not really significant.

GME hasn't been able to support itself at 150. The lunch bump died off. Volume died off. GME is hovering around 148. This may actually end up being a slow day after that big morning sell off.

If that's the case, it means that the earnings report really didn't have a major impact on people's minds. The level of propaganda and posturing does not match the volume, so I'm led to believe that the manipulation tactics aren't working.

Shorts still have to be bought eventually. There are a lot of people who seem to be holding until the shorts close.

We'll see if there's any action in the next 3 hours, but GME may need a strong positive catalyst to jump start the engine again.

Shorts available: 4,000

Current price: 147.82

**12:33 Update**

GME seems to have stalled a bit. If it can support itself at 150, I'd take that the negative reaction from this mornings sell off has gone away. 

If GME can make steady progress throughout the next three days, it may cross 200 by the end of the week.

I seriously can't believe that I have people continuously sending abusive messages to me. I never thought I would every get so much recognition that I'd have dedicated haters. I really appreciate you all and hope that it continues. I'd much rather you send that shit my way than to other people who might actually be negatively affected by that kind of trauma.

My favorite thing is that they claim my content has 0 analysis and that this is nothing but a personal diary. I agree with both of those facts. I've never claimed that I know anything about how the stock market works and I really don't believe that anyone that reads this actually considers this anything other than entertainment.

Current price: 150.98

**12:24 Update**

GME has grown $12, or 8.5% over the past hour. If this percentage growth continues GME could hit 170 by the end of the day.

That is only one of many possibilities. There is still a lot of market left that will alter that trajectory.

Current price: 152.80

**12:18 Update**

This is what I consider a retail bump. There is slow and steady growth as if millions of people are all making small trades over a large period of time. I expect this will continue as steady growth unless we see a sharp decline from a Short attack. 

Current price: 154.32

**11:55 Update**

Here comes lunch! Let's see if there's a run.

Current price: 146.12

**11:38 Update**

You know what makes Reddit really unique? This is the only platform where information is democratized. In every other medium, the content is decided by a single person. That person will most likely do what benefits them the most. Here on Reddit, everyone has the ability to do their own DD on a post and decide whether it's helpful or not. In no other medium can a random person's thoughts like mine be seen by literally millions of people.

I'm just a random dude that is posting what he sees. I do this for fun and to point out something that literally no other medium is expressing, that this system is absolutely fucked up. I'd be doing this with or without the upvotes, awards, or audience. It just happens that there are a lot of people who find my thoughts interesting enough for them to be seen.

Current price: 145.29

**11:26 Update**

Shorts available went up 20,000 before dropping down to 6,000.

Meanwhile lunch is coming up, and GME looks like it might start an upward climb. Today has been fascinating. Let's see if retail has something to say. Its going to be difficult for GME to hit the green, but I'm still not ruling out the realm of possibility.

Shorts available: 6,000

Current price: 146.15

**11:15 Update**

GME experienced another dip, but it still seems that there's a lot of resistance at 140. It'll be interesting to see if GME can break that.

I appreciate the love y'all. Those abusive shits don't bother me. If anything the fact that this exploded today was significant when it comes to understanding what is actually going on.

There is a large manipulation campaign going on. Look at places that claim to be the true WSB. Some of these places are starting to look and sound like a Wallstreet version of TD. What's the point of doing all of this unless you have a very vested interest in the destruction of a public corporation?

Current price: 143.59

**10:58 Update**

Volume has died since opening bell. I'm not entirely sure what to make of this. If there was a panic sell from retail, I feel like we would be seeing a more steady decline. Instead, we saw a sharp push down, followed by a small rebound, followed by a settling at around 147. I can't imagine that all of retail made up their minds in the first hour and all collectively agreed at 147. If there was more volume, I would have expected to see stronger volatility. If anything, it means that a lot of people still haven't made up their minds.

Current price: 145.04

**10:48 Update**

I feel comfortable enough to say that GME has settled at around 147. HFs are probably happy with this position. However they SHOULD be running out of shorts, so if there's a massive lunch push up, it'll be difficult for them to contain. We'll see how volume will stack up.

Shorts available: 8,000

Current price: 147.16

**10:30 Update**

The one thing I've noticed is the large amount of negativity and abuse against GME pointed directly at people.

I've never received so much negativity about my posts.

If you don't like it, why are you paying attention? If you don't care about the stock, why are you reaching out to me?

If someone is trying to establish some sort of superiority over you, they will probably gain an advantage by supressing you and your beliefs.

If this was a natural drop, nobody would be reaching out to me with such abuse. There are people who actively are trying to convince me to stop updating.

If you don't like the stock anymore, go do something more productive with your life than trying to shit on people having fun.

I just want to know who's taking out shorts, when those shorts are thrown into the market, and when those shorts close. How the hell is anyone able to make an informed decision when such a massive portion of information is withheld.

Someone does have that information and is keeping that information secret to profit from it.

Can I run for the SEC? Is that legal? 

Current price: 144.45

**1:18 Update**

Honestly, I'm surprised at how slow it's been. I legit thought we would see some massive volatility. It really does seem like a lot of people weren't fazed by the early drop.

If we had seen a consistent downward trajectory after the initial drop with consistently strong volume, I'd argue that retail is selling, but the longer we go with GME stable and low volume, the more I'm convinced that ER didn't actually have that big of an impact on the general consensus of the stock.

Yes, the price is down nearly 20%, but it's still not anywhere close to pre squeeze levels. If the ER was actually bad, why isn't GME back below $50.

Shorts still need to be bought.

Current price: 146.05

**1:02 Update**

Shorts available have been fluctuating a few thousand every 15 minutes or so. I haven't mentioned it because I don't see a discernable effect on the price. There are so many shorts out there that 1,000 more here or there is not really significant.

GME hasn't been able to support itself at 150. The lunch bump died off. Volume died off. GME is hovering around 148. This may actually end up being a slow day after that big morning sell off.

If that's the case, it means that the earnings report really didn't have a major impact on people's minds. The level of propaganda and posturing does not match the volume, so I'm led to believe that the manipulation tactics aren't working.

Shorts still have to be bought eventually. There are a lot of people who seem to be holding until the shorts close.

We'll see if there's any action in the next 3 hours, but GME may need a strong positive catalyst to jump start the engine again.

Shorts available: 4,000

Current price: 147.82

**12:33 Update**

GME seems to have stalled a bit. If it can support itself at 150, I'd take that the negative reaction from this mornings sell off has gone away. 

If GME can make steady progress throughout the next three days, it may cross 200 by the end of the week.

I seriously can't believe that I have people continuously sending abusive messages to me. I never thought I would every get so much recognition that I'd have dedicated haters. I really appreciate you all and hope that it continues. I'd much rather you send that shit my way than to other people who might actually be negatively affected by that kind of trauma.

My favorite thing is that they claim my content has 0 analysis and that this is nothing but a personal diary. I agree with both of those facts. I've never claimed that I know anything about how the stock market works and I really don't believe that anyone that reads this actually considers this anything other than entertainment.

Current price: 150.98

**12:24 Update**

GME has grown $12, or 8.5% over the past hour. If this percentage growth continues GME could hit 170 by the end of the day.

That is only one of many possibilities. There is still a lot of market left that will alter that trajectory.

Current price: 152.80

**12:18 Update**

This is what I consider a retail bump. There is slow and steady growth as if millions of people are all making small trades over a large period of time. I expect this will continue as steady growth unless we see a sharp decline from a Short attack. 

Current price: 154.32

**11:55 Update**

Here comes lunch! Let's see if there's a run.

Current price: 146.12

**11:38 Update**

You know what makes Reddit really unique? This is the only platform where information is democratized. In every other medium, the content is decided by a single person. That person will most likely do what benefits them the most. Here on Reddit, everyone has the ability to do their own DD on a post and decide whether it's helpful or not. In no other medium can a random person's thoughts like mine be seen by literally millions of people.

I'm just a random dude that is posting what he sees. I do this for fun and to point out something that literally no other medium is expressing, that this system is absolutely fucked up. I'd be doing this with or without the upvotes, awards, or audience. It just happens that there are a lot of people who find my thoughts interesting enough for them to be seen.

Current price: 145.29

**11:26 Update**

Shorts available went up 20,000 before dropping down to 6,000.

Meanwhile lunch is coming up, and GME looks like it might start an upward climb. Today has been fascinating. Let's see if retail has something to say. Its going to be difficult for GME to hit the green, but I'm still not ruling out the realm of possibility.

Shorts available: 6,000

Current price: 146.15

**11:15 Update**

GME experienced another dip, but it still seems that there's a lot of resistance at 140. It'll be interesting to see if GME can break that.

I appreciate the love y'all. Those abusive shits don't bother me. If anything the fact that this exploded today was significant when it comes to understanding what is actually going on.

There is a large manipulation campaign going on. Look at places that claim to be the true WSB. Some of these places are starting to look and sound like a Wallstreet version of TD. What's the point of doing all of this unless you have a very vested interest in the destruction of a public corporation?

Current price: 143.59

**10:58 Update**

Volume has died since opening bell. I'm not entirely sure what to make of this. If there was a panic sell from retail, I feel like we would be seeing a more steady decline. Instead, we saw a sharp push down, followed by a small rebound, followed by a settling at around 147. I can't imagine that all of retail made up their minds in the first hour and all collectively agreed at 147. If there was more volume, I would have expected to see stronger volatility. If anything, it means that a lot of people still haven't made up their minds.

Current price: 145.04

**10:48 Update**

I feel comfortable enough to say that GME has settled at around 147. HFs are probably happy with this position. However they SHOULD be running out of shorts, so if there's a massive lunch push up, it'll be difficult for them to contain. We'll see how volume will stack up.

Shorts available: 8,000

Current price: 147.16

**10:30 Update**

The one thing I've noticed is the large amount of negativity and abuse against GME pointed directly at people.

I've never received so much negativity about my posts.

If you don't like it, why are you paying attention? If you don't care about the stock, why are you reaching out to me?

If someone is trying to establish some sort of superiority over you, they will probably gain an advantage by supressing you and your beliefs.

If this was a natural drop, nobody would be reaching out to me with such abuse. There are people who actively are trying to convince me to stop updating.

If you don't like the stock anymore, go do something more productive with your life than trying to shit on people having fun.

Current price: 149.86

283,RC," To combat some of the sensationalist articles highlighting the fact that Gamestop does have to ability to issue shares:

From [page 30 of Tuesday's 10-K filing](https://news.gamestop.com/node/18661/html), under 

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**


>Based on our current operating plans, we believe that available cash balances, cash generated from our operating activities and net availability under our revolving credit facility **will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our operations for the next 12 months as well as the foreseeable future.**


Yes, the company retains the option to make an ATM share offering, but they are plainly stating that as it stands right now they don't need to do so to raise capital to meet their plans.

********

Additionally, 8 current board members are now expected to leave as of the June Board Meeting.


[Buried in the 10-K that Gamestop released Tuesday, under ITEM 9B Other Information on page 39](https://news.gamestop.com/node/18661/html#i3ad65c8584a445ee94e4314f67ce616c_109) are additional upcoming changes to who will stand for reelection to the board in June:



>Reference is made to the Current Report on Form 8-K that we filed with the SEC on January 11, 2021 that disclosed that on January 10, 2021, we entered into an agreement (the ‚ÄúAgreement‚Äù) with RC Ventures LLC and Ryan Cohen. This Form 8-K also disclosed that, pursuant to the Agreement, we agreed that effective at our 2021 annual meeting of stockholders (the ‚Äú2021 Annual Meeting‚Äù), the size of the Board would be reduced from the current 13 directors to nine directors and that the Board would nominate for election the individuals identified in the Form 8-K for election as directors at the 2021 Annual Meeting. **As of the date of this Form 10-K, the Board has not determined the definitive slate of nominees but currently expects that the following incumbent directors will retire from the Board at the 2021 Annual Meeting: Lizabeth Dunn, Paul Evans, Raul J. Fernandez, Reginald Fils-Aim√©, William Simon, James K. Symancyk, Carrie W. Teffner and Kathy P. Vrabeck.** The contemplated retirements are not because of a disagreement with us on any matter relating to our operations, policies or practices.


This means that at the annual meeting, 8 of 10 incumbent directors are leaving. Someone else will have to weigh-on on how this impacts voting, because at that point the Cohen's team (Attal, Cohen, and Grube) outnumber the original directors left (Sherman and Wolf), and there will be 4 seats to fill to meet the new limit of 9.

396,JPM," I read everything you wrote but I think I'm missing something. Let me get this straight:

1. Retail buys all 127 million ounces of silver either physically or through PSLV (by May).
2. COMEX forces a buy from future ETFs (holding about 900 million ounces) because a recall on silver from a bunch of retails is impractical.
3. The price of PSLV breaks away from the rest of the (manipulated ETFs) because the COMEX is forcing them to sell.

Now wouldn't the 652 million ounces in the money become out of the money because the ETFs were required to sell to the COMEX? Also, wouldn't JPM most likely keep shorting positions on their ETFs as they control about 900 million ounces which is about 8 times the float of the COMEX?

452,AG," AG is fully leveraged to Silver prices and ready for lift off!!!  This is a short term play as well as a miner you want to own over the coming decade.  

\- Back of the napkin math indicates that AG holds at least 400,000 shares of PSLV - I've got an inquiry with Investor Relations to get an actual share count since AG isn't an institutional investor or mutual fund.  

\- AG just bought Jerritt Canyon gold mine in Nevada which will contribute at least 125,000 oz Au (approximately 8 million silver oz equivalent) on a pro forma basis.

\- Jerritt Canyon is historically undeveloped and just getting back to prior production will add hundreds of millions to AG's coffers.

\- AG entered into an ALL equity deal with Eric Sprott to buy Jerritt Canyon plus as a kicker Sprott reinvested another cool 30 million into AG.

\- AG owns 50% silver stream rights @ 1/3 spot price of the Springpole resource (being developed by First Mining Gold) which will yield about 20 million oz of silver beginning in a few years.  First Majestic gets half of that at a third of spot and capped at $7.50.  Let that sink in!

453,ALL," AG is fully leveraged to Silver prices and ready for lift off!!!  This is a short term play as well as a miner you want to own over the coming decade.  

\- Back of the napkin math indicates that AG holds at least 400,000 shares of PSLV - I've got an inquiry with Investor Relations to get an actual share count since AG isn't an institutional investor or mutual fund.  

\- AG just bought Jerritt Canyon gold mine in Nevada which will contribute at least 125,000 oz Au (approximately 8 million silver oz equivalent) on a pro forma basis.

\- Jerritt Canyon is historically undeveloped and just getting back to prior production will add hundreds of millions to AG's coffers.

\- AG entered into an ALL equity deal with Eric Sprott to buy Jerritt Canyon plus as a kicker Sprott reinvested another cool 30 million into AG.

\- AG owns 50% silver stream rights @ 1/3 spot price of the Springpole resource (being developed by First Mining Gold) which will yield about 20 million oz of silver beginning in a few years.  First Majestic gets half of that at a third of spot and capped at $7.50.  Let that sink in!

458,JP," tldr: $SLV is a scam

&#x200B;

Brief history, the silver market got cornered only twice in all of US history, the Hunt brothers in the '80s (jail time, assets seized by Feds, new laws enacted) and 2011 by gold/silver bugs who cashed out when it spiked. Institutions learned their lesson, JP Morgan bought up tons of silver to cash in on prospectors looking for a squeeze.

To the OP post, JP Morgan basically has the ultimate covered put position by owning an overwhelming amount of physical silver (long game) while massively shorting $SLV which is a silver ETF (short game) and are swing trading against retail investors on $SLV. Investors are only interested in $SLV price and buy/sell options contracts and their cash value instead of the actual physical silver they represent, so they buy $SLV/call options waiting for market volatility that'll never happen. JP Morgan takes the other side of trade and shorts $SLV, drive the price down and then buy more physical silver with the money they made. Who do they buy it from? $SLV, which drives the price up again. Investors think something is happening so they buy in again, JP Morgan shorts again, the cycle repeats. Retail investors don't understand Step 1 of silver short squeeze is to own physical silver and corner the market themselves which would mean get the physical silver out of JP Morgan permanently. If enough investors just exercise their contracts and demand exchange of $SLV for physical silver through a trustee of the ETF the silver squeeze could actually happen, not only because it breaks the game but also because it's not all that certain whether or not there's even enough silver to cover all the shares outstanding. And due to the physical nature of silver the squeeze would be massive and ongoing until it literally broke the bank. But because investors are only interested in cashing in on trade gains, JP Morgan is taking all their money through shorts. Only exception according to OP is $PSLV because the owner owns silver mines so his interest is to make silver skyrocket, but it can't happen until institutional ownership of silver goes down.",DogBearInuKuma,227,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mbx510/slv_is_a_complete_scam_its_a_scalp_trade_set_up/gs0z6sf/,0.029,0.873,0.098,0.9745

They can pay off several billions worth of almost 0% interest loans over the course of years. They know the game. What they are hoping for though is the banking system doesn't get sick of their shit and keep funneling them money to stave off the inevitable.

This would be a big no-no. Essentially, they‚Äôre now putting a price cap on this thing. They can justifiably sell shares to investors at any price below $175 (which they should and will, imo) because the investors are getting a deal versus the price target. GME can then sell stock and raise cash to fund the transition, but if you‚Äôre selling stock, it‚Äôs an admission by the company that the price is overpriced.

Feed disinformation to the media.  Draw out the play for months and months while the price drifts lower and people lose interest.

However if (and this is a big ""if"") it is an attempt to actually deflate dreams of ape walk on moon, then it's unlikely to have an effect. The GME apes are not buying GME to spite Kramer, the GME surge is because ape want banana-flavoured crayon and to surf green Shrek dildos.

I don't think they comprehend the level of retardation in play. Apes are buying GME calls at $800 instead of just going long. Apes are buying Gamestop stock instead of GME shares (yes, actually purchasing a playstation or xbox, a couple of controllers, and some used games).

So yeah, WSB does great work and has some awesome DD, but awesome DD does not necessarily mean retail is going to beat the big guys as a whole entity (some definitely will, many won't).",NOLAgold13,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mbpt6j/guys_these_people_are_saying_were_smart/gs0hcpw/,0.05,0.733,0.217,0.9759
690,DD," From the conclusion of the paper:
‚ÄúWallstreetbets (WSB) has become a household name after the intense media coverage following the Gamestop short sale squeeze and subsequent Congressional hearings seeking to determine its role in the event. Despite the conventional view that the platform primarily attracts uninformed investors, we find no systematic evidence of this. In fact, we find that due diligence reports ‚Äì reports that are vetted by moderators as pertaining some analysis ‚Äì contain investment value. Specifically, we find average ‚Äòbuy‚Äô recommendation are associated with over 1% two-day returns that continue to drift upwards, exceeding 6% over the quarter. However, the abnormal returns for the considerable smaller sample of sell recommendations, while generally negative, are not reliably different from zero.

Examining retail trading in short windows around DD report, we find a 7% increase in retail trading in the period immediately following the posting of the due diligence reports. Moreover, our results suggest that retail investors may be able to discern the quality of the reports, as we find that retail order imbalances become more correlated with future returns in the period immediately following the DD post. Thus, in stark contrast to regulators fears that WSB is ripe for market manipulation and harmful to retail investors, our results suggest that retail investors are likely to benefit from the recommendations on the site. Our analysis ends in 2020, which is before the Gamestop event in January 2021 that represented a huge shock to the site. Following our sample period, the site has experienced even more dramatic growth in the number of retail investors visiting the site, and the site is now attracting increased attention of commercial entities and hedge funds. How these changes impact both the content and value of the investment advice on WSB is an interesting and fruitful area for future research.‚Äù

Can there be a bigger win than that?",Fat_Pig_Reporting,30,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mbywu5/on_october_26_2008_porsche_announced_their_741/gs12jcl/,0.0,0.935,0.065,0.5859
836,GME," Porsche squeezed VW because they announced over 40% ownership of VW float, along with options to buy another 30+%, saxony had to hold 20%, and it left only 6% of float shares left open on the market, but the float was short 12%. The available shares were 1/2 of what was needed to cover shorts and the fraction of them left on the market made the squeeze was inevitable. Porsche was sure to exercise options, until their loans started getting called. Prior to Porsche‚Äôs cash issue, the deal was done and those 12% of shares owed by short sellers had to come from 6% of stock. 

We have never had information that GME had 200% of available shares shorted or that 94% of GME shares were locked. It‚Äôs both a short percent to available calculation and the tiny amount of volume issue that caused the squeeze. You need both to see it happen. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs impossible for GME to squeeze as hard with the numbers we have seen (to this point). Now, it could squeeze higher, but it‚Äôs not locked to oblivion by numbers like VW was.

The ATM shelf offering which is often cited in these arguments is for $100 million worth of common stock. With GME having ~$635 million in cash, one would imagine they would not preform this offering and lose out on a chance to finally shake out the current short selling rat infestation on their ship. 

Despite the current share price, GME is still only valued at ~$12 billion, which is half that of ‚Äúcomparable‚Äù companies like Best Buy. It would be silly to preform an unnecessary offering while still being undervalued.

Gme is NOT like any other stock in market history based on the last few months. It is absolutely worth the price that people are willing to pay for it and shorting the stock, driving the price down etc are all factors that have manipulated the price to what it is now.

967,RC," You're missing one very important change that happened yesterday.

[Buried in the 10-K that Gamestop released today, under ITEM 9B Other Information](https://news.gamestop.com/node/18661/html#i3ad65c8584a445ee94e4314f67ce616c_109) are additional upcoming changes to who will stand for reelection to the board in June:



>Reference is made to the Current Report on Form 8-K that we filed with the SEC on January 11, 2021 that disclosed that on January 10, 2021, we entered into an agreement (the ‚ÄúAgreement‚Äù) with RC Ventures LLC and Ryan Cohen. This Form 8-K also disclosed that, pursuant to the Agreement, we agreed that effective at our 2021 annual meeting of stockholders (the ‚Äú2021 Annual Meeting‚Äù), the size of the Board would be reduced from the current 13 directors to nine directors and that the Board would nominate for election the individuals identified in the Form 8-K for election as directors at the 2021 Annual Meeting. **As of the date of this Form 10-K, the Board has not determined the definitive slate of nominees but currently expects that the following incumbent directors will retire from the Board at the 2021 Annual Meeting: Lizabeth Dunn, Paul Evans, Raul J. Fernandez, Reginald Fils-Aim√©, William Simon, James K. Symancyk, Carrie W. Teffner and Kathy P. Vrabeck.** The contemplated retirements are not because of a disagreement with us on any matter relating to our operations, policies or practices.


This means that at the annual meeting, 8 of 10 incumbent directors are leaving. Someone else will have to weigh-on on how this impacts voting, because at that point the Cohen's team (Attal, Cohen, and Grube) outnumber the original directors left (Sherman and Wolf), and there will be 4 seats to fill to meet the new limit of 9.",YouAreAPyrate,460,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mc3o14/ryan_cohen_is_going_to_transform_gamestop_but_for/gs1f8ui/,0.011,0.933,0.056,0.8748

971,RC," Bullet point 5 needs some attention.

RC ventures retains the ability to recommend a ""Replacement Director"" if any ""New Director (or any Replacement Director)"" is unable or unwilling to serve. This means RC Ventures is able to protect their 3 seats by suggesting replacements to the Nominating Committee if any of their current seats (Ryan, Alan, Jim) don't seek reelection. This does not apply to any and every board member. It is specific to the New Directors, which are listed as Ryan Cohen, Alan Attal, and Jim Grube, and Replacement Directors (if needed).

983,RC," Because the CEO role can be filled by any top talent available across all industries, someone even better than RC could take the reigns of CEO and RC could just focus on what he is good at (digital transformation) for instance. The possibilities are endless.

There is certainly nothing wrong with George Sherman's strategy at this point. He has a good background in companies that were able to take dying business models and spring them back into life... including best buy and advanced auto parts. If it wasn't for the pandemic, gamestop was on the right track already.

984,GME," I don't know think we have a lot of information about the corporate culture of GME.  We do know there were 5 CEOs in just a few years.  We know that the company was being targeted for bankruptcy.  We also know that there was an expectation that the 3/15/21 debt would default (it has been paid off)

Prior to RC's announced stock ownership I don't think there was much effort to save the company. The CFO leaving so abruptly is a huge red flag imo. Also, sometimes people can be resentful about new ideas and resistant to change.  Newcomer, upstarts aren't always greeted as saviors.",Berningforchange,20,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mc3o14/ryan_cohen_is_going_to_transform_gamestop_but_for/gs2068o/,0.069,0.877,0.054,-0.1656

986,GME," Imo it doesn't matter at all.  It's not the company's fault that HFs tried to put it out of business by crazy shorting it. GME listed the possible short squeeze and volatile stock price in the 10K.  The company can keep on keepin' on, do the transformation and reap the benefit of all the free publicity.

All the craziness is driving traffic to the stores and creating a loyal base of customers. 

With regard to fundamental value...if GME becomes the go to online gaming place in addition to selling consoles, used games, etc... then $200 is not even close to the real value, it will be worth much, much more.",Berningforchange,9,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mc3o14/ryan_cohen_is_going_to_transform_gamestop_but_for/gs2h68o/,0.049,0.803,0.147,0.9018
987,CMO," Given Sherman‚Äôs 2 million shares ($400mm at $200) - I wonder if there‚Äôs a staredown going on related to a post employment lockup. 

The CMO shares were worth $44mm at $200 and his shares become unrestricted upon termination 

Cohen handed Sherm a multi hundred million dollar gift. I can‚Äôt imagine Sherm waits around to watch his net worth dwindle back to sh*t just to prove a point (?) ... unless something seriously f*cked is going on 

TLDR - he could be tied up in an exit package negotiation and is upset that Cohen is demanding he roll his equity",LittleDruck,27,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mc3o14/ryan_cohen_is_going_to_transform_gamestop_but_for/gs20vxy/,0.062,0.806,0.132,0.7269
988,GME," I only meant red flag in terms of what was happening before. GME was headed to bankruptcy and no one seemed interested in stopping it.

989,GME," Long and short term.

This Cohen stuff doesn't add up. The call was bizzare. I'll wait for call premiums to be slightly cheaper then slam them.

Why dilute at $170/share when you could dilute at $400? We've seen $400 already. Or why not at $1000?

In order for it to get to $1000, Cohen's vision needs to be expressed. You don't want to do the ATM for the current GME. You want to see the market's appetite for the Cohen GME.",Jeffamazon,41,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mc3o14/ryan_cohen_is_going_to_transform_gamestop_but_for/gs20a3z/,0.061,0.915,0.024,-0.2824
990,GME," Ya. I think the key to an ATM offering is that it can be sold in the open market during regular trading hours 

When Tesla did an ATM they basically issued a press release saying - ok - we just completed our ATM yesterday. And the market was none the wiser 

Point being ... look at the heavy disclosure in GME 10k around short selling. 

Company is keenly aware of what‚Äôs going on. 

Seems like they want to wait for a short squeeze and then sell at $500 or $1k or whatever. 

To me - sales at these prices would only be ‚Äúdilutive‚Äù in the sense that they increase the number of shares. But overall, an increased war chest would be accretive to the company with the right CEO and plan. 

I bet $GME wanted a $1B ATM but they upped it to $200mm to avoid scaring people. But the fact that they upped it, realizing the short term optics would make it look dilutive, tells me they want to max out that $200mm at a great price

992,GME," Here‚Äôs a thought I woke up with. 

Lots of attention on the short squeeze provisions in the filing. Obviously that is all CYA shit so they can mount a strong defense if it squeezes to 1000, for example, and some poor dumb ape here decides it‚Äôs GME‚Äôs fault it crashed back down to 100 or whatever and decides to sue. 

But this kind of provision would do equally well to insulate the company from liability if it squeezes again and they then issue the shelf at those levels to raise cash for the transformation. 

It seems like we could be entering the best possible period for that here now that Q4 is over. 

Recall that GME was reluctant to issue that shelf before during Squeeze I because of legal concerns about being in possession of non-public material info during the quiet period. Now that we‚Äôre outside that and we have that nice little short squeeze disclaimer to rely on, it seems like they are positioning GME to take maximum advantage of the squeeze+shelf while mitigating the risks associated from the blowback that would likely come from issuing that shelf at a level that everyone (and, importantly, even the new short squeeze provisions) acknowledges would be disconnected from fundamentals. Plus, it sure seems like this security could use a bit more liquidity given this volatility‚Äîso who could blame the company for issuing more shares to help provide that, right? 

That‚Äôs my rose colored glasses assessment of the situation at least. Think the next squeeze is inevitable given the fuckery and limited share availability here. And I also think the company wants to be prepared to capitalize on that this time. 

When it all goes down is the big question of course. But I‚Äôm betting RC wouldn‚Äôt mind for the SP to crater in the near term so he can buy up to 19.9% so those insider shares get called in and we launch off like last time. üöÄ",CPTHubbard,13,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mc3o14/ryan_cohen_is_going_to_transform_gamestop_but_for/gs2zevd/,0.063,0.807,0.13,0.9633

If you‚Äôre in GME for a short squeeze play, then short interest definitely does matter. The institutional ownership being 167% of float was a good indicator for a potential short squeeze back in December. 

That is no longer the case. Institutional ownership has definitely decreased as 1) GME had a small short squeeze already, and, 2) long-short hedge funds have laid off shorting stocks in general. That second point is why GME hasn‚Äôt been shorted on its way back down  to an extent as large as some people here are saying.  

Don‚Äôt believe me? Check NASDAQ‚Äôs record for institutional ownership. It is at 105%. Alternatively, check screencaps of the Bloomberg terminal that‚Äôs posts here regularly. It is going be to 100%-110%. It has been decreasing since Mid-Jan, and the next update will likely be even lower. 

Finally, it isn‚Äôt ‚Äú70% fake shares‚Äù. Shorted stock is not fake. Every short position creates a new long position, so total ownership of *any* stock that is shorted by even 1% will exceed float.

1093,GME," Let me explain something to you.

Institutional ownership is self reported.

Any time that any of these institutions make a small error or there is timing issues with the data, it could appear that institutional ownership is over 100%, when in reality it could be nowhere near that. If company A sells to company B and Company B reports their purchase before Company A reports their sale, ooops, you're double counting.

Any one who knows or follows the market will tell you not to use institutional ownership as a metric to evaluate a stock. If that is the basis of your investment in GME, you're in trouble.",flushotmonkey,9,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mcdj9n/gme_short_interest_doesnt_matter/gs3655r/,0.052,0.948,0.0,-0.6597

1337,LL," I built my gaming rig mostly with corsair products. Here are the products corsair is killing it in.

Power supply: look at any power supply tier list. Corsair is ranked in the top 5 with their rmx series.

Cpu cooler: h100 series is super popular choice for aio

Ram: some people hate or love the rbg design of corsair's ram, but the traditional non rgb ram are a solid choice for budget builds

Fans: corsair has a strong hold on the best rgb fans on the market, for now. LL fans came out 4 years and still popular. Everyone understands these fans come with a premium cost. If they can solve their wire mess like what lian li does then its a big game changer.

Keyboards: corsair rbg keyboards are a popular choice for beginners stepping into rgb. Other brands are going for light weight, wireless, and polling rates approach. 

Random thoughts: anyone trying to make an all white build knows corsair kills it in that category. People will pay $90 extra for the white version of the rmx power supply to only show a tiny but of white from a hole in the psu shroud.

I would personally mention more about their financials because they're quite good.

They have a really good balance sheet with very strong YoY and Quarterly growth and the total amount of liabilities are actually going down. They also still have more assets than liabilities even though they've just recently managed to turn a profit.

Do note that LOGI's PE is lower(\~19 vs \~30) but CRSR makes up for this with it's growth and Price/Sales ratios.

There are two types of share lending.  One is rehypothecation.  That's where they lend your shares to finance the loan that they give you.  It's standard in every margin agreement and you can't generally opt out.  If you don't like it, don't borrow their money to buy shares.  You get no compensation for it.

The other is fully paid lending.  That's where your fully paid shares are lent out.  That is completely optional.  Most brokers pay you some percentage of the interest they receive for lending your shares.  I'm opted in on both IBKR and Fidelity.  Fidelity pays you 60% of the interest they receive; IBKR pays you 50%.",Keith_13,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mc8t2b/margin_call_lmao_im_not_fucking_selling/gs3du11/,0.054,0.769,0.177,0.9441

1549,GME," It is uncommon for them to be unusually high, but we are seeing it now in GME, at some points the implied volatility was over 1000%

The idea of these squeezes is, if calls are bought someone has to hedge them, inducing buying. But if a lot are being bought, the people writing them can charge more and more for them, so making them buy the next share becomes more and more expensive. 

Further driving the GME one is that everyone is aware the price must come back down eventually, so you've got things like July puts priced as if its almost a certainty it'll be below $40 by then, and because of put-call parity, that makes the calls also priced incredibly high.

I saw something like this with Crox a long time ago, they were such a big fad the price of the stock was crazy high, and everyone knew it was going to fall, so put contracts were selling at crazy premiums, but that means the calls were too.

[Buried in the 10-K that Gamestop released Tuesday, under ITEM 9B Other Information on page 39](https://news.gamestop.com/node/18661/html#i3ad65c8584a445ee94e4314f67ce616c_109) are additional upcoming changes to who will stand for reelection to the board in June:



>Reference is made to the Current Report on Form 8-K that we filed with the SEC on January 11, 2021 that disclosed that on January 10, 2021, we entered into an agreement (the ‚ÄúAgreement‚Äù) with RC Ventures LLC and Ryan Cohen. This Form 8-K also disclosed that, pursuant to the Agreement, we agreed that effective at our 2021 annual meeting of stockholders (the ‚Äú2021 Annual Meeting‚Äù), the size of the Board would be reduced from the current 13 directors to nine directors and that the Board would nominate for election the individuals identified in the Form 8-K for election as directors at the 2021 Annual Meeting. **As of the date of this Form 10-K, the Board has not determined the definitive slate of nominees but currently expects that the following incumbent directors will retire from the Board at the 2021 Annual Meeting: Lizabeth Dunn, Paul Evans, Raul J. Fernandez, Reginald Fils-Aim√©, William Simon, James K. Symancyk, Carrie W. Teffner and Kathy P. Vrabeck.** The contemplated retirements are not because of a disagreement with us on any matter relating to our operations, policies or practices.


This means that at the annual meeting, 8 of 10 incumbent directors are leaving. Someone else will have to weigh-on on how this impacts voting, because at that point the Cohen's team (Attal, Cohen, and Grube) outnumber the original directors left (Sherman and Wolf), and there will be 4 seats to fill to meet the new limit of 9.",YouAreAPyrate,16,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mcesg4/most_of_gamestops_board_to_step_down/gs39mzp/,0.009,0.937,0.055,0.8967

I was in a similar state when I bought at 320 during the initial spike and it dropped to 50. I bought the dip, averaged down, and then sold on my way up to 260 making me leave at about even (my broker got confused with the math and isn‚Äôt sure how much I made or lost) I think I ended in the black.


Not saying you can or should do something similar. GME might not ever recover. Or maybe this is a momentary drop (I bought at 193 when it had been averaging at 250 and then dropped for like an hour for no reason.)

PLTR and BB are the two key players in this space right now. PLTR is heavily government focused and expanding to consumer world. 

Big data is already everywhere but is incredibly painful to mine for anything useful. The ability to mine for actionable information is critical to large companies wishing to stay competitive in the marketplace. 

RSI was around 30 this morning indicating this was oversold, as of about noon EDT it was in the mid 30s, still indicating a great buying opportunity. 

PLTR's last demo day popped the underlying to around $45, my planned exit point is $30 to $35 for the click day in April. 

I've decided that I want to put my kids into private school and need to pay off my truck to free up some money for that each month. Working more hours sucks worse than the Wendys dumpster, so I figured I'd YOLO what I could into PLTR and average down as required.

That said i think it will take ONE SINGLE PROFITABLE quarter just ONE and SP will run past the teens w no looking back (BB hasn't had one of those for a long long time tho - profitable quarter that is) 

Diamond Handing 5,500 @ 7.77 shares since 2014 (recently started selling CC's; thinking about CSP's for the ER thing)

PS - na gonna lie should've had a stop limit in place when it went to hi 20's and re-position about now; was so taken by the GME saga that kinda brushed the spike off thinking it will stay around a bit for me to make a decision...",greenday10Dsurfer,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mcba9j/bb_might_be_a_good_er_play/gs3i0md/,0.098,0.768,0.133,0.8728

1841,BB, I agree BB is good for a long time.  The foot in the door with automotive gives them a nice long term viability.,TechnicallyComputers,4,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mcba9j/bb_might_be_a_good_er_play/gs30834/,0.0,0.675,0.325,0.802
1842,FOR, Yeah did they give a reason why you should sell at this low price for a stock below fair market value or a reason other than - WATCH OUT FOR EARNINGS REPORT OH NO - as to why the market value us lower than the current stock price?  A logical reason for there not being long term growth potential?,TechnicallyComputers,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mcba9j/bb_might_be_a_good_er_play/gs30l4t/,0.116,0.695,0.189,0.5792
