3,ALL," So, while I sort of agree, it very very matters “what” tech you bought.

QQQ?  Yeah, it’ll probably be back, but it still is highly affected by interest rates.  Some of these other “boutique” ETFs like ICLN or ARK?  Individual mid/small cap companies? That remains to be seen.

Note to all investors, just because something is “the future” doesn’t mean it’s a good investment. It has to be executed well and provide value.  Not a stock market example, but Darien Scheme (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darien_scheme) is a perfect example of this.  

Basically, around 1700 Scotland wanted a colony like the other nations.  So they set together to fund a colony in Panama...after all exploration in the new world was obviously “the future” right?  How could it go wrong?  Up to 20% of all of Scotland’s wealth was invested in it.  You’ll have to read up on it, but it was an abject failure for many reasons, and the colony failed quickly.  This ended up being one of the reasons Scotland had to join England in the act of Union because they were destitute from wasting 1/5 of ALL their money on a boondoggle.

The younger ones, you and I, the under 50s, should be looking 15-20+ years ahead. This is why buying on discount is good. Also, why staying away from value stocks is a bad play, unless you like the company, then by all means, invest in your favourites. But, don’t rotate into value stocks just because the suits are saying so. There is no money to be made in those over the long term.

92,MSFT," MSFT Gamepass is an 18 million subscriber service costings $15 a month providing access to 100+ games (before Bethesda acquisition). Ongoing efforts with it include backwards compatibility and offering those games to current Gamepass subscribers and leveraging MSFT web services for the purpose of cloud based rendering / processing. What's more, there is no legitimate competition to the product MSFT is creating (others are either walled gardens available only  to existing customer base or, by design, limited in their offerings).

Gaming as a whole is a 3 billion player market (console, pc, and mobile) with expected growth in mature markets and larger growth in developing markets.

To those saying $250 per share is too expensive, how do you justify that evaluation based on comparison to Netflix ($500 per share)....a company that the Gamepass product is attempting to emulate.  Then add in MSFT is more highly diversified and pays dividends (ie all indicators of lower risk premium). 

I'm not saying MSFT shall go up, but when I asked myself (at $125 per share) why MSFT wasn't a $1000 per share company when so many others were, I just simply couldn't find a reasonable explanation.

Full disclosure, I own ~500 shares at ~125 per share cost basis so I am obviously biased, but many of the same arguments I'm hearing now (it's too expensive) were being used against MSFT when I bought that initial exposure. Since then they've only made good business decisions and experienced positives in almost every conceivable way.

101,GOOD," MSFT has seriously destroyed some beloved game franchises in the past.   


Freelancer comes to mind as a personal irritation along with many other games (many years ago).   


However, that was some time ago and MSFT has a totally new attitude towards game development due to their GAMEPASS push.

141,GM," Think of the old phone manufacturers Nokia, Motorola, etc, the largest brick and mortar book stores, photo film manufacturers, Blockbuster, Toys R Us, even GM. Remember that GM already went bankrupt once and tax payers bailed them out.

They all saw the rise of their competitors from a mile away and just watched.

Large, old companies have a hard time changing course. How many of them are making an honest effort to make a complete switch to EV. How many are going to actually be good at it. Many countries already plan to ban ICE cars by 2035.

My point is that you can't assume all the legacy autos will continue to grow. Going EV and even more difficult, going self driving isn't as easy as flicking a switch. It's a completely different mindset.

When they transition, their EV cars will cannibalize the profits of their ICE cars. They'll have to make sweeping change from the ground up to make these cars as cheap as Tesla can.

142,ICE," Think of the old phone manufacturers Nokia, Motorola, etc, the largest brick and mortar book stores, photo film manufacturers, Blockbuster, Toys R Us, even GM. Remember that GM already went bankrupt once and tax payers bailed them out.

143,TSLA," I agree with most of your sentiment, and I can envision a future where a company like TSLA will leave its competitors in the dust in, say, 15 years (near that 2035 target you mention). But even so, I'm far from **confident** in that idea, so to invest on that alone is quite risky. What would justify investment in that case is the potential for sufficiently large capital gains that make up for the large risk. But TSLA is already worth 3 Toyotas on the market, and I figure that in 15 years that could well be justified. But how much bigger could TSLA possibly get if it's already 3x as big as Toyota in market value? Could it reasonably grow enough to be another 3x larger in 5 years? And even bigger in 2035? How many people are even going to **need** a TSLA vehicle in 2035? What if a sexier competitor arisea either in an existing prospect like VW or a newcomer? 15 years is a long time, and I just don't see TSLA as a worthwhile **investment** right now (speculating is a totally different story, though; you could well make good $ in the short term if you're lucky).",Peshhhh,2,/r/stocks/comments/mdorgy/remember_it_doesnt_matter_how_much_a_stock_goes/gsbxwtz/,0.036,0.822,0.142,0.9646
144,TSLA," I'm not arguing TSLA valuation because I'm not that knowledgeable in that regard.

But I'll add. Toyota is a car manufacturer, yes they do make other machines, but those are not for the mass market. Tesla is in more spaces than that. Solar, battery, and charging, the big ticket item will hopefully be robo taxis ~~if~~ when that comes to fruition, semi trucks. I can't imagine what else they can bring to market, but do you think they are done innovating?

Amazon isn't just a book store, Google isn't just a search engine. Tesla won't just stop at making cars, but even if they only made cars, self driving cars would be the biggest innovation in our lifetime. They can always license that technology.

157,PT," The drug is 100% dependent upon top line results coming out within 5 days.  The recent studies out of the UK (among others) showing the role of GM-CSF in severe covid-19 patients reinforces the science behind Lenzilumab targeting GM-CSF.  Current mRNA vaccines are helping tremendously BUT there is a significant portion of the population who refuse to take them, it's a big world (look at Brazil) and there are variants that we don't yet fully understand how the vaccines will handle them.  There will be at minimum a multi-year demand for this drug if effective.  That doesn't include DOD stockpiling.  That's plenty of time for the Car-T trials, and others, the company is running to complete.

Other drugs available to help suppress the cytokine storm are mostly ineffective.  Ask the doctors watching patients die every day.  Remdesivir, Dexamethosone, Tocilizumab offer help to some patients but not the most sick.  The other approved MAB's are not approved for hospitalized patients that are hypoxic.  There is a void in SOC that Lenzilumab can fill.

The drug was selected by the NIH to be part of the ACTIV 5/BET trial that continues to add sites to the study.  They chose Lenz out of 100's of drugs to compare to Remdesivir.  These studies shut down quickly if they are not showing positive results.  You can verify this looking at the other ACTIV trials.

The data from the trial is being shared directly with the DOD even though the company has not seen them.  The DOD, through BARDA, has assigned fill/finish capacity to Humanigen.  That is one of their greatest resources.  They can throw money at anything but actual resources are limited.

Through CRADA (Cooperative Research And Development Agreement) they had Janet Woodcock working on behalf of the company with the FDA to make sure all their ducks are in a row.  They are currently meeting with OWS on a weekly basis on CMC's (Control, Manufacturing and Controls).

The market will just shift. Private placements will still occur outside of IPOs to secure great share prices, that they can then still sell at IPO open.

183,RIG," Haha, until it drops another 50%.  Of course then you can't possibly lose money,  until it drops another 50%.  

I made my mistake early with RIG.  Bought at $2k worth at $75, had paper gains when it was $100, then Deepwater Horizon.   Figured RIG liability wasn't much (BP was), and I was right, it went back to $80, then started going down and just didn't stop.   I got out at $5.  And yes,  it kept going down to $1 before tripling all the way up to $3.  My mistake was not understanding fracking (thought it was all about the natural gas).

Good luck not losing anything by holding.   I hope you never end up in a situation where you're wrong like I did.",bernie638,0,/r/stocks/comments/mdcpjo/psa_its_okay_to_sell_at_a_loss/gs9zgue/,0.099,0.691,0.21,0.9321

197,DD," You can make inferences based off of things that happen. For example, if a stock says that they are going to do an offering on X date of 5,000,000 shares, you can expect the price to go down. There are certain things that happen to the market that guarantee something going down. 

Another example, say Biden goes out of his way and says that he's looking into enforcing Marijuana regulations more strictly, what do you think is going to happen to a lot of the pot stocks?

Its not impossible to predict things happening to a stock, its just something that you have to do a fair amount of DD on to make sure you are appropriately weighting the factors effecting it. Somethings serve as greater catalysts than others.

As far as predicting GME, I've been fairly reliable just following the volume. Whenever the volume starts dipping, that's when you suddenly see it drop rapidly in price. Volume starts picking up again, stock goes up. This is largely due to what actually is the reason that GME is priced what it currently is. 

Something similar can be done with domestic oil atm. As soon as I saw the Suez was blocked, I knew that domestic oil producers would get a boon off of this for short term, since the Suez is a major oil shipping highway.

The stocks that are pure speculation, if you want to compare those to dot com, it’s much more appropriate. And those are getting destroyed. even companies that aren’t “vaporware” and actually have strong products, just with speculation baked in, like PLTR, are down like 30% or more. Pure speculation hit even worse. Measure the growth of SPACs beyond NAV and tons of those have lost 90% of their speculation based value 

So no, let’s not pretend the entire nasdaq is going to dot com, that just wouldn’t make any sense. Imagine apple crashing back to $30, yea right. Not gonna happen.

350,SO," > Saving up 150k on a 45k salary isn’t something that started last year during the pandemic.

He invested during one of the biggest bull runs of 2020 and lives at home though(High SR+Record returns is a perfect storm for wealth building) so it's honestly very possible depending on what he invested in.

EDIT: Also want to point out that even if we assume he's been doing this for years since he lives at home a higher SR is not at all abnormal in fact it would be pretty dumb to save the avg 7-15% while living at home. May as well take advantage of 0-low living costs while you can. I was saving about 50% at my first decent job I got at home pre pandemic and living pretty well and experiencing loads only spending 9kish per year including multiple trips to San Fran, a party or two and trips to a few inexpensive but fun festivals.

I'm 24 and am in the same boat as OP, made 40k last year and boosted my savings to 23k from like 5k. I didn't invest much in the market outside of indexes till EOY but had I invest I easily could have been sitting on 100k+. I have a higher salary now at 60-70k and am currently sitting at 40k only months later and given my savings rates and investment returns this year I have good shots at hitting 100k by EOY, or at least being very close to it.

>OP saying his SO left him because he sounds like he’s actually addicted to his savings/ investing for retirement.

More specifically because she wanted to *buy a house* with his net worth being at 150k and only making 40k/year salary.

That would have gutted him depending on where he lives and there's high odds he wouldn't be able to afford the mortgage in 2-3 years. They would probably be living hand-to-mouth best case for a while. Even without being addicted to savings there's **A LOT** of reasons why this  would have been a bad idea. Not to mention, she went out and literally cheated on him due to this decision instead of being an actual adult and discussing the issues so I don't see a lot of downside to OP's decision making right now. Seems like he lost a shitty person who would have been a terrible person to try and have a long lasting relationship with which is a net positive in my eyes.",Nafemp,1,/r/stocks/comments/mdp8k9/has_stockinvesting_addictions_interfered_with/gsbtrjn/,0.058,0.806,0.136,0.9823

352,IMO," I mean I'm not contending that he may have an addiction and he openly admits he has relational issues(Although given the nature of last year I think we need to know more before deciding he has an addiction. **EVERYONE'S** savings rates went through the roof through the pandemic and there were loads of explosive returns on investment).

Just contending that if there's any time to save a shit ton of money it's now. You're not exactly missing out on a lot by hunkering down and saving 50-75% if you have the ability to do it. Not a lot to go out and do right now.

Also putting out there but that chick wasn't a peach either and OP is better off without her. Chick wanted him to gut his savings for a house when his income definitely wasn't there to support it long term(Depending on his COL area though of course), and then turned around and cheated on him after he said no instead of discussing the issues or just making a clean break. IMO he's way better off without her and she seems like an immature asshole. Should sort out his issues and find someone better.",Nafemp,2,/r/stocks/comments/mdp8k9/has_stockinvesting_addictions_interfered_with/gsbulw4/,0.058,0.81,0.133,0.9355
353,IMO," I do want to say I don’t condone what his SO did. She really should have been an adult and communicated with him that things got that bad. OP is better off without someone who is willing to cheat. I haven’t read the thread and don’t know all the details of the home buying but I had assumed he would contribute some of the down payment and that the mortgage is something that he would be able to sustain at 45k a year wherever he was living. If he was expected to contribute more because of his 150k savings, then that is a problem.    
Sorry if my last post seemed combative, it was not my intention. You are correct that he could have saved that money up much faster than I had assumed. I was thinking that they had been dating for some time if they were discussing purchasing a home together. I assumed that he had been more preoccupied with savings/investing than the relationship for a few years at least.   
OP seems clearly upset and even said that he is addicted to stocks and investing. There is a much healthier middle ground where he can save for his future and still enjoy the money he earns.

392,USA, Many people aren't aware of it but it's a huge risk of every Chinese stock. The Chinese gov makes it illegal for any foreigners to own stocks in Chinese companies. I won't go into why but it's so that the gov has stronger power over their companies. These companies have created a loophole by creating shell companies in the Cayman Islands called VIEs that get around this. So any Chinese stock you own is a promise that the shell company is going to pay you based on what the actual Chinese company earns. China has allowed this to continue because it gets a lot of western money into China. But if China decides that they want to close the loophole for any reason then you will be bag holding to a company on paper that doesn't actually exist.

399,AMC," Thanks for linking this. Does AppHarvest discuss the strategy on how they plan to successfully grow their business to $467M run rate?

For example, BYND has three go to market strategies:

1. Direct consumer sales - They continue to expand how many stores will carry BYND product

2. Restaurant/FastFood relationships - They recently partnered with McDonalds to offer a green veggie based food line. https://investors.beyondmeat.com/news-releases/news-release-details/beyond-meatr-announces-strategic-global-agreement-mcdonalds

3. Consumer Staples partnerships - They have announced a partnership with Pepsico to offer plant based protein snacks (ie. Frito Lay chips?): https://www.beyondmeat.com/whats-new/beyond-meat-and-pepsico-establish-and-introduce-the-planet-partnership/

I haven't dug into Appharvest, but I agree that AgTech is going to be interesting in the next 10 years. Chris Hadfield was interviewing James Cameron back in November 2020 and James Cameron said that he's focusing his attention on AgTech and technology to solve food insecurity. He said that there is so much mindshare in the EV/cleanpower space that he instead is directing his attention to a space that doesn't have so many eyes on it yet: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYOgs1VO7dA

(Its a long interview but enjoyable)

Also, why is APPH being shorted?

Most stocks have a political or macro reason to be shorted. TSLA was shorted for political reasons, as HF's that were loyal to traditional energy (ie. coal, oil/gas) had vested interests to see TSLA falter. GME was shorted because it was seen as a dying legacy business model in a digital industry. AMC was shorted for similar reasons, as more movies shift from theatres to direct-at-home.

Whats the logical behind APPH is being shorted?

BYND is volatile as the plant base protein space has two head winds:

1. Meat is still seen as a luxury good. And as incomes rise around the world, eating meat becomes a status symbol of wealth. This has been evidenced by the BRIC nations seeing higher meat consumption. Plant based proteins are good for the world as an aggregate, but most people are still concerned about the status symbol that meat provides.

2. Price and economies of scale. Its still cheaper to raise meat in many ways. 


Moreover, just perusing through AppHarvests' website: https://www.appharvest.com/

It looks like they're not focused on the actual go-to-market workflow that BYND is focusing on. They seem more focused on the actual growing. So I don't think this is an apples-to-apples comparison? Why are you comparing BYND to APPH? They don't seem too close to each other in market segment or industry.",radarbot,4,/r/stocks/comments/mdedab/127_per_share_rough_estimate_for_appharvest_in/gsa3et2/,0.022,0.873,0.105,0.986

I haven't dug into Appharvest, but I agree that AgTech is going to be interesting in the next 10 years. Chris Hadfield was interviewing James Cameron back in November 2020 and James Cameron said that he's focusing his attention on AgTech and technology to solve food insecurity. He said that there is so much mindshare in the EV/cleanpower space that he instead is directing his attention to a space that doesn't have so many eyes on it yet: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYOgs1VO7dA

(Its a long interview but enjoyable)

Also, why is APPH being shorted?

Most stocks have a political or macro reason to be shorted. TSLA was shorted for political reasons, as HF's that were loyal to traditional energy (ie. coal, oil/gas) had vested interests to see TSLA falter. GME was shorted because it was seen as a dying legacy business model in a digital industry. AMC was shorted for similar reasons, as more movies shift from theatres to direct-at-home.

Whats the logical behind APPH is being shorted?

BYND is volatile as the plant base protein space has two head winds:

1. Meat is still seen as a luxury good. And as incomes rise around the world, eating meat becomes a status symbol of wealth. This has been evidenced by the BRIC nations seeing higher meat consumption. Plant based proteins are good for the world as an aggregate, but most people are still concerned about the status symbol that meat provides.

2. Price and economies of scale. Its still cheaper to raise meat in many ways. 


Moreover, just perusing through AppHarvests' website: https://www.appharvest.com/

It looks like they're not focused on the actual go-to-market workflow that BYND is focusing on. They seem more focused on the actual growing. So I don't think this is an apples-to-apples comparison?

After reading this I of course invested my life’s savings (20+ years of working) at around $200, but it seems to have dropped to $170 since. I know it’s just a short ladder attack but as a noob it’s kind of scary seeing everything drop 15% just like that. When exactly will the prices hit $1,000 like everyone is saying?

432,GME," What I find funny about the memes coming from WSB and /r/GME is this idea that hedge funds exist only to short companies and bilk retail investors. While those are both things that I'm sure hedge funds do, what hedge funds mainly do is try to make money... which to me would indicate that sometimes they do in fact want the stonks to go up.

And of course, the idea that no other hedge funds are playing either side of the GME game is also silly. Like they are literally called hedge funds, of course they're going to hedge their bets!

And thirdly, if you think that the majority of retail has the tools and wherewithal to get out before hedge funds when the crash comes  (and a crash will come eventually, whether next hour, next month or next year), I think you're sorely mistaken.

(By the way, I'm not shit-talking GME investors, I made decent profit on the first run-up and if I hadn't pissed it all away trying to learn options I'd probably go for another ride. It's just the cult-like certainty and outright propaganda of some WSB folks that makes me worry that some people are going to get fucked.)",kultcher,9,/r/stocks/comments/mdkpjm/rstocks_daily_thread_on_meme_stocks_friday_mar_26/gsapuxp/,0.069,0.838,0.094,0.5362

They are suppose to have amazing brand recognition in China too and their product is everywhere ( they licences the brand, I'm sure they can get better license deals in the future). Your not buying a magazine, but a highly recognizable brand in search of a product ( CBD, sex toys, lingerie, condoms, beauty supplies, themed casinos, branded clothing, etc.)  I think their brand recognition will give them a high return on equity.  Their CEO is the former CFO of match group (think tinder)  and so he should be able to use the brand image well.  I could see this doubling in a year and being a potential 10 bagger in 5.

519,NIO," I've been accumulating Ford for a while myself, and made decent returns on them, through selling CCs and watching the price rise over the past year ... so I may be a bit biased on Ford's EV play.

Until COVID hit, they've been buying back stock at a fairly consistent rate of ~100M a year, and had been paying a $0.15 dividend (also until COVID).  I don't miss the dividend much, and am actually hoping they don't turn it back on, instead using it to reduce their debt and continue buying back shares.  I'd rather see the bump in LTCG from stock buyback, than a qualified dividend myself.  I like Ford's EV play, and think that they are the best position to capitalize on an emerging truck EV market (F series are the best selling vehicles in the US).

The EV play for Ford is not a sure thing, by any stretch of the imagination. Ford's debt is quite large, but their current ratio is 1.2, so it's not like they're drowning either.

NIO has the manufacturing, sales/financing, NIO Service, NIO Power, NIO Life, NIO AI and they're aggressively working on autonomous driving. This company offers these all as a monthly service which shows more revenue opportunity in a country that is aggressively phasing out ICE vehicles. The NIO Power is not just the battery swap stations but includes chargers, power home and mobile charging station. During my initial research they looked like a EV parts manufacturer to me since they have their own battery, power train and motor factories. Soon they'll have their own car manufacturing facility. This doesn't include the partnerships that NIO has with VW and SINOPEC. Also, NIO and XPENG have both been dropping hints about a partnership, which combined would make them the top dog in China.",CHEZ75,1,/r/stocks/comments/mdt1eq/nio_vs_f_why_is_nio_more_hyped_than_f/gsc4xnw/,0.046,0.866,0.088,0.8475

Step 1: get sleep

Step 2: get more sleep

Step 3: did you get enough sleep?

Step 4: make sure you're getting enough sleep

Sleep has a tremendous role in emotional regulation, which is essential for any experienced trader.  I've been on a winning streak since November, make 3-5% every week until the week ending on 3/12. I actually made considerable money on the way down due to my strategies. BUT on the week ending of 3/12, I yolo'ed some GME 800c 3/12 and SPY 395c 3/12 and lost over a grand, and got myself flagged as a PDT and now one of my accounts is locked until June lmao. 

It's like being drunk on fun and then having an abrupt stop to the party. It's important to cool off sometimes if you notice yourself going off the rails. Take breaks, plan your trades, don't overtrade or over manage. Set price targets and make exit plans. 

I'm going to say that you're not experienced enough yet since you said January, and I'm going to assume 2021. So I'd start with learning to manage position sizes, set up some plans and rules to keep yourself in check. 

&#x200B;

1. NEVER yolo more than 3-5% of your account on any one trade. If you go over that, you'll blow up your trading account and it'll suck. Luckily the GME and SPY loss was within my personal risk tolerances
2. Trade with a plan, set price targets, stop losses, exit plans for profit-taking, and so on. This gets really tricky, but I use technical analysis for this. People say it's horse shit, and I agree. I've left lots of profits on the table, or sold for a loss only to have the underlying go up shortly after. Find your own plan that works for you, nothing is perfect. If it's a crystal ball that works, it works. Why do I still use it? It has made me more gains than losses consistently. 
3. Have confidence in your trades, plans, and investments. Don't over-manage your trades, looking at the screen 24/7. This one just requires experience and an overall feel of the market. For example, if you're selling calls on tech stocks, and you see tech stocks doing bad, you could be more aggressive with the calls you sell. Conversely, I wouldn't be buying calls or selling puts. I would short tech, etc. Commodities, bonds, etcccc. Confidence comes from DD and research, fundamentals and sentiment. 
4. Diversify your portfolio and trades. Have hedges in place. Don't put all your eggs in a meme or tech basket. 
5. Set personal limits. On a losing streak? stop trading for a few days to cool off. Maybe stop trading after 3-5 consecutive losses or something. 
6. Learn about the fallacies of sunk cost, anchoring, and so on. Sometimes it's better to eat the loss and move on for better opportunities. This especially applies to options, since the greeks mostly work against you. 
7. Options and greeks are a whole nother can of monsters. 

But, as a long term investor for over a decade, I'm sure you know your way around stocks and the market. Just take the time and patience to learn and become disciplined. If not, it's okay if trading is not for you. Honestly buy and hold combined with DCA usually wins in the long run. Most traders are not profitable. Also its a lot of time and stress to trade actively lol.

536,AAPL," I 100% feel you on this. I had a very similar experience. I slowly grew my account over 6 months for 60% gains. Then all the gains were wiped out in 3 weeks. Easy come, easy go.

The biggest and most important thing I keep telling myself: its just money.

The first step of being emotionally detached from your investments is creating an aggregate networth and budgeting plan. A few key questions I use for myself:

* How much money do I have in the market via equities?

* How much money do I make from other income sources?

* If my equities go to zero and don't recover (ie. global catastrophic financial meltdown), how long will it take to get me back to where I am today?

* If my equities see an 80% drawdown (ie. 2001 dotcom, 2008 financial crisis), how long before I can get back to where I am using all income sources?

Creating budgeting strategies lets me sleep better at night. Because if I have a 60% drawdown in my trading portfolio, I know my net worth will only draw down by about 20% because of my aggregate financial asset allocation. And a 20% drawdown in net worth doesn't seem as scary as a 60% drawdown in net worth.

After you've done that, you need to create a manifesto. You need to write down why you're trading. All the existential reasons:

* What is your end goal of trading?

* When will you stop trading?

* How much money is considered ""life changing"" so you have financial independence?

Once you've created your manifesto, now write down your trading strategy and start keeping a log. Restrict yourself aggressively if you know you have weak determination (I do...so I have to be very strict with myself). Here are some trading strategies to get started:

* How many total stocks do you want to own? When I first started out, I didn't want to own more than 10. But I realized that even that was too much, so I pared that back to 5 to get my bearings. Over time I slowly grew that to 10 total stocks. If I ever want to buy a new stock, I force myself to drop an existing stock and make a justified reason as to why I'm buying a new ticker and replacing an existing ticker.

* What is the reason you bought the stock? Is this a momentum trade? If yes, what is your entry/exit points. WRITE IT DOWN. Force yourself to exit when you have written down the entry/exits. Don't try to squeeze every extra dollar. Don't worry if you missed a second pump. Don't hold garbage that tanks after bad news. Is this a conviction trade? Then buy and hold. And when you make more money, buy more. Companies like AAPL, MSFT, AMZN are all conviction trades. You buy and keep accumulating because you have faith they'll keep growing. And there are more volatile conviction trades. I'm a big believer in NET, I think they're putting out amazing products and will 3x in the next 5 years. I'm continuing to add to my position in NET whenever there is a drawdown. I consider NET currently trading at < $70 to be a steal if I zoom out and look at 5 year time horizons. Some people feel the same way about IPOE (SOFI), others about ABNB, and I think TSLA was the biggest conviction trade historically.

* What is your tax implication? When you sell, you have to pay the tax man. How will you store all your proceeds, carve out tax burden and reinvest your earnings?

* How do you handle macro market events? Do you set stop losses? Do you keep extra kindling to buy into dips? Do you just set and forget? You need a strategy that lets you sleep at night. Also, what about the opposite? If you bought a stock and it hits your price target well ahead of schedule. What do you do then? Do you pare back your investment? Do you double down? You need to understand these impacts so you can properly balance your money.

What works for me is writing things down and going back and reading them once a week before I do anything to my portfolio. Without writing things down, you won't commit to a strategy. And write them down on paper. There is a social psychological impact of writing down your convictions with a pen on paper. It reinforces it stronger into your brain and holds you more accountable.",radarbot,1,/r/stocks/comments/mdekqi/what_are_your_best_strategies_to_avoiding/gsa5dzw/,0.051,0.862,0.087,0.9697

540,MSFT," I 100% feel you on this. I had a very similar experience. I slowly grew my account over 6 months for 60% gains. Then all the gains were wiped out in 3 weeks. Easy come, easy go.

The biggest and most important thing I keep telling myself: its just money.

The first step of being emotionally detached from your investments is creating an aggregate networth and budgeting plan. A few key questions I use for myself:

* How much money do I have in the market via equities?

* How much money do I make from other income sources?

* If my equities go to zero and don't recover (ie. global catastrophic financial meltdown), how long will it take to get me back to where I am today?

* If my equities see an 80% drawdown (ie. 2001 dotcom, 2008 financial crisis), how long before I can get back to where I am using all income sources?

Creating budgeting strategies lets me sleep better at night. Because if I have a 60% drawdown in my trading portfolio, I know my net worth will only draw down by about 20% because of my aggregate financial asset allocation. And a 20% drawdown in net worth doesn't seem as scary as a 60% drawdown in net worth.

After you've done that, you need to create a manifesto. You need to write down why you're trading. All the existential reasons:

* What is your end goal of trading?

* When will you stop trading?

* How much money is considered ""life changing"" so you have financial independence?

Once you've created your manifesto, now write down your trading strategy and start keeping a log. Restrict yourself aggressively if you know you have weak determination (I do...so I have to be very strict with myself). Here are some trading strategies to get started:

* How many total stocks do you want to own? When I first started out, I didn't want to own more than 10. But I realized that even that was too much, so I pared that back to 5 to get my bearings. Over time I slowly grew that to 10 total stocks. If I ever want to buy a new stock, I force myself to drop an existing stock and make a justified reason as to why I'm buying a new ticker and replacing an existing ticker.

* What is the reason you bought the stock? Is this a momentum trade? If yes, what is your entry/exit points. WRITE IT DOWN. Force yourself to exit when you have written down the entry/exits. Don't try to squeeze every extra dollar. Don't worry if you missed a second pump. Don't hold garbage that tanks after bad news. Is this a conviction trade? Then buy and hold. And when you make more money, buy more. Companies like AAPL, MSFT, AMZN are all conviction trades. You buy and keep accumulating because you have faith they'll keep growing.

IMO, in about two hours from reading and looking at balance sheet, you can already know if it is worth continuing your investigation in a company. You have enough time to look at the product they offer, their plan for the future, their history, profitability, future expectations, etc.

560,DD," 500-1k hours?! No. 

Even at net $4/hour that would be $4000 of time invested. That much research isn't really useful in the skill-building sense, and I like my do-nothing time more than that. Also, am I actually adding $4k of gains by doing that? Surely it will lead to either a yes or a no - and a no means doing another 1k hours on a different company. 

So: nowhere near. There's people whose job it is to do that. They're called analysts, and they actually get directly paid for it. For a stock I like and want to take up a proper position in, I will read the news and opinion pieces on a stock, look at its price history and maybe P/E history, look at analysts opinions and forecasts and the sort of stats/info you get on Yahoo finance (including recent earnings and forecast next one). That doesn't take long. Not more than an hour at a good reading speed. Will keep an eye on the news feed for stocks in my portfolio, but not read every item - mainly skim the headlines. Keep in mind these are solid companies though, not diversifying into weed, and I probably thought about buying that stock in the first place after reading general market news.

For a YOLO sort of play, I am normally pretty low conviction, only a small bet on it, etc. Not much research, not much conviction in it's stability/upwards motion, not much money. But that's gambles.

575,ATH," Yes.  Financials are positioned well to be market leaders after underperforming for so long.  The Fed will start lifting restrictions on things like buybacks and dividend increases, and rising interest rates is great for financials.

Here's a secret: you will make more money over the long run investing in stocks at their ATHs than you will trying to find ones trading in the lower part of their historical ranges.  A stock trading at its ATH is a sign of strength.  The only time it becomes a problem is if the valuation has gotten way out of hand, which is what we saw with tech.

But if the GME cartel pipe dream comes true (again it won't because this cartel has zero enforcement mechanism), and they succeed in ever driving the price upward with zero sensitivity to fundamentals, then there is no reason NOT to issue new shares.

Why not pay huge bonuses and offer lush comp packages to new hires or really build out new divisions?  Plus unwinding at least a portion of their physical presence (which average a lease term of about 2-3 years) is going to cost money.

Some institutional holders are fine issuing new capital.  Some are holders due to other existing relationships with their Ibanking arm or some other reason.

623,DKNG," You purchased a long call with a strike price of $67 for a debit of $188 = 1.88x100 and an expiration of April 1st. The maximum risk here is the debit you provided, $188, and the maximum return is theoretically infinite. The ~$600 max profit was being calculated for a given range, likely at expiration. The breakeven for your option at expiration is 67+1.88 = $68.88. Therefore, at expiration on April 1st if DKNG is at exactly $68.88 then you will make $0 (minus any transaction fees you incurred). If it closes under $67 then you will lose the entire premium you debited ($188) and if it closes above the breakeven then you would profit whatever the difference is between that closing price and your breakeven. (e.g. It closes at $71 on April 1st and you make 71-68.88 = 2.12x100 = $212). 

If you do nothing at all, your broker, or the Option Clearing Corporation (OCC) on your behalf, will automatically exercise an option that is ITM by at least $0.01 (e.g. DKNG at $67.01 or greater) and you will receive a credit in your account for the profit. All of this only considers the intrinsic value of the option at expiration.

You can also sell the option prior to expiration and it may have some additional value (extrinsic value) in addition to any intrinsic value it has. For example, if DKNG hits $70 tomorrow, and assuming constant implied volatility, then the value of your option might rise to $370, which is greater than just the 70-68.88=$112 you would earn if this took place on April 1st at expiration. However, this extrinsic value decays over time as you approach your expiration date due to theta decay until only intrinsic value is left at expiration.

For what it's worth, it wasn't a terrible long call to buy and I think you stand a good chance of making some kind of profit here, although who knows especially in this market lately. I suggest setting a profit goal, at which point you should sell-to-close your option. E.g. If it hits 50% profit at any point between now and April 1st you sell the option and lock in your gain. Also, I would suggest reading some more stuff online before spending more money on options. This type of out-of-the-money (OTM) call purchase with a weekly expiration is highly unlikely to succeed if repeated over time.",ExistentialDecisions,7,/r/stocks/comments/md8gnc/dkng_weekly_call/gs83ov2/,0.028,0.847,0.125,0.9894
624,DKNG," 1 call contract = you have the *right, but not the obligation* to buy 100 shares of a stock at the designated strike price x 100 until the designated date.

So, since you own an April 1st call at a strike price of $67, you have until April 1st the *right, but not the obligation* to buy 100 shares of DKNG for $67 each, so a total of $6700. This is regardless of the market price for DKNG. So, DKNG can hit $100 per share, and you'd still have the right to buy it for $67 per share.

This is how, in theory, you make money as a call buyer - the stock rises above your ""break even"" on the market, at which time you can buy the stock for the lower strike price you set, and then sell it on the market for profit.

Now, most options buyers won't be actually exercising their option. Instead, they'll be selling the option contract itself for a profit, once the underlying stock rises above the break even. This works just like a stock - your contract will rise in value as DKNG rises in price, and at some stage, you'll be able to sell it for more than you bought it for, at which stage you can decide to Sell to Close the contract and realize your gain.

But be careful - you only have until April 1st to sell or exercise the contract, after which it expires useless. Each day that passes where DKNG doesn't rise above $67, your option's value decreases. So most people will sell at a loss if they don't see any chance for DKNG to rise above $67 by April 1st. 

That then is the bet you're taking on - if DKNG rises about 2 dollars above $67, or around $69, by April 1st, you WIN and can sell the contract for a profit. If it doesn't, you LOSE and either the contract becomes useless on April 1st or you sell it at a loss before then.",EtadanikM,4,/r/stocks/comments/md8gnc/dkng_weekly_call/gs84wmx/,0.063,0.806,0.131,0.9822
625,DTE," Naked calls should have infinite profit potential and max risk of premium paid. Your breakeven price is $68.88 by the close on April 1st.

Did you mean profit target of $600? I'm not sure what level of option experience you have, but the underlying price will vary with DTE in regards to your $600 profit target. On 4/1 you would need the stock to be around $74.88. 

If the stock shoots up by $3 tomorrow you might be able to attain a $600 profit sooner. You would need an options calculator and input the other variables, interest & volatility, to get a better idea of what your options are worth.",GreyTrader,3,/r/stocks/comments/md8gnc/dkng_weekly_call/gs8208b/,0.025,0.798,0.177,0.9626
626,DKNG," Ok. You are trading options, so haha, you have a few options. You never have to exercise. Any time before 4/1 at 3p you can trade the premium. The more heavily traded the tighter the B/A spread will be. At any given time, you can get a very good idea of the value of your option. DKNG usually has a tight spread, maybe only $.15 wide so you can hit bids to get out and you're not giving up much. 

So take exercising off the table. That leaves sell out at any given time before 4/1 or roll your option at either a debit (you pay) or credit (you get paid) to an expiration date beyond 4/1. 

I'll give you one example, and you can take the parameters and hopefully make some choices afterwards. 

Since you are an option noob, I would suggest ignore rolling, and that leaves you just one option, close your position at a given time (or let it expire worthless and lose your $188, but we're not Debbie-downers here and we'll assume you rock this and make some fn money). 

DKNG closed today (3/25) down $1.13 @ $65.50. Your 4/1 67c closed down $.50 around 2.05 and the closing delta is .43, meaning for every $1 DKNG goes up, your option will go up $.43 give or take some variables. 

Tomorrow being Friday, some weird shit can happen, so let's say DKNG is up $2.50 at $68, and your option is up about $1 trading around $3. If you decided to put a limit day order in to sell at $4 you would probably need DKNG to trade a shade under $70 to get filled.

I would recommend putting a limit order day order (NOT GTC) in to sell your option at $4. Maybe you get filled, probably not, but you will see how the market reacts, where your order sits in relation to the market, and hopefully, by next Thursday you can figure out what price you want to exit.

669,CIA," Palantir is a company that usually gets on the news for one of three reasons:

* Racial discrimination allegations, especially against Asians, which fall within the same theme of the company being tied to US counter intelligence, whose main opponent is, of course, China but also, to a lesser degree, all other foreign powers.
* Its participation in controversial Trump-era projects, like ICE detention, which indicate a conservative / nationalist bent that, if you combine it with the above two factors and founder Peter Thiel's political beliefs, almost makes it seem like a industry equivalent of the Homeland Security Department.
