13,PENN," 

Penn has 45 casinos spread across the country so they weren’t as affected by the shutdown in Nevada only.  People like to drive close to go out vs flying into Vegas to gamble at times.  (Penn may own the Tropicana, I’m lazy to look.  That’s one reason.  They are also opening sportsbook bars in various casinos capturing more revenue and card holder information.  

Penn is also now into i-gaming on the barstool app. 

Penn gets 36% revenue from barstool and will buy up to 50% of barstool with that contract option in 2023. 

Barstool is a growing media empire:
Podcast, 
Merchandise sales, 
Product advertisement on podcasts
Ad revenue sales (commercials), 
YouTube revenue, 
Owns some stakes in beverages like high noon and new Amsterdam Pink Whitney, 
Maybe some revenue connection to BUZZ ETF - not sure but Dave teased it, 
One Bite pizza stores are a potential future revenue streams, 
Shows with celebrities like Deion Sanders have huge potential down the road, more relatable than ESPN, 
Now added today to the S&P500.  PENN will now get the added advantage of passively being added into hedge funds. 

On the earnings call Penns ceo Jay Snowden mentioned that penn spends on the low end of what it takes money wise to acquire a customer. Penn also doesn’t spend $100’s of millions on advertising each quarter. 

They have a ton of cash on hand to help balance out the debt ratio and it will only get better. 

By EOY 2021 Penn will he in 12 states total which means growth runway ahead thus year and the next five years as states open. 

Barstool and penn partner with younger influencers like Josh Richards, Logan Paul and nick mercs through stock which is a great way to entice them to help grow the brand rather than just show up for a salary.  

Dave Portnoy who has moved into more of a top tier celebrity which gives him access to other celebrities.  He is now friends with Grutman in Miami. 

Women lead the company (ceo, cfo, cro). Erika nardini is gold! 

Barstool fund is another way to introduce the barstool brand to the world through good will.  $40 million raised!

They have a unique story of growth and partnership which is captured in stool scenes. For
Me before I invested heavily in PENN I watched a ton of sequential videos of barstool over the years which shows year over year growth - gives more confidence they know how to grow.  Continues today with new ideas like “surviving barstool - production value getting better.

Now, there are tons of more layers to this and DKNG might still have better overall technology and UI/UX than PENN. But strictly on the sports book tech end, from what I’ve read, KAMBI is the market leader with the greatest sport books capabilities, markets available, odds offering, and risk management compared to SBTech (doesn’t create its own odds for example) and other competitors. So I wouldn’t say PENN’s sport betting or live casino tech is subpar to DKNG’s, but the rest of the stack might be.",Horrawful,8,/r/investing/comments/m3v0po/penn_national_gaming_penn_being_added_to_sp_500/gqs8ejn/,0.024,0.911,0.065,0.8735

They claim that they're targeting fleets, yet:

* The truck has exactly one trim, despite their claim that production is months away.  Fleet vehicles need to be endlessly customizable, and the endurance just isn't.
* It has a claimed 600 hp; only option.  ""Let's hand a vehicle 80% the power of a hellcat to our technicians.  What could go wrong?""
* Only AWD.  Added complexity, cost, and reduced efficiency, and not needed in all circumstances.  2WD option is a must for fleet vehicles.

84,GM," I've been following Hindenburg Research/Nate Anderson for a while -- and while he generally get things right, Hindenburg also stretches the analysis specifically to paint as bad a picture as possible.

Hindenburg also get many things wrong, or leave out details and context.

In the current report, right off the bat they call Lordstown an ""electric vehicle SPAC with no revenue and no sellable product"" -- which is the main thrust of their argument. BUT:

1. RIDE is not a SPAC (Special Purpose Acquisition Company) -- it's Lordstown Motor Company, which merged with SPAC DiamondPeak Holdings Corp (https://www.diamondpeakspac.com/) back in October.

Once merged, it stops being a SPAC. That's pretty basic stuff, which should be obvious.

2. RIDE has only been around since 2019, when they took over GM's [Lordstown manufacturing plant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lordstown_Assembly) (hence the name) and a publicly listed company since October 2020 -- of course it doesn't have ""revenues."" No pre-market consumer business has revenues. 

What Hindenburg fails to mention is it has a $75M investment by GM, which further loaned Lordstown $40M, and has a seat on the board.

3. Lordstown's Endurance pickup is a ""sellable product"" -- but is in active development. Just because it hasn't yet gone into production doesn't change that.

They provide a moat because they are more likely to create a new innovation (solid-state, for example) and they have the option to sell cells/cell components to other companies. In that sense, they have multiple avenues for success compared to a company that buys battery cells from a third party and packages them into modules.

95,HP," Silhouette America must love this shitty move. They have a far superior product, which is better value, but their marketing is inferior to Cricut's. I guess many cricut users will discover them now

Edit: also if I might add, my wife has a Silhouette and we chose it over the Cricut because of their shitty app, that they are now trying to force on their users for $10per month? lol, that is almost the cost of an Adobe app that is actually good. Silhouette is free and allows you to use your local adobe vector files for your designs (as every device should)

I wouldn't have paid a cent for their app and was frustrated from the start that you have to upload your designs to the ""cloud"" to be able to use them.

Considering the above if in their IPO prospectus they base their valuations on their (large) user base and the fact that everybody will have to pay a subscription, this is an easy short for me, even in a bull market.

Edit2: I went on to the cricut msg board, simply because we are in that crafty/small business space and I can't believe what I saw. They are not just forcing their users to pay for a subscription to use their devices that they had to pay for in full, but they are also limiting the designs that you can upload to 20(!!) per month (for free subscriptions I've been told, paid will have unlimited uploads)

WHAT THE ACTUAL F\*\*K?? Imagine if HP told you that ""you can only print 20 pages from March on the printer you paid for. But hey, that's still 240 a year so be grateful!""I can't even convey how outraged I feel about this move, even though we are not directly affected.  Loads of people have set up small businesses during the pandemic either as a side or to make ends meet and Cricut basically renders their machinery inoperable. (just think about all the personalized stuff - can you imagine telling your customers ""Sorry, but you are #21 this month, will get back to you on the 1st)

Bonus: they will have to redo their designs from scratch as they can't export them from the Cricut app.

99,DD," I honestly have no idea.  I never pushed the ""buy"" button at the bottom, as I didn't know at the time when the bottom would actually be, so I missed out on much of the surge in the markets, and while that's brought a certain regret and FOMO, I generally take a fundamental approach to investing and never anticipated the Fed to print trillions of dollars to save the world from a harsh bear market.   These same YOLO people who are manically buying now would have been crushed financially and jumping off tall buildings had the Fed not swooped in to save the day.

The Fed could easily print another $4T and cause all the markets to 10x, or they could decide to stop tomorrow and it all collapses.

But as far as inflation goes, you have to look at living expenses, not asset prices.  The *only* inflation I've seen that's abnormal after $4T of money printing is the appreciation in house prices, but that's not necessarily due to inflation per se, it could be an asset bubble, or a short term surge due to low-supply, high demand and 0 interest rates.  I review my personal living expenses every year, and they *fell significantly* in 2020 compared to 2019.  This year is looking to be a repeat of 2020.  The only place I've really *felt* ""inflation"" is in investment asset prices, or in wanting to buy/build a house.

People keep talking about ""inflation is coming soon, get ready for it!  The sky will fall!"" but let's be real, if inflation were ever to come, it would come within a year after $3.5T was printed; in other words, it would be here *right now*.

Like me, you're probably looking for answers to make good investment and trading decisions.  However, in my experience, as soon as we have good information, the market has already responded, and it's too late.  So the way to win is to make a wild guess, and to be correct in that guess.

The big winners from this bubble you hear about seem to have been really lucky with their trades, but you rarely hear about the ones who made bad bets and lost big - they disappear into the void.  I've done DD on good companies previously, bet big, and then the equity crashed by 80%, while other companies with no profit inexplicably soared.

Being jealous of DFV or other YOLO winners is kind of like being jealous of someone who won a poker tournament or picked the winning lottery numbers.

I looked briefly at the company and not seeing the 100% increase in earnings you noted - Q2 2020 is $0.07 vs Q2 2021 $0.09, am I missing something?  Regardless, I think their contract for drive-thru illuminated signs for QSR is a major win with most QSR I follow looking to expand substantially particularly thru a drive thru model. Coupled with the tailwinds from the inventory build likely needed in their distribution channel post-COVID drawdown I think earnings could grow more than anticipated. Additionally, they seem to be selling down assets - sold their North Canton and New Windsor facilities - These were outright sales but assuming they did sale-leasebacks of their existing owned real estate portfolio at a 6% cap rate and renting at $6/sq. ft. they could unlock about $2/share in value less the $0.12/share in annual rent.

I would choose a couple of diversified majors (I own XOM and SU) and look into oil service companies. The latter have huge operating leverage whereby they can charge much more with more expensive oil and this has a magnified effect on their bottom line. Look at charts of these companies from 10-20 years ago to see what happens to their stock prices -- they do 10-20x, something XOM won't do. Caveat is then you have to figure out when to get out of them. I own a couple, one's one of the bigger players and the other's more like YOLO.

148,NYC," Hi, 

Looking for advice on where to invest $50,000. This was a personal loan which the other party said to hold on to until they need it back, so it needs to be pretty liquid and relatively low-risk.   
Live in NYC and plan to be here for the foreseeable future. Was looking into some vanguard bond ETFs - VNYUX, VTIP, or VTEB/VTEAX.  since this would be in a regular brokerage account, I thought having tax exempt holdings would be good, hence VNYUX (triple tax advantaged for me living in NYC), or VTEB/VTEAX (only federally exempt I think).  The bond outlook overall is not great from what I was reading, but still probably the lowest risk option maybe?

152,KO," I think people focus way too much on diviends. People really should focus on total return . Total return is price appreciation plus dividnes. KO maybe a fine investment it may pay you those dividends and the share price may increase as well.

However dividends usually come at the price of price appreciation and I am not sure why so many people focus so much on dividends . Total return should be the focus and yes dividends can play a part in that

However investing with a focus on dividends (only picking companies with dividends, focusing on companies with high dividends) tends to lag total return than just investing in the broad market

If you take a look at popular dividend index funds like SCHD, VYM, SCHD; they lag on total return of just a simple S&P500 index fund like VOO/SPY

I am not saying run away from dividends or dividends are a bad thing, I just think investors tent to focus too much on chasing dividends",SirGlass,3,/r/investing/comments/m43dkq/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gqsp4hs/,0.065,0.778,0.156,0.9353
153,KO," You might research the topic ""dividend growth investing.""  

Finance theory posits that the value of an asset is the discounted stream of future cash flows attached to the asset (net present value or NPV).  At the most basic level, a stock is valued as the discounted stream of forecasted future dividends.  Note that there are other considerations like balance sheet net assets and open market repurchases.  However, these items can be resolved as either future dividends or dividend substitutes.  If a company is never (ever) expected to pay a dividend, stock investing reduces to the greater fool theory.  

Valuation for a single stock like Coca Cola is open to (non productive) argument based on preferred assumptions.  I would suggest a more useful framework is preferences.

I didn't say you couldn't. I just said the numerator of ttm earnings yield didn't go to near zero at the bottom of the march drop like it did in the 2008 crash.  

>When the earnings yield is less should be the worst time to buy. You’re buying an aggregate of investments with a high PE ratio.  

The value of a stock is all of its future earnings discounted to present value. The past twelve months of earnings, and thus ttm earnings yield and P/E, is only relevant as far as they tell you something about future earnings. You might have better luck measuring value with a smoother benchmark than ttm earnings, like [CAPE](https://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe) which uses a ten year average of earnings.",kiwimancy,2,/r/investing/comments/m43dkq/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/gqtxh8u/,0.056,0.823,0.121,0.8126
