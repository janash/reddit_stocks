3,LKCO," When I'm not being a dumbass, if something looks like it's starting to run I set a trailing stop once I'd lock in at least a 10-15% gain.  The percent I set really depends on how it's ratcheting up or down, as well as the share price.  I've been bitten in the ass by setting trailing stops too tight (triggering a sale when it dipped 8% before spiking another 30+%), and I've also just had them not go anywhere and I would have been better off with a regular sell order.

&#x200B;

Remember, this is only *when I'm not being a dumbass*.  If I followed my own advice I would have just set a 5-7% trailing stop on LKCO on February 16th and just gotten to fucking bask in the fact I would have been up over 250% on the position.",phate_exe,2,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/m3wiq1/thought_it_might_be_appropriate_for_some_of_us/gqsynfy/,0.066,0.822,0.112,0.7596

131,AM," There is zero logic to a single person (it's a single person or a group of people in coordination; no random collection of individuals would decide on that price in isolation from one another) to attempt to sell 257,300 shares of  $1 stock as 2,733 covered calls that no one would purchase at a price that is more than 2x the daily high according to the algo...unless by doing so you're somehow hoping to actively manipulate some aspect of the stock's behavior.  


When this happened, and the stock movement around it, is also strange. For example - at 3:25 PM, volume spikes from a red 57k (3:20 - 3:25 PM) to a green 299k (3:25 - 3:30 PM), and this green volume spike is maintained at above 299k (300k, then 465k) until 3:40 PM. The share price increased by $0.03 over this time.   


At 3:40 PM, the value of the call, after the spike in volume and increase in price, was $0.68. By 3:45 PM, it had declined to $0.65. This reflected a $0.07 increase on the call for the day, which was the result of the stock increasing in cost $0.11 a share, or roughly 10.4 - 10.5%. Makes sense, right? The price of the stock at 3:45 PM was $1.15.   


What doesn't make sense is that same call leaping in cost from $0.65 to $0.90 at 3:50 PM, when volume was 554 K red and the stock price \*declined\*  by $0.02. Why did the call price leap? Because all 257,300 of those shares were put up to be sold as covered calls at $1.25 each. A price double the 'high' for the day, despite share costs decreasing.  


Zooming out for a weekly view at the cost of the call shows that it spiked from $0.58 at close on March 8 to $2.63 (!) at open on March 9, a price that was maintained for 50 minutes, before dropping all the way back down to $0.58 by 11:20 AM. The action of the stock between close March 8 and open March 9? $0.03 increase, less than 4%. The stock \*declined\* in price by 2% while the call maintained a price of $2.63. When it dropped back to $0.58, the price of the stock had actually increased by $0.01 from opening!

The stock maintained a decidedly positive trend for the rest of the day after the option price declined and stabilized. This increase continued after-hours, and the stock price fell quickly on March 10th. It moved sideways / slightly up on March 11, before opening below closing value on March 12. After the call spike described above, the cost of the stock went from $1.14 to $1.18 in after-hours - a sizable increase, especially given that DNN already experienced a 8.65% increase in value on the day. 

I don't know what they were attempting to do, but I have a hunch, though. I think this was an attempt at manipulating the share price through a gamma event, for the purposes of selling options to themselves - possibly for the purpose of stuffing an account, or for the purposes of cornering the market on a particular option during a period of high volatility and demand? 

Call volume went from never exceeding 1,400 of any type in any 5 minute period throughout the day to 17,000 call volume (!) between 3:05 and 3:10 PM. I think volumes of calls must have been intentionally and cheaply purchased over a period of time, exercised ITM in cohesion with one another, which quickly increased the price of the stock and bumped the IV up dramatically on a day when it had generally been stable, even as the price of the stock was increasing. The shares from all of those exercised options were possibly then immediately listed as calls I saw whose prices were so high and out of sync. Obviously, some of these calls were sold - or the algo would not have tripped the way it did!
