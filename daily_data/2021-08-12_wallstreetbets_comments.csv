Only way it would be good is if they sold their services for cost savings but instead they want to be a health insurance company in a crowded field with low growth potential which is why the stock is in gutter. Though honestly whatever system they came up with is probably no different than any other redirection rule system other health insurance companies have come up with on their own. 

No doctor is going to pay for you to tell them what to do which is why they have to pay doctors to use their system. 

So their profit to revenue is getting more members while paying doctors to use their system. So innovative! Lol.

Down vote all you want but they paid more in claims than they had in revenue. What happened to their super AI system? Hahaha.

""2x reimbursement

Simple, Fast Reimbursement

Receive double the Medicare reimbursement rate within 7 days for each patient seen with the Clover Assistant""

# 2x is damn good. At least around here, it blows away just about every other rate offered.

Every health insurance out there negotiates payment as a % of medicare. We'll pay you 110% of Medicare (which is considered shittier than you think CLOV is), 120% (pretty awful), Universities because of their weight and ""Why is the big U not in my network"" drives away customers, may get academic rates of 300-400% of Medicare

So 2x is a big deal to most of the community rank and file. My wife's practice just got upped to 130% of Medicare  by their private IPA because of competition trying to lure doctors away into their plan.  It's still considered pretty bad considering the cost of living around here. 140% is considered Ok at best. It's not that they are billing medicare more, that's pretty much fixed. They're reducing how much they take from the pie before they give what's left over to the physicians, who then have to pay rent, staff, health insurance, malpractice, equipment costs. This is also why if Advantage private plans for Medicare exist, because base Medicare is not very good. 

Did you know by the way that the lowest reimbursement rates in Medicare are Ro Khanna's district, and Nancy Pelosi's? Which are high COLA areas. But in any district, 200% would be an amazing improvement.

And tons of older people with Medicare A+B come in wanting care and these reimburse at....drumrolll... Medicare rates.

Our anesthesiologist friend notes that if he only saw straight Medicare A patients they'd go underwater after paying all the costs of staying in practice.

""they have to pay doctors to use their system"" - there are penalties for not being enrolled as a Medicare provider. Plenty do not take Medicare, because they don't see older patients usually. For example, Plastics, OB/GYN. If they do see someone say through the ER, they get paid < 100% of Medicare as a penalty. So it more or less forces docs who have to see ER and other inpatient consults to enroll even at the shitty rates so they get something which is better than nothing. Docs who don't need to, and can build a practice without needing to do those things often won't. Like, my dermatologist.

Every system either pays to get people into their network or punishes them for not participating.

Actively paying doctors to use their systems and enroll in their plans depending on how it is done would violate the Stark Anti-Kickback Statutes. You don't fuck with the IRS and you don't fuck with CMS. Negotiating better reimburesement rates for doing the same work is not a kickback by lowering costs, increasing coding accuracy, efficiencies, fewer dollars left on the table for the work you did is highly attractive.

Do they take some of the reimbursement to cover costs such as Clover Assistant? Yes, of course.  If you go see your doctor, either they're paying for the electronic health record program they are using on your case themselves, or they may belong to an IPA or organization who takes part of their professional fee to pay for that. It's never free. My wife's practice belongs to an IPA which provides EPIC EHR for them, and it's not free.

They just don't tell you that the 110% of medicare they are paying you for that patient would be 160% after paying their executives, IT, support staff, and EHR which is tens of thousands a year.

102,OB," Based on what you just wrote, I don't think you understand how things are paid for, including electronic health record programs that your doctor has to use when they see you, or how the reimbursement works, or why they will participate in one insurance plan but not another.

""2x reimbursement

Simple, Fast Reimbursement

Receive double the Medicare reimbursement rate within 7 days for each patient seen with the Clover Assistant""

# 2x is damn good. At least around here, it blows away just about every other rate offered.

Every health insurance out there negotiates payment as a % of medicare. We'll pay you 110% of Medicare (which is considered shittier than you think CLOV is), 120% (pretty awful), Universities because of their weight and ""Why is the big U not in my network"" drives away customers, may get academic rates of 300-400% of Medicare

So 2x is a big deal to most of the community rank and file. My wife's practice just got upped to 130% of Medicare  by their private IPA because of competition trying to lure doctors away into their plan.  It's still considered pretty bad considering the cost of living around here. 140% is considered Ok at best. It's not that they are billing medicare more, that's pretty much fixed. They're reducing how much they take from the pie before they give what's left over to the physicians, who then have to pay rent, staff, health insurance, malpractice, equipment costs. This is also why if Advantage private plans for Medicare exist, because base Medicare is not very good. 

Did you know by the way that the lowest reimbursement rates in Medicare are Ro Khanna's district, and Nancy Pelosi's? Which are high COLA areas. But in any district, 200% would be an amazing improvement.

And tons of older people with Medicare A+B come in wanting care and these reimburse at....drumrolll... Medicare rates.

Our anesthesiologist friend notes that if he only saw straight Medicare A patients they'd go underwater after paying all the costs of staying in practice.

""they have to pay doctors to use their system"" - there are penalties for not being enrolled as a Medicare provider. Plenty do not take Medicare, because they don't see older patients usually. For example, Plastics, OB/GYN. If they do see someone say through the ER, they get paid < 100% of Medicare as a penalty. So it more or less forces docs who have to see ER and other inpatient consults to enroll even at the shitty rates so they get something which is better than nothing. Docs who don't need to, and can build a practice without needing to do those things often won't. Like, my dermatologist.

Every system either pays to get people into their network or punishes them for not participating.

Actively paying doctors to use their systems and enroll in their plans depending on how it is done would violate the Stark Anti-Kickback Statutes. You don't fuck with the IRS and you don't fuck with CMS. Negotiating better reimburesement rates for doing the same work is not a kickback by lowering costs, increasing coding accuracy, efficiencies, fewer dollars left on the table for the work you did is highly attractive.

Do they take some of the reimbursement to cover costs such as Clover Assistant? Yes, of course.  If you go see your doctor, either they're paying for the electronic health record program they are using on your case themselves, or they may belong to an IPA or organization who takes part of their professional fee to pay for that. It's never free. My wife's practice belongs to an IPA which provides EPIC EHR for them, and it's not free.

They just don't tell you that the 110% of medicare they are paying you for that patient would be 160% after paying their executives, IT, support staff, and EHR which is tens of thousands a year.

Grandma needs a new hip. Hurts to walk around. She can't get in to see a doctor, or doesn't want to go because she's afraid of the 'rona.

The docs at my wife's hospital noted a huge drop in appendicitis. 400+ a year, dropped to a trickle. Usually it's 20-30 minutes surgery, in and out in less than a day, sometimes hours. Now they're ruptured. Need 5-7 days in the hospital or longer, on antibiotics, need hoses put in.

One less surgery. Much more expensive claim.

Lot of cancers coming in in late stages. My wife told a patient to get screened for colon cancer. Didn't want to, has family with colon cancer, said he didn't want to because he was avoiding hospitals. 8 months later, stage IV cancer, spread everywhere. Not a candidate for surgery, only chemo

36-48 hour stay after a 1 hour surgery 8 months ago, with a colonoscopy, now no surgery, weeks in the hospital getting lots of tests, starting chemo, being treated for blood clots because cancer does that, dealing with the other shit stage IV cancer does to you. 8 months ago, probably stage 1 or 2

One less surgery. Much more expensive claim.

By the way, as things improved with the 'rona, in late May to June they had a record number of surgeries come in. The hospital had the best quarter in the last 10 years in fact.

You mentioned that they signed up 129K in a just few counties like it's pathetic. The average internist takes care of 800-2000 patients. When they get patients who have better reimbursement like CLOV, and they other insurers won't match it, guess what happens to the people with the worst insurance. ""We don't take  your plan anymore. These are the plans we do take. By the way, this one also includes dental, vision for free (CLOV)"" Not taking new patients changes to ""New patients welcome."" because there's room. Other payers lose market share. Retired patients start to switch or complain to their bosses their insurance sucks. Since they can only enroll once a year around December, it takes time to see that shift.

If what you were saying was true we‚Äôd be seeing this in earnings reports across different insurers which we aren‚Äôt. Instead we are still seeing healthy profits from health insurance companies.

I literally deal with analyzing data from multiple insurers billions of claims worth of data. I specialize in radiation therapy and chemo treatment savings programs and I can tell you what you‚Äôre saying on the aggregate is nonsense. 

Look at the Clover website and show where they talk about any of their actual health savings programs instead of vaguely mentioning their little assistant program. Hmmmm about some papers released by them mentioning their programs talking about reduction in PMPM or Utilization? Nope not that either. 

You‚Äôre also somehow claiming that Clover will be stealing a significant amount of people from people like Aetna, United, Blue Cross, Humana and etc. 

Like you literally don‚Äôt know anything about the health insurance side and think just because your wife is a doctor you somehow have an inkling of knowledge of what‚Äôs occurring.

If you‚Äôre spending more in claims than revenue your health savings programs are shit and this AI you‚Äôre bragging about isn‚Äôt saving as much as you‚Äôre trying to claim it will.",adderallanalyst,-13,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p2mfsy/clov_trying_to_stay_above_9/h8m9rcf/,0.056,0.848,0.096,0.7506

Insurance companies do help them code better by redirecting them to the cheaper procedures that are also more medically appropriate based off the diagnoses and set of rules for the patient which the doctors input when making the claim. I literally pull the data, caulculate the ROI, help create, and help launch programs like these while maintaining their savings models.

Totally a paper pusher unlike you. ü§£ü§£ü§£

Additionally most insurance companies are trying to focus more on the Medicare side as there is more money to be made and saved there unlike commercial. The fact that they only do Medicare yet spend more on claims than they get in revenue is actually horrible. I am somewhat curious how they‚Äôre fucking up this badly to pull that off.


Like I said you‚Äôre outside you‚Äôre realm of how insurance companies make profit.

But this strategy dies t work every time, sometimes stocks keep climbing up and we miss out better profits, or the dips keep dipping due to shorts attack over longs (but eventually comes up - it may take a day or 2 or more depending on market sentiments). 
But overall, if the company is good (and PLTR is one among the good ones) then even after temporary dips abs swings - it comes back up‚Ä¶

1098,TA," Well, this is where TA starts to become a little more like astrology, and the answer is that the pattern may or may not hold. Using the same methodology I used with the last retracement (there's a tool for it in the left bar, and it takes a little bit of experimentation with it to get it to do what you want), here's what I got for a predictive range:

[https://imgur.com/CDD8wPN](https://imgur.com/CDD8wPN)

So this suggests the break at just above $560, and it rarely lands perfectly with a parabolic run so going a little bit above makes this consistent with OP's prediction.

My rule on TA and patterns is that if a stock has behaved previously to algorithmic rules, it likely will do so again, but be sure to hedge. This works better with stocks with high volume and high institutional ownership because those often signal the presence of market makers using algorithmic patterns to generate outcomes, and algorithmic patterns respond to algorithmic patterns.

But like HoleyProfit said, there's usually other catalysts involved with timing. What this does is let you time the prep of your strategy so that you're a little early on execution hopefully, which is key to ideal positioning.

The minute the trend stops behaving the way you think, start to reassess and determine how far out it is. Human trends will buck the algorithmic trend, but eventually the stock will return to the trend if the algorithmic tendency is dominant. In this case, there's definitely a human component, so expect an overshoot, but this is also heavily institution owned and subject to the institution-heavy S&P 500, so that it shows algorithmic trends is not a surprise to me.",Moist_Lunch_5075,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p2o5kp/mrna_trade_plan_and_tendencies_at_the_end_of_a/h8lqxt9/,0.022,0.892,0.087,0.9627

1100,TA," Exactly. Since we have multiple dynamics interacting, it's never going to land perfectly, but it's a really good guidepost for understanding what kind of behavior dynamic you're in and start expecting moves.

I think supplementing these expectations with zoomed out analysis of moving average trends, volume trends, strength trends, and weighted run trends supplements to target when to take action. I'm still tweaking my own strategy on this, but I've been going back to my suboptimal plays and checking various signals to see if I could have divined something using TA and I'm finding that in the day moving average and strength dynamics can be strong buy/sell signals and zoomed out strength and weighted/volume predictive trends can help identify the rough timeframe to be looking for action. If the trend is one month, and the chart is one month, then I've found that the EMA 8 crossing the EMA 21 after a downtrend is often a good buy signal, particularly if it's sharp and backed by an undersold trend, high volume, and high sentiment for calls, and the opposite for puts (or ideally a little ahead for each one as it tightens). I also factor in whether the candles start dipping below the EMA 8 a lot, because that indicates a loss of upper limit buy pressure.

I'd like to put forward that the 161 reversal patterns are likely to hold at the end of wave 5 in big reversal and at the end of ABCs on trend pullbacks.

1111,RIDE," You are simply wrong and delusional

Production - No clue if RIDE or their investors understands what the word means, but the company essentially said they are hoping to start deliveries in Q2' 2022. I would think the correct term for what they want to start in Sep is called ""pre-production."" Last quarter, if I recall they were suggesting 1,000 deliveries this year... Guess that critical milestone that gets you revenues being pushed back a half year is a footnote.

Cash - They have 366M cash on hand at end of Q2. The company said in their own earnings report that through year end they will have well over 400M in expenses. Well the math is easy and it means that as things stand by year end they are insolvent. Previously they claimed to have sufficient cash to get to produce those 1,000 vehicles, now not. Guess that is also bullish somehow.

400M on Tap - Well read the terms of the ""Equity Line of Credit"" which is just a fancy way of saying share offering. It is for about 35M shares with limits on how many they can unload at a time. At a share price of $6 at most it gets them about 200M. Of course selling those shares should drive down the price netting them even less.

What else... End of Oct, Steve Burns can sell over 20M shares of his stock, which I assume he will... Guess what share price even lower. This means the company will have trouble raising any further funds to stave off insolvency.

Going back to that cash situation... So by year end they are short about 40M in cash and, even if they raise 200M they will still need to raise additional funds to make it to deliveries in Q2' 2022. So further dilution and at a likely lower share price.

No clue how anyone calls this call bullish.",aka0007,23,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p2yw5q/ride_earnings_september_production_confirmed/h8njfln/,0.053,0.819,0.128,0.9769

1114,GM," Plenty caught that and dismissed it as meaningless nonsense. The borrowing base of the plant is going to be less than what they paid for it. The can show up with any valuation they want, but no one is going to lend against it (maybe they can get 50-100M against it with a priority lien, assuming the fire sale value of the equipment is even worth that much... for the factory itself the value would be zero as GM shut the darn thing down and not sure anyone would pay a dime for it). The only loan they will get will be one from a company that will require them to issue as many shares as necessary to repay it (e.g. if they lend 100M and the share price falls to 4, then issue 25M shares, if it falls to 2, then issue 50M shares and so on).

The ELOC, is not what anyone in their right mind would call a line of credit, but rather a share offering. It is all in the SEC filing as to exactly what the terms are.

1117,RIDE," The ATVM loan is a pipe dream as the government will not want to give it to bailout a company. They got a lot of flack over the program when they actually lent money under it about 10 years ago. In fact, Workhorse and Lucid have both tried to get this loan and went through due diligence to never getting it in the end. Maybe time to recognize the ATVM loan is not happening.

The ELOC, is a 35M share offering, where RIDE can unload a limited amount of shares at a time and their proceeds are based on a 3% discount of the next three days price. At current values they would net about 195M under it. It is not enough cash to get them to commercial deliveries in Q2' 2022. It does not remove the going concern as the company's projected expenses and CAPEX for the near future, even adding in proceeds under the ELOC is not enough to keep the lights on for a year.

In terms of partnering with other OEMs to produce products... Well how about produce your own product first? In any case, what OEM will invest hundreds of millions in you to build production capacity, when you are headed to insolvency? Does not make sense. Also, Lordstown has yet to demonstrate in a real-world example their skateboard platform. Their Lordstown day had speeds limited to 40 mph. The SF250 had them average 20 mph in a heavily modified truck.

Regarding, other, non-dilutive financing. While Lordstown might imagine their factory is worth a lot, what they mean to say, is for them, if everything works out it is worth a lot. For someone else, it is worth a fraction of what they spent on CAPEX as it would require lots of additional work to reconfigure it to a different vehicle. This means, the borrowing base of their factory, regardless of what BS valuation they come up with (which no one will lend against, but will be used in the Q3 earnings report to convince fools that they have a lever to pull still) is not enough to save them.

Right now, as things stand, the only way Lordstown has a chance at success (assuming their product actually works as promised and can be produced economically, which I also doubt) is for the stock price to go way up allowing them to raise funds to get to commercial production. Other  than that, the company is effectively worthless as it is headed to insolvency. In short, if their stock price does not go up a lot in the short term, prior to them selling those 35M shares and the end of Oct when Steve Burns can sell half his shares (over 20M) and dilution drives the share price down, the company is simply beyond the threshold of any salvation. Of course even if the price goes up and the raise the funds, they still need to actually successfully produce a vehicle they have yet to properly demonstrate.",aka0007,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p2yw5q/ride_earnings_september_production_confirmed/h8obus7/,0.036,0.882,0.082,0.9693

1143,IMO," I was thinking about a possible uber bullish scenario on SPY especially seeing QQQ today and with OPEX tomorrow maybe giving us some volatility and the energy to get us unstuck from our current slow melt up.

I think running a test of the former break out area of 440.86 - 440.68. Also where the 10 MA is near on the daily.

1 it would give the bulls a good dip and maybe get some cash off the sidelines.

2 It would entice some bears just drooling at the chance to maul this down at these high prices and help rally us through a trendline going back months after getting us to 446.20 ish or the measured move. If you did get some contracts at 440.80ish Id take profit but hold a few for a possible blow off top.

With the tight consolidation the market is edging to blow its load IMO but not without a dip and bear trap to get us through. I would actually be shocked if we melt up there without it. Anyway just to keep in mind.

The GIGA factory raised the stock price. Vertically integrated battery manufacturing raised the stock price. Independent best in class safety rating raised the stock price.

DRAM in particular has slowed down dramatically in the past few months, with manufacturers competing on price to sell their inventories, while dealing with increased costs from raw material supply limitations.

Expect consumer DRAM prices to drop by up to 10% and stay there until 2023 while manufacturers cut into profit margins to stay competitive. 

Server refresh contracts with all major datacenters seem to have already been signed and there's no upside or additional customers, it'll stay stagnant for at least a year.

1236,GDP," I'm confused, do you:

1. think that the BEA and/or BLS (not the Fed, by the way) have been underreporting the true inflation figure and it has already been unleashed onto consumers?
2. or that inflation is like momentum, pent up in financial markets and housing, waiting to be ""unleashed"" onto consumers?

Because those two are contradictory positions. Inflation is a rise in the consumer price levels, not asset price level.

If you think (1), then what do you reckon the true figure for inflation is? What are you basing this on? Do you think governments that issue debt in their own currency want to keep the real value of debt elevated? Keep in mind the US has had, on average, 4-5% nominal GDP growth and the longest job creation streak in history since the financial crisis.",MinhNguyenPFL,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p2u5sw/so_what_if_inflation_is_transitory/h8n7tbh/,0.102,0.787,0.112,-0.3335

No they had to. And they will have to again and again and again with the problems were facing. It's MMT. That's why I think savers are doomed and productive debt will be inflated away. Inflation is the savour of the those that take on too much debt.

MMT is a ""monetary"" theory about debt and growth, sovereign borrowing has existed for centuries. In fact, sovereign borrowing is *how* there is **money** in first place.
