Here's another thought experiment... What if the housing market is booming right now NOT because of more people wanting to own a home in a pandemic... But because the Fed has printed TRILLIONS of dollars recently & we're all about to experience HYPERINFLATION so a fuck load of institutional investment corporations are buying up real estate assets like candy because the price of EVERYTHING is about to SKYROCKET.

127,AM," OP godspeed but I have been watching PLTR every single day for like 3 months and you're doing 2 of the things that almost guarantee you to lose money w/ PLTR calls.

1) you're buying them for a week when the Fed is speaking. J POW talks on like Wednesday and/or Thurs (not to mention Biden). He might not say something bad but recently the market always acts like he is going to until he actually speaks. This is largely what causes the stretches where PLTR bleeds down to like ~$21.50.

2) you're not buying the dip (when it's below or at least @ $22/share). You bought them when PLTR is doing reasonably well by its standards recently.

Seriously, like 1/3rd of the S&P is reporting earnings this week which could make things volatile as fuck. Also Biden and J pow are speaking. I'm not saying I know what's going to happen, I just know at LEAST one day is going to be blood red and perhaps catastrophic. And Jeronimus Powell can make the whole week red if he wants to with a simple flick of his forked little tongue. There is also of course the chance that everything moons but... It's PLTR lol. 

Luckily you could be saved by the Monday morning rip. This could be great if you pill it off. Usually no matter what, PLTR will rip for a second first thing in the AM (it might dip first), but after that there is a real chance of it cratering and bleeding out for the rest of the week.

Best of luck, if I were you I would sell as soon as I make any profit whatsoever and re-up when PLTR craters this week during the volatility. I've lost so much money doing what you're doing and have gotten it back by:

1) buying pltr calls on the dip (sub 22)
2) doing 2 week expiry minimum to save my ass incase anything happens 
3) paying attention to the fed schedule

175,LDL," In just a few years there have been a number of rather impressive tools made, namely base editing and prime editing. This stuff is pretty exciting so ill give a brief overview.

My understanding here is that the crispr-cas complex causes double stranded breaks, which in turn causes unwanted indels that decrease the efficacy of the edits. It's enough to do gene suppression by the looks of it (which is what nearly all clinical trials have been doing), but not enough to correct for faulty genes. With base editing this problem goes away.

One of my favorite collaborations in the space is between beam therapeutics and verve therapeutics. There is a mutation inside of the pcsk9 gene that is naturally found in a small percentage of African Americans. It results in an **80% reduction in the chance of having a heart attack over a persons life**, as it causes LDL and triglycerides to be significantly lower over a person's life time.

They were able to induce this same edit in non-human primates and saw similar reductions in LDL and triglycerides. If they were able to do this safely in humans, I dont see why anyone would want to go without it as about 1/3 people die of heart attack.",AbsurdData,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/my875z/crsp_leaps_ctx001_is_going_to_market/gvtzcxz/,0.117,0.794,0.089,-0.8594

216,GME," Shorting stocks surely.. you can’t lose that kinda money going long in this market

Edit: I was wrong. They employ a long-only equity strategy. Per their website “Systematic Macro is a global strategy that allocates risk dynamically across several asset classes including sovereign debt, equity indices, commodities and currencies in developed and emerging markets.”

Also did some more digging- interview with IPM here: https://thehedgefundjournal.com/ipm-informed-portfolio-management/

Interesting excerpt that applies to wsb quite well..: 

“Leverage aversion is one facet of behavioural finance research that interests IPM. The theory is simple enough – if investors cannot use portfolio leverage, then those investors seeking to up the ante of their portfolios will be drawn to riskier assets as the only way to turbocharge their portfolios. This might include high-beta stocks, for instance. Investors might then ascribe higher valuations to such riskier stocks than they would if they were able to apply leverage to less risky, lower beta, stocks. IPM does not face this constraint: the portfolio can run gross exposure up to 15 times and will typically be around nine times.

As for why they don’t short stocks: “Simply inverting long factor tilts to try to arrive at short signals does not work, he says. And even if it did, shorting entails practical problems of short squeezes and Lindell thinks that shorts could “stay underwater for a long time,” as they may overshoot on the upside.”

Smart considering this interview was before the GME saga..

TLDR: IPM trade everything from commodities and currencies to stock indices like SPY. They don’t short stocks but rather we’re leveraged to the tits, trading with a ton of margin with a typical 9:1 leverage to capital ratio.",Ballsmeetpets,52,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/myfwlu/hedge_fund_ipm_closes_after_losing_4_billion_in/gvusaur/,0.076,0.883,0.041,-0.7812

If I remember correctly, [their stock had a impressive increase in the beginning, but took a big dive shortly after](https://www.investing.com/equities/molycorp-inc./) which didn't stop until the company shut down. The simple problem with getting about 83% of rare earth materials from china is that they control something along the lines of a monopoly. If they decide to lower the prices for only a short period of time to the point that MP Materials operations get unprofitable, they're going to bleed out very quickly. This exact circumstance was [the reason why Molycorp failed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molycorp).",hawkisdead,27,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mxxac8/mp_is_about_to_soar_dd/gvtcier/,0.048,0.849,0.104,0.753

265,SI," Right - so let's talk numbers then and what I expect to see for Q1 2021 results as an example.   I took a look at the average price of Dysprosium and Neodymium (since they make up 84% of demand weighted by price) and found their daily price from beginning of Q4 to end of Q1.  The average price went up 50% from Q4-Q1, and MPs costs have remained the same (or even went down) over the last year.  So with that in mind, it's pretty easy to calculate the projected Q1 EPS at $0.27 alone! [The spreadsheet I used](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O5HiTyzSbs7v7xsNUM-YF-lY1LEEG9VwYUIqFtdPy0E/edit?usp=sharing) can also be used if you want to run scenarios for the rest of 2021.

Given the price has remained relatively constant through the first month of Q2 - it's not a long shot to predict the Q2 results should be similar, and if I take the pessimistic look for Q3-Q3 and say the price drops somewhere between the prices of Q4 2020 and Q1 2021 - the EPS for all of 2021 assuming only 2% growth of output per quarter works out to be $0.98 EPS for 2021.  [When you look at analyst estimates here](https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/mp/earnings-estimates) the high estimate is $0.53 EPS for 2021, and it'll get close double that with my conservative estimate!  Part of the play is for Q1 earnings - the estimate of $0.08 for Q1 is a third of my calculated EPS which is based on actual market data.  So when Q1 earnings come out and they absolutely crush earnings, this is what my current strategy is targeting.  Along with the high SI and super high utilization, it won't be vulnerable to the typical earnings short attack that funds have been known to do.  

The longer play is harder to calculate given we don't know what will happen to the price of REEs, but the fact they are this profitable so early on is really exciting for me.  At the very least the Q1 earnings play is super strong",boneywankenobi,6,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mxxac8/mp_is_about_to_soar_dd/gvtvg4d/,0.023,0.871,0.106,0.9834

270,MP, Nice legwork. I'll dig into your spreadsheet here in a moment. Are there any share lock ups or anything like that to be concerned about? Per SEC SPAC stuff all of that is getting categorized differently and its something we need to be aware of. Especially looking at the recent MP dilution. It is a little worrisome throwing money at SPACs (even good SPACs) and it ends up just getting passed along to insider shares selling or dilution. I agree it is a good short run play.

420,FSR," FSR is a speculative stock so it not surprising there's a lot of risk factor. You can be as bearish on the cases as you want, but like any speculative stocks if it proves you wrong it'll pop.

First, Magna or Foxconn may take a stake in the company. BUT that's no difference than if they have to issues shares or get into Billions of debt to make the car. I rather have these companies invest in them then they paying these companies to make the car. So in theory less not more risk by taking this approach.

Profits not a concern here as they are startup. Once they start selling cars even as a loss is fine as long as they get orders and can make the car. Amazon and Tesla was never profitable from the beginning.  They already got what 15,000 (?) deposit for the car? This tells you they got customers. 

So anyway the question one should asked when betting on this stock is do you believe Magna (and foxconn to some extend but we only need one for now) will be able to pull this off and make a car. Magna is a great company and makes so many cars for so many companies and they have vast experience. So ya, I'm confident they'll pull it off. That's the question you should asked yourself when you buy speculative stocks like FSR.

I like and trust Magna so yes I'm bullshit on FSR. Even if they could build and sold just 20 car initially in first year of manufacturing the stock will pop.",vegancash,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mydfv3/fsr_bear_update/gvuabzf/,0.09,0.756,0.154,0.9572

424,XXII," In my opinion XXII is a bullish play to look at if you want to find ways to profit off nicotine reg.

The sp has risen considerably on expected FDA approval of their VLN (Very Low Nicotine) products and then moved even higher with Biden admin backing reduced nicotine initiative for harm reduction, smoking cessation and to prevent any new smokers from becoming addicted in the first place.

The way I see it is there is still a lot of room to move higher still. As the CEO said - this is their Grand Slam. Final FDA approval will be a massive catalyst which is being discussed as a when, not an if. May 6 is their next earnings, which seems like a nice opportunity for them to show off a clean balance sheet to new potential investors and a company poised to capitalize on these health initiatives. They may also see a spike in institutional ownership with sp > $5 now (assuming that holds of course)

425,MN," Though that might seem logical, it's false.

Check out some of the published clinical studies.

Univ of Pittsburgh:

Compared to a gradual nicotine reduction, an immediate nicotine reduction was associated with: lower toxicant exposure, fewer cigarettes smoked per day, greater reduction in nicotine dependence, and more smoke-free days

Participants who were assigned VLNC cigarettes smoked fewer cigarettes per day (14.9) than those assigned to their usual brand (22.2)

Smokers of VLNC cigarettes doubled their quit attempts versus smokers of conventional cigarettes

Univ of MN

VLNC cigarettes produced significantly better results than the FDA-approved nicotine lozenge; even the smokers who ultimately did not quit ended up reducing their cigarette consumption by 37%
