76,ZOM,"  ZOM was overhyped too early, but the products in the pipeline itself are not. This sub hyped if up as a short term play, and because of the Carole Baskin video it had a crazy run up.

I'm pretty sure it's going to come back but I just didn't want to wait too long since I'm swing trading and not holding.

Looking like it was the right move.  But the greater penny stock market is definitely taking a dive together regardless of stock quality.   Once all the money bleeds out of penny stocks people will be back to make quick bucks.
