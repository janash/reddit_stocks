0,RH," I complained to FINRA. timely and accurate transmittal of cost basis information is part of ACATS requirements.

edit: Since this comment got some attention I want to share some of the follow-up. Once I mentioned the complaints to regulatory agencies RH managed to figure out what they needed to do to make it work and **my cost basis was transmitted to the receiver.** Not always the correct strike price, but correct initial investment numbers are now at my new brokerage. 

**Do not reply to RH emails**, even though they say you can - **all email is bouncing**. Go to the **web contact form each time** or your requests will not make it into their support system. I sent a new request every day for a week until it showed up, remaining polite but informing them each day that each day of additional delay was noted. 

I did also **complain to SEC**. While FINRA has not yet responded, SEC auto-replied after 5 calendar days. I also complained to my state (CA) department of consumer affairs.

**Good recordkeeping is key to making consumer complaints that result in action.** I don't like companies that treat myself or others poorly; Making official complaints is one of my hobbies. Yes, I'm grumpy AF.

9,IRS," I’m seeing a ton of misinformation here in the comments. I have worked with (not for) various brokerages as an operations manager at investment firms for almost a decade. 

It is standard procedure for cost basis between financial institutions to take up to two weeks to transfer after the assets transfer. They are done in different systems via services provided from DTCC. 

The asset transfer can take 1-2 weeks but it can be even longer if the transfer occurs outside of the automatic customer account transfer service (ACATS), but Robinhood should be using ACATS. The cost basis reporting service (CBRS) handles the cost transfer after the asset transfer. 

So about a month altogether (including basis transfers) isn’t unheard of.

The fact that it’s wrong upon transfer most likely means Robinhood’s system is either disorganized or not properly interfacing to CBRS or both. In reality they have probably never seen this many accounts transfer out and are overwhelmed with processing requests and making errors. In my in my experience it’s not as simple as asking Vanguard or whoever received the assets/basis to update it. Robinhood (or whoever is sending) needs to initiate the request to correct it. This is because cost basis for purchases after 2011 are considered “covered” for IRS reporting purposes — so the sender is basically guaranteeing the info they send......... making it that much worse if it is *wrong*",justAdude_notAexpert,4,/r/investing/comments/m4ojn2/psa_if_you_recently_left_robinhood_double_check/gqxgpil/,0.066,0.903,0.032,-0.8807

But I have a question about that: do they use the entered cost basis to decide which shares to sell when you’re selling? Obviously they should pick the ones you’ve had longest but at the same time they’re just going off manually entered data, so just wondering how it actually works. If the IRS knows how much to tax you, obviously there is a record of when and for how much you bought all your stocks. So why did I need to enter this manually?!

Robinhood has a great, simplistic interface but I left them for obvious reasons. 

I also have a WeBull account because I absolutely love WeBull Desktop, but I only keep around $500 in there. The extended trading hours are nice, but it's owned by a Chinese company and I'd rather support an American company.

I also have a small E\*Trade account that opened some time ago (before I found Fidelity) so I could play with OTCs but they charge you $6.95 per OTC transaction. They also had some questionable things happen during the GME incident. I'll be closing out this account soon.

I hear Vanguard doesn't have a great interface, but I can't speak from experience. I once heard someone describe it as a brokerage for boomers. lol

I mentioned that the only thing I could think of, to really sustain the GME price level, would be if they started raising capital for a big project, or if there was some kind of acquisition.  Both seemed unlikely.  Are there other things we are missing here? Should I worry about the short squeeze still going?

These cheques have resulted in further consumption, people paying off their own debt (no velocity of money), and to an extent financial speculation. As a foreigner, I have stopped depositing funds in my US trading account and plan to convert my USD into my home currency (AUD) during the next short-term US dollar breakout. I was reading there has been a massive increase in debt per working-class citizen ($13,000) in the past year in the US and in comparison to other countries around the world it was by far the largest increase.

233,DDD," Last week saw some recovery for the hard hit tech and growth stocks as investors became slightly more comfortable with inflation forecasts, meaning US bond yields tapered off, which raised stock prices *(they essentially have an inverse relationship, as one rises, the other drops).* In addition, the $1.9 trillion stimulus bill was completed by the US govt.

For some, reduced stock prices provided a buying opportunity, or at least an opportunity to average down the cost of some of the positions.

I don’t expect us to be fully out of the woods yet in terms or recovery, with monday market opening likely to be red all over, as late on friday, bond yields jumped again following low demand for US govt bonds in auction *(when you take into account inflation, the yields on those bonds means you essentially have less money value than what you invested),* however, that should reduce by end of the week.

Still bullish

Taking a step back and Looking at the overall market, this correction was not just healthy, but overdue. While some assets are still overpriced, overall economy recovery provide a good backdrop for further mark growth, at least in the short-medium term. This current period provides an opportunity to *“buy the dip“* on stocks which have a solid future, but also to reap the gain from some sectors that will see rapid growth over the next year. After all, rising inflation forecasts are due to the fact that most economists see the world economies recovering rapidly from the return of normality from COVID.

Buzzing stocks this week

I have created an algorithm that tracks chatter on social media to identify which stocks are trending, by measuring the shift in mentions this week compared to previous week. Meme stocks are purposely filtered out here.

The full results can be found here: [https://buzzingstocks.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/March+Stocks+2-01.png](https://buzzingstocks.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/March+Stocks+2-01.png)

Here’s my commentary on the most interesting ones in there:

* **3D Systems, ticker: DDD**  
Since the time of writing and creating this graph, this stock has shot up **%4.2** and up another **%1.5** in pre-market. Down from All-time high from earlier this year, DDD benefitted from analyst upgrades last week, as its price suffered a big tumble. Furthermore, ARK initiated DDD position in ARKQ (Autonomous Technology & Robotics) ETF yesterday, putting it in the same basket as TSLA. Expect further gains short-term, and high volatility.
* **Accsys Technologies, ticker: AXS**  
This is a very interesting one, especially long-term. A sustainable wood company that produces high technology, alloy-like wood, planting a tree for every one it chops down. Has recently completed the building of 2 large production factories. I might even cover this on a separate article. ***Note:*** *This company has a small market cap, meaning a low number of shares traded, which means it could take longer than you’d like to buy/sell your shares.*
* **Vermilion Energy Inc, ticker: VET**  
Saw a price jump as analysts upgraded its price target last week. Energy companies are rising as demand is forecast to increase over the next few months. Not sure how this one will move in the near-future, one to watch.
* **Teradyne, ticker: TER**  
Another one seeing lots of chatter on the back of ARK positioning. This one is a very exciting prospect to me, and ticks A LOT of boxes, most importantly, very solid finances. The company saw Earnings per share *(total earnings of the company, divided by number of shares, the higher the better)* growth of 64% last year.

Summary

Expect a less wild ride next week than the last few weeks, but still with some turbulence. Reduced prices have created a number of opportunities, which are being picked up by the algorithm.

While there is likely still some downside in the market, longer-term I see a rosier picture, especially as economies recover and return to normality. I see now as an opportunity to purchase some opportunities at strategic prices, as well as a time to rotate into some of the recovery stocks, taking some profits from the growth/tech sectors along the way.

253,AIM," Whilst I share some of your concerns, especially around the 'debasement' of the dollar, I wonder which regions you consider as places good for investment over the next decade?

Personally as a Brit, the UK market is full of dinosaurs in the FTSE and a wild west AIM market. If anything I would say the UK market seems undervalued, but only on comparison to US company valuations of the same sector. Further to that UK market as a whole seems to have reflected a better bellwether of the general economy, i.e. reflection of the effect and recovery of Covid-19 rather than the sillyville rebound we've had in the US throughout. When I ask myself where I've made money this year, it's ostensibly the latter.

Now if we get onto considering Europe, what then is your view on economic policy since 2008 with regards to QE, bail outs like Monte Paschi, or even handling of Greek debt? I don't see us particularly nailing the euro to a cross, but neither do I consider the European markets as a great place to invest, due to stagnation and poor returns.

These are not things I want to affect my investing, I don't want a person being seemingly disappeared tanking shares I hold.

So that's my answer, I think there are risks of regional policy affecting all currencies and markets, and I think we need to factor in the risk faced by the dollar/US market versus the risk faced to other perhaps less compelling/renowned ones.

255,GDP," Two major threads, inflation of USD and drops in returns from US markets.  The second item is easier to deal with - S&P 500 companies get more than 50% of their gross income from markets outside the US, so you can discount loss of buying power in the US pretty much entirely.  Investing in large cap US is getting you as much global market exposure as large cap international in terms of the customer bases for those companies (and therefore the companies revenue stream).  Mind that large cap internationals draw revenue from US market at similar fraction to S&P 500 companies, so flights to international market funds don't actually change exposure to US internal economic weakness unless you go small cap/local market.

About inflation in the US, I suppose you can think this, but it is counter to prevailing market sentiment.  Indeed until a viable alternative currency comes to world market USD seems unlikely to see much in the way of instability (at least not much you can hedge against with some other currency, would need to go to non-currency value stores like gold or crypto).

There are viable non-US markets to invest in if you are concerned about mid-term US instability, but you can construct stronger cases for why those non-US markets are unstable compared to US IMO.  UK, France, Germany, Japan have been traditional bulk of non-US market funds and I wouldn't describe any of those 4 countries as have a better stability outlook than US, UK due to brexit, France & Germany just look at modest real GDP growth over last 5 years, and Japan look at demographic outlook w/ continually aging population and contracting workforce.  Other markets run into more severe problems, either due to currency instability (so already has problem you fear US *might* have), poor industrial output (simply a shit market), or political/social instability which poses economic threat.

As I am a complete beginner, I decided to invest 200$ into Wealthsimple just to get the grip of it. What would be the best way to spread that 200$ smartly while gaining experience ?


200$ is an amount I am willing to lose just for the sake of learning, I know it's really not a lot but I really want to get into it then I'll invest more :)

Second, would I be better served with the ""buy-and-hold"" strategy with a basket of dividend paying Storage REITs, or should I leverage by buying LEAPS Calls and possibly selling Poor Man's Covered Calls on a monthly basis?

It is not always as straight forward as, this company made quarterly profit. Khan academy is a good resource and so it YouTube. There is no one way to invest, so just start information diving and work with what feels good for you.

282,AMC," So not necessarily literature but khan academy is a good resource to learn up on investing. As for AMC, it wasn't doing fine (70% down in a few years prior to covid), it's being dealt hit after hit from Netflix etc, and the pandemic had exasperated the convenience and the possiblity of just watching movies at home. It could have a rebound but I think it's already been priced in for that.

285,RH," Fidelity/Schwab/Vangaurd are the largest brokerages and all good choices ; ETRADE, TDA, Ally , Chase, Plus others are good too, personally I would stay clear of RH.

I have never used Ally invest they are probably fine however I usually just reccomend Fidelity/schwab/vangaurd

Self Directed just means you get to choose what you invest in, you choose individual funds/etf or even individual stocks, wehre managed they will either give you select list of funds or simply choose for you

Managed portfolios usually come with extra fees but they usually won't do anything stupid, with self directed its up to you and they will allow you to do something dumb like invest 100% of your funds in some high risk stock .

288,IRS," The main tradeoff of the 529 plan is tax free growth at the cost of restricted funds usage.   

You might research the 529 restrictions relative to: 

* approved schools list (many international not covered) 
* approved expenses (computers only covered if ...) 
* setup (donor can't be beneficiary) 
* etc. (see IRS pubs) 

One or two years of **potential** capital gains in exchange for numerous restrictions seems iffy to me.  I would consider funding a Roth IRA instead since it is much more flexible.

As to the concept of not trusting Amazon - DB (not a BB) put out a nice piece on this referencing their 2H 2017 survey indicating 85% of respondents who were existing Prime members would purchase prescriptions on Amazon and of non-prime customers 54% would purchase prescriptions on Amazon. So I guess more a question of how superior GDRX's offering is. I'm curious to know though, does the dual share class with super-voting on the Class B's cause any concern for you?",negativeNWC,6,/r/investing/comments/m4vzjt/good_rx_gdrx_is_a_good_investment/gqwic9s/,0.02,0.776,0.204,0.9512

292,AMZN," I've been shorting the shit out of this since it hit 58 and will continue to do so. When news came out that AMZN was basically going to compete with them, GDRX PLUMMETED. But then quickly after that, a slew of analysts (likely holders of GDRX or paid by institutional owners of GDRX) started pumping the ever living shit out of it and it started a meteoric climb back up. And since it reached a new peak, its been dropping ever since. And the last peak also coincides with the insider trading window opening up allowing them to sell, post IPO. And this may be ironic but I actually use GDRX on prescriptions and it's AWESOME. But there's one huge caveat and its that pharmacies don't have to accept the GDRX coupon and have denied me more times then have accepted it.

296,IMO," Yes. They diluted almost at the top lol. Valuation had gotten ahead of itself at that point, so good for them. Most of the insider buying comes from the interim-CEO. My guess is he’s working with the Executive Chairman so they can sell the company in 3-5 years and get a fat paycheck out of it.
