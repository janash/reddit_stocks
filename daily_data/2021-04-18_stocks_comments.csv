0,VERY, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a bad idea to pull back a touch. That‚Äôs actually what I‚Äôve been doing lately. I‚Äôve been keeping my option profits in cash for now until I up my cash percentage a bit. I‚Äôve been VERY aggressive until recently.

3,WB," Generally, there has to be a catalyst for a drop, besides just overvaluation. I feel comfortable in these situations keeping 5-10% cash to buy dips and to have something to fall back to, but actually going into and out of a significant percentage of cash seems to be a way to lose out on a lot of gains long term. The Fed has made money very, very easy to get. It‚Äôs going to be hard to keep the market down for a significant amount of time in this environment. WB himself talks of expected interest rates being the #1 driver of the market and they‚Äôre very low and likely to stay that way for the next few years.

6,DOW," There was an interest rate spike in the 10 yr Treasury about a month or so ago that showed the Fed isn't in complete control of interest rates. A lot of growth/speculative stocks that aren't profitable tanked HARD, especially green energy stocks that were pumped up really high, like in hydrogen and solar. 

The rotation now is into solid value stocks. That can include big tech, but I think index ETFs is a pretty smart way to go, as there's plenty of other value stocks in there that have room to gain. There'll definitely be some pullbacks whenever interest rates spike again, but the last spike appears to have calmed down and the Fed has said they probably won't raise rates until at least next year, unless inflation really picks up. 

Will there be another crash? I'm not so sure. Last March, the catalyst was the pandemic. Right now, we just had another massive stimulus bill, and now we're looking at a massive infrastructure bill that I believe the Dems can pass through reconciliation if they have to. So the US gov't is putting A LOT of money into the economy, plus the Fed is more than likely going to try and keep rates low for the foreseeable future. I think solid value stocks are going to keep growing for the time being. They'll probably do well even through any pullbacks, but it might be a more sideways market when and if the Fed starts raising. If I were you, I'd keep indexing, hold some solid high dividend stocks (T, VZ, MO, DOW, Utilities), and keep some cash on hand to pick up any speculative stocks you like on any pullbacks.",kmw80,1,/r/stocks/comments/mtcntf/is_now_the_time_to_be_fearful/guzd0o7/,0.035,0.772,0.193,0.9923

8,IMO," VGLT. Long term treasuries ETF. Usually has an inverse relationship to the equities market. Just look at its chart from March 2020. It went up when stocks were crashing. Not a bad place to park some cash if you think we're near the peak of a bubble IMO. 

One caveat, the big reason why they went up when they did is because the yield rate went down sharply at the same time (yields and bond prices have an inverse relationship). Yields are still lower than they were in 2019, so there's not as much room to go down, but they've crept up a lot from mid-2020.",birdsnap,1,/r/stocks/comments/mtcntf/is_now_the_time_to_be_fearful/guzl382/,0.015,0.953,0.032,0.1962

19,ATH," I‚Äòm not sure about this. I‚Äòve heard this quite a lot, often compared to the last bubbles like 2000 and 2008. Yet everything is different: margin at ATH, the small investors like us have much more access to information thanks to forums and just publicly available data, so it‚Äòs so much easier to be sceptical if you have a bad feeling once. If I wouldn‚Äòt have the internet for my confirmation bias I would be 100% back in the market after a couple of talks with my buddys who are in a comletely different space on the internet. Yet more people are invested than ever before and there is massive speculation in every asset class. 

And regarding the pandemic, what happens when people get back to their real lifes? The stock-market hype WILL pass as it always did when there ever was alot of euphoria and new investors. They will be the first to leave when they realize you can‚Äòt keep up the 20%-gains for too long and they want to spend their money on parties, new cars, vacations, new homes.

GOOGL is so deeply rooted into our society that I hardly think it will ever stop growing as a company. They own the most useful tool on earth, which virtually everyone uses. I like the way it‚Äôs run, their commitment to their work, and I pay them for services that I need for my business - not to count that the entire YouTube industry (of which I‚Äôm not a fan but it‚Äôs going up) is powered by them; and these guys make some serious money. Also almost everyone watches YouTube or uses Google or Gmail. So I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre overvalued either.

AAPL, I used to be a fan, but after Jobs was gone they started pulling off studf that really isn‚Äôt on. Phones that get bigger and bigger and more expensive and useless every year. Audio jacks removed just to sell badly-designed earphones. Chargers/replacements of all sorts cost an abomination. Their Apple geniuses and warranties usually suck big time, and take ages to work out anyway. The new MacBook pros only come with usb-c ports, meaning you need all sorts of adapters. Previously they had 2 ports on each side, now it‚Äôs only two on ONE side, meaning you‚Äôll be extremely uncomfortable. They slow down old devices on purpose. Ah yes, and they‚Äôve removed the function keys on the MacBooks Pros to replace them with a crappy touchbar no one cares about. I use their products for work **heavily** but won‚Äôt invest since **I deeply dislike the direction they‚Äôre taking.** 

For AMAZON and FB I‚Äôll just say that I find them to be extremely unethical businesses ran by people I‚Äôm not a fan of. I won‚Äôt invest in these either regardless of them being overvalued or not.

TESLA is in an extreme bubble.

They will surely be around for a long time but I attribute their current success to a lack of serious competition as of now.

36,MSFT," Well..

MSFT is constantly investing in very nice stuff, and they‚Äôre doing a lot of AI. I‚Äôm not a fan of them but this holds potential for the future. Also they‚Äôve been around for eons and won‚Äôt be gone anytime soon, if ever. I think it‚Äôs a solid investment and will grow. 

GOOGL is so deeply rooted into our society that I hardly think it will ever stop growing as a company. They own the most useful tool on earth, which virtually everyone uses. I like the way it‚Äôs run, their commitment to their work, and I pay them for services that I need for my business - not to count that the entire YouTube industry (of which I‚Äôm not a fan but it‚Äôs going up) is powered by them; and these guys make some serious money. Also almost everyone watches YouTube or uses Google or Gmail. So I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre overvalued either.

AAPL, I used to be a fan, but after Jobs was gone they started pulling off studf that really isn‚Äôt on. Phones that get bigger and bigger and more expensive and useless every year. Audio jacks removed just to sell badly-designed earphones. Chargers/replacements of all sorts cost an abomination. Their Apple geniuses and warranties usually suck big time, and take ages to work out anyway. The new MacBook pros only come with usb-c ports, meaning you need all sorts of adapters. Previously they had 2 ports on each side, now it‚Äôs only two on ONE side, meaning you‚Äôll be extremely uncomfortable. They slow down old devices on purpose. Ah yes, and they‚Äôve removed the function keys on the MacBooks Pros to replace them with a crappy touchbar no one cares about. I use their products for work **heavily** but won‚Äôt invest since **I deeply dislike the direction they‚Äôre taking.** 

For AMAZON and FB I‚Äôll just say that I find them to be extremely unethical businesses ran by people I‚Äôm not a fan of. I won‚Äôt invest in these either regardless of them being overvalued or not.

TESLA is in an extreme bubble. They might go up for the near future but their revenue sucks, they treat their employees horribly and Elon Musk is an absolute lunatic who misses every single deadline and proposes products that are not fit for life (cybertruck). They will surely be around for a long time but I attribute their current success to a lack of serious competition as of now. But competition will come and I can definitely see Tesla going down in favour of other EV brands. This would be both due to the need of diversification AND the fact that new EV manufacturers on the market would probably make it look very obvious that Tesla is absolutely all speculation.

It's quite easy to look at the full picture by referring to the Financing Cash Flows on the Cash Flow Statement.

It shows debt repaid, dividends paid and shares repurchased. Dividends paid and shares repurchased are both capital returns to the shareholder. 

This is important because by focusing on dividends only, you're ignoring companies that always return capital via buybacks.

Look at FB, they've bought back stock for the past 4 years. The amount of shares they bought in 2020 is equivalent to 0.7% yield at current price but you don't get taxed on it.

ADBE buybacks in 2020 is equivalent to 1.1% yield.

GOOGL buybacks in 2020 is equivalent to a whopping 2.02% yield at current price. It would be >4% yield if bought in March last year.

Looking at dividends alone, TSLA and the above stocks look the same. But TSLA issues stock every year so they're complete opposites.

Companies like NVDA pay a dividend but recently they haven't been buying back stock, instead they've been issuing more stock than buying and they've taken on more debt. 

Looking at cash flow also helps you know which companies are on the net NOT returning cash to shareholders because they're diluting stock and/or adding debt to the balance sheet.

Anyway you will find many companies buyback more stock than they pay in dividends (like MSFT) so you are missing half the yield. All these companies could buyback 0 stock and instead pay it all as a dividend and their yields would jump dramatically e.g. MSFT yield would be over 2% including buybacks.

that's because the market is thousands of stocks, and you have about 15 stocks many of which are trendy/hot, and those always cool off. for example, you have zero exposure to ... insurance companies, which have been doing very well. so I think you need to beef up the holdings in ETFs or funds that cover more stocks and more sectors.

You're mostly in hypergrowth stocks that don't have a lot of earnings to back up their valuations. Lately these types of stocks have been suffering (except for NVDA which I own too). Due to the pandemic many of these received a once in a lifetime boost.

I bought AMD when they announced the Ryzen 2.  All of these are multi year bubbles.

Because most people don't know how to identify a bubble before it starts this is why investors tend to use ETFs to round off those edges.  If one company bubbles the ETF holder profits.  If the company fails the ETF reduces exposure so they lose less.  It's like auto trading but you don't have to pay taxes on it.

211,FB," FB is one of my oldest holdings.  I've pared it back a couple of times so that it doesn't overweight too much and am preparing to do so again soon though I think this run has more in the tank.  Thus I agree with your general summary that it's cheap relative to the market and is a cash printing machine.

I've also found that it is ridiculously susceptible to headline risk.  Last summer CNBC ran an entire campaign against it, using their promo commercial spots to feature snippets from the ADL and others quoting their boycott message.  They managed to drive down the stock price more than 20% before earnings and...poof...advertisers didn't budget despite the constant narrative otherwise.

I bring this up to say this:  My ownership of FB has been wrought with headline risk, and episodes like the above from Congress and/or media attacking an unsympathetic company are common.  As such, I've grown tired of holding the stock, and made much more trading calls on it after the major dips than I have in the shares I've held for years.

270,SFL," I am not making any judgements about SFL beyond the next two quarters. They are a fairly risky company to hold due to their connection to commodities trade, and shipping is a famously treacherous industry. I believe that they are mispriced in the near-term based on available data and fully intend to adjust my position based on risk-adjusted returns and what I feel I can predict.

To be clear, I don't intend to collect any dividends in the short term, I just think that the share price will increase after their next two earnings reports. I mostly hold options.

That said, I do believe SFL is a stronger company since 2004 as they have dramatically diversified their customers and sector exposure.

279,GS," I'm from a maths background, so I mostly look use statistical tools to make trading decisions, so someone else would be in a better position to give you this advice. But I can give you my two cents on how I would approach using industry knowledge.

It's not so much that you should invest in things you're an expert at. You should invest in things that will yield you returns, which can be from any industry, but you just need to understand that financial markets are indicative of the underlying economy.

A weak economy would not bode well for most industries, so whether you have an expertise in an area or not will not likely help you much in any case of a downturn, which serves to show the importance of having a source of income that's independent of your salary and ideally independent of the underlying state of the economy that you are exposed to. That's the academic view.

Most people disregard all of these seemingly easy rationalisations and invest in what excites them, which isn't a bad thing. Without the initial and niche excitement attached we wouldn't have most technologies we take for granted nowadays simply by virtue of the firms not being able to continue producing those later products without people buying the first-pass products. Actual investing is about believing in the possibility of the latter scenario for an industry or firm.

If you have first-hand knowledge about the future of a methodology/paper/piece of research/technology due to industry exposure, you would immediately spot the potential in small and cheap firms. There was an article about a lecturer who became a billionaire by investing in Moderna early. Granted, no one could've predicted Covid, but probability is what you're playing when you're investing anyway, if you want to leverage that first hand knowledge might as well have a shot at the moon if you know where it's likely to end up a month from now.

282,DCF," I agree that Nintendo and Sony are both undervalued, especially Sony.

Nintendo's business is historically pretty cyclical at they've seen their fair share of ups and downs in their recent business history, maybe that's why it is trading at a discount compared to typical relative valuations for companies in their industry. But on the mid-term Nintendo's outlook is extremely strong and going forward I expect more resilience from the Switch platform than their past consoles/handhelds. I think the Switch as a platform/format is here to stay. Their IP's are evergreen and are among the biggest media IP's in the world (Pok√©mon & Mario mainly)(Yes I know Nintendo doesn't fully own Pok√©mon, but still a 36% stake). Switch is projected to outsell the PS5 this year.

So I think Nintendo is a good investment right now.

Sony Group is not a pure ""gaming stock"" like Nintendo. Sony Group's revenue is very diversified. As their name suggests it's a holding group that has a bunch of different businesses. Their businesses can be roughly categorized in production, licensing and/or distribution of  **media & entertainment** content (gaming, music, movies, TV shows, (non-US) TV channels, anime), **image sensors**, **electronics** (consumer and professional) and **insurance** (Japan & SE Asia).

You say you're overbought in the semi industry, but Sony Group themselves generates like 20% of their revenue from semiconductors, mainly in the subset of CIS (cmos image sensors) of the semi industry, but also from LTE chipsets through one their subsidiaries (though LTE chips are overall a very, very tiny part of their business). So keep that in mind.

Btw, something worth noting for Japanese companies is that over the past quarter the dollar and euro have increased in value against then yen. This is a good thing for Japanese companies that get most of their revenues from the non-Japanese market (like Nintendo and Sony). This should help boost Q1 earnings of Japanese companies with mainly international exposure.

I did a DCF analysis on Sony, and even in a mild bear case scenario they're currently trading at about their intrinsic valuation. So in a mild bull case they're trading below their intrinsic valuation.

I would also keep in mind that you're not necessarily going to find good investment advice for companies that have products that have a big reddit following and also have a big reddit following for a competing product. The reddit fanbase will either be wildly optimistic or wildly pessimistic and won't be able to look at the company from a more holisitic & considerate business point of view. It's like redditors that have been saying iPhones are going signficantly decrease in sales when they removed the headphone jack. (the opposite happened) A lot of these redditors are completely out of touch with the broader market tbh and only consider thing from their personal consumer experience point of view. Basically the reddit fanboy perspective is sometimes at odd with the average consumer perspective & overall market trend. This is applicable to stuff like PlayStation, Xbox and Nintendo imho. But also to a game company like EA (which is one of the most hated companies on reddit, but is actually a well managed company that makes good business decisions based on what the overall market demands, EA has been a very good stock investment over the past 5-10 years).

286,AMD," It's hilarious to say that the new PS console is ""pricey"", especially when you consider that the original PS3 with a 60gb hdd, which came out 15 years ago, was priced at $600, compared to the PS5 with the ssd at $500. You don't even have to calculate for inflation to know that's a lie.

Sony and Microsoft both have exclusive games for their consoles and have both built up followings for them with their own benefits. Both consoles are relatively the same in comparison, with a few differences here and there, but loyal brand enthusiasts are going to stick to what they like mostly. Plus, both consoles are hard to find because of the semiconductor shortage, where both cpu/gpu originate from AMD. 

Video games as well should be priced higher than what they were 15 years ago because of inflation too, so there's nothing wrong with that. Just because people get bent over paying more for the price of a game, doesn't mean developers should make less for more work. If you go to your favorite restaurant and they need to charge more because of rising food costs and the want to pay their employees a decent wage, are you going to complain and never dine there again? Hopefully not, but I'm sure a bunch of boomers would. What happens when other restaurants have to increase their prices as well? It's stupid to disregard inflation in specific industries when it effects everything. 

Nintendo is only in the spotlight because they've been doing what they always have, creating something different. They've done it previously both successfully and unsuccessfully, but they know what's working well now and should continue down that path. 

They all have their upsides, but Sony and Nintendo both have a higher chance to bring more returns than Microsoft. Just look at Sony after they launched the PS5.",5dnb17,5,/r/stocks/comments/msz3yh/nintendo_ntdoy_and_sony_bear_cases/guww784/,0.063,0.787,0.149,0.9802

LOL. This is how you proved you're clueless. The reception PS got for their [FIVE HUNDRED AND NINETY NINE DOLLAR console was infamously terrible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOHqG1nc_tw). It's a giant meme in the gaming industry. Sony LOST that entire generation of gaming to Xbox. The PS3 was a failure. The PS4 - which was a huge success - sold at 400$ and it was made at a loss. Sony recouped their money handily by doing what they should have in the first place.

>Video games as well should be priced higher than what they were 15 years ago because of inflation too, so there's nothing wrong with that

Further proof of stupidity and cluelessness about the industry. Games nowadays are chock-full of microtransactions and all kind of exploitative tactics to make money beyond the base price - which atm very few COMPLETE games have. Nintendo's among the few developers to not push the envelope in this direction for their console games, though they're extra-exploitative in the mobile market.

297,IBKR," This is a risk vs. reward situation.

Here's the example:  

1) Borrow money to buy a house at 3% however the bank can sell the house right under me if my house value drops by 10%.

2) Borrow money to buy a house at 6%.

Option (1) is great for better off people (wealthy).  In fact, wealthy people routinely borrow money at a very low rate against their net worth. This is a win-win situation for both the bank and the individual.  As far as the bank is concern,  a guaranteed 3% is better than a 6% with a chance of default.

For the same token,  IBKR lets people borrow at very low rate (margin rate for major brokers are still much lower than personal loan, not just IBKR) because they know they can call back their loan any time for any reason.  Technically,  they can call the loan back even if the stocks are in the green - they won't do so since there's no point.  Keep in mind they also loan out your shares for a profit.  Forcing you to sell your shares is also take away this profit revenue. 

To properly make the call, you should always keep both views in mind:  what's in it for you and what's in it for them.

Taking the concept a step further.  When the wealthy buy insurance,  they don't sit there compare plans to see which one is $200/year cheaper.  They look at the plan in the view point that if the perfect storm hits, which plan prevents them from going bankrupt.

I have a credit score of 800+, over 200K in investable assets, and most of it in liquid index funds. I also have over 30k in cash in an emergency fund. Using 14k margin is not going to bankrupt me.

By all means, using a margin loan at 1.57% seems like a no-brainer for me. I might even use it to buy a house in the future, instead of going the traditional mortagage route. IBKR uses the Federal Funds Rate (FFR) as its benchmark and adds a little extra for their cut. The last time that the FFR was at 3%, which is where mortgage rates are today, was like in peak 2007.

This only my opinion, but I would open a low cost broker add 1000 in it, and not top up for at least a year.

Use % to see if investing for you. A 100 dollar gain may not be alot, but it 10% gain, which is great. 

Only reason I think that is the way to go, is for me once I started investing, I started to read about the market and notice any news related to markets.

322,NAV," A mutual fund has a mandate to invest to a specific strategy. An active fund tries to beat it‚Äôs specified benchmark, a passive fund may try to replicate the performance of it‚Äôs benchmark or generate absolute returns.

An ETF has a lower expense because they don‚Äôt perform any active analysis to find potential investments. You, the ETF and everyone knows the composition of the S&P500, so they can run the fund on lower expenses. On the other hand, active funds (both ETFs and mutual funds) charge a higher fee since they spend more resources on analysing companies. Similar to mutual funds, ETFs have a specific mandate, but they tend to be passive i.e. try to replicate an index/benchmark.

ETFs are traded on an exchange (it‚Äôs in the name), while mutual funds are not. When you buy into a mutual fund, you buy units at the closing NAV (which you don‚Äôt know at the time of the order); on the other hand there is a market price for ETFs at which you can trade.",simonkesterlian,5,/r/stocks/comments/mteqz3/index_fund_vs_mutual_funds_vs_etfindi_stocks/guz8rac/,0.018,0.892,0.089,0.8847

But, as I like it long term, started a small position. It is in a highly competitive field, with SE growing its food delivery and Tokopedia Gojek competing in ride hailing and other services.

In short, while I like the company, they have some excellent competition and a very competitive road ahead of them.

But SEA is a growth region, Vietnam and Indonesia alone make it worth the risk.

367,DCF," Buy low, sell high. (alot easier said than done)

Dont daytrade, invest in quality stocks and HOLD

dont buy speculative garbage, buy some VTI/MSFT etc for majority of your portfolio, slow and steady wins the race

be diversified, dont put all your money into Tech stocks cause when a correction comes your portfolio will hurt, alot of people were panicking when this happened like last month. Have Financials, Energy, Utilities, Tech, Industrials etc. 

take reddit opinions with a grain of salt

Dont pay for any services like Motley fool etc, no matter how good it sounds its all bullshit.

Learn how to analyze financial statements, read the investors page on the companies website in which you are trying to invest in. Also if you really want to get serious learn things like DCF in order to valuate companies better.

GME had an insane short interest combined with a natural run up in it's stock price, combined with the shorts doubling down on the way up.
