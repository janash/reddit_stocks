26,NYC," Assuming the government isn't taking their skim, or confiscating your property, on paper it sounds like a \*great\* idea. Then again, I could say the same about most scams.

You're talking a 100% population growth in 20 years - that's like 4% CAGR. Nigerian currency could easily get weaker against the Euro over the next 20 years, offsetting any capital gains, still getting taxed, and ultimately lowering your return. US stock market averages a 10% CAGR in comparison (7-8% after inflation). 

Given the choice, I'd much rather invest in LA/SF/NYC/Seattle real estate than Nigeria. As a 2nd choice, any diversified US REIT fund is fine, or large REITs that focus on renting homes/apartments across the country. Just me.

The best two options to accomplish your goal of being exposed to the global economy are A) buy every stock in the world weighted by market cap (like VT) and B) buy every stock in the world equally weighted (not sure off top of my head if there is a nice ETF for this).

33,GDP," What this indicates is that more of the US GDP is represented in publicly investable companies than China.

It doesn't matter what China's GDP is, you can still only invest in their public companies.

The Chinese [State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State-owned_Assets_Supervision_and_Administration_Commission) is the largest economic entity in the world, dwarfing the likes of Apple or Amazon, but you can't invest in it. What you are doing increasing the % of China is increasing the % of the other stuff (AliBaba, Tencent, etc) that you *can* invest in. You aren't actually capturing ""Chinese GDP"" in a meaningful way.

It's also worth noting here that GDP growth does not typically correlate well with stock market growth.

>Several studies (Dimson et al. [2002], Ritter [2005]) have examined whether countries with higher
long-run real GDP growth also had higher long-run real stock market return. The surprising result
was contrary to expectations -- the correlation between stock returns and economic growth
across countries can be negative!

38,OUT," Want to see if this makes any sense and my math is correct. I am planning a rollover from an old employer's 401k to new employer's 401k as fees increased in the old employer's plan and would like everything under one account for simplicity. The old plan is essentially in VTI.

To mitigate out of market time risk I understand I could purchase call options on VTI that are either just in the money or just slightly out of the money so if the market keeps going up while the funds are in transit to the new plan I would at least profit off the options. Meanwhile if the market goes down I do lose the amount I paid in premium for the calls but I also gain the buying the funds with in the new plan at a reduced cost. To calculate the number of contracts to buy, would I just take the number of shares I currently have in VT/100? Basically, should I match the amount of currently held shares to contract shares?

Is there any benefit to going just IN or OUT of the money on the calls for this scenario?

Am I overthinking this and should just do the rollover and hope for a market pullback and/or quick delivery?

I did already check and in-kind transfer is not an option. Has to be check to me and forwarding check to new 401k unfortunately.",Ccardmaven,1,/r/investing/comments/msncop/daily_advice_thread_all_basic_help_or_advice/guw4mtu/,0.027,0.846,0.127,0.9706
