416,CTXR," Key points: ‚ÄúFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell speaks twice to Congress this week as part of mandated semiannual testimony.

Normally nonevents for the market, the central bank leader‚Äôs comments will be viewed closely this week for how he views this year‚Äôs run-up in bond yields.

Investors worry that too quick of a rise might force the Fed to tighten policy too quickly, while a complacent Fed also would pose overheating risks.‚Äù

There are lots of reasons for the market to be red, but I think there‚Äôs a lot of anxiety surrounding Powell‚Äôs testimony. I predict it will be a bit rocky until he speaks. After that it‚Äôs either going to be bloody or beautiful.

I exited some of my more risky positions when they were looking nice and green this morning. Sold CTXR when it popped. I like the stock, but hoping to catch it again when it cools off down the line.

501,DD," well i also bought in the news last time(big mistake) Got in @3.1 and seeing it was going to downtrend within the 30 minutes it popped i bought more and averaged down. And then after eleven days which was yesterday, it dropped down to 1.8 Premarket and seriously considered to take the loss and get out. However i hesitated because i really do like their pipeline. I actually really liked their ovarian cancer treatment project(my mom suffered from complications). And while i was there not sure what to do, pull out?yes or no? BOOM i see it explode out of nowhere. I did sell 80% at 3.2 and 3.4 but i‚Äôm buying more when it goes down, which it will seeing the chart. there are more chances to go up again now that it has FDA fast track. Every new news article they hit a higher ceiling so i think next time we could hope for 3.5-4! I am not a financial adviser, just a person who is bored and very new to the game.

502,EVFM, These small change stocks move for bs reasons. Some have real news others.... well they get some hype. If there was FDA news and the stock popped but now dropped back down sounds like the movement went according with the market redness. FDA approval is never a guarantee for a stock to keep moving higher and higher. Perfect example EVFM... they got approval on their female contraceptive product and the stock went south. Now it's moving a little higher but def not a levels people expected and many said over $7 easily.,DeepBuddy5,1,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/lq7s1v/clsn_situation/gof8ry8/,0.02,0.776,0.204,0.9645
