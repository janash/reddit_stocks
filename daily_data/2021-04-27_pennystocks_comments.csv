9,DD," I think there's a lot of HITI holders on /r/pennystocks (myself included). And I think a lot of that is to do with two things:

1. It's a straight forward stock/company. A lot of pennystocks are either pharmaceutical companies, mining (or oil) companies or complicated tech. As I have no affinity with any of those, I don't know why I should invest in them. I can understand the DD, the product, the medicine, whatever - but I still can't make a judgement for myself wether or not it's good. With High Tide, I think nobody really has that problem. It's about as straight forward as it gets.
2. On top of that, it has good fundamentals and really looks like a good investment. Not a swing trade or big betting gamble or anything like that.

I mention all this because that's why I've seen HITI mentioned when I have. In DD for completely unrelated pennystocks people will pop up in the comments and say: ""Pfsh. If you want a company with good fundamentals, look at hiti"".

11,UAL," Cause I have been posting this here for the last two months and this aspect have been discussed multiple times. 

It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here is the average across all the comments. 

[here](http://imgur.com/gallery/vyg92Nz) is a sample of the sentiment analysis I posted when Boeing's engine failed on UAL flight. 

Is it 100% accurate? No! The program misses out of nuanced sarcasm.

13,MIND," While not a ban investment, there’s tens of psychedelic companies that are already profitable and the market cap is only tens of millions.

Champignons, Cybin, and LOBE for example.

14,MNMD," If you plan to stay in MNMD until it at least doubles, you'll make way more money buying MindMed **warrants.**

I favor the one expiring in 2024, with stock symbol **MMDCF.**

Here's a brief explanation, with rounded figures for ease of understanding:

MNMD is currently ~$5/share. MMDCF is ~$1.50/share.

MMDCF has an exercise price ~$5.50. Translation: Buying one unit of MMDCF = buying the right to buy a share of MNMD for $5.50.

Suppose you spend $15 today on MMED (3 shares) and $15 on MMDCF (10 shares). Time passes and MNMD reaches $10/share. Here's your profit margin:

**MNMD:** $5 shares now worth $10 -> your 3 shares are worth $30  (**100% profit**, 2x orig investment)

**MMDCF:** each warrant lets you buy a share worth $10 by paying $5.50 on top of your initial $1.50, for a total profit of $3. You don't actually have to lay out the cash to exercise; you can just sell the warrants to someone else. So your $1.50 shares are now worth $4.50 -> your 10 shares are worth $45 (**200% profit**, 3x orig investment)

The higher the share price ends up, the better the multiplier. And the lower you share price when you buy, the better the multiplier.

Since options aren't currently available, warrants are the next-best thing, and probably the best thing outright if you're looking to invest for a year or longer.

MMDCF is good. This is not financial advice.",jleonardbc,4,/r/pennystocks/comments/mziio5/extensive_dd_on_mindmed_mnmd_a_psychedelicbased/gw2kfv9/,0.008,0.786,0.205,0.9917

16,IMO," IMO this will take *years* to come to fruition. But once it does, you'll be thanking your lucky stars you invested ASAP. 

AFAIK psychedelics are the only drugs known to potentially **cure** mental illnesses rather than just treat them, though they *can also* treat them.

While there's no guarantee that this company will be at the forefront in ten years- *some* company will, and this seems to be the only tangible way to invest into psychedelic medicine.",This_is_your_mind,1,/r/pennystocks/comments/mziio5/extensive_dd_on_mindmed_mnmd_a_psychedelicbased/gw2qqyg/,0.078,0.777,0.146,0.7351

Even microdosing I still question the overall profit.

32,USA," Well, I agree on the microdosing profit margin thing. Except for the fact that you could charge much more retail value selling pre capsule micro doses in a jar with a fancy label vs say ounces to people just looking to have a good time. And also, we have yet to really see how much therapeutical potential on a large scale there is considering it’s been illegal all these years. But yes, I think for a company to really see profit with psychedelics you would need to have a multi faceted approach, I think you have to be thinking bigger than retail. It’s really going to be about the therapeutical value, mental health, ptsd healing, etc. 

I mean think about the amount of money people pay to go do ayahuasca retreats down in the jungle. What if you could do that in your backyard? How many more people would be on board? At best, we’re looking at a complete revolutionary approach to the way we deal with mental health, pharmaceuticals, etc. (heavy emphasis on the “at best”)

Ibogaine, for instance, has incredible potential for a country ravaged by an opiate epidemic such as the USA. Of course, right now they would put you under the jail if you were caught with that stuff.

80,FL," Upon federal legalization the cannabis industry is expected to soar over $100 billion annually.  Medmen is continuing to add more retail locations.  They are in one of the few MSOs licensed to operate in NY, which is now legal recreationally.  They are looking to add 6 more retail locations in FL (which hasn't even legalized recreationally yet).  Their highest revenue generation retail location is in IL where they just added a second dispensary.  And I might add that IL continues to set record sales each month.  

And let's talk about the value of the cannabis licenses that they own.  While I can't speak for other states, here in IL cannabis licenses are valued anywhere between $30 million to $50 million.  If that can be considered a nationwide average, that gives Medmen over $1 billion in just licenses alone.  They add more retail locations and 

Keep in mind, like so many companies they took a hit with Covid.  But things have changed for them in a big way.  Cannabis has been deemed an essential business and when delivery became an option for them it definitely helped.  Their FY2021 began June 30, 2020.  And since then they have had 2 positive cash flow  quarters.  Now that the country is opening back up, those numbers will continue to rise.

82,AWH," They are already ahead of schedule on turning things around as their Q1 and Q2 numbers have shown.  The old CEO is long gone and their current CEO has a proven track record.  And let's not forget that a lot of MSOs are carrying a lot of debt.  Because cannabis is still illegal federally, they haven't been able to access traditional institutional funds.  That will change with the passage of the SAFE Banking act.  Additionally, the deal they made with AWH for the NY operations allowed them to shave $75 million off of their debt.

Hard to believe that two different hedge funds would purchase over 128 million shares within the last 30 days if they are showing signs of getting the business on the right track.  Time will tell but I'm very optimistic about their growth potential.  

Furthermore, I'm not sure if people are paying attention to this but the new name of this cannabis game is M&A.  Companies like Cresco Labs, Curaleaf, Verano and even smaller MSOs like Red, White and Bloom and AWH are buying up smaller companies left and right.  Also, look at companies like Sundial and Hexo.  Sundial has over $800 million in cash lying around while Hexo announced they are raising $960 million.  Pretty sure they have intentions on trying to buy their way into the US market.  Other Canadian MSOs have also mentioned the possibility of trying to do the same.  Sure makes Medmen more attractive IMO.

One last thing, let's give some value to the many cannabis licenses they currently own.  Here in IL, we have valued each cannabis license as being worth anywhere between $30 million to $50 million each.  They are extremely hard to come by with a very long and difficult application process.  So let me paint a picture.  I'm a VC who wants in on the cannabis industry upon national legalization.  How would I go about it?  To apply for licenses (which is also very expensive), build out facilities and get things up and running could easily take 12 to 24 months.  Hell, for a cultivation facility, add another 4 months minimum to that for the first crop to be produced (from seed to flower).  As a VC, I would be at a huge disadvantage because all of the other MSOs are solidified in their respective markets.  So what would make more sense?  Try to apply for licenses all over the country, wait for approval, then get started OR look at potential companies to acquire that are already up and running?  I'm looking at a bigger picture here.  If Medmen can continue to move things in the right direction and with their national branding, they become a very attractive business for potential acquisition.

Here in IL, their retail location in Oak Park, IL did over $15 million in revenue in 2020 making it their highest grossing dispensary in the country.  They just added a second dispensary in Morton Grove, IL.

MetaMaterials ($MMATF) is a promising company on the OTC, focusing on Aerospace, Defense, Auto, and Electronics. They have some solid contracts and IMHO just a very bright future long term. They are trying to uplift to the nasdaq, and decided to merge with Torchlight to do so. Torchlight has a large swath of land in Texas that they plan to liquidate for capital in the merger, which would allow MMATF to uplist and the remaining capital would go to shareholders in the form of a Special Dividend. Speculation on this dividend ranges from $.20/share to $20/share. I have 1500 shares, so it’s basically free money. On the 30th of this month TRCH votes whether they want to merge and then the merger will commence I believe in May and it will get up listed soon after.

133,SO," IPO’s will all do this now because they aren’t popular anymore mostly. Since there are SO MANY IPO’s these investors have pick of whatever they want, way more supply than demand. 

As for uplisting MANY people who hold shares (especially insiders) want to make some money and take some profits on a stock they have been holding for YEARS. They couldn’t sell anything while waiting to uplist because that looks really really bad. The other investors some have been holding since .04 cents when it hits damn near $7 you  sell. 

It won’t stay down forever I’m sure those people holding forever didn’t exit the position just sold some which can start a slide down. 

That’s just my opinion

134,AT," So uplisting is a very different dynamic than IPOs, but the IPO process literally CAUSES IPOs to trade much higher than where they price, and there is an instant transfer of value to select institutions....

**TL;DR - Banks make IPO go brrrrr. Hedgies make money. Stock goes down.** 

*If you care to learn about the \*flawed\* IPO process... keep reading...* 

The first thing a company does when it wants to IPO is go to a bank to be the bookrunner on the deal (sometimes they pick a few bookrunners). Then those banks go around and gauge interest in the stock to see where they should price the shares. 

Seems reasonable right? WRONG. 

What happens when they go to price shares is they typically have this internal target of a subscription of AT LEAST 97%. That means that of all the institutions and hedge funds they talk to, they are hoping to price the IPO such that 97% of them say that they'd be willing to buy the stock at that price. Think HOW LOW you would have to price an IPO for 97% of people to want to buy it at that price (basic supply and demand suggests that is extremely low). 

So what ends up happening is that the bank ends up picking their best/favorite clients to receive allocations in the actual IPO that is already priced too low... They fill a book and sell those IPO shares to hedge funds and institutions at this super low price... but then a lot of the time the stock never even trades there. 

So the company that IPOs sells their shares at $5/shr for 100mm shares and raises $500mm... but the second the market opens there is such a huge demand for shares at that low of a price that the banks have caused this super distorted supply/demand picture and the stock rips up to $10/shr, $20/shr, $30/shr... and now the company that IPO'ed through the bank only got $500mm when their stock is now worth $1bn++... all that ""wealth creation"" went straight into the hands of hedgies and other shareholders and not to the company.

Then after the buzz wears off ... the stock usually slumps a few hours/days later.

What makes it even more sad is that it never made hikes after that where I coulda just sold off and bought in again later.  The trade volume was HIGH which is what made 0 sense to me.
