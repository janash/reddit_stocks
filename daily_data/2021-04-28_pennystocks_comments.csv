9,BIO," I don't completely agree. Although I can't prove it of course, it seems like most of the recent price fluctuations were in response to news/events happening. I made a comment obout this a while back, I'll copy paste part of it here:

This stock seems to be moving quite a bit on the news that is released lately.

If you look at the three month chart there is a massive drop in December 2020, which followed after the press release that the phase III trial on SGX942 was unsuccessfull.

Then in January 2021 news came out that Soligenix would host a webcast event on the commercialisation of SGX301, which was followed by a small price increase.

Finally there was a small price surge around 18 February, just after news was made public that Soligenix would present at the 2021 BIO & CEO Investor Digital Conference (news was released Feb 11th, Conference was held Feb 16-18th).

Of course the news and the price changes could be completely unrelated, no way to prove or debunk this, but I personally do find it reassuring to myself that there seems to be a clarification for recent price fluctuations and I like it when a stock at least seems to respond to the news/cataclysts that it gets.

So basically that's why I personally don't think it's been pumped, but like I said in the comment: The news and fluctuations could be completely unrelated, there is no way to prove or disprove this.

I’ve been doing well with penny stocks in the last month or so. I’ve been investing for about 8 years, and I never really looked at penny stocks until recently. It’s been a lot of fun, however I’m getting most of my news from Reddit, YouTube, and general google searches for DD.

Could anyone point me to a few good resources to expand my knowledge and ability to find penny stocks a little bit earlier? I’ve been having a blast with this trading CBDD, HITIF, and EEENF. I have some long term holdings I’m looking to take profit on soon and I’d like to reinvest these into more penny stocks.
