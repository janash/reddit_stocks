53,GME," This article is misleading and misses an important factor.

&#x200B;

Most hedge funds leverage and make money from option market. Hedge funds are by far the biggest winners in the past and they have been the biggest winners since 2020 march crash. Sure some hedge funds who didn't manage properly might have taken a hit but overall hedge funds are winning big. Even citadel did well. The GME saga with citadel was planned by hedge funds. Hedge funds are the biggest winners win GME, not retail. The saga was marketed to suck in more retail suckers into the game. Big boys are making killing writing options. For the hedge funds or a good investor, if you pick decent stocks, you will make money regardless of which way the stock moves if you learn the derivative market.  Most retail or regular investors are conditioned to believe that only way to make money in the market is buy buying the dips and holding until the stock price gains....hedge funds and big boys don't want the retail to learn about collecting premium from options. Instead they want the retail to just buy/sell stocks or play (gamble) naked options.  I highly recommend reading the quarterly previews from ""Betting Resource"" to get the scope of the market each quarter and to get some under the radar stocks before they start bull run.

54,IMO," The public perception of hedge funds is considerably wrong IMO. Firstly, majority of hedge funds don‚Äôt benchmark their performance against the S&P, so just comparing the returns of the two and making a conclusion would be dumb. The main goal of a hedge fund is to achieve a certain hurdle rate while having a low level of volatility. They make investors feel comfortable knowing that no matter what happens in the market, their investment will be swinging much less than the said benchmark.

88,AI," Ok and tell me precisely what does Clov actually do that makes their growth potential huge.  Their entire business model is predicated on some revolutionary ai assistant that you literally cannot find a single thing about how it operates online.  The only reviews you have from it come from the hindenburg report which we can disregard because that's probably cherry picking of the data.  What isn't is that they pay doctors to use it.  So we have a product that is only in use because people are paid to use it which ok you've got to implement it somehow but I find it really really odd that there is absolutely no reviews on how the fucking thing works.  So maybe its amazon in the making but it could just as easily be another Theranos and given the similar makeup of the companies as to having people that have absolutely no medical experience but are famous in political circles on their board I'm more of leaning it's another Theranos

>care about regulating Wall Street, climate change, and income inequality. 

regulation of WS would just move citadel business back to major banks which kinda phased out of it after 2008 crisis. yeah nothing screams about income inequality than making Blackrock buy up all RE they can

unless you ban all other crypto from trading what good it would do? at best this would be another stable coin asset for corps to buy into.

158,RNG," From Q&A with CEO Andrew Littlefair when asked about infrastructure bill

‚ÄúAnd so come this year, there were some United States senators on the Republican side with some Democrat colleagues, in fact, Chairman Brown that just felt like the low -- No-Low program should return to the original legislative tent, which is that if you could put help fund low NOx buses, especially using RNG on the road which have arguably a lower carbon content than electric, that, that should get put in place. And so when you look at the plus ups, so the low, No-Low program has gone from -- on the order of a couple of hundred million bucks a year to $5 billion, right, $5.25 billion. There's a 25% carve-out of that $5.25 billion for low NOx buses, which would be natural gas buses.

So it's a big -- for me, it's a big recognition, and it's a carve-out, right? It's solid. So you got $1 billion basically there that's going to be for natural gas buses. And so we're real pleased about that. And when you kind of compare that versus the other $3 billion that's going to go to electric, you're going to get on a bus on bus comparison, you'll have about as many natural gas buses funded as you will electric.

226,IMO," SENS is working on iCGM designation now for pump integration. They‚Äôll get it. Think about the autonomous-artificial pancreas. A critical part of that is a CGM. Do you think the future of the artificial pancreas is a transcutaneous CGM like Dex or Libre that has to be changed every couple of weeks? One more thing to manage and fall off when bumped, swimming or exercising. Meanwhile, in a few years SENS will have a 365 day sensor that other than an annual implant won‚Äôt require any regular maintenance. It will speak directly to the pump without wearing a patch or transmitter like Dex. That is a powerful technology and a level of freedom that can‚Äôt be achieved by the transcutaneous CGMs that will regularly need to be managed and changed (because of the open wound they create).

I spent 7 years working for one of the largest insurance companies in the world. Sure coverage is a hurdle but insurance companies want 2 things - 1) adherent diabetics managing their condition and 2) long term cost savings. SENS can demonstrate both. Which will increase as the sensor lifespan increases. 

To your point in the near term. I‚Äôll agree that the 180 product and the surgical implant will be a barrier for some. That‚Äôs fine, not everyone will want SENS. But I believe enough type 1s will see the advantage for SENS to take a piece of the market. SENS doesn‚Äôt need to steal every Dexcom customer to win, it won‚Äôt.

231,SAVA," Comments from a SAVA shareholder, with medicine/biochemistry knowledge, as to why I have taken a small-to-medium stake, and will likely to continue to add to the position:

* Alzheimer costs the world an estimated trillion dollars a year. What is the market cap for something that can either reverse it or slow it meaningfully enough that the sufferers pass from other natural causes? My impression is that it is more than the $\~3.8B market cap of SAVA.
* It is a focused play. Their test for Alzheimer, while mild interesting, is not enough for me to invest. I feel it is the treatment that is the value. They own their drug outright, with no partners yet to dilute. There are no other big hopes-and-wishes in the SAVA pipeline for me to have to review and speculate upon. And really, doing any early stage pipeline stuff of something else would be not in anyone's interests if it takes away time from what they already have now.
* I reviewed the Eli Lilly data, and the Biogen data of their candidates and am underwhelmed with both. Side effects like brain swelling are a hurdle, making one like SAVA that seems safe so far, open to adoption. I feel that the SAVA drug if confirmed by phase 3, will be a blockbuster. 
* SAVA's last attempt at a drug, Remoxy, shows that the executive team knows the approval system and can get something to late stages. The politics of the time (an opioid that is less abuse-resistant) alas ended up being right at the time when OxyContin suits were underway from a drug that was marketed as less abuse resistant, followed by lawsuits about contribution to an opioid crisis. So I don't think that FDA people wanted to wade into that lawsuit crossfire by approving Remoxy, even though looking at the data, I feel it probably was less abuse-resistant than existing competitors at the time. Conversely, the current politics is that Alzheimer treatment is very political friendly: seniors go vote, Alzheimer costs taxpayers a lot, and Alzheimer devastates entire families. A viable cure is one that nearly everyone would want as part of their legacy, as seen by Biogen that was waived through without as compelling as results as seen by SAVA's. So if phase 3 works out, I feel it will be a go from FDA for SAVA.
* Finance snapshot for SAVA is around $200M in the bank and zero debt. I feel phase 3 trial price will be under that, on the latest conference call there was a side comment of $100M. Pretty thin expenses otherwise since already have the drug candidate built just need to test it. However, they will be having to hire a lot of folks each year if things go well, and started with spending $21.9M in cash to pick up two buildings for housing everyone ([10-Q statement last week, search the document for 'building'](https://sec.report/Document/0001069530-21-000045/)).  The conference call also suggests to expect a non-dilutive infusion of cash from someone interested in curing Alzheimer. My best guess would be the the NIH (National Institute of Health) since they granted SAVA in past, with dark horse bets on the Gates Foundation due to past history, and 10,000:1 odds on Julianne Moore (got Oscar for Still Alice, a movie about Alzheimer).

Caveats: Not an advisor and certainly not your advisor. Biotech is high-risk, high-reward, and Alzheimer in particular has burned so many billions of R&D that many publicly listed drug firms simply quit trying. SAVA as an all-in bet on Alzheimer cure/treatment in particular is either penthouse suite or cardboard box.

When I've looked into market tops I've found timing is fucking hard.  Even when these levels are forecasting the right price for you to watch even ""Knowing"" the market was making a high could have got your puts nailed because it hangs about doing nothing for a long time sometimes.

In a linked post in the one above with my positions I did a detailed breakdown of what I think the optimum strategy is. Selling call spreads ATM and buying OTM. I did this one SPY, RUT and various big blue chips (AAPL, MSFT etc).  If the market slows down and ranges I'll do okay on my short calls and lose the cheaper puts - but if there's some sort of ""Shock"" in the market and everything moves, these can see big IV jumps.",HoleyProfit,14,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p08vzd/why_i_think_a_spx_high_soon_is_possible/h851w2w/,0.023,0.939,0.038,0.2967

If protest is dismissed it will be Good for both Oshkosh and Microvast. I‚Äôm not a lawyer but the USPS/Oshkosh argument sounds solid. Workhorse broke rules, then sued saying rules were wrong.

‚ÄúBy filing this protest, Workhorse is telling the Court and the parties that the normal rules do not apply to Workhorse. This is wrong. Workhorse, like any other company that wants to do business with the USPS, is required to complete the USPS‚Äôs mandatory disagreement process before going to Court. Workhorse failed to do so here, and the Court should, therefore, dismiss‚Äù ‚àøOshkosh lawyer",Spiritual_Exchange47,5,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p0lj8x/on_the_infrastructure_bill_and_how_i_see_it_going/h87mty7/,0.152,0.764,0.084,-0.9531

381,DK," So, while you might be right on almost all of it and will still moon, I think you, them and others overestimate their Sports betting revenue.

Let me try to explain why:
- building a sports betting product ground up takes about 2-3 years.
- they have market access online on a limited number of states, which are already mature and where the big boys already run it.
- PA for example had an outrageous tax rate, 40%.
- while customer acquisition might be easier/cheaper, from 1M subscribers, not sure they will be able to convert 10%, which is not a lot. BetMGM, DK, FanDuel have already millions of users
- usability, I know the regulations quite well and I can tell you it will be damn hard to provider proper customer journeys.
- others already tried it (Google PlayUp tv integration) and it went tits up.
- new entrants in the market tend not to do well, look at Barstool, so much hype, millions of stoolies and they barely scratch the market.

I‚Äôm pretty sure they will need to acquire someone from the industry to really compete in this space.

Again, you plan looks solid but don‚Äôt think that gambling will make this moon. It might moon on the news but no on the results.
