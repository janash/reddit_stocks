TL;DR:

> We see several key inflection points upcoming in 2021. AD has already kicked off selling Eversence from October, and our attention is focused on the number of new users that AD can drive for the device. Currently only in a 90 day form, SENS is anticipating FDA approval for a 180 day device in 1H 2021. This aligns perfectly with AD's strategy to expand the total territories under their network (from 10 to 25), and AD has basically all of the commercial rights under this agreement. Management have guided ~$2.5 million in top-line earnings for Q4, and they have also opened a $12 million dilutive line of credit for next year. Whilst this does impact shareholders, the additional liquidity will strengthen the balance sheet and provide a meaningful option for cash injection for productivity. Thus, the upcoming focus for us is on the approval of the 180 day device approval from the FDA, and SENS are also intending to introduce a 180 day version with reduced calibration for CE Mark approval in the EU. Following on from this, SENS will commence its trials for the 365 day version of the product. We see potential IDE approval for this coming in early next year, where pivotal and late phase trialing can begin later in 2021. Again, this would add another level of depth the skew of revenues, allowing the income from product sales to dovetail further in time. Thus, these are certainly upcoming catalysts that may drive shares north in the coming periods.",0.0,0.85,0.15,0.9894

1. A 5 day window begins where the sending bank tells the receiving bank that the funds are good. The sending bank can actually say ""Yes they are good"" then come back and say ""No funds are no good"" and pull it back with in that window - unless you have a track record no receiving bank will approve funds during this window
2. Once the 5 business days have passed and funds are good, payout to receiving bank is created
3. That payout then takes the normal 2 business days to process into your account

Robinhood is also incentivized to do this to encourage you to sign up for RH Gold where the instant transfer limit is equal to whatever your current balance is, up to $50k. So if you have $32,400 in your account, you can instant transfer up to that same amount.

CTRM went public during the worst time for the shipping industry which explains its slow downfall. If you take a look at other maritime companies, you can see around the same time they also had slumps in general. this is due to a drop in the BDI Index. Now on the other hand, that index is up now. along with that the company has not solid financials + 7 ships. Volume is really high, earnings reports are coming soon, this is good for both a flip and a long hold. In regards to the offerings, its not nothing new under the sun. their offerings went well and were direct offerings rather than public ones. also they've quickly used the cash to purchase their 7th ship. its not like its sitting there doing nothing.",0.061,0.888,0.051,-0.1416

This is a cheap stock that has a lot of upside.  COVID made the market they operate in depressed, but with vaccines now in play and their expanded/updated fleet of shipping vessels Castor now has, the upside is there for Castor to capitalize and get some charter agreements for shipping into 2021.  The risk:  A reverse split or worse since there’s about 5 months left to get to 10 days at or above $1 for NASDAQ.

Through August 2019, they had 1 boat.  They now have a fleet of boats.  Notably, they took delivery of two boats in mid-October 2020 (the Magic Nova and the Magic Horizon).  Just looking at that, it’s either a hail-Mary or it’s because they are onto something.  Also adding to 2020, they were working on doing dry-dock updates to their boats in 2020 (see p. 42 of the 20-F), so downtime/turnaround/upgrades mean a smaller fleet to ship stuff and generate revenue.  This can be looked at two ways:  1) bad timing or 2) they timed it perfectly to have boats out of the water and doing updates done when the market was garbage anyway.

Certainly, with a lot of new shares that’ve been issued (December 2020 and January 2021) in the past couple months, there’s some dilution of the value of the shares.  But that also means they are sitting on a bucket of cash (something like $38M) and the stocks are cheap.
