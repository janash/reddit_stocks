If you turn that same $10K into $100K, the $90K in gains is taxable (the ‚Äòoriginal‚Äô $10K won‚Äôt be double taxed).

To your last question, yes, losses offset gains when you do your taxes at the end of the year. If you gained a total of $100K on your positive trades, but lost $25K on your loss trades, you‚Äôd owe on $75K. If all of the trades made were on securities held less than a year, it‚Äôd be taxed at your income rate.",0.071,0.761,0.168,0.9201
98,ZOM,"As far as I'm aware, you're only taxed on total gains (gains - losses), not just gains. Any time you make any kind of profit, you should expect a tax of some sort. It's usually commutative, so they'll calculate total tax in the tax form they (your broker) sends you at tax season. If you happen to have net losses, you usually are able to claim it back in taxes.


To answer your questions:

1) Even if you don't pull out the money, yes, you get taxed. As soon as you sell your holding, that money is calculated towards taxes.

2) Yes, even if you reinvest the money, the gain you made from ZOM would be taxed regardless. It will be taxed the same even if you reinvest the gain.

3) If you start with 5000 and profit 5K for a 10K total, then reinvest the 10K and make 90K for a 100K total, your total profit is 5K + 90K = 95K. That 95K is taxed. 

4) You are taxed on the difference, like I said before. Total Gains - Total Losses = Net Profit/Net Loss.


Edit: The best way to ""avoid"" annual/consecutive taxes is to trade using a Roth IRA account. If you want the specifics, you can Google what that is but the gist of it is that you are not taxed on your profits using an IRA account until you actually pull the money out of the account.",0.022,0.866,0.113,0.9486

2. We have a bunch of new mutations and we're still not 100% sure which vaccines will take care of which strains

LNG isn't a popular industry right now.
