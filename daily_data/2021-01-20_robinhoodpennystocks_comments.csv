97,ZOM,"Taxes are based on net gains at the end of the year across all your trades.

If you sell ZOM for $10K, but immediately reinvest it elsewhere, that $10K is taxable.

If you turn that same $10K into $100K, the $90K in gains is taxable (the ‘original’ $10K won’t be double taxed).

To your last question, yes, losses offset gains when you do your taxes at the end of the year. If you gained a total of $100K on your positive trades, but lost $25K on your loss trades, you’d owe on $75K. If all of the trades made were on securities held less than a year, it’d be taxed at your income rate.",0.071,0.761,0.168,0.9201
98,ZOM,"As far as I'm aware, you're only taxed on total gains (gains - losses), not just gains. Any time you make any kind of profit, you should expect a tax of some sort. It's usually commutative, so they'll calculate total tax in the tax form they (your broker) sends you at tax season. If you happen to have net losses, you usually are able to claim it back in taxes.


To answer your questions:

1) Even if you don't pull out the money, yes, you get taxed. As soon as you sell your holding, that money is calculated towards taxes.

2) Yes, even if you reinvest the money, the gain you made from ZOM would be taxed regardless. It will be taxed the same even if you reinvest the gain.

3) If you start with 5000 and profit 5K for a 10K total, then reinvest the 10K and make 90K for a 100K total, your total profit is 5K + 90K = 95K. That 95K is taxed. 

4) You are taxed on the difference, like I said before. Total Gains - Total Losses = Net Profit/Net Loss.


Edit: The best way to ""avoid"" annual/consecutive taxes is to trade using a Roth IRA account. If you want the specifics, you can Google what that is but the gist of it is that you are not taxed on your profits using an IRA account until you actually pull the money out of the account.",0.022,0.866,0.113,0.9486

1. The vaccines aren't generating huge amounts of income right now. They're crazy expensive to ship and store, and they're being bought and sold pretty much at price so that every state can vaccinate everyone for as close to free as possible. (This is where $TNXP could actually shine)

2. We have a bunch of new mutations and we're still not 100% sure which vaccines will take care of which strains

3. Vaccines will only reach maximum efficacy if people at scale comply with them. Right now, the rate of people who qualify for the vaccine is growing faster than the rate of people vaccinated. That's going to make investors nervous.",0.082,0.79,0.128,0.795

LNG isn't a popular industry right now.

501,DD,"Tesla is up 25% in just a month, and that's just one company. A stock being a penny stock or not has very little to do with it swinging massively, it has to do with the current and future value of the company. It's rare to find the ""lucky buy"" on market open and sell at the end of the day for huge profit. Penny stockers lose money because they have hands made of aerogel and literally can't hold for shit. Do your DD and quit complaining.

If you really think there's going to be a massive swing difference between a stock at $0.25 and one at $2.50, you need to go back to Economics 101.",0.037,0.854,0.109,0.8327
502,TSLA,"5$ only comes in on select instances when the OTC variation matters- so while in some instances the penny stock can be 5$ or less, in 99% of OTC, it is less than 1$.
