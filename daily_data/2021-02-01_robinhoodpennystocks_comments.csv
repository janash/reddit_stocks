25,CEO," I would agree with CTRM Castro. I’ve watched the board meetings for investors and the timing is great.  Biden and Obama  allowed other countries economy to grow by trade.  Shipping companies from Greece made a killing. Look up SHIP and TOPS then see the 10 year history. 15 mill per share.  19 mill per share. Shipping containers from China and oil from Middle East. SHIP and TOPS had fallen because the new presidency tightening up trade agreements. No pumping on fed land, no more pipeline, what’s next? History will repeat with trade agreements and shipping will be waiting. 
Most shipping companies have 9-12 ships and has had to file bankruptcy or seeked financial help.

239,ONE," Setrok Movement

What

\-  Setrok is an entity with no political, religious, ethnic, sexual, or social motivation. The sole focus of the Setrok Movement is to aid in empowering “We the People” utilizing social influence and herd mentality. The objective is to regain some level of control and power over a system that has little concern for the fiscal success of The People.

\-  Unlike banks, advisors, investment firms, Wall Street, etc., Setrok has no desire or need to benefit from the participants of the Movement. Setrok is an entity designed for The People and only exists act as a reference point for those participating in the movement.

How

\-  Setrok will pick words/phrases/pictures that represent things that have been researched and determined to best benefit the interests of We the People.

\-  Setrok will post a word/phrase/picture with the acronym B.U.Y.

\-  Setrok will wait at least 12 hours, but up to six days, and post the same word/phrase/picture with the acronym S.E.L.L.

\-  Setrok will wait at least 10 hours, but up to four days, to repeat with a different word/phrase/picture with the acronym B.U.Y.

\-  The success of the Setrok Movement is best propelled when The People notice the Setrok “B.U.Y” and “S.E.L.L” posts, take action via the information provided in the post, and then socially share the Setrok Posts with encouragement to participate.

\-  The Setrok Movement can be followed by all social media platforms via liking and following the page/profile. Also, The Setrock Movement can be monitored for updates through the hashtags #Setrock #SetrokBUY #SetrokSELL #SetrokMovement

\-  Remember, the earlier The People “take action” regarding the Setrok Posts, the more “reward” The People achieve. Also, the more people that participate in The Setrok Movement, the more “reward” We the People achieve.

\-  Power is in numbers, accessibility, speed, unity, and clear direction.

When

\-  The next announcement will be Tuesday, Feb 2nd, between 11:00am and 1:00pm

Who

\-  Setrok is an entity designed for The People and only exists act as a reference point for those participating in the movement.

\-  Setrok strives to maintain anonymity.

\-  Setrok was the Brainchild of an innovator highly discouraged with the financial system and their notorious processes. Processes by which they artfully maintain The People as steps from poverty while convincing The People they are just a few inches from financial happiness. During the events of the January 2021 GameStop squeeze attempt, the founder(s) discovered the power of their typeface on digital currency and the market.

\-  The power of a trending typeface coupled with the ease and accessibility of the market  to all The People, is a combination that, if done properly and as ONE force sharing the same outcome, could (and will) disrupt the entire system and balance the wealth and power back amongst We The People.",Setrok_Movement,-2,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/la5kaq/im_tired_of_these_is_next_short_squeeze_what_are/glmwiwx/,0.03,0.856,0.113,0.991

This makes the market much easier to unload on unsuspecting investors as it makes it appear that their value has dramatically increased when in fact is hasnt. You will usually see dramatic gains the following days followed by what appears to be a slow, gradual sell off. But it's not if you double the volume to before the split. Make sense?

299,IMO," I’d guess this is a pump. The amount of mentions it’s gotten on Reddit is unwarranted IMO. Robinhood even limited the amount of shred you could buy a couple days ago. Everything we are seeing right now is smoke and mirrors. (Pun intended) 

When it inevitably falls back down once the Reddit hype is gone that’s when I’m buying more. Target price for me is $1 a share, because that’s where they can realistically stay while waiting for US government action which will drive the price up based on more speculation. Anything around .60-80c a share is where I’m buying, definitely not at .99 a share that it’s at now lol.

311,AMC," Liquidity issues. They don't have enough capital to cover the 2 day trade holdovers. Recently, Robinhood started funding the trade capital themselves (which is why they had to borrow a billion dollars). They (or anyone for that matter) couldn't have seen the goliath GME trades coming and wasn't prepared.

Every trade that is made may be instant for the traders but a third party (citadel, apex, etc) covers those funds for 2 days and charges a fee (or gets paid in your trade data). That is why on paid trade services you are still able to trade GME, AMC, BB, etc. They charge a fee in advance so they are not restricted. (I suck at explaining things. Sorry about that lol). 

It's pretty complicated stuff. But that's the gist of it. Robinhood was trying to save face by lying about their liquidity issues. That's because they are a new company and plan on an IPO soon. Had they of just been honest things wouldn't have been so bad for them I suppose.

Anyways good luck trading bro.

I hope to publish a longer summary report on them tomorrow morning, but I've considered submitting an original post on here to gain some feedback.

IVR is $4

The last month IVR is up over 20%, last week IVR was up more than 6% after peaking at 4.50 mid week. they have earnings the third week of February.

Pre covid IVR traded at 17$, steadily climbing its way back up. Earnings are a huge part of the stock returning to previous values.

Short % is 22, institutional ownership is 55% and Feb.19 Short interest is all between 4-4.5 SP

With increased earnings run up, possibility of recovery (even though this stayed green last week) and its new found support around $4 - sporting an 8% dividend as well.

This provides both short term squeeze opportunities and long term dividend opportunity. It’s possible that we see price activity comparable to last June. This would mean $8-$9 a share. By the end of February if we can break 4.5 and hold that. But it seems to have a large MM wall at 4.50.

On the other hand what the company does with the money could make the original shares more valuable in the long run e.g. if the company needed cash to launch a product. If you believe the CEO is good at using the company money then an offering can be seen as a temporary discount.

On the production side, the US made huge strides in becoming a top exporter of oil due to fracking, but this only works when oil prices are high because it's so expensive. It's why basically all OPEC has to do is increase output to drive the price down and then US fracking is no longer feasible. Then on the consumption side, I think your point on EV's is huge. China is a big leader in pushing domestic EV's and US companies like Ford and GM are also setting goals to electrify their offerings. All that said, I'm not sure how I feel about oil drilling as it can be expensive compared to what it costs OPEC members to get their oil out of the ground. Think that there is still money to be made in oil, but would have to find the right entry for sure.",TheGallopingGhost77,1,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/l9qu7b/daily_discussion_thread/glm8vtl/,0.045,0.875,0.081,0.6444
556,NAKD, Rough time for NAKD today. I actually got out at 1.88. Was trying to hold for 2.25 but seemed like some strong headwinds were not going to allow that to happen.

637,AMC," Generally, options have significantly more potential,  because they provide you with leverage. Purchasing equity has no leverage, unless you are operating on margin.

However, options are more complex, since they are constrained by time, volatility, and price. 

In your example, it’s important to look at the implied volatility (IV), because this greatly affects the premium you pay as well as the potential payout. AMC has a staggering IV of 478%, and an IV percentile of 75%. This means IV is abnormally high, and as a result you will be paying a very high premium for your options. 

Since purchasing a call is a long vega position, and vega is affected by volatility, you ideally want to purchase options during periods of low IV, and sell during periods of high IV.

So, could you make a handsome profit on options? Possibly, but since the premiums are so high I think it would be more prudent to buy shares.",thirtydelta,6,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/l9nmc6/which_has_more_potential_option_calls_or_actual/gljn37o/,0.043,0.875,0.081,0.7184
