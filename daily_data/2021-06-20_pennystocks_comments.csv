48,IP," 260,000 women are diagnosed each year with breast cancer in the United States. 50,000 of those have high density breast cancer of which tamoxifen is not entirely suitable for due to side effects and endoxifen serves to provide a direct therapeutic for. Beyond that, the 260,000 could potentially benefit from endoxifen as a standard of care drug due to its efficiency as an active metabolite.

Furthermore, there are alternative uses for endoxifen including ovarian cancer, as determined by third party researchers via the UW in a special trial this spring and in other debilitating diseases. 

Furthermore again, in response to your ER+ argument, it’s invalid as about 80% of all breast cancers are “ER-positive.” That means the cancer cells grow in response to the hormone estrogen.

It’s a matter of when endoxifen’s IP and Atossa get bought out, not if.
