130,GME," >  If Robinhood shutting down trading had impacted the big guys. I’m pretty sure there would be a government bailout.

I very much doubt that - this was a very different situation from 2008.

The banks that were bailed out in 2008 were involved in ordinary peoples' mortgages and also heavily entwined in other parts of the banking (corporate financing) system. There was a fear at the time that allowing them to go bust would have a domino effect.

In order to pay the people they owed money to, those banks would have had to call in loans from the companies they lend money to, hence causing those to collapse in turn. This is just an example, and I'm not sure that it is exact - might've been more of a liquidity problem instead, with no-one else able to fill their role if they left a vacuum.

When the banks were bailed out in 2008, all the politicians involved recognised that the banking system shouldn't have been allowed to become so dependent on those companies - either that or, being dependent upon them, they should have been regulated and prohibited from taking the kinds of risk they did. I believe that this has since happened but, at the time, it was like shutting the stable door once the horse has bolted - you still need to buy a new horse (the bailout).

In your 401k you can buy index funds of the S&P 500, investment funds that predominantly buy British and European stocks instead, or investment funds that buy government bonds or invest in emerging markets. The hedge funds shorting GME are just the same kinds of funds, but for very very rich people, and they will be allowed to lose money or collapse. No rich people will be impoverished, because everyone spreads their money around through at least several different funds. 

If you want an example, look up the Woodford collapse, which saw some investors losing as much as 75% of their money by the time it was wound up. They weren't bailed out, nor were Bernie Madoff's investors. The 2008 bailout was maybe unfair but not only was it [paid back with interest](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2012/oct/25/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-banks-paid-back-all-federal-bail/)), but it was also a completely different situation.",strolls,11,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lf75c4/reminder_of_what_actually_happened_with_gme/gmkqfl9/,0.091,0.847,0.062,-0.8274

132,AMC," Complete newbie myself, and I hopped on the hype train like every other moron with a box of crayons.

I did not, however, throw any more at this than I was willing to lose.  I knew, for a fact, that anything I stuffed into this fire pit just might go up in smoke.

I bought in at $250 and all it did from there was tumble.  If I had a Fidelity account on Jan 28th (when I opened it, the stock was at a low of $193) instead of Feb 1st (when the funds finally became available to use), I would have been holding when the stock hit $400+ and kept holding until now, like a retard.

I also tossed some into AMC at the same time ($14/share), and it's mirrored GME. Long, slow roll downhill.

My account is down to 47% of it's original value.  I'm still holding, but may not be by the end of the day.  I wanted to be in for solidarity, but there's not much point if there's no point to make in it now except to continue losing.  Everything I've been reading that's written by anyone who sounds like they have common sense is saying the Hedge Funds slipped the noose, even if they had to cheat and be illegal to do it.

They should have taken the time to craft a better, more truthful notification for why they were forced to do what they did. And their Facebook style business model is horse shit, and deserves investigation. Just what data do they send to their clients?

this short squeeze is gonna happen, its not like the WV squeeze because one company had all the shares it wasn't a short squeeze triggered by retail investors like in our case and they didn't have Melvin connections to stop brokerage from buying the share in order to artificially create a stronger sell pressure and bring the price down.THE SHORT LADDER ATTACK ITS BLATANT , THE BOTS ON WSB AND DISCORD TELLING PEOPLE TO SELL ITS JSUT TO EASY TO SPOT, in this thread we love to make money as much we like to lose money, we laugh at each other gains and losses, by the way look at amc graph and gme they dropped in price and raised with a crazy correlation.

for a squeeze to happen we need strong catalyst from gme board, a strong q1 or q2 report could play the trick but the main strategy is hodlllllll. my price target is $500 until December .

APES TOGETHER STRONG !

NEVER FORGET!

Edit : somebody bought 5.000 gme $800 calls for March 19 !?! I don’t know if it means much but I think it could mean a lot . Another sketchy thing is that after  the 3/19 call all the other expirations have only calls up to $200 !!!!
Are they antecipating something ? I’ll buy one of those $800 calls tomorrow if they don’t get too expensive.

290,GME," 5000 gme at 800 was likely just hedging. A common practice used as a fail safe or to help cover or diminish any loses by big traders (like hedge funds). It's not uncommon to see something like this especially on a specific stonk that is so volatile.

With the way GME has been doing things I could be 100% wrong, but again this move is fairly common.

Also, great write up. It was a good read with a lot of solid points. You put a pretty good amount of time into this. Hopefully more people take the time to read your post!

This is mainly a message for those of you who bought in at $200+ and are still holding like legendary tards.

Y’all getting assaulted left right and centre psychologically regarding GME. Someone says hold, and other asks you to catch knives, another says the stock is dead, whereas someone else says to wait for tomorrow.

It can be really stressful. Don’t just sit there and stare at a line today. Make sure you drink water, speak to family and friends. Go get some fresh air. 

I’ve personally deleted the stock app so I don’t keep checking the prices. It won’t do you any good, unless you’re actively looking to buy on dips.

Don’t let anyone tell you what to do with your money. Don’t come on here just to cry / sweat with nervousness. This deffo isn’t the place to hype yourself up right now. Limit the amount of times your check in on GME. Look after your mental health smol monke.

347,RH," Make sure your broker is not lending out your shares, if you have RH you MUST downgrade to a cash account to stop them from doing so.

How to downgrade your account to a ""RH Cash"" account.: the difference with this kind of account is you must wait until your bank deposit clears to trade. no more instant deposits or access to funds after a trade, you must wait upto 3 days after selling a share to be able to trade with those funds. The only way to even have this option to downgrade is waiting 2-3 days after your last sell or bank deposit clears. Nothing can be pending on your account, then after 3 days you can convert according to RH. To convert: Hit the bottom right Profile Button Hit the 3 lines in the top right corner Go to Investing Scroll to the bottom and hit Day trade settings On the bottom you will find Turn off Instant Settlement If you dont see this option make sure you have already turned off margin and downgraded from Gold. If the option is still not there you will have to contact customer service so they can do it manually. This should convert all your shares to full ownership to you, since they were directly purchased by you with your own money RH can no longer use your shares to cover the shorts, but It might still be a good idea to contact customer service and confirm anyway its been done.",Setnof,24,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lf9rdy/gme_megathread_for_mon_28/gmkzwgm/,0.019,0.913,0.068,0.8151

When it falls down further, we see occasional slight spikes as people are motivated to ""buy the dip.""

For you, you seem to have Extreme difficulty if people disagree.

Write up a good DD and present your case to the sub. 

Maybe you’ve got Great evidence, I think you might reach More people with honey than vinegar, is all I’m saying.

You are welcome to vocalize your opinion that people are wrong, I just find your motivations for doing so, super sad.

Because you and I both know, you aren’t actually hear because you Care, nor do you want to help.

You just want to spill your vitriol all over the place, in order to feel Control over others, in a way that helps you accept the Lack of control  and vulnerability you experience in your Real Life.

I remember tons of posts with thousands of upvotes and the top comments just ripping them apart or making fun of them. That's what made this place entertaining and fun to be around.

Edit:

And example of this was a day or two ago someone posted a DD on $WWE and how he was buying calls. That post got buried with negativity and never saw the light of day even though he put in a lot of time and effort. Normally it would have had at least a couple thousand upvotes for the amount of effort he put in. Instead it was down voted to oblivion.

441,DD," Thank you.  I jumped into GME late without doing DD and probably invested more than I should have.  I could afford to lose it so I’m not too stressed about it, but I don’t have confidence it will squeeze again.  Others might disagree and that’s fine, but I took a loss on ~3/4s of my GME holdings to keep the cash above a certain amount in my investment account.

I changed my mind about selling when I saw a post on another investing subreddit about “opportunity cost,” and how taking a loss so you can re-invest in a longer position with less volatility is sometimes the better move.

IMO there absolutely is a cost to holding your GME shares, especially if it continues falling, and just telling everyone to hold for some pie-in-the-sky short squeeze is not an exit strategy.  Some money is better than none for many (I know this is WSB but I’m speaking to the others like myself who rode the hype train poorly).

I definitely still don’t know what I’m doing but at least now I have a baseline in my account I feel comfortable with no matter what happens to GME, and I can take the time to do DD before I invest again.

I don't believe short squeeze happened with my own research and calculation. I'm not investing and I'm just betting on short squeeze. I don't really like this sub basically calling out on people who sold early like ""paper hand bitch"" since I believe anyone who wants to sell should be able to sell since its their money.

482,GME," I disagree somewhat. This kind of stuff happens on a smaller scale all the time with specific game subreddits. As soon as a big sale happens, or a free weekend, etc. there's an influx of new players to the subreddit and the long time subscribers pretty much have to brace themselves for all the new players flooding the community.

It's definitely a bit of annoyance seeing the 15th time the same newbie question was asked, or the 20th complaint about x being too overpowered when it's only difficult to new players. But overall it's more engagement in the community and the veteran players will typically correct the new players when they say some dumb bullshit, end of discussion...

What happened here however, was a bit different in the fact that the ""noob wave"" wasn't just a spike in subscribers, it was a 6-7x increase to the original subscriber count and it essentially became a GME cult. There were so many GME apes that they could just create a closed feedback loop of dumbfucks upvoting dumbfucks and while shunning away anything that opposes them.

I don't think the issue was inexperienced traders talking out of line (although it is annoying how matter-of-fact some of these people are), it's more about how cult-like it became with all of the new subscribers, basically overthrowing the opinions more experienced users in favor of dumb bullshit to pump the morale of GME holders.

I should have stuck to my original plan to sell my principle and/or all of it at 420.69, but the hype and greed and media attention spiking the price to $483 really caught me thinking that this was for sure going to hit $1000.

I still like the stock, I still believe in the value play for GME (if it goes down like Netflix did with their pivot, I'm thinking $300/share value easily. Even modestly, I still think this should be an $80-100 stock), so I'll hold what I've got, but man just thinking about what I could have walked away with if I didn't get greedy makes me sad.

I don't think GME or any institution is as unscrupulous as Martin Shkreli is so I doubt the latter will happen. The former can happen in a combination of ways, but to explain it, we have learned the hard way that synthetic longs exist to create liquidity, and as long as there are shares to borrow there will continue to be liquidity. However, in a surge of buying power, liquidity dries up temporarily, which is likely what happened the first time around, this created a squeeze in which small players were forced out of the game causing the price to continue until liquidity demands could eventually be met.

~~>The synthetic long stock is an options strategy used to simulate the payoff of a long stock position. It is entered by buying at-the-money calls and selling an equal number of at-the-money puts of the same underlying stock and expiration date.~~

Synthetic Long: Created by borrowing a share and selling it short. Example: Alice buys 100 shares of XYZ. Bob borrows those shares and sells them on the open market as a short sale. Carl buys them. Now Carl owns 100 synthetic shares. (This does not mean that anything bad for Carl. He gets 100 shares no matter what. It's just that his shares were basically created out of thin air, or 'synthetically'). 

I made this comment about Short Interest and S3 Short Interest in another thread, but I'm reposting it here. 

According to investopia.com:

>To calculate the short interest percentage for a stock, divide the number of shorted shares by the number of shares available for trade. The number of tradable shares is also referred to as ""the float.""

In other words:

>Number of Shares Short / Number of Shares Float * 100 = Short Percentage of Float

So take a hypothetical company, XYZ, that has a float of 10M shares. If a hedge fund were to borrow 5M shares and then sell them short, the short percentage of float would be 50% (5 / 10 = .5 * 100 = 50%).

But Ihor has really been pushing his ""S3 Short Percentage of Float"" as being the ""true"" percentage of float. He says the old way does not reflect reality because it does not take into account synthetic longs created by ~~buying ATM calls and selling ATM puts at the same price and expiration date~~ short selling shares that were already the product of another short sale (see /u/XxpapiXx69 reply to this comment). So, he says it should be calculated by taking the number of shares short and dividing it by the number of shares in the float, plus the number of synthetic shares.

In other words:

>Number of Shares Short / (Number of Shares Float + Number of Synthetic Longs) * 100 = S3 Short Percentage of Float

Going back to our example from before, say that in addition to one HF borrowing 5M shares to sell short, another HF ~~buys enough ATM calls and sells an equal number of puts at the same price~~ shorts enough shares (that were already borrowed and sold as shorts) to create another 2M synthetic longs. Ihor and S3 would have us calculate SI like this:

>(5M +2M) / (10M + 2M) * 100 = 58.33%

Maybe some HF goes balls to the walls and creates as many synthetic longs as in the original float. So they create, let's say, a total of 10M synthetic longs. Again, S3 wants us to use this formula:

>(5M +10M) / (10M + 10M) * 100 = 75%

~~Notice how the float hasn't changed and the shares short haven't changed, but somehow the percentage of float short (according to S3) is going down?~~

Are synthetic longs somehow just now being created? Why has this new formula just now come to light? Is Ihor some kind of genius for connecting the dots no one ever has before? I don't think so.

I have no evidence, just suspicion, but the fact that he started posting to twitter daily that GME SI is now only 50% or whatever seems like messaging that would definitely benefit those on the short side. The retail investors that have been swept up into this tornado have been scouring the internet for this information, and Ihor is more than happy to provide it to us. I don't buy it.

584,RH," I think according to his calculations that the short interest can never be 100%, which could be misleading.

I think whichever way you calculate it does not really matter as long as it is consistent across all calculations. Kind of like %ITM and %OTM.

I may have messed up in that example, I think what they (being WSB) refer to as a synthetic share (synthetic long) would be the IOU that short sellers owe long stock holders.

The IOU appears in your account as regular long stock, but it is not regular long stock.

There is an interesting video on how the DTCC works called ""the dark side of the looking glass""  on YT channel name Judd Bagley.

Another interesting read would be the NOPE effect, the winding and unwinding of market maker hedges.

The most interesting idea I have come across in my musings recently is the idea that people could scale into positions using short puts and not allow their shares to be borrowed. Since Market Makers can create shares out of thin air, it is entirely reasonable that someone who has scaled in through short puts could actually stack up FTDs in the system and possibly own the float or more than the float.

Please let me know what you think about this.

Also I believe that RH was taking the other side of customer trades through their broker dealer department. I have not seen that being discussed anywhere.

903,GME," > if you think this shit is co-op, you're going to lose your shirt.

maybe for the plebs, but big money absolutely plays co-op when and if it suits them.

The entire idea behind GME is that the rules of the game seem to be changing.

By all means everyone *should* set their own targets, but if you think prisoners' dilemma is not real on this one then you're not paying enough attention.

Retailers did play coop and it worked so well big money had to cheat to stave off (for the time being) a massive squeeze.

So while I understand the logic behind your post, I find two major criticisms:

1) big money has always played coop (even though they prey on one another at times; when the going gets really tough they'll stick together)

2) social media and the space/time compression allows plebs to play co-op as well.

How well the latter works in the future is yet to be decided.",darkside_of_the_tomb,21,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lff3g1/something_i_noticed_people_have_confused_about/gmlzmwu/,0.104,0.773,0.123,0.6768

To hold on to that much unrealized profit, he must believe on a fundamental level that the stock is worth more: either long term with new direction, or for other reasons. Holding serves zero benefit for him: the end result is the same (infamy/fame) and the ways he can capitalize on it are worse for holding til GME crashes and burns than if he cashed out at the top.

lol – they say this as if keeping the msg up for all to see is out of their control.

This is why GME is so important.

The media and all these traditional institutions are relying on their old tricks to subvert the data and maintain THEIR narrative.

Yes – that worked for boomers who were able to launch awesome careers right out of the high school...

But sorry – this generation of indebted degenerates mostly have undergraduate degrees at minimal and more with advanced degrees.

Their manipulation just doesn't cut the mustard and that's why we're holding; it's also why they're scared shitless.

The overall landscape of at least the US energy sector is still very much rooted in legacy players (but that may also be why it's still not too late to get in too). Solar I can understand, since it's becoming more popular by the day in commercial environments. Hydrogen is a bit of a more unproven plan, mostly held back by infrastructure requirements at least in the EV world. Nuclear is going to be held back by public sentiment, I feel.

1190,EV," Hydrogen is a dubious long-term investment IMO. It's basically regular EV with extra steps. To turn hydrogen into useful energy, you have produce hydrogen -> store/transport hydrogen (annoying, since it leaks through basically everything) -> burn hydrogen or use a fuel cell -> get electricity to use/put in a battery.

1. Biofuels do not necessarily need to be used in vehicles. They can be used for power generation, or heat generation for heat process industries. People always assume ""biofuels"" mean liquid fuels. It does not. Most biofuels are coal substitutes. 

2. Most biofuels right now come from waste material. Offcuts from wood. Used rice husks. Things like that. It's taking a material that will decompose anyway and using it for something productive. 

3. Biofuel has the ability to react to fluctuations on the power grid. You can't crank up the sun and make solar panels generate more electricity - you CAN shovel more Biofuels into a boiler to increase output

4. Biofuel is NOT expensive to store, unlike electricity. The thing holding Solar up is the huge battery banks needed to supply an energy grid. 

5. Biofuels aren't reliant on the weather - you can burn them at any time. Much better for parts of the world with no sun (cough Northern Europe cough)

CCIV 4 x $40c 3/19/21

Plus about $5k in gains on 250 CCIV shares

Also selling some covered calls but those are smaller profits

1264,CCIV," Well, it's half and half. We were all wary about SPACs early on because we thought they were just a way for people to get stoked on piles of money that usually put these companies in penny stock territory, which we always filtered out previously.

We tried having different market cap rules and then went back to just not allowing them. It was kind of stupid but the aim was always to prevent pennystock-like stuff in here while not being averse to anything new that seemed weird.

Sorry it looks wonky, but what I said was true, the ousted admin decided SPACs across the board were out and there were no market cap rules. I'm not saying they got that wrong either. We probably should have either done that from the start or just treated them like any other ticker market-cap wise.

1266,AMC," Not OP, but let me give it a shot.

OP didn't actually buy the AMC stock when buying calls, calls are contracts to buy a stock at a certain price before or during the expiration of a contract.

Let's say that for whatever reason I'm super confident that GM (General Motors) will rise in price before, uhh, 26th of February. So I buy call options at 57 strike price for 1.75 each. Don't let the 1.75 price fool you, because options are in sets of 100, so that would cost you $175 instead of $1.75

What's strike price then? Using above example, the 57 strike price means that I have the right to purchase 100 GM stocks at 57 each before or during the expiration date, 26th of February. Of course, if GM stays below 57 dollars per share, I do not have to exercise the contract, as if I want to buy GM shares I could just get them at market price. 

Assuming zero commission, the GM stock price needs to be 57+1.75 for you to break even, and if it goes above 58.75 you start making money. Meanwhile, your maximum loss is $175

You could always cash out/close your position as well when buying call options, let's say before the 26th GM's stock price goes from the current 54.41 to around 56.50, these call options get more valuable as they're closer to the strike price, so you can resell for higher value.

Hope this is clear and I've managed to explain how buying calls work. Puts is around the opposite but completely different. There's also people who SELL calls and puts and that's also different.

The newest short numbers come out on the 9th. If you’re wondering whether to get involved in GME or not, if the short percentages are lower than ‘squeezesquoze’ standards, then it’ll tank. 

Which could just mean $70 down to $35, but anyone that’s looking to INVEST in GME (as a good company with a bright future) can have a safer entry point. 

Learn from the people that have lost 80% of their investment on this recent tumble and see where it bottoms out first.

1311,GME," Fundamental analysis is different than due diligence, and this is most certainly due diligence in this post. Nothing wrong with being a GME bear, just don't take on something you can't afford to lose. ""These prices"" is a relative term, and I will buy down to 40, at which there is strong support. You can also see that I sold near dated covered calls, and I will continue to do so as I feel appropriate. I bought because I can gauge sentiment and believe that the bottom has become near. I can justify buying up to $100 personally (after that, there are easier ways to make money), but there becomes strong resistance at that point. You're right in the fact that I worded my Chewy portion poorly, and I should have said something to the effect of minimizing operating costs for maximum benefit. I have read much more than 2 press releases (trust me here, I've spent a lot of time doing actual research), and as you can tell I don't spend a ton of time on Reddit. Citron's short seller report makes me laugh, as each point is easily debunked. Although I can't include every bit of information I know into a Reddit post, I thought this painted a pretty holistic picture of the turnaround story, of which I am a firm believer.

https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0yzb5/a_venture_capital_perspective_on_gme/

I went in earlier, I still believe in the company as well.  I sold >half of my position on the ride up, held some incase it mooned more - which it didn't.   Bought more with some of the money I made and I'm going to hold long term unless another squeeze happens, though I think the first run was mostly just hype and retail buyers, not as much people covering.  But it doesn't make a difference for me because I like the company.

In addition to that perhaps several other goundbreaking ideas that you and I simply have not been able to think of. My point is why would he devote such enormous amounts of his money (and more importantly, time) to this business if he isn't absolutely convinced of the future potential of GME?

1353,SHO," **How Margin accounts help shorters:**

If shares are in a margin account, they may be loaned to a short without the consent or knowledge of the account owner. If the shares are in a cash account, IRA account or are restricted shares they are not supposed to be borrowed unless there is express consent by the account owner.

Margin account buyers, because of loopholes in the rules, inadvertently aid the shorts. If short A sells a naked short he has three days to deliver a borrowed share. If the counterfeit share is purchased in a margin account, it is immediately put into the stock lend and, for a fee, is available as a borrowed share to the short who counterfeited it in the first place. This process is perpetually fluid with multiple parties, but it serves to create more counterfeit shares and is an example of how a counterfeit share gets “laundered” into a legitimate borrowed share.

Margin account agreements give the broker dealers the right to lend those shares without notifying the account owner. Shares held in cash accounts, IRA accounts and any restricted shares are not supposed to be loaned without express consent from the account owner. Broker dealers have been known to change cash accounts to margin accounts without telling the owner, take shares from IRA accounts, take shares from cash accounts and lend restricted shares. One of the prime brokers recently took a million shares from cash accounts of the company's founding investors without telling the owners or the stockbroker who represented ownership. The shares were put into the stock lend, which got the company off the SHO threshold list, and opened the door for more manipulative shorting.

IPO laddering has nothing to do with short ladders, the only thing they have in common is the name. The fact that IPO laddering is real doesn't say anything about the existence of short ladders **because they're totally different things.** Surely the existence of rope ladders doesn't also support the existence of short ladders.

IPO laddering works because there is essentially only one seller during the IPO, and that seller has agreed to participate in the illegal scheme. Short laddering **would not** work because for GME there isn't just one buyer, there are many buyers (in this sub alone) and they never agreed to participate in an illegal scheme to drive the price down.",Perrin_Pseudoprime,9,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lf4vn3/yes_laddering_is_real_short_ladder_attack_is_just/gmkd2xb/,0.074,0.868,0.058,-0.4757

1356,SHO," True. Though it's ""hidden"" in my citations;

>**The Creation of Counterfeit Shares** — There are a variety of names that the securities industry has dreamed up that are euphemisms for counterfeit shares. Don't be fooled: Unless the short seller has actually borrowed a real share from the account of a long investor, the short sale is counterfeit. It doesn't matter what you call it and it may become non–counterfeit if a share is later borrowed, but until then, there are more shares in the system than the company has sold.  
>  
>The magnitude of the counterfeiting is hundreds of millions of shares every day, and it may be in the billions. The real answer is locked within the prime brokers and the DTC. Incidentally, counterfeiting of securities is as illegal as counterfeiting currency, but because it is all done electronically, has other identifiers and industry rules and practices, i.e. naked shorts, fails–to–deliver, SHO exempt, etc. the industry and the regulators pretend it isn't counterfeiting. Also, because of the regulations that govern the securities, certain counterfeiting falls within the letter of the rules. The rules, by design, are fraught with loopholes and decidedly short on allowing companies and investors access to information about manipulations of their stock.

1712,HP," did you know that in terms of male human and female Pokémon breeding, Vaporeon is the most compatible Pokémon for humans? Not only are they in the field egg group, which is mostly comprised of mammals, Vaporeon are an average of 3”03’ tall and 63.9 pounds, this means they’re large enough to be able handle human dicks, and with their impressive Base Stats for HP and access to Acid Armor, you can be rough with one. Due to their mostly water based biology, there’s no doubt in my mind that an aroused Vaporeon would be incredibly wet, so wet that you could easily have sex with one for hours without getting sore. They can also learn the moves Attract, Baby-Doll Eyes, Captivate, Charm, and Tail Whip, along with not having fur to hide nipples, so it’d be incredibly easy for one to get you in the mood. With their abilities Water Absorb and Hydration, they can easily recover from fatigue with enough water. No other Pokémon comes close to this level of compatibility. Also, fun fact, if you pull out enough, you can make your Vaporeon turn white. Vaporeon is literally built for human dick. Ungodly defense stat+high HP pool+Acid Armor means it can take cock all day, all shapes and sizes and still come for more",Jimmy_bags,5,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfedqc/me_dreaming_about_our_fight_for_gme_last_night/gmland0/,0.064,0.83,0.105,0.8721

Lets say we have a jungle with 69.75M 🍌(oustanding) in it. Now, a bunch of 🐒 Chiefs have 22.986M 🍌 locked away, so theres 46.89M 🍌(float) for all the animals🦍🐒🦧🐅🦓🦁🦏🐘🦒🦥🦜🐍 in the jungle to buy and sell. Now, along come some 🌈🐻🐷🚹 who have an idea to make some money. They borrow bananas and take out loans to borrow more bananas and write a bunch of IOUs for bananas, basically fuddle everything up. Now with all those IOUs everyone thinks theres 114M 🍌(institutional holdings). If the 🌈🐻🐷🚹 plan works, theyll make a bunch of money and there will be no more 🍌. Now, a bunch of 🦍 really like 🍌, so they start buying the🍌 and holding them, cus they dont wanna sell them to the 🌈🐻🐷🚹. The 🌈🐻🐷🚹 dont like this, cus it could upset their plan to take all the 💸 and destroy all the 🍌. So the 🌈🐻🐷🚹 start yelling at the 🦍 saying you cant do that and your 🍌 are worthless, trying to get them to sell their bananas. But the real strong 💎👐🦍 don't care, theyre gonna save their 🍌 and make the 🌈🐻🐷🚹 owe a lot of money. The 🦍 only need 3,000,000 🦍 to hold 15.63🍌 each and theyll own all the available real 🍌(3M x 15.63 = 46.89M, the float). If 3M 🦍 each buy and hold 23.25🍌, including some IOUs, they own all the 🍌 that exist(3M x 23.25 = 69.75M, 🍌outstanding). If the 3M 🦍 buy and hold 38 🍌 each, they will own all 🍌 AND all the IOUs(3M x 38 = 114M, institutional holdings). If all the 🦍 hold atleast the float of 46.89M 🍌, the 🌈🐻🐷🚹 will owe more and more 💸 per banana they borrowed, and the price would continually rise until the 🦍 decide to sell some bananas to the 🌈🐻🐷🚹.

> Here's my math. Global TV ad spending is approaching $180b a year. ROKU is currently in 10 percent of streamer homes. COVID has accelerated that money moving from traditional TV to streaming, so ROKU rev topping $15b a year is completely realistic. Whittle that down to $5b profit with a conservative one-third profit margin, it works out to $35 a share. Put a conservative 20x multiple on it, I feel really good about a $700 price target.

$15b revs is a lot but I think with the recent push of local TV advertising into OTT, it is totally realistic. Local TV stations are now all telling advertisers they are able to target specific viewers thanks to OTT data they get on the end user, they used to target the lowest common denominator when local TV was strictly broadcast, which is why local ads are usually all personal injury lawyer and workers' comp ads. They're getting higher quality, better paying advertisers because they can now promise precise end user targeting via ROKU.

Congrats!

Regarding Cathie, that's standard procedure and the way she runs her funds as best as I can tell as a non-insider.

The much bigger risk of her funds is in the future when some of the holdings constitute a large percentage of a company's market cap and she gets, for instance, 1B+ redemptions into an illiquid market. The risk of that does not scale linearly with fund size, and not letting one holding overpower mitigates this. I'm in the funds myself and many of their constituents myself so whatever.

1926,SI," As of today, 127% of float.

Based on most recent SI data, and then factored in the short shares that have been covered in the meantime.

THINK ABOUT THIS

When a short share is covered, it is bought and returned back to the original owner. This owner HAD to have the ability to lend out shares enabled, or else it would not have been lent out in the first place. (Turning this feature off results in your shares being recalled, and thus when a short covers, it would not be returning to you if you had lending disabled.)

So, if that share gets returned, it is then reasonable to assume it will become available to short again, based on the settings for that broker/account/customer.

NYSE provides real time numbers of the number of shares available to be shorted!

So as that number rises, you can tell that shorts are actually covering.

When there were 0 shares available for shorting, SI was reported to be 61.78 million (January 15th data) and as of today (10:47am) there are 2.02 million shares available for shorting.

So regardless of shorts covering/new shorts jumping in/ whatever else, it is clear that the number of shares short as of today is up around 59.8 million still.

PLEASE let me know if there is something wrong with this logic. It seems so simple and obvious to me, but the fact that nobody else is mentioning it makes me think maybe I am the dumb one.",hyperian24,36,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfa1vf/discussion_logically_gme_short_interest_in_the/gmlawcf/,0.025,0.877,0.098,0.7756

1933,SI," this is just wrong.  IBD only reports one brokerage.  they mention that on the page.  additionally, you can make shares you own unable for borrowing.

i.e. stock XYZ has 100M shares.  assume zero are actually shorted for arguments sake.  only 10M are owned by interactive brokers users (the brokerage that IBD uses).  IBD reports 2M available for shorting.  what about the other 98M?  are they already shorted?  no (because of our assumption).  8M owned by IB users have made them unavailable for borrowing.  we know nothing about the other 90M based on reported data.

now assume all 2M of those shares are shorted.  IBD reports 2M shares still available for borrowing.  what's going on?  those 2M shares were bought by people also willing to make them available for shorting.  so number of shares shorted goes up, but number available doesn't change.  repeat 50 times.

2041,AMD," There's so much wrong information here...  

First of all, TSMC doesn't make 3 nm chips. They're in the process of developing the 3 nm process and it isn't expected to be ready until 2022. Even once its available, in 2022, it won't ready for wide scale manufacturing for another year or two because yields will be very low. AMD's latest Zen 3 cores are built with a refined 7 nm node. Their roadmap for Zen 4 (5 nm) chips states it'll come out in 2022. 5 nm is still in the early production phase (low yields) and Apple booked out all of its capacity for 2021.  

Intel as you said is still stuck on 14 nm. Their newest chips coming out in Q1 2021 (Rocket Lake S) is still 14 nm+++++++++. Not only that, but they got fewer cores (8) than their previous flag ship (10). Intel says their long overdue 10 nm chips (Alder Lake S) will come out in Q3/4 2021, but who knows if they can actually keep the deadline. It wouldn't be the first time Intel said they're on track with their new node and then announce they're fucked several months later. They outsourced chips from TSMC, but they only outsourced it for their Core i3 lineup, which means absolutely nothing. Their flagship money makers are still manufactured in-house.  

Intel has made some very good leadership changes this month, but changing leadership doesn't mean immediate results. It'll take 2-4 years until the re-hired engineers can produce a leading class chip because chip development takes a very long time. AMD has at least those 2-4 years to eat away at Intel's market share. They're also not afraid of dropping prices to create value. I have no doubt in my mind, if Intel's Rocket Lake S chips out-perform in single thread tasks, AMD would either release their value non-X chips or just drop the price of their X chips to once again overtake Intel in the value/performance ratio. The good times aren't ending for AMD, they're just beginning. The newest high end gaming laptops are all AMD+Nvidia solutions when it used to be Intel+Nvidia.

2111,GME," I think you might be confused on what a put is.  By your position card you sold 2 780p and bought 1 800p.  In english, you sold someone insurance on 200 shares against the price of $GME being below 780, and bought insurance against it being below 800.  


Breaking it into pairs, you have 1 bull put spread, with a limited max loss of 2,000 minus premium and a single naked 780 put where your max loss is 78,000.  


Those are both deep deep in the money puts, and **absolutely unquestionably will be exercised**.  You will pay 780 \* 200 = $156,000 and receive 200 shares.  Then you will exercise your 1 800 put contract and receive 800\*100 = 80,000.  The final value change of your account should be -76000 cash and +100 shares GME.  The only way this doesn't happen is if $GME is over 800 in 4 days, i.e. an act of God and congress.

So what to do?  You should have received massive amounts of premium for the two puts you sold.  Use that money and some cash to buy back *at least* the naked put asap.

2138,GME," I've been wondering if I should post a small advice post similar to this just letting people know that their realized GME position is worth quite a lot year over year, since you can only claim -3k losses yearly. Some of these people have tax-free capital gains for years depending on how well they do (based on how negative they realized their GME losses).",JinnPhD,0,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lew3xw/a_little_unsexy_but_a_reminder_to_pay_your_damn/gmjlkgp/,0.093,0.814,0.093,-0.25
2139,GME," It's also only with very similar securities, so if you take a -100k loss in GME you have a solid buffer for capital gains if you invest in different stocks, and it's additive for future capital gains. 

3k a year in deductions for losses and it'll remain until the net gain reaches >100k. So essentially the next 100k of capital gains would be tax free",JinnPhD,17,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lew3xw/a_little_unsexy_but_a_reminder_to_pay_your_damn/gmjlvdj/,0.066,0.683,0.252,0.9038

2144,DD," Nice DD. 

&#x200B;

I work in the industry. 

&#x200B;

Everyone is drooling over LEDs. They are a potentially awesome solution, but 1) there is still a lot of research to do on what wavelenghts and applications will give the growers a true advantage 2) how the energy landscape will make using LEDs or not business sense for the grower 3) the cost of the LEDs still make them unprofitable at least under commercial greenhouse conditions. 

&#x200B;

Plus the market will be rapidly commoditized which makes my inexperienced ass hard to decide where to put the money. 

&#x200B;

I am more interested in the potential application of LEDs in water treatment. Less number of players, harder market accessibility for companies and a lot of money going around. Whoever can come up and convince utilities and water treatment companies to adopt LED - based water treatment tech, that's probably where I would put some money on. This is also interesting because proving the viability of LEDs for the application happens much faster than vegetable growing trials.",Pastelitomaracucho,20,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfb6hw/the_emerging_agricultural_led_tech_market/gmkx1i1/,0.034,0.807,0.16,0.9625
2145,DD," Here's my 2cents as someone that's tried to stay on top of led canna tech for the last 10 years. These red/blue panels are old news. The newer tech is the samsung leds {lm301}and cobs. IMO the lighting companies are still playing catch up with tech and customer demand. Just look at the websites of any major retail led manufacture and you'll see that about 5-10 years ago they were balls deep in these red/blue aka 'blurple' panels, and now these top companies have all switched over {within the last 2 years or so}to white samsung leds with a little bit of supplemental uv or deep red. I think even nasa has switched over to more of the white leds rather than pure red/blue panels...but I only have pic evidence of that and can't find any recent articles about which leds they use. For a quick and easy look you can go to any 'grow' forum and go to the lighting sub forum and see what kinds of lights ppl are recommending, it's overwhelmingly led panels that have samsung lm301 leds in them, no matter the panel brand.

I don't mean to discount any of your DD, it's much appreciated. I'm just giving my perspective from what I've seen personally within the grow community. Things also might be following completely different trends in china. Also the retail buyers themselves ~~might be~~ probably are behind on the newer tech and still purchasing red/blues under the guise that they are 'full spectrum', and chasing the chlorophyll a/b charts.

2214,CAN," A few counterpoints on the solar aspect:

> Tesla Solar: with the new administration and their focus on renewable, solar will be front and center. With an existing relationship with over 1.3 million auto customers, Tesla will easily convert many of them to solar owner

Tesla solar has been - to date - an unmitigated disaster. Seriously. Read up on it. It's a clusterfuck of ridiculous proportions. People don't want to touch it. Overbudget, extremely late, poorly done. They have apparently just bounced after doing half a job and then couldn't be contacted. Solar roof has yet to prove itself, currently it's a glorified tech demo. 

I know several people with Powerwalls (solid product) and none of them have Tesla solar. 

> If even 10% of the total households in the US get basic solar added it’ll equate to over $1T in yearly revenue. 

Big citation needed. This is classic ""baby's first startup"" Ali G math. ""It's an eleventy billion dollar market! IF WE CAN JUST GET 1% OMG SUCH MONEY WOW."" Ok cool beans, **how** are you going to get that 1%? Nevermind 10%. That is massive penetration (lol).  

> FYI Tesla has the cheapest solar by a long margin. 

Huge ""citation needed."" Not only has this been empirically shown to *not* be the case, it doesn't make much sense on the face of it. Traditional solar panels are about as simple as it gets. Wire some solar panels together under glass and you're done. Solar roof has a much more complicated process, much more complex install (that has yet to be demonstrated at scale), will suffer from worse efficiency due to aesthetic concerns (gotta look nice) not to mention inability to angle them for best production. Meaning you need more of them.

&#x200B;

> Tesla Semi: this is one I’m super interested in. Walmart and other logistics businesses already bought thousands on back order. Compared to a 18 wheeler, a semi is 35% more efficient (and faster) meaning 35% or more reduction in transportation cost expanding margins for businesses. No brainer. 

35% more efficient in what way? How exactly does that translate to lower costs? Gotta look a little deeper than that. Speed is somewhat irrelevant.

So you just got here last week. Alright...maybe this guy will have something relevant to say unlike every single other post that starts off with this caveat.

>Expected Value (EV) = ((Total Negative Outcomes)\*(Likelihood of Occurrence)+(Total Positive Outcomes)\*(Likelihood of Occurrence))

Okay, so you took an intro to probability class. Surely you aren't going to randomly fill this equation in with numbers that your ape brain spits out. There has to be some kind of algorithm or reasoning that leads you to these numbers, otherwise this post is completely meaningless.

>Likelihood that it hit's $30 before $1,000, idk, let's say I estimate 95% chance of that happening first.

So you wasted all of this time writing out a post to just fill in an EV equation with random retarded numbers, assuming that there's a 5% chance a stock 15x's before it goes back to where it was before it squeezed.

I like the fact that they helped many get interested in stocks, but they handed them a loaded gun. They should've been well aware of what could happen if trading spiked.

My opinion is that both sides have many issues. The main ones for the HF is how are they able to have a 140% short position on any stock? As for RH, they created this problem themselves by gamifying trading and giving access to margin and options trading to those that had no prior experience or knowledge of what they were doing. I like the fact that they helped many get interested in stocks, but they handed them a loaded gun. They should've been well aware of what could happen if trading spiked. They didn't have enough reserves and more over, they lied about the situation when they had a chance to explain themselves. Their model is full of conflicts. No different than Facebook giving us a ""free"" platform to posts pictures in.",DMK5506,4,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lf5sn8/is_the_9th_really_going_to_be_the_breakthrough/gmkam2n/,0.097,0.803,0.1,-0.3732
2290,RH," 1) Twitter is an awful idea and way more easily infiltrated by people manipulating and way less people who are actually smart that would be willing to speak up.

2) Putting the blame on RH for giving retailers the ability to buy options is just bs... ""loaded gun"" - Really? Maybe RH gamified trading and made it trendy, but they did not over-leverage a chain of institutions and force them to ignore risk-management practices.

3) You nailed the last part - the simple fact is that every almost every single major institution benefitted by shutting down and blaming retail traders when they got caught with their pants down for practices that are illegal and heavily punished in other countries.",Corona-walrus,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lf5sn8/is_the_9th_really_going_to_be_the_breakthrough/gml8mkc/,0.172,0.751,0.077,-0.9325

Look. 

You’re looking at this in a conservative manner. If hedge funds didn’t continue to be able to profit off of speculative shorts on stocks, you’re frame of mind would be accurate, as it is valid. 

Regardless of how we view somethings value(or lack of), Every commodity, currency, every **thing** on earth becomes more valuable when the supply of it diminishes, and in this case it doesn’t have to be finite like a mineral. 

Expedite the time table of that value rising when the supply shortage becomes public(think about toilet paper at the beginning of the pandemic for instance, or the price gauging of face masks etc). 

**TL;Dr:** The rational value of anything becomes irrelevant the moment there becomes less and less of it. 

In this case, a good example would be a shorted stock.",RamseyHatesMe,31,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leydor/is_amc_at_the_current_price_683_a_good_deal/gmiub7a/,0.027,0.841,0.132,0.9381

Organic: It will go down due to the weird situation of current investors being invested due to the hype and not due to the company. It will go back up once people begin investing into AMC as an actual investment (which I'd imagine they will since AMC currently has good prospects)

Manipulation: Going on people's idea of the price being manipulated and whatnot, if any of that is going on, I'd imagine they will push the price down as low as they can so they can cover and then it will go back up. 

Also if the report that comes out tomorrow says that there's still a lot of short interest in it then I'd expect a rise, but if that's the case I'd also expect a rise today from short covers since they'd anticipate the news tomorrow creating another rise and would want to get ahead of it.",SPNarwhal,2,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfdcqq/will_amc_jump_in_price/gml63g6/,0.043,0.913,0.044,0.2854

2411,ENPH," I love ENPH. I'd bought their stock when it was around two bucks and am still holding it. My investment didn't have anything to do with financial analysis -- I like their product. In researching to install solar at the house, one of the big problems with solar arrays (when you don't live in a flat, open area) is that production is drops to the level of the lowest producing panel in the array. That big tree at the corner of my property starts throwing some shade on the array, all of those panels in full sun are slacking. Enphase makes ""micro-inverters"" which allow each panel to operate independently. Their product makes the solar installation a little more expensive on a per-panel basis. In non-ideal solar areas (like where I live), though, the price per kWh produced is better -- or, more accurately, I can produce the power I need with fewer panels (less space AND less money). I expect additional federal incentives either this year or next, so anticipate an increase in residential solar installations. And I'm hoping growth in residential solar installations in places that aren't wide open, flat, super sunny locations drive micro-inverter sales.",ljr55555,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfdy2w/enphase_energy_enph_preearnings_feb_9_extensive_dd/gmm0g40/,0.025,0.839,0.136,0.9689

2420,IQ," Thank you for the clarification and insight. 

During the research we looked at the products of Enphase and Solar and quickly realized that this is a zero-sum game. Panels either need a microinverter or optimizer. When doing a quick google search, we concluded that the microinverters are more superior compared to the optimizers. 

This in combination with the background of the company, the mangement team and new products (Microinverter IQ 8 and 9 which are in the pipeline), we decided to bet on Enphase.

2429,IMO," They had to cut profits to remain a financially viable option and ride out the turbulence to maintain market share. Now they are in a position to dominate. Hence the stock price relative to earnings. They should be able to ""responsibly"" price their units now, deliver product, and earnings should fall into line.

Micros and optimizers are not a zero-some game. Old-school ""string"" or central"" inverters are still the best solution for most wide-open, optimal facing systems. Also most ground mounted arrays should use string inverters because of distance to electrical box. 

SolarEdge uses these ""string"" inverters in their system and is the ""weak link"" in their design IMO. That string inverter need replaced every 10-12 years and the system is down until replaced.  That inverter needs to be ""sized"" to the number of panels and wattage. Its gonna be a shitshow when these start failing in a couple years.

>“While Sarepta’s mission to rapidly advance treatments for rare and often fatal genetic disease is focused, unwavering and undeterred, we cannot ignore the impact of this global pandemic on human health, and have answered the call to contribute our scientific expertise and provide our technology in the race to develop an effective treatment for COVID-19. Indeed, we have already built and manufactured therapeutic PPMO constructs and are providing them now to USAMRIID for testing and evaluation.”

For your addressable market assessment, the number of patients certainly matter, but so does pricing and expected market penetration. Some of the smaller indications allow for premium pricing so total $ achievable is actually quite high.

It's kinda complicated, but in general, people using those extremely strong drugs need to be monitored. Thus they need to come into the clinic anyway regularly.

But obviously it could be a benefit. That's why I need to do more DD, because for example with paclitaxel IV you get tons of pretreatment before even getting the chemo. Iv fluids, antiemetics, cortisone and so on.

Interestingly in the one at least somewhat bigger study (still too small to say), data implied oral paclitaxel would have higher tumor response rate, thus making it the more efficient drug (AKA kills cancer better). That would be very very important, if side effects are manageable.

You meet an attractive person, but like the majority of americans have no unique interests or skills, and neither does your date. You ask them ""eyy you wanna do a thing""

WHAT ARE THE THINGS?

1. Restaraunts
2. Bars
3. Movies

Anything in those sector that had capital enough to ride it through the last year is gonna ride a wave of collective relief coming out of this pandemic.

That's it. The basic date trifecta. It has remained unchanged for literally hundreds of years through war, famine, and economic collapse. Despite all we lazy millenials doing our netflix-and-chills with avocado toast in the morning and shit, it will remain the basic date trifecta.

It is normalcy, and a normalcy people are ACHING to get back to as vaccines get handed out and people can start feeling like its safe to poke holes in the bottom of popcorn buckets again.

Combine that with the fact that AMC, the size that it is isn't going to pull a blockbuster and go ""nah these new competing technologies are a fad""

2542,NYC," I think there's something to this. If you think back to the turn of the millennium, there was actually a piracy effect that made people MORE interested in seeing films in theaters because so many people were talking about them. And the film experience really does have something different to offer. 

I think the real question is whether this can be done in a way that makes money for the theater. It might be an issue where something like that is viable in a limited way - for specific movies in specific markets. For example, Mank might have worked for NYC and LA.

I'm curious if something like 6 Underground could have worked in more markets and had more cachet if it had opened first in limited theaters with a 1-month window. The streamers generally do a shit job of marketing their movies, and I think they're missing out on library value by not mounting a big campaign and releasing into theaters.",paradisefound,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfiug0/extra_dumb_question_about_amc/gmmksfo/,0.058,0.86,0.081,0.5894

And guess what they like to do...  go out to eat, go to concerts and go to the movies.   A shared experience is still valued beyond most things.   It’s why companies like mandolin are betting on the wrong things.   AMC and it’s theaters will be back.

2544,NYC," Well first things first, I can tell you that I've run surveys directly on movie-going, and in the short-term (18 months to 2 years after the pandemic ends), we're going to see an explosion of movie-going. To the extent that people who previously were buying perhaps 1 movie ticket a year are going to buy several tickets per year - and that's without consideration of whatever the new, more blockbuster-laden schedule will be. So I fully expect a bump in AMC's stock over that time period.

Second, variable pricing is actually really popular, and while it would take some math, I think there's a way to make it work.

Third, you have to understand that theaters are actually sitting on quite a lot of consumer data that they're actually shit at doing anything with. I'd start building an algorithm (probably best to use a neural network) and institute regional booking. I mean, ideally, also build algorithmic negotiating by theater in order to optimize revenue and localized pricing. The reason theaters are  doing so poorly right now (and why studios won't release their biggest movies) is because LA and NYC account for a huge proportion of revenues and they're not open. This is actually not just because people are streaming shit now, but also because Hollywood has gotten really bad at programming content for regional audiences - so in addition to using an algorithm for booking, I'd also sell a report on regional ticket sales to the studios.

I'd also push for better programming/curation in general. Horror audiences, for example, are particularly good for theaters because they have a strong sense of community and like watching with other horror fans. But there's only a couple horror movies per month and many are duds. So I'd push for programming more horror classics. 

In the very long term, I think they're going to need to think about which theaters are really profitable and sell some to independent operators. But I also think that very long term life of theaters depends on raising up a new generation of kids to see movies in theaters. So more parent screenings with special arrangements for the kids (there's details but honestly my fat fingers are getting tired).

Anyways, there's shit that could be done. More than this, even.",paradisefound,1,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfiug0/extra_dumb_question_about_amc/gmmeko1/,0.084,0.82,0.095,-0.0936
