First off, WSB as much as I joined Reddit for WSB and enjoy the sub, has no room to call any other investing sub a pump and dump, even more so, CLF when they have legit numbers to back up their  attention. This all boils down to a former WSB member (I think he was a mod) that they banished for his thesis on steel which has been coming true. But then when it was picked up by other people they kept saying pump and dump because they failed to do their DD themselves to figure out that CLF is up like 300% since last year, steel futures are at ridiculously high prices and futures are high so far out that this company will turn into a fucking cash printing machine. And instead of posting to say they were wrong, the mods just stopped banning the ticker and tried to fly under the radar because so many people are now interested in making money in a legit company that is primed and ready for a massive increase in stock price over the near and long term

u/PowerOfTenTigers the thing you have to understand is that you almost certainly won't get rich off shares. sharemarkets trend upwards, so they're moneymakers, but slowly. options are the get rich ones, and they're just gambling.

248,CRU," I work in this industry and the common take from the service centers is that we should expect the CRU to trend downward through Q4 and find a new tariffed-normal into Q1 of 2022. 

We don‚Äôt expect to hit $30/cwt again for a long time, and expect the mills to be able to thread the higher-price needle for some time. 

I‚Äôm in manufacturing, but not automotive. Part of the skyrocketing prices since last September were tariffs, but also some unexpected maintenance and striking, which the mills used as cover to drive the pricing higher since they didn‚Äôt make jack-shit during covid. 

From early September until around May, it wasn‚Äôt a question of what you would pay for steel, it was if you could get it. That‚Äôs mostly died down now as manufacturers have hedged along the way and have some excess inventory and also mill production has started to catch up. 

The service centers have largely eaten this along the way, but it‚Äôll look up for them as the CRU declines and their decently-sized manufacturers are on lagging-average CRU programs (manufacturers will be buying higher than market for a while from the service centers as the CRU declines). 

Anyway, all that to say I think you‚Äôre pretty spot-on in your assessment overall, especially on this company, though I think there might be some opportunity to short steel along the way.

The thesis is that the float, or more than the float is owned by retail - yes. But your point doesn‚Äôt really make sense to me here. The markets work because stocks change hands at agreed upon prices. The supply of these stocks may be limited, but it isn‚Äôt that they ‚Äúrun out‚Äù like a store might run out of cookies. If the lowest someone is willing to sell a share of GME at was $5000 then the next purchase should go through at $5000, a broker shouldn‚Äôt ever get to shut off buying because they deem this price unreasonable. That isn‚Äôt for them to decide, it is for the market to decide. This is the essence of the free market and it is exactly this integrity that Robinhood along with some other brokerages ruined when they stopped allowing one side of the transaction.

As for Robinhood helping out hedge funds, I can‚Äôt prove it, but the ongoing investigations by the feds tells me that perhaps the theory deserves a little more credibility than dismissing it as a Reddit tinfoil hat thing. The theory is pretty simple, RH‚Äôs whole business model survives on the payment for order flow they get from Citadel. Citadel ‚Äúinvests‚Äù like 2B into a completely failing Melvin capital, right in the middle of the GME Fiasco. From here, the assumption is that this wasn‚Äôt an investment where any kind of return was expected, but instead a way to allow Melvin to post margin so as to not start the squeeze, which would hurt Citadel who has a short position (speculation).

It seems like we basically have the same conclusion that Robinhood is shitty so I‚Äôm not really trying to argue but instead just provide some context.

Additional reasons why people particular hate Vlad/RH:

- says it wasn‚Äôt a liquidity issue. I don‚Äôt even know how he could say that with a straight face when the fact of not being able to post margin to the DTCC sounds like the definition of a liquidity issue

- blames the DTCC for the reason they had to restrict. DTCC later says that the decision was completely internal to RH and that they actually ended up waving the collateral requirement so basically there was no reason they had to restrict

Solid info but some questions. Disclosure: I was in STIC for a while when SIR_JACKS_ALOT or whatever his username is decided to use it for a pump and dump basically. 

They have 1.1 million subscribers for a 94.4% retention based on your DD. What is the average subscription length? How is retention calculated here? What is their retention for a 6-month box? What about a 12-month?

What do you think they can do better than Chewy? Chewy has Goody Boxes, and while not technically a subscription, you can do auto-delivery and pick your own timeframe, not just monthly. What does BarkBox offer currently that Chewy doesn't/won't be able to? 

Not saying there isn't a play here but if there is it's longer term. And if they're just going to pump money in marketing I imagine it will be difficult to outcompete Chewy and offer competitive prices. Just my thoughts though!

4) UWMC initiated a buyback authorization of roughly 45% of the float at the time of the earnings, when the SP was ridiculously low at roughly 6.23. The man said on the earnings call at the day after that hew was a buyer, and they'd start the next day.

1) The short interest fee was high for a significant period of time. It's still elevated. This is just for IBKR, but you can see it here: [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/UWMC](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/UWMC) 

2) The company is making a significant amount of money (note: profit). Note how it was that way for both VW and UWMC. That means they had no reason to dilute themselves.

3) UWMC had a dividend, and a high one of 40 cents a year at that. Note that this means that the potential payoff was limited due to it, and that if they wanted to keep their sales sold short on the ex dividend payout date they were on the hook for the payment.

4) UWMC initiated a buyback authorization of roughly 45% of the float at the time of the earnings, when the SP was ridiculously low at roughly 6.23. The man said on the earnings call at the day after that hew was a buyer, and they'd start the next day.

5) THE SP was brought ridiculously low, into the low 6's. Which was roughly 4 times forward earnings 2022, or less. Note that the yield got higher, so shorts who piled on (and they did) had to contend with a higher yield.",Hani95,5,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ochpzr/this_is_why_you_do_your_own_research_a/h3ujo1x/,0.081,0.873,0.046,-0.8594
1065,GM," Nobody is going to buy Lordstown vehicles. Customers buy vehicles from companies that will be around in the future for ongoing service and maintenance. 

Think SAAB circa 2010. They practically had to give the cars away... and that included ongoing service from GM. Everybody knows Lordstown ain't gonna make it, especially because they're focused on the commercial electric market, and Ford just released a better, more focused, higher quality, and more affordable product.

1066,GME," I just feel bad for their families, like the dude who put his life savings into options on RKT earnings only to have the stock tank. Dude's wife had a baby due 2 weeks from when he had posted. 

I don't mind bets, and i do options, but WSB originally was all about biotech companies where the catalysts/clinical trials would either make or break you. Hence, the whole bets/martin shkrehli thing. Obviously there were other plays but people actually made intelligent plays with a underlying thesis/hypothesis.

Even DFV's bet was on a turnaround play, and he bought leaps to give himself time. It was a bet that GME wouldn't go bankrupt.

1068,UWMC," I trimmed my share count for a nice profit as I was way over-weighted on UWMC. However, I let roughly 1200 shares to hold for life at a cost basis of 7.51. If it goes below my cost basis, I'll be purchasing more because it's an amazing company at that price point. 

The reason I'm bullish on this company's ability to make me money is simple:. Covered Calls + Diidend: [https://gyazo.com/471f922b6264239ddcf90edf2dfe074e](https://gyazo.com/471f922b6264239ddcf90edf2dfe074e) 

I'll probably stop at somewhere around 1600-2400 shares depending on how low the share price goes. Getting my cost basis to 7 or lower on an acquisition basis would be stellar.

1124,AMD," Just do some basic analysis. The price was sitting at \~10 dollars for a while, and then shot up to 50 dollars. That's a 500% increase. Every 1 dollar it moves, you make about 400 dollars. The thing about stocks though is increases are exponential, not linear. In other words, to move 500% from 10 to 50 took about 20 billion dollars, but to move 500% again, it would take 225 billion dollars. That means the likelyhood of this happening is very low. Remember, prices are not objective markers in space. GME going to 500 dollars did not even take 100 billion, it was only valued around 60 at that price and it only lasted for a few seconds. 

If you honestly think a struggling movie company that was on the decline even before Covid is going to be worth more than AMD, a successful processor manufacture who is helping massive corporations like Google and Amazon shape the modern world, then by all means, stay in for the return. But realistically how much more do you think you are going to get out of this? You made 20 grand. To get another 20 grand you need to risk probably losing at least 15 grand over time minimum. You can put a stop loss and let it ride but that has it's own associated risk. You can also do as other suggest here and sell calls against these but that also has a downside risk. 

You can try to eek out a few extra thousand by selling to close at a different strike and turning it into a fixed trade, where you stand to for example make an extra xxxk but also lose that much and no matter what you secure some amount of it, but honestly because you are here asking this question in the first place

‚ÄúIt was also found that Covaxin demonstrated 100% efficacy against severe Covid-19.

In that regard, obviously you can‚Äôt do any better than that result. It‚Äôs not every day that you hear ‚Äú100% efficacy‚Äù mentioned in a clinical trial context.

Plus, there‚Äôs something else. Evidently, Covaxin was found to have 70% efficacy against asymptomatic infections. This is significant as it tends to suggest that Covaxin prevents transmissions.‚Äù
