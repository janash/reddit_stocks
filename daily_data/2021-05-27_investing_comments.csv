0,RH," If I remember right, Acorns seems cool in theory. Don't they just round off your spending to the next dollar or so and deposit that to a brokerage account? Been seeing lots of ads for them again recently, this must be why.

but I already contribute to my retirement plans and traditional investment account with money that I have budgeted for it. Having another account to sweep up the change doesn't seem worth while, but maybe I'm wrong?

Are financials for Acorn published yet? How about client assets?

Looking at their site now, it doesn't even look like you can choose your own positions to average into, just there plans. 

And supposing you manage to contribute $30 per month from your spare change/spending, and they charge a buck a month fee, you're paying an astronomical amount compared to what you'd pay with an ETF portfolio you built yourself and had at Fidelity or even (shudder) RH. And then the ETF's themselves have fees too...

That way, spending on things like a bubble hockey machine seems separate and not a dumb use of ""my"" money as I have departed from it in my head already. Definitely not for everyone, but I like it.

I see a lot of people saying it is more expensive than a savings account, but with any sort of balance (even $100) your monthly market gains minus the $1 are likely to outpace a meager sub 1% interest rate from any savings account.

20,SNOW," Glad I sold when I did.  The appetite for very richly valued growth that there was in abundance/excess last year just isn't there at all now. It's back to about where I first bought.

Another one is C3 (AI) - bought a little when it IPO'd, thought maybe I'd build a position if it went lower but instead sold two days later after it soared. Thought was already expensive but kept going and going. Oh well. You can see in February when the appetite for these kinds of names just turned off - there's a name that's lost 63% since February. But it's still not cheap at 34X sales.  Last year and early this year it was a total focus on growth stories and particularly ""disruptive"" growth stories. 

The second that that went away there was no support for these sorts of things and while there could certainly be bounces after the action in recent months I don't know that the kind of appetite to the degree that you saw for it last year is coming back any time soon. There's a mutual fund up 52% YTD already due in part to being short Ark and a ton of the kind of stuff that was hot last year/early this year.

And this isn't against SNOW - people clearly like the product, great CEO, etc.

Cathie Wood is being hyped on the new cover of Bloomberg Businessweek - https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E2ZDFveXIAMG_nW?format=jpg&name=large   ""The Future"" - I think people took Ark's success and the broad success of hyper growth last year as validation/confirmation of those themes rather than a year where growth had a year of excess after a decade plus of it being largely the only game in town.

21,BY," I work in data and analytics at a Media company and use Snowflake every day in my work.

I’m bullish on Snowflake because it is BY FAR, the best data warehousing product on the market by a mile. 

Most other data warehousing products out there cost a TON to use (look up teradata - they’ve struggled to grow revenue the past few years) - by cost a ton I’m meaning implementation fees alone can range in the millions of dollars, effectively locking anyone but the biggest of companies out from using their product.

Snowflake on the other hand is cheap. It’s not a SAAS product, you don’t pay subscription fees to use it. Instead, you purchase credits from snowflake (this is the $1.4B in future revenue that they already have booked), and consume these credits to run queries, import data etc into Snowflake. 

Using credits to do our day to day work explains why Snowflakes revenue retention rate is so high. Customers, like us, are constantly querying the data in our data warehouse to update business dashboards, pull reports etc. This data normally needs to be refreshed at least daily, if not multiple times a day. Every time a query is refreshed Snowflake makes money.

Given how easy it is to import data from a variety of sources, the number of business intelligence developers that we’ve employed has increased 5x because the business sees such value in a platform. No longer does it takes days or weeks to import data into Snowflake, you can have clean, transformed and ready to use data, pushing that into your business dashboards, in a matter of hours. As we move more reports away from being manual and done in excel to being automated and powered by Snowflake, our cost to use the product naturally increases over time.

The reason why I am bullish on Snowdlake is because there target market is SO LARGE. They have under 5000 customers WORLDWIDE, who use their product. For reference, the media company I work for is SMALL (i’m based in New Zealand), and we probably spend roughly 30k per year on Snowflake for all our data warehousing needs.

Think of mega cap companies, like Coca Cola, Walmart, Home Depot etc and think about the VOLUME of data that they have! Billions of rows of operational data that is ONLY INCREASING OVER TIME. Think of the number of disparate systems - CRM, accounting, billing, procurement etc, and think about the need for having this data in a place where analysts across a business can query one place for the business source of truth.

Think also about how the amount of data over time is only going to increase as become more of an interconnected world - IOT, more data being consumed over the internet, automated cars, robots - all are going to require that data to be stored somewhere and used at a later date - that’s what Snowflake does.

Literally, they could stop growing their customer numbers and their revenue would still grow 60%+ per year as their existing customers become more integrated with the warehouse and query it more and more.

From a technical perspective, sure they’re competing against the likes of Amazon, Microsoft and Google, but these products are SHIT compared to the godliness of Snowflake. Literally, the ability to query 320million rows of data in a query in Snowflake that takes 6 minutes to run vs 6 HOURS in Azure.

As a professional in the industry, I will not promote any product other than Snowflake to a future business that I work for if they don’t yet have a data warehouse. This is only going to amplify over time as the people using the product become the spokespeople for it - because Snowflake is THAT GOOD.

So yes, from an investment perspective, Snowflake is HELLA expensive. 60x TTM sales is ridiculous, regardless of the growth rate of the company. However, if you begin to consider the total number of customers that can use them (because their revenue is usage rather than subscription based, both large and small customers can easily use them -  no other product allows for this), the fact that data levels are only going to increase over time, and the fact that their product is clearly superior to everything else on the market, you can see why they are valued so richly.

* US has outperformed the most of the world and Europe the last few decades.

* Valuations based on P/E have been less effective the last few decades and that's why traditional value investors have been getting killed on the markets ([and literally](https://www.barrons.com/articles/legendary-value-manager-charles-de-vaulx-found-dead-51619564407)) the last couple of decades. 

* One reason why those traditional valuations didn't work is because those traditional metrics like P/E, debt ratios, or book ratios don't work very well with valuing the high P/E growth tech stocks. That same investing style would tell you to generally invest in undervalued ""cheap"" stocks. However, the world doesn't work that way anymore. 

* Tech advances quicker and quicker has ever more disruptive. Those traditional value stocks will look better and better on paper the more they get disrupted because traditional metrics like P/E will say a stock like Circuit city or RadioShack is selling at a discount and that Amazon at 1000x P/E is overpriced. But reality is CC & RS have low P/Es because people don't want to buy companies that are going to get disrupted and killed by AMZN. GOOG with traditional media, AMZN with SEARS, NFLX on T, and TSLA on the autos.

* Judging by how things have been going. I don't see this disruption trend changing. And on that point, I still believe US will be the tech leader over most countries. Maybe not beating out every specific country in regions like Asia Pacific on every industry, but certainly one of the top players globally. If you're buying a basket of the World-VS-US, then I will likely pick the US to outperform it in the area of tech, disruption, and growth.

I believe that tech leadership coupled with growing population demographics, stability of the legal/financial systems, and strong global position allow the US to maintain it's strong gains as further disruptions continue. More innovative than Europe. More stable than China or India. More resources than the rest of Asia Pacific.

Some markets like those in EU, London, Brazil,  the rest of LatAM, and others have been laggards and might have a short term outperformance rally relative to US equities.

61,FCF," Yes, that's why I specified a low payout ratio and solid FCF. Dividend cuts are typically the last to happen during a crisis because companies don't want to lose the shareholders who invested specifically for the yield. Even during covid the handful of companies which cut their dividends were often completely shut down and on the verge of bankruptcy or were not financially strong going into the crisis.

One thing about Amazon is they're willing to try and also don't try to force a loosing hand and will tie it off.

67,RE," Some people might, but I don't think this is a good idea for most people. It's an interesting idea to save in a ""city-indexed real estate fund"" as a way to track RE appreciation in your market, but even within a city, property values can vary quite a bit. It is hard to execute well in real estate. There aren't many details provided in that link, but I imagine these are most likely going to be crowd funded private investments, and nothing like publicly traded REITs or ETFs.

First, the idea of ""indexing"" to your neighborhood while saving for a home doesn't entirely hold up. When you are saving, you mostly only need to worry about the purchase price of the home. But when you own a piece of real estate, there is more to real estate return than just the appreciation (or depreciation) of property price. You're forgetting rent, repairs, management, taxes, maintenance, etc., which you would account for while investing in real estate.

Drawbacks are obvious when compared to publicly traded REITs. Concentrated bets, high fees, illiquid, limited fund/manager track record, conflicts of interest (property manager?). Investors taking concentrated bets usually want to know what they are buying and control or limit some of these risks. And real estate is illiquid. Without a public market, I imagine the investors in a ""city-indexed fund"" would not be free to redeem any time. If you have more money to invest, larger real estate funds and private REITs do exist. 

At this time, if you don't have a lot of money, I think the only real option is publicly traded REITs.",Creative_Dream,3,/r/investing/comments/nlrpkx/cityspecific_residential_real_estate_index_funds/gzlir4d/,0.069,0.821,0.11,0.9347

74,GDP," Good morning contrarians!

Stock futures are down a bit, with tech stocks leading the drop. Nasdaq off about 0.4%. S&P 500 about 0.2% lower. Dow Industrials down about 0.1%. That’s as of 0630.

This follows a pretty quiet day on Wall Street, with some muted gains. Disappointing earnings from Nvidia and Snowflake after the bell appear to be weighing on sentiment now, especially for tech stocks. This is preventing a breakout.

Bunch of economic data releases this morning that people will be watching in anticipation of a Fed adjustment to interest rate policy.

These all drop at 0830: Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) prices are the Fed’s preferred gauge of inflation. Core prices are expected to have increased by 2.3% in Q1, the same as in Q4. If that number beats the upside then watch out for inflation and tapering talk. 

Durable goods orders should shed some light on supply chain constraints as well as demand from manufacturers. Expectations are for 0.8% print for core orders, down from the 2.3% level in March. 

It’s Thursday, so we also get initial jobless claims. Economists are expecting another post-pandemic low there, of 425k. That’s a slight drop from 444k reported last week. 

There’s also a GDP print, but I don’t care about that as it’s entirely backward looking and has no impact on future direction of pretty much anything.

We also have pending home sales at 1000. Expectations there are for 0.8% increase, down from 1.9% in March.

Once these are digested, things should remain quiet ahead of the Memorial Day Weekend holiday here in the US.",The_Contrarian01,5,/r/investing/comments/nm39dt/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/gzmdzyn/,0.054,0.844,0.102,0.9392

107,GME," Short squeezes can happen. And it likely occurred back in January for GME. But today - there aren't going to be many retail traders or institutions that would risk unhedged short positions with a volatile stock like GME. So I would be surprised to see any kind of traditional short squeeze.  

A lot of the theories around a short squeeze is based on short interest and short volume data. What I've noticed is that most of the people talking about it don't actually know the difference between those datasets. And many assume that it's some kind of long term short position - which it may or may not be. 

There's also lot of bs about hurting market makers like Citadel Securities. Market makers don't care if the stock goes up or down. They make money when there's a market to be made - ie. that's why they are called market makers. 

For me - GME is simply an interesting exercise into mob mentality. I'll continue to extract premium income from trading GME whenever there is high volatility but what I'm doing is not investing. I'm sure there are other people like me doing it. But people like me don't really care if GME is going up or down.",greytoc,3,/r/investing/comments/nm39dt/daily_general_discussion_and_spitballin_thread/gznmsxa/,0.068,0.817,0.115,0.8902

123,IMO," short answer is yes,  but long answer might be more helpful for others who haven't researched any of this:

VTI tracks the broad US stock market as it is actually weighted. It is a good baseline/core position especially when added to  VXUS which is its ""except US"" global market counterpart.  The world stock markets are right now about 66% US for actual weighting.  VOO tracks S&P 500 which is an overweight to Mega Cap US, which right now, in this part of this bull market is IMO a good overweight.  VXF is everything US besides S&P so it is a complement to VOO; you can build VTI out of VOO+VXF.  what % you assign everything is up to you, but S&P 500 represents about 71% of US market cap today.  

The global market has historically produced good inflation beating returns on every 30 year period measured, which leads to the reasoning that time in the market is better than ""timing the market.""  One way to beat ""the market"" is to put wise overweights in place that outperform the broader market during a given market cycle.  this particular bull has seen Tech, Health Care and US outperform.  the final third of bull markets (which is what I think we are in) lends itself to outperformance from mega cap and consumer discretionary.

Despite bonds being part of everyone's standard advice, the macro for bonds has never been worse with interest rates sitting so low.  if interest rates go up, current bonds become worth less in principal to traders, so they can, and likely will, lose money instead of just returning income.  For investors with long time horizons (20+ years) they tend to be a portfolio drag rather than an enhancement.

131,VERY," Share splits are VERY different from secondary share issues. Splits just cut the pie pieces smaller. Secondaries make more pie pieces and sell them to new people - in theory it shouldn't affect share price if sold at a fair price, but in practice, a lot of times secondaries are from a position of weakness and desperation.

Tesla did both last year. The split seemed to boost the price a bit, in this case there are practical issues in buying and selling shares that are in the hundreds of dollars each - lots of people, myself included, can not buy fractional shares (nor want to). My personal pet peeve is when some companies do 3-for-2 splits... WTF... PITA for math, and it doesn't really make the shares more accessible.

The secondaries Tesla did did not hurt the share price at all really... they sold shares for a lot of money for relatively little dilution, at a time when they didn't strictly need more cash, but it's quite handy to have billions in the bank when they are spending billions on multiple new factories.

I also am very much on the buy/hold side for over 1 year as I rarely enter a trade with a short term mindset. I'd likely try rolling these forward if they finish below my strike, but they are companies I feel comfortable with owning.

Some examples:

HYLN - $9, 6/18 & $7.5, Jan-22

FUBO - $17.5, 6/18 & $20, Jan-22

IPOE - $15, Jan-22

RKT - $21.89 - 6/18 (This one went against me big time last earnings call)

MNMD $2.5, Jan-22

Part of my rationale on the longer dated puts is it also gives me another \~8 months of earning to put more money into my brokerage. If they were each exercised today (only one is ITM so not a likely scenario) I'd be just short on the cash side. I don't tend to dip into margin, but I'll slightly cross over with CSPs.",clev3211,2,/r/investing/comments/nmg03n/selling_cash_secured_puts/gzogyoy/,0.022,0.922,0.056,0.8271
