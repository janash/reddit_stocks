1,ARVL, For what? I‚Äôve done that with BDRBF and LKNCY. I go in after doing my kind of DD and liking the company and seeing a vision and after a week of stagnation I move out because I don‚Äôt have diamond hands. And a few weeks or months later it ‚Äúskyrocket‚Äù. Right now I‚Äôm in ARVL (no penny) but average at $17.08 so hoping for a move by 2023 if I can hold that much.,Loose_Mail_786,2,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/oepj6d/the_current_age_of_private_jets_is_ending/h48yn9z/,0.0,0.861,0.139,0.8391

7,HUT," HUT 8 Mining!! Hut8 is mining with 1073 PH/s and they have over 3000 bitcoins on their books. That is a lot. So far only RIOT and Bit have higher hashing capabilities. Their operating costs vary though. Last quarter was financially well. They have one of the best Price to Sales ratios and will upgrade to 1300 PH/s. Now of course, compared to RIOT or MARA they are small, but given their Market Cap in comparison their valuation imo is too low. They also focus on ESG, which is substantial. But here they could do more I think. Overall, the bitcoin price is decisive and I believe it will rise mid and certainly long term. Which will ultimately benefit HUT.",Many-Coach6987,0,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/oejhbj/daily_discussion_thread/h47r3zd/,0.063,0.813,0.124,0.7985

15,DD," At first glance itll look like a bust but if you do some DD on what's going on in China with tutoring and education programs it'll make a little more sense. Take $EDU, $TAL and $GOTU for example. They've all taken a heavy hit from this. I don't expect them all to get back to their original price before the drops but I believe there's some good profit to be made for long term. Or if your looking short term then some puts could be possible.",0o0m0n0y0o0,1,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/oejhbj/daily_discussion_thread/h4a8b6l/,0.0,0.861,0.139,0.9081
