0,DD," Ok, mega big comment here. If you like the ideas, upvote this, if not, downvote. Since we want penny stocks, we will put the price under 7$. Next, we most likely want a low float, so letâ€™s say under 10M. Average volume should be above 500K, and RSI should be at 40, so a bit oversold.
This personally gives me 8 tickers. $AMPG $CLEU $GOVX $JZXN $RCON $SJ $TAOP $TIRX. They have all gone down on Friday, and RCON has a volume of 3.094 Million. The average volume of RCON is 4.43 MIL.

3,DD," To whoever said Finviz isnâ€™t the end all be all, I totally agree. We should all do our own DD.

6,DD," This is a good start and something to get people thinking. I also play with Debt of a company, as a lot of discussion has shifted to fundamentals coming back with the rise of interest rates on the horizon. But this is also just a way to expose you to companies. Doing this once a week will get you different tickers each time. So donâ€™t take this as a get rich quick trade, but a way to do DD on companies that are oversold and have promise to turnaround (via earnings or catalysts).",WaterGruffalo,1,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/odn8qb/best_finviz_screener_for_penny_stocks/h427slg/,0.038,0.82,0.142,0.8705

16,IMO," Have you realized any gains or losses?  If not, what's your criteria for selling? But yes, certainly you are off to a great start IMO. That is a crazy stretch in the market - insane run followed by major pullback. That's a good number of stocks you're holding; depending on strategy, some would struggle to stay on top of them enough to trade optimally.
