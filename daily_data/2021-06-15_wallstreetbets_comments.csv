28,AMC," OK it's really pretty easy. Imagine you want to buy a house that is worth $100,000. You put down a down-payment of 5%, or $5000.

Now let's say a month later you've done the appraisal and all the paperwork is ready and it's time to buy. But during that month something indirectly happened that affected the value of the house. 

Maybe Disney announced they were building a new park nearby and the value of the house doubled.
Maybe the city announced they were building a sewage plant nearby and the value of the house plummeted.

Either way, you've already got an option to buy the house at the $100,000 agreed on a month ago regardless of what the price is today. Notice I said option. You don't actually have to.

In the 1st example where the value went up, you can buy the house for $100,000 even though it's worth $200,000, instantly pocketing $100,000 profit in equity. Maybe Beyonce buys the house across the street and the house you wanted goes up to $5 million *in value*. The *cost* remains the same to you. You still get to buy it for $100,000. In theory the price of the house could skyrocket to any amount and you'd still only have to pay $100,000 since you secured that price when you put down the down payment. The possibilities for profit are endless, the sky is the limit. 

In the 2nd example where the price went down and they're building a sewage plant nearby, you decide you don't want the house anymore. You're not required to buy it, but you forfeit your down payment and lose $5000. No matter how much the value of the house has dropped, you can't possibly lose more than your $5000 down payment. 

So while the possible profits are infinite, the possible losses are capped at your initial down payment. 

Let's use that extreme example; Beyonce moves in next door and the house is worth $5 million now. You decide you just want the cash, you don't even care about the house. You want to pocket the money and you can go buy a different house. You sell the option to buy the house at $100,000 to someone else for say $4.6 Million. Not quite the full $5 million because they still have to buy the house, there's a lot of paperwork, etc. You never even owned the house, all you ever owned was the option to buy the house, but you sold that option to someone else and made a huge profit because you were smart (or lucky) and secured that option when the price was low.

This is almost exactly what call options are, with the most significant difference being that your 'down payment' is not applied to the cost of the stock if you choose to buy it. Instead it's paid like a fee for the privilege of buying the option. Otherwise it's pretty much the same. You buy an option today to lock in the price (called a strike price) to buy the stock next week, next month, or whenever you choose. If you locked in a price lower than the stock is actually worth you can either buy the stock at that lower price, or sell your option and let someone else buy the stock at that strike price. If the stock goes down below the strike price, you don't have the buy the stock, you just lose your deposit. So the profit potential is limitless, but your potential loss is capped at your deposit fee.

So let's look at a call option example using simple numbers.

Today's AMC price is $50. You think it will go up to $100 by next Friday. With a traditional long sale you just buy the stock at today's price and hope it goes up. If it's $100 next Friday you've made $50. If it's $200 you've made $150. If it's $10 you've lost $40. This is how you currently buy stock. The problem is your potential earnings is limited to how many shares you can afford to actually buy, and your potential loss is... well you could lose everything if the business goes bankrupt.

This is the beauty of call options. Options are pretty cheap, and you don't have to actually buy the shares. I can buy an option to buy 100 shares for a deposit fee of anywhere between maybe $1 to $15. Even though I don't have enough money to buy 100 shares, I do have enough money to pay for an option, knowing I have no intention of actually buying the stock. Instead, if the price of the stock moves up above what I guessed it would and what I have the option of paying (the strike price), I can sell the option to someone else who can afford to buy the stock. They're happy to buy it because they're getting the stock at less than market price, and I'm happy to make money selling the option. If my prediction was wrong, I'm not on the hook for buying the shares, I just forfeit my deposit.... times 100. Wait what? Times 100?! Yes but wait it's not as bad as it sounds. 1 option allows you to buy up to 100 shares, however you pay the deposit on each share if you buy the stock, and you forfeit the deposit on each share if you don't. It's not that bad though if you consider you could be buying stock at way below market value. 

So let's look at the example above again. If AMC is $50 today, and I think it will be $100 next Friday. I don't have enough money to buy many shares but I do have enough money to buy an option to buy the stock for $50 per share (the strike price) any time until the end of the day next Friday, that option only costs me a $10 deposit fee. That's all I need to put down today. Now if I'm right, and the price hits $100 next Friday, I could buy up to 100 shares for $50 each plus that $10 deposit on each share for a total of $60 per share. That $10 deposit seems steep times 100 but remember the stock is worth $100 so if I do exercise my option to buy all 100 shares I've made a $40 profit on each one.

$50 strike price +$10 deposit fee X 100 = $6000 cost to buy 100 shares
Value $100 per share X 100 = $10,000
Profit $4,000

Well why not just buy the 100 shares today for $50 each? You could, let's consider that.

$50 X 100 = $5000
Value $100 per share X 100 = $10,000
Profit $5,000

At first glance it seems like it simply makes more sense to just buy the stock and not bother with the call options at all. In this particular case with these particular numbers that would have been the smarter choice. But what if the value didn't go to $100? Let's look at some other scenarios.

First let's simply say you don't have $500 today to buy the 100 shares but you are expecting to have money next Friday. Well you could buy the shares next Friday but by then they're up to $100 each remember? You can only afford 50 shares instead of $100 and you have $0 profit. In this case where you don't have money right now, buying a call option today to lock in the price for next Friday would have been your better choice since you'd have 100 shares and $4000 profit instead of 50 shares and $0 profit.

What if you don't have $5000 to buy in today and you won't have $5000 by next Friday? Well remember you don't actually have to buy the stock. You can sell the option to someone else and let them buy it. You can buy an option today for just $10 and sell it before the end of the day next Friday for a profit as long as the share price hasn't dropped below the strike price + deposit fee. If it goes to $100 you'll be able to sell for somewhere around $2000. You don't get the full $10,000 of course because the guy you sell the option to still has to actually buy the stock himself. But still you can make a ton by selling your option as long as it's still at a profit (in the money). Worst case scenario it drops below the strike price you locked in and you are required to forfeit the deposit times 100 for a total loss of $1000. But that's the maximum you could lose, even if the stock drops to zero you're not required to buy it, you can't lose more than your deposit times 100 shares. While it seems like a big risk, your risk is capped, and the potential profits are ridiculous for very little investment. 

Some other factors to consider are determining the strike price and the expiration, as these both affect your deposit fee.

If the stock is at $50 today and you choose a strike price of $50, the deposit is kind of high ($10 per share) because there's a very good chance you will make a profit.
If the stock is at $50 today and you choose a strike price of $100, the deposit is lower (maybe $6 per share) because it's less likely that the price will go that high and your risk of losing your deposit is higher.
If the stock is at $50 today and you choose a strike price of $150, the deposit is much lower (maybe $3 per share) because it's very likely the price will not hit $150 per share and you will lose your deposit. 

The maximum strike price you can choose is capped at roughly 300% of the current share price.

You can actually choose a strike price *lower* than than today's price, however the deposit is extremely expensive because it's very likely that the price won't drop below the strike price. For example you can actually buy an option to buy AMC shares for 50¢ each! But it costs almost a $60 deposit fee PER SHARE, lol.

If the call option expires and you haven't sold it, your broker will automatically exercise it for you if you have enough buying power in your account. Otherwise it will automatically sell it for you. If the price has dropped below the strike price, the cost of the deposit times 100 will be deducted from your account.",working_joe,930,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o04s3t/still_holding_my_amc_calls_they_expire_this/h1tqusk/,0.067,0.783,0.151,0.9995

30,AMC," At close AMC was at $57 and you could have sold $12 calls for $45.35.

So you could have sold the calls for $45,350, and used that plus the $12,000 you used to exercise to buy 1000 shares for $57,000, and had $350 left over.  You still have 1000 shares but you also have an extra $350 cash.

Basically you just gifted whoever was assigned your options $350 out of your pocket.  Citadel thanks you for your donation (ok, we don't know that a MM got assigned, but you get my point)

That $350 was the time value of the options.  Any time you exercise early you throw that time value away.

46,AMC," A call is a contract that gives you the ability to purchase 100 shares at a price you choose before a date you choose. A put is a contract that does the same but gives you the option to sell at a price you choose before a date you choose.

So what OP did above:

A call contract is a ""bundle"" of 100 shares, and OP paid (on average) $2.14/share/contract, meaning, $2.14x100 shares $214, and OP holds 50 contracts, bringing the initial value to somewhere around $10,700.

Op could sell them right now (at time of the screenshot) at market value for $30.32/share, which is where the $151,625 comes from.

Op could also exercise the contracts, meaning exercising OPs contractual right to buy 100 shares at $40/share (strike price), no matter what the market price is.

Last week I got a BB one for like $0.40, which means about $40 (As there are 100 of them in the contract). I did that just to see how they work and was willing to lose the $40 if it did not pay off.  


It did not pay off, they expired worthless. At least it was only $40 and not a yolo... Or maybe that WAS my version of a YOLO lol.  


So this week, I am repeating my mistake and buying another cheap one. I only had about $25 buying power in my account so wanted in on WISH. I got a single Jun18th @ $20 strike at a price of $0.20. That went up to $0.50 today and I would have made $30 on my $20 if I sold it. But then it went back down to $0.25 at close.  


I am 'learning by doing' with these options. I am already learning that they lose their value very quickly when they are short expiry like this. Maybe why I see people talk about losing the options game when playing short expiry options. It was all I could afford though to get in on WISH.  


It's a lottery ticket at the end of the day. If WISH pumps tomorrow then I should probably sell that option so I can buy back in somewhere with longer duration options.

I started trading or ""investing"" circa 2006.  This is when a lot of the internet brokers came onto the sign were becoming well established. In 2000, fees ranged from $10 to $30 a trade and that's for online no broker trades.  By 2005, most of the big players like E-Trade(and it's baby) or TD Waterhouse(which later bought out Ameritrade to become today's TDA) were charging in the low teens if not below $10.  So this was my entry and also among many others first explosion in day trading.(Again this is my perception, I cannot recall ""day trader"" as a career before this but that may be the limits of my own experience).  Btw, this was so long ago, that YouTube didn't even exist yet. Smartphones didn't exist.  Reddit and Digg didn't exist.  The iPod was still using a hard drive.  I was trading BOA and it was around the $30-40 range. I remember watching its earning report and after spectacular news, it was up 2%.  And it was one of the high movers(there may have been bigger swings but again that is my experience).  This was roughly May/Jun 2008. Because I remember buying around $36 and watching it dropping into the mid $20s. I realized I did not know shit about anything. Btw before the end of year, it would hit a low of $3.95.  I stepped back and away from stocks for a while since I didn't have a job(income) and the rest o the money in the account wasn't supposed to be touch not that I wanted to after losing $1600 in a week when I was maybe making $100 a week just trading swings in price and honestly not knowing what the shit I was doing.

Social media(not just reddit but all the stock discords and youtubers) alongside free trades have thrown a lot of retail money not just into the market but also into trading.  I was buying BAC at $36 with commission of $13.  Spreads also seemed much wider back then due to less liquidity.  I can't recall the spread but a B/A of $35/37 doesn't seem unreasonable. That mean assuming a single purchase/sell entry/exit, the stock would have to move almost 6% for you to break even: buy at 37 and it would have to move up $2.13 for the bids to reach your cost).  Hence small timers didn't trade frequently.  Hell, I remember reading advice to diversify and buy slowly(not all at once) and thinking how the fuck am I supposed to cover these trading fees?

The free trades make it easy to trade and social media enables certain stocks to get excessive attention.

In 2019, I got a significantly higher paying job so I opened the account on the left to be an ""investory"" while my 2010 account would be a ""trading"" account. And up until 2019, I was doing well: my average return year over year was 10.71% in 2019 and averaging around ""safe"" assumption the stocks rose 5% a year.(This number I chose as this was a number I saw frequently in retirement calculations ie assume 5% return on retirement).  I also had the low benchmark of 2% as that is the average US inflation rate.  I wasn't greedy or ambitious. I just wanted my money to not get eaten by inflation. But you can see I lose $20,000 as a trader in 2020 with $120k while I made $10k investing with just $35k.

2021 is a bit different as I've taken my investing account much harder to a multi year approach so most gains/losses haven't been realized at all. But in my trading account, I'm sitting on a loss of $11,000k. Which is not bad given I was down $40k on GME alone due to Wall Street fuckery.

That mean assuming a single purchase/sell entry/exit, the stock would have to move almost 6% for you to break even: buy at 37 and it would have to move up $2.13 for the bids to reach your cost).  Hence small timers didn't trade frequently.  Hell, I remember reading advice to diversify and buy slowly(not all at once) and thinking how the fuck am I supposed to cover these trading fees?

The free trades make it easy to trade and social media enables certain stocks to get excessive attention.  

I've stayed away from trading for a long time by just finding companies I liked and buying those:

This is a personal record of my trading accounts since 2010. In 2019, I got a significantly higher paying job so I opened the account on the left to be an ""investory"" while my 2010 account would be a ""trading"" account. And up until 2019, I was doing well: my average return year over year was 10.71% in 2019 and averaging around ""safe"" assumption the stocks rose 5% a year.(This number I chose as this was a number I saw frequently in retirement calculations ie assume 5% return on retirement).  I also had the low benchmark of 2% as that is the average US inflation rate.  I wasn't greedy or ambitious. I just wanted my money to not get eaten by inflation. But you can see I lose $20,000 as a trader in 2020 with $120k while I made $10k investing with just $35k.

2021 is a bit different as I've taken my investing account much harder to a multi year approach so most gains/losses haven't been realized at all. But in my trading account, I'm sitting on a loss of $11,000k. Which is not bad given I was down $40k on GME alone due to Wall Street fuckery.

I've learned many of the investing rules don't apply well to trading but a corollary to the old adage ""Don't invest what you can't afford to lose."" is that ""Just because you can afford to lose it, doesn't mean you should.""  When GME free-falled from the $400s, I was distracted at work and assumed the price halts were due to my shitty wifi rather than trading halts and the TDA app doesn't tell you trading is halted.  I bought 100 at 315 before it went to 400. I tried to exit but the order didn't fill. The follow up surge to the mid-hi 200s had me wanting to exit as I thought it was going to fall much harder but I thought ""I can afford to lose all of it""  And I averaged down once it hit the 100s and below. But at $40, I was thinking ""why the fuck did I not follow my own rules for exiting?""

193,RNG," Most of the news lately tried to demolish the bull thesis saying that Total is unloading shares heavily... On seeking Alpha they also wrote a wrong headline saying that Total sold 10 million share, while the count as of 08/06 should be 6.4 million.  


Total needs to [finance the JV](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210304005231/en/Clean-Energy-and-Total-Sign-Joint-Venture-to-Develop-Carbon-Negative-Fuel-and-Infrastructure) with $CLNE, whose budget can be considered expensive for an oil major too:

  
*""The initial firm commitment is $100 million and can increase to $400 million as development opportunities progress. Since Clean Energy and Total will be providing the equity portion of the investments, the actual amount of capital invested in RNG projects may be higher than $400 million depending on the amount of leverage that is deployed. In addition, Total will be providing credit support for Clean Energy development in the RNG value chain, including $45 million for contracted RNG fueling infrastructure.""*

Why cash is so important for RNG projects? It is important because in order to win the assignation of RNG projects (whose scale is increasing over time) you need to be the highest bidder. Many are competing to get these lucrative projects (Chevron, $ENB, single small companies previously active only in the ethanol segments)

What $CLNE has that others have not is the distribution network...and look what Chevron is doing: [Chevron brands its first CNG retail site](https://www.chevron.com/stories/chevron-brands-its-first-cng-retail-site) *""Chevron U.S.A.

247,RNG," As with all things in this world, someone has come up with a ratings system. The system is called Global Warming Potential, or GWP. Basically, the higher the number, the worse it is for the environment.  
  
  
Methane, which we're making whether we want it or not, is one of the worst at a GWP of over 31. It also lasts for about 70 years. As said, ""bad juju"".  
  
  
Capture it, turn it into RNG, and throw it into a truck? The truck is emitting simple carbon, with a GWP of 1.1. Which makes RNG the single most environmentally friendly fuel in the world today. Electricity comes in, on average, with a GWP of almost 10. Green hydrogen, which everybody thinks is the ultimate future, comes in at 5.8. And both of those fuel sources require extracting something from the earth, processing it, and then using it. Doesn't matter if it's lithium, hydrogen, coal, whatever, we're taking something that was 0 and creating a positive number. RNG is taking something that started over 30, and reduced it to 1.  
  
  
The obvious counterargument somebody will make is ""well, just stop making so much methane"". That will never happen unless we as a species stop eating meat (the jokes are all about cows, but pigs, chickens, etc. all make manure, too), we all stop going to the bathroom (doll it up however you want, but humans make manure, too, and wastewater treatment plants emit methane), and stop throwing things away (landfills produce). I mean, you can try to create laws around recycling your own shit by eating it and ceasing all consumption, but I don't think it's going to work out for you.",NrdRage,127,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o00qva/bezos_cow_farts_and_you_how_amzns_deal_w_clne_is/h1slzdx/,0.075,0.868,0.057,-0.8441

You say 2 years before hydrogen and electric take over.  I wish I could just link to a comment I made that shoots that to hell, but my intern already nuked it.  So I'll summarize:

&#x200B;

There's zero hydrogen infrastructure right now.  It's going to magically appear in 2 years?  Let's not even talk about the supply chain of getting the hydrogen to the refueling stations, or building the refueling stations.  Let's just talk about how it took 12 years to get most of the Keystone laid, and that's one pipe.  We're gonna lay hydrogen all over the country in 2?

And there's still the issue that there are a lot of problems with the tech, not the least of which (at least for commercial transport) is hauling capacity.

OP's post is mostly spot-on because any of the above still contain a motivation for Amazon to see the stock price rise and stay as high above $13.49 as possible, with either an income statement motivation of profiting from the sale of shares or a balance sheet motivation of increasing the value of the equity-asset of the CLNE warrants.",Bilbo-Baggins77,4,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o00qva/bezos_cow_farts_and_you_how_amzns_deal_w_clne_is/h1t7n26/,0.04,0.755,0.205,0.9505

If CLNE can increase  ~$9.43/share over the $13.50 exercise price of the warrants during the life of the agreement (warrants are valid until 04/16/31), Amazon has covered the cost of the $500M in fuel purchased from CLNE.",Bilbo-Baggins77,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o00qva/bezos_cow_farts_and_you_how_amzns_deal_w_clne_is/h1t995n/,0.024,0.787,0.189,0.9022

So if you earn 20k in your day job, you'll just pay what the regular tax of 20% (if you're Self Employed) or 30% on PAYE, on those wages, but if you've earned 10k on  the stock market then you won't pay tax on that as its not combined with your wages and doesn't exceed the limit for CG.

Uwmc needs much more than just volume. Besides a wsb magic (which can revive bankrupt companies), there is not much going for uwmc. Moreover, how is 1% SI going to impact anything when there is literally 90M float (Current 5/28 numbers from Schwab)?

Those who bought under 8, when it was oversold had a good entry point. And saw the gains but right now it will be a slow painful bagholding experience. Specially for those who buy calls instead of buyung shares.

**EDIT 2:**

* UWMC Fintel Short Skviizee Score: 92.02 - Rank 22 out of 8977
* Nearly 1m shorts were borrowed in the morning leaving shorts available to 850,000
* Now there are 3,000,000 shorts available for borrow
* Short Borrow Fee Rate is 27.32% - shorts are paying a lot to keep UWMC down.

You say it's difficult for anyone to compete with them but *why*.  When there's this much money on the table there will be competition.  

You know why Twitter, Facebook or Instagram stay relevant?  It's not their fancy code because there's isn't any... maybe in scaling there is some,  it's that they have the users and the money from selling adverts to those users to buy emerging competition or compete in features or new products.  Microsoft dominates lots of business software by leveraging the idea of compatibility and the importance of 'it has to work for your business'. 

Is PLTR in the same place right now? I'm not sure.  I am sure they're using the same technologies as everyone else, code, internet, etc. So why can't others do the same.

770,PLTR," This is actually an interesting question. If you're addressing PLTR's involvement with the military, it's role in privacy and civil liberties, Alex Karp has fairly interesting ideologies. One of PLTR's goals is actually to protect data. One thing i failed to cover in the post is PLTR's terrific data security and segregation. It requires users to have specific permissions and authorization in order to access certain data which helps protect the data that PLTR is reasoning with. With PLTR being this powerful it allows for full control and monitoring of who has access to the data and when did they access it. This gives a lot of power to PLTR though which means you need to trust Karp. Karp mentioned in an interview ""[I didn't sign up for the government to know when I smoke a joint or have an affair](https://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2013/08/14/agent-of-intelligence-how-a-deviant-philosopher-built-palantir-a-cia-funded-data-mining-juggernaut/?sh=164275307785)"", while this is a fairly crude statement, it demonstrates his moral compass of protecting people's privacy while dealing with all this data. Karp also has a firm understanding of his rights and what's in his control as a CEO. As i quoted in the article he sued the Army for basically trying to create their own version of PLTR at a much higher price than what PLTR can offer. This action demonstrates that the leadership of PLTR is strong with their ideals and will exercise it so that powerful organizations like the military won't push them over for underhanded purposes.  Bigger question now is do you trust Karp and PLTR. I personally do after listening to quite a [few of his interviews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBlGMHiPf1U&t=1s). He's a very essentric yet strong and intelligent individual but that's my evaluation. Feel free to look into him on your own. 

Now if you're talking about PLTR's role in warfare like the speculation that the US used [PLTR to track Osama Bin Laden](https://mse238blog.stanford.edu/2017/07/jchoi8/palantir-big-data-possibly-helped-catch-bin-laden/) unfortunately that's more of a question for the US political ideologies not PLTR. PLTR is nothing more than a tool, it can be used to track terrorists or it can be used to fight a global pandemic. Alex Karp does a very good job at being selective with his clients and firm with his ideologies, but there's only so much influence Karp and Peter Thiel can do on their own. I say its a good thing that PLTR has influence over these governing bodies, but that's because I trust Karp as a CEO. 

This is my take on PLTR's ethical views, hopefully i addressed your question. If not please elaborate.",ethanplee,7,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o03gln/pltr_dd_calling_all_palantards_what_is_pltr_and/h1tonp1/,0.049,0.807,0.145,0.9875

So it proceeded to plummet to around $25 by the end of the day. But I had patience and I held on, and on Monday all of a sudden it took off towards it's current all time high. 

That might not happen so quickly with $CLNE, but if you hold strong it will. The shorts have almost exhausted their shares to short.

What we really need, is a huge group effort to put some volume out there and stop the shorts from having so much price control. They barely have anything left to fight with, all it's gonna take is us staying strong together.

I go to a casino and play poker on the tables with bad players I can win money from and I have no clue why anyone would play a slot machine or 95% of these other tables games.  And yet, the casino would not survive if everyone was like me.  Everyone is also not like you.  For everyone who thinks like you do, there are 1,000 morons willing to gamble and, since they are morons, they actually PREFER to play games with less skill and more luck.

1746,FSR," Good luck with this, just will point out that $600M cash is not enough money to get to production levels that they generate positive operating cash flow. By now you can look at NIO, TSLA, RIDE, VW, and perhaps others to realize that without a few Billion dollars they are facing a dead end.

There are too many players in this market doing too much better. And they have actual IP to back them up. Beyond Meat and Impossible are vastly superior.

Here is a telling quote from TTCF's S-1:

""As of the date of this prospectus, we do not have any issued patents and have forgone pursuing any patent applications. As a result, we cannot rely on any protection provided under applicable patent laws""

That is a huge problem. The reason that Beyond Meat and Impossible are valuable is because they can create products that no one else is allowed to create. For Impossible, their compound that uses iron ions and heme to create a bloody/meaty taste blows the competition out of the water. For Beyond, they have patents focused more on replicating a more satisfying texture. These cannot be replicated without either R&D on alternatives, or by infringing a patent.

But TTCF has no degree of protection. Cauliflower Pizza is not new. It is very gay, but not very new. The same can be said of the entirety of their portfolio of products. It's all commodity food-stuffs that any competitor can do better.

The demand for Cauliflower Wings is not that fucking high. However, the demand for something that tastes like an actual burger, without the use of beef, is extraordinarily high.

2014,CO," Devil's advocate:

EVs are kind of a sham. They will be limited in the long term to local commercial use. Otherwise they offer no practical advantage to consumers. They are more expensive and carbon intensive to build, and don't produce the expected reductions in CO output because 60% of electricity is from fossil fuels anyway. Also they are much more sensitive to materials prices in particular because of the metals and rare earths used to produce the batteries. TSLA is successful because they market to rich people, but not every consumer is going to pay for the novelty of having an EV if the premium is too big over conventional, which it will be as fake demand is propped up by propaganda and government intervention. At the end of the day people don't want something that costs more but isn't better. That's why there have been so many high profile EV failures in the speculative tech craze of the last year. Short EVs, or at least don't hold them too long.

2279,TA," Sup, WSB! I know, I know, 🐻=🌈, and nevertheless I would like to share this with you and preferably get some sweet retarded feedback, instead of 🌈🐻ishment and the downvotes!

Take a look, the TA framework of this thesis is fairly simple, is based on Fibonacci retracement, and incorporates 9 stages for both SPX 1987-2003 and 2009-2024. The Fibo measurement starts with the reversal of the previous downtrend (market crash ended) and covers the long term uptrends.

Fibonacci retracmenet is a very important instrument in TA, which is used with the purpose of measuring the prevailing market trend, identifying crucial support and resistance levels of it, and most importantly for forecasting potential corrective price action move. It is applied to the starting point of the trend and its apex - traditionally, but with the current example, it didn’t really fit well and I had to ‘think outside of the Fi-box’. That’s why I configured Fibo accordingly, taking into consideration how the price action interacts with the major supports/resistances on the charts. You may check yourself on the charts above, how well it all fits together with such a Fibo application, for BOTH of the charts.

So, dafaq is this false 0 level Fibo breakout, one may ask. This, my retarded friend, is a perfect example of a bull trap, which is happening simultaneously to the distribution market phase. And this is what is happening currently again, with all the “stonks only go up rhetorics”.

And what comes after 144 month bars / 4382 days long bull market + a bull trap?

2366,EOD," I have no position in $DKNG right now, and will edit by EOD if that changes (eyeing $50-$55 calls (6/18)).

The underlying bull case remains entirely intact -- and frankly is difficult to imagine that being budged by a publication named after a fucking blimp catastrophe. 

Its lobbying arm remains one of the most effective in navigating state legislatures -- which in several cases, has even led to the boxing out of their competition's access to certain markets. Exclusive partnerships with national leagues, and expansion to Canada also represent green lights for deepened investment. 

Frankly, Hindenburg may have shot itself in the foot by underscoring the value opportunity, and exposing how significant the short and longterm upside actually is.

I really wouldn't be surprised if we saw a runup to $60~ in a test of support.

NIO produces as of Q1' 2021 about 20,000 vehicles per quarter. They are still trying to grow. Their combined operating losses for the last three years, which is from when they started selling cars (so not counting the operating losses before that) is about $2.5B USD.

RIDE, which bought for cheap an old plant from GM that they were updating to produce their Endurance pickup truck, is not yet at any level of production and by year end is looking at having exhausted the $600M they had  without any significant level of production.

VW, has committed to spend over $90B on going to EV.

TSLA has raised multiple times billions of dollars to fund operations. It is only recently that they have been operating cash flow positive (and they still have raised more money to continue to expand... they might have crossed the threshold going forward and not need to raise more money, but will see).

All these companies have been able to put together a prototype for cheap, yet trying to actually move forward to production has been a major challenge that has cost a lot. Yet, somehow you think GOEV will magically escape the challenges of getting to production levels where they can be operating cash flow/income positive.

$600M is chump change here and unless they can raises substantial amounts of money more they will go bankrupt sooner or later. Maybe they can move forward and things will work out and investors will decide it is worthwhile to throw more money at them, but in an increasingly competitive landscape with established players finally moving, might not be so easy to raise that money.",aka0007,3,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o04hlq/canoo_goev_investor_day_on_thursday_617_could_be/h1uncf3/,0.039,0.872,0.088,0.9262

NIO produces as of Q1' 2021 about 20,000 vehicles per quarter. They are still trying to grow. Their combined operating losses for the last three years, which is from when they started selling cars (so not counting the operating losses before that) is about $2.5B USD.

RIDE, which bought for cheap an old plant from GM that they were updating to produce their Endurance pickup truck, is not yet at any level of production and by year end is looking at having exhausted the $600M they had  without any significant level of production.

VW, has committed to spend over $90B on going to EV.

TSLA has raised multiple times billions of dollars to fund operations. It is only recently that they have been operating cash flow positive (and they still have raised more money to continue to expand... they might have crossed the threshold going forward and not need to raise more money, but will see).

2442,GM," I had been in and out of RIDE since the beginning of December 2020. I have read every article and watched every video I could find on these electric trucks and the company, both the positive and the negative stuff.The tech is great. Each wheel has its own hub motor, so true all wheel drive, not with a differential that really only drives one front and one rear wheel at a time like 4WD.

2445,SP," The thing with $RIDE is that it will absolutely do 1 of 2 things -   
1)  go bankrupt  
2)  go to at least $20 in September when they start limited production  


So, will it be #1?  $GM owns 7.5M shares and has said they do not plan on selling.  All of the interim executives are being paid with shares.  Usually interim executives are paid cash, because they want to be paid if the company fails, working for shares is very bullish.    


Will production start in September?  the last CEO was forced out for overstating preorders and the new interim CEO has already stated that they will be starting production in September.  I don't think she would use her first company statement to repeat the sins of the CEO she just replaced.  


The only factor is capital.  They need additional capital to go into commercial production.  They have enough for limited production for September to the end of the year, but they need more for larger, commercial production next year.  


The company has $0 debt and more than $500M in cash/assets, there is little chance they will not be able to get an equity based loan (they have already stated no plans for dilution).  And once they do, the SP should go up significantly.  


One final thing, they are currently in due-diligence on an ATVM loan.",MMaschin,16,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o0gvas/allin_on_ride/h1v0hxy/,0.075,0.891,0.034,-0.859
